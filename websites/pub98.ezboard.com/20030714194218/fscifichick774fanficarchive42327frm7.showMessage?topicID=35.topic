Author's Note: Many thanks to my betas Sarah and Mona. I know, I'm actually using betas for this one. You're in shock aren't you? Anyway, I have a bad feeling this is going to end up being a really angst-ridden fic. There will be some humor, but I just know it's going to be heart wrenching. Also, I may end up raising the rating down the road. Just warning you, so you can turn away if you want.<br>

~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lex observed Chloe as she walked into the Talon and strode up to the counter, where she flashed Lana a bright smile. Clark had told him that Lana was now staying with Chloe and her dad until she finished high school. Lex seemed intrigued at the thought that Chloe could put her feelings for Clark aside and be friends with the girl he had a crush on. It certainly showed a character of spirit that most people didn't possess, himself included. Lex turned to Clark and smirked when he noticed that Clark was stealing a glimpse of Lana without her knowledge.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chloe seems happy,&quot; Lex said in an intentionally emotionless tone. Clark looked over at him and raised his eyebrows.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guess that's what love does to you,&quot; Clark said. Lex couldn't hide the surprise that flickered over his features.<br>
<br>
&quot;So it was Miss Sullivan that you were staring at just now?&quot; He asked. Lex thought Clark was still hung up on Lana. Entertaining the thought of Clark being with Chloe, the girl his own thoughts had been drifting to recently, was truthfully, a little troublesome. Clark blushed and his eyes widened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh, no, I,&quot; Clark stammered. Lex smirked again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lana,&quot; Lex answered for him. Clark blushed again and nodded. Lex was relieved, but kept it to himself. &quot;Why did you make the love comment then?&quot; Clark frowned ever so slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lana says she is, Chloe I mean. But she's only been dating the guy for two weeks. You can't fall in love with someone in just two weeks,&quot; Clark protested. Lex chuckled and sipped his coffee.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can fall in love right away Clark. There's even a term for it,&quot; Lex responded. Clark sighed and leaned his cheek against his propped up fist.<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess,&quot; Clark said. &quot;It would explain why Chloe hasn't had a lot of time for her friends lately.&quot; Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;New relationships have a tendency to do that,&quot; Lex said. &quot;Eventually she'll grow bored with him and you'll get your friend back.&quot; Lex knew that no one would be able to compete for Chloe's attentions if he ever chose to toss his hat in the ring, but he wasn't ready to do that. 'Maybe after she breaks up with this new guy,' Lex mused. Clark smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You sound pretty sure of that,&quot; he observed, snapping Lex out of his thoughts. &quot;But what if she doesn't get bored with him? Maybe she really likes him and will end up marrying him and--&quot; Clark stopped talking when Lex choked a little on his coffee. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Lex nodded and wiped his mouth with a napkin.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; Lex said, trying to cover up the fact that he was shocked at Clark's thoughts. Surely Chloe couldn't care that much about a boy, a high school boy at that, whom she had only been dating for a couple weeks. &quot;I doubt that's the case with Chloe, Clark. She's intelligent and witty, and regardless of how smart or good looking her new boyfriend is, the odds are he's not on her level of mental capacity. When she realizes that, she'll tire of him and move on to find someone more worthy of her.&quot; Clark's eyes widened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow,&quot; Clark said. &quot;Better not let Luke catch you saying that stuff.&quot; Lex creased his brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Luke?&quot; Lex repeated. It was one thing to have a nameless, faceless boy as competition, but naming him put a new spin on things. It made Lex feel slightly unsettled for some reason.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chloe's new boyfriend,&quot; Clark answered. &quot;And he is smart, he's an honor student.&quot; Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;But she just recently noticed him,&quot; Lex said. &quot;Which means that he can't be that spectacular.&quot; Clark laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, he just moved here from Coast City,&quot; Clark said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; Lex asked, his tone indicating that most people would have much preferred Coast City to Smallville. Clark smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey! Smallville's not that bad!&quot; Clark argued. Lex laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you say so,&quot; Chloe's feminine voice said from beside the table. Lex and Clark both looked up at her. &quot;Mind if I join you?&quot; She asked, already sitting herself down next to Clark. &quot;So what are you guys talking about?&quot; Clark smiled, but didn't answer. Lex, on the other hand, had no problem with the subject they had just been discussing.<br>
<br>
&quot;You actually,&quot; Lex said. Chloe raised her eyebrows in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name was brought up in a discussion that included 'Smallville's not that bad'? I think I should be insulted,&quot; she responded. Clark and Lex both chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not like that Chlo,&quot; Clark said. &quot;We were talking about you and Luke, and how Luke just moved here from Coast City.&quot; Chloe smiled and sipped her coffee.<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess I can forgive you then,&quot; she said. Clark rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gee thanks,&quot; he said sarcastically. Chloe gave a half laugh and then caught the clock on the wall with her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Crap! Is that the right time?&quot; She asked to nobody in particular. Chloe looked down at her watch, only to see that it had stopped. &quot;Ugh! Stupid watch,&quot; she mumbled. Chloe got up out of her chair and Clark frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; He asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have to meet Luke in like ten minutes and I'm going to be late,&quot; she said with a sigh.<br>
<br>
&quot;But you just got here,&quot; Clark complained. She gave him a compensatory smile and grabbed her bag. Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure you'll find a way to compensate with your driving speed Miss Sullivan,&quot; he quipped. Chloe gave a rather unladylike snort.<br>
<br>
&quot;If I was driving, then I wouldn't be late,&quot; she said. &quot;But I have no car today, and therefore, I'm hoofing it.&quot; Chloe waved at Clark and Lex as she started to walk away. &quot;Bye.&quot; Lana waved to her after she reached the front door and she gave her a smile and a wave. Lex frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;I should have offered her a ride,&quot; he said. Clark gave him a strange look.<br>
<br>
&quot;She wouldn't have taken it,&quot; Clark said. Lex tilted his head at the observation, not realizing that he had said what he thought out loud.<br>
<br>
&quot;Probably not,&quot; he agreed. &quot;But it wasn't very chivalrous of me not to even offer.&quot; The comment earned a full laugh from Clark.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think she sees you as chivalrous, and even if she did, I don't think Luke would be very happy seeing you give his girlfriend a ride,&quot; Clark said. Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;The jealous type is he?&quot; Lex asked in a way that it didn't sound like a question. 'If she doesn't end up dumping him, I can use that to my advantage,' he thought. Clark shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't know,&quot; Clark admitted and then smiled. &quot;But if I was going out with her and I saw you giving her a ride--&quot; Clark trailed off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Point taken.&quot;<br>

A tall, good looking boy with strawberry blond hair accompanied her. Lex frowned. Her boyfriend had a muscular build, although it appeared to be more toned than jock-like. He heard him laugh at something Chloe said and he furrowed his brow. He seemed so familiar, but he couldn't place him, and generally Lex was very good with details like that. Lex noticed that Clark was watching the couple as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Luke I presume?&quot; Lex commented to Clark. Clark glanced back over to Lex and nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he confirmed. &quot;She seems happy doesn't she?&quot; Clark observed. Lex arched an eyebrow at Clark's somewhat rueful tone, but decided not to comment on it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wonder why she came back,&quot; Lex thought aloud. Clark's eyebrows raised in surprise and pensiveness.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Clark admitted and casually looked around the place so Chloe wouldn't notice that he had been staring at them. &quot;It's not really the sort of place you take a date.&quot; Lex chuckled. &quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Isn't this where you and Lana spend the majority of your time together?&quot; Lex asked. Clark blushed.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not what I meant,&quot; Clark argued. Lex smirked. Chloe and Luke placed their order at the counter and then worked their way over to Clark and Lex's table. Lex noticed that Chloe was the only one with a cup of coffee in her hands. He smiled inwardly, or so he thought. Chloe smiled brightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you smirking about?&quot; She asked Lex. Luke laughed at the surprised expression that splayed across Lex's features, and Lex quickly covered his reaction.<br>
<br>
&quot;Back so soon Miss Sullivan?&quot; Lex asked, purposefully ignoring the fact that Luke was standing right next to her. &quot;Can't stay away from me?&quot; He teased. Chloe rolled her eyes and sat down next to Clark. Luke pulled another chair to the table so he could sit next to Chloe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, that's it,&quot; she said sarcastically.<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought you said you were going to be late to meet your boyfriend,&quot; Lex said.<br>
<br>
&quot;She was late,&quot; Luke answered. He tried to hide his displeasure at the fact that Lex was intentionally ignoring his presence. Chalk it up to being an only child, but Luke wasn't used to being ignored. He grinned tightly. &quot;So I drove in this direction on the hunch that she would be near some caffeine. And what d'ya know? I was right.&quot; Chloe slapped the back of her hand against his chest playfully and Luke's grin turned into a smile. Lex's tongue rested itself in the corner of his mouth and he narrowed his eyes a little when Luke and Chloe leaned closer to each other. Watching their lips about to connect, Lex decided to take action. He cleared his throat and Chloe and Luke pulled away from their almost-kiss.<br>
<br>
&quot;We haven't been properly introduced,&quot; Lex said and extended his hand. &quot;Lex Luthor.&quot; Luke squared his jaw slightly and gave him a weary and untrusting look, but it wasn't because of the Luthor name, or because of the fact that Lex hadn't been acknowledging his existence just moments before. Luke noticed the way Lex had been looking at Chloe when they first came into the building, and he didn't like it. And now, Lex was interrupting a 'moment' between him and Chloe. Despite his reservations, Luke extended his hand as well and shook Lex's.<br>
<br>
&quot;Luke Atherton,&quot; Luke answered. Lex gave a curt nod and a partial smirk.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you're Luke,&quot; Lex said in an observational tone. &quot;Clark tells me that you hail from Coast City. What brings you to Smallville Mr. Atherton?&quot; Lex asked. Luke raised an eyebrow at the formality of using his last name, but ultimately decided that the young man in front of him must just have some sort of weird mental complex. After all, who wears a suit to get coffee on a late Saturday afternoon?<br>
<br>
&quot;My dad,&quot; Luke responded. Lex gave a curt nod and took a sip of his coffee.<br>
<br>
&quot;Job transfer?&quot; Lex asked. Luke shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he answered. Lex noticed the strange look Luke got in his eyes. He seemed remorseful for some reason. Chloe gently touched Luke's arm and gave him a reassuring grin. &quot;My mother died a couple of months ago,&quot; Luke said in a choked, yet controlled voice. Lex's heart fell.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's okay,&quot; Luke said, although his tone indicated that it wasn't alright at all. &quot;She was sick for a long time. I think she was just tired of being kept alive by machines.&quot; Lex inwardly cringed. He could relate to Luke's story all too well. Luke gazed at Chloe with a loving expression and grinned. He placed his hand on the hand she had resting on his arm. &quot;That's actually one of the things that Chloe and I have in common.&quot; Lex and Clark shared a confused look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, my mom is still alive somewhere. But she's been gone for a long time and she's dead to me,&quot; Chloe said sadly. Lex was surprised at her sharp tone. Clark had told him about Chloe's mom deserting her and her dad and how upset she was by it, but he never pictured her as bitter about it, only heartbroken. Of course, that only meant that they had one more thing in common as well. He wondered if Chloe had ever considered that. Regardless, the atmosphere around their table had taken on a considerably sour tone, and it was time to change the topic. Lex turned his full attention on Chloe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clark tells me that you two have only been dating for a couple of weeks,&quot; Lex said bluntly. &quot;How did you meet?&quot; Luke smirked at Lex's obvious attempt to derail his status in front of Chloe. Lex narrowed his eyes slightly at the smirk. He knew that look, that exact smirk, but he still couldn't place the boy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chloe had to interview me for the school paper,&quot; Luke answered nonchalantly. &quot;We started talking and realized that we have a lot in common.&quot; Lex gave him a polite grin, but had to stifle a groan when he saw the way Chloe was looking at Luke.<br>
<br>
'She thinks she's in love with him,' Lex thought to himself. 'This could be more difficult than I thought.' Although he had no intention of actively pursuing Chloe immediately, he didn't want Luke to ruin his chances in the long run.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot; Lex asked with a mock interested inflection in his voice. &quot;Such as?&quot; Chloe shot Lex a look and he grinned at her over his mug of coffee. She leaned forward on her arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow,&quot; she said sarcastically. &quot;Why so interested in my life all of a sudden?&quot; Clark cringed at her tone and looked at Lex apologetically. Her comment didn't seem to phase Lex at all; in fact it seemed to only fuel the banter fire the two had been exchanging for a while now. Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just honing my investigative skills,&quot; he replied. Chloe laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gunning for my future position at The Daily Planet?&quot; She teased. Lex smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sadly no,&quot; he responded. &quot;But I think I could get hired on at The Inquisitor.&quot; Chloe smiled wider.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course you could,&quot; she said. &quot;You own it.&quot; Luke looked back and forth between the two with some suspicion. The way they used their wordplay was entirely too friendly. It could have been construed as flirting if they were talking about anything else. Luke decided to let it slide.<br>
<br>
Chloe had been honest with him, he was sure of that. No other girl he knew would admit to having a failed crush on her best friend, or being a 'mutant magnet' of sorts. But the most she had mentioned about Lex Luthor was that he basically owned the town, which he had already figured out for himself, and that he was a friend of Clark's. He trusted Chloe. Luke smiled to himself. Even if Lex did like Chloe, Luke surmised that he was really no competition for him. And he was going to make sure of it.<br>

He groaned when he pulled his car to a stop in front of his house. As if finding out about, and meeting, Luke in one day hadn't been enough; now he had to deal with his father. Although admittedly, part of him welcomed the anger release that verbally sparring with Lionel would bring. He strode into the house and briefly glanced at his butler as he handed him his things.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is my father in?&quot; Lex asked. The man nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; the butler answered. &quot;But he has company and has asked not to be disturbed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What company?&quot; Lex asked. His mind automatically went to one of his father's ex gold digging flings, which he really had no patience for dealing with right now.<br>
<br>
&quot;His first name is Michael,&quot; the man responded. &quot;He didn't give a last name, but your father recognized his voice and immediately invited him into his study.&quot; Lex gave a curt nod.<br>
<br>
'Interesting,' Lex thought. 'But it would be more interesting if I knew what he was up to.'<br>
<br>
&quot;He did ask not to be disturbed,&quot; the butler reminded him in a half warning voice. Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;If he wants privacy, he should move back to Metropolis,&quot; Lex responded. The butler said nothing, but shook his head slightly in disapproval and walked away from him. Lex began walking in the direction of his father's study. When he was a few doors away, he could hear raised voices. He neared the closed door of the study so he could hear what they were saying.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's MY son!&quot; A man's voice exclaimed in anger. Lex presumed that this was the 'Michael' that his butler referred to.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; Lionel sneered. &quot;He's *my* son.&quot; Lionel's voice was in a lower volume than Michael's, but Lex could tell from his tone that he was seething. There was a pause and Lex backed away from the door a couple of steps in case the other man decided to come storming out of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't do this,&quot; Michael said. Lex noted that it sounded like he was pleading with his father, and he had to stifle a snort at what the consequences would be.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can, and I will,&quot; Lionel said. Lex heard him sigh and he creased his brow. Surely Lionel wasn't going to give in? &quot;He doesn't know his biological father the way he should, a fact for which I feel deeply ashamed. With or without your blessing, I'm going to set things right.&quot; Lex frowned at this.<br>
<br>
'Biological father?' Lex thought. The first thought that came to mind was that Lionel had sired illegitimate offspring, but it wouldn't be the first time, and his father showed no interest in getting to know them before. 'What if they're talking about me?' He thought. He realized that he hadn't been told everything there was to know about his mother Lillian. He only had his own memories of her, and what various people had told him. He couldn't chastise her for having an affair of her own, certainly not with Lionel as her husband. Lex's mind was reeling. Could it be true? He was snapped out of his thoughts when his father and Michael started speaking again.<br>
<br>
&quot;As long as you know---&quot; Michael said.<br>
<br>
&quot;---Where you stand,&quot; Lionel finished and slightly paused before speaking again. &quot;I understand completely. Tomorrow then?&quot; Lex heard them say their gruff goodbyes and he leaned against the wall by the door. Michael exited and Lex nodded at him, carefully taking in his appearance. Michael was a little taller than he was. He had dark auburn hair that was cut short, he was handsome, and he was wearing well tailored clothes. Lex's eyebrows rose at the possibility that he was seeing his real father for the first time. He watched the man walk away and then he entered his father's study.<br>
<br>
&quot;Father,&quot; Lex greeted Lionel dryly. Lionel turned his head in the direction of Lex's voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Son,&quot; Lionel acknowledged. &quot;Dare I ask how much of that conversation you heard?&quot; Lex smirked. He always got right to the point didn't he?<br>
<br>
&quot;Not enough,&quot; Lex said. Lionel frowned and palmed the top of his cane.<br>
<br>
&quot;Meaning?&quot; He asked. Lex poured some scotch into two glasses and handed one to Lionel.<br>
<br>
&quot;Meaning that you should have told me about this sooner,&quot; Lex said. Lionel sipped his drink and then let out a sigh.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, well, you've always been a little volatile Lex,&quot; Lionel explained in a condescending tone that wasn't lost on his son. &quot;I wasn't sure how you would take it.&quot; Lex pursed his lips and stared at his father.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had the right to know,&quot; he stated adamantly. Lionel rested his tongue in his cheek and then nodded once.<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; he agreed. Lionel fumbled a little while finding a place to place his glass down and then he stood up. &quot;It's all out in the open now though.&quot; Lex shook his head in disbelief.<br>
<br>
&quot;No it's not,&quot; Lex said as he started to let his anger show. &quot;Why did you keep me from him all these years?&quot; Lionel stopped walking, but didn't turn around.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is any explanation I give you going to be satisfactory?&quot; He asked. Lex closed his eyes for a moment as he thought about it.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But I still want one.&quot; Lionel grinned slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone wants something Lex,&quot; he said. Lionel walked out the door and left Lex alone in the study to think about what had just happened. Lex still hadn't gotten any answers. He realized that was typical when dealing with his father, but he still needed to know. Lionel's words to Michael drifted through his head.<br>
<br>
'Tomorrow then?'<br>
<br>
Lex took the last swig of his drink and set his glass down. It was going to be a long night.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
&quot;You're kidding?&quot; Chloe asked. Luke shook his head. They were now sitting in a restaurant in town. It had decent food, but a great atmosphere if you wanted to have a good conversation. &quot;Why didn't you tell me that you were adopted before?&quot; Luke shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I usually don't think about it I guess. My parents are the only parents that I've ever known and I've just kind of accepted it.&quot; Chloe smiled brightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You still should have told me,&quot; she said. Luke rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why? So you could research who my birth parents are?&quot; He asked. Chloe got a gleam in her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you want me to?&quot; She asked hopefully. Luke smiled and shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nah,&quot; he said. &quot;But if I ever change my mind about wanting to meet them I'll be sure to let you know.&quot; Chloe laced her fingers together and rested her chin on them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I guess that's something,&quot; she said a little begrudgingly. Luke eyed her new demeanor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; He asked in clearly concerned voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; she said with a sigh. &quot;And I don't mean to be a one person crusade to reunite all of my friends with their real parents, but you know, with my mom and everything.&quot; She trailed off hoping that it would be enough of an explanation. Luke looked a little confused though.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who else have you tried to reunite?&quot; He asked. Chloe cringed and looked down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clark,&quot; she admitted. &quot;Although he was really upset about it because I didn't exactly ask for permission first.&quot; Luke chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Meaning that he specifically told you not to and you did anyway,&quot; he said. Chloe blushed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know me too well,&quot; she mumbled. Luke's smile didn't fade.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't even know that Clark was adopted,&quot; he said, trying to change the topic to lessen her embarrassment with her previous behavior. It worked. Chloe established eye contact again and nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yep,&quot; she confirmed. &quot;For a while, it even looked like he might have been Lionel Luthor's illegitimate son.&quot; Luke looked thoughtful.<br>
<br>
&quot;Luthor? Related to Lex?&quot; He asked. Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;His dad,&quot; she said. Luke raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Clark and Lex would have been brothers?&quot; He asked. Chloe nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, but it wasn't true,&quot; she said. &quot;The DNA test proved it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, at least he knows for sure,&quot; Luke said. Chloe grinned. There was a small lapse in the conversation as they were staring at each other. They both realized it and blushed. Luke reached across the table and took her hand. He started to draw patterns on it with his fingers and she smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have an Uncle Lionel,&quot; Luke finally said. Chloe looked surprised.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot; She asked. &quot;It's not that common of a name.&quot; Luke shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, it's not,&quot; he agreed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you like him?&quot; Chloe asked. Luke grinned as their fingers intertwined.<br>
<br>
&quot;I haven't seen him in a while,&quot; he said. &quot;But yeah, he's nice. Weird, but nice.&quot; Chloe looked bemused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Weird?&quot; She queried. Luke shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;When he would visit, he used to bring me these books.&quot; Luke shook his head and chuckled at the memory. &quot;They were way too advanced for my age, but he always said that I couldn't get an early enough start on reading the classics.&quot; Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I find it difficult to believe that anything was too advanced for you,&quot; she said. Luke smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was five when he brought me 'The Art of War',&quot; he said. Chloe laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's what he considered a classic?&quot; She asked in amusement. He nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you he was weird.&quot; Luke's phone vibrated and he answered it. &quot;Hello?&quot; He gave Chloe an apologetic look and she just shrugged and picked at her food.<br>
<br>
&quot;Luke,&quot; a man's voice came through.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Dad,&quot; Luke greeted. &quot;What's up?&quot; He heard his father hesitate on the other end of the phone. &quot;Dad?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Luke, there's something I need to tell you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

Chloe noticed his concerned tone and suddenly became interested in the conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you're on a date right now, but I'd like to discuss it in person. Do you think Chloe will mind if you call it a night and come home early?&quot; His father asked. Luke frowned and looked over at Chloe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hold on,&quot; Luke said into the phone. He covered the receiver with his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;My dad said he needs to talk to me in person about something important,&quot; Luke said. Truthfully, Michael hadn't said it was important, but Luke could tell that it was from the way his dad was acting. &quot;Do you mind if we leave early?&quot; Chloe was taken aback by the surprise. She had only met Michael Atherton a couple of times, but he seemed as laid back as her own father did. If he needed to talk to Luke in person, then it must be something big. She gave him a consolatory grin and shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;No problem,&quot; Chloe responded. Luke reached across the table and clasped his hand around hers as a thank you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay Dad, I'm on my way,&quot; he said. Luke hung up his phone and got his wallet out to pay for their meal. He looked at Chloe. &quot;Are you sure you're okay with this? You could come with me if you wanted.&quot; He stood up and Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; she said as she stood up. Luke placed the money on the table and then took hold of her hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're sure?&quot; He asked. Chloe nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said. He smiled lovingly at her and gave her a kiss on the cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll give you a ride home.&quot;<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lex drove back to The Talon. With everything that was going through his head, he needed a place to think that wasn't near his father. He couldn't believe what he heard. It did occur to him that he was jumping to conclusions, but if that was the case, why did Lionel not bother to deny any of it? Lex didn't know if he would be able to wait until tomorrow to find out what was going on. It was driving him crazy. He stared absently at a spot on the wall and barely heard a female voice calling his name.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lex? Hello? Earth to Lex,&quot; Chloe said and waved her hand in front of his face. Lex looked up at her, a startled expression crossing his features. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; He asked, intentionally avoiding her question. She raised an eyebrow and sat down in the seat next to his.<br>
<br>
&quot;Public gathering place, coffee, need I go on?&quot; She asked with a smirk. Lex grinned at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not what I meant,&quot; he corrected. Lex leaned toward her ever so slightly. &quot;I meant what are you doing here on a Saturday night without your boyfriend in tow?&quot; Chloe took a sip of her coffee.<br>
<br>
&quot;If that's what you meant, then you should have been more specific,&quot; she replied. Lex leaned back in his chair.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have yet to answer me,&quot; he observed. She shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;You didn't answer me either,&quot; she countered. He looked at her with a blank expression. &quot;When I asked if you were okay?&quot; She reminded him. Lex frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;I find discussing your life substantially more interesting,&quot; he said. He didn't want to get into this with her. Not only was she a reporter, but he wasn't sure he would feel safe opening up to anyone about what was going on. Let alone the woman he had been developing feelings for.<br>
<br>
&quot;Liar,&quot; Chloe said with a grin. She took another drink from her mug and then set it on the table. Lex cleared his throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;So what are you doing here on a Saturday night?&quot; He asked again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not my choice,&quot; she mumbled. Chloe forced a fake grin on her face. &quot;Okay, that's not true,&quot; she admitted. &quot;I could be home watching a horror movie on the sci-fi channel, but I just couldn't get into it.&quot; Lex arched an eyebrow at her. &quot;What? It's not like there are a lot of options for Saturday night in Smallville. It's not like Metropolis where I could flirt with a bouncer and go dancing or something.&quot; Lex gave her a stern look.<br>
<br>
&quot;You haven't done that have you?&quot; He asked in a tone that was hesitant and warning at the same time. Chloe grinned impishly and brought her mug up to her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not telling,&quot; she said. Lex squared his jaw.<br>
<br>
&quot;You could get in a lot of trouble at one of those places Chloe,&quot; he said. Chloe smiled and nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; she agreed. She looked down when she saw the disapproving look on his face. &quot;So-oo,&quot; she strung out, &quot;why are you here on a Saturday night?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Long story,&quot; he answered. Chloe nodded once. &quot;You still haven't told me where Luke is.&quot; Chloe grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;You never asked where Luke was,&quot; she said. Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Touché,&quot; he replied. &quot;So where is he?&quot; Chloe sighed and took another drink of her coffee. It was almost gone now and she frowned. Lex saw her expression and misinterpreted it. &quot;Trouble in paradise?&quot; 'One can only hope,' he thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, nothing like that,&quot; Chloe answered quickly. &quot;His dad called while we were having dinner and asked him to come home early.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure it was his dad on the phone?&quot; Lex asked. If nothing else, Lex was a skilled manipulator. If he could plant doubt in Chloe's mind as to her relationship with Luke, then he would stand a better chance later on. Chloe didn't fall for it however, and grinned sympathetically at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just because you've had the experience of being in relationships where people screw you over, doesn't mean that everyone is like that Lex,&quot; Chloe said. Lex looked at her in a new light, intrigued that she could be so snarky and perceptive at the same time. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn't mean for that to come out as mean as it sounded.&quot; Lex grinned as an acceptance of her apology.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did his father need him to come home early?&quot; Lex asked, changing the topic back to something that wouldn't get him in as much trouble. If she kept being nice to him about his 'issues', he would start talking about what was bothering him in no time, and he couldn't allow that. Chloe shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;He said he had something important to talk to him about,&quot; Chloe responded. She frowned again when her cup was completely empty. Lex saw her staring at the bottom of her cup this time and his lips curled into a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Want a refill?&quot; He offered and stood up. &quot;My treat.&quot; Chloe's eyes lit up and she smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot; She asked hopefully. Lex chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;What were you drinking?&quot; He asked. Chloe told him and he went to retrieve another cup for her. He came back and handed it to her. She smiled again and took a sip of the scalding hot beverage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mmm,&quot; she said with approval. &quot;You sure know the way to a girl's heart.&quot; Lex smirked, but said nothing as he sat down. The bells on the front door chimed loudly and both Lex and Chloe turned their heads in the direction of the sound. Chloe waved when she saw that Luke had come into The Talon. Lex barely managed to bite back a groan of displeasure. He and Chloe were getting along so well, and Clark hadn't been there to get in the way. Luke walked over to their table, a stunned expression on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your dad told me you would be here,&quot; Luke remarked and sat next to Chloe. The expression stayed the same. Chloe glanced over at Lex, wondering if he noticed the strange way Luke was acting. She realized that they had just met earlier that day and Lex probably wouldn't know Luke was acting strangely if he started to sprout antennae out of his head, so she looked back at Luke. She furrowed her brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bad news?&quot; She asked, referring to the conversation he had with his father in the time they had been apart. Luke shook his head like he was in a daze.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Luke said. Chloe leaned forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you going to tell me?&quot; She pressed. Her sense of curiosity was bubbling over now. Luke grinned as he came back to his senses.<br>
<br>
&quot;He said that---&quot; Luke shook his head again in disbelief. &quot;He said that my 'real' father lives here and he wants to meet me.&quot; Chloe's eyes grew wide as she took in what he was saying.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; she paused. &quot;That's great.&quot; She looked over at Lex, who had a stone-like expression on his face. Her attention went back to Luke. &quot;That's great right?&quot; Luke shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're adopted?&quot; Lex finally asked, trying to break the tension that had suddenly built around the table.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Luke responded and nodded a couple of times. &quot;And it's weird, because Chloe and I were just talking about it when we had dinner.&quot; Lex grinned as he turned to look at Chloe.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're developing psychic abilities?&quot; He asked. Chloe snickered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; she joked. &quot;Soon I won't even need to bother you about an interview.&quot; Luke caught the almost seductive curl of Lex's lips as they turned upward.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're not a bother Chloe,&quot; Lex said. Chloe rolled her eyes and concentrated on Luke. Her boyfriend inwardly smirked at her reaction to the other man. He knew well enough that many women would be impressed at the very fact that a rich young man would be sitting at the same table as them, but not Chloe. Not *his* Chloe.<br>
<br>
&quot;So are you going to meet him?&quot; Chloe asked Luke, trying to return them to the original topic of conversation. Luke smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, tomorrow,&quot; he answered. Luke rubbed his hands together. &quot;I'm nervous,&quot; he admitted. &quot;My hands are getting kind of sweaty.&quot; Lex guffawed at the boy's lack of courtesy in the conversation, but creased his brow when he noticed that Chloe didn't seem to mind. In fact, she was actually smiling.<br>
<br>
'I would have to like someone who prizes honesty,' Lex thought to himself. He watched Chloe and Luke look at each other and frowned. He pushed himself away from the table and stood up, suddenly catching Chloe's attention.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're leaving?&quot; She asked. Lex nodded, pleased that she had even noticed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a busy day tomorrow,&quot; he said. He figured that it wasn't a complete lie. She smiled at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, have a good night,&quot; Chloe said. Luke smiled at him too.<br>
<br>
&quot;See ya,&quot; Luke said. Lex gave a curt nod and left them alone at the table. His drive home was full of tortured thoughts of Chloe and Luke, mixed with what he had overheard from his father earlier. A brief thought passed through his mind. Luke was meeting his 'real' father tomorrow, his biological father. Lex slammed on the brakes and stared at the long empty road ahead of him. It couldn't be true. Certainly he would have pieced it together before now if it were. On the other hand, he had been considerably distracted by being around Chloe. She had taken his mind off the situation almost entirely. Add to that the fact that he was stubborn, and had convinced himself that his theory about him being the one who was illegitimate, and you had a recipe for full on denial. But the fleeting thought turned out to be persistent.<br>
<br>
'Luke equals Lucas,' Lex thought. &quot;Crap.&quot;<br>

It was still early and there was a frost in the air that made the appearance of the home seem all the more chilling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why does he want to have breakfast with me?&quot; Luke asked his dad. &quot;And why here? I thought this was the Luthor house?&quot; Michael Atherton paled a little, but he patted his son on the back.<br>
<br>
&quot;He just wants to get to know you,&quot; Michael explained. &quot;And this is the Luthor residence.&quot; Luke's eyebrow shot up and he crossed his arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;What? Is he like a butler or something?&quot; Luke asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Something,&quot; Michael mumbled under his breath. Luke gave him a strange look, but said nothing. Michael stepped up to ring the doorbell. A tall man answered the door and Luke scanned him carefully with his eyes. He couldn't see any resemblance. Of course, one would think since his biological father had specifically requested to see him, whoever it was would be more pleased to see him. The butler showed the two men into a waiting room and told them that someone would be with them soon. Luke took in the place. Overstated and pretentious, but he guessed they had to do something to cover up all that space.<br>
<br>
At the same time, Lex paced around his office. He hadn't had breakfast yet, as he had lost most of his appetite since his revelation the night before. He also had gotten very little sleep and was agitated. His father told him that Lucas was dead. Lex blamed himself for not questioning the lie. And now, from what he heard, his father was impassioned about meeting Luke as his biological father and establishing a relationship with him.<br>
<br>
'Probably because I won't be his lapdog,' Lex mused to himself. He shook his head. It wasn't that simple. It never was with his father. Lionel always had several webs to his scheming, and Lex was certain that he had an intricate plan in place, regardless of what front he put up. Lex heard the doorbell when it rang moments earlier, and was trying to put off the inevitable confrontation that was to come. 'Better get it out of the way,' he thought. He opened the door and began to walk toward the waiting room where he knew Luke would still be seated. For some reason, Lionel insisted on promptness from others, but rarely showed them the same courtesy, especially if they were there at his request.<br>
<br>
Lex made it down the stairs and saw Luke out of the corner of his eye. The boy didn't look uncomfortable at all. He looked like he was sizing the place up. Lex wondered if the emotions Luke had shown Chloe the night before, about being nervous and apprehensive, were all part of an act. He sucked in a breath. If Luke had been acting, then Lex had a greater adversary in him than he originally thought. Lex put on his game face and started to stroll toward the open spot in the wall that separated the waiting area from the main entryway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Atherton,&quot; Lex greeted dryly. Both Luke and Michael's heads swung around to look at Lex. Michael furrowed his brow. He didn't recognize the man standing in front of him. He noticed the smirk on his son's face and saw Luke hold out a hand as Lex did the same.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Lex,&quot; Luke said. The two young men exchanged a look that made Michael incredibly nervous. Their relationship, if any, didn't seem terribly friendly, and he wondered how Luke had made enemies in Smallville already.<br>
<br>
&quot;You seem to be faring better than you were last night,&quot; Lex observed in a casual tone. Luke smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Definitely,&quot; Luke agreed. &quot;Nothing like a good night's sleep to calm your nerves.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course,&quot; Lex said, holding back his true thoughts and the questions that he wanted to ask. Like, how could Luke possibly sleep when he himself hadn't been able to get more than an hour's worth the entire night? Or if someone had been sharing Luke's bed for part of the night? Lex sloughed off the last thought. Chloe would never do that, and especially not with a boy she had only known for less than a month. Michael cleared his throat and Luke grimaced ever so slightly at the fact that he had forgotten to introduce them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Luke apologized. &quot;Lex Luthor, this is my Dad, Michael Atherton.&quot; The two men shook hands and Michael stepped back. So this was Lionel's son? Well, the one he claimed anyway. Lex had something about him that made Michael feel almost frightened. He supposed it had something to do with the fact that he was raised by Lionel instead of it being genetically inherited. After all, Luke didn't have that quality, at least not with him.<br>
<br>
&quot;So do you know why we're here?&quot; Luke asked Lex, shaking his father out of his thoughts. &quot;It almost seems like you were expecting us,&quot; he observed. The question, not the statement, took Lex off guard and he shot Michael a quizzical look. The expression on the older man's face said it all. He hadn't told Luke the identity of his biological father. Lex felt sympathy for the man, and surprisingly for Luke too. What a blow to have to have Lionel come charging into their lives like that.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was,&quot; Lex admitted to Luke. Luke raised an eyebrow. &quot;My father and I had a brief discussion about you yesterday.&quot; 'Sort of,' Lex thought. Luke was surprised.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; Luke asked. Lex was about to answer him when the tapping of a cane sounded in the hallway. He turned around to see his father walking into the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dad,&quot; Lex said coldly. Luke's eyebrows shot up when he recognized the man. His hair was a little longer and less polished now, and he hadn't been blind when he last saw him, but it was definitely his Uncle Lionel.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lex,&quot; Lionel greeted with a sneer. Luke looked back and forth between them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uncle Lionel?&quot; Luke asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lucas,&quot; Lionel said cheerfully. &quot;I was told you were here.&quot; Luke eyed the man with confusion and suspicion. He turned to look at Lex again.<br>
<br>
&quot;So we're cousins?&quot; Luke asked, not bothering to hide that he was clearly appalled by the thought. Lex inwardly cringed at what he needed to say in response, but turned it into a half smirking expression.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brothers,&quot; Lex clarified. Luke's eyes widened and his mouth dropped down a little bit. &quot;Well, half brothers technically.&quot; Lionel smiled and made his way toward Luke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, and we have a lot to catch up on my boy,&quot; Lionel said. Luke paled and felt like he was going to pass out. Lex felt a pang of guilt again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; He asked Luke, who was now struggling for balance while standing up. Luke barely managed to shake his head and Lex motioned to Michael to help his son. Michael wrapped his arm around Luke's back and helped him to a chair while Lex poured him a glass of water.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's going on? Is something wrong?&quot; Lionel asked, not knowing the situation that was happening around him. Lex bit the inside of his cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;Luke's not feeling well,&quot; Lex answered. &quot;Maybe you should reschedule your reunion for another date.&quot; Lionel looked worried.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lucas?&quot; Lionel asked in a concerned voice. What worried Lex is that the concern sounded genuine. Great. He was never going to get the love and attention that he required from his father when he was younger, and now it seemed that his half brother was going to develop the relationship that he had always wanted with his dad. Luke focused his eyes on Lionel and then over to Lex. He could see Lex's conflict of emotions and felt bad for him.<br>
<br>
'Sympathy for the man who wants to steal my girlfriend away from me,' Luke thought. 'I must be going crazy.'<br>
<br>
&quot;Lex is right,&quot; Luke said, pushing himself off of the chair. He was steadier on his feet now than he had been, and was trying to sound sure of himself. If there was one thing he remembered about being around Lionel, it was that he appreciated self-confidence. &quot;I'm not feeling well, and I wouldn't want to get you sick.&quot; 'Not that it's contagious,' Luke thought to himself. Lionel grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;How thoughtful,&quot; he responded. &quot;But quite unnecessary. You're here to have breakfast with me. Just cough in the other direction.&quot; He turned around and started to tap his cane as he walked. Luke watched him leave in disbelief. He turned to his dad for an explanation, but Michael simply took a deep breath and gave him an apologetic look. Lex came up behind him and slapped his hand on his back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome to the family,&quot; Lex said dryly.<br>
<br>
Luke and Michael followed Lionel and Lex as they walked toward the dining room. Luke decided to take the opportunity to mark his territory, so to speak, but it wasn't about his surroundings. He tilted his head toward Michael.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can see why this place creeps Chloe out,&quot; he said in a low voice that was just loud enough for Lex to hear. Lex squared his jaw and silently told himself that he wouldn't let Luke play mind games with him about Chloe. Obviously Luke had figured out that Lex liked her, and that was definitely to his advantage rather than Lex's. Lex kept walking straight ahead, but responded to Luke's comment.<br>
<br>
&quot;The fact that she was pushed out a window from the second floor probably has something to do with it,&quot; Lex said coolly. Luke's eyebrows rose in surprise. Chloe hadn't told him that. Why had Chloe not told him that?<br>
<br>
&quot;Who pushed her?&quot; Luke asked accusingly. Lex smirked and then turned around to face Luke, but continued to walk only now in a backwards motion.<br>
<br>
&quot;We were in the middle of an interview when some burglars broke in. In their haste to get away, one of them pushed her out the window,&quot; Lex said and then turned back around. &quot;She didn't tell you?&quot; Lex jabbed over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
To an outsider, the conversation would have seemed a little on the stranger side of normal, but normal none the less. They had a mutual friend whom they were discussing and that was it. To someone who knew one or the other's mannerisms though, it was a completely different play on words. Michael took a deep breath. He really didn't want to get in the middle of this, but if he stuck by Luke, then he had a better chance of not losing him to Lionel's darker influence. They reached the dining room right as he asked the question and Lex proceeded to sit down. Lionel insisted that his sons sit on either side of him with himself positioned at the head of the table. Michael sat next to Luke on the opposite side.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know Luke's girlfriend?&quot; Michael asked Lex. Lex was about to answer him when Lionel grinned and butted into the conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have a girlfriend Lucas?&quot; Lionel queried. Luke was glad that Lionel couldn't see him wince when he called him by his full first name. Nobody except Lionel did that, and the way he made it sound was like he wasn't accepting of who Luke was as a person, but rather who he wanted him to be. Luke cleared his throat and took a sip from the glass of water in front of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; he answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir? My, that's formal,&quot; Lionel commented. &quot;You can call me father if you'd like.&quot; Lex winced at that one. Lionel never pulled any punches. The man who raised the boy was sitting at the same table and Lionel had the audacity to make a comment like that. Luke glared at his biological father, again grateful that he had lost his sight.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd rather not,&quot; Luke retorted. A strange expression crossed over Lionel's face, one of remorse or regret, but it was gone just as soon as it arrived, and he replaced it with a smug grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course,&quot; Lionel said. &quot;All things in time.&quot; Lex glanced at Luke and gave him a sympathetic look. Despite the fact that Lex liked Chloe, Luke found himself wanting to side with him. It was transparent that Lex and Lionel were at odds about several things that had gone on between them in their lives, and Luke didn't want to be on the team that would make intentionally vicious comments with no regard to people's feelings. Luke found himself wondering if this brother thing wasn't such a bad situation after all. Maybe he could even convince Lex to give up his crush on Chloe. That was really the only thing standing in the way of them becoming friends. That, and Lionel.<br>

He turned his head in Luke's direction and gave his best attempt at a friendly grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;You said that you had a girlfriend Lucas?&quot; Lionel asked. Lex looked up from his plate to Luke.<br>
<br>
'This ought to be good,' Lex thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's her name?&quot; Lionel asked. &quot;Tell me about her.&quot; Luke swallowed the bite of food he had been chewing and smiled.<br>
<br>
'Poor guy doesn't know what he's in for,' Lex thought. 'But it should definitely prove to be entertaining.'<br>
<br>
&quot;Her name is Chloe,&quot; Luke answered. He was about to say more when Lionel cut him off.<br>
<br>
&quot;And does Chloe have a last name?&quot; Lionel asked. Luke rolled his eyes. Lex grinned. If his father was trying to win Luke over, he was doing a horrible job of it. Luke's next statement caught Lex completely off guard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, I think so,&quot; Luke said sarcastically. &quot;But she's considering dropping it and just going by her first name like a lot of actresses do.&quot; Lex coughed on the orange juice he was drinking and a little of it flew from his mouth. He looked at Luke, who had a giant smile across his face. Luke's smile seemed to be contagious, as one spread on Lex's own lips as well. Lionel, however, wasn't amused. The serious expression on his face caused Luke to burst out in laughter and Lex chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see,&quot; Lionel said. &quot;You were joking.&quot; He said it so dryly that it made Luke cringe. &quot;Well, good to know that you feel comfortable enough around me to do so. Now, what's her last name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sullivan,&quot; Luke replied. &quot;But I don't see why it matters, it's not like you know her.&quot; He mumbled the last part and shoved some eggs into his mouth. Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, he does,&quot; Lex said. &quot;Her father is the plant manager.&quot; Lionel's eyebrows rose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gabe Sullivan's daughter?&quot; He asked. Lionel shook his head in disapproval. &quot;She's only dating you for your money; you'll have to break things off with her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What money?&quot; Luke scoffed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a Luthor son, you need to be wary of women who will only date you to serve their own advancement in this world,&quot; Lionel said in a completely serious voice. Luke smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I didn't know that you were my biological father until like an hour ago,&quot; Luke reminded him. &quot;And Chloe doesn't even know yet, so she's obviously not dating me because of that.&quot; Lionel looked thoughtful.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, a valid argument,&quot; Lionel conceded. &quot;But just imagine how she'll react when she does find out. No doubt she'll want you to take her shopping or something.&quot; Luke frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, she'll probably think about dumping me,&quot; he said with a completely straight face. Lex tried to hide the grin that was forming on his lips.<br>
<br>
'I'll have to tell her for you,' Lex mused to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;I seriously doubt that. I would think that being a Luthor would only endear you to her more,&quot; Lionel said and then felt around until he reached his cup of coffee. Luke shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't know her,&quot; he objected. &quot;She's not like that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All women are like that,&quot; Lionel retorted.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you have against Chloe?&quot; Luke asked a little angrily. His temper was starting to rise and having breakfast with this jerk who turned out to be related to him wasn't helping. Lex chuckled and looked at Luke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Lex said to him. &quot;That's the problem.&quot; Luke looked confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Luke asked. Lex glanced at his father and took a deep breath before explaining the situation to Luke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Last year, at some horrible company function, he had a little too much to drink. Chloe was there because of Gabe, and dear old dad started to hit on her,&quot; Lex said. A smirk etched itself onto Lex's face as he turned to look at Lionel. &quot;She called you a 'lecherous old man' if my memory serves me correctly. And I'm fairly certain she would have slapped you if her father hadn't gotten to her in time.&quot; Luke smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, that sounds like her,&quot; he said. Lionel's eyes grew wide.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was Chloe Sullivan?&quot; Lionel asked. &quot;Goodness, she's lovely.&quot; Luke and Lex both frowned. &quot;And quite spirited. I'm surprised you were able to get her to go out with you in the first place.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Gee thanks,&quot; Luke said sarcastically.<br>
<br>
&quot;That didn't come out the way I meant it,&quot; Lionel said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right,&quot; Lex said. &quot;The way he meant it was if he, in an inebriated state, couldn't get her to pay attention to his clumsy advances, then surely no other man would be able to woo her.&quot; Luke laughed and Lionel let out an aggravated sigh.<br>
<br>
&quot;And here I thought I would be thankful if you two ended up getting along,&quot; Lionel said. Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be careful what you wish for,&quot; he responded.<br>
<br>
Breakfast ended rather uneventfully and Lionel made Luke promise to come to see him again soon. After Lionel left to go to his study, Lex walked Luke and Michael to the front door. His father may have forgotten his manners, if he had them to begin with, but Lex hadn't.<br>
<br>
&quot;So,&quot; Luke said.<br>
<br>
&quot;So,&quot; Lex repeated. There was a slight pause and Lex frowned. &quot;Are you going to tell Chloe?&quot; Luke arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;If I don't, you will,&quot; Luke said bluntly. Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Glad to know we're on the same page,&quot; he replied. Luke gave a curt nod and turned to open the door. He opened it and his dad stepped ahead of him onto the porch. Luke swung around once more to look at Lex.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I almost forgot,&quot; Luke said. He turned to look at Michael quickly and asked him to wait for him at the car. Michael left and Luke looked back at Lex. &quot;I was hoping you could decipher something Chloe said for me.&quot; Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can try, but I should warn you that I'm not completely fluent in Chloe's language,&quot; Lex kidded. Luke nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;She said something about going to Metropolis just to spite you. You wouldn't happen to know what she meant by that would you?&quot; Luke asked. Lex pursed his lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Was she serious?&quot; He asked. Luke shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hard to say,&quot; Luke admitted. Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't worry about it,&quot; Lex said. &quot;If she was serious, she would be doing it to spite me, not you.&quot; Luke grinned too.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good point,&quot; he agreed. &quot;Of course it might help if I knew what you two had been talking about.&quot; He arched a suspicious eyebrow at Lex and Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure it would,&quot; Lex responded cryptically. Luke resisted an eye roll. Lex had been pretty good about siding with him during breakfast, and it could very well be that he was just being paranoid about the situation since he and Chloe hadn't been dating that long.<br>
<br>
&quot;I should go, Dad's waiting for me,&quot; Luke finally said. Lex nodded and extended a hand for him to shake.<br>
<br>
&quot;Luke,&quot; Lex said. Luke smiled at the use of his first name.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lex,&quot; he said and shook his hand. Luke turned and walked out the door. Lex watched Luke until he got to the car and then he shut the door. Lex wondered if Chloe would actually go to Metropolis to flirt with a bouncer and go dancing just to make him angry.<br>
<br>
'Of course she would,' Lex thought. The corners of his mouth curled upward. He couldn't help but think that the beginning of the end of her relationship with Luke would be coming soon. He looked forward to that day.<br>
<br>

Lionel Luthor was his biological father. He had sort of teamed up with Lex over breakfast to tease Lionel. There was something else that he wasn't telling her though, she could tell from the tone in his voice and the look in his eyes. It was like he was checking for her reaction every time he mentioned Lex's name. She wondered why he would be doing that. He sounded optimistic for the future though. Not so much as far as having a relationship with Lionel, but as far as having a brother in Lex. She smiled brightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's great news,&quot; Chloe said. &quot;I guess.&quot; She was still a little dazed from having him wake her up and start regaling his tale of what happened at breakfast. &quot;How do you feel about it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hard to say,&quot; Luke admitted. He wished that she had chosen the couch to sit down on so he could sit next to her, but it probably wouldn't be the appropriate time to start kissing her anyway. &quot;How do you feel about it?&quot; Chloe looked at him quizzically.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it doesn't really affect me Luke, not like it affects you,&quot; she answered. &quot;You're the one whose life has just taken a major turn.&quot; Luke nodded. &quot;Have you told anybody else?&quot; Luke shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Came straight over after I dropped my dad off at home,&quot; he said. Chloe kept a straight face and he tilted his head at her. &quot;He's still my dad Chlo,&quot; Luke misinterpreted her expression and tried to explain. &quot;He's the one who raised me, the one who was always there for me. This new information doesn't change that.&quot; She nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know,&quot; she said. He arched an eyebrow and she took a deep breath. &quot;It's just---&quot; she paused while trying to think of a delicate way to phrase what she needed to say. &quot;Some things run genetically in families, and I don't want you to change.&quot; Luke frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're friends with Lex,&quot; he pointed out. &quot;I don't see how it's any different.&quot; Chloe shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm acquaintances with Lex, not friends,&quot; she corrected. &quot;And I know that he's had a pretty awful life in spots.&quot; Luke's look told her to continue. &quot;I also know that Lionel Luthor is the closest thing to Satan that Smallville will probably ever see.&quot; An expression of understanding passed over Luke's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you're worried because, technically, I'm his spawn,&quot; Luke said. Chloe smiled apologetically.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;It sounds ridiculous. I'm just having trouble shaking the feeling that Lionel Luthor is going to be a negative influence on you.&quot; He smiled and walked over to her, holding out his hand to help her out of the chair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you'll balance it out,&quot; he said comfortingly. They kissed and Chloe smiled when they pulled apart from each other. Her smile fell when she noticed the serious expression on Luke's face. &quot;May I ask you a question?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow,&quot; she teased. &quot;Correct grammar and everything.&quot; Luke smiled. &quot;Sure, go ahead,&quot; Chloe said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you willing to forgive Lex for his genetic makeup but not me?&quot; He asked with a tinge of jealousy that Chloe missed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't take it personally,&quot; she said. &quot;I've just known him longer. I know how much he's been through to try and become a person that you want to be friends with, someone who looks out for the people he cares for and not just himself.&quot; Luke furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you don't think I'm like that?&quot; He asked in a hurt voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you've been like that from the start, but it's a different story when you have to overcome natural selfish tendencies because of the way you were raised,&quot; she said. Luke nodded. That made sense. Chloe got a sparkle in her eye. &quot;You almost sound like you're jealous.&quot; Luke frowned and tightened the grip of his hands on her waist.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe I am,&quot; Luke replied, not completely admitting to it.<br>
<br>
&quot;You shouldn't be,&quot; Chloe said. &quot;I'm sure that you'll end up having a much deeper friendship with your brother than I ever will.&quot; Luke tried to hold back his surprise at her comment. She thought that he was jealous because she was trying to be 'friends' with Lex?<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess you're right,&quot; Luke said. Chloe smiled again.<br>
<br>
&quot;So I don't suppose I could get an interview with the newest Luthor?&quot; She asked. Luke chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You really do have a one track mind don't you?&quot; He asked. Her smile didn't diminish.<br>
<br>
&quot;Or maybe a joint interview with you and Lex?&quot; She asked. Chloe got a distinctive sparkle in her eyes as she imagined the possible headlines. Luke opened his mouth to speak, but she cut him off. &quot;Ooh, that would be great.&quot; Luke arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yeah, really great,&quot; he said sarcastically. &quot;Considering how well your other interview attempts with Lex have gone.&quot; Chloe wouldn't be defeated that easily though. She stepped away from Luke and brushed off the comment.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll be there too this time, that can only bring good luck,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Or bad luck,&quot; Luke mumbled. Chloe shot him a questioning look.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot; She asked. Luke ran a hand through his hair and faked a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing,&quot; he lied. He couldn't very well tell her that he had no desire to watch Lex flirt with her for the duration of the interview; because he knew that she would just deny it and say that he was being paranoid and ridiculous.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Chloe said as she crossed her arms. Luke sighed and shook his head at her. He gave her his best smile, but she still looked unconvinced.<br>
<br>
'To tell her or not to tell her? That is the question,' Luke thought. Against his better judgment, he decided to opt for the first.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think he likes you,&quot; Luke finally said. Chloe stared at him blankly for a moment and then smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everybody likes me,&quot; she joked. &quot;Can you be more specific?&quot; Luke chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lex,&quot; he answered. Chloe's smile didn't fall.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course he likes me Luke, I'm his best verbal sparring partner,&quot; she said. Luke rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not what I meant,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine,&quot; Chloe said. &quot;What did you mean?&quot; Luke shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;He *likes* you,&quot; Luke clarified. Chloe smiled and tried to hold back her laughter, but it didn't work and she started laughing hysterically.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, okay,&quot; she said through her laughter. &quot;Whatever you say honey.&quot; The corners of Luke's mouth started to curl upward. Chloe's laughter was contagious.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't believe me?&quot; He asked. Chloe shook her head and held her stomach as she started laughing harder. &quot;I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or not,&quot; Luke said to himself. Chloe's laughter tapered off and she gave Luke a halfway sympathetic look.<br>
<br>
&quot;You were serious?&quot; She asked in disbelief. He stared at her and she shook her head. &quot;O-kay. What makes you think that?&quot; She asked. Luke shrugged and went to sit down again.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can just tell,&quot; he said. Chloe smiled and went to sit down next to him. She rested her head on his shoulder and he grinned down at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would it help if I said you were completely off base?&quot; She asked. Despite his frustration with the situation, Luke found himself laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he said sarcastically. &quot;That's a big help.&quot; She kissed his cheek and he turned his face to kiss her properly.<br>
<br>
&quot;This isn't going to be a problem is it?&quot; Chloe asked. &quot;Because despite what I said earlier, I really would like to be friends with Lex, and I want you to get to know your brother.&quot; Luke rubbed his face with his hands and faked a grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he lied. &quot;You're probably right. I was probably reading too much into the situation and he only likes you as a friend.&quot; Chloe's face brightened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly,&quot; she said. Chloe snuggled up to him and their mouths were millimeters apart. &quot;Now where were we?&quot;<br>
<br>

Two weeks since he told Chloe that he suspected that his half brother liked her. Luke used the time to his advantage. He made sure that Chloe and Lex hadn't run into each other at all. Unfortunately, his plan to keep them apart came to an abrupt halt when she informed him that Lex had agreed to the joint interview with him that she had mentioned previously. Now he sat with Chloe at a table in The Talon as they waited for Lex to show up. Chloe looked positively giddy.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't believe he actually agreed to this,&quot; she said. Luke frowned. He didn't find it hard to believe at all.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course he did,&quot; Luke mumbled under his breath. Chloe arched an eyebrow at him, but decided to say nothing. She didn't want to have this fight again. She didn't understand how he could be so paranoid about something that wasn't even the truth. Instead, she brought her mug up to her lips and took a sip of her coffee, pretending that she hadn't heard his comment. Luke smiled at her reaction and she grinned back at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You two look cozy,&quot; Lex said as he suddenly appeared at their table. Chloe smiled brightly at him and Luke gave him a polite nod.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lex,&quot; Luke greeted and held out a hand. Lex shook it and then sat down across from Chloe. Luke glared at him slightly, but said nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss Sullivan,&quot; Lex said. Chloe's smile seemed to grow wider.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Luthor,&quot; she replied. Lex was grinning and Luke felt incredibly uncomfortable with the immediate chemistry the two seemed to have. He wondered if Chloe noticed it. He knew Lex did. A waitress came by the table and Lex placed his order. He turned back to look at Chloe.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's been a while since I've seen you Chloe,&quot; Lex said in a casual manner. Chloe nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know,&quot; she said. &quot;I've been pretty busy lately.&quot; Lex cast a glance at Luke through the corner of his eye. There was no doubt in his mind that Luke had been trying to keep Chloe busy so she wouldn't have time to run into him or her other friends. Clark had told him as much.<br>
<br>
&quot;The life of a reporter I suppose,&quot; Lex said. Chloe smiled again and tucked some hair behind her ear.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Chloe agreed. &quot;So what have you been up to?&quot; Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't realize that the interview had started already,&quot; he replied. She laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;It hasn't,&quot; she said. &quot;I was trying to be polite.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah. So you don't really care how I've been spending my time?&quot; Lex asked. Chloe leaned forward a little.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't say that,&quot; she said. Lex smiled and Luke groaned. Lex and Chloe both looked over at him questioningly. The second she saw the expression on his face, she knew what Luke was thinking. She tilted her head at him. &quot;Please don't start this again,&quot; she pleaded in a half hushed voice. Luke grumbled and crossed his arms. Lex looked at him suspiciously. The only reason he hadn't interfered in their relationship yet was because he had actually grown to like his brother, and he figured that the boy had enough common sense to treat Chloe correctly. Lex was now wondering if that wasn't a big mistake on his part.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't start what?&quot; Lex asked sternly. His question was directed at Luke, but Chloe answered it. She sat up straight in her chair with a determined look on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're settling this right now,&quot; she told Luke. Lex looked over at her and arched an eyebrow. She smiled at him. &quot;Luke has a crazy idea in his head-- -&quot; Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just one?&quot; Lex interrupted. Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;He thinks that you like me,&quot; she continued. Lex furrowed his brow and then stared blankly at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have I given you any indication that I don't like you Chloe?&quot; He asked. A soft smile spread across her lips and she shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not as a friend,&quot; she answered. &quot;He thinks that you *like* me.&quot; Lex gave a knowing look to Luke, who squared his jaw.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see,&quot; Lex said dryly. Chloe smiled smugly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly. So will you *please* tell him once and for all that he's imagining things so we can go on with our lives?&quot; Chloe asked. Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why would I do that?&quot; He replied in a teasing tone. Chloe narrowed her eyes at him a little.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't tease him Lex,&quot; Chloe warned. &quot;Not about this. He's actually concerned for some reason.&quot;<br>
<br>
'As well he should be,' Lex thought to himself. Luke listened to them banter back and forth and finally just shook his head and stood up. Chloe looked over at him with big eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; She asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;You two obviously don't need *me* here,&quot; Luke responded somewhat bitterly. Chloe closed her eyes and then stood up to stop him. She tugged on his sleeve and gave him a look that begged him to stay.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's just teasing you,&quot; Chloe said. &quot;Please stay.&quot; She gave him a small smile. &quot;It won't be any fun without you.&quot; Luke grinned and Lex barely resisted rolling his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't say that,&quot; he said to Chloe suggestively. She tilted her head at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you knock it off?&quot; She asked, although it came out as more of an order. Lex grinned and nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I apologize Luke,&quot; Lex said. &quot;I didn't realize that you'd take my joking around so seriously.&quot; Chloe smiled and turned to Luke.<br>
<br>
&quot;See? He was just teasing you. That's what brothers do,&quot; she said. Luke sighed and sat back down. Chloe grinned, pleased with the result, and was about to take her seat again as well when Lex interrupted her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chloe?&quot; Lex asked. She looked over at him. &quot;Would you mind if I speak with my brother for a few minutes alone before we start the interview?&quot; At first she looked surprised, but then she seemed amused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; She asked. &quot;You want to get your stories straight?&quot; Her voice held a teasing lilt and Lex grinned at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Something like that,&quot; he said. &quot;You don't mind do you?&quot; Chloe shrugged and smiled at Luke.<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess not. As long as I don't end up getting a lot of vague answers,&quot; she said. Lex nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks,&quot; he said. Chloe shook her head lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll just go talk to Lana for a little bit,&quot; she said as she motioned toward the counter. &quot;Let me know when you're ready.&quot; Chloe picked up her things and started walking away from the table. &quot;Behave yourselves,&quot; she threw over her shoulder. Lex chuckled and Luke smiled. Once she was out of earshot, Lex turned to look at Luke. The expression on his face was enough to make Luke shudder slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell do you think you're doing?&quot; Lex growled. Luke glared at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think I should be asking you that,&quot; he responded. &quot;She's *my* girlfriend.&quot; Lex shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not for long with the way you're acting,&quot; Lex said. &quot;You've been keeping her away from me and away from her friends, trying to make dependent on you in some way, so that she doesn't feel she can live without you. And then you throw a temper tantrum when your plan doesn't work. There's a term for that behavior Lucas, it's called emotional abuse.&quot; Lex was angry and his words spit out at Luke like venom. Luke paled. He didn't realize he had been acting that way, at least not to that extent. His only intention had been to keep Lex away from his girlfriend.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't---&quot; Luke shook his head and his mouth hung open, stunned by what Lex had just ranted at him. Lex pushed his chair away from the table and stood up. He glared at Luke threateningly.<br>
<br>
&quot;If I had known about your behavior toward her, then I would have ended it a long time ago. She's not yours, not anymore,&quot; Lex said. His very expression was a stern warning. &quot;You so much as come near her without her friends or family around, and you won't live to regret it.&quot; Lex turned on his heel and began to walk toward Chloe.<br>
<br>
Luke sat there in fearful silence as Lex's words kept repeating in his head. He had never seen anyone so angry or threatening in his life and the worst part was that he believed him. He believed him about everything. Luke ran his hands over his face in a subconscious attempt to hide his shame for how he had been treating Chloe. He promised himself then and there that he would find a way to make it up to her, and to win her back, no matter what.<br>
<br>
Lex walked over to Chloe, only having calmed down a little bit. She creased her brow when she saw the upset expression lining his features.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; She asked. Lex placed a possessive hand on the small of her back and gave her a concerned look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why didn't you tell me?&quot; He asked in a lowered voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why didn't I tell you what?&quot; She asked, matching his volume. Lex sighed and cast a quick glance in Luke's direction to make sure that he was heeding his warning.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what's wrong with him, but I know he's not stable,&quot; Lex said. Chloe frowned. Lex started rubbing her back in a comforting motion. &quot;You must have noticed Chloe.&quot; She said nothing, but looked down and then nodded a couple of times. Lex let out a breath and wrapped his arms around her. He pulled her head to his chest and began to stroke her hair a little. Chloe was surprised by the action, but she surmised that he must be upset about the situation too, and maybe this was his way of trying to deal with it. &quot;It's not safe for you to be around him alone anymore,&quot; Lex said as he let her pull away from him. He immediately missed the contact, but allowed it. &quot;Keep someone else with you at all times until we get this settled, alright?&quot;<br>
<br>
Chloe could feel tears starting to form in her eyes. The first guy she had gone out with who wasn't some sort of meteor affected psycho, and he turned out to have a chemical imbalance or something. She grimaced as she put the pieces together in her head. His mother had stalked Clark and tried to kill Lex. Now she was in a mental hospital herself. She looked up at Lex.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you think you could give me a ride home?&quot; She asked in a choked voice. He grinned gently and nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course,&quot; he answered. He walked her to the front door and shot one more look at Luke, warning him not to follow them.<br>
<br>
The first five minutes of the drive to her house was made in tempered silence as she sniffled and stared out the window.<br>
<br>
&quot;How are you holding up?&quot; Lex asked. Chloe shook her head numbly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I just feel so stupid for not seeing it before,&quot; she said. Lex furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;God Lex, his mom was - is - crazy. She wouldn't believe that Clark wasn't her son, she kidnapped and tried to kill you,&quot; Chloe explained and shook her head again. &quot;It's probably something that's genetic.&quot; Lex arched an eyebrow. He hadn't thought of that. He thought that Luke was just an overly possessive jerk of a boyfriend, but Chloe's reasoning fit in much better with his plan to get her away from him. &quot;I should have listened to Clark,&quot; she mumbled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why? What did Clark say?&quot; Lex asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, the usual speech when it comes to anyone who I've dated. I don't trust him, something's going on, you should be careful,&quot; she rattled off. Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's your friend Chloe, he's just trying to look out for you,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know,&quot; Chloe responded. &quot;I just --- I was hoping that this time he was wrong. You know?&quot; Lex pursed his lips and nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know,&quot; he said as he pulled the car up into her driveway. She let out a small gasp when she misread the expression on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Lex, I'm so sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn't mean anything by that. It's still hard for me to remember that you two are related.&quot; Lex kept a stoic look on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's okay Chloe,&quot; he said reassuringly. &quot;You're hurting as much as I am.&quot; He wondered if she believed that. It was only a partial lie. He wasn't hurting at all over the fact that Luke was going to be out of Chloe's life, but it did pain him to know that he had let it go on as long as it did. &quot;I'll walk you to your door,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to speak with your dad.&quot;<br>

The evening had been emotionally exhausting for her and Lex got the not so wonderful job of telling Gabe the reasons behind it. Gabe shook his head after Lex explained what had been happening with Luke.<br>
<br>
I dont get it, Gabe said in disbelief. I didnt see anything wrong. He seemed so nice. He was a good guy. Lex gave him a carefully measured look.<br>
<br>
He is nice and he is a good guy, generally speaking, Lex said. Unfortunately he has some mental issues that are probably genetic and he needs help. Gabe nodded. I dont think you should allow Chloe to see him unless there are other people around.<br>
<br>
Thats a bit extreme, dont you think? I mean, if he gets help ---<br>
<br>
He hasnt gotten help yet, Lex reminded him. And theres a very real possibility that he may reject having anyone help him. It might even be best to not let her see him at all until hes receiving treatment, and even then it should probably be on a wait and see basis. Gabe tilted his head at Lex.<br>
<br>
Youre taking kind of a personal interest in this arent you? Gabe asked.<br>
<br>
If youre asking if I would be acting this way if it were anybody else that Luke was dating, then the answer is probably not. But, Chloe and I are friends, or at the very least were getting there, and I dont want to see her get hurt, Lex answered honestly. Gabe seemed surprised by his bluntness, but found himself grinning at his boss.<br>
<br>
Okay, Gabe said. Lex looked over to the staircase.<br>
<br>
Do you think shes asleep yet? He asked. Gabe shook his head.<br>
<br>
Probably not, Gabe answered.<br>
<br>
Would you mind if ---<br>
<br>
You want to say goodnight to her? Gabe asked. Lex had a stoic expression on his face.<br>
<br>
I just want to check on her, Lex answered. Gabe nodded.<br>
<br>
I understand, he said. But dont be surprised if she gets upset with you for invading her personal space. Gabe gave him a small grin and a pat on the shoulder and then Lex headed up the stairs to the room he saw Chloe go into earlier. He lightly rapped on the door and Chloe, thinking it was her dad, answered it. Her eyes were red and watery from crying, and she looked completely surprised to see Lex standing there. Lex tried to ignore the fact that she was just wearing an oversized t-shirt and underwear and he gave her a sympathetic look.<br>
<br>
Can I talk to you? He asked. She looked out into the hallway and Lex grinned. Its okay, your Dad knows I came to check on you before I left. Chloe nodded absently and stepped to the side to allow him access to her room. She shut the door after he entered and he turned around to face her. How are you holding up? Chloe closed her eyes for a second.<br>
<br>
Ive been better, she said. Lex took a few steps forward, closing the gap between them. He wrapped his arms around her in a comforting manner and Chloe leaned her head against his chest as she hugged him back. Im so sorry, she whispered. Lex creased his brow, but didnt move from the embrace.<br>
<br>
You have nothing to be sorry for, he said in a hushed voice. She sniffed.<br>
<br>
I should have seen it sooner, we could have gotten him help, he might have been okay by now, Chloe rambled. Lex tightened his arms around her.<br>
<br>
Chloe, listen to me. Theres nothing that you could have done sooner than now. Youve only been going out with him for a short time, you had no way of knowing what he was like before now, Lex said. Chloe took a breath and then sighed. Lex moved to release her from the embrace and she frowned. She didnt realize how comfortable she felt in his arms until he let go of her. She went over to sit on her bed and Lex followed without asking. He sat next to her and gave her a small grin.<br>
<br>
So what happens now? Chloe asked. Do you take him to a hospital or what are you going to do? Lex appeared pensive.<br>
<br>
I think thats probably our best course of action, Lex said. They can refer us to the right people from there. Chloe nodded. Lex noticed that she seemed lost in thought. Chloe ---<br>
<br>
I dont want you to have to take sides Lex, Chloe interrupted.<br>
<br>
I already have, Lex admitted. Chloe looked at him questioningly. Hes my brother. And I hope that someday, after hes been receiving treatment for a while, that he and I can be friends and have the kind of relationship that my father robbed us of, but that day is a long way off. Chloe looked at the floor and Lex frowned when he realized that she had misunderstood him. Chloe youre my friend now. I dont want this thing with Luke to get in the way of that. Chloe looked up at him with wet eyes and he wrapped an arm around her back. Chloe leaned over and rested her head on his shoulder. Lex tried very hard not to let her notice that his breath hitched when she did so. There was a lapse in the conversation as they sat there against each other.<br>
<br>
Lex?<br>
<br>
Hmm?<br>
<br>
Can I ask you a question? Chloe asked. Lex looked down at her and grinned, but she didnt notice.<br>
<br>
Sure, he said.<br>
<br>
Why do you think Luke concentrated on you? She asked. Lex arched a quizzical eyebrow.<br>
<br>
What do you mean? He asked.<br>
<br>
I mean, he wasnt jealous of Clark or Pete, and I spend way more time with them than I do with you, Chloe said. Lex frowned. He could tell her the truth and risk her running back to Luke thinking that he wasnt crazy after all, or he could lie. Either way he risked losing his foothold on the relationship he was trying to build with her.<br>
<br>
Some kind of warped sibling rivalry I guess, Lex answered noncommittally. Chloe thought about it.<br>
<br>
That makes sense, she finally said in a quiet voice. Being so close to her, and yet so far, was slowly driving Lex crazy. He knew he had to leave before he did something that would jeopardize any sort a future with her. He leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. Chloes eyes grew wide and Lex grinned as he stood up.<br>
<br>
Have a good night Chloe, he said. Ill call you tomorrow, okay? She nodded and Lex left her room and closed the door behind him. Chloe sat stunned on her bed for a good two minutes before she moved. He kissed her. Granted, it was on the cheek, but he still kissed her. Chloe convinced herself that Lex didnt mean anything by it; that it was just a friendly gesture and he was doing it to comfort her and maybe even himself. She walked over and turned off her bedroom light. She went to bed wondering why the tingle in her cheek hadnt gone away yet.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Luke followed the butler down the darkened corridor until they got to a closed door. The butler opened the door and announced his presence to Lionel, then left, leaving him alone in the room with his biological father.<br>
<br>
To what do I owe this pleasant surprise? Lionel asked. Luke took a seat across from him.<br>
<br>
I need help, Luke admitted. Lionel looked intrigued.<br>
<br>
With what? He asked.<br>
<br>
Lex has convinced Chloe that I have some sort of mental imbalance and hes going to keep her away from me, Luke said, getting right to the point. Lionels face betrayed no emotions that he may have felt at the news.<br>
<br>
It sounds like its for the best, Lionel said. If shes so willing to believe the worst about you, then you dont need her. Luke cringed and rubbed his face.<br>
<br>
Yeah, well theres the thing, Luke said. Not everything he told her was a lie. Luke went on to explain everything that had happened and his reasons behind it, namely trying to keep Lex away from Chloe. Lionel listened intently as Luke told him his side of things, and smirked when Luke finished.<br>
<br>
What do you need me to do?<br>

<br>
Im so glad you decided to come with us tonight, Lana chirped. She looked at Clark and Pete and they both smiled and nodded. Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
Like I had a choice, Chloe replied. It seems like you guys havent<br>
been letting me go anywhere or do *anything* by myself lately. Lana, Clark, and Pete shared a look. Chloe caught it and stopped walking. Okay you guys, whats going on? Lana bit her bottom lip and silently looked to the boys as if for permission. Clark and Pete both frowned and Lana gave a small sigh.<br>
<br>
We just didnt get to see you much when --- Lana trailed off and Chloes face registered with her new understanding of the situation.<br>
<br>
Oh, Chloe said. Lana touched Chloes arm sympathetically.<br>
<br>
Im sorry, Lana said. Chloe arched an eyebrow at her friends and put her hands on her hips.<br>
<br>
So did my dad put you up to this following me around thing? Because Im capable of taking care of myself, you know? Chloe went into full-on rant mode. And Luke was  is  a nice guy. He just has some issues he needs to work out. Its not like hes material for my wall of weird like some of the other guys that Ive dated. Pete cleared his throat and Chloe rolled her eyes. Fine. *All* of the other guys that Ive dated, she corrected. Pete smiled at her and Chloe couldnt help but return it. Anyway, if thats why you guys have been hanging around with me *constantly*, Id really appreciate it if youd knock it off. Without another word, Chloe shook her head and started to walk away from them.<br>
<br>
Think we should go after her? Clark asked. Lana frowned.<br>
<br>
I think she just needs time, Lana said. Break-ups are hard, and we *have* kind of been crowding her lately.<br>
<br>
Yeah, not to mention the fact that Chloes all personal space girl anyway, Pete agreed. Clark watched Chloe walk further down the street and couldnt help but wonder whether they were doing the right thing.<br>
<br>
The first place Chloe spotted that interested her was The Talon. Her friends were supposed to be going to a movie, so she felt relatively safe in the knowledge that they wouldnt be there for a couple of hours. She walked into the building and glanced around the room. She recognized a few faces from school, a few others from around town, and then her eyes fixed on the bald man sitting alone in the corner. Chloe placed her order and took a deep breath as she regarded him.<br>
<br>
She didnt want to intrude on his alone time, because God only knew how much she disliked her friends doing the same thing to her for the last week; but she couldnt get his last words to her out of his head. He was her friend, or wanted to be. And he had kissed her on the cheek, although Chloe realized that was probably the most chaste thing Lex had ever done with a member of the opposite sex, friend or otherwise. She didnt realize that she had walked directly over to his table until she heard his voice calling to her through her thoughts. She looked startled and he looked amused.<br>
<br>
Sorry, Chloe said. She smiled at him and shook her head slightly. I guess Ive been a little out of it lately. Lex nodded and Chloe started to walk away from the table. A look of complete surprise passed over Lexs face.<br>
<br>
Chloe, he called out. Chloe turned around. Youre not going to join me?<br>
<br>
I shouldnt, she said. To be honest, I just kind of drifted over here on auto pilot. Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
Maybe your body is trying to tell you something, he teased. Chloe laughed and rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
Or maybe I just havent gotten my caffeine fix yet, she argued. Lex half-heartedly shrugged.<br>
<br>
I suppose that *could* be it, he said. Chloe shook her head in amusement and Lex motioned to the chair next to him. Please sit. Chloe grinned and pulled the chair out to sit down. Lex glanced over to the counter then back at her. Youre alone? He asked. Chloe took a sip of her coffee and rolled her eyes yet again.<br>
<br>
Yes  finally, she said. Lex arched an eyebrow and Chloe took another drink from her cup. I know they mean well, trying to help me get over Luke and everything, but theyve been driving me nuts.<br>
<br>
Clark and Lana? Lex asked for clarification. Chloe nodded.<br>
<br>
And Pete, she added. They smiled at each other and Chloe felt her palms start to sweat. She inwardly frowned. She was nervous? Thats ridiculous, why would I be nervous? She thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Theyre your friends Chloe, Im sure theyre just trying to look out for you, Lex said.<br>
<br>
Maybe, Chloe said. But if I ever start stalking my friends like that to help them get over a break-up that might have not been necessary in the first place, then --<br>
<br>
What do you mean it might not have been necessary? Lex asked with a frown. Have you talked to him?<br>
<br>
Hes called a couple of times, Chloe admitted. Lexs eyes flashed with an unspoken anger.<br>
<br>
I see, he said. And how did those conversations go? Are you considering getting back together with him? Please say no, he thought.<br>
<br>
They were alright. He seems really apologetic and keeps saying that he was only trying to keep you away from me. She said the last part with a small laugh, but Lex didnt smile. As far as getting back together --- Chloe shook her head. I dont think so. Lex let go of the breath he had been holding in, but Chloe didnt notice. He still has some obvious issues that he needs to work on and he still seems jealous of you for some reason. Lexs mouth twitched into a small smirk.<br>
<br>
Well, you did come over to my table without even thinking about it, he teased. Chloe laughed.<br>
<br>
So, what do you think?<br>
<br>
About? Lex asked.<br>
<br>
Do you think I should give him another chance? Chloe asked.<br>
<br>
I didnt think you should have been with him in the first place, Lex said, letting the words slip passed his lips without thinking about it first. Chloe raised her eyebrows and Lex took a sip from the cup in front of him.<br>
<br>
Why not?<br>
<br>
When I first saw you two together, it just didnt look right, Lex admitted. Chloe glared at him.<br>
<br>
Gee, thanks, she said sarcastically.<br>
<br>
Dont get defensive, he said. My instincts about people are usually right. Chloe eyed him warily and then brought her mug up to her lips.<br>
<br>
I dont suppose we could change the topic now? She asked.<br>
<br>
Of course, he said, quickly adding, As long as it doesnt have anything to do with Lex Corp business. He smirked at her and Chloe smiled broadly.<br>
<br>
What about Luthor Corp? She asked.<br>
<br>
Well, technically thats my fathers company, so I dont have any information to give you on it; but if you know about something, then feel free to share, he replied. The corners of Chloes lips started to curl upward in an almost mischievous manner and Lex arched an eyebrow. You know something? He asked with surprise.<br>
<br>
I didnt exactly come about it  whats the word? She paused. Legally, she finished. Lex leaned toward her.<br>
<br>
And for some reason that doesnt bother me. Tell me, he prodded. She tilted her head.<br>
<br>
Im sure you already know it anyway, Chloe said dismissively. Lex grinned at her and leaned closer.<br>
<br>
Ill be your best friend, he said in a hushed singsong voice. Chloe coughed on the sip of coffee she had just taken and then she started laughing.<br>
<br>
You wouldnt want to be my best friend Lex. I can be very demanding, she said. Lex partially rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
This from the woman who ditched her friends so she could have some time alone, he observed. Chloe noticed the stubborn gleam in his eye and shook her head.<br>
<br>
Fine, she agreed, letting out a small sigh. But if I end up dead because of this, then its your fault. Lex grinned and Chloe tried to ignore how close they were to each other now. You know Trinity Industrial? Lex nodded.<br>
<br>
They do mostly military contracts, some private industry, he confirmed.<br>
<br>
Right, Chloe said. Well, heres the part that you dont know  or maybe you do, and youre just humoring me --- Chloe trailed off and Lex cleared his throat and gave her a pointed look to continue. Okay, Trinity Industrial is not a real company. Lex furrowed his brow. Theyre a shadow subsidiary company under a few other subsidiary companies, but<br>
when you trace all of them back through the money trails and paperwork, they lead back to Luthor Corp. Lex leaned back in his chair and gave her a look of utter disbelief. He shook his head.<br>
<br>
Thats not possible, he said. They would never be able to fulfill all of those contracts if they werent a real company.<br>
<br>
Ah, the beauty of a well designed money laundering operation, she said with a smug smile. They usually get fill the orders by using their sweat factories overseas to manufacture the items. Charge a lot, spend a little, filter illegal goods under a so-called reputable companys name; and if something along the line screws up, there are no direct links back to Luthor Corp or your dad. Lex absently nodded and Chloe frowned. It all sounds kind of convoluted the way I described it, but when you see it on paper, it actually makes sense. Lex flashed her a small smile.<br>
<br>
It makes sense anyway. Im impressed, he said.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Chloe said with a smile. Lex looked thoughtful.<br>
<br>
Tomorrows Saturday. Do you think you could drop off copies of the paperwork you referred to? He asked. Chloe shook her head.<br>
<br>
Cant, she said. After a ridiculous amount of begging on my part, my dad finally agreed to let me tag along to that convention in Metropolis that youre sending him to for the weekend.<br>
<br>
Why would you want to go to a fertilizer convention? Lex asked. Chloe laughed and got an impish smile on her lips.<br>
<br>
I dont, she said. Lex narrowed his eyes at her and the realization of what she was saying struck him.<br>
<br>
No, he said. Chloe arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
No?<br>
<br>
No, Lex repeated. Youre not going to Metropolis so you can flirt with some bouncer to let you into a club where you shouldnt be in the first place. Chloe leaned forward and smiled at him.<br>
<br>
Actually, thats exactly what Im going to do, she responded.<br>
<br>
Chloe, he said in a warning voice. Chloe shook her head stubbornly.<br>
<br>
Dont even try to talk me out of it, she said. I never get the chance to dress up in those kind of clothes in Smallville, let alone go dancing  well, except at school functions, and I think weve all seen how well those turn out. Anyway, my point is that after everything thats happened, I need a break. Do you understand? Lex eyed her suspiciously.<br>
<br>
What kind of clothes? He asked. Chloe got a Cheshire-like smile on her lips.<br>
<br>
I think youve been to enough clubs to know what the dress code is, she replied.<br>
<br>
Chloe, he warned again. Do you know how much trouble you could get into at one of those places? Chloe sloughed off the comment.<br>
<br>
Would it make you feel better if I got you copies of the documents tonight?<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
So you just dont want me to go dancing then, is that it?<br>
<br>
I just dont want you to get hurt, he corrected.<br>
<br>
You may not believe this, but I am capable of taking care of myself Lex. And even if I wasnt, theres nothing you can do about it.<br>
<br>
Not true. I could tell your dad.<br>
<br>
But you wont because you want the documents that prove that your dad is involved in illegal activities, she countered.<br>
<br>
Speaking of which, why havent you used that information for an article yet?<br>
<br>
Like I said, they werent exactly legally obtained, she said. But Im guessing that you would find a way around that. Lex nodded. So just be my friend and be happy for me. There was a lapse in the conversation as they tried to stare each other down. Lex squared his jaw and managed to force a grin onto his face.<br>
<br>
Youre right, he said. Youre young and you deserve to have some fun. Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
Thank you, she said. Lex leaned back in his chair.<br>
<br>
So which clubs were you thinking about hitting? He asked as casually as he could.<br>
<br>
Just one actually. My friend Lucy knows the bouncer at Meridian.<br>
<br>
Meridian, Lex repeated with considerable distaste. Chloe --- Chloe shot him a warning look and he held up his hands in mock surrender. But Meridian, he shook his head, At least let me get you in someplace nice. He leaned toward her, so near that Chloe could feel his breath against her ear. Please? Chloes breath hitched and she turned her head to<br>
answer him.<br>
<br>
Le- Her speech cut off when she accidentally brushed her lips against his.<br>
<br>
She tried to pull back in embarrassment, but Lex palmed her cheek and brought her closer again. He softly brought their mouths together and started to kiss her. Chloes eyes fluttered closed at the sensations that were coursing through her body. Her hand moved to the back of his neck to try to keep the contact. Lex darted his tongue out to taste her and<br>
Chloe opened her mouth. Their tongues danced together and Chloe finally broke away from him when she was in desperate need of oxygen. She sat there, breathing heavily, and her eyes grew wide with the realization of what had just happened. Oh, God, she whispered as a shocked look crossed her face. Luke was right.<br>

<br>
Chloe, wait, he said. Chloe stilled and turned to look at him, but said nothing. Lex stood up, tightening his grip on her hand. Its not what you think. Chloe pulled her hand away from him and crossed her arms.<br>
<br>
Okay, so what do I think? She asked. Lex sighed as he stared down at her.<br>
<br>
You said Luke was right, but he wasnt.<br>
<br>
You just kissed me, Chloe argued. Lex stepped closer to her and moved his free hand around her waist. His head leaned toward her and for a second Chloe thought that he was going to kiss her again, but instead she felt his warm breath against her ear.<br>
<br>
We kissed each other, he corrected. Lex glanced at her face through the corner of his eye and saw that her eyes were closed. He took that as a good sign. Lex kissed the shell of her ear and peppered kisses across her cheek until he reached her lips. In one fluid movement, Chloes arms were wound around his neck and they were kissing passionately. Chloe pulled away from him to breathe and Lex rested his forehead against hers. Chloe?<br>
<br>
Hmm?<br>
<br>
Luke was right, Lex whispered. Chloe gave a slight nod of her head.<br>
<br>
I know, she replied in a hushed voice.<br>
<br>
That doesnt excuse the way he treated you, he said.<br>
<br>
I know, she said again. Lex brought his mouth to hers and gave her a sweet, almost chaste kiss. Chloe smiled to herself and Lex raised an eyebrow. So I guess this means you dont want me to get back together with him, huh? Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
I didnt want you to be with him in the first place, he responded and kissed her again. They didnt notice the eyes boring a hole through them from the outside window. Luke stood there with his hands clenched at his sides, ready to kill his brother for stealing Chloe away from him. He took a deep breath and remembered his conversation with Lionel. He needed to show restraint over his emotions if he was ever going to get her back. Luke took out his cell phone and hit a speed dial number.<br>
<br>
Luthor, Lionel answered.<br>
<br>
You said you were going to help, so help, Luke spat angrily into the phone.<br>
<br>
Lucas, Lionel greeted. You sound upset.<br>
<br>
Hes kissing her! Do something! Luke growled. Lionel arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
Hes kissing her? Ah, this must have something to do with that Sullivan girl, he mused aloud. I thought you said she wasnt interested in him, Lionel questioned. Luke sighed and ran a hand through his hair.<br>
<br>
Just do something, he pleaded. Im never going to get her back if Lex keeps on her like this.<br>
<br>
Calm down son. Things will be taken care of, Lionel said and hung up the phone. He seemed thoughtful before picking up the phone again. He had originally agreed to help Lucas with the situation to get closer to his son and to add fuel to the fire of antagonism that he and Lex had going, but now Lucas sounded desperate. Weak. Lionel fingered the phones keypad until he managed to dial the number in his memory. He held the phone up to his ear and waiting for an answer. Lex pulled away from Chloe when his cell phone started ringing. He frowned as he checked who it was and answered it.<br>
<br>
Luthor, Lex answered.<br>
<br>
Funny, I thought that was my line, Lionel said dryly.<br>
<br>
What do you want Dad? Lex asked. Chloes eyes grew a little wider and she moved to get her purse as if to leave. Lex stopped her and shook his head. Stay, he mouthed.<br>
<br>
Now is that any way to greet your father? Lionel asked with a sneer. Especially when I have news thats relevant to your situation.<br>
<br>
And what situation would that be? Lex asked as he began to lose his patience.<br>
<br>
Were you aware that you have an audience? Lionel asked cryptically.<br>
<br>
Pardon?<br>
<br>
Your brother just called. Hes rather upset about you kissing his girlfriend, Lionel explained.<br>
<br>
Shes not his ---, Lex trailed off when he realized what his dad was saying. He looked around the Talon, but only a few other people were there and Luke wasnt one of them. Chloe looked at him quizzically and he frowned. Lex spotted Luke outside of the building and shut off his phone without saying goodbye or acknowledging his father any further. Lukes eyes met his and Luke walked to the front door. Chloe followed Lexs gaze to the front door and felt her stomach sink when she saw Luke walk in. Lex placed a reassuring hand on Chloes back. Its okay, he whispered toward her. Chloe shook her head.<br>
<br>
I should go, she said in a half-choked voice. Luke stalked toward them, his eyes on Lex the entire time.<br>
<br>
Get away from her, Luke said. He was amazed at how calm his voice sounded. Steady, yet it carried the underlying threatening tone. Ive become a Luthor, he thought to himself. He wasnt the only one. The one thought that passed through Lexs mind was how much Luke had managed to sound like their father at that exact moment. Luke glanced at Chloe. Do you see now? He wanted you for himself all along. Chloe closed her eyes and took in a deep breath. She had never wanted to run out of a room screaming so much in her entire life, but she knew the problem was never going to get any better until she confronted it. Unfortunately, that didnt make what she had to do any easier.<br>
<br>
Luke, stop it, she said. Luke furrowed his brow in confusion. Were not going out anymore, remember?<br>
<br>
So, what? Youre just going to let him seduce you into a rebound relationship? Luke asked. He shook his head and took a step toward her. It wont be like that Chloe. Hes not going to let you go.<br>
<br>
That sounds familiar, Lex mumbled under his breath.<br>
<br>
Im her *friend* Lex, Luke argued. I have every right to be concerned about her.<br>
<br>
And Im not her friend? Lex asked. Luke shook his head again and Lex looked at him in disbelief. I knew her before you did. Chloe inwardly groaned as the two men stepped closer toward each other.<br>
<br>
Theyre going to start circling like predators any minute now, she thought sarcastically. Her eyes widened when they actually did start circling each other. She cleared her throat loudly.<br>
<br>
You two obviously have some issues to work out that I have nothing to do with, so Im going to leave now, she said. Lexs face dropped. He hadnt meant to get into a fight with Luke, and certainly hadnt intended to ignore Chloe and her feelings in the process.<br>
<br>
Ill drive you home, he offered. Chloe shook her head and grabbed her oversized purse.<br>
<br>
Clark, Lana, and Pete should be getting out of the movie any minute now, she said. Ill grab a ride home with them. She looked back and forth between Lex and Luke. Give you some time to talk to your brother. She turned and walked toward the front door. Both Lex and Luke appeared stricken at the fact that she hadnt seen fit to stay and choose one of them over the other. Luke recovered first.<br>
<br>
Way to go Lex, Luke said sarcastically. Shes never going to talk to either one of us again. He walked out of the coffee shop and didnt see the smirk that crawled across Lexs mouth.<br>
<br>
Well, maybe not *you* Luke, Lex thought. But I know where shes going to be tomorrow night.<br>

<br>
And here I thought your days of drunkenness and debauchery were behind you.<br>
<br>
Lex turned his head, and barely quelled the urge to clench his hands into fists.<br>
<br>
Lucas, he greeted dryly, drawing out his full name for effect.<br>
<br>
Alexander, Luke said.  He motioned toward the vehicle that Lex had just climbed out of.  A little high-end for this part of town, isnt it?  When I saw you leaving Smallville in a limo, I assumed that you would be going somewhere *nice* in Metropolis.<br>
<br>
Is there any particular reason youve taken to stalking me?<br>
<br>
Chloes harder to follow, Lucas admitted.  I dont think she came out of her house once this morning, not even for her usual Saturday morning coffee fix at the Talon.<br>
<br>
So, this is about Chloe?  Lex asked, already knowing the answer; but not wanting to let on that Chloe was probably already inside the club rather than back in Smallville.<br>
<br>
Limo, Luke said and motioned to the car with his head.  I thought you might have picked her up without my knowing about it, and were going to show her a night on the town or something.  Luke glanced at the club and then back at Lex.  But I can see that obviously isnt the case.  What happened?  Did she turn you down and none of your old dealers would make the trip out to the boons for you to wallow in self pity?<br>
<br>
Not that its any of your business, but Im meeting an old friend.  Speaking of which, Im running late, so if youll excuse me ---,<br>
<br>
Whatever.<br>
<br>
I can get you in if you dont believe me, Lex said coolly, only hoping that Luke wouldnt call him on his bluff.  Luke threw his head back and laughed.<br>
<br>
Pass.  If Im going to spend my Saturday night getting drunk in Metropolis, then its not going to be at a place where theyre likely to drug me and harvest my organs.<br>
<br>
Youve been reading too many tabloids, Lex said with a small grin.  And youre sure?  Because Id be more than happy to arrange it.<br>
<br>
Im sure you would, Luke said, turning slightly to head back to his own car.  Try not to show up on the front page of the papers tomorrow.  He flashed his brother a cocky smile.  Or do, you know, because it can only make me look better.<br>
<br>
Your concern is touching, Lex said sarcastically.  Luke smiled again and got in his car.  Lex watched him turn the corner before heading up to the clubs front door, bypassing the long line of people who were waiting to get in.  The bouncer had his arms crossed and arched an eyebrow at him.  Lex took a picture out of his jackets inner pocket and showed it to the man.  Has she come in yet?  The large man nodded.<br>
<br>
Lucys friend, he observed.  Yeah.  They went in about a half hour ago.  The bouncer handed the picture back to Lex and shot him a look as he did so.  She said not to let you in.  Lex couldnt help smirking at the fact that Chloe had expected him to show up there.  <br>
<br>
I was never here, Lex said, the smirk still on his face as he handed the man a folded one hundred dollar bill.  The man stepped aside, allowing Lex to step into the club.  Lex frowned.  It didnt look like it had changed much in the two years since he had been there, and it really had been business that time.  The room was dark with pulsating lights and smelled of cigarette smoke, sweat, and cheap perfume.  He quickly scanned the crowd with his eyes.  Although Luke had only been joking, this really was the kind of place where someone was likely to slip something in your drink  if not to harvest your organs, then for some other nefarious reason.  He caught her bobbing up and down in the middle of the dance floor and began to head toward her.  <br>
<br>
Lex scowled at the two different men he saw approach her, one right after the other, but she was dancing alone and seemed set to keep it that way.  He couldnt hear her remarks to them, but from the dejected way they walked away from her, he could only guess.  Only his Chloe could push away drunk idiots with a few carefully chosen words.  The thought made him smile and frown at the same time.  On one hand, he was proud of her for being able to take care of herself.  Especially since Meridian wasnt exactly in a good part of town.  On the other hand, he recognized that he had just inwardly called her his even though he had no basis on which to lay claim to her.  But that wouldnt last long.  Lex managed to get behind her without her noticing and he wrapped his arms around her waist.  Chloe started to turn around.<br>
<br>
Listen jackass, I already told you --- she stopped talking and her mouth hung open slightly when she saw that Lex was the one standing there.  What are you doing here?  Lex couldnt hear her very well because of the loud music, but he was able to get the gist of what she said.  He took her hand and pulled her off the dance floor and to one of the back corners of the room.  Okay, what are you doing here?  Chloe repeated; her arms now folded defensively across her chest.<br>
<br>
You didnt really think the bouncer would keep me out just because you told him to, did you?<br>
<br>
You tipped him, Chloe said.  Lex held up a finger.<br>
<br>
I tipped him *well*, he corrected.  Ill have you know theres a considerable difference.  Chloe smiled. <br>
<br>
Im aware of that, and I should have clarified my previous question.  I thought you didnt approve of Meridian?  She noticed Lexs eyes dart around the room and then he looked back at her.<br>
<br>
I dont, he answered.  You could get really hurt in a place like this.<br>
<br>
I can take care of myself.<br>
<br>
Im sure you can, but that doesnt remove my suit of armor.<br>
<br>
Suit of armor?  Chloe asked with one eyebrow raised high in the air. <br>
<br>
The knight in shining armor bit.  I came here with every intention to rescue you from your own stubbornness.<br>
<br>
I dont need rescuing Lex.  Contrary to popular belief, I am not one of the many Smallville damsels in distress.<br>
<br>
I didnt know such a group existed.<br>
<br>
Yes you did, Chloe argued.  Its just that no one ever gave it a name before.<br>
<br>
I see.  Lex leaned closer to her and swept some hair behind her ear.  So, youre not an SDD member?  Chloe smiled at his abbreviation and then shook her head.<br>
<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
And all of those times that Clark had to rescue you from immanent peril and possibly death?  Lex countered.  Chloe smiled brightly and let her arms relax.<br>
<br>
I dont know what youre talking about, she lied.  And --- wait a second.  You came here to rescue me from me?  Just because I wanted to go dancing doesnt make me stubborn Lex.<br>
<br>
No, Lex agreed.  Im pretty sure the stubborn thing is a genetic trait that has nothing to do with dancing.  He smiled and leaned even closer to her, placing one hand tentatively on her waist.  Chloe rolled her eyes.  <br>
<br>
If youre trying to check my breath for alcohol, you can stop now.  Ive only had water.  Lex was about to speak when Chloe held up a hand.  And, before you even start, it was bottled and unopened.  Lexs lips curled into a generous grin.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
I wasnt doing it for you Lex.  You really think I want to end up in some strange guys bed with no memory of what happened to me?<br>
<br>
Well, you *are* here, Lex pointed out.  And given this clubs reputation --- he trailed off when Chloe started laughing.<br>
<br>
So, now that you know I can take care of myself, are you going to let me stay  or drag me out of here by my hair like a caveman?  She asked.  Lex seemed to think about it.<br>
<br>
The second option is tempting, he finally said.  Chloe hit his chest playfully and he smiled down at her.  But I dont think your hair is long enough for me to do that.<br>
<br>
Thank God, she said.  <br>
<br>
I could toss you over my shoulder.<br>
<br>
Please dont.<br>
<br>
Alright.  Thats not to say that Im going to let you stay here though.  That would be completely irresponsible of me.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I wish I had known you before you had a conscience, Chloe quipped.  Lexs face fell serious.<br>
<br>
You wouldnt have wanted to.  Lex still had a hand on her waist and slowly brought the other hand to rest on the other side.  He pulled her a little closer until their faces were almost touching.  I would have slept with you without giving it a second thought.  Chloe gave him a wry grin.<br>
<br>
I doubt that.<br>
<br>
Why?  Lex asked.  Chloe lightly brushed her lips against his, but pulled away immediately after doing so.<br>
<br>
First of all, youre delusional if you think I would have slept with you without being in a committed relationship.  Im not that kind of girl, you know?  <br>
<br>
I know, Lex said.  And second?  Chloe mouth spread into a Cheshire-like smile.<br>
<br>
And second, Im not that easy to forget, she said with a slight smirk.  You definitely would have given it a second thought ---  Lex closed the millimeters between them and captured her mouth with his, effectively cutting off whatever else she had been about to say.  Chloes hands crawled up his chest until they rested on his shoulders.  Their tongues darted out at the same time and Chloe let out a small moan as Lexs tongue caressed hers.  She finally pulled away to breathe and turned her eyes toward the ground so she wouldnt have to look him in the eyes.  What am I doing?  She asked herself.  This is Lex!  This is the guy who --- Lex kissed her again.  This time, their arms wove around each others bodies as they both sought more contact.  <br>
<br>
Are you sure I cant persuade you to leave?  Lex asked, his husky voice in her ear sending shivers down her spine. <br>

<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe woke up abruptly in her hotel room to the sound of her cell phone ringing next to her head.  It had been a long night and although dancing at Meridian had been so much fun, now her body just ached all over from the extreme physical activity.  She wasnt thankful at the time, but now she felt a tremendous gratitude toward Lex for coming to get her out of there early.  <br>
<br>
It took Chloe a minute to remember where she was, and what that horrible ringing sound was doing next to her head, but then she ruefully untangled herself from the sheets wrapped around her and picked up the phone.<br>
<br>
Hello?  She answered in a groggy voice and ran a hand through her wild morning hair to try and tame it.<br>
<br>
I had a feeling the phone might finally wake you up.<br>
<br>
Finally?  Chloe asked, practically sensing the smirk that she was sure was gracing Lexs face.  <br>
<br>
Ive been knocking on your door for the last five minutes.<br>
<br>
Youre not knocking now, she said with a lopsided and teasing grin.<br>
<br>
My hand got tired.  Are you going to let me in?<br>
<br>
I would, but Im not sure you could handle seeing what I look like first thing in the morning.<br>
<br>
Its eleven oclock, Chloe, Lex said in a tone that made it sound like he was surprised that she was actually still in bed.<br>
<br>
What?!  Oh, crap!  I have to ---  She trailed off when her gaze met the clock on the hotels nightstand.  I cant believe you just woke me up at eight oclock in the morning on a weekend!<br>
<br>
Lexs chuckle reverberated through the phone and Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
So, are you going to answer the door?<br>
<br>
Not now, she said.<br>
<br>
Would it help if I told you that I have a surprise for you?<br>
<br>
What kind of surprise?  Chloe asked and started walking slowly to the door.<br>
<br>
Open the door and find out.<br>
<br>
Or I could just ---  She rose on her tiptoes to stare out the peephole and then pursed her lips.  Take your hand off the peephole!   They really didnt need their cell phones now because they were just on opposite sides of the door, but both of them continued to hold the phones up to their ears.  <br>
<br>
Open the door.<br>
<br>
Chloe sighed and flipped off her phone as she moved to unlock the door.  <br>
<br>
So what if he sees me looking like this?  He cant say I didnt warn him, she thought.  She opened the door and Lex smirked at her.  His eyes drifted over her body appraisingly.  She had on a tight cami tank top with spaghetti straps and a pair of satin pajama pants.  Her hair was tousled, and Lex seriously contemplated telling her how sexy it looked.  You can be such a --- food?  She asked as she noticed the food cart next to him in the hallway.  Lex smirked again and motioned to it with his head.<br>
<br>
And coffee, but if you dont want any ---  Chloe cut him off by grabbing his arm and pulling him into the room, quickly followed by the cart full of food.  Should I take this to mean that Im forgiven?  Chloe poured some coffee into one of the cups and Lex watched her bring it up to her lips to take a sip.<br>
<br>
Do you need to be forgiven for something?<br>
<br>
Not that Im aware of, but you werent opening the door.<br>
<br>
Chloe shot him a warning glare and Lex grinned at her with a sparkle in his eyes.<br>
<br>
And I didnt even get a kiss good morning, he teased.  <br>
<br>
Chloe set her cup down and closed the small space between them.  She rose on her tiptoes as Lex leaned his head down and they kissed.  Lexs hands rested on her waist as Chloe drew him closer by wrapping her arms around his neck.  Lex ran his tongue lightly along her bottom lip, silently asking for entrance.  Chloe opened her mouth and the kiss deepened.  Just when Lex was about to give into his hormones and start backing her toward the bed, Chloe pulled away to breathe.<br>
<br>
Better?<br>
<br>
Could be, he murmured before capturing her mouth with his own again.  A guttural moan came from Chloes throat, and encouraged, Lex pulled the lower half of her body flush with his.  Chloe gasped and Lex drove his tongue deeper into her mouth.  Chloe summoned up what little strength she had and pushed herself away.<br>
<br>
We cant, she said as she took deep gulps of air.  I meant what I said last night.  I wont unless Im in a committed relationship, and technically you and I arent even going out.<br>
<br>
Were not?  Lex asked with an arched eyebrow.  Chloe sighed and ran a hair through her hair.<br>
<br>
It is *way* too early in the morning to be having this discussion without coffee in my system, she mumbled under her breath.  Lex grinned and retrieved her cup from the cart, along with a copy of The Daily Planet that the hotel had so graciously thrown in.  He could be patient for the time being.  He was willing to do whatever it took to help her completely get over his brother and move on to a relationship with him.<br>
<br>
Paper?  He asked, holding out the paper and her cup of coffee.  <br>
<br>
Chloe smiled and took both out of his hands.  She sipped her coffee and then set it down on the end table as she sat down on the side of the bed.  She promptly unfolded the paper and held it out in front of her to read the headline aloud.<br>
<br>
Five dead in multiple car collision, she said, her face falling as the words poured from her mouth.  Oh, God.  She sat down on the bed and started to read the article.  <br>
<br>
There had been a horrible accident in downtown Metropolis when some of the traffic lights malfunctioned and several people had been injured in addition to the five people who had died.  Her eyes scanned over the names that were released to the press as Lex poured himself a cup of coffee.  Lexs brow creased in concern as he watched Chloes face go pale.  Her hands started to shake and she dropped the paper.<br>
<br>
Whats wrong?<br>
<br>
Lucas.<br>
<br>
What about him?  Lex asked with a twinge of hurt and suspicion.  He didnt want his blossoming relationship to just be a rebound thing, and if his brother succeeded in winning her back, then Lex had a feeling he would never have another chance with her.<br>
<br>
Chloes eyes finally looked up from the floor at him and he could see the tears welling up in them.  Lex furrowed his brow in confusion at Chloes sudden emotional behavior, at least until he heard what she was about to say.<br>
<br>
Hes --- dead.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lionel scanned his digital reader across the print on the front page of The Daily Planet.  He loathed the mechanical voice, but he listened intently as it read through the details of the multiple car collision that had occurred in Metropolis the previous night.  Not that he had any concern for the injured, but he never knew when fate might smile upon him and wound one of his business rivals.  <br>
<br>
His mouth fell into a frown as the machine read a familiar name in the list of the deceased.  Lucas Atherton.  Lionels mind reeled at the circumstances surrounding the crash; refusing to believe that it was just an accident that his son had been killed in some random car crash. His frown turned into a purse of his lips when he remembered that Lex had gone to Metropolis the previous night as well.  <br>
<br>
You always have to take it a step too far, dont you Lex?  Lionel said to himself.  A serious and threatening expression crossed his face.  Well, something will have to be done about that.<br>
<br>

Even in his mind it sounded like a horrible thing to think, but the first thought that came to Lexs mind was that this was all some horrible rouse that his father set up to help Lucas get Chloe back.<br>
<br>
Break her heart, make her cry, show her that hes still alive and that hell be there for her --- his thought trailed off when he felt Chloe press her head against his chest.  She wasnt crying, but he could tell she was close.  His arms wrapped around her and he let one hand brush over the back of her head reassuringly.<br>
<br>
Its going to be alright, he said quietly.<br>
<br>
Is it?  Chloe asked in a choked voice.  She pulled away from him slightly and shook her head as the tears started to form in her eyes.  He tightened his arms around her and he could feel her body shake as she began to sob against him.<br>
<br>
They stood that way for quite a while; Lexs hand rubbing small, comforting circles on her back and occasionally weaving into her hair at the back of her head.  Lex closed his eyes and leaned down to kiss the top of her head.  He felt pained at the news of his brothers demise as well, but he couldnt shake the feeling that it wasnt true.<br>
<br>
Thank God for denial, quickly passed through his mind.<br>
<br>
Chloe sniffled and looked up at him with wet eyes, but the tears were beginning to go away.  Lex moved one of his hands to sweep away the last tear that was trailing down her cheek, but kept his palm against her face and gently cupped her jaw.  Their eyes locked and, as if in slow motion, he lowered his mouth to hers.  It remained a sweet, soft kiss for a few seconds, but gradually their lips started pressing harder and harder against each other  opening to each other and allowing their tongues to play in an erotic dance.<br>
<br>
Somewhere in the very back of Chloes mind, she knew what they were doing was wrong.  She had a feeling that Lex knew it too, but neither one of them made a move to stop it.  She was upset and she could only imagine how much worse Lex must feel since he had just lost his brother; so, if a little  comforting  helped to get their minds off what they had just found out, then so be it.  Chloe forced back her sorrow over Lukes death and ran her hands over Lexs back, tugging at the bottom hem of his shirt to untuck it.  Lex let out a light groan and slid his hands down her back to remove her shirt as well.  Their lips brushed against each others again, but only for a split second before Lex moved his lips to her ear.<br>
<br>
Promise me you wont go back to him, he said in a low and almost pleading voice.  Chloe tried to pull away from him, realizing that Lucass death hadnt sunk in with him yet.  Lex tightened his grip on her and stared into her eyes.<br>
<br>
Lex ---<br>
<br>
Promise me, he repeated.  The look in his eyes made Chloes heart start to beat harder and she could only summon up a partial nod of her head before Lex kissed her again.  The next few minutes were frenzied as their mouths moved together and the rest of their clothing was removed.  Chloes brain only barely registered the fact that she was being backed toward the bed, but a strong arousal swept through her and settled between her legs as Lex slowly lay her down on it.<br>
<br>
A throaty moan escaped her lips as he took the supple skin of her neck into his mouth and trailed his hand up her body to tease her breast. Chloes body immediately arched into his touch seeking, needing more.  His lips peppered kisses down her neck to her collarbone and then to her breasts.  Chloe let out a whimpering sound when she felt his warm, moist tongue tracing circles on her nipple.  She absently started to roll her hips against him, seeking the friction that her body had started demanding.<br>
<br>
Lex, she moaned out.  The sensations overtaking her body were too much and she started digging her fingernails into his back.  Lex gave her one last kiss before hovering above her and positioning himself between her thighs.  The feel of her wet heat surrounding him almost undid him when he started to slowly move his cock inside her.  Chloe gasped in pain as he pulled back slightly and then thrust into her completely, breaking through her innocence.  She pushed aside whatever thoughts came to mind about why she shouldnt be doing this, and how she should have told him; because it was too late now.  She didnt want to stop; she needed this sensation, this pleasure, this distraction from the emotional pain she was trying to bury.  He pumped into her and she began to grind her hips into him as she matched his rhythm.<br>
<br>
He grunted and she moaned every time he hit her core.  Chloe felt a warm tingle spread through her body and her hands dug harder into his skin as she ran them haphazardly over his shoulders and back.  Lex felt Chloes inner walls begin to clamp around him and he knew she was close.  Only one more thing  he reached down between there bodies and rubbed her clit with his thumb.  The action sent Chloes sensations spinning out of control.  Her vision glazed into a white light and her body started to quake beneath him.<br>
<br>
Lex thrust in one more time as he called out her name and then collapsed on top of her.  His breathing was ragged and his body was spent from their passionate coupling.  He buried his face in the crook of her neck and let his lips lazily run along the small area of skin.  Chloe ran her hand over the back of his smooth scalp, bringing his face toward her to kiss again.  They lightly nipped at each others mouths until Chloe just let her head fall back against the bed and closed her eyes as she tried to catch her breath.<br>
<br>
The phone rang and Chloe and Lex both turned their heads toward the sound, but neither made a move to answer it.  Chloe felt Lexs warm breath at her ear again.<br>
<br>
You should get it, he said, the tone of his voice not really agreeing with the words he was speaking.<br>
<br>
I should, she said numbly.  It rang another four times before Chloe gave in and Lex rolled off her so she could reach for the phone.  Hello?<br>
<br>
Did I wake you?  Gabe asked on the other end of the line.<br>
<br>
No, she said.  Gabe mistook her raspy and breathless tone when she answered to mean that she had been crying and he inwardly cringed at the pain that his daughter must be going through.<br>
<br>
So, I guess youve seen the morning paper, huh?  He asked cautiously.<br>
<br>
Yeah, was all she could say in response.<br>
<br>
Oh, Chloe, Gabe said on the other end of the line, Im so sorry.  I just read.  Chloe let her eyes fall closed again, trying to will the tears forming in her eyes not to fall.  Listen, honey, I know that you probably want some time to yourself, but I really think it would be better if you were around other people right now.  How about you let your old man take you out for breakfast?<br>
<br>
Chloe looked over at the cart of uneaten food and then over at Lex.<br>
<br>
I  I already ordered room service, she lied.  Gabe frowned and at her choked voice.<br>
<br>
Chloe ---<br>
<br>
Im not trying to avoid you, Dad.  I  um  I need a little bit of time.  Let me eat and take a shower and then I can go with you to the restaurant and watch you eat breakfast.<br>
<br>
Gee, that sounds fun, Gabe said sarcastically.<br>
<br>
Dad, she said warningly.<br>
<br>
Alright, he agreed.  I suppose thats the best Im going to get.  He let out a small sigh and shook his head lightly at his daughters stubbornness.  When do you want to meet?<br>
<br>
Give me a half hour, she said.  And then Ill meet you at your room.  Gabe nodded, even though Chloe couldnt see it.<br>
<br>
Sounds good, he said.  See you then.<br>
<br>
Bye.<br>
<br>
Chloe placed the phone back on its hook and then lay back against the bed.  Lex moved over beside her and gently let his fingertips drift along her hip and then her stomach.<br>
<br>
How are you doing?<br>
<br>
Fine, she lied.  Chloe forced a small grin onto her lips and then pushed herself up to a sitting position.  I should get ready.  Lex nodded in agreement.  He hadnt expected her to be happy about what had just happened between them  especially not after she got some time to think about it.  He had basically taken advantage of both of their emotional states by initiating and following through with something he had wanted for a long time, and he couldnt blame her if she never wanted to see him again.  The sad thing was that this time it wouldnt be anyones fault but his.  He pursed his lips ever so slightly when she turned her eyes away from him and slid off the bed.  He didnt want to lose her.<br>
<br>
Chloe, he said, sitting up and reaching his arm out to grab onto her wrist.  She turned around and looked at him with an almost sad expression on her face.  She didnt regret what they had just done, but she thought he might.<br>
<br>
Its okay, Lex, she said.  I know you just got carried away because of everything that happened, and  you dont have to say anything.  In one swift movement, Lex was standing next to her, his hands firmly on her hips as he kissed her.  When he finally let her pull away to breathe, she stared up at him in surprise.  Lex felt his heart beating faster and harder underneath his ribs.  He had never told any woman this and with everything that had happened, he had a feeling that Chloe might be more likely to be scared away than to run into his arms.  He took a deep breath and made solid eye contact with her.<br>
<br>
Chloe, I love you.<br>
<br>
Chloe blinked a couple of times, not really sure that she had heard what she thought she heard.<br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
One corner of Lexs mouth turned upward in a lopsided grin.<br>
<br>
I love you, he repeated.  Chloes mouth dropped open slightly, but quickly closed.<br>
<br>
I ---<br>
<br>
He kissed her again, but this time it was quickly.<br>
<br>
You have to meet your dad, he reminded her.  Youd better get ready.  She furrowed her brow a little in confusion but then nodded.<br>
<br>
Chloe walked into the bathroom and Lex watched her close the door behind her.  For some reason, he felt confident.  She might not love him yet, but she would soon.<br>
<br>
And now that Lucas is out of the way --- Lexs own thoughts trailed off and marred his face with a half-scowl as he picked up the paper and sat down on the bed.  Despite the fact that he had no physical evidence, Lex couldnt shake his gut feeling that Lucas wasnt dead.  He moved his arm as he repositioned his body to get more comfortable, but immediately lifted it back up to look at it when he felt a wet, sticky substance underneath his hand.  His eyes grew wide when he looked down at the mixture of blood and discharge on his hand and on the sheets.  Lex brought his free hand up and ran it down his face.  Fuck.<br>

<br>
Chloe? Lex asked as he lightly rapped on the bathroom door.  She didnt answer and he frowned, reaching out with his hand to test the doorknob.  He let his frown fade into a neutral expression when he saw that she hadnt locked it.  Chloe? he asked again as he started to open the door.  The water for the bath was almost running over the side of the tub, but Chloe wasnt in the bathtub.<br>
<br>
Lexs heart constricted when he saw her sitting against the wall.  Her knees were tucked up to her chest and her face was buried against them.  Lex could hear her softly sobbing, but he walked over to turn off the bathtubs faucet before moving over to her.  He slid against the wall so he could sit down next to her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders as Chloe leaned her body against his.<br>
<br>
Lex let her cry in silence for what seemed like an eternity, knowing that there werent any words he could say to make her feel better about what was going on.  Now definitely wasnt the time to bring up that she hadnt told him that she had been a virgin up until that morning or how sorry he was for taking advantage of both of their emotional states.<br>
<br>
Chloe finally raised her head, but kept her gaze facing straight ahead.<br>
<br>
How are you doing? Lex asked, stroking her hair absently with his upraised hand.  Chloe sniffled and nodded.<br>
<br>
A little better, she answered quietly.  She paused and let out a sad chuckle while she wiped the tears from her face.  My dad probably thinks I drowned in the tub by now.  Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
Im sure he understands, he said.  A knock came at the rooms front door and Lexs grin lifted higher.  Or not.  Chloe gave him a brief smile.<br>
<br>
Could you toss me some of my clothes so I can get dressed?<br>
<br>
Sure.  You want me to get the door?<br>
<br>
Chloe grimaced and Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
Dont worry.  Ill just tell him I read the article and knew you were in town, so --- he trailed off when she nodded.<br>
<br>
Good idea.  Thanks, she said.  Lex nodded once and went to retrieve some clothing for her.  He saw that she had hung up a dress on the hotels coat rack, so he grabbed that and some undergarments from one of her bags.  He held them out for her and the knocking at the front door became louder and more persistent.  Lex sighed and walked to the front door after closing the bathroom door behind him.<br>
<br>
As simple as the idea of lying to Gabe sounded, he knew in reality, it would be much more difficult.  For one thing, even though the smell of his and Chloes coupling had mixed with the smell of the food from the breakfast tray, it was still distinguishable, especially to someone who knew the scent of sex.  For another, Gabe always seemed to be able to tell when he was lying.  He didnt generally call him on it, but Lex knew that he could tell.<br>
<br>
Lex, thinking that it could only be Gabe at the door, made the mistake of unlatching the lock and opening the door without checking to see who it was through the peephole.  He was startled to see two masked men dressed in black, but he didnt get the chance to yell for Chloe to protect herself, because one of the men shot him with a tranquilizer gun immediately.  The dart pierced Lexs skin and his limp body fell to the floor, making a thumping sound as it hit the carpet.  The second man scanned the room with his eyes and motioned to the bathroom door with his head.<br>
<br>
The man who shot Lex nodded and lightly knocked on the door, positioning himself to shoot Chloe as she opened it.<br>
<br>
Hold on! she yelled from the other side.  The man looked questioningly at his partner, silently asking whether he should break the door down or not.  His partner shook his head.  This was supposed to be a simple operation and they had already made too much noise by knocking loudly on the bedroom door.  If they broke down the bathroom door, the action itself would make a loud enough noise to alert the neighbors, let alone the inevitable scream that Chloe would let out.  Okay, Im ready, Chloe said as she opened the door.  Her eyes were looking downward as she smoothed out her dress with her hands and the man positioned by the door shot her with the tranquilizer gun before she even got a chance to look up.<br>
<br>
He caught her as her body started to fall and hefted her over his shoulder.  He briefly looked down at Lexs body on the floor.  They hadnt been told that she would have company, but had come prepared for the possibility anyway.<br>
<br>
Leave him, his partner said.  The man carrying Chloe nodded and the two left the room, closing the door behind them.<br>
<br>
A couple of hours later, Gabe stood in front of Chloes room with the hotel manager, Jackie Barnes.<br>
<br>
Youre sure you want me to do this?  I mean, she could have just overslept, the woman said, trying to reason with him.  Gabe shook his head.<br>
<br>
I spoke to her two and a half hours ago, and she wasnt sleeping.  Gabe closed his eyes for a second and then stared down at her.  Her ex-boyfriend was one of the casualties in that car accident last night.  I  I dont think shes taking the news well.  Understanding swept over Jackies face and she nodded.<br>
<br>
Okay.  She knocked on the door, readying herself to having to use her key if necessary.  Miss Sullivan?  Its Jackie Barnes, the hotel manager.  Id like you to open the door please.  There was no answer and Jackie got a twisting feeling in her gut.  The girls father had been right.  Something was very wrong.  She just hoped that she wouldnt open the door to find that Chloe had killed herself.  That was the last thing anyone needed to see, let alone the girls own father.<br>
<br>
She slid the card key into place and opened the door slowly.<br>
<br>
Miss Sullivan? she called out again.  The room was humid, as if someone had been in the shower or bath for a long time and the water had permeated the air.  The humidity mixed with the smell of food and sex and the woman frowned as she stepped into the room.  Perhaps Chloe had just decided to wallow in her sorrow in some other manner.  She caught a glimpse of the bed, unmade and the sheets and comforter looked like they had been well tossed.  Her foot bumped into Lexs body, causing her to look down.<br>
<br>
Her eyes grew wide when she saw the tranquilizer dart sticking out of the young mans neck and her mouth dropped open into a gasp when she realized who the unconscious man was.  She covered her mouth with her hand and took a few steps backward, running straight into Gabe.  He followed her gaze down to Lexs body and cringed ever so slightly.<br>
<br>
Its Lex Luthor, Jackie said in almost a whisper.  Why would he be ---?<br>
<br>
Hes a friend of my daughters, Gabe said, cutting her off.  He didnt really feel like explaining the whole story to her of Chloes ex-boyfriend being Lexs half-brother or the fact that he worked for Lex himself.  He figured that Lex had read the article too and knowing that Chloe was in town with him, had tracked her down to comfort her.  He didnt smell anything in the room because he had a slight cold, so he didnt automatically jump to the conclusion that Lex might have feelings for Chloe other than friendship.  Gabe moved past Jackie and squatted down beside Lex, plucking the dart out of his neck and shaking his shoulder to try to wake him up.<br>
<br>
Lex, he said, but there was no response.  Lex! he said louder, shaking the body even harder.  Lexs eyes groggily fluttered open and he squinted as he tried to make out the figure that was calling out his name.<br>
<br>
Gabe?<br>
<br>
Yeah, its me, Gabe said, holding out a hand to help him up to a sitting position.  What happened?<br>
<br>
Lex closed his eyes as he tried to remember, but they shot open the second that the picture of the two masked men appeared in his mind.<br>
<br>
Fuck!  Wheres Chloe?  Is she okay?<br>
<br>
I was going to ask you the same question, Gabe said.  Do you remember what happened?<br>
<br>
Shes not here? Lex asked in a panicked voice.  Gabe shook his head.<br>
<br>
We havent checked the bathroom yet, Jackie chimed in.  Both the men shot her a look and she gave them an uneasy grin.  And, Ill just go do that now, she said under her breath.<br>
<br>
Two men.  They came to the door.  I didnt check to see who it was because I thought you were coming to pick up Chloe for breakfast, Lex rambled.<br>
<br>
You were here because you found out that your brother died? Gabe asked sympathetically.  Lex, still under the tranquilizers affects, shook his head.<br>
<br>
I brought her breakfast, he said, not even paying attention to the person he was speaking to.  Gabe looked at him questioningly, but Lex looked straight ahead as he shakily pushed himself up to a standing position.  Gabe rose to his feet as well, tilting his head at Lex as a sign to continue.  Something in Lexs mind clicked into place and he realized that he needed to come up with a cover story fast.<br>
<br>
Shes not in there, Jackie interrupted as she came out of the bathroom.  Gabe barely glanced at her before concentrating his attention on Lex again.<br>
<br>
Luke followed me to Metropolis last night.  I wanted to make sure she was alright.  Gabe nodded.  That made sense.  Lex had been protective of Chloe ever since Luke had started acting strangely.<br>
<br>
So, there were two men? Gabe asked in an attempt to bring the conversation back to where Chloe might be.  Would you be able to describe them?  Lex shook his head.<br>
<br>
They were wearing masks, Lex said.  He closed his eyes again as a wave of dizziness bombarded him.  He staggered over to one of the chairs, sat down, and buried his face in his hands.  Oh, God, he mumbled, running his hands over his face before he looked at Gabe.  Hes got her.<br>
<br>
Whos got her? Jackie asked.  Lex didnt even bother to look over at her.<br>
<br>
My father, he said quietly.  Gabe frowned.<br>
<br>
Why would your dad take Chloe? he asked.  Lex frowned back at him.<br>
<br>
Who knows?  He probably blames her for Lukes death, Lex answered.  Because everything was just perfect with his long-lost son until Chloe dumped him.  Lex looked over at Jackie, who seemed in shock about the entire situation.  Go call the police, he ordered.  She absently nodded and left the room and Gabe took the chair across from Lexs.  God, this is all my fault.<br>
<br>
Is he going to hurt her? Gabe asked quietly.  Lex looked over at him and Gabe caught his eyes.  He looked sad, remorseful, and like his heart was ready to break in half.  Gabe also noted the fire that sprung up in Lexs eyes.<br>
<br>
Ill get her back.<br>
<br>
Thats not what I asked you, Gabe pointed out, trying to ignore the possessive quality that came through in Lexs voice.<br>
<br>
Ill get her back.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe awoke later that day to find herself lying down on a bed in an unknown room.  She sleepily tried to raise herself up from her position, only to find that one of her wrists was handcuffed to the headboard.  She furrowed her brow as she tried to remember what happened, but was snapped out of her thoughts when a familiar voice came to stand beside her.<br>
<br>
Hey, sweetheart.  Miss me?<br>

Where is she?!<br>
<br>
Lionels head turned toward the sound of Lexs growl.<br>
<br>
I presume you mean Miss Sullivan? Lionel asked calmly and somewhat smugly.  <br>
<br>
He was taken by surprise when Lex shoved him against the wall, tipping over the decanter set which stood in the way.  If Lexs physical action hadnt been enough, the sound of glass breaking and the liquid running from the containers was more than enough to convince Lionel that Lex was very serious and he shouldnt treat whatever it was that Lex was upset about with only trivial concern.<br>
<br>
Where  is  she? Lex asked, annunciating each word with a progressive threatening tone.  <br>
<br>
I dont know what youre talking about, Lionel said, trying to remove Lexs hands from where they were clenching his shirt and jacket.  He failed.  Lex gave him another push, slamming his head back hard against the wall.<br>
<br>
I dont have time for your stupid games.  I was attacked by two men with a tranquilizer gun and when I woke up, Chloe had been taken.  The police are already looking for her, and Ive put up a reward for information as to her whereabouts.  Now - what have you done with Chloe?!<br>
<br>
Lex ---<br>
<br>
I let you live once, Lex interrupted, it wont happen again.<br>
<br>
I dont have any idea where your girlfriend is, Lex, Lionel answered.  Lex narrowed his eyes at him and shook his head slightly, because it almost sounded like he was telling the truth.  In fact, if he hadnt been raised to be suspicious of everything that came out of Lionels mouth, then he would have believed him.  She *is* your girlfriend now, isnt she?<br>
<br>
Yes, Lex answered without hesitation.  <br>
<br>
Yes, Lionel repeated, his tone becoming menacing.  Of course she is - now that youve eliminated your competition.<br>
<br>
You think I killed Luke?<br>
<br>
No.  I think you were raised well enough to know how to keep your hands clean, Lionel answered.  And there *will* be retribution.<br>
<br>
But you think I had something to do with it, Lex stated as a fact and not a question.<br>
<br>
Didnt you?<br>
<br>
Im not a monster, Dad.  Not like you, Lex said.  Lionel scoffed.<br>
<br>
You stole the only thing in this world that my son cared about.  What would *you* call yourself?<br>
<br>
A friend.  He needed help  psychiatric help.  If you had let me get it for him in the first place ---<br>
<br>
He seemed to be doing just fine  straight A student, on several sports teams, popular - until he saw that his own brother wanted the one thing he desired most.  Can you really blame him for hiding her away from you?<br>
<br>
First of all, Chloe is not a thing, Lex said, keeping his face uncomfortably close to his fathers.  *That* was the problem.  Shes a human being and Luke viewed her as a possession.<br>
<br>
And second?<br>
<br>
And second  of course I can blame him for hiding her.  He was trying to make her completely dependent on him, alienating her from the people who really care about her.  Lex paused and straightened his posture.  His dad was entirely too good at getting him riled up and forgetting what the original topic of argument was about, but he wasnt going to allow that this time.  Ive answered your questions, you answer mine.  Where is she?<br>
<br>
I know you dont want to believe me, but I didnt do anything to her.<br>
<br>
That wasnt what I asked, Lex said in an ominous tone.  For once, Lionel was at a loss for words.  Lex didnt believe the truth and Lionel knew from the anger lacing his words that his son was fully prepared to carry through on the threat he had just issued minutes before. <br>
<br>
Lex  I didnt ---<br>
<br>
You honestly expect me to believe that you didnt take her?  That you wouldnt seek any kind of vengeance for your sons death?  I know you better than that.<br>
<br>
I didnt say there wouldnt be consequences for your actions, Lex; but taking Miss Sullivan wasnt my doing.  I --- Lionels plea was cut off by the sound of the office phone ringing.  Lex took a step back and allowed his father to move forward.<br>
<br>
Put it on speaker, Lex curtly demanded.  Lionel pursed his lips and felt his blood start to boil.  Lex had the upper hand, but he wasnt about to go down without a fight.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you should be the one to answer it, Lionel suggested.  That way youll know for certain that Im not trying to lie to you.  <br>
<br>
Youre *always* trying to lie to me, Lex retorted.  But then again, his dad had a point.  Lex squared his jaw and took the few steps he needed to take in order to get to the phone.  He picked up and spoke gruffly into the receiver, keeping his eyes on Lionel the entire time.  Lex Luthor.<br>
<br>
Its Michael Atherton, the mans voice on the other end of the line greeted angrily.  I need to speak with Lionel.<br>
<br>
Hes not available, but Ill tell him you called, Lex said tersely.  He was having a hard enough time dealing with Chloes kidnapping and Lukes death to add a conversation with his brothers adoptive father into the mix.<br>
<br>
Tell him that I know he was behind this and he wont get away with it, Michael said.  Ill find out where he took my son.  Lexs outward expression showed none of the confusion he felt with Michaels statement, but inside his mind was reeling.  <br>
<br>
Luke is dead, Mr. Atherton.  He ---<br>
<br>
His drivers license was on one of the dead bodies, but its sure as hell not him thats lying in the morgue right now.<br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
They needed me to identify the body, because Coast City issues drivers licenses without a picture on them, Michael said.  But I just saw the body  and thats not my kid, Michael said with a growl.  Lexs face paled, only leaving a dash of color in his cheeks.  If Luke wasnt dead and Lionel said he didnt have anything to do with Chloes kidnapping. . .<br>
<br>
Ill tell him, Lex said quickly and hung up the phone without a proper goodbye.  His eyes turned upon Lionel again.  Allow me to rephrase my earlier question: where is Luke?<br>
<br>
The Metropolis morgue I presume.  Luke is dead.  You know that as well as I do, Lionel said, a touch of sadness creeping into his voice.<br>
<br>
His father disagrees.<br>
<br>
*Im* his father, Lionel sneered.  Lex squared his jaw.<br>
<br>
Thats becoming more and more obvious, he said under his breath.  What was your plan?  Have him fake his death, let him kidnap Chloe, give him enough money to live happily ever after under a new identity?<br>
<br>
What are you ---?<br>
<br>
The body the police found wasnt Lukes.  They only assumed it was him because his drivers license didnt have a picture on it, Lex explained.  He couldnt help but notice how relieved and almost happy his dad appeared after receiving the information and he shook his head.  No.  I *know* you had something to do with this.  It couldnt have just been him.  Theres no way he could have pulled this off on his own.<br>
<br>
Need I remind you that Lucas has been recorded as having a genius-level IQ? Lionel asked.  <br>
<br>
I dont care if hes the smartest man in the world  he couldnt have taken her without having the resources to do so.  And seeing as how Mr. Atherton was demanding to know where his son was, Im going to go out on a limb and say that he wasnt the one to provide him with the money.  Lex paused when he heard his father grumble something under his breath.  What was that?<br>
<br>
Nothing, Lionel lied.  Now, if were done here ---<br>
<br>
Were not, Lex stated and strode over to where Lionel was standing once again.  Youre going to tell me everything you know, and youre going to tell me now.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
--- And then I was thinking the Caymans.  Theyre really beautiful this time of year, Luke said as he sat next to Chloe, stroking her hair.  <br>
<br>
She had become quite adamant about him releasing her when she first woke up, but not strong enough physically to do anything about it yet because of the lasting effects of the tranquilizer, so he sat her down and had tied her arms behind her and her legs to the chair.  Once the gag had been placed in her mouth, Luke had crossed the line between creepy and completely psychotic.  He started talking to her like they were lovers making plans for the future, like nothing had ever been wrong between them, like her sitting there bound and gagged was entirely normal.  Chloe made some sounds of protest and Luke just smiled at her.<br>
<br>
And you want to know what the best part of it is?  Its all on dear old dad.<br>
<br>
Chloe shot him a half-questioning, half-horrified look and Luke continued.<br>
<br>
Did you know that he gave me a rather sizeable amount of money to try and make me forget about you? Luke shook his head and let out a small sigh.  But I could never forget about you.  We belong together.<br>

<br>
Whats to know?  The reward is more than what we were paid for the job in the first place.<br>
<br>
Yeah, but the guy is a complete psycho.<br>
<br>
All the more reason to put him behind bars - and we get some money at the same time.<br>
<br>
What if shes not there anymore?  What if hes already gotten rid of her?<br>
<br>
Yeah, right.  Did you see the way he was doting on her?<br>
<br>
Yeah, okay.  Im in.  Just remember to have him transfer the money to the numbered account instead of giving him our names.<br>
<br>
What am I  an idiot?<br>
<br>
Well ---<br>
<br>
I already told you, it said no questions asked.  Theyre not looking for us.  They just want the chick back.<br>
<br>
I dont know.  It could be a set-up.<br>
<br>
Youre just pissed cuz I didnt let you have her before we turned her over to the guy.<br>
<br>
Yeah  why was that anyway?<br>
<br>
With that guy?  Like you said, *psycho*.  You think he wouldnt have noticed that you deflowered his virginal bride?<br>
<br>
No way was she a virgin, man.  That other guy was in her hotel room.<br>
<br>
Hmm  good point.  Sorry, man.  Next time, okay?<br>
<br>
The man clicked on the prepaid cell phone and dialed the number that had flashed on the television screen only moments earlier, pacing impatiently as it rang.<br>
<br>
Metropolis Missing Hotline, a womans voice greeted from the other end of the phone.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I have some information on Chloe Sullivan.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lex paced angrily in his office.  His dad had given Lucas the money with the ridiculous string of having him forget about Chloe and moving on with his life.  Every step Lex took, the more livid he got.  Surely Lionel must have known that Lucas wouldnt give up Chloe just for money  not when he was that obsessed; but maybe that was his fathers plan all along; give Lucas the money, knowing that he would try and take Chloe with it, and disappear. <br>
<br>
Leaving me here with a broken heart so I could turn to him and form the partnership that he wants, Lex thought.  Damn it!  He picked up a paperweight from his desk and flung it at the wall.  Bastard!<br>
<br>
He whipped his head around at the sound of his phone ringing and hurriedly grabbed the receiver off the hook.<br>
<br>
Luthor, he answered gruffly.<br>
<br>
Mr. Luthor, a voice came through the line, this is Captain Sanborn.  I have some good news and some bad news for you.<br>
<br>
Idiot.  Just tell me, Lex thought.  And?<br>
<br>
The good news is: weve found Miss Sullivan.<br>
<br>
When?<br>
<br>
Not ten minutes ago.  We got a tip leading us to her and a Lucas Atherton  the real one apparently, not the guy listed in the paper.<br>
<br>
Why didnt you tell me about the tip? Lex snapped into the phone.  I was supposed to be ---<br>
<br>
Even with your resources, theres no way you could have gotten to Metropolis in time, the captain interjected.  Besides, we got her.  Thats the important thing.  Lex let out a breath and rubbed his eyes with his free hand.  <br>
<br>
How is she?<br>
<br>
Well, therein lies the bad news, he answered.  Or part of it anyway.  She seems pretty shaken up by the whole ordeal.<br>
<br>
Thats understandable.<br>
<br>
Um --- the man paused, making Lex wish he could hit him through the phone, shes on her way to Metropolis General.  Theyre going to do a rape kit.  Lexs stomach sank with the information, but his momentary lapse into nausea was quickly replaced by seething anger.<br>
<br>
He raped her? Lex growled into the phone.<br>
<br>
Uh  we dont know yet.  Thats why theyre doing the kit, he answered.  Captain Sanborn heard cursing and something being thrown and broken in the background and he cringed.  Lex Luthor was known for having a temper and he absently wondered if they would be able to keep the Sullivan girls attacker alive long enough for him to go to trial.<br>
<br>
You said that was part of the bad news  whats the rest of it? Lex asked, clutching the phone in his hand as he tried to calm down.  His nostrils were already flaring with every deep breath he took and the next person who showed up in the room was likely to be on the receiving end of a blow to the head, but he needed to regain some composure when speaking with the man on the other end of the phone.  He would never get in to see Chloe if he didnt.<br>
<br>
Oh, right, the captain said, his tone indicating that he had clearly forgotten about it.  The guys who tipped us off  they gave a numbered account for the deposit of the reward.<br>
<br>
So?<br>
<br>
Well, they were claiming to work in that neighborhood, and nobody legit who works there would have a numbered account.<br>
<br>
Its most likely that they were the men Luke hired, Lex said, practically reading Sanborns mind.<br>
<br>
Yeah, thats what we think.  So, were going to try and track them down, but ---<br>
<br>
Whats the number?<br>
<br>
Pardon?<br>
<br>
The number for the account they gave you, Lex clarified somewhat shortly.  Ill have the funds transferred.<br>
<br>
Mr. Luthor, I dont think you understand.  These men ---<br>
<br>
Those men, Lex interrupted, told you where to find Chloe, which Im fairly certain you wouldnt have been able to figure out yourself, at least not in time.  The reward I offered said no questions and I meant it.  Now, give me the number.<br>
<br>
Lex waited impatiently as Sanborn got the number from someone back at the station and then quickly jotted it down as it was read to him.<br>
<br>
No offense, Mr. Luthor, but are you sure you want to do this?  I mean, we could get them locked away too.<br>
<br>
Im sure.  Do you know what room Chloe will be taken to?<br>
<br>
Just emergency I think, he answered.  You want her transferred to a special room?<br>
<br>
Yes.  Call the hospital and have a private room set up for her.  Im on my way.<br>
<br>
Mr. Luthor, I --- he trailed off when he heard the distinct sound of a click and then a dial tone ring in his ear.  Rich people.<br>
<br>
 ~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Gabe stood before the door to Chloes hospital room and took a deep breath to steady himself.  As if going through everything she had gone through during her relationship with Luke wasnt traumatic enough, but then the boy had kidnapped her and possibly raped her.  <br>
<br>
You want me to go first? Lex asked quietly.  Gabe turned his head to look at the young man to his side.  <br>
<br>
From Lexs behavior after Chloe was taken, he had managed to put the pieces together as to what Lexs true feelings for his daughter were; and surprisingly enough, Lex hadnt denied it when he had confronted him.  Gabe couldnt say that he was completely alright with the idea that his boss had feelings for Chloe, but he knew from the way Lex had treated her during their period of friendship that he would never hurt her  and God help the person who ever tried to.  He finally shook his head lightly at Lex.<br>
<br>
No, he said.  Ive got it.  Let me see how she is before --- Lex gave him a nod of his head in understanding and Gabe turned back around to place his hand on the door handle.<br>
<br>
He slowly peeked in and to his surprise, saw Chloe flipping through the stations on the TV with the small remote in her hand.  He gave her a glimpse of a grin when her head turned and caught him looking in on her.<br>
<br>
Hey, he said.  Feeling up to a visit from your old man?  Chloe let out a light chuckle and smiled back at him.<br>
<br>
I guess so, she said mockingly; making it sound like it was a huge chore.  Gabe walked in the room and shut the door behind him.<br>
<br>
So --- he said, but trailed off as he shoved his hands in his pockets.<br>
<br>
Im fine, she said reassuringly.  Gabe frowned, not believing her, and she rolled her eyes.  Dad, Ive been buried alive, thrown out a window, invaded by an alien parasite  Im fine - *really*.  <br>
<br>
Sweetheart, you dont have to pretend to be strong for me, he said in a comforting voice, walking slowly to her bedside.  <br>
<br>
Daddy, Im *fine*.  A little creeped out, she said and tilted her head to the side, okay, a *lot* creeped out, but Im okay.  She smiled jokingly at him.  Nothing that years of therapy wont sort out.  Gabe let out a humorless laugh.<br>
<br>
Yeah.  Maybe we can go together, he said and sat down in the chair next to her bed.  They said you might have been ---<br>
<br>
I wasnt, Chloe said surely.  The rape kit came back negative.  Gabe watched Chloes face go into lockdown mode, meaning that she wasnt telling him everything, and he had a suspicion that he knew what it was.<br>
<br>
I know about you and Lex, he said.  Chloes eyes grew a little wider and she desperately racked her brain trying to come up with a believable lie. <br>
<br>
I ---<br>
<br>
I know that you have feelings for each other, Gabe continued, not noticing when Chloe let out a breath of relief.  I cant say that I was too happy when I figured it out, but at least I know hell never hurt you.  He reached over and placed his hand over Chloes hand.  And that he wont let anyone else hurt you  not again anyway.<br>
<br>
Dad, I ---<br>
<br>
Chloe, Gabe started again, only in a hushed voice.  I dont think its just a passing thing for him.  I think he loves you.  So  if youre just on the rebound or whatever, you should let him know now.  Okay?  Chloe blinked a couple of times in surprise and then nodded.  Good, Gabe said and gave her hand a pat before standing up.  Now that Ive said my two cents, you think you can handle talking to him?  Chloe nodded again.  Ill send him in.<br>

Hey, Chloe greeted quietly.  Lex gave her the barest hint of a grin as he shut the door behind him.<br>
<br>
Hey.  How are you feeling? he asked, moving toward the side of her bed slowly.  She shrugged.<br>
<br>
As good as can be expected, she answered.  He nodded, but said nothing.  So-oo ---<br>
<br>
God, Chloe.  You have no idea how sorry I am, he said, taking a few more steps toward her, but then catching himself and stopping before he over-stepped his bounds.  Chloe frowned.<br>
<br>
Lex  you do realize that none of this was your fault, dont you? she asked.  This was what she had been afraid of.  She knew that he had a tendency to place the blame for other peoples actions on himself and it drove her crazy.  Lex shook his head.<br>
<br>
Youre wrong.  If I had --- he trailed off when he saw the bemused expression take over Chloes face.  What?<br>
<br>
Youre arguing with me, when *Im* the one in the hospital? she asked.<br>
<br>
I ---<br>
<br>
A place where I dont actually need to be, by the way; especially now that I know for sure that he didnt rape me, Chloe added and then smiled at him.  Not that I dont appreciate the private room, because I dont know if I would be able to handle another patient asking me a ton of questions about why I was here and having no way to escape.<br>
<br>
Lex grinned at her rambling and then closed the remaining space between them to sit down in the chair next to her bed.  He clasped his hands together as he leaned toward her.<br>
<br>
There are some things we need to talk about.<br>
<br>
Chloe let out a small sigh and then closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
Cant say that you didnt see this one coming, Sullivan, she mumbled quietly to herself.  Okay, get on with it.  <br>
<br>
When she opened her eyes, her gaze was focused on the blanket that covered her legs.  Lex creased his brow in confusion at her words, and when he saw her fingering the material instead of looking at him, the pieces clicked together.<br>
<br>
Chloe?  Look at me, he ordered softly.  <br>
<br>
Chloe turned her head to look at him as he requested and Lex reached out to brush a single tear off her cheek with his thumb.  Chloe flinched with the motion and tried to turn her face away.<br>
<br>
Dont, she practically whispered.  Lex felt his heart constrict in pain at her reaction and wanted to kill his half-brother even more than he already did.<br>
<br>
Chloe, I ---<br>
<br>
Just dont.  Okay? she pleaded, her voice choked with unshed tears.  You want to tell me it was a mistake?  Fine.  But dont go ---<br>
<br>
Lex moved swiftly; so much so that Chloe didnt see him rise from his chair and cover her mouth with his own until it was too late.  She sank into the kiss, her hands lifting to his shoulders as it became more passionate.  When they finally pulled away to breathe, she looked at him with confusion marring her features.<br>
<br>
I love you, Lex reminded her.  I would never call whats happened between us a mistake.  He paused for a second and grinned at her.  Except for letting you see Luke for so long, he clarified.<br>
<br>
There was no way you could have known, Chloe said in his defense.  Lex shook his head as he returned to his seat. <br>
<br>
Thats not what I meant, he said.  Chloes lips formed a perfect o shape, her mind reeling back to the time in the Talon when he admitted to Luke being right about him liking her.  And Id like to think that if he had been treating you right, that I wouldnt have acted on my feelings; but I cant say Im sorry that ---<br>
<br>
Im glad you did, Chloe interrupted.  Lex looked surprised and she reached her hand out to him.  When he took it, she gave his hand a squeeze and continued.  You werent there, Lex.  Even if Luke *had* been a great guy the entire time we were going out, he would have snapped eventually.  Im glad you intervened and that hes going to get help now.  Lex gave her a pleased grin and nodded once.<br>
<br>
He is, he agreed.  Hes been admitted to the same mental health care facility that his mom is in.  And in addition to having the finest staff of professionals to treat him, they also have the best security --- hell never hurt you again, Chloe.  Chloe grinned.<br>
<br>
Why do I get the feeling that youll be hanging around me just to make sure? she teased. <br>
<br>
Oh, absolutely, Lex replied with a smug expression on his face.  Twenty-four-seven; whatever it takes to make you feel safe.  Chloe let laughter sweep through her body and Lex couldnt help but smile.  Only his Chloe could go through an ordeal like she had been through and still be able to laugh just a short while later.  <br>
<br>
Listen, Lex  about *us* --- she paused when she saw the expectant look on his face.  She could tell that he was worried about what she was going to say.  You were my first  and despite the circumstances, I think that says a lot.<br>
<br>
About that --- we didnt use a condom.  There could be a possibility that ---<br>
<br>
You had better not have given me anything, Luthor, she said warningly.  Lex let out a small laugh with her accusation.<br>
<br>
No, no, he protested, holding his hands up in defense, Im clean.  I meant ---<br>
<br>
O-oh, Chloe strung out with understanding.  Well, I hate to shoot down whatever hopes you might have had, but I assure you  there is no baby Luthor on the way.  A couple of years ago, my doctor put me on the pill for hormone balance issues, she explained, using her fingers to make quotation marks in the air.  Lex smiled back at her.<br>
<br>
Is it working?<br>
<br>
Hard to say, Chloe said with mock thoughtfulness.  But I really think the only reason he put me on them was because I disagreed with his archaic belief that women should be baby machines  but hey  dont look a gift horse in the mouth, right?  Otherwise, you and I could be talking about child support.  Lex threw his head back as a deep laugh released from his throat. <br>
<br>
Im fairly certain that your dad would prefer that I marry you, he finally said.  Chloe arched an eyebrow at him, not wanting to explore too deeply into the meaning behind the distinctive glint in his eye.<br>
<br>
How is he? she asked instead.  Lexs smile fell to a mere grin.<br>
<br>
He seems to be holding up remarkably well, he answered.  He was undeniably pleased when my father was arrested for assisting Luke, albeit without his knowledge; or so he claims at any rate.  Chloe snickered.<br>
<br>
Sure youre not just projecting your own feelings onto my dad? she asked.  Lex shrugged and gave her a smirk.<br>
<br>
Its entirely possible, he admitted.  So, about *us* - what do you want to do?  Chloes eyebrows rose in surprise and mirth.<br>
<br>
Youre giving me a choice? she asked somewhat teasingly.  <br>
<br>
Sure, he said, but the tone of his voice and the grin on his face suggested otherwise.<br>
<br>
Well, in that case --- she burst out in laughter at the warning look on his face.  Calm down.  I dont want to break up anymore than you do.<br>
<br>
Does that mean youre acknowledging the fact that were going out?<br>
<br>
Like Id even need to?  My own dad told me that he thinks you love me and to break it off with you now if I wasnt serious about you.  I think thats kind of a tip-off that people already know about us.<br>
<br>
He said that?<br>
<br>
Yeah.<br>
<br>
So --- *are* you serious?<br>
<br>
Chloe narrowed her eyes a little when she saw the same glint return to Lexs expression that had been there when he was talking about her father forcing him to marry her.  She couldnt stop the small chuckle that erupted from her mouth.<br>
<br>
Youre in league with my OB/GYN, arent you? she joked, but sighed and ran a hand through her already messy hair when Lex smirked at her.  Yes, Im serious, and no, Im not having your child.<br>
<br>
Eventually?<br>
<br>
Maybe.<br>
<br>
Lex grinned and rose from his seat once again to kiss her.  Their lips moved against each other for only a few moments when Lex pulled away and rested his forehead against hers, waiting for the answer to his unspoken question about *how* serious she was.  As if reading his mind, she smiled at him.<br>
<br>
I love you, she said quietly and with a hint of uncertainty.<br>
<br>
I love you too, he said and gave her another quick brush across her lips.  Any regrets?<br>
<br>
Are you suggesting I chose the wrong brother?<br>
<br>
Never; but I know this isnt going to be easy for you.  Our fathers have been taken care of, but theres still the matter of your friends.<br>
<br>
Theyll deal.<br>
<br>
And if they dont? Lex asked.<br>
<br>
Then we wont invite them to the wedding, Chloe teased.  <br>
<br>
Lexs body shook with his laughter against her.  <br>
<br>
He loved this woman.<br>
<br>
And after a battle with his brother, she loved him too.<br>
<br>
Lex leaned forward and kissed her again, her hands wrapping around the back of his neck and head to pull him closer.  <br>
<br>
He had won.  And winning was a very, very good thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
