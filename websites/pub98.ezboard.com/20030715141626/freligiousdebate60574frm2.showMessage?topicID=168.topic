<br>
&quot;First a little background info...I don't know if you all know, but in the UK, religion has to be taught in schools by law - primarily Xianity (you are Xian by default here), but also a little bit of Islam and Hindi too. So my eldest daughter and my son both have religious assemblies every day at school..and get taught bible stories as fact. To combat this we have always taught them that *some* people believe in a god..others don't, and if they decide that they believe in a god then that is fine..but they shouldn't feel like they have to just to fit in...<br>
<br>
Anyway - My eldest daughter is 7, and has recently been told at school by her friends that she will go to hell because she doesn't believe in god. Since then she has said that she does believe in god, and that she would like to go to Sunday school. Also she has recently joined the Brownies and has chosen the &quot;Faith&quot; badge as her first badge to work towards - this involves learning about a religion, taking part in its rituals etc...<br>
<br>
Well...I've told her that I don't have a problem with her going to Sunday school and that we will sort it out for her..but I don't know where to start. When I was younger I went to Sunday school (and hated it) at the United Reformed Church in my hometown. In the village that we live in, we have a Church of England church, and a Christian Outreach Centre - I'm leaning more towards the Christian Outreach Centre, as they seem to be a bit more modern and &quot;fun&quot;. The town up the road has several churches, methodist, baptist, catholic, CofE, United Reformed, Quakers, kingdom hall etc...<br>
<br>
Anyway...my question is....does it really matter which church I send her to? I suppose I'll have to go with her to begin with..as the majority of churches have the service first and the Sunday school afterwards...so it isn't a question of making sure the people are ok (as I'll be there with her) - but is there really that much of a difference between all the different churches? I'd prefer to send her to one of the local ones....so it is either CofE or CoC...<br>
<br>
Any advice or comments would be appreciated. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )&quot;<br>

I think there's a listing of UU churches in the UK at this website: [<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.unitarian.org.uk/">www.unitarian.org.uk/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->]<br>
If there is one close, I would highly recommend it as a way for your child to attend a Sunday School, recieve a broad religious education, and have your religious beliefs be accepted.<br>
<br>
I would be a bit wary of more relaxed, &quot;hipper&quot; religious organisations--in my experience they tend to be more on the evangelical side as opposed to more established religions (like the C of E) that are more doctrinal and ceremonial.<br>
<br>
Good luck--what's happening to you is exactly what my mom always threatens will happen to us as punishment for leaving the church of our childhood.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I see that you say there is a Kingdom Hall in a near by town.  Not that you were thinking of taking your daughter there, but I just wanted to let you know that they don't offer Sunday School at the Kingdom Halls.  You would have to take her there every time and sit through the service yourself.  And, not to dog on my own religion, but they would probably not leave you alone about your beliefs.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I hate to recommend something away from my own religion, but I think in your case taking her to something more fun would be more of a benefit to you and to her. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would also like to commend you on being so open-minded, there are not too many parents out there that would do this for their children.  In fact, there are not too many parents here that would be so open-minded about their adult children trying out other religions (or however that should be worded).  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I wish you the best on this endevor.  I am sure that it will work out for the best.<br>

Why not try out both of them? Or look into all the church's neaerby? Let her make the choice of where she wants to go. Take two months and just explore churches with her. <br>
<br>
I applaud you for doing this for your child. But I think which ever child told her she is going to hell if she doesn't believe should be beaten (kidding-sorta). She shouldn't feel frightened into religion. IMO. I personally would look for a church which doesn't spend alot of time dwelling on hell and being born again. <br>
<br>
From personal experience, I've known very few catholic priests who have talked about hell, and can't ever remember one talking about it during mass. Same goes for Episcopalian. But while I haven't gone to too many baptist, or other churches - every other church, hell was mentioned in every service. I was so turned off. <br>
<br>

I was actually leaning the other way with CofE versus CoC - I was thinking that the CoC would be much more fun..whereas CofE will be very traditional and a bit boring. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
The cynic in me just wishes I could tell her to ignore it and stand firm with what we have taught her...but at the end of the day...we only have our *beliefs* to go on...and if she truly doesn't share them, then I'm not going to stand in the way of her finding out what her beliefs are...(although I'm not entirely sure how much she has even thought about it before now...I think the fact that they have had a push on morality at school - which equates to religious teaching, and the fact that she has just taken her Brownie promise, have both kind of coloured her judgement a bit).<br>
<br>
So anyway..I'll let you all know how we get on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.growthspurts.com/drivee/images/434360233606.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 218<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/1/03 10:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=168.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hmmmm....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>...but at the end of the day...we only have our *beliefs* to go on...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Personally, I would make her tell you where she wants to go.  If she is doing this out of peer pressure as it sounds, then just any church won't do.  It will only serve to shift the reason she is going to hell from not believing to going to hell for believing the wrong thing.  Also, I disagree with you about the only having our beliefs to go on.  We have reason and logic and I trust those far more than I do belief.  I would allow her to go to church, but I would not stop asking her questions and making her think.  Why do you think the minister said that?  What do you think this sacrament means?  How do you feel about god doing all that stuff back then but not doing it anymore?  Why is something ‘absolute’ or what does this say about their view of women?<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, we have a surplus of beliefs to choose from, and we only have our logic to go on.<br>

Here in GB it is pretty different to in USA I think. A church is just a church - the fact that she doesn't go to church or believe in a god *at all* is what makes her stand out.  If she went to *a* church, it wouldn't matter *which* church, because the discussions don't get beyond the &quot;I believe in god&quot; stage.<br>
<br>
Religion on the whole is a much more private thing here...so kids don't go around talking about how people at other churches are going to hell..because they don't get taught that kind of thing - we don't have any fundie churches round here.<br>
<br>
Anyway...I agree with you about the logic and reason thing...but my thinking is, that if I stop her from going now, she is just going to get more curious, and end up doing it behind our backs when she is older (more chance of getting in deep then).  I'm pretty sure this will just be a fad..she will go a couple of times and lose interest. <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:medium;">There's no such thing as Rock 'n' Roll Faeries - Rhiannon, aged 7</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=168.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=168.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=168.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=168.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.threadControl?topicID=168.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=168.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=168.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="religiousdebate60574frm2">Debate Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm10">Christianity Discussions (G Rated)<option value="religiousdebate60574frm1">Announcements<option value="religiousdebate60574frm11">Test Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm5">Help Files</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574>religiousdebate</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2>Debate Forum</a> <font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
