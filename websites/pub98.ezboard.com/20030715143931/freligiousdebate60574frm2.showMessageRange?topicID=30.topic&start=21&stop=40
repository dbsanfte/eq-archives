<br>
First off, I do think it is sad, and extremely bad in appearance for religions, to see what others do in the name of religion. So many people do terrible things in the name of God and call it religion, call themselves whatever they may, believe they are saved because they did something they see as spiritually noble. In regards to 9/11, I remember thinking about how religious types must have looked to those who didn't believe in God. I remember thinking that for me, who believes in God, thinking &quot;How could someone believe that God would want this?&quot; and yet for someone who doesn't believe in God, I'm sure that the anger ran even deeper. For me, I do have one thing in common with those terrorists... I believe in that higher power, that God that they believe they did this for. I believe that they are getting their just rewards for what they did and I don't think it is paradise for them. I believe Hell was created for people like that. Anyway, I digress... those who don't maintain a belief in God or a higher power, afterlife, I'm sure it is just down right reprehensible to think that someone did something like that for absolutely NOTHING... <br>
<br>
It's interesting to me that as an LDS member, I can look at the Mountain Meadows Massacre and see the absolute disgrace it was. I can see how it was needless for those people to die and that it never should have happened. Yet, unlike the terrorists of 9/11, I can imagine what the early Mormon's were most likely feeling. I can see how they would be afraid, untrusting and how they attacked wrongfully because they weren't sure if these people in the wagon train were really there to exterminate them. It was still wrong. I don't know. I don't know enough about that event but even if they were afraid, striking as they did was wrong (hmmm... seems similar  to the &quot;pre-emptive strike&quot; that looks to be inevitable in Iraq) and yet at the same time, to sit back and see if they are going to kill you first doesn't provide much security for your family. Maybe it is because I am a member of the same church that I can find &quot;reasons&quot; or justifications for why that happened. Yet I can't even begin to justify why someone would fly a plane into a building. <br>
<br>
In reality, Christian religions, if they truly follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, would not look for fights, be aggressors in a murder, etc... Christ, whether you believe he was divine or not, taught to turn the other cheek and because Christian religions believe that he was the Messiah and that he was not an ordinary man, base their belief systems on his teaching and example. <br>
<br>
I guess I don't really know where I was going with this... It's getting too late to remember what my point was even going to be.  But, totally OT, I would really like to express a gripe I have... does it bother anyone but me that our government is looking for Americans to blame for 9/11? They are trying to pin down who was responsible... I'll tell ya who, the terrorists! They are the ones who chose to do what they did and yet we Americans are constantly trying to find other people to blame! I'm sorry but that is what my 3 yr old does. The terrorists are to blame... no one else. Sure, there were cracks in our Intelligence but you know, they are not mind readers, the last time I checked. Just had to add that since I didn't have anywhere else to post it! Been stewing over it for a couple weeks and it feels great to finally say it somewhere! Sorry!<br>

Of course, for me, I see the difference between a war started by men for men and a war start by God for God.  I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses though and I can say that my religon has not taken any part in a war in modern times back to at least WWI.  We are imprisoned for not going to war, not backing wars, and not supporting the war efforts.  We may knock on your door, but we won't kill you if you slam it in our faces.<br>

Conscientious objection is valid and you need only be on the roles (as I'm sure you are at the Kingdom Hall) as a church member and you'll be just fine in the case of a draft. <br>
<br>
BTW--your history IS the same as the other xians and you follow the same bible in which your god often commands the murder, rape, enslavement, pillaging and other nasty deeds to his followers. You may stray from that now, but it is your past and your god's word as well unless you want to toss the entire OT and parts of the NT, which I know JWs don't want to do. After all, like other xians you still embrace the 10 Commandments and feel homosexuality is a sin (okay fine, you ignore the other parts of the OT about shellfish and wool garments, but you kwim).<br>
<br>
That said I am VERY interested in speaking with a JW--rare on a BB and often prohibited from associating with &quot;worldly&quot; heatens living in &quot;the system&quot; such as myself. I am eager to hear you speak on other topics.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Also, I understand that there were wars in the OT and parts of the NT, but because I have a belief in God, I know that these wars were holy and for the good of God's chosen nation.  The wars of today are wars of man. For me there is a big difference.  People that don't have a belief in God won't agree and I don't expect them to.  <br>
<br>
Witnesses are usually not &quot;prohibited&quot; to do things.  It may be recommended, but not prohibited.  I have no problem talking about anything, but I won't try to convince and athiest that there is a God, it won't work and I respect that.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have told them I'm not interested, told them I was busy, explained I was an atheist, explained I wasn't interested, and never once have I not had to resort to shutting the door.<br>
<br>
I know, from my childhood, and growing up with a JW family, that this is not the norm. My JW friends in high school were truly kind people, and would have never pushed it, I believe.<br>
<br>
However, where I'm at, there's a problem. I don't even answer the door anymore when I see them. I have a sign in the window of my door that says- &quot;No solicitation- commercial or religious&quot;. When I pointed to that the last time the JW came around, one of them said, &quot;We're not selling anything- we just want to talk about the Bible&quot;....Aaaarrrrgggghhhh. Selling raffle tickets or selling Jesus, a solicitation is a solicitation, and annoying if not welcomed.<br>
<br>
All right- off topic, but I had to get it off my chest. I was really frustrated the last time, and made a vow never to answer the door again.<br>

As far JW not supporting any wars, thats right because JW do not support or recognize any government other than god. So don't try to infer that it is because you are only opposed to war. You do not support anything the government chooses.<br>
<br>
&quot;Witnesses are usually not &quot;prohibited&quot; to do things. It may be recommended, but not prohibited.&quot;<br>
<br>
Your right you don't but you love to DF people to get them to choose the right thing. You would rather turn your back on people to try to &quot;guide&quot; them to what is right. Than try to show them what is right.<br>

Actually it is more accurate to say they do not support or do anything with the government at all except pay taxes. They do not vote, participate in polls, run for office in any way support the govt.

Oh and as for not being prohibited--this is veeeery slippery. My MIL would NEVER have a blood transfusion because of the no cannibalism verse in the bible (I know go figure how that got worked out) and would never have had a transplant, but that was recently changed. I wonder how they get all the blood molecules off each and every organ transplanted into JW's....hmmm<br>
<br>
Oh--and yes she could come to her granddaughter/son's birthday but that would be &quot;putting one man above another&quot; (of course an anniversary is okay--putting a married couple above must be somehow different), but then she would be terribly ostracized. Like I have said before, if dh had been baptized in that religion she would never, ever speak to us or her grandchildren, which thanks to her prosyletizing and involvement in the church taking a higher priority than her family, she hardly does now anyway...sad really. More for her than anyone.<br>

<br>
If you want to know about the birthday and anniversary thing I will tell you, but I am not going to waste the space if you don't want to know.  <br>
<br>
Also, everyone that is ever baptized knows ahead of time what is being asked of them when it comes to being disfellowshipped.  It seems like everyone that I hear complain about this aspect of this religon acts like it was some big suprise. A person studies the Bible and the religous beliefs before getting baptized.  There is no suprise about what disfellowshipping is or what the consequenses are for it.<br>

<br>
Well, I cannot speak for all LDS let alone all Christians, and no doubt there are some who are motivated by fear of the consequences, but the way you (DBC) described why you do things is very similar to why I would. I don't think the motivations differ so much as what we think the product will be. Some people believe we will still exist as ourselves after this life and take all the characterstics we build in ourselves with us and other do not believe that. I guess we also differ in how we decide what the &quot;right&quot; things are, for instance I think the guidance of the Spirit can aid us, though I do not believe it is supposed to replace reason, it supplements it.<br>

2: playing a musical instrument is really a rewarding experience for both you and the people who listen. If you learn about music and practice to refine your skills you can become a great musician, enriching your own life as well as those around you<br>
<br>
I think along the lines of scenario 2. Though doing the right thing is inherently rewarding, we don't do it in order to &quot;gain a reward&quot;. Like, you find showing your parents the respect they deserve satisfying, even though that isn't the reason you do it necesarily.  Are we very far off from each other in our thinking there?<br>

Three scenarios in reply.<br>
I. Atheist plays music as in #2 because it brings them joy.<br>
II. Xian plays music as in #1 then they tell everyone it is just like #2 (because the guy is still threatening them and rewarding them, no matter what they say their reasons are.)<br>
III. A person is threatened as in #1 only instead to NOT play, but they do anyway.<br>
<br>
Who here has the greatest love?  I would submit that it is the one in (III) who does right and turns their back on the threats anyway.  After them I would say it is the atheist in (I) and lastly the theist in (II).  You see, irrespective of why you say you do something, that threat and reward is still hanging out there so you’ll never truly know for certain.  Even if you think you do it for (I) your parents still raised you because of (II) and the threat it carried.  As long as you carry the faith, you carry the stigmata as well.<br>

The same way you explain how to feel and recognize wool or silk. You prove it exists physically and with science or better yet, provide a swatch in person so s/he can see and feel it (referring to tactile feelings here rather than emotions).<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>my brother-in-law is deathly allergic to any kind of nut (with the exception of me) so how would you explain to him what peanut butter tastes like?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
But dag you are not trying to get anyone to know what the spirits or gods you worship and feel &quot;taste&quot; like, you are trying to prove they exist. Surely your BIL doesn't deny the existence of peanuts, but if he did there are plenty of ways we could prove to him they exist without putting one on his tongue.<br>

I see what you are saying, but I don't think you are fully catching on to what my beliefs are.  I'm not a &quot;lake of fire and brimstone&quot; Christian.<br>

You seem to agree that there is satsifaction and fulfilment to be had by doing &quot;good&quot; things in life (showing respect for others, developing talents, etc.).  I believe there is no end to how long we will be able to love, learn, and grow and experience that satisfaction unless we put the end on it ourselves by choosing not to try and develop to our full potential.<br>
<br>
I just don't see how the length of time a person believes they will exists or the fact that they show gratitude toward the being they believe made it all possible for them changes what their motivation for their actions is, it just puts them in a larger/different frame.

<br>
At one point I said:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think the guidance of the Spirit can aid us, though I do not believe it is supposed to replace reason, it supplements it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And dag said somewhere after that, possibly misinterpreting what I meant:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>i too see faith as supplementation<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I actually do not think of faith and the Spirit as interchangeable, they are two different things.<br>
<br>
Faith, to me, is a belief in something this is true but which can't be seen or proved, at least at the current time.<br>
<br>
The Spirit is like our conscience.  It <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>is not supposed to replace reason.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  It guides it, supplements it.  It can also supplement our faith and make it stronger, but faith and the Spirit are not the same thing.<br>
<br>
For instance, if a person were theorizing about something, the Spirit might help lead them toward the correct path to pursue to find the answer and help the person recognize the answer when it is found.<br>
<br>
Faith, would be like believing the Word of Wisdom (dietary guide for LDS) and following it even though you didn't understand the specifics of why it was healthier. Many people did not use tobacco because they had faith that the Word of Wisdom was true.  Nowadays, we know a whole lot about why smoking and chewing it is unhealthy, so knowledge has replaced faith in that way.  We are to have Faith until that day when we have a sure knowledge.<br>
<br>
The whole purpose of life is to come here and be able to learn for ourselves what is good and what is not  and then act accordingly (agency) and reap the consequences good and bad.<br>
<br>
For that reason, true religion should not replace reason and logic, to the contrary it should demand it's use IMO.  We strive to be above doing things because of outside forces,  to move beyond doing things simply because &quot;it's the norm&quot; (even if the right choice is &quot;the norm&quot; that shouldn't be why we choose it), and instead  do things because that is inherently who we are, because it is our will to do them.<br>
<br>
God's will is perfect, and He would like us to develop ours to be like His and does try to guide us that way, but does not force us, he couldn't, it wouldn't work that way any more than a pianist could transfer his ability into another person.<br>
<br>
But true religion will also include things of a spiritual nature.  The Spirit and knowledge will never contradict each other, Truth is Truth.    If there is an apparent contradiction either a person is listening to their &quot;comfort zone&quot; and crediting it to the Spirit or else they are missing something in their secular search for knowledge, KWIM?<br>

<br>
Yes, I do. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think instead of saying that acknowledging a higher being and trying to follow his edicts and the &quot;spirit&quot; doesn't alter motivation, you mean to say that even if it does, this change is not necessarily coercive or negative. That makes more sense to me personally because I cannot imagine believing in a creator that speaks to me and has outlined what he wants and not doing those things either out of fear, selfishness (getting to become a god or go to heaven) or just plain love for a father and the need to please him. <br>
<br>
If you want to stick to your guns and original statement above and I am all wrong about your intentions--sorry, but then that only means you agree with so many atheists who feel morality and the motivation to do &quot;good&quot; in the world is independent of god and then he's not necessary. This would put you somewhere between dag and DBC and I can certainly see the logic in that argument but it just seems odd to me to hear a religious person say that s/he is not motivated to act differently because of her/his faith than if s/he were an atheist...please clarify and sorry again if my first paragraph here assumed too much.<br>
