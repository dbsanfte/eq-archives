<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Full Moon</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
They say the full moon makes people go a little crazy.  I agree with them.  Back on Earth, almost every raid we had was on a full moon.  The main reason being we could see in the dark better and wouldn’t need to use light sticks.  Now that I think about it though, I realize that we all did go a little crazy.  You couldn’t call anyone who did what we did sane.  Every time we went out, there was always that chance of not coming back, but the funny thing is that humans reach a point where death doesn’t matter so much anymore.  I saw it everyday so it was no big deal for me.  If I got shot or killed, I died.  Big freaken whoop.  I wouldn’t care cause I’d be dead and I really hadn’t had anything to live for.  I have things to live for now and when I look back and realize how lucky I’d been my hands shake and I have to sit down and regain my composure.  <br>
<br>
Raids were fun.  It was our way of getting back at the stupid ubers.  Right before I let the shrillers off the adrenaline was coursing thorough my blood, the chemicals from the air were filling my lungs, and my limbs felt like lead.  The scared, excited, nervous feelings all jumbled into one and gave me a natural high, probably because I absolutely loved killing Nietzcheans but the survival instinct was kicking in and I was scared stiff of getting caught or dying.  Even a person who’s desperate to die will fight and claw and bite their way free from an enemy, purely because of their survival instinct.  <br>
<br>
It was all worth it though.  Getting those animals back was a treat.  I hated them more than I hated being stuck on a dirty slave planet, and I enjoyed every kill I had.  I lived for the smell of Nietzchean blood after they had killed my parents.  I’d never tell anyone on the Andromeda because I don’t want them knowing I’ve killed in cold blood an infinite number of times.  Beka would probably never look at me again.  Looking back at how animalistic I was and how I had survived on that hellhole, I can’t help but laugh.  It would’ve been a whole lot easier if I hadn’t put my life in danger countless times.  I can’t say I didn’t know what I was doing.  I did, and I loved every second of it.  I was nuts, but I loved it.  Maybe it was the hate I harbored, or the sadness and grief, but then again, maybe the full moon really does make people go a little crazy.<br>
<br>
**********<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Just Cry</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
My father never cried.  When my sister died, he buried her, but he didn’t shed a tear.  When my uncle died, he buried him, but no water fell from his eyes.  When my cousins died, he buried them because their mother was too heartsick to do it herself.  When my aunt died of grief, he buried her, right next to her husband and children.  <br>
<br>
After seeing death as much as he did I suppose he lost the ability to show how he felt.  He couldn’t cry but he did laugh and smile.  I get my lame sense of humor from my father.  He was a hard man but he was full of pride and love…for me.  He saved me, in as many ways as a person can be saved.  He rescued me in heart, body, and mind.  I’m the man I am today because of him.  <br>
<br>
My dad was my idol.  He was intelligent, strong, brave, and courageous, all the things I’ve always strived to be.  I think I’ve actually managed quite well.  Hell, I’m on the best ship in the galaxy having the time of my life, so I must’ve done something right.  Even though I’m happy now, I still have regrets.  Going back to Earth, reminded me of many things I’d rather have forgotten.  My father would still be alive if it wasn’t for me.  So would my mom.  That’s a mind-set I’ve lived with all my life, until my cousin told me I was wrong.  I think I’m ready to move on now.  I know they’d understand.<br>
<br>
As I stand here, staring out in space, I remember there was one thing my dad could do that I couldn’t and still can’t.  Believe me, I’ve tried my hardest to be exactly like him, but I guess I’m just too sentimental.  Ya see, my dad buried all his relatives and friends and didn’t shed a tear.  He was taught not to get emotionally attached, a mistake I’ve made numerous times.  <br>
<br>
My parents died protecting me and left me with enough guilt for thousands of lifetimes.  When I had to carry their still, cold, stiff, lifeless bodies out of the camp and I had to use my own shovel to cut through the hard, unforgiving ground, I couldn’t do it.  I couldn’t do it the way my dad always did, the way I knew he’d be proud to see me do it.  I actually held up quite well until I had to pile the dirt over their faces, and it became real.  When I finally realized for the first time they were gone forever, I broke down and cried, just like I’m doing right now.  I’m sobbing, holding my whistle that I thought I’d buried with my dad, and am just letting all my guilt go, and for the first time in my life I feel free.  Normally I’d be ashamed of myself for losing it, but you know what, I’ve learned something since then.  My father was a great person and an awesome man but sometimes, no matter who you are, you just have to cry.<br>
<br>
**********<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Maybe</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
They’re gone.  At first I didn’t believe it but now I know it’s true.  I’ve turned the Maru upside down in my desperate searches.  I know every crack, cranny, and hidden compartment.  They’re not in any of them, which meant they’re gone.  The truth hit me like a slap across the face.  Sadness, anger, grief, and devastation were just some of the emotions that sped through me.  Dylan tried to console me but he didn’t understand.  He couldn’t.  I felt like my heart had been ripped out and shred to pieces, but it was an all too familiar feeling.  I was not innocent when it came to death.<br>
<br>
As I lay on Beka’s bunk in the Maru, I can smell sweat mingled with spicy perfume.  I remember how many times I was comforted and nursed and looked after by that smell, by Beka.  I cling to it as I try hard not to lose myself to wracking sobs.  In my experiences, I’ve discovered that if you hold your breath and just stare at something without blinking it almost numbs the pain, but as soon as you breathe again it comes back worse than before.  The trick is to do it over and over again until you can’t cry anymore.  I’m almost to that point.  I still feel sick with grief but I’ve stopped physically gagging.<br>
<br>
You could say I’m a seasoned veteran when it comes to dealing with death.  My mom, dad, cousins, uncles, and aunt have all died in my sight.  When I decided to leave Earth I promised I’d never get close to anyone again, but then I met Beka.  I hated her boyfriend but I felt a need to help her and be with her.  Over the years we got close.  Then Trance and Rev joined the team and I eventually got close to them as well, another mistake.  Rev’s gone.  He’s not coming back either, but I’ve already cried over that.  Tyr would be disgusted if he knew, had *known*, how many times I cry.  I never told him how much his mentoring meant to me, but I think he knew. We were in tune to each other and he liked me for some odd reason and I liked him too.  I doubt think I’ll ever see him again.<br>
<br>
Rommie says I’m wallowing in self-pity but I’m not, not really anyways.  I’m trying to face reality as I lay here.  I’m not hiding.  I’m *not*.  I’m trying to smother myself with Beka’s pillow because I want to the hurt to go away, not because I want to die and not ever feel pain again.  It’s not that I’ve lost the will to live, it’s just that I’m too tired to care anymore.  Too tired, that’s a good way to describe how I feel.  I’m tried of death.  I’m sick and tired of people I love dying.  Even though Beka and Tyr might not be dead, they're still gone and I probably won’t ever see them again.  <br>
<br>
I’m alone again.  Rommie’s a machine, Dylan’s never been close to me, and Trance isn’t Trance anymore.  I’ll survive though.  I’ve always survived and I’ll continue to.  Out of instinct or hope, I’m not sure.  Maybe I’ll see Beka again.  Maybe Brendan’s still alive.  Maybe Tyr will show up out of the blue some day.  Maybe Dylan will take Beka’s place in my life.  Maybe Rommie will love me.  Maybe Trance will change back.  Then again, probably not.  But there’s always a chance.  Maybe.  I live on that lone word.  I always have.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hero</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Heroes have, for centuries, been thought of as people who fly above cities and deliver others from danger.  I know that’s not true, but I wish it was. I know how broken the universe has become since I was born.  Sometimes I wonder if it’s partially my fault.  I had been there.  I should have stopped the Nietzcheans.  If I had only seen what was coming I could’ve been better prepared, but I hadn’t and I wasn’t.  At least I have a second chance.  I can help restore the Commonwealth and try to drive the bad from the universe, even though I haven’t done the best job so far.  Beka and Tyr are gone…missing.  Harper’s locked himself in his room and refuses to talk to anyone, including Rommie.  He needs to be comforted but I’m a lot more worried about someone else at the moment.  The one person who can possibly put up a small defense against the evil that’s to come may be about to make a terrible mistake.  The vision of red is fresh in my memory as I jog hurriedly to their quarters.  I open the door and am filled with relief at that sight that greets me.  Dylan’s sleeping peacefully in his bed.  As I creep quietly to him he mumbles something incoherent from his dreams.  I sigh as a way to release my pent up tension.  The future I had seen hadn’t played itself out, but just to be sure I walk to the future hero’s nightstand and put the razor that’s lying there in my pocket.  I smile weakly to myself as I watch him sleep.  He’s going to need his rest when he faces what’s to come…  <br>
<br>
“We’ll get them back Dylan,” I say softly as I leave.  “In every future I can see, we get them back.”     <br>
<br>
*********<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rollercoaster</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Oh c’mon Dylan!  It’d be fun!” Harper whined.<br>
<br>
“Yah Mr. Captain Dylan sir, I think Harper’s got a good idea,” Trance chimed in.<br>
<br>
Dylan sighed as he found himself being dragged through the streets of the Lycoles Drift toward a very old, very unsturdy looking amusement park.<br>
<br>
“I really don’t think this is a good idea.  It doesn’t look very safe.  How old are you two anyways?!”  He asked exasperated, worrying that his two young crew members were going to pull his arms out of their sockets.  <br>
<br>
“Well, I’m 22, and I can’t speak for the mysterious purple pixie here.  However, I’m pretty sure we both want to go, right?”<br>
<br>
“Yes!” Trance yelled.  “I really, really, really would like that quite a lot.”<br>
<br>
Already at the entrance Dylan looked around, hoping Beka or Tyr might show up and rescue him.  After a few seconds, he realized it was futile and gave in and bought tickets for the three of them.  <br>
<br>
“You two owe me,” Dylan warned as he handed two tickets to each of them.  “Now what are we going to go on?  Sadly, two tickets means only one ride.  So what’s it going to be?”<br>
<br>
The blonde engineer and purple medical officer gazed around until both their eyes fell on the biggest roller coaster they’d ever seen. <br>
<br>
“That one!” They cried in unison.<br>
<br>
Dylan turned and groaned, “Maybe I should just sit this one out.”<br>
<br>
“Nuh-uh boss, you’re coming with us,” Harper insisted.<br>
<br>
“You know Harper I really don’t think we should be doing this.  Lets just go back on the Andromeda.  You can go fix something or do…whatever it is you do everyday.”<br>
<br>
“Tempting but, uh, no.  Now c’mon!”<br>
<br>
All of them boarded the roller coaster and were strapped under a long metal bar.  As it started it’s ascent the crackling and bucking of the rusted chain pulling the crew up could be heard.  Dylan gripped the bar until his knuckles turned white, Harper sat there with his arms in the air, and Trance absorbed everything with a big smile.  They rose higher and higher until they finally got to the part where the roller coaster car was supposed to go over and…stopped.<br>
<br>
“Ladies and gentlemen we are experiencing technical difficulties at this time.  Please try to get comfortable, for it may be a few hours before this problem is resolved.  Thank you.”  A grating, metallic voice came on over the intercom.<br>
<br>
“Oh great,” Harper sighed then looked at Dylan and winced.  “Hey, uh boss, you’ve got that look in your eye…”<br>
<br>
“Considering the fact that we do happen to have a few hours on our hands I'd like you to take the time to learn this mantra: &quot;Dylan is always right. I will listen to Dylan. I will not ignore Dylan’s recommendations. Dylan is God. And if this ever happens again, Dylan will personally rip your lungs out!&quot; <br>
<br>
His mouth agape it took Harper a few seconds to react.  “Alrighty then, I think it’s safe to say he’s cracked!  Let me out!  Let me down, he’s going to kill me!  Help!”<br>
<br>
Trance took it all in and giggled. <br>
<br>
See I told you it’d be fun,” Trance said as she took it all in and giggled.<br>

Oh yah, it's really fun to write it too.  Of course anything with Harper is fun to write and read.  I guess you could say he's sorta, kinda, maybe my favorite character.  lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>-----------------<br>
Beka- So, are you ever gonna tell me what you're doing locked in my ship with all the sensors cut?<br>
Harper- I can't, it's a secret.<br>
Beka- Harper, come on, we're friends. We have no secrets.<br>
Harper- Oh, okay. What's your natural hair color?<br>
Beka- I can't tell you, it's a secret.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heroicfool>HeroicFool</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://avatarshere.topcities.com/p/explosionwer.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#0000FF, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='user title'>Triumvir</span></td></tr></table>

It's a shame that harper just seems to be the funny little man that's good at fixing things recently...<br>
<br>
No more angst, no more hints at his dark past...<br>
<br>
Just weenie Harper that's good with a wrench.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
