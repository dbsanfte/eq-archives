Now that sounds pretty darn good. What do you think?&quot; Michael exclaimed eagerly to his business advisor Terrence Lofton. Michael trusted Terrence for over 15 years, and for the first time in their 15 year business relationship, Terrence didn't look too enthused by Michael's idea.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;What?? Why are you looking at me like that?&quot; Michael asked sternly.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Michael, you know I have always told you the truth, right?&quot; Terrence replied.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, that's why I hired you. You don't like my idea, do you?&quot; Michael replied with a bit of disappointment in his voice.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I just think you need to concentrate on MJJ Productions, not a new label. You haven't fully developed the label you have&quot; Terrence said.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I see. Well, I don't know what to say. Let me ask you this: If this was another person, say Madonna who had this concept, what would you say?&quot; Michael's voice dropped about three octaves. A low, dangerous monotone. He meant business, and Terrence didn't catch on immediately to his mood.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Mike... Madonna is different. Maverick is a hit. She concentrates on her label more. Now if she started another label, especially a dance one, it would be a succ...&quot; Terrence's words trailed off as he noticed Michael's eyes. Then he noticed Michael's face, set like a stone statue. He knew he had put his foot in his mouth.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;So, you're saying that MJJ Productions is a failure.... Are you saying Madonna is more of a business man than I? What are you saying exactly?&quot; Michael swirled around in his chair, looking out at Madison Avenue from his office window.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Now wait a minute Michael. Let's be honest about something. Madonna's label is basically run by one of the top A&amp;R people in the country. Possibly the top in the industry. In the last 5 years, you have been through so much drama, personal and business wise, that you actually believe you can split your attention with another label, two kids, two &quot;wives&quot; and several music publishing companies, and your own career? Are ya kidding me??&quot; Terrence chuckled in amazement.<br>
<br>
<br>
Michael swirled around in his chair to face Terrence. &quot;Two wives huh?&quot; Michael stood up and faced him. &quot;Let me tell you something, I can do whatever I want to. I have never failed at a business idea have I? If I want another label strictly for dance, techo, trip-hop, and electronica, DAMN IT I WILL. Your job is to go out and get me that top A&amp;R executive from Madonna's label. Do whatever it takes. DO I HAVE TO DO THIS MYSELF?&quot; Michael sat down and sighed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Terrence stood his ground and said to Michael, &quot;Maybe you have to Michael.&quot; At Michael's startled look, Terrence continued. &quot;How can I persuade Passion DeMarse to abandon perhaps the hottest label in the industry? My god, she's the number 3 person at that label. Why would she leave it for yours?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Because, I can give her the credit, the freedom, and the power that she doesn't have at Warner Brother's. Lets face it. All the credit goes to Madonna and her president, Freddy LeMann. I've never heard of DeMarse until a couple of years ago. I want her at this label. I'll make her president. If anyone can build the company I have in mind, she can. Please don't give me a headache, Teddy. Just do my bidding. OK?&quot; Michael put his head in his hands. &quot;By the way, Terrence...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Michael?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;MJJ Productions is not a flop, understand?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't mean it the way it sounded, I...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I know what you meant... And about the two wives remark...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Mike, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I was kidding!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Terrence, you're fired...&quot; Michael said with a smile.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;HUH??? B..B..BUT MIKE?? Terrence almost cried.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't mean it. I was KIDDING..heeheeheehee&quot; Michael said with a vicious grin. &quot;Now contact Miss DeMarse and schedule a meeting between the three of us for Friday at my Trump Tower apartment. Have a good evening, Terrence.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Passion burst into her Central Park West apartment and threw her trench coat off into the middle of the floor. She launched herself on her couch, threw her shoe's across the room and accidentally dropped her laptop computer on the floor.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;ARRGH!!&quot; she screamed.<br>
<br>
<br>
She didn't have a nice day at the office. She wanted to sign these three D.J.'s, the Fonk Brothers, to a production deal. Her idea was shot down a month ago by her superior. But a Phantasy Records executive saw them and tried to sign them last week. When Madonna read about the Fonk Brothers impending deal in an industry trade paper, she went into a tirade about how the label was becoming stagnant. She blamed the staff, and her in particular, for a lackadaisical attitude. Madonna wasn't informed that Passion almost signed the hottest dance re-mixers in the business a month earlier. That was the final straw for Passion. Sure, she got the props, but only by her peers in the industry, not by her superiors, the media, anyone. She finally conceded that she was at a dead end in her career. She got up off the couch and went to her bedroom to put on her sweats. She looked into her bedroom mirror. She looked the way she felt, horrible. The humidity of N.Y. made her long, straight hair nap up. Instead of the beautifully coifed long flowing Kenyan wheat colored hair, it looked like Mariah Carey on a bad weave day.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I swear I'm going to relax this s--some day&quot; she said disgusted. She pulled her mid-length hair into a ponytail, finished dressing, and returned into the living room. The red light on her answering machine was blinking. The indicator had 5 messages. &quot;God mother. Can't cha give me a break for one day?!&quot; Passion felt like screaming. The first four were indeed from her mother, but the fifth one was from Terrence Lofton. It said: &quot;Miss DeMarse, my name is Terrence Lofton and I'm affiliated with Sony/Epic Records. I would like to schedule a meeting with you concerning your possible future here at Sony. Please call me anytime. We would like to see you Friday. My number is 555-0987. I hope this meeting will benefit all three of us. Goodbye Miss DeMarse.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Passion played the message about 3 times. &quot;Benefit the three of us? Hmm, I wonder... I think I'll call mother.&quot;<br>
