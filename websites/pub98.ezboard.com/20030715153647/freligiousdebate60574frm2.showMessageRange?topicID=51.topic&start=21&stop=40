I would say though that there's a fundamental point here worth looking at. I often hear tough talk from people about cracking down on this or that or making more stringent laws. Every law we make is a compromise on civil liberty--one we would probably all agree is necessary, but for this reason needs to be watched with a careful eye. We could put tracking chips in the arms of every person at birth, video tape all public movements, transportations, financial transactions and even who sees what movie, buys what CDs etc. and institute a curfew for all citizens at 9pm every night and this would DEFINITELY reduce crime. It would also be a sort of crime in intself and chip away to such a degree our individual freedom and civil rights the end result would be disastrous. <br>
<br>
Security vs. personal freedom. This actually brings us full circle to our Leviation conversation about the social contract. Regardless of the existence of a deity, we must all decide to what degree we will live in the natural vs. governed state. This is an argument from a purely practical position of course and has nothing to do with holy laws or morality--though those can also be made in relation to the law. We don't live in a Nazi state because the resulting security would be useless in this sort of prison world and we would be at just as much risk of being arbitrarily picked up by the thought police and never seen again as being robbed or murdered in a democracy. <br>
<br>
Who do you trust more? Who decides these harsh laws? Who executes them? Who defends the accused? Who ensures there are checks and balances or that a coup won't place a madman in power?<br>

Below is a list of the countries with the most executions in 1998. The United States carried out 68 executions during this time period. <br>

<br>
I was speaking in broad terms because the post to which I was responding did so.  My knowledge of the cultural aspects of the middle east is not limited to US-perpetuated stereo-types.  I went to school with many Arab students in Switzerland -- not Arab Americans, but Arabs who were still citizens of their homelands and whose parents served as diplomats from various Middle Eastern countries.  I heard them speak firsthand (sometimes proudly, sometimes disparagingly) of their countrys' lack of social welfare and alacritous use of the death penalty.  <br>
<br>
My point was that there are other countries who manage to control crime without abandonning what I would consider basic civil/human rights.<br>

My reference was to Simpleton, not you.  And Stacey, I’d be interested in how those numbers broke down per capita.  If the congo is killing more people than us, I find it more statisticly significant than say if China were (but not 10 times as much, which they are).  What percent of the population is being killed?  <br>
<br>
As a side question, which of them have rights to bear arms? <p>DBC67<br>

Stacy --  The population of Egypt (for example) is roughly 70 million; ours is four times that.  Stastically, execution is more prevalent there.  Don't get me wrong -- I'm hardly painting us as the eternal good-guys here. . . but I don't think we need to emulate the middle eastern judicial system in an attempt to fix what's wrong with ours.<br>
<br>
Also, those statistics don't reflect the prevalence of corporal punishment, such as lashings and maimings, and don't state what constitutes a capital offense in any of those countries.  <br>

And I agree and have been with both you Jen and DBC. I too was referring to Simpleton's post and while I admit there are other horrible punishments we would consider &quot;cruel and unusual&quot;, I think to stereotype a system may be just as much an error as trying to emulate that barbaric sterotype whether it's accurate or not.<br>
<br>
DBC--I'd have to research more to find out the right to bear arms in each country, but certainly American love our guns more than most. I do not think the average Chinese citizen can carry, nor do I think arming ourselves is what ensures our civil liberties. In fact, though I'm not for outlawing guns, it seems those most vehemently hugging their semi-automatics and making that type of argument are also gathering on ranches in Montana and Idaho and ceding from the union!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
If someone were to ask me would I like to have a legal system like what they have in any Middle Eastern country, I'd say no.. if they asked me if I'd like to live under the Shariah in the context of a proper Islamic state (i.e., Caliphate) I'd say yes.<br>
<br>
The problem with most of the countries over there is that they have stagnated from a fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) standpoint.  They use as precendent events and rulings from centuries ago, which personally I (and many other actual scholars) think is wrong, but the Muslim world as a whole has become so sheepish.. I don't know if it's fear, or culturalism, or what, but they feel so threatened when you talk about reinterpreting Islamic law to fit our world... even in the years after the death of Prophet Muhammad, the Caliphs would &quot;adjust&quot; the rulings to suit the situation, for example the Caliph Umar, who is considered the second of the &quot;Rightly Guided&quot; caliphs, suspended the whole cutting of the hand for stealing because of a paucity in foodstuffs and enduring hardship -- it's ridiculous to impose that ruling when people are struggling to survive.  These days if anyone made that kind of suggestion some Mullah somewhere would issue a fatwa calling for his/her head.<br>
<br>
Some of these things are so ingrained in people, they just can't let it go.  I'm a big stickler for women's rights in Islam, and I even have to fight my own Muslim sisters on many issues.. many who are brought up overseas are so cemented in their positions, if you try to shift them -- even when it is advocated by the Shari'ah -- you get called a Western feminist trying to infiltrate Islam.. it's pathetic.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that goes a bit off topic, but in a nutshell, I wouldn't want to have the legal standards of a Middle Eastern country applied here.<br>

Wow Kate this is exactly what the guy on BookTV was saying about Islam needing to be able to adjust with the times the way Judaism and Xianity have. I can't remember if it was more of an argument for social and political progress in these countries or about the survival of Islam (sort of like the reed--if you can't bend you'll break thing), but he seemed to feel strongly that these voices of scholars like your own will only get their proper audience and acceptance in the Muslim world in a more democratic government and society. <br>
<br>
I wish you luck in your fights for women too--there are many, many modern Islamic women I know who are with you in the Middle East who I understand wear high fashion (sorry brain fart on the proper name) scarves more to show their pride in and dedication to their religion than submission and humility. I think that's very misunderstood in this country too. Great BookTV session from an Islamic woman on this too but dang if I can remember her name either.<br>

<br>
Well I think part of the issue here is to maintain the level of trueness to Islam.. Adjust, yes, but within parameters.  Some may fear a total loss of Islam to &quot;progress&quot;, but I think we really need to re-think ourselves.. not to &quot;change the law&quot; but to use the law as it was intended -- a fluid structure that shifts and molds to suit any environment.  We want to avoid what we perceive as having happened to the Christian and Jewish communities, which is a gradual moving away from the fundamental belief in the Oneness of God (and all that entails, which is substantial) and our submission to Him.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of Muslims have bought into this whole western = modern = better.  We constantly feel this need to define ourselves according to the west, or to justify/defend ourselves according to the western models of faith, economics, political structure, etc.  What we need to do is gain confidence in ourselves, and think outside the box.  A really thought-provoking book I read on these issues recently is by Tariq Ramadan called &quot;Islam, the West and the Challenges of Modernity&quot;.  An intellectual read, but very good I thought.<br>

So we should all become criminals?  Or barbarics, at the very least?  Do we even need a criminal justice system to implement your plan, or should we just sanction lynch mobs and let them have at it?<br>

Those don't count private executions that are allowed.  Many women in Saudi Arabia are executed by family members, and that wouldn't be included in the statistics.  Also, most of the girls there only have their births documented if they are born in a hospital.  If a girl is born at home, and then she is executed by her father, then she would have never existed in the legal sense.  China also kills a lot of girl babies.  That isn't necessarily an execution, but if they are killing the girl babies, then it kind of makes you wonder if other girls are getting executed as well.  Also, some of these countries never give any type of a fair trial before execution.  One can argue that about the US, but we at least have a system in place, as weak as it may be in some cases.  One of the Palestinian Authority executions was based off of the woman's son's confession, but his confession was under duress, and after his mother was executed, he came out and said she was innocent.  It was a quick process.  A lot of countries lack the right to a fair trial, and in addition to the execution of innocents, there are many people sitting in jail for long periods of time over minor offenses.  Our country has a system that is far from perfect, but I do still feel it is one of the best.  <br>
<br>
BTW, I think the concept of modernizing Islam is an interesting one.  I think I understand why Muslims feel that Christianity and Judaism are not the best role models for modernization.  I suppose that when your life is too secularized with modern day advances, then it is easy to forget about the roots of your religion.  I am currently reading a book written by an Orthodox rabbi(yes, a far cry from the Shermer book I just read), and in his chapter on idolatry he discusses how people are pretty much focusing on objects and achievements and getting away from spirituality and feeling one with God.  I don't share his views on God and religion, but I do find the concept interesting.  Many Orthodox Jews feel the same way about modernizing as Muslims do, and that is why you could usually spot one a mile away.  I do think that the Middle Eastern societies need a huge overhaul right now, but it would be nice if the overhaul could occur while sticking to the roots of their culture.  Islam was the most prosperous culture at one point in time, and they were able to do so without compromising their faith.  I guess that in all this rambling I should just ask Kate, or anyone else who might know, if Muslims are looking back to this prosperous time to see how they could modernize for the future without compromising their religion?  Of course, that might be a topic for another thread...<br>
