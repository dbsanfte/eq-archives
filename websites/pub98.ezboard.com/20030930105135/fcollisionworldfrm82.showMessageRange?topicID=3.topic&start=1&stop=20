It took over 10 years to complete.  It was a beautiful and spactactlular touring area until the war broke out.  Now, the whole city is almost a military base, having only a few thousand civilians.  The whole thing is slightly larger than the size of modern day (2003, or whatever,) New York City.  It has two levels.   On each side, there were huge pillars, filled with AA (Anti Aircraft) Anti-Personel, and Anti-Sea turrets.  To the side of that, were simple man controlled turrets, for better accuracy. (In some cases.)  There are tall skyscrapers everywhere, and is out in the middle of nowhere. <p>------<br>

Most of the Factions are giving up...&quot; Hoffman, Mike's right-hand man pointed out.  &quot;Yeah, we'll show 'em up though.&quot; Lester shot back, throwing a punch in the air, at nobody in particular.  &quot;Yeah.  My machine gun can answer for that one!&quot; Hoffman said.<br>
<br>
Mike and Hoffman walked into the Food Hall, there were several other soldiers/pilots there.  They grabbed their trays and sat down at a vacant table.  &quot;So, boss, where've you been?&quot; Hoffman asked, swallowing a piece of food.  &quot;Oh you know, the usual, just finishing up some mercenary work..and don't call me boss. You know that..&quot;he responded.  &quot;Oh, sorry.&quot; Hoffman said, taking a sip from the glass of water.  &quot;So, whaddya think Hiria is gonna do with us?&quot; Hoffman asked again.  &quot;Well, they definitly aren't gonna let us stay,  we're one of the strongest Factions, along with the Mutaku Faction.&quot;  &quot;Didn't the Mutaku Faction fall apart?&quot;  &quot;More like weakened. Their pretty prominent though.  I hear they went into hiding after Munisha joined Lus.&quot; Mike replied, finishing off one of his courses.  &quot;Well, I can't wait to test out the new Mechs they got us.&quot; Hoffman said.  &quot;Those aren't mechs.   Those are Moble Suits.  They're more expensive, and slightly better than standards.&quot;  &quot;Oh, cool.&quot; Hoffman said, finishing off his meal.<br>
<br>
Soon they were outside again, and they were back in the hangar. <br>
&quot;I wonder where Lester and Tony went off to?&quot; Hoffman asked, hands in his pockets.  &quot;Gah, they're probably off chatting with the others.&quot; Mike said, continuing towards the hangar.  &quot;Hey, you wanna leave base for a bit?&quot; Mike asked Hoffman.  &quot;Would I? Of course!  Getting of this 'island' has always been cool.  But shouldn't we ask?&quot;  &quot;Nah..&quot; Mike said, waving his hand downward.  &quot;I'll just say I was takin you along on a mission when we get back.&quot; he said, climbing into his custom MS.  Hoffman climbed into climbing into the new MS they had received.<br>
<br>
Soon, they were off toward the mainland... <p>------<br>

More countries and rebel Factions had surrendered, and only a handful remained.  &quot;Hmmm..&quot; Hoffman said, watching the TV some more.  <br>
Suddenly, there was a huge explosion type noise, and shortly after some sirens were going off.<br>
&quot;Warning, unidentified terrorists have bombed the Capital building, requesting Military assistance.&quot;<br>
Mike was done listening to the announcement, he was already in his Suit.  &quot;Well, what are you waiting for?!&quot; he cried, powering it up. <br>
It didn't take Hoffman too long to scramble into his Suit, and they made their way to the Capital building.<br>
<br>
As they were walking, Mike saw a laser beam barely miss his suit.  &quot;Whoa!&quot; he shouted, peering to his left.  There was a suit, accompanied by a dozen troops.  &quot;Central Command, I got a suit, and some troops here, can't identify! Over!&quot; he said, firing at the suit.  But it was faster, it dodged out of the way.  Hoffman was already in the firefight with the troops.  They had some sort of advanced machine guns...<br>
Mike fired a volley from his machine gun, blowing the head off of the Suit.  It's camera was out, but it continued to fight.  &quot;Darnit..&quot; he said, reloading a magazine onto the massive weapon.  It got a shot off, bouncing off the Suits knee.  &quot;Hah, thats the end of you!&quot; he said, firing at the Mechs cockpit, an explosion following.  Hoffman was done finishing off the troops.<br>
&quot;What the..&quot; he asked.. <p>------<br>

Mike turned the torso of his Moble Suit that direction, and there were two Suits, each were customs, but the same custom model.  They had a special emblem on the armored plate on their shoulder. ACE.  &quot;ACE!!&quot; Mike said as he read the word.  A million thoughts ran through his head.  Mike, had previously been an ACE pilot himself, and knew their special talents in various mecha.  &quot;Hoffman, be careful, these are ACE's!  Special Pilots, do NOT underestimate them!&quot; he said.  Just then, the one on the right, drew his beam sword and charged at Hoffman, slicing into its arm.  Hoffman's suit's left arm was cut off at the elbow.  &quot;Geez!&quot; he said, instantly jumping back, unleashing a hurl of bullets at the ACE.  The ACE, anticipating, dodged to the left, and charged again, cutting off the whole left arm this time.  &quot;Mike! I co-&quot; he said, noticing he was already engaged.  &quot;I gotta take him on myself?!&quot; he said, feeling insignificant compared to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lets go then.&quot; he said, gaining his confidence back.  He unleashed some more bullets, instantly charging after wards, trying to ram the enemy with his side.  The ACE knew better, and simply backed up, after dodging the bullets to the right.  &quot;Gah, he's fast!  Those aren't any ordinary Suits...&quot; he commented.  &quot;Of course not, those are ACE customs, built specificly for their type of combat.  Lucky you, you got a speed ACE!&quot; Mike pointed out.  &quot;Just wait, until you get an All-Round ACE...&quot; he said, going back into battle.  &quot;Great...&quot; Hoffman added.  He charged again, this time successfully landing a hit.  But, the ACE fired a beam cannon, while he was up close, badly damaging his upper right leg.  &quot;Critical hit, upper right leg.&quot; the computer pointed out.  &quot;I know!&quot; he said, unleashing some bullets while jumping back.  Aparently, the ACE took the hits, firing again.  Miss.  &quot;Thank you God!&quot; he said, happy he missed, and fired a volley of bullets, aimed at his left leg.  Hit.  &quot;I'm on a roll!&quot; he said, side jumping to the right.  He fired again.  Hit.  But he was out of ammo.  The ACE responded, charging at him.  &quot;Damn, he was waiting for that!&quot; he said.  He backed up, and chucked the gun at him, tearing into the ACE's cockpit.  Explosion, the ACE was defeated.  <br>
<br>
Mike was on a roll also.  He had the ACE cornered, and aimed for the ACE.  Fire, explosion, the other ACE was defeated.  &quot;Phew...&quot; Hoffman said.  &quot;Yeah...&quot; Mike said, sitting back in the cockpit.  He soon straightened up.  &quot;C'mon, we gotta get to the capital building!&quot; he said, walking his suit forward.  &quot;Wait up!&quot; Hoffman replied, knowing his own Suit was damaged near the joint, but it was walkable. <p>------<br>

His mouth was open, his head turned up.  He walked up to one of the command posts on the synthetic island.  &quot;Soon,  the flower will be in full bloom, and you, nobody, can escape.&quot;  he said, his eyes were wide open.  <br>
<br>
&quot;What the heck?!&quot; A Xusus Pilot asked, looking over to Seric's Moble Suit.  &quot;Its....&quot; he said, staring at it.  &quot;Die!!&quot; Seric shouted into the microphone.  Seric's suit charged to the suit, and the pilot was stunned.  The beam sword cut the torso in half, an explosion following.  &quot;Central Command, Battlion 83 here, I have identified a Moble Suit, it's emblem belongs to Hiria!&quot; he shouted, just before a beam ripped through the cockpit.  &quot;Hahahaha!!&quot; Seric laughed, stepping on 2 ground troops.  The screams filled his ears.  &quot;The chaos...&quot; he said, letting his suit just stand there.  Gunfire and explosions were heard throughout the city.  &quot;...its....beautiful!!&quot; he shouted.  Looking forward, toward a command tower, he ran toward it.  He drew his beam rifle, and charged it.  &quot;Muahahaha!!&quot; he continued to laugh manicly.  At full charge, he released, blowing the bottom portion off.  The top part crumbled, falling to the ground with an explosion.  <br>
<br>
Seric walked out of the explosion.  More ground troops awaited him.  &quot;So..you desire to die?&quot; he said.  &quot;Suit yourself, heh..heh...hahaha!&quot; he said, runing over to them.  He stepped on another 3 of them, then jumping into the air, he let himself fall close to the ground, and propelled himself up with his jets, burning the troops to cinders.  &quot;The bloodlust...its wonderful.&quot; he said, flying to the top of a skyscraper.  He pointed his beam rifle down, charging it again.  &quot;For Chaos!&quot; he shouted, releasing at full charge.  The beam ripped through the skyscrapper, explosions followed at each floor, going downward to the ground.  As it began to crumble, Seric rode it to the bottom.  &quot;Who's next?&quot; he shouted into the com receiver, pointed at anyone on the island. <p>------<br>

When I get home, people'll ask me, &quot;Hey Hoot, why do ya do it man? Why? Just some war junkie?&quot;  Ya know what I'll say?  I won't say a goddamn word.  Why?  They won't understand.  They won't understand why we do it.  They won't understand that it's about the men next to you, and thats it.  That's all it is.    -- Delta Sgt. First Class Norman &quot;Hoot&quot; Gibson, from Black Hawk Down<br>
