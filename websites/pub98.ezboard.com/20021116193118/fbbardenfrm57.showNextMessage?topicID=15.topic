I wanted to know what you all think about where people misinterpret song lyrics? One example that REALLY has irritated me is about when Ozzy Osbourne was sued over his song &quot;Suicide Solution&quot;. <br>
<br>
He had been sued by a family whose son had killed himself, &amp; he was listening to Ozzy's album &quot;Blizzard Of Ozz&quot;, which &quot;Suicide Solution&quot; is on. They blamed Ozzy's song was the reason their son killed himself, &amp; the attorney representing the family said he saw a very clear case of someone assisting another to commit suicide.<br>
<br>
In truth, this song was written about the late Bon Scott from AC/DC, he had drinken himself to death. It is NOT a pro-suicide song. In the end, the case was thrown out of court. Ozzy was sued 2 more times on the song, but those cases never made it to trial. Ozzy even said why should he stop singing a song that he knows what he wrote it for? I feel Ozzy should not have been sued at all.<br>
<br>
They won't play the song on the radio, I had requested it once but they told me they couldn't play it due to the subject matter.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm wondering if you all could please tell me what you think of the lyrics &amp; this subject overall. Dash, if you feel these lyrics should be edited out, &amp;/or if the thread title should be changed, I totally understand. Thanks, man. Here are the lyrics:<br>
<br>
&quot;Suicide Solution&quot; (Words &amp; Music by John Osbourne, Robert Daisley, &amp; Randy Rhoads)<br>
<br>
&quot;Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker, suicide is slow with liquor.<br>
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows, then it floods away tomorrows, away tomorrows.<br>
<br>
Evil thoughts and evil doings, cold alone you hang in ruins.<br>
Thought that you'd escape the reaper, you can't escape the master keeper 'cause you feel life's unreal and you're living a lie. Such a shame, who's to blame and you're wondering why. Then you ask from your cask is there life after birth? What you sow can mean hell on this earth, hell on this earth.<br>
<br>
Now you live inside a bottle, the reaper's travelling at full throttle. It's getting you but you don't see it. The reaper's you and the reaper is me.<br>
<br>
Breaking laws, knockin' doors but there's no one at home. Made your bed, rest your head, but you lie there and moan. Where to hide suicide is the only way out. Don't you know what it's really about?<br>
<br>
I know people, you really know where it's at. You gotta get the flags out! You gotta get the flags out! Alright!<br>
<br>
Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker, suicide is slow with liquor.<br>
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows, then it floods away tomorrows.<br>
<br>
Take me away tomorrow. You never give me rest, no first, no first, no day.<br>
<br>
Take me away. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. (2X)&quot;<br>
<br>

I hope this isn't edited, because I see nothing wrong with the thread or the song for that matter.<br>
<br>
I have never heard this song before, but the lyrics are clear, IMO.<br>
<br>
The lawsuit was probably a way for the parents to make some sense of what had happened, and try to cast the finger of blame somewhere.  I think it was likely a misguided method of trying to heal and resolve their confusion.<br>
<br>
Compared to popular music today, this song is downright tame.  Hard to image a time when THIS was considered scandalous.   <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#200985><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/ustarryeyed4paul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StarryEyed4Paul</A> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/f_a_y/paul4judy_pp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Ticklebunny<br />Profile Assistant<br /><img src='http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-admin.gif' /></span><br>  Posts: <b>4462</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#99CCFF>Posted: 8/21/02 7:19:39 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: Misinterpreting songs/song lyrics</span><hr size=1> Hello, kapooku, this isn't edited at all. &quot;Suicide Solution&quot;/the album &quot;Blizzard Of Ozz&quot; had come out in the early 80's.

<br>
There's a fine line I think between using art of any description to represent your emotions or tell a tale, and using controversial imagery to sell products.<br>
<br>
I haven't heard about the lawsuits - but yes, it's probably just a way of dealing with the trauma of their son's suicide, perhaps to pass the blame onto someone else.<br>
<br>
Eminem has had it recently with a few of his songs(stan notably). The question is... when does it go from being a work of art, to a strong negative influence on teenagers?  Ozzy is a role model to many people - he affects peoples lives.<br>
<br>
This moves on to a wider issue of censorship of any creative art(quite fitting eh? Good topic Starry). Be it film, music, poetry or writings. When does the stuff become so controversial that it is unsuitable for release into the public domain?<br>
<br>
Hope you don't mind me asking a further few questions Starry. Good topic indeed!<br>

People would not be buying this music if they didn't relate to it on a certain level. Which means that those violent impulses were already there, the music one listens to is usually only an expression of those already present feelings. Someone extremely happy-go-lucky will not just go out and buy tons of Slipknot, Hocico, or Marilyn Manson CD's, generally.<br>
<br>
Artists should be able to express their views however they want to. If people are smart enough to teach their children not to take this stuff literally, this wouldn't be happening. An artist is not responsible for someone else's poor choice, people just happen to blame it on the music, saying it's a &quot;bad influence&quot;. Well if kids today were intelligent and rational enough to not allow music to rule their lives, this wouldn't be an issue. These people are grasping at everything other than themselves to blame. And the questioning of an artist's freedom of speech is often the cost.<br>
<br>
Do you remember the Columbine High shootings and all that in the U.S. a while back? And that huge issue of them listening to Marilyn Manson, and they thought that was what provoked the teens to violence? Isn't it reasonable to ask the question.. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Where the heck were the parents?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I mean these kids were handling guns, and making bombs, and planning this out to the last detail. Why do we blame the music they listen to and not the bullies who teased them and pushed them to the edge? Or the parents who should have taught them that violence was not an answer? It's ludicrous. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003399><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/ucandykiddie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Candy Kiddie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www.number1alien.com/images/number1alien.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Resident Swede<br />Promotions Editor<br /><img src='http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-vip.gif' /></span><br>  Posts: <b>1149</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#99CCFF>Posted: 8/22/02 10:26:56 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: Misinterpreting songs/song lyrics</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Someone extremely happy-go-lucky will not just go out and buy tons of Slipknot, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Hocico</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, or Marilyn Manson CD's, generally.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

If someone wants to listen to miserable songs that make them want to kill themselves they can, but don't blame the author.
