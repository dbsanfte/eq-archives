On the abortion issue, I am still very torn. Personally, I do not think I could ever do it, but I have never been a situation that calls for it. (And I hope I never am). I can see it it certain situations (13yo girl is raped by father for example... or anyone who is raped for that matter), but as a form of &quot;Birth Control&quot; I strongly disagree. I have been told that that makes me prochoice, but in my own head, I am not sure.<br>

<br>
Until a fetus is viable outside of the womb I feel its a potential life. At the point where it can live outside the womb (what is it now adays, about 24 weeks?) I don't think abortions should be allowed, EXCEPT for medically necessary abortions. <br>
<br>
While I was sweating that af when I was raped my mind followed all kinds of possibilites. I didn't think I could do it, but I thought about it. I had the year before was there to listen to a friend who had casual careless sex, took the morning after pill, and still ended up pregnant. And while I probably couldn't have done it, I don't think I could have mentally survived that 9 months. Especially knowing now that I hate being pregnant. I had suffered from depression the year before and was really just getting my life back together. OK, thankfully I didn't have to make this choice. But it was an option that I legally had. <br>
<br>
My sister has had an abortion. She had it done the month before we called to announce we were pregnant with our second child. I am the only family member to know. She and I talked long about it. She knew we were in themiddle of trying to get pregnant. I knew when I came home that she was in trouble. She was just 19. She asked me what she should do. I told her I couldn't answer that, I wasn't her. But no matter her choice I was there 100% with her. I wish duties with the ILS hadn't prevented me from being the one to take her. <br>
<br>
I am not sure she is dealing well with it now. But I shudder to think of what she might have done if the option hadn't been open to her. I don't think she had been at a point where she could have handled pregnancy. And our extended family I think would have pressured her to keep the child (my parents would never do that). So while I don't think she is dealing well with her choice, I think the other choices would have completely undone her at that point of time. But regardless of what I think, it was always her choice. And I firmly stand in her corner on that choice. <br>
<br>
Personal exprience, not really debatable, but this is a personal subject. And my belief its no one else's damn business.<br>

Woah that was some post. I am truly sorry you had to go through that. In some ways I'm naive. I refused all tests because I didn't want to know. If I had been in your shoes I probably would have done the same thing. That really wasn't what I ws afraid of. I was more afraid of finding out other things, downs and the like. I would have spent the next few months obsessng over it, so didn't have the tests done. But your story makes me see that I should have them done for what you did was far kinder on your child. <br>
<br>
That must have been terribly hard and difficult to share. Thank you. <br>

I am very sad you had to make that choice. I don't know what I would do in that stage of the game.It must have been an agonizing decision. That would be so hard so late in your pregnancy. <br>
 I am very pro-choice. I think it is a personal decision and nobodys business. I think if you are pro-life then don't have an abortion.<br>
People always say that adoption is the best route. Except it isn't if your not white and healthy. The majority of babies adopted are white babies.  Babies with health defects have an extremely hard time getting adopted. What happens to those kids?<br>
To all the pro-lifers do have any adopted children? If not then why didn't you choose to help your cause and adopt some of the babies that people chose not to abort?<br>
I dont know if i am making any sense. I am having PG brain damage right know.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have seen friends on both sides. Recently I had a friend whose baby was diagnosed with anencephaly. She induced at 23 weeks and the baby died 2 hours after birth. It was a very painful experience. I have a friend right now carrying to term a baby with the same diagnosis. Part of why she decided to carry is because if they induced and the baby didn't die right away, they were going to inject potassiam something into the baby's heart, and she just couldn't do it.<br>
<br>
I don't think it accomplishes anything to make a woman carry to term if her life is in danger. But, I wish there were stricter laws on abortion, such as making it legal on the cases of rape, incest or the mothers life is in danger. <p>Paige<br>

As you can tell I have thought about the abortion issue a LOT. I actually tried to refuse testing, but my OB insisted on the level 2 ultrasound because I was 35 at the time. I didn't want an amnio, but after discovering the severe heart defects the fetal specialist strongly recommended it. <br>
<br>
Before the amnio results came in, we were planning to go to term in the hope that the baby could have a transplant (could not have survived with the heart he had - 2 chambers, no septums, malformed valves, etc.) Then the amnio came back T-21 in every cell (Downs) which actually, without the heart defects we might have continued - it's hard to say for sure without having been in that situation. But they told us they don't give donor hearts to Downs babies. Sad, isn't it? <br>
<br>
I think I have really come to terms with the whole situation (it'll be three years next month.) But I can still get worked up over the topic.  This is a decision for families, not lawmakers. <br>

Thanks for your kind words. I am sorry your friend had to go through this and I think it says a lot about you that you put aside your pro-life feelings and supported her during what I know is a very tough time. I'm sure your other friend has her reasons for going to term and she has every right to make that choice.<br>
<br>
However, I do have to challenge you on something. You said &quot;I wish there were stricter laws on abortion, such as making it legal on the cases of rape, incest or the mothers life is in danger.&quot; <br>
<br>
Abortion is legal in these case now. But as a pro-lifer who wants abortion outlawed, why do you value these exceptions? Is the fetus less human or less valuable in these cases? Or is it because these cases present too much of a hardship for the mother? <br>
<br>
If it's about hardship, what about a mother who already has more children than she can support, or will be on bedrest the entire pregnancy, or will lose her job or whose marriage will crumble, or will be suicidal because she can't take her anti-depression meds or is very young and not ready for motherhood or the trauma of giving a baby away? (I could NEVER give a baby away, could you? How can we force this on teens?) Are these not undue hardships? Do you really want lawmakers making one-size-fits-all decisions about what constitutes hardship pregnancy?<br>
<br>
If it's not hardship that concerns you, is it that in these cases the woman did not choose sex? If so, then aren't you saying that pregnancy is a just punishment for sex? I hear pro-lifers (usually males) saying &quot;she shoulda kept her legs crossed if she didn't want a kid.&quot; Last night on Donahue, Phillis Schaffly said &quot;I didn't get them pregnant!&quot; So, if women who &quot;choose&quot; sex and have a birth control failure, or even get caught up in the moment and end up PG, are to be punished by pregnancy, what about the GUY? Should he be let off the hook? Why can't we throw him in the slammer or at least have him castrated?<br>
<br>
If any of your answers have to do with &quot;what god wants&quot; then please also explain how that fits in with separation of church and state?<br>
<br>
Paige, you seem like a very nice lady so don't take this post as mean spirited. I just want you to think these issues through all the way to the back before you throw your support behind truncating women's rights.  <br>

I really hate that term!<br>
<br>
I think that no matter what system we have, there are and will be flaws and someone is going to get a raw deal. It may be the baby or it may be the mother.<br>
<br>
I know that it is legal in the cases I stated. I do wish is was more restrictive. It's such a complicated thing. As a religious person, I know God cherishes these little ones. But I also know that he gives us free agency. I wish neither was compromised!<br>
<br>
In cases of the mothers health and such, no, the fetus is no less life or valuble. But, if the mother were to die, I think &quot;What good would that do?&quot; The fetus would then die also.<br>
<br>
As far as hardships....part of being a mother is putting your child first. If you were not able to care for that child, though it might be painful for the mother, she would need to think of her child first. I still think adoption is better than killing the child because you couldn't deal with giving it away. How is THAT a better deal for the child????? We have friends that adopted a beautiful baby girl last year. I see the thrill they have with her and how her FOUR big brothers adore her. That baby has a WONDERFUL life. The mother was 20, unwed and not prepared to mother. She gave the baby and that family a wonderful gift. I have a friend from HS that gave her baby up. We were out of HS and she was married, but it was turning into an abusive relationship. She did a selfless thing by setting HER feelings aside and doing the best she could for her child.<br>

I am pro-choice, as I stated below.  This doesn't mean that I take abortion lightly, or that I would choose it for myself, except maybe for extenuating circumstances.  Actually, I can't really say for sure which situations I would or wouldn't have an abortion because I am not in those situations, and neither are the lawmakers that want to outlaw Roe v Wade.  I have never been raped, I have never been pg with an unhealthy baby (unless you count my miscarriage) and I didn't get into trouble as a teenager.  I am very fortunate, but just because I've been fortunate, that doesn't mean that I have the right to force other women to give birth.<br>
<br>
I have heard people say that abortion should only be legal in cases of rape or medical necessity.  Well, my question is:  how do we know when these instances have occurred?  Take rape for instance.  At what point does the law decide a woman has been raped and allow her to abort?  Is it when she is brought into the hospital?  Do we need to wait for a conviction?  How exactly is our system supposed to monitor something like that?  Medical necessity isn't so black and white either.  There was a case in Louisiana where a woman had a health condition that would put her life in danger if she took her pg to term, and she needed state funds for the abortion.  The state turned her down because the doctor said there was a 50-50 chance of survival, and the court determined that the risk of death wasn't high enough to give her the funds for the abortion.  I don't know what ended up happening to the woman, but I don't want lawmakers playing Russian Roulette with my life like that.  <br>
<br>
I also take issue when people condemn women who weren't raped or who don't have medical issues.  We have so many unwanted children in this world who are hungry and lacking proper care.  Why bring more unwanted children into this?  Yes, people should be careful and behave responsibly when it comes to sex, but sex is a natural urge, and people sometimes make mistakes.  Our law would allow a 15 year old to get out of a written contract because her age makes her incompetent to take on such a responsibility.  Yet we want this same 15 year old girl to become a parent?  Why is she too immature to take responsibility for a car loan, but not a child?  <br>
<br>
Then there is the adoption issue.  I really do respect women who make that selfless decision, but it isn't practical for everyone.  I won't even get into the emotional aspects of it.  I'll just stick with the practical aspects of it since that is the only thing lawmakers seem to understand.  Who is going to pay for this girl's prenatal care?  Who is going to pay her rent when she has to keep leaving work to go to doctor's appointments?  What if she needs bed rest?  Who is going to pay to feed this woman while spending 8 weeks in bed?  A woman's body is not just a baby vending machine.  <br>
<br>
Now I know this all boils down to when life actually starts.  I admit that I felt a bond with both my babies right away.   I mourned the baby I miscarried for a long time, and I lost that baby at 11 weeks.  The baby just never formed, so I know there was no suffering or anything, but I felt attached to that baby anyway.  However, even in the case of my son who was and is a healthy boy, during early pregnancy the baby is just a mass of cells.  It is more in our minds because when we envision having a baby, we are envisioning a full-term baby, and not a mass of cells.  When a baby is still a mass of cells, they aren't going to know what is going on.  So yes, it is a life, but there are just certain cases where that baby might be better off being put out of their misery before they could think or feel.  I don't agree with late-term abortions unless there are medical reasons because I believe at that stage babies could think and feel.  While Clinton was in office the Dems tried to put a law on the books that would disallow late-term abortion unless there are medical reasons.  However, the Reps wouldn't allow it because a law like that would allow abortion in general, and if they don't want laws with any wording that would allow abortion at all.  There is a constant war between both parties because any law surrounding abortion would undermine the goals of the other side.  This is all the more reason why the decision needs to be kept with the person directly involved, the woman.<br>

Someone earlier said pro-choice was pro-abortion and I disagree.  I don’t think it is any of my damn business what you choose to do with your life, your body or your family planning.  I agree that a fetus once viable should not be aborted.  After 25 weeks it can be delivered and turned over for adoption if the mother doesn’t want it.  I disagree that it is the responsibility of our government to restrict people’s legal rights over your arbitrary values, morals or ethics.  Something that gets glossed over in these discussions is the mother’s rights.  You argue that the rights of the baby in cases of rape, incest or other violent sex offenses are somehow less than those of babies conceived by bad planning or just rotten luck.  This ‘evil’ conceptions are abortable while the ‘dumb mom’ ones are not.  What about the woman’s rights?  Are hers less than those of the fetus?  This is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>slavery</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to force her to carry it if she doesn’t want to.  What if the risk to her life is only 20% instead of 80%, does she not have a right?  What if it is 1%?  I am not saying it is an easy decision.  I am not saying it is one I would EVER want to face or that people who face it will have an easy time.  It is terrible, and it is none of my business or yours.  You argue for free agency of gods minions, taking this choice away robs them of that freedom to choose and you are violating your own gods law.  This is the same as China saying their people cannot have more than one kid or Nazi Germany saying the blonde white women had to have as many as possible.

How can you talk about this beautiful, selfless sacrifice and then turn around and say women must be forced to do this? There is no beauty or love in being forced to continue an unwanted pregnancy against your will.  <br>
<br>
Many girls who go to term do not have the maturity to give the baby away, nor the maturity to raise it selflessly. So you end up with a lot of kids abused, in foster care, extreme poverty, etc. The world doesn't need more human suffering, but ultimately THAT is what pro-life brings about. When women don't have choices, children suffer. I don't think people should have any more children than they can emotionally afford to raise - and when they do, their children are the ones who suffer.<br>
<br>
Also, you asked &quot;How is THAT (abortion) a better deal for the child?????&quot; Well, do you not know that about HALF of all abortions are performed on children, that is girls under the age of 18? And half of those girls are age 15 or less? And that in the majority of cases, a man OVER the age of 18 got them pregnant? So my pro-choice stance is very much about protecting children, that is, girls, from the hardship of pregnancy and motherhood. You did not answer my question about why men get to have their jollies and walk away scott-free; and go knock up the next air-head they find.)<br>
<br>
&quot;I know God cherishes these little ones&quot;<br>
<br>
How do you know? The bible is dead silent on the subject of elective abortion.<br>
<br>
You did not answer most of the questions from my previous post, and you included what &quot;god&quot; wants and your musings about how &quot;god&quot; feels without explaining how this fits in with SOCAS. <br>
<br>
I'd like to know how do you feel about unmarried women and girls under 18 having access to birth control? I'm curious.<br>

A law stating only rape incest etc is also a violation to the woman all over again because then the burdon of proof that she was rape is on her. Hell when I was raped I had no signs. I wasn't beaten, or drugged, I didn't physically fight him - I was terrified out of my skull. And then I stupidly went home and took a scalding hot bath. It was all I could think about. Scrubbing it off of me. So I would have had no proof I had been raped. I made mistakes that night that I could easily see being turned back against me and forcing me to carry a child if such a law was put in place. It would be degrading and humilating all over again. I would rather it be legal and safer then a back alley dirty doctor.<br>

It is not recognized in any other legal way as a child or life and a beating heart does not a human make. The others are making arguments as well as I could so I'll leave it at that, but let's at least be consistent here-- <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think it accomplishes anything to make a woman carry to term if her life is in danger. But, I wish there were stricter laws on abortion, such as making it legal on the cases of rape, incest or the mothers life is in danger.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you are pro-life and you believe that life begins at conception then how the conception occurred is irrelevant. Do you feel a fertilized egg resulting from rape is less human or less worthy of life? If so, you cannot argue that life begins at conception or that abortion is murder unless you want to concede it is okay to murder an innocent if it resulted from rape or incest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, if you would force every pregnancy to term then stop overpopulating the planet with litters of children when there are thousands wasting away all over the world in orphanages. And I'm not talking just cutsy babies here--I'm talking older children who need a place to live, be loved, fed, clothed....heck even saved if that's what you're after. Let's care for the spirit babies already suffering before we keep shooting out more thanks very much.<br>
<br>
Again--I am pro-choice and don't believe human life begins at conception or that we have souls or that a woman should be forced to carry a child. That said--I agree with Stacey that this is not taken lightly. Both sides like to use extremes, but the fact is women are not having tons of abortions casually in their 3rd trimester, nor is it a pleasant experience we use as a thoughtless option to condoms or the pill. <br>
<br>
Take this away from women again and you erode reproductive control so essential to our freedom and the growth of society and the planet in general. Can some of these folks pumping out 6 or 9 kids please adopt those already born and languishing in the world?? <br>

<br>
i had an abortion.  i think what i did can be considered a selfless act.  I DID NOT WANT TO HAVE THE ABORTION.  however, i was emotionally unstable at the time of conception and logically came to the conclusion that if i allowed the pregnancy to continue i would be doing the unborn baby, myself, my boyfriend and my 2 living breathing children a HUGE disservice(of course he played a role in 'our' decision, but ultimately, as he put it &quot;its my choice&quot;).  if i had allowed the pregnancy continue there is a HUGE probability that i would have become abusive (since i am already at risk to become abusive, i was abused severely as a child. im trying to break this cycle, not perpetuate it).  i would have become neglectful and overwhelmed.  i feel that i made the most compassionate CHOICE that i could.  adoption was not an option, there is no way i would ever give a baby away, especially since technically i did want that baby.  my mass of cells was only approx 12 days gest., so i guess there was no heart beat and that exempts me from that argument.<br>
<br>
i am now pregnant with my 3rd child, this was planned.  i feel great about this pregnancy, there is no feeling of dread or being overwhelmed or detatchment.  i feel i am emotionally ready for this.  it is totally different than how i felt before, but it doesnt mean that this potential child is any 'more' wanted or loved than the last.  i still greive for my lost baby and i still ocasionally feel sorry for myself, that i had to make that choice,  but i do not regret my decision because i know that i made the best choice for all parties involved.  sometimes doing the best for your family and yourself is harder. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Double Latte</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(1/9/03 2:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  abortion</span><hr size=1> Razberiswrl,<br>
Your experience demonstrates that this is not a decision we enter into lightly or on a whim. Or out of convenience or selfishness. It is a huge decision that most women take very seriously.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you had to go through it though, I know it's hard. Thanks for sharing, now I don't feel like the only one here who's had one.<br>
<br>
Paige, <br>
You've mentioned &quot;life of the mother&quot; now a couple of times. I can't think of any other medical condition where doctors wait until the your life is in eminent danger before saving you. I know a lady whose mom had an abortion because she had cancer and couldn't have chemotherapy while pregnant. Sometimes adoption is not an option.<br>

Mental health of the woman is an important thing to consider. <br>
<br>
Which is why I do think my sister made the best choice for her at that time. Unstable women do not make good mothers. Most of the time its just a sad case of very bad timing with the possibility of poor judgement. But I don't think a woman's life should be ruined for those reasons. And I don't think a child should be brought into this world under those circumstances. <br>
<br>
No one else walks in theses women's shoes which is why the choice MUST stay with the woman. Pregnancy is not easy, even eventless pregnancies are not easy on the woman. For someone who is already facing problems, its cruel to both the woman and the unborn child to FORCE and enslave her to YOUR moral standards. <br>

There is no way a group of lawmakers would have understood what you described.  I don't take abortion lightly either, but I did think I was going to have to face that decision when I was a teen.  I was 15 years old, and a week late.  During that week I kept thinking about how I would have an abortion if I was pg, and my boyfriend and I were already mourning this child that didn't yet exist.  Keeping this child would not have been a viable option.  His parents were abusive, and they would have beat the crap out of him.  My parents had always told me to make my own decisions, but to not come home pregnant, and if I did, then they aren't raising my child (in other words, they would have insisted on abortion).  I was too young to do anything lucrative with my life in order to support this child, and my boyfriend was only a year older than me.  Fortunately it turned out to be a false alarm, but if I would have turned out to be pg, then trying to keep that baby would have been a disaster.  I ended up breaking up with this boyfriend several months later, and started dating my dh several weeks after that.  I couldn't imagine being tied to my ex since he was an abusive jerk.  I don't even know what I was thinking since I was raised to be more responsible when it came to both sex and respect from men.  I fell in love with this guy, and it clouded my judgement.  I also wasn't premiscuous, and I was a pretty good kid overall.  Having an abortion would have been devastating to me, I especially know that now that I have experienced a miscarriage, but having that child would have been more devastating, and I wouldn't have the life I do right now, nor would that child have the advantages my son has right now.  <br>
