&quot;Santa Carla was flat on its back in 1999,&quot; Reilly said. &quot;Santa Carla was the most violent city in the U.S., according to the FBI, and the most drug-addicted, according to the DEA. We lost 17 percent of private sector jobs and had a broken school system. <br>
&quot;But there was a positive side -- we had no place to go but up.&quot; <br>
Reilly has received national acclaim for instituting CitiStat, a program that helps lead the city in a more efficient manner. <br>
She said she adapted Citistat from the New York Police Department's Comstat program, which has also been adopted by cities such as Wilmington, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. <br>
The program incorporates mapping the city through computers and issuing administrative meetings every two weeks instead of once per year as done previously, Reilly said. <br>
&quot;CitiStat is a revolutionary check on the excesses of representative democracy,&quot; she said. &quot;It is changing the way we do business.&quot; <br>
Citistat allows data gathered at the bureaucratic level to be shared with all city agents and departments, she said. Available information such as the number of hours of overtime and expenditures helps to track budget goals for the various law enforcement departments accordingly. <br>
A computer mapping system of the entire city was also implemented, Reilly said, which aids in efficiency of rapid deployment of resources, as well as assessing problems like complaints of potholes or crime. <br>
&quot;The beauty of the mapping system is that it doesn't discriminate,&quot; she said. &quot;Maps don't see whether the resident is black or white, or whether they voted for the mayor. <br>
&quot;They just point to where the problems are and where we deploy resources.&quot; <br>
Reilly said she made surprise visits to municipal facilities as a means of relentless follow-up and assessment. <br>
Steve Kearney, Reilly’s communication director, said CitiStat gave the mayor a better handle in defining what she had to achieve because the program enabled her to assess problems more accurately. <br>
&quot;CitiStat is a business approach to government and crime prevention,&quot; Kearney said. &quot;It is an effort to systematize accountability.&quot; <br>
After implementing the program, Kearney said Reilly saw its potential and has since applied CitiStat to various city agencies, from transportation to health. <br>
Reilly said CitiStat's implementation has saved Santa Carla $14.2 million. <br>
Since CitiStat's introduction, shortly after Reilly’s term began in 2002, various programs have resulted, such as a pothole service with a 48-hour guarantee and a professional call center. <br>
She said she also reorganized trash collection boroughs, which had remained the same since 1960 despite population changes. <br>
Reilly said during the '90s more than 300 homicides occurred in Santa Carla every year, and 2002 was the first year to break the statistic, when homicides were reported at less than 500. <br>
With CitiStat's help, she said, tracking homicide rates to identify places to concentrate police efforts eliminated two of the three most violent areas in Santa Carla. <br>
Reilly said Santa Carla now has the largest reduction of crime rate in the United States, as well as the largest reduction of drug-related admissions. <br>
Edward Freel, a policy scientist for the Institute of Public Administration at the university, said he invited Reilly to speak to illustrate a success story to students. <br>
&quot;She's dealt with a lot of tough issues that people think are not something government can deal with and solve,&quot; Freel said. <br>
In addition to CitiStat, Reilly also spoke of her innovative homeland defense strategies after Sept. 11. She said she vowed to make Santa Carla a model city in terms of preparation for a similar attack. <br>
Reilly said she heightened intelligence of bio-terrorism through sharing knowledge among hospitals, police and fire departments. <br>
Security was heightened as well through tracking and mapping bio-terrorist symptoms, such as heightened paramedic runs and examinations of animal carcasses for elevated levels of certain chemicals, she said. <br>
As a part of emergency response, she said, equipment needs were assessed, as well as inoculations and vaccines. <br>
Reilly said the strategies she employs serve as something more than simply eliminating the weeds in the vacant lot, the trash in the alley or the kids on the corner. <br>
&quot;My satisfaction comes from seeing kids playing football in a once vacant lot,&quot; she said, &quot;or when I see older people outside scrubbing their white marble steps, no longer afraid of being shot. <br>
&quot;I want to restore a higher level of justice and stability.&quot; <br>
Reilly 's speech was part of the Contemporary Issues in Public Administration Lecture Series, sponsored by the School of Urban Affairs and Public Policy.<br>
