--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Mail Call <br>
<br>
The Andromeda was docked with Haukin Tao Drift – no matter where they went the crew always seemed to end up back at that drift. Dylan, Rommie and Harper had stayed on board while Beka, Trance and Tyr went shopping. For once the Andromeda was in tiptop shape and had a full supply of spare parts. While things were quiet Dylan took the liberty of downloading the mail waiting for his small crew. While he was sorting the flexi’s in to piles for their respective recipients something about one of Harper’s messages caught his attention – the name of the sender: Brendan. <br>
<br>
Dylan never clicked right away but after several seconds of staring at the flexi he realised what the message meant. Quickly he grabbed the flexi and headed out of command. <br>
<br>
“Andromeda, where’s Harper?” <br>
<br>
“He’s just entered machine shop 17.” Replied the disembodied voice of the ship made flesh. “Shall I tell him you’re looking for him?” <br>
<br>
“No, no, don’t do anything.” <br>
<br>
Dylan quickly made his way through the ships many corridors to Harper’s machine shop and arrived minutes later, ‘Huh, new record’ he thought to himself. <br>
<br>
When Dylan entered the machine shop Harper was busy looking for something. <br>
<br>
“What have you lost?” He said while slightly out of breath. <br>
<br>
“My nano-welder.” Harper was clearly frustrated. “Where’s Trance when you need her.” <br>
<br>
Dylan looked around and saw it lying on the floor behind a trolley. He picked it up and handed it to Harper. <br>
<br>
“Thanks, sure you’re not Trance in disguise?” <br>
<br>
“Nope, but I bet I can brighten your day.” He handed Harper the flexi. Just as he sat down to read, Andromeda informed Dylan of an incoming message for him – from Charlemagne Bolivar. <br>
<br>
“Captain Hunt.” <br>
<br>
“Charlemagne Bolivar, how can I help you?” <br>
<br>
“Actually, it’s how I can help you.” <br>
<br>
“Care to elaborate on that.” <br>
<br>
For the next few minutes Charlemagne explained himself telling Dylan that the Drago Kazov have developed some kind of new weapon and were planning to turn it against the new Commonwealth now fifty-two worlds strong. He told him of a missile – partially sentient and programmed to reach it’s target no matter what – that it had stealth capability, an AI system and a limited point defence system. He also told of the Dragon’s plans to use it against the member worlds and the new High Guard fleet being built at San-Ska-Rae. However, what shocked Dylan the most was where the missile was being developed - on Earth. <br>
<br>
Dylan saw the chance to kill two birds with one stone and make the best of a bad situation. He could keep his promise to Harper and deal a devastating blow to the Drago Kazov. Under the terms of The Mutual Defence Pact the Sabre-Jaguar fleet would aid in the defence of the member worlds until the threat was taken care of. Dylan had his own fleet to take care of the Drago Kazov in the Sol system. <br>
<br>
Their discussion took about ten minutes during which Harper had read and reread the message countless times, he couldn’t believe it, all this time he had thought Brendan was dead, now he had hope. Once Dylan had finished he looked at Harper. <br>
<br>
“Save it, you don’t have to ask, we’re going to Earth.” <br>
<br>
Harper was overjoyed but Dylan was horrified. Such a weapon would spell destruction for the fragile alliance of the new Commonwealth. <br>
<br>
“Rommie, recall Tyr, Beka and Trance, we’re leaving.” <br>
<br>
“Eye sir.” The screen persona of the ship replied. <br>
<br>
With that Dylan left for command to start planning his latest quest, luckily for him, as the Captain of the flagship of the Commonwealth and principle recruiter, he had some leeway when it came to the ruling council and their orders. <br>
<br>
Harper sat on his bunk, shock still over running his bodily functions, he still couldn’t believe Brendan was alive, he was, entranced. Suddenly he realised he was alone and darted about trying to make himself presentable. He scurried around picking up his tools but stopped when he hit a snag. <br>
<br>
“Hey Andromeda, have you seen my forcelance.” <br>
<br>
“Harper, that’s disgusting.” <br>
<br>
“What?…No, no my actual forcelance, I can’t find it.” <br>
<br>
Andromeda’s hologram appeared, glancing at Harper. She closed her eyes briefly to scan the room. <br>
<br>
“It’s on your bunk in the corner, under your blue shirt.” <br>
<br>
“Thanks babe, you’re a lifesaver.” <br>
<br>
“Actually, I’m a warship, but close enough.” Harper smiled at her last comment as he picked up the lance and headed to command. <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: preparations <br>
<br>
In command, once everyone was present, Dylan explained the situation and Andromeda replayed sections of the conversation between Dylan and Charlemagne dealing with the weapon. When he was done the crew stood in silence for several moments. <br>
<br>
“If that’s true, there will be no stopping the Drago Kazov and not even Drago Musevini’s remains will keep your ship intact.” Tyr said softly as he leaned against the bulkhead. Suddenly Dylan began to bark out orders. <br>
<br>
“Alright, Beka, Tyr, on the flight deck are two slip fighters being prepared for launch. Tyr, you’re going to Mobius. The high guard training facility should have a full battalion of lancers ready to go. Beka, Sintii, there should be a whole lot of engineer’s, officers, medic’s etcetera etcetera ready to go. Get them prepared to travel ASAP; we’ll meet Beka at Sintii in six hours. Tyr, we’ll rendezvous with you six hours later. The Drago Kazov want a war, we’ll give ‘em one.” <br>
<br>
They didn’t move, or rather they couldn’t. They couldn’t believe what Dylan had just said, since when was he ‘Mr. kick ass first, ask questions later’. With Beka and Tyr gone Dylan took the helm and streamed to the crab nebula, at the centre of which sat a hidden star system: simply a rogue star and a single planet, the perfect hiding place for the high guard fleet led by the wrath of Achilles. Ryan instantly hailed the Andromeda. <br>
<br>
“Captain hunt? Can I help you?” <br>
<br>
“Absolutely Ryan, I’m calling your fleet in to service. We’re starting a war.” <br>
<br>
“Terrific. I mean, well, you know, we’ve needed something to do. just tell us where and when.” <br>
<br>
“I thought you might say that. Andromeda, link up with the Achilles and the fleets NAV systems, we’ll be taking them with us. Harper, make sure the fleet is battle ready, trance, make sure they’re fully loaded with medical supplies, something tells me they’ll be needed.” <br>
<br>
with that they broke up and went about their business and prepared the fleet for battle. once the fleet was ready, Dylan had them fall into battle group formation with the Andromeda and the Achilles forming the centres of the two groups. with everyone ready the battle groups jumped in to the slipstream and headed to the rendezvous with Beka. <br>
<br>
The fleet emerged in Sintii space several minutes later to find Beka waiting in orbit leading a fleet of troop transports filled to the brim with officers, engineers, gunners, pilots, medics, and almost every other person required for Starship operations on board. Dylan was amazed at just how many people he had before him, never in his career had he ever had so many under his command. It took several hours to get the new crews split between the fleet and acclimated to their new environments and comfortable with their roles aboard ship. Once Dylan felt they were ready he decided it was time to meet up with Tyr, who by now was probably ready to kill most of the lancers he had met. <br>
<br>
With the flash of blue light the slipstream opened up and swallowed the fleet one by one, all now under the control of their own individual pilots. Minutes later they all returned to normal space on approach to Mobius and the waiting Lancers, Dylan’s fighting force and the means by which he would keep his promise to Harper and strike a deadly blow to the Dragans. When the Andromeda closed to real time viewing range Dylan and Rommie were amazed at the poetry before them, hundreds of ships, large, small and all full of Lancers. Seconds after the Andromeda streamed in a fleet of Nietzschean ships slipped in at their backs, luckily, they were Sabre-Jaguar taking their role seriously. <br>
<br>
Quickly, the Nietzscheans took up positions in orbit of Mobius ready to defend it at the first sign of trouble. The lancers easily found their new homes and adapted to them in less than an hour, everything was ready; well, almost everything. All that was left to do now was organise the forces on Earth. And, prove that Dylan kept his promises. Dylan decided the best staging area for the fleet would be in the Proxima Centari system. Despite being Sol systems next-door neighbour, the Dragans had no interest in the system so was perfect for Dylan’s needs. <br>
<br>
Dylan, Rommie and Harper took the Maru and slipped to Earth, but not before making sure the crews knew that the ships Avatar’s were in command, they did after all have much more experience than any other officer in history. Once again Rommie generated a false meteor storm to conceal the Maru’s landing and Harper led the way through the old streets of Boston to his cousin’s hide out. As they rounded the corner to the secret entrance the trio froze at the sound of multiple blasters charging. Fearing for their lives they thought better than trying to fight, they all knew how tough and relentless the Nietzscheans were but only Harper knew just how bad the particular Niets of Earth were and it showed in his body language despite the fact that he was standing still. <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Chapter 3: An Old Acquaintance <br>
<br>
The small group stood absolutely still, well they tried to; Harper was reliving his child hood once again and he could barely do anything other than mutter to himself in terror. <br>
<br>
“Well, well, well. Dylan, long time no see.” The voice was thick with sarcasm that was on a par with Beka at times. All three knew the voice but in their current environment only Rommie could identify it. <br>
<br>
“Cuchulain…?” Questioned Rommie. Slowly they turned to face their captor, Rommie was right – as usual. <br>
<br>
“Fleet Marshall.” <br>
<br>
“Try Lieutenant, all thanks to you. Now its time for some payback.” His voice full of hate, he raised his gauss pistol level with Dylan’s head and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. The gun wasn’t loaded “Did you really think it was going to be that easy, please, I want to make this last so I can savour every second of your pain. However, you can rest assured, your death will give me the opportunity to regain my former glory and destroy the Kodiak and your Commonwealth at the same time.” <br>
<br>
“Don’t forget Drago’s bones.” <br>
<br>
Cuchulain’s guards looked around at one another, they too had heard the rumours that the mummified remains of the progenitor had been stolen and replaced with a fake, but of course they hadn’t believed it. <br>
<br>
Cuchulain marched Dylan, Rommie and Harper towards the nearest labour camp for interrogation, torture and eventually, their deaths and he was not shy about showing the contentment he felt with the situation. Finally, things would be back to normal and his only true adversary would be dead; however, even he had to admit that without such a person his life as a Nietzschean was pointless. Suddenly, a blinding flash lit the area around the small group and the sounds of weapons fire could be heard atop the inaudible screams of the Nietzscheans as a high pitched shrilling sound filled their ears. Harper recognised that sound instantly, he invented the first shriller upon which the ones his cousin was using were based. The Niets collapsed bringing their hands to cover their ears and subdue the pain the high-pitched frequencies caused them. When the situation calmed down Rommie was the first to regain her vision and was greatly surprised by what she saw. <br>
<br>
“Why Lieutenant, captured by a KLUDGE, that won’t look good on your file will it. How are you Brendan?” <br>
<br>
As she said Kludge, the irony was not lost on Cuchulain even though he was almost unconscious. Harper turned instantly at the sound of his cousin’s name to see Cuchulain lying face down on the ground with Brendan standing above him with his foot firmly pressing down on his back and pointing a force lance at the Nietzscheans head. Cuchulain was not amused. When Dylan finally regained his vision he surveyed the damage, all of Cuchulain’s troops were dead or lay dieing on the ground while all of Brendan’s troops were still standing, even he had to admire the efficiency of the resistance. <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: Reunited <br>
<br>
Haper hurled himself at Brendan, arms outstretched to take his cousin into the biggest hug in history. As soon as he got within 10 feet, he was stopped by the sound of a rifle being charged. He turned around to see that Brendan’s troops had trained their guns on the intruders; or as they would soon find out, they were known as the traitor from the High Guard who couldn’t keep his word if his life depended on it, the deserter – a coward who couldn’t stay and fight so he ran away (sound like the Neitzscheans they so with to get rid of don’t they) and an AI, nuff said. Fortunately for the trio, one signal from Brendan and his soldiers lowered their weapons. Cautiously Harper walked over to his cousin and hugged him. They were silent for some time but that single hug they said more to the other than words ever made possible. <br>
<br>
With Cuchulain taken prisoner, Brendan led the group to his hideout and his rapidly diminishing army. The Drago Kazov had been going after the resistance much more heavily in Boston since that’s where it started; Kill The Origin, The Rest Will Crumble, that is their motto. Well actually it was The Strong Survive, The Weak Clean Their Boots, but that didn’t do this job justice so they changed it. <br>
<br>
When they approached the resistance's base of operations Brendan went in first followed by his second in command dragging Cuchulain behind him on a LEASH of all things. As Dylan was about to enter the trio heard an uproar from inside the camp, a cry of pain and screams of pleasure sounded almost instantly. It was obvious even to Dylan what was happening, Cuchulain was being tortured and the observing crowds loved every second of his pain. Cuchulain fell to the floor, his face covered in gashes; the blood flowing freely. One of Brendan's men approached him with an oddly shaped piece of wood, long, thin at one end and quite thick at the other. He raised it above his head and brought it down HARD on Cuchulain's back, as he raised what Dylan would later learn was a baseball bat for another swing. Dylan broke free of his guard and he ran forward through the screaming crowds and caught it mid strike. The force and speed of the bat caused him great pain but he held it in, the force with which the bat hit his hand would probably have increased with the microseconds it would have taken for it to make contact with Cuchulain's back. It could have quite easily killed him, no man, not even Cuchulain deserved to be beaten to death, well, almost. <br>
<br>
&quot;That's enough, I came here to keep my promise and cripple the Drago Kazov, not to watch a man beaten to death even IF he may deserve it. Now, you can kill him and live in the knowledge that the Dragan's will hunt you down to extinction until they kill every human on Earth, or, you can help me to destroy their new weapon and eradicate the Dragan presence on Earth and free the planet. This isn't like the last time, I don't have some other battle to fight that's more important, and I'm here to keep the promise made to you and Harper.&quot; <br>
<br>
He started off screaming, but his voice soon calmed to the commanding tone he always used with Tyr of all people. Who would have thought he would be comparing a human to Tyr. <br>
<br>
Brendan looked at the rabble before him, his troops had seen better days; and bigger numbers. Armed with a wide variety of weapons, from gauss pistols and forcelances to knives and sticks. Their limbs had been broken more times than he could remember, their bodies littered with scars and even fresh wounds badly dressed. They didn't stand a chance. He and Dylan had made a plan to attack the local barracks early in the morning when most of the Neitzscheans would still be asleep, when they would have the advantage. <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: Hope and Fear, lots of Fear <br>
<br>
Harper awoke – soaked in sweat. The lights were low, very low. The only sound he could here – that of his own heartbeat. He had to strain to see his hand in front of his face. As he slowly became accustomed to the darkness his eyes began to focus and adapt. It was still pitch black but he could at least make out he shapes of the objects around him – shapes he knew all too well. He looked around and began to recognise the various consoles and equipment of his home away from home on the Andromeda; he was in medical, and he was alone. He was afraid, very afraid. Harper froze. Instinctively he tried to sit up only to be stopped by blinding pain in his right leg. Fear took control of him at that moment. Terrified, he looked down at his right leg. His vision was blurred from the intensity of the pain but it was good enough for him to see at close range. He stared for mere moments but from what he saw, to Harper, it seemed like hours. What he saw struck terror into his heart. What he saw was the second worse than anything he could ever have imagined happening to him since he left Earth, and being from, Earth he could imagine quite a bit. His leg, or rather, what was left of it, was a complete mess. Covered in blood with parts of the bone exposed; it truly was a horrific sight – below his right knee, nothing of his leg remained, except for a pile of flesh and bone on the floor beside the bed that is. Although he didn’t know it, at that moment fear was his biggest ally. His fear produced massive quantities of adrenaline keeping him conscious which would have made this so much more difficult, but, he was so scared and afraid that his fear overwhelmed the rest of his senses, numbing the pain he would have felt, a pain so great it would have been unbearable. He started screaming and shouting hoping that someone would hear him and come to his rescue. He soon gave up however when it became apparent that no one was coming. The he heard it, a solitary voice somewhere in the darkness, it caused him to wake from his almost sleep. He heard it again and instantly recognised it was Rommie and she was calling to him – this time he listened. <br>
<br>
“We’re all alone now Seamus. They’re all gone, all dead. It’s just you and me now Seamus, you and me against the universe.” <br>
<br>
And then there was only silence. Harper called out to her time and time again until his throat was sore, but she never answered. He was alone again and the silence was killing him. He broke down crying at that moment just like a child who had fallen off of their bike and scrapped their knee crying for mummy to make it all better. But he had fallen off of no bike and scrapped no knee, he cried simply out of fear and of loss, loss of his friends, his family, his home and his love. <br>
<br>
He awoke on the ground in a cold sweat covered in dirt, Rommie ever vigil at his side. His eyes darted around, unsure of where he was. He soon heard Dylan and Brendan talking in the background and everything rapidly came back to him, hitting him with the emotional force of 50-gigatone nuke. He jumped forward and wrapped his arm around Rommie; she could see that he was upset and uneasy, but somehow she saw joy in Harper’s eyes at the very sight of her, Rommie decided there and then that she somehow had to get Harper to talk about that, that nightmare. On the outside Harper showed dozens of emotions at once but inside he was jumping for joy simply because he knew that the people he cared about, and Tyr, were still alive but he was also deeply disturbed by his dream and he knew that Rommie knew that, he was dreading her attempts to get him to talk but he also realised he had seen his worst fear personified, his fear of being alone but he was now much more willing and definitely ready to face it. <br>
<br>
Harper stared at Rommie; the look on her face was one of concern for a friend. He suddenly realised just how late it was, the sky was black, the stars only a faint glimmer through the hole in the roof that served as a chimney and air vent for the campfire situated directly below. Harper looked at his creation, the glow of the campfire beautifully accented her tanned skin, Rommie knew that look, the look as if her were undressing her with his eyes, she made a sound as if clearing her throat. Harper flashed her his patented mischievous grin. Rommie rolled her eyes as if saying ‘yep he’s fine’ but as she stood to walk away Harper grabbed her arm – refusing to let her go. She looked down at her engineer with a questioning gaze. <br>
<br>
“Rommie please, please don’t go, not yet, I really don’t wanna be alone not - not after that…that dream.” <br>
<br>
For the first time since the larvae had become active Rommie saw true fear in Harper’s eyes. She wanted to just curl up with him right there and try to get him to talk about it but she maintained her composure and ‘reluctantly’ sat down. <br>
<br>
“You know Harper, you are a big boy and it was only a dream.” <br>
<br>
“Yeah I know but still.” <br>
<br>
“We’re not leaving yet anyway, the Drago Kazov just sent out a couple of extra patrols and the local base has just been reinforced, Dylan’s plan won’t work now so he and Brendan are formulating a new one.” <br>
<br>
Her speech was simply a statement but her tone was one of understanding and compassion, Harper knew that she wouldn’t leave him like this anyway but what she just said, or rather how she said it just confirmed that for him. He now had hope to guide him. He believed what Rommie had meant, that she would never leave him. Yes he now had to hope to drive him in his life, hope that his fear would never be realised in his lifetime. <br>
<br>
Harper sat up and Rommie sat close beside him, wrapping her arm around her engineer, but she made sure Harper knew it was only a friendly gesture. He’d learned that the hard way the last time and nodded understandingly. There they sat for several minutes. Rommie could feel Harper falling asleep again. Suddenly he broke the peaceful silence. <br>
<br>
“Hey Rommie?” He was half asleep. <br>
<br>
“Yes Harper.” She sighed inwardly; he was almost asleep. <br>
<br>
“Why red?” <br>
<br>
“Huh?” <br>
<br>
“Your hair, why red?” <br>
<br>
“Oh, well I was tired of blue, besides, it goes better with my uniform.” <br>
<br>
“Oh.” <br>
<br>
“Go sleep Harper, I’ll be here all night with you.” With that he fell asleep, then Rommie thought to herself ‘Why did I choose red?’ <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Chapter 6: Plans and Actions <br>
<br>
Dylan, Harper and Rommie returned to the Andromeda several hours later. Despite all of Harper’s ‘requests’ or, as it’s more commonly known, begging – Brendan refused to come with them or to let Harper stay planet side with him. <br>
<br>
“There’ll be plenty of time for that later Shay.” He kept saying. “Now, get off of my planet.” Was his final response to Harper’s final attempt. Brendan had forgotten just how annoying Harper could be when he wanted to be. <br>
<br>
As soon as they got back to the Andromeda Dylan headed for Command while Harper went to check that the ‘ship was combat ready’ – he really didn’t trust these new High Guard engineers, especially with his supply of Sparky or Rommie, ‘Thank the Divine this is only temporary,’ he thought to himself, ‘I hope.’ Rommie too had decided that she didn’t entirely trust these engineers, well, with herself at least. She quickly began following Harper. That is, until Dylan stopped her and told her to come with him. As the pair walked into Command they finished their conversation. <br>
<br>
“So, you’re clear on plan B?” <br>
<br>
“Dylan, I’m an Android and as Harper is so fond of saying I have a brain the size of a planet.” She said mockingly. “You only have to tell me things once. I’ll be ready, I just hope it doesn’t come down to that.” <br>
<br>
“You and me both Rommie, you and me both.” Dylan walked towards the Captain’s podium and Rommie took up position at the First Officers as Beka assumed her position at the Helm Tyr never moving from Tactical. Despite having a full crew aboard Dylan never really felt the need for a Command Staff, not with Tyr, Rommie and Beka at his side anyway. A few minutes later Harper sauntered into Command muttering under his breath about how trust worthy the new crew was. Despite what the rest of the crew could pick up including Tyr, only Rommie could hear exactly what he was mumbling. Harper hated being proved wrong. <br>
<br>
He walked to the front of the Command Deck and crawled into an access port to do some last system checks before the mission. The second he closed the entry hatch Harper could hear the laughs of Tyr, Dylan, Beka and Rommie, ‘Good thing Trance wasn’t there.’ He thought. ‘Just enjoy it now, we’ll see who has the last laugh.’ He thought resisting the urge to cackle maniacally. He emerged about an hour later less than a hundred metres from Machine Shop 17. <br>
<br>
“Well, while I’m here.” He said to himself before turning towards the Machine Shop. As soon as he entered he made a B line for his secret stash of Sparky, hidden discretely below the Pilot chair of the X-1. <br>
<br>
After he downed a few he reported in to Dylan. <br>
<br>
“Hey Dylan?” He said trusting the Andromeda to open the comm. Line. <br>
<br>
“Yes Mister Harper.” Harper cringed; he hated it when Dylan called him that. <br>
<br>
“The Andromeda is completely Battle Ready, engines, PDL’s, missile launchers, AG systems, everything is, for once, operating at peak efficiency all thanks to yours truly. We’re good to go.” <br>
<br>
“Not quite, there’s one more thing I want you to do first, well, sixty eight more things is actually more like it.” <br>
<br>
Harper’s heart sank, luckily for him Machine Shop 17 had been shut off from the rest of the crew as his private space so no one saw his reaction. He couldn’t believe it, more work, even with a full engineering staff at his disposal Dylan still treated Harper like the only engineer on board. He’d done so much work these days that Harper really did deserve a break however, he couldn’t really say no to Dylan, after all, he was helping him to free his home world. <br>
<br>
“Ok Dylan, what do you need?” <br>
<br>
“Well, you remember the Footprint Magnification Systems you built to help take out the Balance, oh, sorry Rommie.” <br>
<br>
“It’s Ok Dylan, really.” <br>
<br>
“Yeah, as if I could ever forget. I got two scars in that fight.” <br>
<br>
“Any way, so far an FMS is only programmed to project High Guard profiles.” <br>
<br>
“And your point being?” <br>
<br>
“Could you reprogram them to project say, Drago Kazov profiles in stead?” <br>
<br>
“Oh I get it. The old Trojan Horse trick, well, a contemporary version at least. Sure we got enough data in Rommie’s Mainframe, absolutely, give me twenty minutes.” <br>
<br>
“Eh yeah, anyway let me know when your done Dylan out.” Dylan turned to Rommie, looking at Beka and Tyr as he did. <br>
<br>
“Trojan Horse?&quot; She replied with only a blank stare. <br>
<br>
About an hour later Harper walked into Command with a modified FMS in hand. <br>
<br>
“What took you so long boy?” Harper didn’t even look at Tyr. <br>
<br>
“What, I had to set up a production line didn’t I. Rommie’s bots and shops are assembling the systems while the Andromeda’s core AI updates the software of the completed systems. The other 67 will be ready to go within the hour. Harper said proudly. <br>
<br>
“Don’t you think we should test this one first? Perhaps Harper did something wrong.” Harper silently sarcastically mimicked Tyr, and, he was getting very good at it. <br>
<br>
“Harper, enough. As much as I trust you, Tyr’s right, have you tested it?” <br>
<br>
“Not yet, but I’ve got the Maru ready to go, all I have to do is hook up Sally here.” <br>
<br>
“Sally?” Beka questioned. <br>
<br>
“She…Sallywas a girl I grew up with, she lived pretty close to me and we were really good friends, the night the Dragons got my parents, they got her too. And now, she is goinna get her revenge.” <br>
<br>
“Say no more.” <br>
<br>
Harper walked out of Command and headed for the Maru. A couple of minutes later he took her out and activated the FMS. Instantly the Maru transformed into a Drago Kazov Destroyer. <br>
<br>
“Happy now.” Harper’s smug expression appeared on the main screen. <br>
<br>
“Ok, another sixty seven and we’re ready to go. Bring it home Harper.” <br>
<br>
“You got it Boss.” <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Chapter 7: Ready And Willing <br>
With the new FMS tested and proven, Harper brought the Maru back aboard the Andromeda. He left the ship the second it was docked with a celebratory Sparky in hand. Harper ran straight to Machine Shop Twelve to check on production. Just as he left the hanger he bumped into Dylan. <br>
<br>
“Harper slow down.” He yelled. <br>
<br>
“Sorry Dylan gotta check up on the production line.” <br>
<br>
“Ok, but slow down.” Harper started running. “And Harper.” <br>
<br>
“Yeah?” <br>
<br>
“Good job.” <br>
<br>
“Thanks.” And he hurried away before Dylan came up with something else for him to do. <br>
<br>
About an hour later all the FMS production was complete and Rommie’s bots were loading them into the Maru as Harper installed one on the Andromeda. With the loading and installation complete Harper and Rommie left in the Maru to install a modified FMS on every ship in the fleet, at Dylan’s request of course. With a fleet of 67 other ships that was no small task but Dylan insisted that Harper oversee the installation throughout the entire fleet since he had the most experience, even if it did take the rest of the day, which it did. The Maru returned shortly after midnight, and, for once Harper went straight to bed. <br>
<br>
This action alone had Rommie very, very worried, as it also did Trance. She too had been up late jut making sure that each hip had plenty of supplies. She turned the corner as Harper left the hanger bay: stumbling as he did, she had never seen him so tired. Trance ran over and helped him up, she wanted to take him to medical to check him out but as soon as he was up Harper started walking towards his quarters. Trance followed him a few metres behind, just in case. Once Harper was safely inside she called to Andromeda. <br>
<br>
“Andromeda, keep an eye on Harper will you?” <br>
<br>
“I’m afraid he just engaged privacy mode Trance. I…” She was cut off. <br>
<br>
“Medical over ride, disengage privacy mode, authorisation Trance Gemini Chief Medical Officer – Lambda Red 3981…” She paused. “Lambda Red 3981 Harper.” <br>
<br>
Andromeda hesitated. “Unusual code, but valid, I’ll let you know if anything happens.” <br>
<br>
“Thank you.” Trance hated herself for what she’d just done, and for what she just gave away, but it was for Harper’s own good. She worried about him, more than either of them knew. She knew deep down that she had shown Andromeda a side of herself, a secret, she would rather not have, but she also knew Andromeda and was sure that it would not go any further. <br>
<br>
Andromeda’s hologram materialised several hours later in Trances quarters at the foot of the bed. Slowly the lights came on and built up to a level sufficient to wake Trance. Aside from the young woman, Andromeda was the only other person aboard to see inside her quarters. Trance awoke almost immediately. <br>
<br>
“Harper!” She almost yelled. <br>
<br>
“His heart rate has rapidly increased and his breathing become very erratic, his temperature also increased by three degrees Centigrade and his body keeps flailing and squirming. It’s most likely a nightmare but I thought you should know.” <br>
<br>
“Thanks.” Said Trance as she sprinted out of the room towards Harper’s. <br>
<br>
As soon as Trance reached the door Andromeda opened it for her. Trance rushed inside straight to Harper’s bedside. She began to shake him vigorously to try and wake him. When that failed Andromeda turned the lights up full which. For a moment blinded Trance, even she couldn’t go from dim to star strength that fast. However, even such a strong light failed to wake Harper up. When he wouldn’t wake Trance and Andromeda became very worried. <br>
<br>
Before calling Beka or Dylan, Trance wanted to try one last thing. She placed her hand on Harper’s forehead to steady it, and then slowly she bent forward and gently kissed Harper’s right cheek. His skin was soft and moist against her lips due to the sweat, not like when she was purple – before the switch – but it was enough. Harper slowly began to rouse from his slumber; the first thing he saw brought warm feelings to his heart. By this time, Andromeda had turned the lights down to what they were when Trance first came in. As Harper looked up at Trance’s face he stared into her eyes and he could swear he saw dozens of galaxies. After staring for what seemed like an eternity Harper came back to reality. <br>
<br>
He sat up in bed and looked at Trance soon realising that she was wearing only a nightgown and robe but, for some reason that eluded him at the time, that wasn’t what he was looking at. Here he was in his quarters with this beautiful woman barely dressed in a silk nightgown and robe and he wasn’t even looking at her but at the space around her that drew his attention. Harper could swear that Trance was radiation a golden glow lighting the space around her – not much, it probably wouldn’t have been visible during the day but now, in the dim light of his quarters it was very, very clear. Harper couldn’t believe it, he was in aw, as he stared at Trance he suddenly realised that she was speaking and that he hadn’t heard a word. <br>
<br>
“Trance, Trance what is it?” <br>
<br>
“I said are you alright? Andromeda told me that you’re heart rate and breathing were unstable. She was worried about you.” <br>
<br>
“Yeah, yeah I’m fine Trance, thanks.” <br>
<br>
“You don’t look fine, that must have been some nightmare, trying to wake you was really difficult, and, according to the super genius that is you, you’re a very light sleeper, after growing up on Earth.” <br>
<br>
“Well, it was pretty bad.” <br>
<br>
Trance looked at her friend, her compassion showing in her eyes. <br>
<br>
“Do you wanna talk about it? You really should you know.” <br>
<br>
“Trance babe, as much as I hate to disappoint, especially you, this really isn’t the kind of thing you and I ‘can’ talk about.” How could they talk about it – after all, the dream was about her, for the most part anyway. <br>
<br>
“Are you sure?” <br>
<br>
“Yeah, I’ll be fine, got a lot to do today anyway, I could use an early start.” <br>
<br>
Trance looked on, her expression hadn’t changed but her compassion had become fear and worry and Harper could see it all too clearly. <br>
<br>
“Tell you what Trance, Andromeda, I want you to keep an eye on me today, ignore any privacy requests and monitor my vitals and all that. If at any time you become concerned for me, inform Trance immediately, got it?” <br>
<br>
“Understood Harper.” <br>
<br>
Trance relaxed, she knew her body was nowhere near as good a liar as she was and it didn’t help when Harper could read her like a book. She knew he’d only done it to calm her down but Trance was glad he did and wouldn’t soon forget Harper’s sacrifice – she knew just how much Harper valued his privacy. Trance rose to leave but he grabbed her hand. <br>
<br>
“Trance, you won’t leave will you?” <br>
<br>
“What do you mean?” <br>
<br>
“Like, you wouldn’t just pack up and go, would you? I mean, well, you know I lost the rest of my family and I feel like you guys are my family now and since I don’t need to worry about you dieing at least, all you can do is leave.” <br>
<br>
“Harper, you don’t have to worry, I’d never leave you like that. Now try to get some sleep, big day, well today, you’ll need it.” Harper lay back down and Trance tucked him in. Just as she was about to leave she bent forward and kissed Harper on the forehead. <br>
<br>
“Sleep tight Seamus.” She left his room and Andromeda turned down the lights. <br>
<br>
“So much for an early start.” He mumbled. <br>
<br>
A few hours later Harper awoke as normal, he got showered, dressed and started the day with his customary can of Sparky. After he was done he headed to the briefing on the Obs deck to find out what Dylan’s master plan was. The briefing wasn’t due to start until 09:00 but Harper got there at 5 to and it was already underway. Dylan however seemed more annoyed at Harper’s presence than his absence. ‘Rommie’ he mumbled, ‘will you ever learn to shut up.’ <br>
<br>
Andromeda’s hologram appeared in miniature form beside him. <br>
<br>
“Actually, I didn’t say a thing. Dylan knew he’d been pushing you really hard lately and he wanted to give you a break, that’s why he started without you and why I didn’t wake you, didn’t you wonder about that – he told me not too.” <br>
<br>
Dylan heard Rommie talking to Harper and looked out to see Harper standing there beside her. Dylan broke from his speech and addressed Harper. <br>
<br>
“Mister Harper, you shouldn’t be here.” <br>
<br>
“Like hell I shouldn’t, Dylan this is my home we’re planning about, I wanna help.” <br>
<br>
“Harper you’ve helped more than enough already, besides, Beka’s going to need you here, just leave this to us. Dismissed.” <br>
<br>
Harper stood his ground for a moment but he couldn’t stand having the Captains of the other ships looking at him like that, even if they were avatars. He slowly started to turn. <br>
<br>
“Fine, but on two conditions.” <br>
<br>
“I’m listening.” Dylan was royally pissed, how dare Harper humiliate him like this, he knew this wasn’t a democracy, he had no right doing this, but, if I would get rid of him…. <br>
<br>
“One, you let me come down the second you win.” <br>
<br>
“Deal, and two?” <br>
<br>
“Stop calling me Mister Harper, its too weird.” <br>
<br>
“Fine. Dismissed.” <br>
<br>
Harper turned as Dylan went back to the briefing, as he walked through the door Harper overheard Dylan detailing some of his plan. <br>
<br>
“The first drop will be at 1400 hours, we estimate all orbital and ninety per cent of all planetary defences will be disabled by then. I’ll lead the first drop, the second will be led by….” Dylan was cut off by the doors closing, but Harper had heard enough, enough to formulate a plan of his own. <br>

<br>
Dylan sat in his quarters the day after the briefing, the Day Of Liberation as Harper called it; he used the term so much that Dylan had changed the name of the impending attack to Operation Liberty. It was almost noon; he walked towards the closet and removed a combat uniform. He arrived in Command about half an hour later wearing full High Guard battle dress. But this wasn’t just any battle dress, not the basic black uniform with the blue stripe, this was a uniform made especially for his New Commonwealth. It clearly displayed on the collar, in boxes of white rimmed in red the Argosy Special Ops insignia on the right and his rank pin on his left, not to mention the New Commonwealth emblem on the sides of the arms just below the shoulders, the red stripe usually withheld for more formal uniforms adorned this uniform, but rather than coming across the chest and down the wearers right the stripe came across the chest to the right but this time curved down to meet the bottom of the zipper, clasps just didn’t look right, and ran around the bottom just above the waist, and of course, old faithful ever at his side. As Dylan entered Command everyone was present and all eyes were on him, as Rommie looked on Harper looked over towards her, he could swear he saw jealousy on her face, despite having created her and at one point being able to tell what she was thinking from the expression on her face, Rommie had actually grown out of the look she was given and created one of her own, as such Harper could no longer read her like an open book, much to his annoyance. Seeing what he was sure was jealousy he quickly took out a small flexi and handed it to her as he walked by her to get to Dylan, this was his last real chance and he knew it. Just as Harper was about to speak Rommie hurriedly left Command, only Harper knowing why. <br>
<br>
“So how do you like it?” He asked as he approached Dylan at the Captains podium. <br>
<br>
“It’s incredible Mr…” He paused “Harper, sorry.” <br>
<br>
“I’ll let that one slide, this time. You really like it?” Dylan nodded. <br>
<br>
“That’s a relief, I was really getting tired of that black and grew thing you were always wearing, and it was - too plain.” <br>
<br>
“Look Harper, I know why you’re doing this and I can understand why, I would have done anything to save Sara or to reach Tarn Vedra, but the price was too high. Look I can’t even imagine what it was like growing up on Earth but I saw how it effected you, how you reacted when Cuchulain captured us, you were as white as a sheet, you were trembling, you allowed your fear to take over, I need cool heads down there, I’m sorry.” <br>
<br>
“Hey, don’t worry about it, I had to try right.” Harper walked head down shoulders slumped out of Command. Dylan looked around. <br>
<br>
“Anyone else think that was a little too easy?” <br>
<br>
“Yeah definitely.” Beka answered. “No way is it that easy to get rid of Harper, not when he is this personally involved with something, especially his family and believe me, I've tried.” <br>
<br>
“It would appear that the little professor has a plan.” Uttered Tyr. <br>
<br>
“The question is, what is his plan and when is he going to act on it. And how far will he go to see it through to completion.” Trance spoke softly but the worry was very clear in her voice but only she and Rommie and Andromeda knew why. Only the trio knew of Harper’s dreams and only Andromeda knew any details about both, but then, they knew nothing of his second dream, only that it was a terrible nightmare, one which would take him some time to get over, if only he would confide in Rommie, or even Trance; Andromeda knew how Harper felt about the Golden woman even if he didn’t, he might be able to block out the feelings but his body still showed them. <br>
<br>
‘Perhaps he has avoided Trance and focused all of his attention on my avatar for a reason.’ Pondered the Andromeda, she would have to perform some more tests but she thought she had finally figured out the enigma that is Seamus Zelazny Harper. <br>
<br>
As soon as Harper left Command he resumed his natural posture and headed straight for Machine Shop 17. He engaged privacy mode the second he was inside and began a frantic search. The fleet was due to depart and stream to Earth at 13:00 hours and it was already quickly approaching. At about ten to he finally found what he was looking for and set his master plan in motion. <br>
<br>
“I am a genius,” He said to himself, “hell, even Tyr is goinna be proud of this.” <br>
<br>
Back on Command Andromeda gave Dylan the signal; it was time. He took his place at his podium and hailed the fleet. <br>
<br>
“Attention all ships this is Fleet Command, break Battle Group formation and assume Drago Kazov fleet formation, activate the EFMS (Enhanced Footprint Magnification System), bring ECM’s online, activate all weapons and link your NAV systems with the Andromeda’s.” He paused momentarily awaiting acknowledgement from the fleet. <br>
<br>
“All ships report Battle Ready Captain.” Andromeda reported. <br>
<br>
“Lets bring it.” He tuned to Beka. “Beka, if you please.” <br>
<br>
“Transiting to Slipstream in 5, 4, 3, 2, now.” The ship rocked at the initial entry as the tendrils of the stream reached out and pulled the fleet in one by one. <br>
<br>
Beka was glad she only had to do this once, the strain of literally piloting almost 70 ships at once was incredible, it was however soon over as the fleet entered the Sol system. <br>
<br>
“Thanks Dad.” Beka muttered to herself so low that Tyr never even heard it. <br>
<br>
“Rommie. Rommie? Where the hell…” <br>
<br>
“I’m here Dylan.” <br>
<br>
Dylan turned as the doors to Command closed behind the ships Avatar Rommie. <br>
<br>
&quot;Eh, fleet wide.” <br>
<br>
“Aye.” <br>
<br>
“This is Hunt, all ships, Battle Stations.” <br>
<br>
The lighting on Command changed instantly to the dark, eerie place the Andromeda’s crew had seen once too many, but at least this time, it was their choice. <br>

The fleet entered the system about twenty minutes out from Earth; Beka took them in, the Andromeda leading the pack of supposedly Drago Kazov ships. As the rest of the crew made did some last minute checks and made some final preparation Rommie walked over to Harper and kissed him on the cheek, an action that did not go unnoticed, especially by Dylan. <br>
<br>
“Thank you.” She said. <br>
<br>
“Hey, couldn’t have my Rom Doll feeling left out now could I.” She smiled at the use of a pet name she hadn’t heard for a while. <br>
<br>
Rommie’s new uniform was similar to Dylan’s, while his was all black with the red stripe and all of Harper’s additions, Rommie’s while still black and long sleeved had a V-neck, much shorter than Harper would have liked but he did after all want to live to see Earth freed. The V-neck showed very little skin, the top also had a collar, which ran into the V, it was on the collar where the white patches of the uniform were placed only this time rimmed in blue, the blue also rimmed the collar. While officially Rommie held no rank or special status the patches were far from empty. Inside each was an image, on the left was an image of the Andromeda, well, an XMC, pointing to the right while on the right pointing left was a forcelance, Harper always thought that Rommie was more of a hands on warrior deep down, more like a lancer than a warship so to him at least, the lance made sense. Again on the side of the arms below the shoulders was the new Commonwealth emblem, similar to the original Commonwealth insignia only more stylised with a colour change and the standards of the 50 original member worlds positioned in a circle around it. No red stripes this time but there were blue ones, angled upwards at the cuffs of the sleeves, three on each arm. <br>
<br>
About half way to Earth, Rommie now at the First Officers podium reported something very unusual. <br>
