Summery: Harper looses control over an old friend. <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br>
<br>
<br>
Fixing damage. That all I'm good for here. They are so quick to tell me to shut up, or to neglect my needs. So quick to overlook me or disregard my suggestions until something needs to be fixed. I throw my tools down in frustration and the loud echoing sound they make seems to make me feel a little better. The frustration I feel right now is something that I have had to deal with more and more lately. I feel like I'm falling apart. fixing the same conduits and circuits for a ship full of people who would toss me to the waste side if given the chance. It doesn't matter how many times Dylan says good job. I know I'm just a little mudfoot to him. I'm just a temporary fix-it man for his ship. I know he can't wait to get rid of me and get a &quot;real&quot; engineer from his precious Common Wealth. And Tyr...I don't even have to explain that. He's a Niet and I'm a kludge...end of story. Trance, Rev, Beka...they all have their own goal and reason for moving forward. They all have reasons for living. Unfortunately I don't. I've been struggling so hard to survive and for what? So I can be the dumb little kludge everywhere I go? So I can be treated like a pet instead of a person? I slam my fists against the conduit and it fizzles out adding to my growing rage. Running my hands through my hair I curse the day I arrived on this god-forsaken ship. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your suppose to fix the ship boy. Not break it.&quot; Came a voice from behind me. I knew exactly who it was. My shoulders tightened and my fists balled up and it felt like something in my head detached and entered my blood stream. It felt like something hot and caustic was flowing through my veins. I hadn't felt this in years. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tyr I don't wanna talk to you right now&quot; I said through clinched teeth. I knew he hadn't done anything to me but all I could see was red. He stood there oozing his testosterone and sporting his usual cocky smile. I couldn't stand it...He seemed so stable and sure of himself, everything I was lacking. He didn't deserve to have purpose. I've been struggling all my life and I can't find a reason to take my next breath, while he stands there with confidence. I could hear him stepping closer. The sound of his leather pants crackling and his boots hitting the ground was amazingly loud. It felt like he was mocking me. Strolling along filling the room with his superiority. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tyr! just leave. I'm warning you!&quot; I said almost yelling it. I could hear him snicker behind me. He didn't understand that I was trying not to hurt him...Trying not to let all this go. <br>
<br>
&quot;What are you gonna do?&quot; He said in his usually stoic yet amused tone. It was the last straw. What ever was holding me together snapped and I felt a sharp surge in my neck. I had to take him down. Remove the sly smile from his face. I had to make sure he would take me seriously next time I opened my mouth. I turned around and he flinched. The look he gave me was so familiar. I had seen it so many times on earth. His eyes searched mine and then he opened his mouth with hesitation. <br>
<br>
&quot;Har..harper..?&quot; I didn't let him finish, with all my might I punched him. I gritted my teeth and sent blow after blow hitting the dazed and surprised neit in his face. I begun to zone out. The red turning into a long tunnel. The light at the end getting smaller and smaller. I could hear myself talking but knew that I had never thought or intended to say those things. It all felt surreal, like I was watching this all happen from afar. <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you smiling now!&quot; I screamed. Was it me? Did I say that? He regained his composure and struck out but missed me. <br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone thinks I can't fight! They think I'm weak, but I'll show you!!&quot; All I could think about is the story of David and Goliath. My mom use to read it to me when I was younger. I was David taking this giant down. <br>
<br>
&quot;What's going on in here!&quot; Dylan said walking in the room angry as ever. Tyr diverted his attention and I took advantage. I wasn't ready for this fight to end, Something in me wouldn't let this fight end. I kicked him in his stomach and when he doubled over I hit him in the base of his neck. He fell to the ground and with all my strength I stomped down on his dreaded bone spurs snapping two of them in half. My breathing was ragged as I stood over the huge giant, Tyr anasazi. The big bad niet with all the charisma, all the overbearing conceit. He was finally taken down by me! A stupid kludge! Who's equal now! Someone grabbed me from behind and I didn't even attempt to struggle. I had done what I had needed to do, What...he had wanted to do. I had finished what I had started. Tyr would never second-guess me again. <br>
<br>
&quot;Trance...Report to the engine room.&quot; Dylan said eyeing me angrily. <br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell was that about Harper!&quot; He yelled. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm just tired Dylan! I’m tired of playing the happy little push over! I'm not the mat for you guys to walk all over...I refuse to be taken advantage of! I said poking Dylan in the chest. But it wasn't me. I watched as Trance scurried in the room and over to the unconscious Kodiak. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tyr just learned that lesson.&quot; I said before storming off to my room. I could hear Dylan yelling after me. Something about being confined to quarters but I didn't care. I didn't give a damn. <br>
<br>
<br>
3 Hours later. <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br>
<br>
I heard a knock on my door and I quickly wiped my face. I knew exactly what was wrong with me and I knew that Beka would know too. I had hoped this day would never come but hear it is. <br>
<br>
&quot;Harper...please let me in.&quot; Beka said through the door. Her voice was pleasant and even though I had a feeling of dread tugging at my mind and heart I let her in anyway. She stepped in and let the door close behind her. She stood silently in my dark room just staring at me. I felt like I fool. I didn't know whether she looked disappointed in me or if it was my mind playing tricks on me. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry beka.&quot; I said. The tears started to stream down my face. Tears of frustration and fear. Under normal circumstances I would have never hit Tyr. I would never hit any member of this crew. Beka stepped forward and wrapped her arms around me. <br>
<br>
&quot;Is it what you told me might happen if your data port started to malfunction?&quot; She whispered. I shook my head and she breathed in deeply. I felt like a 3-year-old. I sunk into her and found it ironic how I had lumped her with the rest when I was mentally badmouthing the crew when she is the only person with me right now when I'm at my lowest. She is the only person I could trust with my secret. She has always cared for me. <br>
<br>
&quot;I just lost control. I couldn't stop it.&quot; I said frantically. She rubbed my back, which soothed me. <br>
<br>
&quot;I know Harper. We have to get you to a doc.&quot; She said hesitantly. She was afraid to upset me. Afraid of what I might do. <br>
<br>
&quot;I know but the Maru is down. we'll go after I fix it.&quot; I said quietly. I lightly touched my data port. I had almost forgotten about the real reason I had gotten this cold metal attached to my brain and neck. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you really wanna wait? You really scared Tyr and Dylan back there. Even Trance is scared.&quot; Beka said wrenching me away from reminiscing. I frowned and looked down. I was shirtless, wearing only my pajama bottom. I looked across the room at my reflection in the mirror. That was me standing there...Seamus Z Harper but I knew without help it wouldn't stay that way. <br>
<br>
&quot;I know but we don't have any choice. The slipfighters are down and so is the Maru. The only other option is to take the Andromeda...Oh no Beka!&quot; I said realizing what she was getting at. It took me years to tell Beka. It took years and a lot of trust. I just can't tell anyone else and Beka knew that I would have to tell Dylan why we were gonna throw all caution to the wind so I can see a doc. I could feel a little pinch at the back of my neck and compounding rage. Beka's face shifted to this awful face that was filled with worry...the same face Tyr had given me in the engine room. Just before I had lost all control. <br>
<br>
&quot;Harper! Harper! Calm down!&quot; Beka shouted...But I couldn't control myself. I was running on autopilot. I picked up the closest thing to me and threw it. She ducked just in time and watched it shatter against the far wall. <br>
<br>
&quot;Noooo! Noooo! Just...just leave me alone!&quot; I said. My voice wavered with fear and mental exhaustion. <br>
<br>
&quot;You know I can't do that. I care to much.&quot; She said stepping forward. The rage continued to grow and everything was starting to go black. I had tunnel vision and I knew that if I completely blacked out I couldn't be held accountable for my actions. I flashed back to earth. I saw all those times when people were ready to kill me for things I didn't even remember doing. Mobs and hordes of people being held back by my parents pleads. <br>
<br>
&quot;No! no you don't! you don't care at all!&quot; I shouted. Deep in my heart I knew that wasn't the truth but I couldn't speak. It felt like I was looking through eyeholes in a sheet. Beka kept getting closer. I wanted her to run but I couldn't tell her. I could feel myself pacing, and ranting. <br>
<br>
&quot;Harper you know I care. I've never let you down and I don't plan on letting you down anytime in the future.&quot; She said laying a hand on my shoulder. I screamed out but she couldn't hear me. It never escaped the lips of...him. I remember him so well. My imaginary friend gone bad...my life gone bad. He started out so innocent, popping up when I needed him, like when I was afraid of the dark or afraid of the slumgangs. I thought it was normal, a boy and his imaginary friend, until I couldn't get rid of him...Until he started taking over. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have to get you to a doc...look at yourself! You don't wanna be like this do you?&quot; Beka continued. She pointed to the mirror. I gasped internally, staring at the rage creased face that stared back at me. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come on Harper...you trusted me enough to tell me...trust me enough to have your best interest at heart.&quot; She wrapped her arms around me and slowly guided me to the floor. Hesitantly my body followed. My breathing calmed and the tunnel became wider and wider until I had full control over my own body. <br>
<br>
&quot;Will you please let me tell Dylan so we can go see the doc right away?&quot; She said rocking me back and forth. She was so loving. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ok&quot; I whispered back. <br>
<br>

I watched beka tiptoe through my room with one shoe in her hand. I could tell she was looking for the other, kicking around the mess I had created during the several tantrums I had last night. She had stayed with me through the night helping me when I cried and soothing me when I yelled. Tears gathered in my eyes just thinking about how devoted a friend Beka...Captain Beka Valentine was. She finally found her shoe and crept over. She watched me while I pretended to be sleep. I didn’t' want her to have to explain why she was leaving, I already knew why. She was leaving to explain to Dylan that I was crazy, over morning coffee. She would tell him that I had a sever form multiple personality disorder and that I have had it since I was 9. She would tell him how my data port was installed when I was 15 to suppress…my altar… and how it was malfunctioning. She would also have to tell him that I couldn't go to just any doc to get this fixed but the one who had installed my data port in the first place. Using a data port to suppress an altar personality was an experiment that only Dr. Keets ventured into. To her misfortune she would have to be there when he exploded in frustrating. She would have to tell him that he resides on the hell whole called earth and that we would have to find a way there before the neural components of my implant are absorbed by my brain. She sighed heavily in rhythm with my mental sigh. She kissed my forehead and left the room leaving me to my thoughts. I couldn't believe that I was dealing with this again. This issue of sanity. It just didn't seem real. I hadn't had...him here to bother me in 10 years. His presence has brought all my childhood memories flooding back much to my horror. I can remember how my parents use to cry. Every night wondering what was wrong with me and I use to cry cause I didn't have an answer. <br>
<br>
He started out as my imaginary friend named Shane. He would be there to protect me and give me encouraging words when I was frightened. I couldn't wait for my mom to tuck me into bed at night cause when she closed the door Shane would be there and we'd talk and jump on the bed...even though we weren't suppose to.  He was my hieght and age. Short and thin just like me. His eyes were a piercing blue and his hair was long and brown. His features were somewhat feminine, his chin was slinder and his hands were little and petite. He always wore the same clothes, dirty brown pants and a huge shirt that hung off of him leaving his chest exposed through the huge neck hole.  The memory made me smile but it soon turned into a frown when I remembered how he had drastically changed. One day out of the blue he started to talk for me and I couldn't make him go away. I remember I was standing in front of the slumgang. They had caught me coming home from the little makeshift market the Anderson’s had made about a 10 minuet walk from my house. I tried to hide the bread I had bought behind my back but they saw it anyway. I can still remember how scared I was, how my teeth chattered cause I was trembling so hard. There was over 20 of them and then there was a 9-year-old me. Standing there shaking in my filthy rags. I could hear Shane talking in the back of my head which wasn't unusual. He was always there when I was scared but this time he wasn't telling me to run he was telling me to tell them off. I was too afraid to open my mouth or to even run. They kept advancing on my position. Fliping out pocketknives, shives and pipes. Shane started to yell but I couldn’t respond. Then all of a sudden my body wasn't mine...I wasn't controlling anything. Words came poring out of my mouth and the gang became instantly enraged. I tried to stop myself but I couldn't. I got the courage to run but my legs wouldn't move. He kept talking and they finally had had enough. They tackled me to the ground and beat me till I couldn’t' stand and then they beat me some more. They didn't even bother to take the bread when they were done. Beating me seemed to satisfy them enough. I sat there in my own blood...spitting out my teeth and wondering what had happened. I can still remember what Shane said to me.<br>
<br>
&quot;You deserved to be beaten...If you never stand up for yourself you will always be the victim. And anyway look.... You still have the bread.&quot; He stood over me with his hands on his hips. He smiled wildly and reached out his hand to help me up. I just stared at him covering my bloody mouth. They had slit the corners of my mouth...they said to keep me from talking  so much next time. I whimpered loudly and Shane frowned deeply. His eyes squinted and he threw his long brown hair over his slender shoulder. <br>
<br>
&quot;You’re so pathetic. I have to do everything for you! You would have just taken that! Don't you see...That was the only way to keep the bread...So your hurt...Get over it!&quot; He yelled. His face became pale and his eyes turned from blue to a deep void like black. His nose flared in disgust and he slowly stepped toward me. I tried to move...I tried to get away from him but my legs were broken and my ribs ached when I breathed. The agony I was in was surpassed by my extreme fear of my own imaginary friend. He didn't seem so imaginary anymore...He didn't seem like much of a friend anymore. He knelt down inches from me and shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I always thought you were weak. I just hoped you’d grow out of it.&quot; He said and then he sunk into me like a ghost. I felt a strange pinch at the base of my skull and my vision narrowed. My skin felt tingly and I couldn’t help but shiver. I looked down to see all the blood I had lost. I could hear my mom calling my name in the distance. Someone must have told her what happened and I was relieved. I noticed the crowd that had formed around me. There hands covering their mouths in shock. At first I thought they were mocking me but I realized that they were horrified at my mangled state. I didn't seem to feel the pain All I saw were there faces and all I heard was my mom calling my name over and over. A voice interrupted it all, a voice deep in my mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Run to mama.&quot; He whispered and then laughed. I knew at that moment I had to get rid of him. I knew he was dangerous. My mom finally made it to me, kicking up dust with her rapid approach.  She tried to move me but I screamed out in agony uncovering my blood filled mouth. She stopped and gasped grabbing my chin and examining the damage. A river of tears ran down her face and were soaked up by her shirt.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Get Mr. Keets! Get Mr. Keets!&quot; She screamed over and over. No one moved so she screamed louder pulling everyone's attention away from me to her important words. The crowd dispersed running in different directions screaming for the Mr. Keets. Most mumbled and went on their way never looking back. She rocked me and rubbed my back and I sunk into her. No one could soothe me like she could. I could feel her tears fall into my blond bloodied hair. The last thing I remembered as I looked down at my hands was wondering how much time had past cause the blood on my hands had hardened and flaked. Then everything went black. <br>
<br>
I realize now why Beka was able to soothe me. She reminded me so much of my mother. I shook the memory away and forced myself out of bed. I ran my hands through my hair and stretched. I could feel a slight hum in the back of my mind and I knew Shane would soon have something to say. There was a knock on my door and I debated on answering. I didn't wanna talk to Dylan. Even though I knew it was necessary. The knock came again and I opened the door mindlessly only to find who I thought would be at the door wasn't. I opened my mouth to gasp but was yanked from the room with an extreme force. I closed my eyes against the harsh bright lights of the corridor. My back slammed into the far wall knocking all the wind out of me and making my eyes snap back open. I slid to the floor agonizing over my back and wiping the spit that had flown out of my mouth off my chin. Tyr stood in the doorway of my room just staring at me. He seemed to move in slow motion, his hair gently swaying before finding their resting-place. His face dropped into a tight grimace and a loud growl rumbled in his throat. My eyes drifted  from his face down his flexed muscles to the broken bone spurs on his bandaged forearm. He followed my gaze and when I looked up he was even angrier then before. I lifted my hands to cover my face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sooo sorry Tyr! I didn't mean it. I couldn't stop myself. It was an accident.&quot; I rambled incoherently. My fear had stopped all blood flow to my brain apparently. What do you say to an angry nietzschean? Obviously sorry wasn't it. He grabbed me and roughly pulled me to my feet putting excruciating pressure on my collarbone with his grip. Disembodied whispers filled my mind and I tried to shut them out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tyr please forgive me! I'm really sorry...Those will grow back right?&quot; I said with an awkward laugh. He roared and revved back sending me flying against the wall. I grabbed my chest and wheezed weakly. <br>
<br>
&quot;I guess that's a no.&quot; I said under my breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tyr. You seriously don't wanna play this game with me.&quot; I said feeling an aura of power come over me. I knew what was happening and I didn't know who to be more afraid of. Shane or Tyr? Tyr once again reached down for me and in a flash I swept him off his feet and onto his ass with an oomph.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soo...breaking the ones on your left arm wasn't enough? Let’s try your right!&quot; Shane had taken over. I yelled in my mind for Shane to stop but he kept struggling with Tyr. Punching and kicking him while he was on the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;You’re so pathetic!&quot; he screamed at me and punched Tyr in his face. I had had enough. My body is my body! I’m not that 9-year-old anymore! I struggled to regain control, throwing Shane off balance. We tossed back and forth between control. The pain in my head was excruciating. I screamed out holding my temples and stumbling like a drunk. Tyr could have taken advantage of my instability but he just watched quietly. His eyes were as big as saucers. <br>
<br>
“Ohh god. Tyr help me.” I said trying to blink away this horror that was tugging at my brain. My voice pleaded with him and my eyes filled with tears. I couldn’t do this alone. I needed help. I stumbled toward Tyr like an infant learning to walk. I was using all my energy fighting for control that I had lost motor skills. Tyr scooted away from me, eyeing me with disgust.<br>
<br>
“Get Beka…please!” I said between sorrowful wails. I gritted my teeth feeling my control breaking down rapidly. It felt like I had bolted a door to keep him out and he was bursting through. I wanted Beka to rub my back and tell me it would be ok. I needed her support.<br>
<br>
“You can’t keep me in here forever.” Shane said laughing hysterically. His light childlike voice was misleading. <br>
<br>
“I CAN TRY!” I screamed staring at ceiling in agony. My face felt stretched and worn from holding this grimace so long.<br>
<br>
“Who looks like a lunatic now…your talking to yourself you idiot. And look at Tyr…he won’t even lift a finger to help.”<br>
<br>
“What is wrong with you!” Tyr bellowed slowly getting to his feet. He inched away with each step getting bigger then the last. From his vantage point this must have seemed ridicules. I had to remember that they didn’t know about Shane…They didn’t know about my disorder. This was all new to them. I opened my mouth to explain but ended up biting down on my lip to keep Shane from speaking. I could tell Shane wasn’t as strong as he use to be or he would have taken me over completely without hesitation…like he use to. But I also knew that if I didn’t get help he would soon take over my life completely. I couldn’t keep this up forever. I was exhausted. Sweat covered my body and my eyes rolled around in my head. I fell to my knees swaying from side to side. That hypothetical door was hanging on by a thread. I couldn’t hold him back any longer. <br>
<br>
“What’s going on!?” Dylan asked when Tyr backed into him, startling the freaked out neit. <br>
<br>
“Harper is a lunatic.”  Tyr said pointing at me as if he were tattling. I lifted my eyes. All I heard was a white noise in the background. There was someone next to Dylan. I squinted to see who it was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Humm...I see its shay and his little friend &quot;shame&quot; back together again.&quot; The man beside Dylan said. I couldn’t believe what I saw. My mind flashed back to all the times I had encountered the slumgang. Oh My God it was him. The leader! In all my shock I failed to notice the hot shiver running up my spine. I heard a loud snap that rang in my ears. That sound was all too familiar. The darkness glazed over my eyes. I was to tired to fight.<br>
<br>
“No.” I said weakly before the light at the end of the tunnel disappeared.<br>

<br>
The sensation I felt was strange…it felt like someone had turned me on with a flip of a switch and my body was trying to manage the sudden surge of power… My brain felt foggy and my nose ached. I looked down just in time to see the red liquid drip down in a long pouring stream landing on my pants. I quickly reached up but not before I was tackled fiercely to the ground…The lightspeed jarring instantly made me flash back to a 9 year-old me being tackled by the slumgangs. I flailed my arms wildly as the person struggled to restrain me. It was strange, this moment was the first time Shane hadn't been around when I was afraid and I was quit relieved. I struggled with my eyes fused shut. I refused to see the leader of the slumgangs….straddling me and preparing to do what he had done before. I was quickly restrained and I grimaced knowing pain was next on the agenda.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait! Wait! Har…Harper?&quot; A voice called. It couldn't be anyone else but Beka. <br>
<br>
I opened my eyes and blinked away the blur of confusion. I was overwhelmingly disoriented and my head felt like it weight a ton.  A big shadow was in my direct line of vision so I squinted to figure out what it was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan?&quot; I said as the tall and heavy man stopped struggling with me and stared wildly. He straddled my hips and his weight was crushing me making me feel like I was becoming part of the grating. My eyes continued to adjust but slowly.  I could see his right eye was turning a deep shade of purple and he struggled to breathe letting out a gurgling wheeze. I knew right away that that was Shane’s doing.  I looked past Dylan to a very scared and worried Beka. Lines of stress and worry had crept around her eyes and mouth making her appear older then she was.  Dylan stared angrily at me as the gravity made the blood from my nose slid down my cheek and into my ear annoyingly. It made me remember the many nights when I use to cry myself to sleep staring at the ceiling and fruitlessly wishing Shane would just disappear one day. I use to pray, plead and beg for him to just pack his things and leave never to return. I use to cry so long and so hard that the redundancy of wiping tears that I knew would gather again would dawn on me and I would just let them run their course, They’d slide down my cheek and into my ear making me flinch with annoyance but not breaking me out of my woeful mood enough to wipe them away. Dylan loosened his grip on my wrists only to pick up the force lance beside me and aim. My body tensed and my mind stilled. His face was like steel. His lips were tight and his chin was held high…like she was trying to regain the dignity that Shane had stripped from him. His chest heaved and I could tell the anger was building to critical levels. Beka slowly walked up to Dylan and grabbed his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper is that you?&quot; She said and I nodded slowly never taking my eyes off of Dylan. Somehow she could tell when I was back when no one else could….just like my mother could. I was so frightened to learn of what I might have done or said…What Shane might have done. I wanted to cry but with the look on Dylan’s face and this force lance pointed at my head…shitting my pants seemed like the more appropriate thing to do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan….&quot; I said but he quickly shushed me stuffing the force lance into my eye agonizingly…He shuddered with both pain and unrelenting anger which made the force lance dig deeper into my socket.  I arched my back somehow thinking that might ease the pain, when in fact it didn't help at all. I took a quick intake of air leaving my mouth gaping in shock. Would he shoot?<br>
<br>
“Dylan stop! He couldn't help it! IT WASN'T HIM!” She said she screamed close to tears.  Whatever I had done had been bad enough for Beka to worry that Dylan might actually fire that weapon into my eye through my head and through this floor. I didn't know if that was good or bad…I didn't want to face what I had done and what I might have said. I was never a fan of suicide but this was one of those times when Black Death would be preferred over this cold living. His icy glare was terrible and I wish he’d just shoot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Like hell it wasn't him! So it wasn't him to gave me this black eye and these broken ribs. It wasn't him whoslapped you around and called you a whore , and it wasn't him who shot Drake.&quot; His words hit me like a ton of bricks. I had shot someone? I had hit beka?<br>
<br>
&quot;I…I…&quot; I stuttered…I needed something to say in my defense but there wasn't anything I could say. Drake? He must have been the man who was here before I blacked out. It took me awhile to figure out who it was that stood beside Dylan. He was a tall man. He wore all black and his skin was a dark bronze. His smile triggered my memory. That same smile that had prompted so much fear that I later found was justified when I was 9. The leader of the hellgang…the slumgang.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is he dead.&quot; I whispered slowly and softly. Forgetting about the weapon jabbed in my eye just long enough to get the words out.<br>
<br>
&quot;DO YOU WANT HIM DEAD!!?” Dylan yelled furiously. Spit flew from his mouth and his eye seemed to turn a shade darker which only made me feel worse. I had beaten up my captain and my friend…the only friend I really trusted and I had shot someone.<br>
<br>
&quot;NO! PLEASE…I'M SORRY…I …I ..IT WASN'T ME …&quot; I said pitifully. Beka spoke up from behind Dylan. Her voice was quiet as if she wasn’t sure whether she should be sticking up for me or ramming her own force lance in my other eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper has a sever case of …split personality disorder. Dylan…it wasn't him&quot; She said again pleadingly. I noticed the blood smeared  on Dylan’s fist and realized that he was the one who had given me the bloody nose. I had assumed it was him but that was the proof. He still sat…straddling my hips snorting and clenching his teeth in anger he pulled the force lance away from my eye but my socket still felt like something large was stuffed in it. He dropped the lance next to him and it clattered on the floor noisily breaking the awkward silence momentarily. He hung his head and his breathing was the only sound.  He revved his fist back and came down hard. I braced for impact and heard his fist smack loudly onto the hollow grated floor inches from my head. He roared angrily and picked himself up off of me gingerly…holding his ribs and exhaling the pain. What had I done…he done? <br>
<br>
&quot;Split personality…&quot; He whispered…his gaze now seemed distant. He stood a few feet away from me looking down at me like he had just scrapped me off the bottom of his shoe. I looked away but I could still feel his eye burning into me. <br>
<br>
&quot; LOOK AT ME HARPER!&quot; He screamed uncharacteristically. I would have taken slavery any day over seeing that much disappointment on his face. <br>
<br>
&quot;THIS IS THE DAMAGE YOU'VE CAUSED!&quot; He continued sorely. He pressed his neck communicator<br>
<br>
“Rommie…Take Mr. Harper to the Med Deck. Confine him to a bed until further notice. When he’s secure have Trance look him over.”  I shuddered at his words and the even-ness of his tone. He’d said confine. I knew what that meant that meant being strapped down to the bed like a lunatic. The only problem was I was a lunatic and shane had gotten out of restraints before.<br>
<br>
“Dylan I think you should get looked at too.” Beka said only to get a twisted gaze from Dylan in return.<br>
<br>
“I will, I just need to think some things through first.” He said crossing his arms. <br>
<br>
“I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.” I kept saying but the damage was done. I knew both me and Beka were in hot water. And the things he needed to think through would be our stay on this ship. I looked at Beka and she instantly looked away. Usually I can stand the cold shoulder but not from Beka…it felt like I had disappointed my surrogate mother. Hot bile rose in my throat as I thought about the possibilities of what I had done and what I was capable of.  My vision had cleared and I realized where I was. I was on the Maru. How did I get here? I have no clue. Footsteps came rushing up and both Beka and Dylan turned to see an irate Tyr running with his biggest gun already powered up and ready. Shitting my pants seemed more and more like the right thing to do. Dylan stopped him of course…he might have hated me, found me a loose cannon, an annoying and seemingly dangerous piece of work but he was still captain. <br>
<br>
“The situation has been neutralized.” Dylan said. The rest of his words were only for Tyr. He whispered and Tyr’s eyes squinted at me as if to say “one day little man. Watch your back.” I squirmed a little under his gaze only making him visibly tighten his grip on his gun. I stilled immediately. I wiped the blood from my face and tried without luck to get the blood out of my ear. Rommie plus two Maria bots showed up to carry me away to my interrogation. I would have to explain what Shane was, who he was, and why he caused so much damage. The real question would be why I didn’t warn him about this…this possible risk to his ship and his mission. I knew Dylan well enough to know that he would milk as much info from Trance and Beka before actually talking to me. And between the both of them he’d find that I was a lunatic and needed to be confined to quarter and later thrown out of an air lock into magog space. Rommie grabbed me coldly and yanked me to my feet. I hadn’t expected her to be nice…I had hurt her Captian. The walk to med deck was long and tooo quiet. <br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Dylans Pov 2 hours later<br>
<br>
I sat in the observation deck. Anger welling up and making my throat tight. <br>
<br>
“split personality disorder?” I scoffed. It seemed ridiculous but I looked up the disorder anyway. It cleared up why Harper had looked so menacing. I remember I had to catch a gasp in my throat when I saw him look up from under his lashes and stare at Drake. What was it about Drake that got to him? I don’t know…all I know is that he was on him in a flash. A fury  of fists and kicks connecting astonishingly fast and amazingly accurate. I jumped in the fight to tear Harper off but it only seemed to enrage him…before I could even think of drawing my weapon Harper had turned his attack on me. It seemed like I had the size advantage but he used my size against me, catching me off balance when I lashed out. I flinched just thinking of the beating I had gotten from my once quirky engineer. He seemed like a different person…he was a different person. He skillfully beat me down talking and mumbling the whole time about the corruption of the commonwealth and about my supposed superiority complex. He grabbed my force lance from my holster whirled around and shot Drake instantly sending him into a screaming pain riddled ball heaped pitifully against the wall. Harper laughed this laugh that I could never forget. It didn’t’ even sound like it could possible come from him…this high pitched scream of a laugh. It sickened me to see him hunched over in laughter after shooting someone. Beka ran up from behind him and tried to restrain him only to be pushed away….He laughed and revved back his arm only to stop inches from her face. His face softened considerably for a second and the ambiance was strangely captivating. He looked around like he had just remembered something important, grinned,  and ran down the corridor dodging Tyrs attacks. Beka ran over to me and I waved her off and pointed to Drake. She checked his pulse and called Trance to pick him up because I was too winded to make that order.<br>
<br>
“Tyr. Get reinforcements” I had said…obviously fighting wasn’t going to take him down. Tyr jogged off and I stumbled to my feet following behind an irate yet scared Beka. Her eyes seemed to know what was happening.<br>
<br>
“Andromeda Locate Mr Harper”  I crocked. <br>
<br>
“Harper has just entered the Maru and is out of my sensor range.”  She said evenly in her typical Rommie tone. Beka looked at me and ran full force for the docking bay. If anyone could hack the Maru and steal her it was Harper. We finally made it onto the Maru only to stumble into Harper’s trap. I didn’t know what hit me. All I knew was that I fell and I fell hard. My chest felt caved in and I couldn’t move or get air. Harper grabbed Beka by the hair masterfully. She struggled but Harper blocked all punches and grabbed her by her hair again. She grunted in both pain and surprise and her face balled up with the effort to keep up with Harper’s long strides. <br>
<br>
“Give me the access codes.” He said evenly. I couldn’t’ see them at this point…I could barely breathe. They had turned the corner but I could hear them just fine. Beka refused and Harper demanded more firmly doing something to make Beka yelp out and ignite me with energy. I stumbled to my feet grabbing my swollen chest and stepping over the pipe I assumed Harper had used to do this damage. I knew a rib was broken but Beka’s yelp continued to burn in my heart. <br>
<br>
“Give me the Codes you stupid whore!” He shouted….I wondered where the hell tyr was when you needed him. I picked up the pipe only to find that harper had taken beka’s weapon and had it aimed and ready for my entry…I ducked just in time to miss my head getting shot off. The quick movement made some of my ribs shift and I moaned with blinding pain <br>
<br>
“Come on Dylan. Why do you always have to be the hero!” His voice was a high pitched child like voice. Light yet psychotic. Shivers of old fears came back…his voice reminded me of monsters under my bed and witches in my closet. <br>
<br>
“Harper! What the hell is this about! Let beka go!” <br>
<br>
“ohh you wanna negotiate huh?”<br>
<br>
“How about you tell Beka to give me the codes! I'll blow her brains out if you don't” He said mockingly<br>
<br>
“Let her go Harper!” I screamed and he laughed again…I shuddered. I pushed my neck communicator and whispered to rommie.<br>
<br>
“Rommie I need you to remove the AG field from this docking bay and vent the coolent tanks on deck 19.” I knew the act of releasing the coolent tanks would be enough to rock anyone who wasn't inside an AG field anyone who was inside one would barely feel a thing.<br>
<br>
“Acknowledged” <br>
<br>
There was a moment of silence then the Maru rocked violently sending all three of us flying in all different directions. I slid on the floor and in all the confusion grabbed wildly for the forcelance that had fell from harpers hand. Harper slowly stood and I punched him without hesitation bloodying his nose. He fell back and then stood on wobbly legs...He looked around dazed and confused but I wasn’t done with him yet..I tackled him and then lost all control over my anger. I shook my head at how utterly angry I was that he had shot a man, attacked me, and treated beka like a piece of shit. <br>
<br>
I sat here in the obs deck awaiting Beka and Trance’s arrivel. If any two people could explain in depth what just happened they could. I could here there tentative footsteps behind me.<br>
<br>
“I’m disappointed in both of you.” I began. I rubbed the bridge of my nose and suppressed the need to scream and punch and kick and all out beat the holy shit out of both of them.<br>
<br>
“You have not only compromised my ship, and my mission, but also the health and wellbeing of this crew.”  I stood and turned so they  can see the spreading brousies and cuts on my face and arms.  Trance drew back a little and I could tell she was in disbelief that her little engeenier could do something like this.<br>
<br>
“I know that both of you knew about this…Knew there was a problem and you took lengths to keep this information from me.” Trance pipped up.<br>
<br>
“Dylan all I knew was that he was moody so I diagnosed him with manic depression and prescribed some meds accordingly….He never told me he was violent and on the meds he seemed fine, He didn’t seem like a threat.” She said letting her words drift.<br>
<br>
“And you Beka?” <br>
<br>
“I had promised him Dylan” Beka said matter of factly which made me boil over with rage.<br>
<br>
“So your promise means more to you then the lives of this crew!” <br>
<br>
“I never thought it would come to this! He told me he had split personality disorder just in case something like this ever happened…..just in case.”<br>
<br>
“Why is this happening now??”<br>
<br>
“His data port was installed when he was 15 not only to give him an advantage as an engineer but to suppress his alter…Shane. But now it’s malfunctioning and his disorder is back. I tired to tell you about it in the café…but Rommie called you to the bridge before I had the chance”<br>
<br>
“Shane…” I scoffed and paced in front of them.<br>
<br>
“He’s had split personality disorder since he was 9. He wanted to just forget about it and live his life. He never thought this would happen…he just told me just in case.  He needs to get to a doc and get his data port fixed before his disorder gets worse.” <br>
<br>
“Worse?”<br>
<br>
“Before Shane takes over completely.”<br>
<br>
“I have never heard of a procedure like this.” I said exasperated<br>
<br>
“That’s because Harper is probably the only person to ever go through the procedure and a Dr. Keets from earth is the only doctor who can do the procedure.”<br>
<br>
“That’s funny…Drakes last name is keets.” I mumbled more to myself then anyone else.<br>
<br>
“What’s Drakes condition?” I asked a startled Trance. I could tell that this was the first time she had ever heard about Harper's disorder and she was trying to let it all sink in.<br>
<br>
“He’s fine, The nanobots have almost completely healed the wound.” She said innocently. Her tail winding around mindlessly beside her.<br>
<br>
“And Harper” I said micro breathing so my ribs wouldn't expand.<br>
<br>
“Physically he’s fine.  But he’s really quiet…can tell he’s really sorry. From what Rommis told me I didn't think it would be a good idea for him to be in the same room with Drake so I put him in the back.” I nodded my understanding and felt a wave of dizziness sweep over me. In all my anger I had almost forgotten about the extent on my injuries.<br>
<br>
“Dylan….I think you should come to med lab too…” She said more like a question then a statement. I was still angry but I couldn't help but smile at Trance. She constantly tired to avoid conflict…every statement was a suggestion rather then a command or  something matter of fact. I gathered myself once again remembering the pain. I nodded to her and she walked over to help me. Beka attempted to come my way but the anger and disappointment I let gravitate to my face stopped her in her tracks. She was my first officer and her duty was to tell me of any threats. She had overlooked her duty because of a personal relationship and I wasn’t going to have that on my ship.<br>
<br>
“Beka you are confined to quarters until further notice.” I said over my shoulder as Trance struggled to get me to med deck.<br>
<br>
“Why am I confined to quarters!” She said loudly and with disregard to my rank she walked up to me and placed her hand defiantly on her hips.<br>
<br>
“You’re confined to quarters because you withheld information that could have prevented this situation. Instead of telling me of Harpers condition you hid it. Beka…This isn’t a game. You can’t tell me after the damage is done to beware…it’s to late now…if anyone is responsible for this….it’s you. You have intentionally neglected your duties as first officer and there for relieved of duty.” I said evenly. I had learned that getting worked up with Beka only made her feel more in control. If I stayed in control and didn’t let her rudeness sway me, my words would have more meaning.<br>
<br>
“I understand” She said letting her hands slid from her waist. Her eyes searched the surrounding area…any excuse not to look at me. Trance tugged gently and I followed. I felt sore and broken.  I finally entered med lab to see Harper bound tightly to a table with a maria bot standing close by. <br>
<br>
<br>
Harper’s Pov<br>
<br>
I looked over to see Dylan being ushered in by Trance. The bruises had spread to there full size and I grimaced at the thought that I had beaten my captain mercilessly. I wanted to say something but I didn’t think it would help so I stayed quiet. The restraints dug deeply into my wrists and ankles thanks to Rommie’s lose of bedside manner. I knew she was so angry with me she could kill me herself.  I had finally completely wigged out and I had lost the trust of every member of this ship. There was a slight hum in the back of my mind. He was there…waiting for me to put my guard down. He was like a scavenger…feeding off my used emotions. Oddly I wondered if my hair was ok and I chuckled inwardly at the stupidity of my thoughts. Laughter is the best medicine I thought. Dylan gingerly laid down on the table next to mine, about 5 feet away. He couldn’t look at me and I could tell his breathing and pulse had quickened from the sheer sight of me. I was numb. A part of me new this was what happens when your mentally insane, it knew how this would play out. Just like how my other relationships played out were people run away screaming aimlessly into the night. The other part of me really didn’t’ want to lose this. I had made a good life here. That part wasn’t ready to give up. I heard a noise from the back and I shifted my gaze to the other side of the  room. A man sauntered in looking pale and spent. I struggled against my restraints….my first reaction was to run. It was Drake. I hadn’t killed him…my shock gave Shane a little leeway and once again I bolted the door and he banged and begged to be let out. <br>
<br>
“You shot me Shay…Nice to see you too…We’ve got a few things to discuss.” His face seemed to crack in the middle horizontally and those big teeth shone through frighteningly.<br>
<br>
<br>
