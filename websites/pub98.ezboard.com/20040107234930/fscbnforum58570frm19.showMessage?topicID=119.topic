The theatre, designed for acted performances, orchestra, but mostly opera, has been set apart for the Paris city Orchestra's third world tour.<br>
<br>
  The design of the theatre is based in late seventeenth century Italy, with gold lacquered pillars, intricately filigreed, reaching to the ceiling, balconies, and lush burgundy curtains. One would, if standing alone, consider the opera house haunted with memories of Tuscany and Roma. <br>
<br>
  The Paris City Orchestra has a strong background in France, but has since traveled England, Germany, Greece, Japan, Korea, and more recently, the US. During their travels, they have performed with various soloists; Gay Yee Westerhoff, Haylie Ecker, Lakatos, Nobuo Uematsu, Riccardo Muti, Sylvia Du Riche; both pianists and violists.<br>
<br>
  The performance itself is substantial; enough work has been put into it to more than attract the House of the Rose, but is musically technical enough to bore some. The orchestra's strongest point it's smooth, well-timed gorgeous sound, mostly emitting from the string section- the peices selected; Mozart, Puccini, Schmann, are strongest there.<br>
<br>
  After an hour and an intermission, the director of the performance introduces a piece unlike most of the previous repertoire. The overtura* from La mia Verita, Se Il mio amore sta Vicino, the director explains, was written about a noble lady in the court of an English prince. The lady had a curse; any man she loved and married her would die. Of course, she and the Prince fell in love. Ultimately, the King forbade their marriage and the noble lady accepted her execution with graciousness and love. <br>
<br>
  The director then lights up with a smile, introducing, thanking, and welcoming a Miss Sylvia Du Riche to this evening's performance. He lists a small amount of her accomplishments, mainly her stronger ones. He then exits off a small staircase leading to the floor level, as a woman arises from the violin sub-section. <br>
<br>
  The woman is tall, golden-haired, and pale; her lips are painted a dusky red. She appears to be in her mid twenties, and carries herself with grace born of practice. She wears a simple, long black velvet dress with spaghetti straps and a suggestive slit up the back. The dress hugs her curvaceous body, a sash of a thick silver silk is neatly wrapped around her neck, and long black velvet opera gloves to match. Her makeup is light, revealing her facial structure, distinctly French. <br>
<br>
  A gracious applause accepts Sylvia onto the stage, and a prompt spotlight follows. She walks lightly up the eight steps to the stage, and the clapping peters gently. <br>
<br>
  She removes her violin from it's case, while the Orchestra gives itself a last minute tune. The violin itself is a deep brown, shimmering in the dark red of cherry-wood. Upon closer inspection, one would see the violin is worn at the edges, but also that it looks very old, and is well kept for it's age. Something you might find in an antique store. <br>
<br>
  She picks up her violin and holds it beneath her chin, and the tuning instruments shush themselves. The conductor raises his baton to begin.<br>
<br>
  The orchestra strikes, and suddenly everybody is paying attention. The soloist plays a few notes in a upward shrill climb, and the piece picks up. It's sad, romantic peice... not slow enough to make you cry, but the kind the wrenches your heart and demands your attention. For a few minutes, the violinist plays along with the orchestra, a few additional notes added here and there.<br>
<br>
  The piece builds, then hushes to a dead quiet. In rhythm, the violinist picks up her solo. If the piece so far had been a story, her stanzas would have been a monologue. <br>
<br>
  It begins slower than the rest of it, in the same key, but placed off of the rest of the music, introduced differently. It flows into a flurry of notes, growing and dying from the top of a violin's range to the bottom, the extended notes sounding like the mournful cries of a woman.<br>
<br>
  On a technical level, her style was a mix of the crying, haunting gypsy sound and the classic French, but on a more musical level the solo rose, fell and flowed with expertise, one could say it spoke, danced, cried. Staccato placed between the long notes gave it varied flavour as it sped along. Sylvia showed nothing but focus; mostly, her eyes had been closed, letting the music flow from her soul rather than from the sheet music. Now they were open, distant, but intensely focused. At a close inspection, her eyes might have given an enraged focus; her body stayed poised and graceful, though not at all calm. <br>
<br>
  As she reached the end of solo, her violin ascended higher, higher, racing through to the very finish. The very last assertive, delicate note, sung out to the audience in high pitch.<br>
<br>
  The piece continued at the whim of her conclusion, with an occasional brief pause for a violin's solo stanza. The conductor payed fierce attention to the soloists rhythm, without loosing sight of his conducting, and managed, though skill, to keep up with her. <br>
<br>
  The piece slowly dies out, the orchestra holding a low, steady note as Sylvia executes the extended, hauntingly beautiful filigree ending. It plays just a moment longer than the rest of the orchestra. <br>
<br>
  She raises her bow away from her violin, and the audience erupts into violent applause. Those in the front rows are the first to give standing ovation; recognizable kin of the Rose if one is paying attention. (In fact, kin and ghoul are occasionally recognized, if one so wishes, among the crowd.) <br>
<br>
  Now calm, Sylvia gives a deep, dramatic bow to the audience. She smiles graciously, and motions to the conductor and orchestra, which stand to bow. The applause does not die at it's que, and the lithe soloist bows, appropriately flattered. She again motions to the orchestra, which she applauds for herself. <br>
<br>
  Looking up to a balcony on the second floor just to the left, she nods (smiles?) at the Primogen of the Rose and her cities' Keeper, acknowledging their gracious presence. <br>
<br>
  The audience shuffles out into the front ball room, where wine and refreshments are being served. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  If you wish to speak with Sylvia:<br>
<br>
  You proceed around to the back of the opera house to find a single door, manned by a professional looking guard/usher, dressed in the formal uniform you saw inside. He stops you.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I'm sorry, but I cannot allow you inside-- Miss Du Riche is not accepting visitors at this time. However, if you wish to leave a message, I'll gladly deliver it for you...&quot;<br>
<br>

He smiles slightly and ask politely if a note could be given to Sylvia Du Riche.  He waits for one of the men to take the note. As the two men continue to stand there Creed smiles slightly again and states &quot;Please deliver the note now.&quot; The man with the note seems nervous and taps on the door.  When no reply comes he looks back at Creed and states he will deliver the note later.  Smiling slightly again Creed leans toward the man with the note and saids &quot;I would consider it a personal favor if you slide in and drop that note off on her table.  Appearing to be more polite to Creed the man with the note.  Slides into the room and puts the note on the table.  He returns and for the first time smiles back at Creed.  &quot;Thank you, now that was not that hard was it?&quot; Creed says as he turns and smiles slightly back at the two men.  <br>
<br>
Note saids:   Your performance was very moving.  I have not listen to or viewed such beauty in a long time.  It would be a honor and a privilege to be able to see you at your earliest available time.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=119.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=119.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm20">SchreckNET™ (Nos only)<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
