<br>
Good morning, my name is Norman Kaplan. I am CEO of Calcol, Inc. We are traded Over the Counter under the symbol CLCL. My position is Chairman and President of the company. We are a holding company for China Investments and our business is entirely within China, selling within China, to the China market.<br>
<br>
Our principle business is an 80% ownership of a soft drink bottling plant in Beijing, China. We have an operating and fully licensed concentrate plant, one of only three in China. Coca Cola has one concentrate plant, Pepsi Cola has a concentrate plant and Calcol, Inc. has a concentrate plant. We manufacture orange, lemon lime, cherry cola, green apple, and of course cola, and we are soon going to introduce diet cola.<br>
 <br>
Currently, we are manufacturing those concentrates under license from an American company under confidentiality, and we are bottling and selling those products throughout Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei province – a region of 50 million people – through major supermarket chains and distributors to peddlers throughout the region. We have just begun selling within the last three to six months and our sales are very strong.<br>
<br>
A bottling plant, which is 110,000 sq. ft., is nearing final completion. We purchased for cash, from a supplier of Coca Cola Company in Mexico and other major manufacturers, a bottling line capable of manufacturing 6 million standard cases per year. A standard case is 24 x 8 oz. bottles and normally a bottling company earns between 90 cents and US$1.10 per standard case, gross operating profit. <br>
 <br>
We think that our net profits may be significant even within the first year of operations. We have a low cost production, our bottling plant is fully paid, we have no debt, and we are fully funded. Within the past three to six months, we've raised two and a quarter million dollars and have one and a quarter million dollars in reserve. Our products also may include diet cola. We're selling primarily liter-and-a-quarter bottles and we are going to introduce 600 ml bottles over the summer.<br>
<br>
Those are the products and services that we offer. We have this third license out of three for foreign branded soft drinks in China. The other two are held by Coke and Pepsi, and within the next couple of years, we hope to open at least two more bottling plants, one in the south to serve Guangzhou province, Zhuhai, Canton (Guangdong), Hong Kong, Macau, and Shenzhen, and we also hope to open a third plant in Jiangsu province to serve Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangkow, Soochow, and all of Jiangsu province<br>
 <br>
What makes us unique is that we are the most efficient, low-cost provider of high quality American soft drinks in China. For more information, please visit our Web site www.calcol.com or www.malibu-cola.com.cn . Thank you. This is Norman Kaplan, Chairman and President, Calcol Inc., traded Over the Counter in the United States under the symbol CLCL. <br>

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES<br>
 <br>
  BEIJING (Dow Jones)--A top executive of Calcol Inc. (CLCL-OTC) said Friday the<br>
Cleveland, Ohio-based investment firm has bought out its local joint venture<br>
partner to become the first foreign firm to 100% own its soft drink<br>
manufacturing business in China.<br>
  Calcol has acquired the 20% stake of its local partner China National Food<br>
Industry Corp. in their Beijing-based joint venture concentrate<br>
manufacturing and bottling plant, Calcol Chairman Norman Kaplan said.<br>
  Kaplan declined to reveal the cost of acquiring the 20% stake in Sanhe Meile<br>
Soft Drinks Co., but said the buyout allows the company the opportunity to<br>
boost its soft drink production in China.<br>
  &quot;In the coming year we should be selling pretty widely in Beijing and we are<br>
going to expand pretty rapidly after the WOFE (wholly owned foreign<br>
enterprise) conversion is completed,&quot; he told Dow Jones Newswires in an<br>
interview.<br>
  Kaplan expects a second bottling plant in Shenzhen across the border from<br>
Hong Kong to be opened before the end of 2004, and a third plant in Shanghai<br>
will follow in early 2005.<br>
  &quot;We don't want to stretch ourselves too thin,&quot; Kaplan said. &quot;So we are<br>
concentrating on the three major cities.&quot;<br>
  All three plants will source their concentrate from Beijing which can supply<br>
enough syrup each year to make 2 billion liters of soft drink, he said.<br>
  The addition of two new bottling plants in Shanghai and Shenzhen will also<br>
allow Malibu brands to be sold in the fast-growing Yangtze and Pearl River<br>
deltas, two of the booming regions of China.<br>
  Kaplan expects both plants to be up and running within 18 months, bringing<br>
Sanhe Meihe's total soft drink production up to 25 million cases a year.<br>
 <br>
   Nationwide Mkt For Malibu<br>
 <br>
  Kaplan, who is also chairman of Sanhe Meile Soft Drinks, said the decision<br>
to enter into a joint venture with the state-owned China National Food<br>
Industry Corp. reflected the foreign investment laws at the time the<br>
agreement was concluded in 1995.<br>
  Those laws required a minority local ownership in beverage manufacturing<br>
plants in China.<br>
  But Kaplan said those investment laws have since been relaxed, allowing<br>
foreign companies to own a 100% of a local soft drink business.<br>
  &quot;To my knowledge the other soft drink companies are still joint ventures,&quot;<br>
Kaplan said. &quot;And I think almost all of them (the joint ventures) have some<br>
component of government ownership.&quot;<br>
  Sanhe Meile currently makes Malibu brand soft drinks almost exclusively for<br>
the Beijing market.<br>
  But its expansion plans will allow Malibu to take on global names such as<br>
Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Pepsico Inc.'s (PEP) Pepsi Cola, as well as local<br>
players such as Future Cola made by Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. as an almost<br>
nationally available brand.<br>
  But even with three bottling plants in China, the company's spending plans<br>
are still pretty much small beer compared with the billion-dollar<br>
investments by the global giants.<br>
 <br>
   Rivals Pour In Billions<br>
 <br>
  Coca-Cola has spent $1.1 billion in China since 1979 and expects to invest<br>
an additional $150 million to build six more plants in the next five years<br>
to add to its existing 28 bottling plants.<br>
  PepsiCo has invested $1 billion in China to set up 14 bottling plants and<br>
more than 20 joint ventures across the country.<br>
  While Coca Cola and Pepsi are available throughout most parts of China,<br>
sales of Malibu Cola, Malibu Diet Cola, Malibu Sunrise orange drink and<br>
Malibu Surfs Up lemon-lime drink are limited to Beijing and the surrounding<br>
areas such as Tianjin and Hebei province.<br>
  Cherry cola flavored Malibu Verry Cherry is due to be launched soon.<br>
  About 400 supermarket stores throughout Beijing and the surrounding region<br>
already stock Malibu brand soft drinks, Kaplan said.<br>
  Sanhe Meile's production so far has been limited to 600 milliliter and 1.25<br>
liter bottles.<br>
  The Beijing bottling plant is currently producing 6 million standard cases a<br>
year, Kaplan said.<br>
  The opening this year of a canning line at the Beijing plant will add 7<br>
million cases a year of canned soft drink to the existing bottled capacity,<br>
he said. Shenzhen will also have a canning line to assist shipping the<br>
product across the region to markets in Hong Kong and Macau.<br>
  &quot;We are going to be putting out an awful lot of soda,&quot; Kaplan said.<br>
  Calcol Inc. is a vehicle for foreign investment in China and also has a<br>
stake in a pharmaceutical company in Shenzhen, an industrial city in<br>
southern China near Hong Kong.<br>
  Shares of Calcol Inc. trade on the over-the-counter Bulletin Board in the<br>
U.S.<br>

<br>
By James Kynge in the Financial Times<br>
Published: January 21 2004 4:00 | Last Updated: January 21 2004 4:00 <br>
 <br>
Anyone who doubts that soft drinks are tough business in China should consider the melon cleaver confrontation that erupted in Guangzhou last year. Staff from rival drinks companies chose the same day to put up advertising posters in the same street.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Arguments turned into scuffles. Someone seized a cleaver from a nearby melon seller. Soon three employees of Jianlibao, a mainland company, had been stabbed. But later that day Jianlibao had its revenge; 50 of its staff stormed the offices of its rival, Kangshifu, a Taiwanese company.<br>
<br>
Such is the competitive environment that Norman Kaplan, a US businessman with 23 years' experience in China, finds himself facing. As chairman of Calcol, a small soft-drinks enterprise on the outskirts of Beijing, Mr Kaplan, a former Harvard academic, is taking on market leaders Coca-Cola and Pepsi as well as an array of mainland, Taiwanese and Japanese rivals.<br>
<br>
So far, however, the soundings have been optimistic. In the two years since it began operations, the company has succeeded in placing its products in 400 stores in 10 northern towns and cities. That number should grow to between 1,600 and 2,000 stores by the end of the year, Mr Kaplan says.<br>
<br>
&quot;The people who told me that I could not compete with Coke and Pepsi didn't know what they were talking about,&quot; he adds. Mr Kaplan has invested about $10m in the venture. China's soft drink's market, which doubled in size from 1997 to become worth Rmb117bn ($14.1bn) in 2002, is very sensitive to price.<br>
<br>
&quot;The difference between a nickel and a dime is more significant here than in the US,&quot; says Mr Kaplan, explaining that drinks sold under the company's Malibu brand are generally 20 to 30 per cent cheaper than equivalents sold by Pepsi or Coke.<br>
<br>
Calcol's costs may also be lower. Whereas Coke and Pepsi sell concentrate to their joint-venture bottling plants at a mark-up, Calcol's concentrate is made at the Sanhe Meile bottling plant on the outskirts of Beijing, a 100 per cent subsidiary.<br>
<br>
Coke and Pepsi spend huge sums on marketing, with Pepsi signing basketball star Yao Ming as an advertising icon. Calcol, by contrast, restricts itself to shop promotions in which customers taste the drink free of charge, or are given promotional samples.<br>
<br>
&quot;We only do store promotions, which is also what a little company called Krispy Kreme doughnuts does and they are doing OK,&quot; says Mr Kaplan, who is not above carrying cases of Malibu around to the food and beverage managers at Beijing hotels or to corner shops near his factory.<br>
<br>
Since the acquisition last year of its partner China National Food Industry Corp's 20 per cent stake in Sanhe Meile, raising finance and agreeing a long-term business strategy has become more straightforward. &quot;The joint-venture structure was holding us back,&quot; Mr Kaplan says, framing a complaint familiar among foreign investors.<br>
<br>
Considerable expansion is planned and the extra volume should further reduce costs. Within the next 18 months two bottling plants will be built in Shanghai and Shenzhen to quadruple output to 25m cases and service the booming Yangtse and Pearl deltas.<br>
<br>
So far Malibu appears to be receiving positive reviews from consumers. At Beijing's St Regis Hotel, a regular venue for state banquets, Malibu soft drinks have been served for several months and none of the US and UK diplomatic delegations or Chinese customers that drank it has complained, a manager at the hotel says.<br>
