&quot;Alright so what do we have to do today?&quot;<br>
&quot;Uh, we need, phones, TVs, computers, I'm getting my car customized, and after we pick Rini up from school, we need food at home, and not only that, I need some CDs.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oooh CD's! Yes, we left a bunch at home didn't we?&quot; Andrya smiled. In the real world they were making this kind of talk, but inside they were making slightly different conversation.<br>

It sounded like there was going to be a lot going on today.  Even if he thought some of it was just to cover up something.  He had overheard them while he was coming out of the shower, but it didn't make any difference.<br>
<br>
There was that one problem though.  How was he going to be able to do anything with his powers while they were around.  He was faster, stronger, and smarter than any human.  Not to mention his other powers, which, well... couldn't exactly be explained by good physical training.  He wouldn't think about it now, he would leave it till later.  He didn't like keeping this from Andrya, but for now, he had to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xprettyxxgirl>xprettyxxgirl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/19/03 11:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm41.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Danny's </span><hr size=1> Andrya smiled at Jacob and ordered her food. &quot;So hon, what are you having?&quot; <p>--------<br>

Somehow she always got either caught between or the third wheel when she went out with Andrya. She closed her eyes and thought about both of them. They were both hiding something, she knew what Andrya was hiding, but had no idea what Jacob's was. She thought he was normal because she could read his thoughts but she had a tried a couple more times and she couldn't even get whole words anymore. So she knew he was either not human, or not from around here. She looked at the window that was behind the other two and rubbed her temples at the headache she was getting. Sometimes being a best friend sucked hard. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:verdana;font-size:large;">&quot;In the end is my beginning&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

&quot;No, I knew your sister before she blew up everything, I think that most people have forgotten whatever you might have did on accident, how about when we're done eating we can go to the mall and get you some clothes? What do you say, maybe you can stay with us until we find your sisters again.&quot; Misty smiled at Jennifer and nodded.<br>
