Chapter 5<br>
Slowly but surely<br>
<br>
Week 1:<br>
As I walked around the unfamiliar house, this Michael person was helping me. Rachel, my daughter I think, was looking at me with a frightened look on her face. How I wanted to remember her. I couldn’t. Suddenly Nancy someone that looked familiar to me came over.<br>
“Nila, oh Nila, sweetie.” Nancy said hugging me.<br>
“Do I know you?” I asked looking into the greenish-blue eyes that seemed familiar.<br>
“Yes, I am your best friend, Lock Haven University?” she asked trying to jog my memory that lay in the damaged areas of my mind.<br>
“Nancy,” I said, “Nancy.”<br>
I was trying to commit names that I already knew or somewhat knew to my memory. I sat down on the couch and Rachel sat next to me.<br>
“Do you want or need something Nila?” Michael asked sitting on the other side of me.<br>
“Um no thank you…” I started, “I’m sorry. Who are you?”<br>
“Michael.” He said trying to stifle a cry coming.<br>
“Right, Michael.” I said looking around the sofa and fireplace mantle. Michael stood up and walked with Nancy into the kitchen.<br>
“Michael, I know this is hard on you. But Nila is home you have to stop seeing Lisa.” Nancy said in a hush.<br>
“I know. I have to think.” He said quickly.<br>
“She is luck to be alive.” Nancy said preparing a favorite food of mine. Angel hair pasta with marinara sauce and mushrooms. Michael set the table and told Rachel to wash her hands. I stayed in the living room like a stranger in the shadows. Michael came in to get me.<br>
“Nila it’s time to eat.” He said approaching me with great caution.<br>
“Okay..Michael.” I said hesitantly, I’m not sure I belong in this house.<br>
We ate, but the conversation was a bit dead. No one said anything and I don’t know why. I mean I wish I could unlock what I am lacking but I can’t.<br>
“Um..why don’t I take you to our bedroom.” Michael said helping me up from the table. We walked upstairs, and he opened the door to this beautiful room, blue walls and a king size bed, and a flat bed tv on the ceiling.<br>
“Wow, this is your room?” I asked<br>
“No our room.” He corrected.<br>
“Lots of closet space.” I said wandering into the closet.<br>
Then I noticed something a shoe box with the initials LMP on it. It’s not Nine West of Gucci. It’s clearly marked on the sides and top. I don’t know who this is. But I do intend to find out.<br>
<br>
Week 1: Day 3<br>
“So Nila?” Michael asked watching me swim from the poolside, “Is anything familiar?”<br>
“Well Michael. I will tell you the truth..no.” I said, going under.<br>
Michael’s cell phone rang, he saw that it was Lisa.<br>
“Damn!” Michael said answering the phone, “Look, Nila is home.”<br>
“She aint got nothing to do with us.” She said.<br>
“She has everything to do with it. She is my wife.” Michael said, “I love her.”<br>
“If you love her why are you messing with me?” Lisa asked.<br>
Good question, why is he messing with her. Bets the heck out of me.<br>
“Because I was vulnerable and you were there. You do the math.” Michael said hanging up on her. I surfaced after swimming to the deep end. I grabbed hold of the side wall and pushed off to swim back. Michael came to the shallow side and waited for me. I got out of the pool in my bikini, Michael looked me over several times before handing me a towel. He likes what he sees. I sat down in a lawn chair and basked in the sun. Michael thought to himself, “Damn Girl!” and smacked his lips. I laid there in the chair and thought about some stuff. I closed my eyes and imaged flashed in my mind. I saw a car banged up against a tree, some people huddled over me. I also saw Michael in the hospital and Rachel too.<br>
<br>
Week 1: Day 7<br>
“Nancy, could you help me figure something out here?” I asked looking at the shoe box in the closet.<br>
“Sure what is it?” she said covering me up with the comforter. I had gotten the flu and I was sick.<br>
“Who is LMP?” I asked pointing to the shoe box. Her face suddenly went from colorful to pale white.<br>
“That is Lisa Marie Presley.” Nancy said bring the box over to me.<br>
I took it in my hands and opened it. I saw letters, tons of letters at least 20 or thirty. It seemed like Michael had one for everyday. I looked through them all. Absorbing every word, phrase, every scent of cheap perfume and closed my eyes. I didn’t want Nancy to see that I was hurt. She took the box from me and placed it back where it belonged. I fell asleep about twenty minutes later and felt someone’s hands on me. I was so startled that I screamed.<br>
“Niles it’s me.” Michael said lying down next to me.<br>
“Oh Michael!” I said catching my breath, “You scared me.”<br>
“I’m sorry. Are you okay?” he asked turning on the light.<br>
“I am considering you has an affair with Lisa.” I said looking him in his eyes.<br>
He was speechless for w few minutes, while I was looking in his eyes. I saw my whole life, everything that was missing. What I couldn’t unlock was unlocked. It took the utmost dislike that I had for that girl to bring back floods of memories which I thought were long lost.<br>
“Nila-” he said but I interrupter him.<br>
“Look, Michael I could understand if it were your personal secretary but Lisa?” I said getting out of the bed, “I am going to one of the guest rooms. Don’t follow me.”<br>
“Nila, I’m sorry, I love you. Please don’t leave.” He said holding onto my hand.<br>
“I don’t know, if I love you anymore.” I said leaving wiping me face of fresh warm salty tears.<br>
