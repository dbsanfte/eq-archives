Are you talking about a lesson plan or a training syllabus. A lesson plan is an organized outline for a SINGLE instructional period(like Roll Casting or Hauls). A training syllabus is a step-by-step, building block progression of learning with provisions for regular review and evaluations at prescribed stages of learning. As CCI's you all should have a syllabus to take students from the introduction to fly casting level to an advanced level. Within this syllabus you would have many lesson plans to meet the objectives of each period of instruction. And you should have a supporting Instructor's Guide for your presentation of each lesson. Any CCI should be able to pick up your lesson plan, prepare himself and his instructor's guide from the plan and teach the lesson and it should cover all of the same elements no matter who the instructor is! I will help more with this if you all like. Mike<br>

<br>
A lesson plan will organize and outline a logical order of goals and objectives and establish a chronological schedule to anchor your program. Without one you may risk the possibility of skipping over material inadvertently. <br>
<br>
Due to the reality that unforeseen circumstances can and will arise you should be prepared to improvise, overcome and adapt.<br>
<br>
Due to a variety of variables such as time available, number of students, size of staff and material to be covered a lesson plan should be assembled from modules which can be, included or omitted  in an order of priority to suit the situation.<br>
<br>
When  designing a lesson plan lay out a plan that will cater to the needs of the students first.  Many instructors might teach the way they want to teach or a way that they feel comfortable with instead of the way the students are most likely to learn.  Approach it from the students  perspective the best that you can.  Consider the possibility that you [the instructor] and the students goals might not be the same and be prepared to adapt to their needs first.<br>
<br>
Design a dynamic schedule.  Keep it flowing so not to spend to much time in one place to long on one topic which may lead to boredom.  Incorporate breaks, Involve the students, Always cover material in a sequential order. An example would be to cover the description of the equipment before covering how to use it.  Keep it interesting and fun.  <br>
<br>
Preparation&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An advanced notice is great if possible.  It gives you more time to prepare. Draft your written outline, prepare the equipment, staff, etc., schedule the venue, review [rehearse]  the material to be covered.  Is it clear, concise, can it be improved?&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Time Available&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Prioritize to suit… Lots of time can permit detailed coverage of lots of subjects …little time may mean covering only the basics.  The modular approach is your means to adapt.  <br>
<br>
Goals and objectives&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp     What do we want to accomplish with the time and resources available?  Theme of the class/workshop?  Beginner…Intermediate...advanced?  Basic fly Fishing… Just Casting?  The client is the boss, what do they want or expect?<br>
<br>
Number of students&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This will dictate the amount of staff needed,  How to structure the class, the choice of pairing students up, dividing them into groups, etc. A station to station format perhaps?  Maybe it should be divided into groups of different skill levels if the individuals have been assessed to determine this?<br>
<br>
Staff &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If possible keep the student to staff ratio as small as possible. It’s good practice to keep the head instructor free to range about to oversee and put out fires. Make sure that the entire staff is working from a common denominator as not to create confusion to the students.  Chose staff that share a good sense of chemistry together.   <br>
<br>
Identify special needs      Cater to the special needs of the students….Adapt to suit. Consider the venue, equipment, approach to method of teaching to special needs that you may have identified. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For example don’t waste time going over technical physics to a group of pre-teens.  Don’t be to elementary to an advanced student who is throwing 100ft casts and wants you to get him or her to 105ft.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You would not share the same color of dialog and disposition to a group of young girls. that you would with a group of Marines either.<br>
<br>
Venue&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Indoor /   For the classroom period secure a large enough for the size of the class that’s free of distractions?  Lighting OK?  Are restrooms handy? If not ,what is the contingency? <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Outdoor /  Is there enough room for the students to spread out to cast?  Consider a suitable background to see the lines.  How about the ground surface?… grass cut?  What about wet muddy spots?  Obstacles, pedestrians, foliage?  Consider wind direction.    Water to teach / demo Roll Casting?  Current flow to exhibit the effects of drag and line control.  Is there an area with a smooth surface  to slide cast the line for illustration and trouble shooting ? Basketball / tennis courts / parking lot?  If inclement weather, what is a suitable backup location? &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Equipment &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Consider the equipment to cover your staff and students in case they don’t already have their own.  Make sure the equipment is well suited to the students and consider any special needs.  For example a smaller person with small hands would be at a disadvantage if paired with a heavy saltwater rig.  Consider a fly line color to contrast the background, especially for the instructors.  Have some bright yarn for sight flies.  If the class is also covering fishing, entomology, tying, etc. consider the equipment needed.<br>
<br>
Teaching aides and props&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Have a medium to draw and illustrate with, dry erase board, sketch pad, etc.  A Fly-O  or equivalent can be a great aid if indoors.  I like to have a spinning rod to compare the similarities and differences between the two. Frisbee, paint brushes, etc. Establish straight lines w / rope, old fly lines, mow lines. Have targets to cast to.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Literature and handouts&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Have enough for everyone.  Encourage them to take notes and have the writing paper and pens handy.  Consider a list of recommended books, websites, and video to suggest.  Make sure you give the students a means of contacting you if they have a future question or need a follow up lesson.    <br>
<br>
Audio / Visual equipment &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If your program requires any, make sure it is serviceable in advance. Screen, Have extra bulbs and enough cords to reach the outlets.  Make sure the venue has outlets. If using projection equipment, address the fact that you need to dim the classroom.  Check your slides in advance, VCR, Power point,  For casting troubleshooting it’s hard to beat video recording equipment.<br>
<br>
Food and Refreshments&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Consider this issue,   What is expected, supplying lunch, maybe just drinks? Catered?  If so plan ahead and have a well planned  system.  Again here consider any special needs or requests? Vegetarians? Nothing worse than a mistake here when noon has arrived, people are hungry and no food when it’s expected. At minimum have some cold water available.  Donuts and coffee is a nice touch as people arrive.<br>
<br>
Safety  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Make sure that you alert the class the dangers of a speeding fly line an rod tip. Tell them to provide eye protection or provide it for them.  When casting have them safely spread out from one another. Have contingencies such as where is the closest hospital?  Do you have a first aid kit on sight?  C.P.R. certification?  Etc.<br>
<br>
Schedule / timeline&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sequential order of the material to be covered. This is the heart of your lesson plan and should be purpose built to prioritize the content that will be covered. The best approach is to have your content assembled from modules that will maximize the time allotted and student / staff ratio.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Be on site in advance to set up and brief the staff. <br>
 <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before the class starts as folks are arriving I like to socialize as much as possible to break the ice and establish a friendly atmosphere. <br>
<br>
Introduction of the staff and a brief description of the goals and objections and the material to be covered.<br>
Ask the students to introduce themselves and talk about their background. Things like, how long have they fished, what type of fishing, what species, environments, Is there any special issue that they would like be covered.  When you do this the students immediately become participants, communication is established, and valuable information that can help the instructor to assess the students and fine tune the plan.<br>
<br>
Discuss what Fly Fishing is &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and relate the similarities and differences to other types of angling. [Use a spin rig and then fly rig] If there are complete novices explain to them where this class might take lead to in the future.  Radiate enthusiasm, make them feel like this was a great idea enrolling in this class.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some examples &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp [If just a class on Basic Fly Casting…..]<br>
<br>
Equipment \ tackle …make it brief but cover the essentials. The details on this stuff will be covered by the pro shop at purchase so don’t consume to much time unless questions are asked.  Explain this to them.  <br>
<br>
Basic casting demo, explain what makes the cast work and layout the essentials that can provide them to make it work.  Getting them to be able to form and control a loop is the most important goal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The fly cast is nothing more than the line obeying the path or the rod tip…&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp [Tension…Acceleration…. Stop … Essentials for every cast. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Explain that the reason that it’s not easy at first is muscle memory. And make them prove it to themselves by writing their name with their no dominant hand.<br>
<br>
Smooth surface casting demo &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Slide casting …..and put students on it if available.<br>
<br>
[Short ] Student Casting time&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   Just simple loop control w/30ft secured to the reel.    <br>
<br>
Break……………. <br>
<br>
<br>
Resume<br>
Explain Variables Demo…Length of stroke ….length of pause]  with lines untied from reels. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Substance vs. Style,  teach them to recognize the difference any why it’s important to &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp know. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Stances, grips, rod planes…etc<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Types of casts.. Pick-up and lay down modules, false cast mod., Roll cast mod. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Offhand, etc.<br>
<br>
Main Student casting time&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Form your class /instructor structure. [Coach time] Monitor  and adjust the time spent to the circumstances at hand. Be sure to address any special problems or topics that were promised.   Make sure they get self discovery time. <br>
Knots &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  [If on schedule] basic ones to give them a chance to fish.  From tippet to tippet to fly at least.<br>
<br>
Flies and entomology&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ???    [If on schedule]  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Lunch   <br>
<br>
Other Modules&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      [If scheduled] Such as, Striking.. playing…releasing… Fish habitat and needs…Feeding modes.. Rise forms.. Fly selection…Reading water…Etiquette&amp; stewardship. Etc.<br>
<br>
Break<br>
<br>
On Stream Application&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp [If scheduled]  Wading techniques and safety…explain drag and the methods used to combat it…Presentation casts…Mends… Nymphing / Wets / subsurface…Dry fly…etc.<br>
<br>
Conclusion&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Conclude the program by making sure each student knows that you enjoyed their participation and you would be more than happy to spend additional time. [If in fact you are free to do so.]<br>
<br>
Staff Debriefing&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After the equipment is stowed and the venue is secured you and the staff should discuss the performance of the class.  Can it be improved?   Convey your appreciation for their help.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope this will help you as to serve as a checklist when drafting plans for one of your teaching endeavors.  Special thanks to Floyd Franke, Bruce Richards, Chuck Easterling, and John Wilson for their insight.<br>

Many graduates of the CCI Program think that they have reached the finale. In actuality they have just begun their time as instructors and should grow in their knowledge and abilities to present material and effect changes in students(CCI to Master). Your time spent in the preparation of the above post &quot;Lesson Plan Considerations&quot; shows that you are challenging yourself to be a better and more informed instructor wanting to deliver quailty instrution. I hope that you will consider my MOI Course book as you touch on a few of the topics covered therein but not in their entirety. For everones benefit(CCI's) I will list one form of a lesson plan format that lends itself well to use in fly casting instruction. <br>
Lesson: Name of the lesson<br>
Objective:<br>
Elements:<br>
Schedule:<br>
Equipment:<br>
Instructor Actions:<br>
Student Actions:<br>
Completion: Here list the standards that insure your Objective was met!!!!!<br>
      Now, looking back at your &quot;Considerations&quot; I note that you touch on items from the teaching process and the learning process from the MOI Course but only minutely, again I suggest you absorb the MOI Course. A few constructive comments, be careful in trying to figure out what your students want in forming a lesson, KNOW what their goals are, plan &amp; teach the correct lesson! Also, you should incorporate a review(part of step 4 of the teaching process) before the end of your presentation. Also, an evaluation(the other part of step 4 of the teaching process)that requires the students to demonstrate how well the lesson objectives have been met. This is a great time to praise the students for their progress and show them that they are progressing towards their goal/s. This evaluation does not have to be formal, it can be done by the instructor/staff as the lesson progresses but the students should be made aware of progress!!!!! Again, Jeffery, you show great diligence towards gaining the skills of an advanced, dedicated, caring instructor. My compliments to you for your efforts. Let me know if you want the MOI Course, ask John if he recommends it for you. Mike<br>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thanks for the compliment.  My intention here was to  outline some sort of a checklist to  fall back on, nothing more. This past year when Floyd Franke asked me to give a class on setting up casting classes at the annual “FFF Instructors Rendezvous”   he was knowingly putting me in a position to address one of my weaker skills.  That would be organizational skills.  Working for years in the construction industry I have  prided  myself on my improvisational skills and have relied on working from my head instead of working from a piece of paper.  So that said, I’m glad I put it together.  Now keep in mind  my list is only things to consider.  I never intended  to try to make it entire or complete.  It is based on  the success and experience I have had heading schools  I do with “International Angler” here in Pennsylvania. And also much appreciated input and advice given from some of my mentors such as Chuck Thompson, Floyd Franke, Bruce Richards, Chuck Easterling, and John Wilson.  Before I started I asked for their input.  It was actually interesting and quite surprising to me the contrast between different instructors and how different their approaches are to each other.   This just reinforced my belief in style vs. substance even further. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now responding to your observations of  my list, you are correct .  I just scratched the surface.  That was the intention and nothing more.  I would probably benefit much from your course book. As a matter of fact email me  and we’ll exchange mailing addresses so I can get my hands on a copy.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your quote” [ be careful in trying to figure out what your students want in forming a lesson, KNOW what their goals are, plan &amp; teach the correct lesson!  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Expand upon this in more detail so I can go back and see where I might of  overlooked this.  I thought I covered that.  I adapt the lesson based on  the goal and $$$ of the paying customer.  Explain this more.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And  I should of mentioned that I do give out positive reinforcement to the students throughout the entire period of the class and  I am glad you  found that I in fact did overlook including this in the list.  I shall edit it in, thank you.<br>
<br>
More comments and opinions are welcome from anyone  and appreciated.<br>

Understand their desires and goals but teach from a syllabus of lesson plans that you have developed or draw from them in constructing a new lesson. I learned this from students that tell me they only want me to teach them to double haul, and they are emphatic about it! Well, they show up and do not possess a proper Basic Casting Stroke, so there is no way to &quot;Only&quot; teach them how to haul. Just because they pay a fee does not entitle them to tell us what to teach them. We have to be professional and tactful at times. You did cover this well and my comment was for others reading your post, not so much for you alone. My e-mail is miamivise@earthlink.net Use MOI as the subject and I will open it from my spam blocker file. Give me a postal address and I can get it out tomorrow, it will come to you priority mail, you will have it in 2 to 3 days, costs is $20 total, you can mail a check after you receive it. Oh, the MOI course is offered to my students that complete the CCI course that I run. Both John, myself and others feel that the FFF program places &quot;Certified&quot; instructors in the field needing more knowledge of &quot;Methods Of Instruction(MOI)&quot; knowledge and skills. You will be schooled on The Learning Process, The Teaching Process &amp; Effective Communication Techniques as they specifically apply to fly casting instruction.

I humbly offer a few things I have learned over the years. It maybe that you did not think them     important or just over looked them.<br>
<br>
 First I place my left-handed caster on the left.<br>
  Second after a while with the rod in their hands I have them lay the rod down and ‘Listen’. I have found that the young ones can not hear with a rod in their hands and the older ones need a break.<br>
Give a short talk on some point and then go back at casting again.<br>
<br>
 For muscle memory I use “pantomime” this is a great tool.<br>
<br>
I try to keep the class light and FUN this is what I am selling, is Fun. Not Work.<br>
<br>
When I have a large group of casters and several coaches, I will have the coaches meet with me to the side and let them know what I am going over next so to be all teaching the same thing on the same page. It gives the coach a chance to ask a question or point out a student that is having a problem.<br>
<br>
You did not say that you mark your lines of your teaching outfits. I have mine marked at 20, 30 and 50 ft. this way it saves time I just say place the 2 marks on the rod or the three at the tip.<br>
<br>
I do have a question.<br>
 How do you set up a Video Camera to get the best angle on the cast? Hand / arm / Loop?<br>
 Do you have a TV that you can set up for the VCR? Class room? Outside? <br>

 Introduce, Involve, Review<br>
 This gives the student the subject 3 times.<br>
<br>
 I try not to use Acronyms at first like &quot;SLP&quot; I will use all the words. <br>
Until the very end in the review. Then I will introduce the shorten stance.<br>
 &quot;Straight line path of the rod tip or SLP&quot; this insures that we are <br>
communicating the right words during the teaching part of the lesson.<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thanks for your input. Great advice.  I have used some of  the methods  that you  have suggested from time to time and many others.  I had no intentions to mention them all in this list though.  This list is intended to be more generic.  I haven’t marked the lines as you suggested, but would agree that doing so is a good idea.  What I have been doing is making a judgment call based on the individual student’s ability and secured what ever length line to the reel by a few wraps around the base of the reel.  I may also not do this.  It just depends on  the situation.  If I do mark the lines as you suggest , and I will…. I will probably only mark the end of the belly. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp About the camera,  The times I’ve used the camcorder it has only been outside during private lessons.  I haven’t worked out the logistics for using it with a group yet.  So I don’t feel like I’m qualified to answer to much about it.  As a matter of fact I don’t even own the camera.  I borrow it from my brother in law.  As far as shooting angles,  I don’t worry about recording the loop.  This is something that the student can see w/o any equipment.  It’s the student’s anatomical motions that I’m trying to capture.  I will shoot from whatever angle it takes to get what ever element I’m trying to record.  The view finder provided on the camera itself has been  adequate  for my purposes so far.  From the experience I have had so far w/ video diagnostics  so far I think it can be a powerful tool.  Hopefully Santa will bring me my own Digital unit w/all the bells and whistles, but somehow I know I’ll get a lump of coal instead.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just before I added this reply I refreshed the screen and read your last post.  I will be careful not to use any acronyms before they are understood as you have suggested.  Great advice. Thanks. <br>

The material in the Class/Course is taken from books &amp; texts that are written by Educational Experts for training and developing skills in persons wishing to learn how to teach professionally. I have been using these materials and training people to be Instructors for 30+ years. I adapted the text, ideas and principles to be fly casting instructor specific. The materials are not my concepts or something that I have made up but rather something developed by educators for educators! To maintain my 3 Federal Instructor Certificates I am required to renew them every 1 to 2 years by sitting in refresher classes/workshops for 16 to 24 and discussing the materials in the MOI, writing Curriculums, Syllabus, Lesson Plans, instructor guides and other training materials. I feel that the FFF CCI program needs to be strengthened in the Instructional capabilities area. The following is a topical outline from the MOI. 1. The Learning Process, Definition, Characteristics, Laws, How  People Learn, Levels, Skills, Forgetting and retention, Retention, Transfer, Habit Formation, 2. Effective Communication, Basic elements, Barriers, 3. the Teaching Process, Teaching Methods, and the Lesson Plan, format, partial samples and a completed sample. <br>
 There is still much misuse of terms posted here as to a lesson plan. I feel all CCI's can further benefit from knowing and practicing the teaching principles in the MOI Course. So far only John Wilson has accepted the material in the proper frame of mind to become a Professional Instructor, Flysoup says it is not what he needed. All CCI's need to understand these teaching principles and employ them to be truly Professional Instructors. Please, one and all, let me know if I can help, sincerely, Mike <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=58.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=58.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.threadControl?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm5">Help Files<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm6">Archives<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm8">White River<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm9">Taneycomo<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm10">Little Red<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm11">Norfork<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm12">Places of Interest<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13">Casting Corner<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14">General Discussions<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm17">The Environment<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm18">Fly Tying and Entomology</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri>Fly Fishing Arkansas and Missouri</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13>Casting Corner</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><a href="http://www.flyfishingarkansas.com">Fly Fishing Arkansas</a><font color=#000000> - </font><br><br> <a href="http://www.flyfishingarkansas.com">BACK TO FLY FISHING ARKANSAS HOME PAGE</a>
