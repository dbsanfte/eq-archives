Then a soft sigh escaped Jayden's lips as his hands brushed along her heated skin following the garment, lifting her, unresisting, up to her knees and turning her to face him, his eyes travelling up her body like a caress.<br>
<br>
Their eyes met and held for a long moment before he pulled her against him. Jayden's back arched, trying to get even closer as her breasts pressed against his smooth chest, the rosy peaks hardening against his cool skin.<br>
<br>
As he lowered his head the words whispered through her brain <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I can not deny myself...&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> causing her pulse to throb through her. Her lips parted as his slid over them allowing him to deepen the kiss and her fingertips traced a path up along his back to wrap around him, one hand tangling in the hair at the back of his head. <br>

She did not pull away, instead deepend the kiss with him which told him anything that followed would not be resisted. He pulled her closer, one arm around the small of her slender back as the other traveled up through her thick red hair. Zack could feel her heart beat through her lush firming breasts that were pressed against him and it sent a thrill through him.<br>
<br>
The scent of her warm rich blood teased his senses as he continued to kiss her but Zack denied himself a bite. He could wait to taste her sweet flavour and contented himself with tasting her lips instead. His pants dropped to the floor when he undid them, freeing his swelling length to press against her lower stomach. Gently with her still pressed against him, Zack lifted her off her knees and backwards onto the bed as he climbed aboard for standing was growing tiresome. Softly he laid her down on the pillows, never breaking the passionate kisses as his hand that was behind her back now moved down her right flank. The vampire settled himself between her legs as he broke off the kiss to gaze into her eyes, his hand now arousingly caressing her right breast.<br>
<br>
There seemed to be no confusion in her eyes as he gazed deeply into them before giving in to his desires to kiss her again. This time however it was not as long of a kiss as before because this time he decided to familerize himself with her body instead. With exploring hands and lips, he moved down between her legs, caressing and kissing her lushious mounds and smooth stomach. His tongue teased the tips of her hardened nipples before he smiled at her and continued on.<br>
<br>
The destination of his attention became clear as he lifted and parted her legs with his hands, his eyes and breath bathing over the beauty between. Teasingly he planted a soft kiss ever so lightly while placing pressure upon her opening with his index finger. Soon the pressure increased as he placed his lips fully upon her,his finger entered her moist depths and explored slowly in and out. Zack's ears listened for her reactions, his lips and hands waiting to feel her reaction as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/11/03 6:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Jayden could feel Zack's hand snake through her hair and let her head relax back against it, never breaking the contact of their lips. She felt his hard length pushing along her stomach and a small moan escaped her mouth, as she rubbed against it, more aroused by the proof that she was doing the same thing to him that he was doing to her. <br>
<br>
Feeling herself being lifted backwards, Jayden relaxed in his arms, trusting that he wouldn't let her fall. In the short time she had known him, there seemed to be some connection  ...something in her mind that knew she could give herself over to him without being hurt. something that made her trust him. As he nestled her in the pillows, he broke the kiss and looked deeply into her eyes as his hands began to roam over her sensitive skin and down to tease her breast.<br>
<br>
Jayden gave Zack a smile and melted into him as he bent down to kiss her again. Not content for long Zack moved down her body, eliciting soft moans as he explored her with his hands and mouth. She lay bonelessly as she felt him parting her legs, and her breath became ragged as he reached his final destination and began to tease her with his tongue. Jayden's hands fisted in the sheets and her moans increased as the pleasure from what he was doing began to spirial through her, as she came closer and closer to the edge of her release. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/12/03 5:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> His eyes watched her move, taking in the sight of her chest rising and falling, the sight of her fists clutching at the sheets. Her moans became like sweet music to his ears, her ragged breath a sign to him that what he was doing pleased her greatly. Zack was pleased with himself, he enjoyed doing this to her and witnessing the effects. He wanted to bring her right to that edge on the brink of falling over and keep her there for a few moments before making sure she was washed right over into an abyss of pleasure.<br>
<br>
Zack's tongue flicked against her moist skin as his fingers became damp between her walls. For some reason he had not expected this to come about so soon, but some how everything with him and Jayden fit together so perfectly. It was almost like they were both the lost pieces to eachother's puzzle of life and now carefully set in place, they created the most beautiful perfect of pictures.<br>
<br>
Having satisfied his thurst betweem her legs, Zack slowly lifted away to move over top of her closely yet again. As he moved forward he dragged his length teasingly up the inside of her leg, his lips seeking hers once more. His strong arms bent at the elbows as he settled his body against hers, pinning her down firmly while he lay between her legs. The moment seemed to stop as he kissed her deeply, posed with his length against her moist womanhood. The time for foreplay had passed and the desires to take her now without hesitation took control and with one smooth movement he lowered himself into her. The motion of his body caused his manhood to nose into her completely in one deep thrust before he began to slowly move in and out of her, kissing her all the while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/13/03 1:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=25>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Through the haze of pleasure, Jayden felt Zack moving slowly back up her body. It seemed to take an agonizingly long time before his lips were once again sliding over hers. As he thrust into her, Jayden sighed into his mouth as they kissed. <br>
<br>
Wrapping her legs around the man above her, she began to move with him in a most intimate dance. Her fingertips traced paths of their own along his back and she sighed his name. Arching her head back on the pillow, the ivory expanse of her throat laid bare to his questing lips, she wimpered as her climax began to take over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/13/03 12:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> They moved together, their bodies becoming as one as the scent of their passion filled the room. Zack heard his name called over and over in her breath as he quickened his powerful thrusts for there was nothing he wanted to hear more then her cry out in her release. The way she felt against him, those whimpers from such delicate lips all stirred something deep inside the heart of the vampire, a feeling he had not felt in a while. Maybe it was helped along by the fact they got along so well so quickly but Zack was beginning to think this was something special in developement.<br>
<br>
His hips rocked down harder, forcing himself deeper into her wet womanhood as he felt her hands trace over his back. So wonderful was her touch that he shuddered with excitement but due to his stamina, no climax could be reached yet. Being a vampire had many gifts and prolonged climaxes were one of them. His lips moistened her smooth arched neck as he kissed and sucked softly on it, his fangs pricking her skin but never peircing. He had no desire to feed from her yet, no that would be the icing on the cake.<br>
<br>
Slowly he sat up, pulling away from her as he did so. His hands taking her firmly and turning her to the side. Gently he raised her right leg as she lay on her left side and knelt over her left leg as the head of his length nosed into her. Zack teased her by thrusting his nine inches into her and then pulling out before thrusting in deeply again, his right arm hooking her right leg at his elbow. Smoothly he bent over her, now thrusting quickly into her as she lay on her side, his right hand caressing her breasts while his lips kissed the side of her neck. The vampire kept her hips on her side with her right leg raised and bent so he could take her body with ease and power but he allowed her upper body to shift partly onto her back. In this position she could arch her back, their bodies still in full contact and his lips once more sought hers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/13/03 7:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=27>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Jayden groaned in dissapointment as Zack sat up and abruptly pulled away, but in seconds she realized he wasn't leaving her. As he repositioned her, she let him move her to her side, and as he slid back into her, her eyes drifted shut and she bit down on her lower lip.<br>
<br>
The exquisite pleasure was almost too much as it bordered on the edge of pain and she moaned, arching up, feeling his hands and lips teasing her. Their bodies met and skin slid against skin sensually once more as they writhed on the cool sheets.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A> at: 9/13/03 7:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/13/03 8:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Zack groaned deeply into the skin of her neck as he thrust deep into her womanhood. Her earlier orgasm and now her moans told tale to him that she was enjoying this as much as he was. However he knew she was still weak from her earlier times before meeting him so he would have to take it easy on her. He did not want to make her feel pain by making love to her longer then she could stand even if he could go on so he decided to finish with his own first orgasm.<br>
<br>
Usually and with either other vampire girls, Zack would go a few orgasms before deciding he had gone long enough but with Jayden this was different. He could very well be the first vampire she had made love to and vampires made different lovers then mortals did. But he would explain that all to her later as he continued to kiss her deeply, bordering on lovingly as his length pumped into her furiously.<br>
<br>
His body began to tremble, his length inside her swelling and throbbing as his release neared. Zack's breath bathed her skin as he gazed down at her when he sat up to position himself to thrust deeper and harder. His hands continued to explore her breasts as he lifted her leg higher to allow himself to come closer. The feeling of his orgasm rushed through him from between his legs to the tip of his length as he stayed inside of her as long as he could. With a groan of pleasure that could only echo what he really felt inside, Zack pulled out of her, her moisture dripping from his length as it trembled against the inside of her left leg. The cool gel oozed from his throbbing length onto her leg as he came, his form settling down against her so he could kiss her lips.<br>
<br>
By now the urge for blood and the actual need for it coursed through the vampire's veins as he crawled off her to lie beside, partly probbed up against the back of the couch. Gently he pulled her so she lay beside him at the waist on his left side but her back arched in a comfortable position over his chest with her head resting against his right shoulder. His hand brushed her hair back from her eyes and neck as he pressed his lips to hers. There was just something about Jayden, something he respected so much that he could not bite her without her permission. With his right hand caressing her breasts, his left caressing her cheek, he began to whisper softly to her.<br>
<br>

<br>
Jayden took in deep breaths of air trying to calm her still racing heart as Zack settled back behind her. From her relaxed position she heard him begin to whisper to her. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I would request a small amount of your blood which is not mine to take unless you consent.

She was torn, as a small prickling of fear ran along her nerve endings. He wanted to bite her....but then he promised no pain and he had been so gentle tonight. Turning her head on his chest so that she could look up at him, and wetting her lips with the tip of her tongue, she asked in a soft voice, &quot;You're sure it won't hurt?&quot; She knew he could have hurt or done much worse to her tonight, and so even though it frightened her,she gave her answer, trembling slightly, &quot;Ok, you can have some of my blood.&quot; <br>

He knew he would be lying if he said it would not hurt at all for the first prick always did. But the pleasure that came afterwards would wash that whole memory into the distance but Zack did not want to harm her in any way. She was like a beautiful and fragile flower lying there naked and wet with sweat from their passion, her very soul handed over to him in the most vulnerable way. There was simply no desire within him to hurt her.<br>
<br>
&quot;It will not be painful my sweet love... It will take you to a place of emotions you have never experienced before.&quot; His voice was calm and soothing, his right hand caressing her breast still while his left turned her cheek to the side to expose her neck for his white fangs. &quot;There is nothing to be frightened of, I will never hurt you.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that he sank his fangs into her silky moist skin, sending a quick shiver of pain through her. But that pain was gone just as quickly as he began to feed from her rich blood that flowed, the pleasure of the act coursing through out his body and bringing a ridged life back into his manhood. Normally Zack would make love to a girl and feed at the same time but with Jayden it was different, he had to be careful because she was so weak. Slowly he drank and not to deeply so as to prolong a feeling that would triple that of any orgasm and cause multiple ones between her legs. He took great care not to tear her skin with his sharp fangs and not a drop of blood escaped his lips.<br>
<br>
Finally with a growl and almost gasp for air, he removed his fangs from her neck and licked the wound closed before making sure he had no blood upon his lips. It was then that he craddled her in his arms and gazed deeply in her eyes to make sure she was alright. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/14/03 4:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=31>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Jayden listened to Zack's softly spoken words, reassuring her that he would never want to hurt her, then let him turn her head so he could access her neck. As he bit down, she gasped as the pain pierced through her, only to be replaced seconds later by an exquisite, sensual feeling that coursed through her body, sending her crashing into another orgasm. She lost track of how long he fed from her, surrounded by waves of pleasure again.<br>
<br>
As he pulled away, licking her neck breifly, Jayden was almost dissapointed by the loss. But soon she felt him cuddling her close, and her eyes which had drifted shut, fluttered open to see him gazing at her intently.<br>
<br>
&quot;I never knew it would be like that..is it always?&quot; she said giving him an almost shy smile, &quot;I mean your the first Vampire I've ever....met,&quot; she finished a blush starting to creep across her cheeks.

<br>
&quot;Now if you'll allow me to regretably slip out from our loving embrace, I will go make you some breakfast. Zack continued as he climbed back into his pants. &quot;I do not know what you wish to eat but I can make pancakes... french toast, I have cereal... milk... more sex?&quot; he charmed her with another smile before turning his back to her and heading into the dark kitchen.<br>
<br>
The kitchen lit up as he turned on the lights, his figure visible to her from behind the counter for the kitchen, livingroom and gym were all connected with low walls or none at all. He knew he could make just about what ever she wished to eat and as he looked over at her fondly, he wanted her at full strength. The sight of her tore through him with longing for more of her. Making love to her had ended all to quickly but he knew he had to stop, she was not strong enough yet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just ask me what you want... then maybe take a shower if you like while I make it?

She watched as he handed her the robe and her eyes followed his movements as he slipped from the bed and retreived his own clothes. Then shifted, watching as he moved through the dark room and turned the kitchen light on. Nobody in a long time had been so sweet to her.<br>
<br>
Jayden sat in the middle the bed amid the rumpled sheets, holding the robe just high enough to entice one's eyes as they travelled over her bare skin. Her hair fell desheveled around her shoulders leaving no doubt to what she'd been doing for the last hour. As their eyes met across the distance she heard him say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Just ask me what you want... then maybe take a shower if you like while I make it? I think we both made a little mess...&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
A questioning look entered her eyes as she replied, &quot;You really are going to cook for me?&quot; She paused to give him a big smile, &quot;Then I'll let you decide...it all sounds delicious.&quot; She pulled on the robe and crawled to the edge of the bed. &quot;A shower sounds good too,&quot; she added as she stood, swaying for a moment. &quot;But I don't think it'll need to be a cold shower...now.&quot; Jayden gave Zack a sexy smile as she looked up at him through her hair, then turned towards the bathroom.<br>
<br>
Closing the door behind her Jayden moved over to the mirror and looked curiously at her neck. The marks she could see were those cause by their lovemaking, but nothing from his bite. Her eyes travelled up taking in the slightly puffy lips, skipping over the bruise on her cheek, a reminder she didn't need, she stopped looking into her own eyes. A look of satasifaction reflected back hiding the troubled thoughts that started to pop into her head. 'God Jay, what have you done? Sleeping with a man....vampire, that you've only known a day. He has a life that your not a part of...what happens when he wants to go back to that. What happens to you then?&quot; She turned, angry with herself for letting those thougts ruin the happiness she'd felt moments ago.<br>
<br>
Turning on the shower, she stepped under the spray allowing it to beat down on her, trying to wash away her doubts. 'Enjoy what he's given you,' she told herself as a tear slipped down her cheek to mingle with the water already there. But she had a feeling that she was going to miss him greatly when she had to leave. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/15/03 10:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Zack watched her until her image was hidden from his eyes by the bathroom door before he turned back into the kitchen. He did not know what she liked for breakfast but he figured most mortals liked the same thing. With a smile as he heard the water turn on in the shower, his imagination delighted himself with images of her lying breathless underneith him. It was rather unusual for him to have such a romantic encounter with a mortal girl so soon but he was seeing something in her he liked a great deal.<br>
<br>
There was something about her that made him comfortable, made him want to be the best he could be for her. Inside his heart stirred emotions that he had thought were forever dead for he had never felt this for a girl before. Something about her told him he wanted to wake up each night for the rest of eternity and see her lying there beside him. Zack began to entertain ideas of siring her which was something he never did and had never done.<br>
<br>
As he thought about the bathing beauty, Zack set about making pancakes for her. Being the vampire that he was, obtaining these ingredients was not a hard thing in this city this destroyed. Soon everything was spooned out of the bowl and onto the large frying pan as Zack began to build a stack of pancakes. As they turned a golden brown he set the table for two and put glasses of orange juice, a bowl of sorted fruits. There was also two bowls of yogert though his was a little bit bigger. Just because he was dead did not mean he fed on blood only.<br>
<br>
Soon everything was done, the table set with the stack of pancakes and a saucer of syrup. The lights that hung above the table were dimmed a little as Zack opened his curtains so the light city could be seen outside the windows. Zack stood for a moment and gazed up at the sky, as though looking for the moon he would never see here again before returning to the couch. Their sex stained sheets were pulled free before he folded in the matress, knowing that in the morning he would invite her into his bedroom if she was comfortable enough.<br>
<br>
Now all that was missing was Jayden's presense and Zack began to wonder how long she was going to be in there. The idea to go in and see was stilled as he knew their food would get really cold if he did. A smirk played across his lips as he waited, forgetting completely that he was still just in his black track pants. He grabbed an apple as an appetizer while he waited, his fangs easily biting off a good chunk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/16/03 3:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> As Jayden stepped out of the shower, wonderful smells invaded her senses. Her mouth began to water, and her stomach protested as she hurriedly grabbed a towel and began to dry off. As soon as she was done she turned to the stack of folded clothes untouched since she'd taken them off the night before and pulled out the lacy pale pink panties and bra. Slipping into them, she picked up the robe deciding to finish dressing after they ate and slid her arms back in, leaving it hang open. <br>
<br>
Looking around the bathroom for a minute, she finally found what she had been searching for, and picking up the brush began to tame her still damp locks. She hoped breifly that Zack wouldn't mind her using it, but smirked, remembering all the intimacies they'd indulged in earlier, and figured he wouldn't. As the brush glided through her hair, she decided to let her doubts go for now and just enjoy his company. In this world no one knew if they'd be alive tomorrow anyway. <br>
<br>
Once done, Jayden pulled the door open and strolled out into the next room. Her eyes swept across the table, and then up Zack's naked chest to see him standing there eating an apple. Casually she moved towards him, stopping at the end of the table. Looking down, she was amazed, and touched at what awaited her. &quot;You did this for me?&quot; she looked at the man with a big smile, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Continuing on around to one side Jayden bent down appreciating the delicous smells. <br>
<br>
Glancing sideways she could see that he was watching her, and an idea formed in her head to get him back for teasing her last night. She reached into the bowl of yogurt letting it cover her forefinger.  Looking up at Zack with an innocent smile, she put the finger in her mouth and began sucking the yogurt off, &quot;Mmmm.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/16/03 6:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> &quot;Of course this is all for you my dear, well not the portion I will eat myself.&quot; Zack smiled as he watched her lick the yogurt off her fingertip sexually. He had to focus his mind into dwelling on something other then a bedroom activity. Her state of dress was not helping much either but the vampire forced himself to focus on something else. There would always be time later for some activities he was really enjoying with her.<br>
<br>
He helped himself to the stack of pancakes, a slice of butter on the top and syrup to pour over it. It was obvious the vampire could develope quite an appetite as he sliced into the stack with his knife and fork and with some modesty proceeded to fill his mouth with it. Zack did manage to eat with his mouth closed but soon his helping vanished with only the orange juice and yogurt left.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now I was thinking of what we could do this evening.&quot; he sipped his juice and settled back in his chair. &quot;I have a few finacial... errands I have to do that you can come along for. The club is closed tonight so there is no need to go there...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh and I wanted to let you know that I would enjoy it if you wished to remain here in my home for a while... Unless you have someplace to go, you may live here... with me.&quot; Zack continued as he helped himself to a spoon full of yogurt. He hoped she would stay for he had so much he wanted to ask her and do with her. &quot;You would never have to worry about being hurt or alone ever again...&quot; his voice became soft as he finished and sat there with his eyes gazing deeply into hers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/17/03 4:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=37>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Jayden sat down and fixed her own plate and then taking a bite, closed her eyes and sighed in enjoyment. After the breif pause she worked her way through the meal, growing full long before she could finish everything. <br>
<br>
She looked over at Zack as he leaned back and began to talk about having to go out and inviting her to come along. Jayden, who could have been happy where she was and would have gladly forgotten all about the world outside right now, set her fork down, &quot;Go out?....Ok,&quot; she agreed slowly, but a worried look entered her eyes and she dropped them back towards the table.<br>
<br>
As doubts began to surface in her mind that maybe he'd had his fun and was taking her out to leave her on the streets again, she was shocked by his next words, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Oh and I wanted to let you know that I would enjoy it if you wished to remain here in my home for a while...

Jayden's eyes flew back up meeting the searching look in his own. She didn't realize she'd been holding her breath and took in a gasp of air, &quot;I-I can stay...here?

Definatly a woman's mind to come up with that question so Zack decided to answer it without actually making it seem like he had read her mind so he shifted in his chair to look around the apartment. &quot;Of course you may stay here, thats why I invited you to. Besides I do not have anyone else here with me in my suite, never have actually for any length of time. I would be very happy if you stayed here Jayden.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It would not interfer with my life either because I am not a vampire that does not mix with humans. To be seen with one, to have one walk by my side would only tell others that you are my familer. No vampire will dare harm you for that would be sealing their fate.&quot; Zack stood up and carried his dishes over into the kitchen and placed them in the sink. &quot;Of course I expect there will be things that I must do as a part of the vampire lifestyle that you may not be comfortable with just yet... such as some of the ways I make money.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly he made his way back to her to stand behind her chair with his hands gently on her shoulders. It was there he leaned down and kissed her cheek softly, then her lips before straightening back up. &quot;I do not attach myself to the slavery and shipment of humans, my business tends to be more professional.

Jayden leaned against the closed bathroom door for a moment, thinking how lucky she was that he had found her instead of some other Vampire. Shaking herself out of her thoughts, she picked up her clothes and hurriedly slipped into the sweater and jeans she'd been wearing last night. Picking up her shoes, she wandered out to the living room and sat down on the couch, a blush stealing across her face as she remembered what they'd been doing earlier. As she bent down to tie her shoes, her hair fell forward to hide the small smile that accompanied the blush. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/18/03 6:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You have already paid me...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Zack thought to himself as he remembered her giving herself freely to him even though it was not her nature. They had a connection that made wanting her to stay seem so right even if it was not normal of him to do. Even Zack had to admit it seemed a little weird to invite her to live with him but he could find no reason not to want her to. Their next physical encounter would be even more exciting and passionate for now he knew she was fully recovered.<br>

A smile crossed his lips when she reappeared from the bathroom, dressed in her only clothes from earlier. It reminded him he had to get her something different to wear since she could not remain in that all the time. He wondered if she had any back were she had come from but he doubted she would want to go back there if she did. Besides if he met that Tommy fellow, blood would flow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Jayden, tonight will be a busy evening for us both, I have decided on stopping at a few extra places tonight, call in a few favors.&quot; he smiled at her as she tied her shoes. &quot;But excuse me a moment, I need to dress for going out.&quot; a laugh escaped his lips as he looked down at his bare chest. He certainly could not go out like this tonight.<br>
<br>
Quickly he made his way into his bedroom were he remained with the door closed for several minutes. The sounds of drawers opening and closing could be heard as he dressed and then all was silent. Soon the bedroom door opened and Zack stepped out wearing a dark blue suit with a silk white tie-less shirt. A gold neckess hung from his neck and a gold watch sparkled from his left wrist, the shoes on his feet were black and shinny. His hair was messed up with gel and he smiled charmingly at her from the doorway. &quot;Ready?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showMessageRange?topicID=4.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showMessageRange?topicID=4.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showMessageRange?topicID=4.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showMessageRange?topicID=4.topic&start=81&stop=91>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showNextMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.emailToFriend?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="kalaberiafrm36">Mortal and Kindred Laws<option value="kalaberiafrm37">Character Biographies<option value="kalaberiafrm38">Character Plotting<option value="kalaberiafrm45">Times Square<option value="kalaberiafrm40">Central Park<option value="kalaberiafrm41">Stanton Isle<option value="kalaberiafrm42">Abandoned Subway<option value="kalaberiafrm43">Chitter Chatter<option value="kalaberiafrm44">Advertisements <option value="kalaberiafrm46">Admin and mods<option value="kalaberiafrm47">Warehouse District</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia>MidnyghtRising</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45>Times Square</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br> <a href=http://www.runesofdesire.com><img src=http://runesofdesire.com/rod6.jpg></a><br><br>
