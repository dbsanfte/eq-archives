I my as well share my innermost thoughts with anyone in the world who feels like reading them right? So.. here goes.<br>
<br>
I've actually been having a really bad, no actually an awful horrible week. My grandma died two days ago which is majorly crushing, I cry just writing about it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cry --><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/godlovers80868/images/mecry.gif ALT=":cry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     The worst part of it all was seeing my grandpa cry, it was so heart-wrenching. Her funeral is on Monday so anyone who reads this pray for my family please. I'm going to change the subject now because I really don't want to start crying all over again. I've been trying so hard not too.<br>
<br>
Now that I've shared my bad news and prolly but you all in a bad mood too, I'll let you in on a little bit about myself. I'm seventeen years old and a junior in high school. I'm the captain of my cheerleading squad. Oh yeah and my name is Ashley too by the way. And for everyone's information cheerleading is NOT easy and the squad is not made up of a bunch of snobby, stuck-up ditzes. I just thought I'd clear up a few of those stereotypes right off the bat. My cheerleading squad is basically a second family; we fight, we hug <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :grouphug --><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/godlovers80868/images/grouphug.gif ALT=":grouphug"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , we trust, we scream in frusturation, etc.... My cousin Mandy is on the squad too and she can definately be my salvation sometimes. There are times when I think I am going to go insane trying to stay in control of those crazy girls, but she's always there to keep me calm, thank goodness... I am so excited about our competition cheerleading squad, we won first place at our last competition which was totally awesome and we compete in our state competion on February 1 (Scary.....) Well I think I'm going to sign off now. I'll maybe write some more tomorrow. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :heart --><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/godlovers80868/images/heartpump.gif ALT=":heart"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     y'all!<br>

It really helps to know people care. We had the visitation tonight for my grandma and it is hard to keep from crying when people keep hugging you and saying all of those sympathetic things, finally I just had to get away from it before I bawled my eyes out so my brother and I went to go fill the mini-van up with gas. So that gave me some time to regain my composure which was nice. <br>
<br>
You're right stereotypes totally bite! Everyone assumes so many things about you just because of one tiny aspect of your life. Oh well life goes on, right. My mom thinks I'm being completely crazy  putting a journal on the internet where anyone can read it but she thinks I'm crazy most of the time anyways so it doesn't really bother me. My life is so boring that I don't even know why I bother to write about it most of the time.  But what the heck, if I have to bore myself I my as well bore everyone who's dumb enough to read this as well. <br>
<br>
I have a quick question for anyone who reads this. Have you ever heard the praise and worship song that goes like<br>
&quot;Jesus lover of my soul, you know I will never let you go&quot;<br>
I'm not even sure if those are the exact words. People keep telling me it's called Jesus, Lover of My Soul but I can never find that song. It's always a different Jesus Lover of My Soul song.  just thought I'd ask in case anyone could fill me in.<br>

Wow, I surprise even myself... <br>
<br>
Well a quick update for any of you who have been praying for my family and I. The funeral was today which is in a way kind of good but still really sad. It's good because its no longer this big sad event looming over my family and now we can properly say goodbye to my grandma.  But it's so sad because it's so final, you know? Before everything felt really dream-like and now it's finally sinking in that this is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>forever</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>
<br>
Today during the funeral service it was mostly about heaven and the coming of Jesus and about how we're in the &quot;end times,&quot; and I was wondering how everyone else feels about the possibility that Jesus may come to earth again in our life time? I, myself, have mixed feelings on that particular subject. On one hand I'm excited for it, finally getting to see Jesus and spending eternity in Heaven but on the other hand I don't like to think that he'll come before I've had a chance to do all the things I want to do on earth. Get married, have kids, etc. Is that selfish? I know that I'm probably holding on to earthly things, but I just can't help feeling that way sometimes. I realize that I can be pretty selfish and self-centered so I'm working on that. It's a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>slow</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> process sometimes. Does anyone else ever feel that there are so many things that they need to change about themselves that they don't even know where to start? It makes me want to run <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :bolt --><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/godlovers80868/images/bolt.gif ALT=":bolt"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and hide from myself sometimes. <br>
<br>
I think I'm going to sign off now. I am so tired, it's been a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>long</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> weekend. Bye y'all! <br>

I know, I know. It's only been what four days, but this is like a record for me. I am not joking when I say I am really bad at keeping journals.<br>
<br>
Lately I've been thinking a lot about getting married. Not as in I want to get married now, but more as in wondering who my future husband will be, what's he like, have I already met him, etc. Does anyone else like the song by Rebecca St. James &quot;Wait For Me&quot;? I think that song has such an awesome message. I hope my husband is waiting for me. <br>
<br>
 My cousin Kecia just got engaged, she's only 17 (18 in March)!!! I can not believe she can even thinking about getting married much less do it! She says it probably won't be until next spring but still she'll only be 19 at the most. I mean I totally love her and her fiancee Doug and I think it's really cute that they're engaged and are going to get married (by the way you should see &quot;the rock&quot; she's got on her finger. that is one BIG engagement ring! It could seriously run a solar powered car all by itself with all of the diamonds that are on that thing!) but it just seems crazy to be marrying so young. If it's right and it's what God wants them to do, it'll still be right in two years, right? Maybe I'm just being overly cautious. Both of their families are thrilled by the engagement so.. who knows. I think I'm thinking too hard about this. I am so excited to meet the person that I will evantually call my husband. Be still my beating <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :heart --><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/godlovers80868/images/heartpump.gif ALT=":heart"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I better go though, I have to finish my paper for my Oppressions class. I have to write five pages on my activist project before tomorrow! EEK! Well feel free to write back to me, I love to get msgs of any kind. But don't feel you have to, ok? Buh-Bye now y'all! Y'all is like my favorite word of all time but everyone laughs at me cuz I'm from the midwest and it seems just wrong to hear that come out of a Minnesotans mouth! Oh well I guess, to each his own.<br>
Oh Happy Days,<br>

Tune: ABERYSTWITH, Meter: 77.77 D <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
1.        Jesus, lover of my soul, <br>
        let me to thy bosom fly, <br>
        while the nearer waters roll, <br>
        while the tempest still is high. <br>
        Hide me, O my Savior, hide, <br>
        till the storm of life is past; <br>
        safe into the haven guide; <br>
        O receive my soul at last. <br>
<br>
2.        Other refuge have I none, <br>
        hangs my helpless soul on thee; <br>
        leave, ah! leave me not alone, <br>
        still support and comfort me. <br>
        All my trust on thee is stayed, <br>
        all my help from thee I bring; <br>
        cover my defenseless head <br>
        with the shadow of thy wing.<br>
<br>
3.        Thou, O Christ, art all I want, <br>
        more than all in thee I find; <br>
        raise the fallen, cheer the faint, <br>
        heal the sick, and lead the blind. <br>
        Just and holy is thy name, <br>
        I am all unrighteousness; <br>
        false and full of sin I am; <br>
        thou art full of truth and grace. <br>
<br>
4.        Plenteous grace with thee is found, <br>
        grace to cover all my sin; <br>
        let the healing streams abound, <br>
        make and keep me pure within. <br>
        Thou of life the fountain art, <br>
        freely let me take of thee; <br>

We placed third in our division! It was great, I know, I know third isn't first but to us it was awesome! This is only our third competition ever so... for a totally inexperienced squad to win third, rocks! And to top it all off every competition we've been in so far this year we've gotten a trophy! We got second in North Dakota and first at Apple Valley and now third at state! I am so excited. We left home at 6 in the morning and then drove for three hours to our competition. And then we had to sit around for three more hours until it was time for our division to compete. We were so nervous beforehand but after it was over we ran off in hysterics cuz we were really happy with the way our routine went. Our stunts went up and stayed up which was a huge relief because a lot squads were dropping stunts (but I guess that can be expected, I was surprised ours went up so well). <br>
<br>
And then to make the day even better I then got to go shopping and I bought my prom dress for only $90! And it's just gorgeous, it's red. And then today we went shopping again at the Mall of America and I bought red shoes to match. But they have like four inch heels so I'm praying I won't break an ankle. I've been practicing walking in them and it just feels so odd. It's a good thing I'm not a ballet dancer, I don't think I could stay upright on toe shoes. I've gotta go though I've got stuff to do. <br>

I must have the most boring life ever. I work, I cheerlead, and I go to school that's all. Goodness, I need to get a life. I just got the newest book in the Diary of a Teenage Girl series, it was really good. I love books, they are just the best things ever. I could spend hours just curled up with a book (or actually probably several since I read so fast). Tonight is Burning Bush! *F.Y.I. Burning Bush is a youth praise and worship night thing that happens the first Wednesday of every month, it's awesome!*  I'm really excited too because my best friend (who isn't really into anything christian like that) is coming, I'm hoping that something said tonight will touch her heart. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I feel like I must be the world's worst christian, it's such a depressing feeling. I just have those days where it seems like I have a lot more doubts than I should be allowed to have. Everyone always says its okay to have doubts but I look around and it seems like everyone else has this perfect christian life (yeah I know they aren't perfect either but that's how it feels sometimes) and I feel like a really big doubting failure.  <br>
<br>
Life is good, I guess. Although this war with Iraq keeps me worrying a lot. I don't know about anybody else but I have a huge fear of biological and chemical weapons being used on the U.S. I'm scared that this war is going to turn nuclear and we'll end up blowing up half the world. Also my cousin Travis is over fighting in Iraq right now, he's a marine. I'm really proud of him, but it's scary to think of what could happen to him. <br>
<br>
I have to go make supper because my mom decided to take the night off from cooking. Bye y'all.<br>

I came online 'cuz I was going to write more on my story, but I decided that I'd rather write here. I can't wait for prom. My prom is on May 10 and I'm so not ready for it. I just finalized who I was going with two days ago. We're buying tickets next week which is good. All my friends and their dates are all going out to eat beforehand at this awesome restaurant on the lake. I hope the weather stays as nice as it has been here. <br>
<br>
I've been thinking about myself and I've decided that I am quite possibly the strangest person I've ever met. I'm just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>weird</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I can entertain myself for hours and hours on end. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I'm the only one who can understand myself and that is one of the coolest things ever. I think that keeping certain things private about yourself helps you to know who you are totally and completely. It allows you to form your own opinions and thoughts. I'm really only truly myself when I'm alone. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I think that everything I like to say I am is one big fat lie. I've gotten so good at pretending to be someone else that I don't even know who I really am. It's scary to think that everything you thought you were is really just a mask you wear to fool the people around you. <br>
<br>
It's so weird that I choose to put some of my innermost thoughts in an online journal that thousands of random people could read at any given moment if they choose to. Although I don't know why anyone would waste perfectly good time reading the somewhat inane thoughts of a seventeen year old girl. It seems so secure to write here. There's anonymity here. <br>
<br>
I better go, it's getting late and I have to work again in the morning. Peace Out.<br>

My mom has been throwing up all night and I'm pretty sure I got whatever she has because I feel horrible! I'm still going to go but I'm not so sure about post prom. My friend and I are all going out to dinner and I'm not looking forward to that since I have no intention of eating anything in hopes that that will enable me not to throw up during grand march. I get sick at the worst possible times. I was throwing up on my birthday (which is December 20) all the way through Christmas and now I'm going to start throwing up on prom night! I have a really bad track record. Although I'm not actually looking forward to prom very much, the closer it gets the more I'm dreading it. The only part I'm really going to like is getting dressed up and looking pretty. <br>
<br>
I have to go now, I'm going to my friend Ashley's house and she's going to do my hair. Bye.<br>

1. Date comes to pick me up. Family proceeds to completely humiliate me and practically kills my date with embarassment.<br>
<br>
2. We drive to dinner. Conversation is not flowing. It is so awkward trying to go on a romantic date with a friend. (He was trying to make it romantic, not me).<br>
<br>
3. Get to dinner. My stomach still feels horrible so I can't eat a thing. I sit there and chug down 7-up like it's going out of style.<br>
<br>
4. Drive to school for grand march. Once again conversation is stilted and basically boring.<br>
<br>
5. We get to grand march and have to wait in the lobby for about an hour with everyone and their brother trying to get pictures of us. I keep losing my date so I spend half the time trying to track him down. Not fun.<br>
<br>
6. We get to go wait in line for grand march. We're the 90th couple so we wait in line for an HOUR! Very dull and of course my stomach still hurts! <br>
<br>
7. Finally go through grand march. That wasn't bad it was actually kind of fun.<br>
<br>
8. Dance starts. Stomach has gotten progressively worse and I end up crying because I feel so bad and it's prom night and I'm basically a very self-pitying person. I, of course, do not let my date see this, he can only see the &quot;pretending I'm happy&quot; me. I try to act as if I'm having fun while all the while feeling miserable. I do have the occassional fine time with my friends but of course all that dancing made my stomach feel worse.<br>
<br>
9. The dance is supposed to go till midnight but at 11:30 I've had enough. I just want to go home and my date offers to bring me there. Conversation on the way home is horrible. I spend the whole time apologizing for being such a horrible, horrible date and he acts as if he doesn't believe me about being sick (jerk.) Plus he keeps apologizing for his miserable slow dancing faux paus (he'd never slow danced before, let's just say... it wasn't pretty!)<br>
<br>
10. I end up spending half the night at home puking while everyone else enjoys going to post prom. <br>
<br>
That concludes my prom night from h, e, double hockey sticks. All I've got to say is story of my life! I've decided I'm never going to prom again. Although I do reserve the right to change my mind if need be. <br>
<br>
So..... Love and What Not,<br>

It really was that bad though, I swear. But I'm slowly but surely working through it with the help of my trusty therapist. <br>
<br>
Today we had a fundraiser for our mission trip and guess what it was, yes that's right CAR WASHING! It wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't been raining outside and 40 degrees with a windchill of about -67 degrees. I don't mind car-washing but when I'm wearing wet clothes that are freezing to me and shoes that squish up water between my toes when I walk that's where I draw the line. <br>
<br>
But I stayed the whole time from eight this morning until two this afternoon and now I have to go work at A&amp;W. Although working isn't so bad, it's going to be fun cuz tonight I work with my cousins Kecia and Mandy. I love those girls! I love working at A&amp;W, everyone is just so awesome that works there and the customers are usually pretty happy campers and waitressing is a blast. It's just all around good times. <br>
<br>
I'm going to go though. Maybe I'll write more of my story, or maybe not. Who knows. <br>
Love y'all,<br>

Sometimes it seems llike I'm super busy and other times I have all sorts of time to just laze around. I went to bible camp one, or was it two?, weeks ago and that was the best time I've had in a long time. Our speaker's name was Afton Timothy and she totally rocked.  It was unbelievable what God did at camp. We have a thing they call U-turn night and it's kind of an altar call type thing for those who want to become a christian, renew their relationship with Jesus, or for those who just need to talk and pray with someone. My whole cabin ended up staying at U-Turn and it was really cool to see God break us all down. <br>
<br>
I've been doing a little girl cheer camp for the past few days and the little girls are the cutest things I've ever seen. They all just think us &quot;big cheerleaders&quot; are cool and they all just hang on us. It's really sweet the way they hug us and fight over who gets to hold our hands and sit by us. I'm supposed to be sorting clothes but I felt the urge to write since I haven't done it in a long time. I've noticed that I'm very susceptible to my whims. I go wherever strikes my fancy at the time and do whatever sounds like fun at the moment. It's probably a fault to be so driven by my whims. But I've also noticed that I have a pretty good moral system so somehow I manage to not do anything too bad. I've never really felt the urge to go out and drink and party and make-out with random boys who I just met. My whims are usually much more G-rated. <br>
<br>
I had better go before my mom discovers me down here typing in my journal, she'll blow a fuse! Bye...<br>

Lately I've been trying to decide what to do about college and my &quot;future.&quot; I've been freakin' out about it too. I can't decide where to go to college at, what to major in, what I want to do with the rest of my life, or anything. It's horrible. I think I'm going to give myself indigestion before long.  I hate decisions and these are HUGE decisions, not just &quot;what I should I eat&quot; type decisions. AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH! Life is scary that's for sure. <br>

I write in this journal really sporadically, but when I have something I need to write about I always find myself coming here to write my worries on a board where millions of people could potentially read them. Weird. Not that millions would ever read this, but the possibility is always there.<br>
<br>
Our cheerleading team competed yesterday. We got fourth although we should have gotten third and we would have if we hadn't gotten a deduction. One of the girls on the squad lost her hair ribbon and we lost ten points! That sucks, but its all good we were really happy with how we performed, we did everything we wanted to and that's what counts, right? Right.<br>

I better go though I have to meet my friend Nicole for supper.<br>
