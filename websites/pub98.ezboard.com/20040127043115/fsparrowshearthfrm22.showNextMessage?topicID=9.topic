<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast. - Eph. 2:8-9<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin. - Rom. 3:20<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
To say that one must be baptized to become a Christian is to make baptism law.  And the law does not save.  Though the verse refers to the Old Covenant law, it can transpire to mean any law.  And that law was created by God.  The law God created could not save us because the law was focused on man's efforts and man could not save himself.  Baptism is something man does - it is an effort on man's part - therefore it also can not save us.<br>
<br>
Only God can save us, through Christ.  Jesus did all the work for salvation and we can't do anything to earn or manipulate that salvation.  We either accept it or we don't.  We don't have to get wet to accept it.<br>
<br>
Baptism by water is nothing more than an outward display of the choice we already made to accept salvation.  I became a Christian long before I was ever baptized (and I don't count the infant sprinkling as baptism).  You can't tell me I wasn't a Christian before I was baptized, I know I was, God proved His salvation to be real in me in a very strong and personal way immediately after I had made that choice.  So I know from personal experience that baptism isn't what saves.  For I accepted Jesus in my heart one night and I remember the next morning I was literally bouncing off the walls with an unexplained joy that at that time I could not understand.  It was the Holy Spirit coming alive me for the first time, and I hadn't been baptized and I wouldn't be for a long time.  Why was I finally baptized?  Out of obedience, because I came to believe it was something God wanted of all believers as a physical sign to the world of who we have chosen as our God.<br>
<br>
Why did the early Christians do water baptism?  Because Jesus experienced water baptism and this was a way that His followers could identify themselves with Him.  No other religion in the world had or has such a practice.  It identifies us to the world that we belong to Christ.<br>
<br>
But salvation is something the world can not see.  It is invisible and something that only God and the one who is saved knows for certain.  You're already saved by the time you are baptized, at least you should be, because if you think just the act of getting wet saves you, you might want to rethink the relationship with God.  Prayer is involved, you've got to talk to God yourself because God is a relational God.  You really can't go through the motions and not talk to Him and be saved, I don't see how that's even possible.<br>
<br>
Water baptism is an act of obedience to tell the world who we belong to.  It comes after we've already received salvation.<br>
<br>
Now a good question would be, do the verses about baptism in the Bible all refer to water baptism?  I don't think so. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

Yes: Matt 3:11 &quot;I indeed baptize you in water unto penance, but he that shall come after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire&quot;<br>
<br>
Better hop into the BBQ darkhamster to get baptized.<br>
<br>
But if you in your anti-intellectual pride had spent the time to read the article, rather than merely dismissing scholarship in favour of your own person interpretation of the Bible, you would have realized that I was not refering to the method of Baptism, but the essense of it as sacrament: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but I think that it is necessary to define what Baptism is exactly before any conversation can proceed<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Notice: &quot;what Baptism is&quot;, not &quot;how to baptize&quot;.<br>
<br>
To save you the strenuous activity of reading a whole article, I will quote the threefold theological distinction: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Fathers and theologians frequently divide baptism into three kinds: the baptism of water (aquæ or fluminis), the baptism of desire (flaminis), and the baptism of blood (sanguinis). However, only the first is a real sacrament. The latter two are denominated baptism only analogically, inasmuch as they supply the principal effect of baptism, namely, the grace which remits sins. It is the teaching of the Catholic Church that when the baptism of water becomes a physical or moral impossibility, eternal life may be obtained by the baptism of desire or the baptism of blood. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm#X">www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm#X</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Besides, Paul himself was Baptized in a house standing up (likely with water poored on his head): <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And Ananias went his way and entered into the house. And laying his hands upon him, he said: Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus hath sent me, he that appeared to thee in the way as thou camest, that thou mayest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales: and he received his sight. And rising up, he was baptized. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> (Acts 9:1-18)<br>
<br>
And the Didache (100 AD- predating some NT books) clearly states: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Chapter 7. Concerning Baptism. And concerning baptism, baptize this way: Having first said all these things, baptize into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in living water. But if you have no living water, baptize into other water; and if you cannot do so in cold water, do so in warm. But <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">if you have neither, pour out water three times upon the head into the name of Father and Son and Holy Spirit.</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> But before the baptism let the baptizer fast, and the baptized, and whoever else can; but you shall order the baptized to fast one or two days before. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

No one but the modern fundamentalists have made an issue of baptism by immersion vs. sprinkling. It is a red herring at best. If baptism is necessary for salvation, I guess according to you darkmast, St. Paul is not saved.<br>

This is exactly why I wanted to create a &quot;Tournaments&quot; forum.
