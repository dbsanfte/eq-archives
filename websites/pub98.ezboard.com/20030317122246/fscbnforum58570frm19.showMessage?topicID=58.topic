(long) = KirieRavenwing</span><hr size=1> The whisper of silk against skin, and a heart suddenly pounding rapidly. Footsteps drawing closer. Inhale, pound, pound, pound, pound, exhale, step, step..<br>
<br>
Marie looked up from her desk to see Anne walking in, a lovely red-headed bit of Irish fire Marie had in her services for many years. Her senses told her Anne knew something was disturbing, aside from such nonsensical health issues with her club.<br>
<br>
Anne deposited The Black Swan's business mail on Marie's desk and handed her mistress an envelope. Marie scanned it quickly... sent within the city, no fingerprints, and apparently hand-written in Apple Chauncery font.<br>
<br>
<br>
What a moron, Marie thought privately, What kind of idiot writes a computer font?<br>
<br>
Her question would be soon answered as she slit open the letter.<br>
<br>
<br>
It read:<br>
<br>
My Dearest Marie Mercer-Reinald,<br>
(&quot;They can't even spell my name right, Anne. Isn't that funny?&quot; &quot;In a sick sort of way, maybe, Marie.&quot;)<br>
Let me introduce mysellf to you by apologizing for any inconvenience you may have suffered as a result of my actions. I am referring, of course, to the sudden closings of several establishments this past Friday owned by people of our kind -- including yourself. It was a somewhat clumsy demonstration of my power, I know, but unfortunately I fear the present political climate prevents me from initiating more intimate contact with you or those you rule over -- and I felt it neccessary to get your attention.<br>
I also must apologize for the apparent gross breach of etiquette I committed when I initially entered this city. It was, if I understand correctly, a strange political time for the domain, which, I think, resulted in several unfortunate and regrettable misunderstandings. <br>
Allow me to burden you with a brief history of myself. I am from, what somwone in your position might call a disadvantaged embrace. My sire, you see, wasn't much for instructing his children on the ways of the Kindred world. A Malkavian Anarch, he saw something in me which appently interested him, and he hastily Embraced and Released me all of within the space of about ten minutes. He made some rather vague references to the other clans, the Camarilla and the Sabbat, all of which I've since learned more about, though not before I made a few... mis-steps. <br>
I realize, of course, that I have trespassed against you. Therefore, I wish to offer my services to you, personally. Those who hold your position do not appear to have a particularly long life-expectancy, and even now, I cannot believe you or any prudent ruler could ever feel totally secure.<br>
I can help you with that. I can go where you cannot, see what you cannot, hear what you cannot. I can expose the vipers who plot against you, and with time I think you will be quite pleased that you decided to allow me to live in your city.<br>
I will be watching to see what your decsion regarding my status comes to. Oh, don't worry; no one in your populace is &quot;spying&quot; on my behalf - at least not yet. I have other methods of discovering such things -- methods which, perhaps, you will find very beneficial to you if you take advantage of my offer.<br>
If not, if I am doomed to play the role of the villain in this drama, if we are destined to be enemies, well.... I'm sure at the very least we'll have some fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>
Raven<br>
<br>
<br>
p.s. Do you know why my sire named me Raven, Highness? It is because he said I was a harbinger of things to come. I dearly hope my presence will come to bring good tidings for you and your rule.<br>
<br>
<br>
Marie chuckled to herself. A Malkavian Anarch. Perhaps it would have been better if the Bloodhunted Raven of Clan Malkavian had typed it, at least he could have spell-checked it. She leaned back and laughed quietly, the bitter laugh of an editor and critic of many years.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's a romantic fool, cursed by true delusions instead of the gift of insight most Malkavians usually get.&quot; Marie pushed the letter at the girl.<br>
<br>
Anne quietly collected up the letter and read it herself, shaking her head. &quot;Isn't he Bloodhunted, Mistress?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Anne, he is. Just like me to get fan-mail, I suppose. I guess I'm so terribly popular, I draw in all the 'good ones'.&quot; The Toreador Prince sighed quietly, her mirth gradually subsiding.<br>
<br>
Who knows how long it'd been since Marie truly laughed? Her laughter wasn't a merry, polite social laugh. It was the laugh of the Temptress as someone walked right into her trap. Behind steel-blue eyes and a beautiful face rested the keen intellect and mind of an older vampire who'd learned to live, despite the odds. She wasn't about to let this little Malkavian Anarch threaten her Populace. No, no. Santa Carla had chosen wisely the day they asked her to claim the Domain. She would whole-heartedly keep it as free from Anarchs, Sabbat, and other such horrible threats, so as to allow the city to flourish in safety under the wing of the Camarilla.<br>
<br>
Strange to think that the little annoying whipping boy of Clan Ventrue had all-too eagerly come forth and offered his assistance to &quot;clear things up&quot; with that creepy, knowing smile. Crowley, yes! That was his name. Marie carefully filed away such thoughts in the back of her mind for later consideration and investigation.<br>
<br>
Dumb birds, when will they learn not to fly into glass windows? she thought to herself quietly, rapidly typing out several announcements.<br>
<br>
<br>
Several minutes later, satisfied, Marie meandered downstairs from her office to the back room in her club where she posted all announcements.<br>
<br>
<br>
To my beloved populace of the Domain of Santa Carla:<br>
<br>
There is a reward for the Kindred who spots, finds, or otherwise provides information on the whereabouts that leads to the capture of, the Bloodhunted Kindred Raven of Clan Malkavian.<br>
<br>
He has attacked far too many Kindred within this Domain, on battlegrounds outside of claw and fist, and must be brought down with all swiftness, lest his little games and charades bring unwanted attention and possible breaches of the First Tradition.<br>
<br>
He is to be considered highly unstable and dangerous, do not approach him yourself lest you put yourself in harm's way.<br>
<br>
Please contact the Scourge, the Sherrif, the Seneschal, myself, or your Primogen.<br>
<br>
My thanks in advance,<br>
<br>
Princess Marie Mercer-Renald of Santa Carla, Clan Toreador<br>
<br>
<br>
Marie finished pinning the neatly typed announcement, and appropriate contact information below. Dusting off her hands, she sighed to herself quietly, and pinned up a second announcement.<br>
<br>
To all Kindred within the Domain of Santa Carla,<br>
<br>
It has been brought to my attention that several Baalli are within the city. They are extremely dangerous so as to make the threat of Bloodhunted Raven to seem like a joke. I assure you all, it is a very serious issue, and anyone who knows anything of their goings-on or whereabouts is requested to inform the Sherrif, the Seneschal, or myself immediately, with all haste.<br>
<br>
It is my belief that they are beginning to attack members of our populace, and must be found before they can further their dangerous, twisted plans.<br>
<br>
If you feel you can help the Officers of the city to identify the threat and help eliminate it, please, again, with all haste, contact us and volunteer immediately.<br>
<br>
The safety of our Domain is each and every Kindred's responsibility, but do not neglect your own safety. Use caution, and do not approach these Baalli yourself. Bring the information to us, status and prestige, and possibly reward depending on how much you help, will be granted to everyone who assists in eliminating the threat.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, my warmest thanks,<br>
<br>
Princess Marie Mercer-Renald of Santa Carla, Clan Toreador<br>
<br>
<br>
The Toreador sighed to herself, stepping back, fussing with the adjustment of the papers here and there, until it was completely artistically pleasing.<br>
<br>
Well. As pleasing as a bunch of announcements can be. The fact that she'd considered announcements as even being vaguely reminiscent of true art almost amused her again.<br>
<br>
Just then, Marie's cell-phone rang. She grumbled quietly, for a moment looking almost like a little girl again, for the first time in well over a century or more.<br>
<br>
&quot;No rest for the weary,&quot; she clicked open her phone, &quot;Hello? ...&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=58.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=58.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.222<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
