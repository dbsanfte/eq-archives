Rating: strong R<br>
Category: UST/Angst – Chloe/Lionel<br>
Spoilers: Everything up through Exodus is fair game.<br>
Summary: Chloe is spending the summer in Metropolis because of her internship at The Daily Planet, and hears a song on the radio that makes her muse about the recent agreement that she has entered into with Lionel Luthor.<br>
Disclaimer: Not mine, no infringement intended, please don’t sue.<br>
Feedback: If you like the ship, then yes, I’d love to have your feedback.<br>
Archival: Sure – just let me know where.<br>
Author’s Note: The song is “In The Cold, Cold, Night” by The White Stripes, which amazingly enough, I don’t own any of the rights to; but the song just seemed to fit this couple so well, so I’m borrowing it.  Also, if you don’t like or approve of the pairing for whatever reason, please don’t read it.  My fragile ego can only take so much, and hearing people complain about a particular pairing rather than how the fic is written itself just irks me.  This is dedicated to HumbugGirl (Carmen) because she has been my main source of fics for this ship thus far.  That, and I sort of missed her birthday.  Sorry hon.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe listened as the plucking of guitar strings lilted through the radio, barely audible over the sound of the hot water filling the oversized, old-fashioned claw tub in her cousin Lois’s apartment.  She had gotten another internship with The Daily Planet and had jumped at the chance to spend the summer in Metropolis, but this time it wasn’t because of her journalistic dreams.  This time it was because she needed to escape everything that Smallville had been throwing at her.<br>
<br>
Clark and Lana had finally gotten together, and although she had been expecting it, the expectation didn’t seem to make her heart hurt any less when it had actually happened.  If anything, it had pained her more because of the fact that neither one of them had apparently felt that her feelings were important enough to tell her the truth afterward.  At least not until she had confronted Clark about it the next afternoon.  <br>
<br>
He said that he had been busy – as always.  Always too busy for her or her feelings, but if Lana wanted him to watch her in an equestrian competition, then he would find the time to be there for her – even if it meant blowing off an article that he promised to have done for The Torch, which essentially meant blowing Chloe off.  <br>
<br>
She had gone to warn him about Lionel Luthor and his sudden interest in him, but when she saw them kissing in the barn, she couldn’t bring herself to interrupt them, her tears clouding the issue.  So, she drove to the farm again the next day, and what she had meant to be a warning turned into a confrontation.  She balled her hands into fists and swiftly walked away, one thought repeating through her head like a mantra. <br>
<br>
Maybe Clark didn’t need to know that Lionel was investigating him, maybe he didn’t deserve to know.  <br>
<br>
Still, her inquisitive nature wouldn’t let the ‘why’ drop from the equation.  Chloe went to Lionel soon after, told him that she accepted his offer to investigate Clark for him.  All she had wanted was to find out why Lionel was so interested in a person she now considered her former best friend, she really had no intention of delivering any harmful information about the Kents to him.  Then something completely unexpected had happened.<br>
<br>
As Lionel was showing her out the door, he touched her.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I saw you standing in the corner</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>On the edge of a burning light</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I saw you standing in the corner</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Come to me again, in the cold, cold night</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She assured herself that the skimming of his hand along her shoulder and back was probably an entirely innocent gesture on his part, but it had sent an unspeakable rush of blood through her body that settled between her legs.  She was thankful that he was standing half behind her and couldn’t see the way her eyes closed with the action, or the way her skin flushed with a shiver of pleasure.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You make me feel a little older,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Like a full grown woman might</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But when you’re gone I grow colder,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Come to me again in the cold, cold night</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The words from the song jarred her memory of how she had gone home, satisfying herself with the image of someone other than Clark for the first time that night.  The older man, clearly unattainable in Chloe’s mind had sparked a sexual desire in her that she found difficult to quench and she found herself ducking her head to prevent him from seeing her blush every time they met.  <br>
<br>
When it came time to leave for Metropolis for the internship, she practically placed her foot all the way down on her car’s gas petal and drove as fast as she could to escape the torturous embarrassment she felt at having unrequited feelings for someone yet again, someone who, unlike Clark, actually made time to speak with her; and that time was spent desperately trying to push her desires aside so she could keep up a simple conversation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I see you walking by my front door</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I don’t care what other people say</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I’m going to love you, anyway</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Come to me again in the cold, cold night</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Chloe slipped off her fuzzy robe and stepped into the steaming hot tub.  Despite the fact that it was the middle of summer, an out of the ordinary cold wave had hit that section of Kansas, even bringing a few snow flurries with it.  <br>
<br>
She sighed as she relaxed back into the tub, closing her eyes and resting the back of her neck on the porcelain behind her.  Lois had thankfully been called out of town on one of her first junior reporting gigs and Chloe had the apartment to herself.  No Lois blathering on about how she was going to be a star reporter one day, or how she couldn’t believe that her younger cousin had gotten an interview with Lex Luthor when he turned practically everybody else down.  <br>
<br>
The latter topic had been the main discussion as of late because of Lex’s plane crash.  No bodies had been found, but everyone assumed that he, Helen, and the pilot had died in the crash.  Chloe, however, had a sneaking suspicion that it wasn’t true.  No matter how much animosity lay between Lex and his father, Lionel would have shown some sort of emotion if he really believed that his son was dead.  So, until Lionel conceded that his eldest son was deceased, Chloe would presume that he wasn’t.<br>
<br>
Chloe frowned.  She had seen many of Lionel’s faces, including the stone-like one that he so often carried.  Perhaps he did think that Lex was dead and she was just choosing to believe that he wasn’t the heartless bastard that everyone thought he was.  <br>
<br>
“Innocence is bliss,” she muttered to herself, her fingers trailing down her stomach under the water until they reached her curls.  She sucked in a breath as she brushed over her clit, lightly at first, but progressively harder and more intense.  Her other hand joined the first one but went lower, stroking her silken folds and then pushing a finger into herself.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I can’t stand it any longer</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I need the fuel to make my fire bright</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So don’t fight it any longer</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Come to me again, in the cold, cold night</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She pumped one finger in and out of herself, soon adding another and matching the rhythm of the first hand rubbing her clit.  She imagined that it wasn’t her shorter fingers, but the long, skilled fingers of the man who had been haunting her dreams since she felt him touch her so innocently.  <br>
<br>
Chloe let out a series of whimpers and grunts that were never too loud due to experience she had while Lana and her dad were in the house.  As her arousal beat through her body, the muscles in her stomach began to tighten and her breathing became ragged.  She picked up the pace of her thrusting fingers and added another, hitting her clit harder as she stroked her inner walls.<br>
<br>
With one last pump and strangled moan of his name, her hips bucked under the water, splashing the hot liquid over the side of the tub and sending an orgasm rolling through her body.  She panted for breath in the aftermath, and even though the climax had temporarily settled the throbbing ache between her legs for the time being, she could already feel the blood flow rushing down to the apex of her thighs once again.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And I know that you feel it too,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>When my skin turns into glue,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You will know that it’s warm inside</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And you’ll come run to me,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>In the cold, cold night</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She let out a small groan and started to push herself out of the tub.  Her own ministrations wouldn’t be enough to satisfy the sexual hunger she felt and she wondered briefly if her cousin had a vibrator stashed away somewhere, grimacing immediately after the thought of using someone else’s toy for her own pleasure.  <br>
<br>
‘Well, I suppose I could always use the fake I.D. she got me to get into a club or something,’ Chloe thought to herself.  ‘I mean, every guy there is going to be drunk and horny, may as well take advantage of something that no one will ever know about.  Of course, with my luck…’  She quickly dismissed the idea of a one night stand and sighed as she dried herself off and tied the robe around her once again.  <br>
<br>
Her head swung toward the sound of a knock on the door.  It was loud and persistent, which probably meant that whoever was on the other side had been out there for a while.  <br>
<br>
“Shit.”<br>
<br>
One of Lois’s friends had probably heard the whole thing and was now going to either tease her endlessly about it or tell her cousin so she could tease her endlessly about it.  She contemplated not opening the door, but remembered that Lois said she was expecting an important delivery in the time that she was going to be gone and, knowing her cousin’s temper, decided that it wouldn’t hurt just to see who it was.  Her feet padded across the living room to the front door and she stood on her tip-toes to look through the peephole.  <br>
<br>
Her eyes widened almost comically and her mouth opened slightly before she closed it and swallowed a dry gulp.  Chloe undid the deadbolt and turned the knob, slowly letting the door creak open.  <br>
<br>
“Mr. Luthor,” she managed to get out, her voice sounding much calmer and more confident than she actually felt.  “What are you doing here?”<br>
<br>
Lionel’s eyes raked over her body and he smirked at her as he met her questioning gaze.<br>
<br>
“Do you open the door for everyone just wearing a towel or am I special?”<br>
<br>
‘You have no idea,’ she thought to herself and then forced a tight grin onto her lips.  “I saw you through the peephole,” she explained.  “And since you’ve managed to track me down at my cousin’s apartment, I figured it must be important.”  Lionel nodded once and then grinned at her as she stepped aside in an unspoken invitation to allow him inside, noticing the way she tried to make the way she smelled him seem like a simple draw of breath.<br>
<br>
“My people think they may have found your young Mr. Kent,” he said carefully, gauging her reaction.<br>
<br>
“He’s not *my* Mr. Kent,” she said quietly and then started toward the couch.  “Is he okay?”<br>
<br>
Lionel was silent for a moment as he followed her over to the ratty sofa and, to her surprise, sat down next to her, relaxing one arm over the back, within inches of having it draped across her shoulders.  Chloe lightly bit her lower lip, knowing that if he stayed in that position much longer that she might risk losing what little dignity she felt she had left by jumping him.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe,” Lionel started, snapping Chloe out of whatever naughty daydream she was in.  She forced herself to focus on his eyes rather than his smooth, almost husky voice.  “Before I begin, I think there’s something you should know.”  Chloe blinked and Lionel took it as a sign to continue.  “You ---” he trailed off, looking uncharacteristically unsure of what he was going to say.  Instead of speaking again, he removed his arm from the back of the couch and moved his thumb along her cheek and jaw, reaching back into her hair to bring their faces closer.<br>
<br>
The kiss was gentle, possessing a sweet quality that Chloe would have never expected Lionel was capable of.  He pulled back ever so slightly, searching her eyes for…acceptance?  Chloe closed the space between them again, scooting her hips closer to him as the second kiss deepened quickly, her hands on his shoulders as their tongues slid against each other, probing each other’s warm, wet mouths.  She pulled back to breathe, giving him the same questioning look that he had just given her.  <br>
<br>
“I ---”<br>
<br>
Lionel kissed her again, interrupting any protest that she could have been about to make.  His hand trailed along the side of her body, drifting across the terrycloth of her robe as if it were silk before tugging at the strand of fabric that held it closed.  He nipped at her neck gently, observing the goosebumps that crawled across her skin as the robe fell open, exposing her soft, naked flesh to him.<br>
<br>
“You’re cold,” he murmured, nudging his mouth up her neck until he could take her earlobe in between his teeth.  Chloe felt another shiver pass through her with his warm breath blowing into her ear.  “Let me warm you up.”  It came out so light that it was almost a whisper; the seductive, yet pleading quality to his tone only serving to make her want him more.  She swallowed once in disbelief and then gave a small nod of her head. <br>
<br>
Even if it was just this once, even it was only to make sure that she had come over to his side completely, she wasn’t going to turn him down.  She needed this, needed to feel him inside her, needed to know that she wasn’t completely alone or undesirable, and he was offering to give her that, whether he knew it yet or not.  <br>
