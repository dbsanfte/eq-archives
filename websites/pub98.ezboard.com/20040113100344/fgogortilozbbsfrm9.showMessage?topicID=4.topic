'Gogortiloz Investigates' page that was recently added to <br>
gogortiloz.com. <br>
<br>
This investigation conducted by Don Gogortiloz was hilarious <br>
and very well thought out to say the least. <br>
<br>
The people encountered during the investigation ( i.e. <br>
lazyking, snakeeye, and dreamgurl) are a vast and growing <br>
part of the Armenian community that would rather think and <br>
act &quot;black&quot; so to say and try to integrate and associate <br>
'violence, drugs, and thuggin and reppin' with being <br>
Armenian because thats what 50 Cent and Tupac and the <br>
unfortunate thug culture that seems to be present in L.A is <br>
telling them to do. They're so caught up in trying to prove <br>
themselves to their homeboyz and homegurlz and 'rep and <br>
thug' that they don't stop around to see if what they're doing is <br>
completely unappropriate and disrespectful to anyone who <br>
calls themself Armenian. Being Armenian is NOT supposed <br>
to be associated with fighting and gangs and fixed up cars . <br>
<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with people liking rap music and <br>
listening to the likes of 50 cent and Tupac and acting like <br>
they're black and kickin' it wit their crew, afterall it is a free <br>
country and people can do as they please, but when these <br>
people ( who Armenians make a major composite of) try to <br>
pass off their actions and crumbling values as what makes <br>
someone &quot;Armenian,&quot; thats when I feel that I have to speak <br>
out, because even though I know that what theyre saying and <br>
representing does not in any way have anything to do with <br>
being Armenian, what would an outsider think looking in?? <br>
<br>
<br>
If you thoroughly read the investigation, you might recognize <br>
a couple of the points I'm about to bring up. <br>
<br>
In one of his latter more hostile posts, LazyKing says &quot; u the <br>
pussy type of armos that put are name down. u aint no fighter <br>
fooo and fo sho u aint on my level&quot; <br>
<br>
- Now, lets forget the terrible grammar and spelling and <br>
move on to whats shocking. He's saying that &quot;Quasi&quot; is the <br>
type of Armo that puts our name down because he aint a <br>
fighter and fosho he aint on [lazyking's] level. I find this <br>
statement so utterly ridiculous.This is where I really felt the <br>
need to laugh out loud. LazyKing has his head so far up his <br>
own vorig and is so caught up with livin the thug life and <br>
proving that he's on the top level,( whatever that may be, I <br>
dunno) that he fails to realize that HE's the only one thats <br>
putting our name down. <br>
<br>
<br>
Snake eye on the other hand seems to be more civil and less <br>
hostile than his homeboy LazyKing. However, when &quot;Quasi&quot; <br>
confirms that money is no problem, Snake eye lets &quot;Quasi&quot; <br>
know that he is more than willing to help him out and take <br>
care of a few things (or people) even if it his homeboy <br>
LazyKing. Wow what a &quot;crew,&quot; I'm sure they've always got <br>
each others back. <br>
<br>
<br>
Now comes in DreamGurl. She has more black friends than <br>
Armenian friends and is already in that brainwashed mode of <br>
sevootooyn, which comes as no surprise. She prefers black <br>
guys over Armenian guys and might even end up marrying <br>
one. She can't wait to become a fashion designer that <br>
designs really open clothes. All I can say is what a shame. <br>
Its very unfortunate that she thinks this way and that her <br>
parents don't say anything to discourage or discipline or <br>
show her the right way. Really though, its not her fault, it all <br>
comes down to her parents. If they had raised her the right <br>
way and maybe kept an eye on her and taught her to think for <br>
herself, then maybe it wouldn't seem like she'd choose being <br>
black over being Armenian anyday. <br>
<br>
<br>
Theres much more I could've said, but I'll stop right here. I <br>
dunno how much longer of this black culture integration I <br>
can take. The Armenian youth seem to be becoming more <br>
and more brainwashed into these supposed thug ways <br>
everday and I have a feeling its not going to stop anytime <br>
soon. This investigation has just shown us first hand whats <br>
happening to the Armenian community and how its effecting <br>
everyone that calls themself Armenian. It presents itself as a <br>
major problem and I dunno if there will ever be a solution to <br>
it, but I do know that having gogortiloz.com around will <br>
always provide an outlet for those who like me, and The Don <br>
see the Armenian community and being Armenian for what it <br>
really is. <br>

categories; TOO STRICT or NOT STRICT <br>
ENOUGH. The latter being the case concerning <br>
'urdreamgrl' <br>
<br>
Here is a girl with all the innocence of an average <br>
15 year old, but has unfortunately not been given <br>
any guidance by her parents. <br>
<br>
When children show maturity, kindness, <br>
responsibility, and other positive behaviors, we <br>
usually give parents the credit. By the same token, <br>
when a child has real problems, we're quick to <br>
assume that bad parenting is somehow to blame. <br>
<br>
But the assumption that parenting is the ONLY <br>
thing that determines a child's development is not <br>
always true. Lots of other factors influence how a <br>
child develops, including genetics, economics, <br>
culture, neighborhood life, siblings, and other even <br>
the gerragoorr they consume. <br>
<br>
This girl and the rest of the Armenian girls in her <br>
age group have been spending far too much time <br>
with members of the black race. That's the bottom <br>
line. <br>
<br>
What is wrong with this you may ask? <br>
<br>
Nothing, if you are strong willed enough not to <br>
adopt traits you see in the people you are <br>
surrounded by day in day out. But how many strong <br>
willed 15 year olds do you know? <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that no <br>
Armenian should associate with members of the <br>
black race, but come on...these kind of girls are <br>
specifically surrouding themselves with <br>
sevamorrts in order to promote their so called <br>
&quot;coolness&quot;. It's ridiculous. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> chichu</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF0000>(10/30/03 5:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fgogortilozbbsfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   sticking together</span><hr size=1> Among other things, the Investigation confirmed that this generation of Armenians (in its majority) knows nothing about friendship and the values of it. It was truely shocking NOT to see a single trace of mutual long-lasting connection between any of the subjects. What is a &quot;crew&quot;, members of which are ready to stab each other in the back? Whats the point of an &quot;area group&quot; (koocha-i @ngerutyoon), if it immediatelly rejects a prospective new area member (who is Armenian!), who seems just like them? Finally, what is the future of a 16 year old girl, who doesnt know who to associate with and constantly &quot;bounces&quot; from her black &quot;homeboyz&quot; to the Armenian &quot;homegirlz&quot;, etc - concurrently badmouthing either group (see &quot;Gogo Investigates&quot; section)? <br>
<br>
One thing I am glad about is that with new conduct came new terminology. We dont have to discontinue using words like &quot;friend&quot; or &quot;community&quot;, since they have not changed their meaning (they have a bit, but thats another story). Instead, new words, such as &quot;homeboyz/-girlz&quot; and &quot;crew&quot; have come into the everyday slang. With some thinking and wit, I am sure someone will be able to give a thorough and precise definition to those words. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#272727><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> DonStepanovich</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF0000>(10/30/03 5:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fgogortilozbbsfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Gogo Investigates</span><hr size=1> Yoyo GoGo, Word Life, me haz come up with a plan CuZ Ima Mastermind (taken from Lazy Kings Page).

Aiii, let me know bro. <br>

Only kidding my friend, congratulations on your investigation Gogortiloz. Man, are those guys for reel? Makes me want to chase after them with a cricket bat! That Dsooil Takavor (I think it should be Vor Takavor) thinks he's so hard. He ain't got a cluse of the real world. Same can be said about Snakeeyes, i mean the guy actually thinks that he is a khapshig! Yeah right, unless he is related to Michael Jackson; then he would be a bigger freak than he already is. And Ace of Spades, a modern day khapshig wannabe Armenian with that classic trait of money loving. Forget the baseball bat mate, I'll hit a six on your head with my cricket bat. Hopefully that will knock some sense into him. Anyway, I loved your investigation - couldn't stop laughing. Please keep on investigating as these prats need to be exposed - named and shamed Armenian stlye! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Z</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF0000>(10/30/03 5:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fgogortilozbbsfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ya</span><hr size=1> ive been waiting for you. you are like the joan of arc of the niggerhating armenian community. Ya, i said it, least someone did. Anyone whose ever been in a 5 mile radius of glenoaks and brand boulevard has experienced the precence of a niggerarmenian at one time or another. Your comedic stanpoint and presentation is a very respectable.

Very nice overall design, simple yet effective navigation and best of all, great content. Now about this investigation and your overall position on the new Armenian generation, you have hit the bullseye. Me and my friends have been talking about this exact type of behaviour lately and its been more and more apparent to us as the days go on and its frankly becoming very disturbing to the point when sometimes, you feel ashamed of being an Armenian which in fact makes me feel bad. I am very proud of being an Armenian but when I see this type of behaviour amongst not only the &quot;Rabiz&quot; armenians but the parskahyes as well. It is going out of control and it is disgusting. <br>
<br>
Me and my friends where thinking of creating a website similar to yours which also discussed this type of behaviour but we never got to it because of server related issues. We will eventually do so because I think we need to expose the Armenian youth to this type of behaviour more and maybe just maybe they will begin to change their ways. <br>
<br>
Once again, I would like to congradulate on this great investigation and I support the points you are trying to make. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgogortilozbbs.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lilylikewhoa>Lilylikewhoa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/15/03 1:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fgogortilozbbsfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Gogo Investigates is the beeeeeeeeestttttttt </span><hr size=1> I've gotta say, that was one of the most hilarious things I've ever read. The whole idea of investigating ghetto armenians makes me laugh out loud :) It was so funny to see the response  of that moron who started cursing Don Gogortiloz off haha And then his friend, who turned out to be a complete traitor, trying to be nice to our Don in order to fit in. Wow, morons. Can they get any more pathetic? And don't get me started on that little immature girl. Her parents are stupid for raising such stupid offspring. They should be smacked.
