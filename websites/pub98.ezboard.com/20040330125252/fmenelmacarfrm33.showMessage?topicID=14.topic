Uhm, yeah...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>A Dragon's Life</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no, that's really something for me. The first visitor in ages is a hero.&quot; Ryllanth looked up, bored. A big, heavy-built warrior appeared in the entrance of the cave, a shadow against the bright light of the sun. He had drawn his sword, and the sound of metal told Ryllanth that the warrior wore an armor. He stepped inside and stopped in front of the dragon's head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have come to defeat thee, o dragon&quot;, he said, and more of that kind of nonsense. Ryllanth waited politely until he had finished.<br>
&quot;Good, have you finished? Then let's get over with this quickly, the sooner the better&quot;, she said.<br>
The warrior jumped backwards. He was young and fast, that was something, at least. While the warrior jumped back and forth the dragon waited for the right moment, roasted the guy with a single blast of fire and ate him.<br>
<br>
Ryllanth had just put herself to rest, as she heard the hoof-beats of a horse. Annoyed she looked up.<br>
&quot;Please, not again&quot;, she thought. &quot;For two hundred years nobody comes by, and then two on the same day. Had slaying dragon's come into fashion again?&quot; She heard someone knocking on the wall of the cave. This one was at least polite, something you didn't encounter very often in this millenium.<br>
&quot;Yeah, come in!&quot; shouted the dragon with a voice that sounded as a powerful thunder in the cave, whereupon a young man entered. You could immediately see that this wasn't a warrior. No sturdy pose, no muscles and he didn't even wear an armor, only chain mail under his long green coat. <br>
&quot;Well, what's up?&quot; the dragon said grumpy.<br>
&quot;I..eh...I need your...eh...help&quot;, the young man finally managed to say.<br>
&quot;My help?&quot; Ryllanth was silent for a while. This had never happened before, as long as she could remember, and that was some 5000 years. <br>
&quot;Ehm, yes, you see, it happened thus that, uhm...&quot;, he started carefully, but he was interrupted by the dragon.<br>
&quot;Don't you think you should introduce yourself first, before bothering me with your problems?&quot; Even in the sparse light in the cave Ryllanth could see that the young man was blushing.<br>
&quot;Sorry, my lady&quot;, he said, &quot;My name is Phillip of Parterre&quot;. He bowed elegantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, go on, tell your story. It has been a long time since someone told me a story&quot;, the dragon said melancholy.<br>
&quot;Well, you know, I have a younger brother, Terry. He has been kidnapped in a very rude manner. He has always been such a fine boy. It's not fair.&quot; Phillip was silent for a moment, while his thoughts drifted away to his childhood.<br>
&quot;How did it happen?&quot;, Ryllanth asked.<br>
&quot;Ehm, oh, eh, yes, happened.&quot; Phillip was back in the present again. &quot;Well, we were outside, horse riding. So we traveled along this edge of the forest, when suddenly riders emerged from the forest and blocked the path, it were about three of them. Before we knew what happened they had tied up Terry and had taken him with them. I tried to pursue them, but they were faster. And then I came here and thought 'hey, didn't there live a dragon around here? Perhaps she can help me.' Well, that's why I'm here.&quot;<br>
&quot;And why do you think I would help you?&quot;, Ryllanth asked.<br>
&quot;I don't know. Perhaps you are just a nice dragon.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ha, me? Nice?&quot;, Ryllanth started to laugh which nearly made the cave to collapse. &quot;No, I'm not nice. There has to be something in for me, too.&quot;<br>
&quot;But I don't have anything.&quot; Phillip said. He emptied the pockets of his coat, but all he found was a piece of bread. &quot;This is everything I've got.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hmmm, not much indeed. If you provided me with a tasty meal instead? How did those men that kidnapped your brother look like?&quot;<br>
&quot;Men?&quot;, Phillip turned red. &quot;It..uhm...weren't men.&quot;<br>
&quot;Not men? Then what were they? Trolls? Orcs? Elves? Goblins? Hairy monsters with six legs and three heads? Garden gnomes?&quot;.<br>
&quot;No, no, none of those. It were...women&quot;, Phillip finally admitted. &quot;They were, uhm, lightly dressed, with short skirts and such. And they had flowers with them, and a strong rope. That's why they could surprise us. Because of those flowers and such&quot;, he finished.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kidnapped by ladies?&quot;, Ryllanth was rolling on the floor, laughing. &quot;And you are a prince?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;, Phillip replied.<br>
&quot;Haha, this story is too good. I'm in. And besides that, I have never eaten damsel. Well, what do you think?&quot;, the dragon asked Phillip. &quot;Should they be served with thyme or parsley?&quot;.<br>
Phillip looked up, surprised. &quot;I wouldn't know, o dragon.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hmm, you're not very cooperative. You may call me Ryllanth, by the way. Otherwise I feel so old. And I don't bite, haha&quot;<br>
Phillip could just in time avoid saying &quot;but you are old!&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are by horse?&quot;, Ryllanth asked. Phillip nodded.<br>
&quot;Well, wait outside for a minute, I have to pack a thing or two.&quot;, she said and disappeared somewhere in the darkness of the cave, while Phillip obediently went outside. The prince heard a lot of fumbling and a soft whinnying in the back of the cave. He got curious and looked inside the cave, but he saw nothing. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice from behind him.<br>
&quot;Are you looking for me?&quot;, that voice said. He startled and turned around, and then he startled even more. The dragon sat on an enormous beast. It looked a bit like a horse, except that it was much larger and covered with scales. Phillip stared at it with wide-open eyes and mouth. <br>
&quot;Have you never seen a horse before?&quot;, Ryllanth asked. She patted the beast on its neck. &quot;This is Rund&quot;. The beast answered with snorting and blew a small flame over Ryllanth's paw. &quot;You didn't think I would &lt;I&gt;walk&lt;/I&gt;, did you? Now, what are you waiting for, boy. Let's go&quot;. Ryllanth sniffed and pointed with her paw to the east. &quot;That way&quot;.<br>
<br>
It was a strange sight, the dragon sitting on a horse-like creature. Ryllanth's hind paws were equipped with a kind of shoes, to prevent that the dragon would tear open the sides of the horse. With her fore paws she held the thick stainless-steel reins and with her tail she regularly patted the behind of the beast to spur the beast. But they went fast. Although Rund was calmly trotting, Phillip and his horse had great difficulties to keep up.<br>
<br>
After some time they left the hills behind them and rode along a dense and dark forest, while they were following the trace of the kidnappers. Rund appeared to be a good tracker, and they made good progression. As the sun was setting, they heard some voices.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Guys, this is it! This is the moment we have been waiting for, this is what we have trained for. Finally people travel through this far edge of the country. Sharpen your knives, polish your clubs! We are ready for it. Loot will be our reward, and fame! Ah, I already smell the gold and silver&quot; The chief smelled the air. &quot;Men, fight like real men! Show your courage and we will be infamous, a legend! Everyone will shiver when they hear our name. They will creep away in their houses and huts when they when the rumor spreads: 'The robbers of the Demmerwold are coming!' &quot;. Cheers filled the air.<br>
&quot;Follow me into the battle!&quot;, the chief continued. He raised his sword and wanted to run forwards, but a little man who stood behind him tapped him nervously on his shoulders. <br>
&quot;Uhm, boss? This is a dragon.&quot;<br>
&quot;So?&quot;, the chief replied. &quot;A dragon is just a dragon. We are the undaunted robbers of the Demmerwold! We will become feared and infamous! So, are we afraid of a dragon?&quot;<br>
&quot;No!!!&quot;, the answer resounded through the wood, although not all voices sounded equally convinced.<br>
<br>
The chief stepped out of the bushes and came eye to eye with Rund. The dragon horse looked back with a blank gaze. The robber move looked up and came eye to eye with the dragon.<br>
&quot;Uhm, well, I am&quot;, the chief finished his speech.<br>
&quot;What are you?&quot;, Ryllanth asked with an innocent smile, as far as a dragon was capable of doing that. <br>
&quot;Good evening, o dragon. We were just discussing about the weather. I think the weather is nice. You, too?&quot;, the chief said diplomatically while he shifted his weight nervously from one foot to the other. At that moment, someone from behind shouted:<br>
&quot;Hey, boss, are we going to attack or what?&quot;<br>
The chief nearly got a heart attack, but regained himself quickly.<br>
&quot;Attack? Who wants to attack a dragon?&quot;. He raised his hands desperately into the air. &quot;Excuse us, please, o dragon. I can't help it that I'm stuck with a bunch of imbeciles.&quot;<br>
&quot;Excuses, what can I buy for excuses?&quot;, the dragon said. &quot;What if you chopped some wood for a nice camp fire for tonight? I can light it myself&quot;, Ryllanth added with a smile.<br>
<br>
Mocking the men went on their way, but after a short time they all sat around a warm campfire. <br>
&quot;Did you see a group of damsels this afternoon?&quot;, Philip asked. The chief thought for a moment.<br>
&quot;No, but they may have passed during our siesta.&quot;, he said thoughtful. Then he shouted to his men: &quot;Hey, did you hear that? Next time we have a look out during siesta. I don't want to miss any damsels again!&quot;<br>
<br>
The night went on, the fire burnt low and the men fell asleep, one by one. &quot;They are wussies&quot;, said the chief, who was the last to close his eyes. Philip stayed close to the dragon.<br>
&quot;I don't trust them&quot;, he whispered softly.<br>
&quot;I neither&quot;, the dragon answered. &quot;But that is totally mutual. Sometimes it has some advantages to be a dragon, sometimes it does.&quot;<br>
<br>
The next morning Philip woke up early. He immediately noticed that something was wrong. I looked around with a sleepy head, and took some time before he was awake enough to find out that the dragon was gone. Then he saw a message that was burnt into the grass:<br>
&quot;Good morning, sleepyhead, go home.&quot;, he read. Surprised he looked down the path, but all he saw was a cloud of dust. Or smoke. It was hard to tell the difference with a dragon. Philip shrugged. Ryllanth would know what was best for them. Weren't dragons wise? He carefully stepped over the sleeping men to his horse. <br>
&quot;Ho, Harley, we're going home.&quot;, he said,  and that was what they did.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ha, finally I got rid of him&quot;, Ryllanth sighed while she hurried on Rund through the landscape. &quot;What a Dud was that Philip guy.&quot; Rund could follow the traces easily on his own and the thoughts of Ryllanth went to recipes for damsels. You had to be careful with them, her mother had taught her. Don't grill them too long, otherwise you would end up with nothing but dust. Damsel-on-a-stick was also nice, but you needed a knight with a lance for that; those were rare these days.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Rund came to a halt, in such a way that Ryllanth nearly toppled off. They were facing a large hedge. Ryllanth couldn't look over it to the other side, although she sat on Rund. <br>
&quot;If I cannot get over the top of that hedge, I'll have to go through it&quot;, she thought. She pressed Rund back, they took a run and jumped plump into the hedge. The hedge stood firm and they were launched just as fast backwards. <br>
&quot;I &lt;I&gt;hate&lt;/I&gt; hedges&quot;, Ryllanth grumbled, while she removed a few thorns from between the scales of her horse. She looked again at the hedge and snorted disrespectfully. <br>
&quot;It's only wood. Ho Rund, burn it to the ground&quot;, she said. The horse took a deep breath, spat out a large amount of fire and the hedge was burned to ashes.<br>
&quot;Ha!&quot;, Ryllanth said triumphant. However, before she had finished her words the hedge rose again from its ashes and within a few seconds it was just as high as before.<br>
&quot;Bah, Phoenix bushes. Somebody really wants that I don't get through&quot;. Well, they hadn't taken her into account.<br>
<br>
With a sigh the dismounted from her horse and looked at her claws. Blunt of course. Grrrr. And of course she had forgotten her wet stone. Out of frustration she burned a bit more of the hedge and searched for a suitable stone. With endless patience she sharpened her nails, regularly interrupted  by curses because she had forgotten her real wet stone; Rund nibbled on some flint stones in the mean time. Finally she had finished her job, a sharper could be jealous. Ha, those damn bushes would get a tough time! One more time she looked at the hedge that grimly challenged her, took a deep breath and started to cut the first branches. The wood was tough and the cutting was tiresome, but she proceeded slowly. Centimeter by centimeter the dragon worked her way through the hedge, and after two hours they had made it. Ryllanth looked regretful at her nails. They were ugly: blunt, cracked and covered with green spots. Even Rund had a few green spots on his scales. Well, that had to wait until they were back home. Why did they do this again? Oh yes, damsels.<br>
<br>
The dragon examined the surroundings. In front of her was another hedge, but to her left and  right was a path that went around a corner after a few meters. She followed the path in both directions until the corners. From there she saw junctions and more corners. All paths were flanked by the same high hedges, all Phoenix bushes.<br>
<br>
&quot;A maze!&quot;, Ryllanth thought. She liked mazes, because humans usually got lost but dragons didn't. She tried to remember what she had learned about mazes when she was young, but she didn't really succeed. She was tired, and it was late already. The maze had to wait until tomorrow. She watched how the sun turned the maze ominously red. As the sun had disappeared completely, she put herself to rest after a long day. Ryllanth didn't sleep very well that night, though, because a maze could contain a minotaur. She wasn't afraid of people, but to defend yourself against a minotaur you had to be awake, at least. Time after time she woke up from her sleep: that rushing in the hedge, what was it? She sniffed and decided it was only a mice. The sound of hooves! No, it was just Rund walking around. Ah well, the animal  was smart enough to keep itself from getting lost. Finally she fell asleep.<br>
<br>
When she woke up again, it was already morning. It was a quiet morning though: no rushing of the wind, no whistling and flapping of the birds, only some flies buzzed in the distance. Where was her horse?<br>
&quot;Rund, herrre!&quot;, she called, but Rund didn't come. Curiously she walked down one of the paths of the maze, around the first corner, and...she held her breath. Rund stood quietly next to a minotaur and scraped the sand from the path.<br>
&quot;Rund, come!&quot;, she shouted again. Obediently but not very happy the dragon horse came; the minotaur followed it as a dog.<br>
&quot;What are you doing, you stupid animal&quot;, Ryllanth asked while she patted the horse softly on its nose. The minotaur sat down on his behind and looked at her with begging eyes. Carefully the dragon came closer and patted the minotaur on its nose, too. The minotaur licked her paw.<br>
<br>
&quot;The minotaurs of these days&quot;, Ryllanth thought and shook her head. She jumped on her horse. &quot;Ho, Rund, let's crack a maze&quot;, she exclaimed exuberantly, while Rund whinnied. The minotaur walked away, but the horse followed the creature. Where was the darn beast going? Ah, well, it only was a maze, and it didn't matter from which point you started to solve the maze, thus they followed the minotaur turn after turn and crossing after crossing.  Finally they arrived at a large open space in the center of the maze. The open space wasn't completely empty, though: in the middle stood a dreary stone tower of approximately twenty meters high. Just below the roof were a few small and dark windows. Ryllanth patted the minotaur once again on its nose.<br>
&quot;You're a good boy. Let me see if I have something for you.&quot;, she rummaged through Rund's saddle-bag and found some dried human meat.<br>
&quot;Mmm, human meat. Roasted it myself&quot;, she said and held it in front of the nose of the minotaur. The minotaur jumped for it and disappeared in the maze, wagging with its tail. <br>
<br>
Ryllanth shook her head and put her attention to the tower. It seemed like a good hiding place for robbers, barbarians or other scum. Only the strong smell of alcohol and the noise that seemed to come out of the building didn't match with that image. Curiously she dismounted and walked around the tower. On the other side of the tower, was another exit of the maze. There was also a large signboard.<br>
&quot;Inn in the Maze&quot;, it said. Ryllanth looked up and guessed that a stay in this inn wouldn't be very pleasant. She tied Rund to the poles that were available for that purpose and entered the barroom.  The barroom was a dark, half round space. The only light came through the now open door and from a few lonely candles along the wall. The other half of the tower would probably be occupied by the kitchen or private rooms. Next to the door was a small wooden stair leading up.<br>
<br>
Ryllanth absorbed the company in the inn. At a table in the front three trolls were counting their collection of stones at a table in the front. Now and then she heard some approving grunt when one of them showed a extraordinary specimen. A bit further were a human, an elf and a dwarf drinking a pot of beer. Regarding the current state of the human, they were sitting here for quite some time already; the elf and the dwarf didn't seem to have any problems. Humans cannot stand anything. The human didn't look like a prince, so most likely he wasn't one. Humans were easy that way. At the table next to them a gryphon was stared dreary at the wall, while he took now and then a sip from a bowl of water. With a body like this you feel down automatically, Ryllanth thought. In a far corner were three sphinxes exchanging the last riddles. As the dragon entered and darkened the entrance, they all looked up, except for the human, who wasn't able to do so anymore. Ryllanth quenched her big body behind a table close to the tap, and all visitors went on with what they were doing.<br>
<br>
One of the servant girls came to Ryllanth's table to take the order, and suddenly the dragon understood a lot. She didn't know much about humans, but she did understand why this girl would have to kidnap princes. She also understood the why the human on the other table was drunk. She even understood why the robbers of the Demmerwold were having their siesta when the girls had passed. Because even the dragon noticed that the damsels were extremely ugly. They were wearing sportswear, as humans called it according to her when they didn't wear much clothing, but it would have been better if the damsels were wearing more.<br>
<br>
When Ryllanth got her bowl of firewater, she asked innocently, &quot;Say, did you see a prince in  her some time ago?&quot;<br>
&quot;No&quot;, the servant answered snappy and walked over to her colleague behind the tap. Ryllanth saw how they whispered to each other, and she saw how one of them disappeared through a door. Then she heard how some one went down a staircase. She emptied the bowl at one draught, puffed a few clouds of smoke and followed the damsel.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, you can't get in there!&quot;, one of the ladies exclaimed with a horrible piercing voice.<br>
&quot;No?&quot;, Ryllanth asked. She grinned and showed her teeth, while she inhaled deeply.<br>
&quot;Uhm, no, actually not. Private, you know. Besides, it's too small for someone of your body size.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, we'll find out about that last thing.&quot; The dragon looked with disapproval at the far too meager damsel. If the dragon had wanted to, she could have counted the damsels' bones. &quot;At least there's nothing wrong with my body size.&quot;, Ryllanth said. The damsel returned a deadly glance and stepped challenging in front of the door. She may have been brave, but not very smart. The dragon pushed her roughly away from the door, which caused the damsel to break in half, and she burned the door. Some of the guest looked up for a moment, but nobody really seemed to care. Ryllanth squeezed herself through the open door and carefully went down the spiraling staircase. It was a bit small indeed, sometimes her little wings almost got stuck. But only almost<br>
<br>
Ryllanth proceeded surly, while the air became sultry. Step by step she went down, until she arrived in a large basement. The air was moist and smelled of soap and mildew. The only light came from a small opening somewhere upstairs and illuminated a large basin. Furthermore, Ryllanth saw stacks of dirty dishes, clothes and other stuffed that had to get cleaned. Next to the basin she saw a few clean things, that apparently had just been done. She turned her head and could just determine in a far corner some belts, lashes, wrenches and other obscure equipment. And a women who held a glowing metal rod. <br>
<br>
The woman leapt forward with the rod, but Ryllanth could duck in time and the rod hit the wall with a loud 'bang'.<br>
&quot;Where is he?&quot;, Ryllanth asked. The damsel said nothing and did strike once again. This time the dragon could cover her face only with her paw, which caused her a large bruise and some burnt scales.<br>
&quot;Ai, you hurt me.&quot;, she said. The damsels laughed triumphant, but too soon. One flame later the women was a stick of sate. Ryllanth sniffed for a moment. Leek, that was what she needed, she could have known.<br>
<br>
And now? Wait, didn't she hear anything? She looked in the direction of the sound. At first she saw nothing and crawled closer until she hit her nose at a wooden door. The sound stopped, but Ryllanth decided to take a look anyway. She cracked the door and looked into a small room. In a corner was the third damsel leaning over someone, she turned around and as she saw the dragon, she shrieked a dashed up the stairs. Ryllanth pursued. Stair ended in a hallway with a door leading outside. When the dragon had managed to get through the opening, she just saw the damsel disappear with big leaps into the maze.<br>
<br>
The dragon shrugged and turned around and saw a prince standing in the door. He looked good for a human!<br>
&quot;You are Terry?&quot;, Ryllanth asked. The prince nodded. &quot;Your brother Philip sent me. I am Ryllanth.&quot;, the dragon said.<br>
&quot;You saved me, didn't you?&quot;, Terry asked. He walked somewhat shy to the dragon, put an arm around her huge neck and kissed her on the nose.<br>
&quot;Thank you&quot;, he said softly. Together they entered the inn, and they lived long and happily ever after.<br>
