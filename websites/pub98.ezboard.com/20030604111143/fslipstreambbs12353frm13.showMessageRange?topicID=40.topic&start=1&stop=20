<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka walked into the room she’d discovered as Harper’s new quarters. The room was large and bare, except for the beige bed against the far wall. Looking around, Beka would’ve believed she was in one of the ship’s many machine shops she’d seen while walking down the deck. She knew that, in no time, the room would be filled with dozens of Harper’s little projects. She was glad that now he had the freedom to create all of the little knickknacks he used to babble on about. The Maru didn’t exactly allow for experimentation. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, Boss, ya wanna move so I can get in?” asked Harper. She hadn’t heard him walk in. He was carrying a large box filled with his stuff from the Maru. She saw one of his many brightly colored Hawaiian shirts draping over the side. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Sorry, Harper,” she said, stepping aside. Grinning, he walked in, setting the box down on the floor. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Found your own place yet?” he asked, beginning to sort through the junk in the box. Beka had never noticed before, but now it was painfully obvious how little Harper really had. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka shrugged, still looking around the room. “The rooms on Deck 15 are nice. They probably belonged to the old officers. Though they’re not as spacious as this.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, cool, isn’t it? Rommie told me her old engineer used to live in a room like this,” Harper said, hardly able to contain the excitement in his voice. Beka had never seen him so happy before, like he’d found a new toy to play with. “Now I can work and sleep in the same place.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Rommie, huh?” Beka said, raising an eyebrow. “You two on a first name basis?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s not like she has a last name, Beka,” he said, looking away sheepishly. She swore she saw him blush. “Besides, we might as well get to know her. We will be staying for a while.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, I guess we are,” Beka said, sighing as she sat on Harper’s bed. Harper stopped sorting through his things. Being together for so long, he’d developed a sixth sense about Beka’s moods and feelings. He sat next to her, leaning his elbows on his knees. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You’re not so sure about this, are you?” he said, more as a statement then a question. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No, I’m not,” she said. “I mean, restoring the Commonwealth? Come on, who does he think he is?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Captain Dylan Hunt of the High Guard?” Harper said. Beka glared at her engineer. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Thank you, Harper.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Don’t mention it,” he said. “Look, he said we’re free to go at any time. Give it a chance, Bek. What’s the worst that could happen?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Do you really have to ask?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Okay, since I happen to be just as suspicious and paranoid as you, here’s what I’m gonna do. You know those override codes I installed in Andromeda’s system so we could take over the ship?<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, I have to erase them so that Dylan had complete control of the ship.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Great, then he’ll have all the power over us. He’ll have us bowing to his every whim and fancy,” Beka said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Would you calm down? Anyway, because I don’t totally trust the guy, I’ll only erase a few of the codes. That way, if he goes all psycho on us, we can get away free and easy,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You’d do that?” she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Beka, I’m always working for you. Just ‘cause we’re Dylan’s new crew doesn’t change that. Any time you wanna go, just say the word and I’ll be with you,” he said, smiling. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I couldn’t imagine leaving without you,” she said, placing an arm around his shoulders, giving him a tight squeeze. “Wanna come find me a room?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Sure! I’m almost done unpacking anyway,” he said, laughing. Beka laughed along with him. They left the practically empty room, ready to face the coming adventure; together. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>To Loose the Fateful Lightning:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You made an android?” Beka asked, steering the Maru toward the escape pods floating around. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I needed something to do,” Harper said, standing next to the pilot’s chair.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“And you thought making a woman was the best way to pass the time?” she asked. Harper frowned. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What’re you getting at, Beka?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What were you expecting when you made her?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper paused. “Nothing.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Nothing? You mean you didn’t expect Rommie to be grateful for having an avatar and wanting to show you her appreciation?” she asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No,” Harper lied.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Okay, okay, maybe it was for me! So sue me!” he shouted. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Don’t get angry at me for this. You’re the one setting yourself up for rejection,” Beka countered, her voice remaining calm.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harper grumbled. Beka turned to face him, seeing the hurt already in his eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper, I just don’t want you to get hurt,” she said, touching his arm. “I know she’s sentient now, but that doesn’t make her anymore available.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I know what I’m doing, Beka,” he said. She smiled sadly. Harper had already fallen hopelessly in love with Andromeda and there was nothing she could do to protect him. She turned back to the controls.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, I know you do.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>D-Minus Zero:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka entered the med-deck after her conversation with Dylan. Harper lay on the bed, a blanket draped over him courtesy of Trance after he’d fallen asleep. He still looked like hell. His skin was sickly and pale and she could see a slight tremor in his body appear sporadically. Trance was saying nothing but good things about his recovery, but Beka always over worried when it came to Harper. She slid a chair over to the bed. Without saying a word, Harper’s eyes fluttered open. He looked at Beka, his eyes partially glazed over from sleep. When his focus came back, Harper smiled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, Boss,” he said, recalling a similar beginning to a conversation with Dylan.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey,” she said. “How do you feel?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Like crap, but that’s better than I felt an hour ago,” he said. She saw his smile fade. Guilt set into his face. “I’m sorry, Beka.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“For what?” she asked, already knowing the reason.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I shouldn’t have made the FMS. Dylan wouldn’t have been able to—” he started. Beka placed a finger over his mouth, stopping him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Shut up,” she said. Taking her finger away, Harper stayed quiet. “You did your job, Harper. And if you hadn’t made the FMS, I don’t think any of us would be here right now.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“But, Dylan—”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Dylan was trying to save us and I was being stupid. You didn’t do anything wrong,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I would’ve gone with you,” he whispered. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I know,” she said, ruffling his hair. She could see that the conversation was tiring him. She began to slowly stroke his hair, humming gently. “Go to sleep, Harper. You’ve had a long day.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Okay,” he said, his voice trailing off. She watched his eyes close and his breathing even out into a slow, calm rhythm. He was asleep. She stayed by his side until he woke up the next morning.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Andromeda, where’s Harper?” Beka asked. Andromeda’s hologram appeared in front of the First Officer. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper is in his quarters,” she said tersely.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Still mad at him?” Beka asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“A little,” Andromeda, replied, the edge in her voice somewhat softened. “I know why he did it. I just don’t like that he could.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“He won’t do it again,” Beka said, knowing Harper well enough to know that he wouldn’t. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Is that a promise?” Andromeda asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka shrugged. “Let’s say it’s intuition.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I can live with that,” Andromeda said. Beka smiled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Do you know what Harper’s doing?” Beka asked. She hadn’t seen the engineer since they’d returned from Witchhead Nebula, 300 years in the past.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Andromeda shook her head. “He engaged privacy mode immediately.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I don’t like that,” Beka said, racing down the corridor past Andromeda. Her hologram flickered out of sight, though she couldn’t hide the worry from her face.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka ran up to Harper’s door. She pressed the bell, but the door didn’t open. She knocked on the door several times, but still the door didn’t open.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper, it’s Beka! Let me in!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I could help you, Beka,” Andromeda said, appearing next to the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Andromeda, door override; Alpha, six, niner.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Andromeda nodded. “Authorization accepted. Acting First Officer, Beka Valentine.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
The door opened. Beka stepped inside. The room was dimly lit, but she could clearly see Harper sitting on his bed, leaning against the wall. He was staring ahead, looking at nothing. He didn’t acknowledge her presence when she entered. She sat on the bed, sliding closer to him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I wanna leave, Beka,” he said, his eyes still staring ahead.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Why?” she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Why?” he repeated in disgust, finally looking at her. “I’m a murderer!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper—”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I killed thousands of people! I-I can’t stay here!” he shouted. He settled back down, taking deep breaths. “It wasn’t supposed to feel like this.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What was it supposed to feel like?” she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Like…we’d won. Like…I’d finally gotten back at all those Ubers for what they did,” he whispered. She put her arms around him. He put his hands on her arms, keeping hold of her, afraid to let go.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I’m sorry,” she said, leaning her head against his. “I wish I could take it all away.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t have it,” he said. She heard him sniffle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’ll get better,” she said. “You just have to give it time.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Time on the Andromeda?” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“If you really wanna go, then we’ll go,” she said. Harper let go of her arms. He twisted his body so he could look at her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No, I don’t wanna go,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka smiled. “I didn’t think so.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He stared at her, sadness still evident in his face. “Rommie hates me.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Oh, Harper,” she said, hugging him, “you lovesick little boy. Rommie doesn’t hate you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Says you,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Like I said previously, just give it some time,” she said, making sure her arms were securely around him. Andromeda watched the two crew members hold each other. She could see the misery in Harper’s face and no longer had the heart to stay mad at him.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper entered the Maru, holding the golden trophy in his hand. He shined it with the sleeve of his shirt, smiling proudly when he saw his reflection. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, Harper,” Beka said, meeting him at the bar. She gave him a pat on the back before pulling out a bottle of beer for him. He took it gratefully, snapping the cap off and taking a big swig. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey yourself,” he said. He placed the trophy on the bar, showing it off to Beka. She’d been the one to show him Infinity Atoll and got him into surfing when all he’d been interested in was fixing the Maru. She looked at the inscription on the bottom.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Seamus Harper. 20th Place, Pan Galactic Surfing Championship. Congratulations, Harper,” she said, getting some coffee for herself. His smile grew wider. “Last I’d seen, you were in 48th.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I got some really great waves,” he said. He looked down at the bar, tracing the edge with his finger. He was about to say something. “I hear Rafe stopped by.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka sighed. “Bastard stole my disks. All of them!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper burst out laughing. Beka tried to keep a solemn face, but couldn’t help laughing along with her engineer. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Definitely sounds like Rafe,” Harper said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I can’t believe how long it’s been since I’d last seen him, ya know?” she said, becoming reflective. It was a rare moment for Beka. Images of her childhood flashed before her eyes. “I didn’t realize how much I missed him.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Funny how that works,” Harper said. “People we love come and go. Some you expect to see again, others you don’t. Doesn’t make it any easier when they leave, but you feel a whole lot better when you see them again.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You weren’t by chance hanging out with any of the Wayists on Infinity, were you?” Beka asked, chuckling at his insight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, I have my moments,” he said. “But I also know what it’s like to lose family. I had some cousins who’d get on my nerves. They were so annoying sometimes, but now…I’d give anything to see them again.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“That’ll never happen to us,” she said, placing her hand over his. He gave a feeble smile, but no one, not even Beka, could convince Harper that he was safe from the horrors he’d seen as a child. As much and as often as she told him they’d never be separated, there was always a saddened glint in his eyes that he knew nothing would ever last. It was a constant worry of Harper’s that one day she’d change her mind and leave him on a drift somewhere and never look back. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, I guess so,” he said, taking another swig of beer. Beka smiled contentedly. Life wasn’t so bad on the Andromeda. They were doing some good by restoring the Commonwealth and she had her friends with her. And with Harper, she had her family. She finally saw how much of a brother the little mudfoot from Earth had become. Even more so than Rafe.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“So, where ya gonna put the trophy?” she asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper shrugged. “I don’t know. Maybe in the crew’s quarters next to my bunk,” he said. Beka fingered the trophy, smiling proudly at Harper again. His ego boosted even more, he showed all of his teeth when he returned the smile.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I know where we can put this,” she said. She picked up the trophy and headed to the cockpit. She placed the trophy under the many postcards she’d collected in the ten years she’d piloted the Maru. She stepped back, practically knocking Harper over. They steadied each other and gazed at the trophy’s new home on the Maru.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It looks good there,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I couldn’t agree more.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Banks of the Lethe:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
She found him in the machine shop, frantically punching numbers into a console. On a plasma screen nearby, she saw several simulations being run. They were light years away from the black hole and he was still trying to figure out what went wrong. It was an inquiry that seemed to be turning into an obsession for the little engineer. He’d been losing sleep and was hardly seen anywhere else then in the shop. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper,” she said, cutting through the hum of the machines. He jumped. He normally never jumped when Beka called. She was careful to keep her voice low around him. It showed just how wrapped up in this he really was.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, Boss,” he said, finishing the sequence of numbers. An angry alarm sounded. He hit the console in frustration. “Stupid piece of junk!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, save it for the gym, Rocky,” she said, using one of his own ancient Earth references. He smiled, but cradled his hand. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I don’t understand, Beka. It shoulda worked. Sarah shoulda been here,” he said. She noted the tinge of sadness in his voice. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, she’s not, Harper. So stop beating yourself up over it,” Beka said. “It was just meant to be that way.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Don’t tell me you’ve become a fatalist, Boss,” Harper said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No, I’m a realist. And I thought you were too,” she said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I just know it shoulda worked,” Harper said. “Maybe…maybe if we go back to Sinti, then I could talk more with Hohne and…”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper, is all this about not making the machine work?” she asked. He stared at the plasma screen running his simulations. All of them failed. His gaze lowered, revealing his self anger.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“300 years, Beka. He was frozen for 300 years. And he had a chance to be happy and…” his voice trailed off from there. Nothing more had to be said for Beka to figure out what was really troubling the engineer. She put a hand on his shoulder.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“And you couldn’t make that happen,” she finished. Harper nodded. “Harper, Dylan doesn’t blame you for not being able to bring Sarah here. And he doesn’t think any less of you as an engineer. You are still a genius.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, well, a genius woulda found a way to make that thing work,” Harper seethed, pointing at the transporter. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“And one day you will,” she said. He looked at her, searching her face. For what, she wasn’t quite sure.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“How can you have so much faith in me?” he asked, genuinely curious. Beka chuckled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Because you’re Seamus Zelazny Harper, super genius-ah!” she said, mimicking his own voice. Harper laughed. “Okay?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Okay,” he said, sounding happier. He looked over at the transporter and sighed. “I’m not gonna be able to work with that thing staring back at me all the time. You wanna help me take this thing apart?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Why?” she asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Spare parts. Some of the circuitry could go well with Rommie’s programming,” he said. “Besides, I’ve got the schematics down on a flexi already. I can rebuild at any time.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Then let’s get to work,” Beka said. <br>

“So, no confessions today?” Beka laughed as she entered the Command Deck and found Harper repairing one of the officer’s stations. Trance was working at her post. She slightly smiled. Harper didn’t answer. He made no snide remark or even gave a reaction. He just continued working. Beka frowned. She walked over to Harper and leaned against the station he was working at.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What, Beka?” he asked, his voice quick to anger. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Sorry, am I bothering you or something?” she asked defensively. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, you are,” he answered, his tone short and snappish. He seemed surprised himself at how mean he sounded. He sighed, waving his hands in the air as he walked out of Command. Beka looked to Trance for an explanation. The purple girl shrugged in confusion. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“He was fine a few minutes ago. We were joking and laughing,” Trance said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Until I came in,” Beka sighed. Trance looked confused again but Beka didn’t bother to explain. She ran out of Command. Harper was a ways down the corridor, but she caught up to him quickly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper!” she called. He stopped and turned to face her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I’m sorry, okay?” he said. He turned away to continue walking away, but she caught his arm, pulling him back. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Not so fast!” she said. He sighed in defeat and stopped again. “Now what was that all about? I was just teasing.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well maybe I don’t think it was so funny,” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Why? Because of Rommie?” she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s nothing I wouldn’t have done for you or Trance. I’d rather die than see one of you hurt,” he said, his voice solid and stern. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I know you would, Harper, and it’s one of the reasons I love you so much,” she said. He smiled. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You’re not gonna get all mushy on me, are ya, Boss?” he asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Not my style,” she said. “But I understand why you did it, Harper. Your heart’s always in the right place, though I can’t say the same for your head.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Thanks, Boss,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No problem,” she said. “So, what were you expecting Dylan to do after you confessed?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Honestly? I hadn’t thought that far ahead,” he admitted. Beka shook her head, chuckling softly. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Typical.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Pearls That Were His Eyes:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper walked into the Observation Deck. He saw Beka and Trance looking out at the stars, Trance’s tail draped over Beka’s shoulder. He thought it was a precious moment and didn’t want to disturb them. Unfortunately, he didn’t see the plant by the door. In his attempt to leave, he knocked into the plant. Dirt spilled on to the floor and the ceramic vase broke, making a loud crashing sound. Harper winced, his cheeks turning bright red when he saw Beka and Trance looking at him. Both were smiling.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Come on, Harper,” Beka said. Harper sulked, walking over to them with his head lowered in embarrassment. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Sorry, Trance,” he said, glancing at her. She smiled sweetly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s okay, Harper. I’ll go get a Maria bot to clean it up,” she said. She unwrapped her tail from Beka and skipped away.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“So, how was Uncle Skid?” Harper asked. He always managed to come up with weird nicknames for people. Even people he didn’t know.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“He was…fine. Just fine,” Beka said. She knew she’d made a mistake. Anyone could tell she was lying. In a way, she wanted Harper to know the truth.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Beka, could you be anymore obvious? Come on, what happened?” he asked. She could see the concern in his eyes. It was touching to know that he really cared about her. Something she couldn’t say for a lot of other people. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“He – um- he forced me to take flash,” she said. Harper’s eyes widened. She saw fire in his eyes. “He was after some data stored in the nanobots in my hair from my father. Then, he tried to kill me.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper gritted his teeth. His fists clenched tightly. “I’ll kill him. Tell me where he is and I’ll shoot the bastard.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper, Harper, calm down! I’m fine, see? Everything’s good,” she said, grabbing him by the shoulders. There was such determination in his eyes, so much anger, that she almost felt like telling him where Sid was. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Flash? Beka, flash? I mean, come on, your dad was a flash addict! And he – he used it on you!” Harper said through his teeth.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I’m okay. No harm done,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What?” he squeaked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Okay, some harm done. But the point is, I’m home and I’m safe,” she said. Harper’s gaze softened. She waited until he nodded in agreement before letting go of his shoulders. She still wasn’t sure whether or not he’d go after Sid. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Do me a favor?” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Sure.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Next time one of your relatives shows up or sends you a note, make sure I’m there,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka smiled. “I think that’s doable.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mathematics of Tears:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Why do people always wanna kill me?” Harper asked. He and Beka were walking to the Mess Hall after their escapade with the Pax Magellanic. For some reason, almost getting killed made them both hungry. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I don’t know, Harper. Maybe it’s your sparkling personality,” Beka joked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I’m serous. I mean, it’s not like I go outta my way to offend people,” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“They weren’t trying to kill us because of you,” Beka said. “They were just trying to kill us. You were a bonus.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Ha! Ha!” Harper said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, it’s not all about you all the time,” she said, laughing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Oh, and I thought the universe did revolve around me,” Harper laughed. Beka put her arm around his neck like an older sibling. She felt him slip his arm around her waist.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I will say one thing. You did a good job defending Dylan and Rommie,” she said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Just doing my job,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Defending people you hardly know? That’s a new one for Seamus Harper,” she said. Harper grinned. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It seems…different, ya know?” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Like ‘higher purpose’ different?” Beka asked. Harper ran his free hand through his hair. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Man, I’ve been hanging around Rev too long,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I guess we’ll have to go outfit you in a red robe and medallion,” Beka said, hugging him as she laughed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, I happen to find red a very flattering color,” Harper said, grinning widely, showing his teeth. The playful sparkle in his eyes drew her in and she laughed from the gut. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
They reached the Mess Hall. Harper heard is stomach growl in anticipation of being fed. He pat his gut, telling it to shush and that it would be full soon.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s got a mind of its own,” he said, proudly patting his stomach.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Come on, I’m in the mood for Italian,” Beka said, leading him inside.<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper was staring at the holographic image of the X-1 on a tiny vid-screen next to the unfinished product. Beka watched his face contort from surprise to confusion in a matter of seconds. He picked up his nano welder and walked up to the giant hunk of metal. He stood there for a moment, contemplating his next move. He always liked to be five steps ahead of himself when working on a project. She saw him frown and shake his head. He put the nano welder down and stared at the vid-screen again. Beka saw it as her cue to step in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s not gonna put itself together,” she said, leaning against the wall.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I thought I’d try telekinesis. See if the pieces just fall into place,” he said, half smiling. Lines of frustration creased his forehead. “Maybe I’ll go talk to Trance and ask her if she knows anything about this thing.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, Trance would be the one to talk to about mysterious things,” Beka agreed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Uh-huh. At least she might know something. Everybody knows something…except me,” Harper said quietly. It wasn’t quiet enough. Beka stared hard at her friend. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Now that’s not true,” she said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Beka, for one very brief second…I knew everything. Everything in the whole universe!” he said, his voice elevated.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“And it almost killed you,” she added.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“A minor detail,” Harper said, shrugging.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“So, you want the ASU back in your head? You wanna have terrible nightmares that keep you from sleeping? You wanna kill Rev?” she asked, her tone intensifying with each question. Harper backed away. He lowered his eyes in shame. Beka almost regretted using a guilt trip on him, but sometimes it was her only option.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No, I don’t want that,” he whispered. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Then what do you want, Seamus?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I coulda fixed the entire ship! Rommie woulda been the baddest starship in the known galaxies!” he yelled. Beka sighed and stepped towards him. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper, for someone so smart, you sure can be dumb,” she said, rubbing the bridge of her nose.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Do you think I know anything about rewiring computers? Do you think Dylan or Tyr could fix the slipstream drive as quickly as you can? Or build an android?” she asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper shook his head. “No.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Then there’s your answer. You are still and always will be a valuable member of this crew,” she said. His lips curled into a slight smile. “And if Dylan doesn’t see that, then he’s blind. Besides, you’re valuable to me and that’s what’s important.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Thanks, Boss,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, what’re bosses for? But there is one thing I need to talk to you about,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“If you ever take my ship again, I’ll use your head as a basketball,” she threatened. Harper nodded quickly, knowing part of the threat was true. But he found it impossible to keep his face serious. He started giggling, which turned into a deep laugh. Beka feigned frustration, which only made him laugh harder. She finally joined him. When they stopped laughing and had calmed down, she noticed him staring at her intensely. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What?” she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He smiled, his eyes glittering. “You really are beautiful.”<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper was still in the Maru after he and Trance had arrived back on the Andromeda. Trance was quick to go find Beka and show her the diary they’d found. With any luck, they’d be heading to Tarn Vedra within the next few days. He was sitting in the pilot’s chair, sipping another Sparky and staring out the window into the hanger. He heard Beka enter the tiny freighter, her footsteps treading lightly on the deck plating. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Quite an adventure you two had,” Beka said, showing Harper the diary. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Wasn’t exactly how I saw our good will mission going,” Harper said, taking another sip of the cola. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, Trance told me everything,” Beka said. Harper gulped.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“How much of everything?” he asked. Beka smiled wryly, raising an eyebrow.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Oh, everything, everything,” she said. “From the part where you protected her from Gerentex to the part where she threatened to kill you both.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper smiled, remembering the whole adventure vividly. “Yeah, she stopped me from doing something crazy.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Define crazy. Because, according to Trance, you did some pretty crazy things,” she said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You know what I mean,” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“She also told me she’d never seen you so ‘mean’ before,” Beka said. Harper fingered the control sticks. Beka waited. He usually answered when he felt ready. After hearing the things Trance told her he’d said, she was more than curious as to how the engineer was doing mentally. Out of all the members of the crew, he was the one most likely to revert back to his old ways of survival when things got tough. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I didn’t mean to act that way,” he said. “Gerentex, he…he made me so mad. He was hurting Trance!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“She told me. She said you were very brave,” Beka said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper’s ears perked up. His smile grew. “She did?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Uh-huh.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“She was pretty brave herself,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You’re changing the subject,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What was the subject?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Ah, come on, Boss, we both know I’m not that interesting.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I know you’ve lived a hard life.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No harder than anyone else’s,” he said, his eyes looking anywhere but at her. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“That’s bull and you know it,” she said. She took his chin between her thumb and index finger, gently forcing him to look her in the eyes. In a matter of seconds, she saw his eyes change from overly confident engineer to haunted mudfoot. Only Harper could pull off such a change. He managed to look older and younger at the same time. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I kept thinking of Earth and all the Ubers who thought they could push me around. Gerentex thought he could just use me and Trance to get what he wanted, and…” he cut himself off, searching for understanding.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Don’t worry, I woulda done the same thing in your shoes,” she said, smiling sympathetically. Harper returned the smile. He took another sip of his Sparky, but there was nothing left. He shook the can in disappointment.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“All out,” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“We’ll have to restock. And try to pick up after yourself. Rommie’s tired of sweeping up Sparky cans in the machine shops,” Beka said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, the machine shops are my territory. I’ll clean it when I’m good and ready,” Harper said, following her out of the Maru. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You tell that to Rommie.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I think I’d rather not.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“That’s what I thought,” she said. She noticed he was frowning. “What’s wrong?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I still didn’t get my 84 grand!”<br>
<br>
Beka laughed, putting her arm around the engineer's shoulders. &quot;Harper, I think we're a bit beyond cash settlements at this point, don't ya think?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harper sighed defeatedly. &quot;Yeah, I guess you're right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Besides, if this thing is real, we'll have more thrones spilling out of our pockets then we know what to do with,&quot; Beka said, thumbing the pages of the diary.<br>
<br>
&quot;You gonna tell Dylan about it?&quot; Harper asked. Beka thought for a moment, considering her options. Maybe showing Dylan wouldn't be so bad.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll think about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Star Crossed:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“He’s been idling in the machine shop for two days, Beka. He won’t speak to me or my avatar,” Andromeda said, trying to remain calm. Beka listened intently, arms crossed over her chest, though she felt like she was betraying Harper by even hearing the ship out.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Andromeda, Harper’s gonna do what Harper’s gonna do,” Beka said. Andromeda frowned, imitating Beka’s stance. The hologram wasn’t backing down. Beka sighed. “But I’ll talk to him.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Thank you,” Andromeda said, flickering out of sight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka stomped all the way to the machine shop Harper was occupying at the moment. He was fiddling around with several small parts. On the work bench were stacks of logic chips he’d scrounged a while back. He carefully took a logic chip and ran a laser scanner over it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“How is it that one person can annoy an A.I. so easily and so often?” Beka asked. He glanced at her but didn’t give his usual bright smile. She sat down across from him, watching him work silently until he became uncomfortable. Harper didn’t like to be watched so intensely.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I haven’t done anything,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“That’s the problem. Andomeda asked me to talk to you since you aren’t talking to her or Rommie,” Beka said. Harper picked up another logic chip.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Why should she care if I talk to her or not?” Harper asked. Andromeda appeared next to Harper.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Because you’re my engineer and a member of my crew,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Privacy mode,” Harper said coldly. Andromeda frowned and blinked out. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Not exactly polite today, are we?” Beka asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, I’m just showing her the same consideration she’s shown me since we met,” Harper said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Aha!” Beka exclaimed. “So, that’s what this is all about.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said, turning back to the logic chips. His eyes darted back to her. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Gabriel,” she said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What about the psycho?” Harper asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I know you were jealous.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No, I wasn’t.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Liar.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Okay, so I was jealous. Sue me,” he said, his tone becoming angry. “Ya know, I work my ass off keeping her running at full capacity. I could cut a few corners and do a half way job, but I don’t. And do I get any thanks? Any appreciation? No! I get squat! And worst of all…!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah?” she said, egging him on so he could clear his chest. This had obviously been building since day one. Harper wasn’t one to speak out when people were mistreating him. It was a rare moment when he actually vented his anger and Beka wasn’t about to let him stop. But the anger seemed to leave him. His shoulders sagged. He put his elbows on the work bench, putting his head in his hands.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Worst of all…I was so easily dismissed,” he said, the sadness showing prominently in his voice and face. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“She was in love with him,” Beka said, trying to be partial. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, well love doesn’t mean ignoring everyone else. Especially people who try to help you,” he said. Beka watched him go back to work on the logic chips. She picked one up, examining it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Whatcha doing?” she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Eliminating glitches in the logic chips before I insert them into Andromeda’s program. I don’t want her pulling a Gabriel or a Pax on us,” he said, taking Beka’s chip. She leaned in closer, their noses practically touching. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“How much longer are you gonna be mad?” she asked. He paused in thought, thinking out the answer. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Gimme another day,” he said. Beka ruffled his hair affectionately. He finally smiled and went back to work.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka walked a few feet down the corridor away from the machine shop before she stopped. Andromeda appeared, her face conveying her guilt. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I had no idea,” she said. Beka crossed her arms.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper’s sensitive, but he doesn’t let it show very often,” she said tersely. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I’m sorry,” Andromeda said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Don’t apologize to me,” Beka said. Andromeda nodded and disappeared. Beka walked away, hoping not to talk to Andromeda for the rest of the day.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>It Makes a Lovely Light:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
When Beka opened her eyes again, she wasn’t surprised to see Trance staring down at her, smiling. The first thing she felt was guilt over what she’d done to her crew. Trance saw the change in her face and smiled more sympathetically. She touched Beka’s arm.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s okay. I forgave you already,” she said. Beka attempted a smile, though she didn’t feel any better. Trance wasn’t one to hold a grudge.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You people are so forgiving,” Beka said. “How long have I been out?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Two days. I gave you a sedative after your conversation with Dylan,” she said. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Can’t imagine I’ve had any visitors since,” Beka said, trying to make a joke, though her voice fell flat. Trance smiled again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I wouldn’t say that,” she said. Following Trance’s eyes, Beka looked to the other side of her bed. Harper was slumped in a chair, sleeping. On the floor were several discarded cans of Sparky cola and three flexis lay in his lap, ready to fall and join the cans on the floor. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“How long?” Beka asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“He hasn’t left since you’ve been asleep. He’s been directing all the repairs to the ship from that chair,” Trance explained. Beka smiled. It was the first smile that actually felt genuine. She wanted nothing more than to hug the sleeping engineer. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He stirred, letting out a tired groan. Beka felt the sudden urge to close her eyes and pretend she was asleep. Remembering what she’d said to him, she wasn’t sure what kind of reception she’d receive from her friend, if she could even call him that anymore. He opened his eyes. Blinking out the blurriness in his eyes, he looked right at her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, Boss,” he said. She couldn’t hear a trace of anger in his voice, just relief.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey. How’re you doing?” she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He snorted. “I thought I was supposed to ask that question,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Old habits die hard,” she said. Beka looked at Trance. “Trance, could you give us a few minutes alone, please?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Take all the time you need,” she said, walking away from the bed, her smile still bright and cheery. There was a moment of uncomfortable silence between the captain and the engineer. Harper looked ready to run despite his initial happy demeanor when he’d woken up. Maybe she should have had Trance stay. He seemed more comfortable with her in the room. Beka pushed herself up in the bed. Harper watched her every move.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper, I…I want to apologize for what I said to you,” she said, though she stared at the sheets. She was afraid of what his reaction would be.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s…okay. I’m not mad,” he said quietly. Beka listened closely. She heard his tone, and, as carefully disguised as it was, she heard the hurt and the anger. She’d betrayed him in the worst way possible.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You’re lying,” she said, looking up from the sheets to gaze into his fiery blue eyes. There was a war of emotions fighting across his face. He was trying to hold back, for her sake, but she knew better than to let him suppress something that made him this angry. “Harper, let it out.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“How could you?” he snapped immediately after her sentence finished. She flinched at the vehemence she heard.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I…I wasn’t thinking,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Bull! I know you, Beka. I know you better than anyone on this ship. And I know you’re always thinking,” he yelled. Every word dripped with anger. “You took it willingly. You knew the consequences and you took it anyway. Why?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Because—” she couldn’t finish. She searched her mind for the answer but kept coming up empty. Then, suddenly, she saw the answer. And it shamed her just as much as taking Flash had. “Because I wanted to prove myself.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“To who? Me? Tyr? Rommie?” He paused. “Dylan?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yes,” she whispered. “I wanted to show him I was good enough. I wanted to be the one to take him back to Tarn Vedra.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I see,” he said. “So, get Dylan home and the rest of your crew be damned! What were all those speeches you gave me about not having to prove myself, huh? Why does it matter if Dylan thinks you’re a great pilot? I think you are. And so do Trance and Rev. That wasn’t enough for you?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No, it is. You know I value all of you,” she said, trying, in vain, to defend herself, though she didn’t see much point in it. Harper was right.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You do realize what you did, right? You shot Rev! You practically killed Trance! And…”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Say it, Harper.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“And you hurt me. You used one of my biggest fears against me to get me to shut up. And it worked,” he seethed through clenched teeth. “Which makes you no better than the Ubers I left behind on Earth.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper, no!” she shouted. He closed his eyes. He winced as if the very words he spoke hurt him just as badly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I wanna hate you, Beka. I wish I could treat you like everyone else whoever hurt me and just hate you!” he yelled. His eyes softened, glimmering with unshed tears. She reached out and touched his arm. He took in a huge breath, but didn’t pull away from her. “But I can’t. I can’t hate you. I love you too much to hate you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka burst into tears after his confession. She’d caused him so much pain, so much torment and he still loved her. Despite everything, he still loved her. Harper moved from the chair to the bed. He squeezed in next to her, wrapping his arms around her shaking body.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, Harper,” she sobbed. Harper only held her closer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s okay, Beka. I forgive you,” he whispered into her ear. “And I’m gonna be with you every step of the way. I swear you won’t ever touch the stuff so long as I live.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka nodded against his chest, knowing he meant every word. He didn’t let go of her. Not when she fell asleep in his arms when crying exhausted her; not when they both woke up the next morning and she fought him tooth and nail when a craving for Flash hit her; not when she cried herself to sleep in his arms again, apologizing like crazy; not ever did he let go. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Its Hour Come Round At Last &amp; The Widening Gyre:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka slammed her fists against the door to Harper’s quarters. He’d run out of medical after learning about his stomach being infested with Magog eggs. Even after Rev and Trance telling him they’d search for a cure and Tyr trying to convince him that there was hope so long as he was alive, he still ran. There were so many conduits on the ship, it could take days to actually find the little engineer, but Beka had a feeling he was closer than they all thought. When the door to his quarters didn’t open upon her request, she knew he was inside.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Dammit, Harper, open up! It’s Beka!” she shouted. She looked up. “Andromeda!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I can’t open the door, Beka. Harper’s used a maximum override. Not even Dylan could get in,” Andromeda said, her voice echoing throughout the corridor. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Thanks a lot,” Beka grumbled. She grabbed her force lance, aiming at the door. “Want something done right, you’ve got to do it yourself.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
She fired on the code pad. The tiny device blew out of the wall, wires and circuits springing from the wall, sparking. The door immediately opened. Light filled the room. Harper was never one to hang around in dark places, but Beka couldn’t even find his lava lamp. The room was completely black. She entered cautiously, afraid she’d scare her friend. He was probably panicked, which meant he wouldn’t be in a right state of mind. She found the bed empty; the sheets weren’t even disturbed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper, I know you’re in here. Come on, it’s me. It’s Beka. I’m not gonna hurt you,” she said, keeping her voice low. She listened to the room, waiting patiently for him to make a move or say something. She heard him. It was the tiniest of sobs, but she heard him. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He was curled up in a ball in the far corner of his room. He was still wearing the medical gown; I.V packs attached to his neck and chest. Tears rolled down his cheeks from bloodshot eyes. His body shook. His arms were wrapped around his stomach. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka wanted to cry. She’d never seen him so devastated. His worst nightmare had come true. She got down on her knees and crawled over to him. Cautiously, she touched his knee. He didn’t move, didn’t blink. He hardly seemed to know she was there. She moved closer, sitting next to him, waiting for his reaction. There was no reaction. Taking it one step further, she put her arms around him, wrapping him in her warmth and strength. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s okay, Harper. I’m here. I’m here,” she soothed, whispering into his ear. More tears fell down his cheeks. His sobs turned into flat out crying. He leaned into her, taking his arms away from his stomach and hugging her waist. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I don’t wanna die, Beka,” he mumbled into her shirt. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I don’t want you to either,” she said, rubbing his back as more sobs wracked his damaged body. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I can feel them. They’re moving, eating me. They’re gonna kill me,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You’re not gonna die, Harper. I swear it. We’ll find some way,” she said, squeezing his arm. “If I have to go to the ends of the universe to get those things out, I’ll do it!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Don’t make me any promises,” he said. She lifted his head. They looked into each others eyes. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I don’t make promises lightly, Harper. You know that,” she said. “And if I say we’ll get them out, then we’ll get them out.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He stared at her blankly. “I wanna believe you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Then do it,” she said. He gave her his askew grin through the extra tears that fell down his cheeks. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Okay,” he whispered. She continued to rub his back in slow, circular motions. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Feel like going back to med-deck? Trance is a little worried,” Beka said. His smile faded.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No,” he said, shaking his head violently. “I just wanna stay here.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Okay. How about getting into bed, then? You need to rest.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, sure,” he said. She helped him to his feet. He hunched over, grabbing his stomach. She helped him walk over to his bed, pulling out the blanket and sheets. He slipped under the covers easily, gripping his pillow, keeping his back to her. Instead of leaving to go tell the others, Beka scooted into the bed. Harper was lying with his back against her chest. She reached over and took his hand, keeping a protective arm over him. She listened to him breathe. At first, it was short gasps of air as his body tried to calm itself down. Then, his breaths became deep and calm. He kept hold of her hand like a lifeline. When he was finally asleep, she didn’t dare leave him. She didn’t want him to wake up alone, knowing what was in his body. She swore she’d keep him alive or she would die trying.<br>

<br>
Exit Strategies:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <br>
Harper sat amongst his projects in machine shop 6. He’d been hiding in conduits and basically avoiding everyone for the past three weeks, leaving many of his favorite gizmos and projects unattended. After his talks with Rommie and Rev, he decided to finally return to his old routine. But he could never really return to the old routine; not with thirteen little Magog swimming around inside his body. Just thinking about them made his stomach hurt. He grabbed his stomach, flinching from the sudden pain. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Rev and Trance were working on making his medication into an inhaler, but for the moment, he was stuck having to get injections on a regular basis in medical so that the eggs stayed dormant.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He heard the door open. Looking over his shoulder, he saw Beka storming in. His initial reaction was to smile and ask her what was up, but the murderous look in her eyes made him scramble to his feet.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Boss, what’s—” Beka pushed him before he could finish. He fell to the ground, narrowly missing one of his sharply pointed projects. Beka stood over him. He’d never seen her so angry, almost to the point of tears.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What the hell were you thinking?” she shouted. She grabbed his shirt, pulling him up a few inches off the floor. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Beka, you’re gonna have to be a little less vague,” he said, trying to keep his voice calm. His rapid breathing, however, was proving to be harder to control. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka glared at him. “Rommie told me.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper’s face fell, the color draining away, leaving him a disgusting shade of pale. Beka let go of his shirt. He didn’t try to cushion his fall, his head hitting the floor hard. He felt one of the eggs move, but chose to ignore the pain. He watched Beka pace in front of him. Her hands swung back and forth in angry, clenched fists.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I can’t believe you! Killing yourself! Suicide!” she shouted.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s my decision, Beka. Last I checked, my body wasn’t your property,” he argued.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Don’t get smart with me, Seamus!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Don’t tell me how to run my life, Beka!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What life? You obviously seem eager to end it!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I’ve got thirteen Magog eggs in my stomach! Excuse me if I think death is a better alternative to suffering!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
They were both breathing heavily from the shouting. They hadn’t fought this badly since Harper’s first few months on the Maru.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Fine! Just end it all! Never mind the people who’re trying to save your life!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Oh, no! Don’t you turn this into a guilt trip, Beka! You don’t know anything about this! I’ve seen it. I’ve watched people I love – my cousins – suffer in horrible, agonizing pain with these little parasites inside them,” he said. He’d stopped shouting. His voice was low, revealing years of pain and loss. He was living his nightmare. “So don’t you dare try to make me feel bad because I want to die. Right now, death is my only foreseeable future.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka resisted the urge to yell at him again. He gently rubbed his stomach, feeling another egg move. He wasn’t supposed to stress himself too much, but stress seemed unavoidable at the moment. Beka approached him. His muscles tensed. He was ready to bolt if she tried to grab him again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Get up,” she said calmly. Harper quickly got to his feet. Beka pulled out her gauss gun. “Do you really wanna die that badly, Seamus?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yes,” he said. She winced when she heard his answer. She pointed the gauss gun at him. His eyes widened, but he didn’t try to stop her. She turned it around, handing it to him. <br>
“Go on, take it,” she said. He took the gauss gun hesitantly, unsure of her intentions. “Do it.”<br>
<br>
“Pardon?”<br>
<br>
“Kill yourself. End it now. Right here, in front of me,” she said. His eyes darted from the gun to her. He said nothing, but gripped the handle of the gun tighter. Slowly, he pushed the barrel against his stomach, both hands ready to pull the trigger. Beka had to fight her gut reaction to grab the gun from him. She just hoped her plan worked. Harper swallowed hard, his eyes beginning to sparkle with tears. He looked up at the ceiling, calling on some inner strength. Suddenly, he dropped the gun, a huge sob escaping. His arms hugged his stomach. Beka rushed to his side, wrapping her arms around him. They were both crying. <br>
<br>
“It’s okay, Harper. It’s okay. I’m here,” she whispered. <br>
<br>
“I can’t, Beka. I … can’t,” he cried. A question tugged at Beka’s heart. She knew she had to ask it.<br>
<br>
“You can’t kill yourself or you can’t kill yourself in front of me?” she asked. <br>
<br>
“Both,” he said, his sobs becoming quieter. She smiled, rubbing his back. She held him at arms length, wiping the tears away from his face with her thumbs. She cupped his face in her hands. <br>
<br>
“I know I’m asking a lot of you, Harper, but I need you to stick around. It’s selfish, I know, but I can’t lose you,” she confessed. He smiled, placing his hands over hers. <br>
<br>
“You won’t,” he whispered. <br>
<br>
She hugged him again. She felt him hug back, his arms tightly wrapped around her. Neither wanted to let go, but they found some way after a few minutes. It was a constant struggle from then on for the two friends to be far apart without wanting to run and find the other. In the middle of the night, when Harper succumbed to sleep and relived his nightmares over and over, all Beka had to do was touch his face and slip into bed with him and he’d feel the nightmares fade away. <br>
<br>
<br>
A Heart for Falsehood Framed:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
They sat around the bar, drinking champagne and congratulating themselves on a mission well done, despite the few minor setbacks. Dylan had gone back to the Command Deck after a few drinks, leaving Beka, Harper, and Trance to celebrate. The celebration, however, felt oddly subdued compared to other post-theft parties they’d had in the past.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You have to admit it was fun,” Beka said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yep! Nothing like theft to make you feel good about yourself,” Harper said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Could we do it again?” Trance asked. Harper and Beka smiled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No, Trance, I don’t think we can do it again,” Beka said. “It wouldn’t look very good for the Commonwealth if the people trying to restore it were convicted felons.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Aren’t we already convicted felons?” Trance asked. Beka looked at Harper. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Maybe we should talk to Dylan about getting our records erased,” Harper said. Beka nodded in agreement. Trance took another sip of champagne. She offered some to Harper, but he declined. He had to limit his alcohol intake because of the ever present Magog eggs. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Do you guys ever wonder where we’d be if we hadn’t joined Dylan and Rommie?” Trance asked. The other two thought for a moment. In actuality, they’d never really wondered. Nor had they realized how much being on the Andromeda had changed their lives.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Probably still running salvage, or scams,” Beka said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Jail, most likely,” Harper said. Beka saw his hand lightly rub his stomach. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What about you, Trance?” Beka asked. Trance shrugged, her eyes darting around the room.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Oh, I’d still be with you, Beka,” Trance said, smiling. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I guess so,” Beka said with a smile. She couldn’t imagine her crew without Trance. Still, she gazed back at Harper. His saddened eyes stared off into space. She touched his arm. He jolted, looking at her in surprise. “Hey, what’s up?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Oh, nothing,” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Liar,” she said. She looked down at his stomach. “They bothering you?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Huh? No, not much,” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Why must you continue to lie?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I was just thinking…” he trailed off. Beka and Trance exchanged concerned looks. Harper, while normally a very sarcastic and cynical person, was becoming increasingly melancholy. He didn’t joke as often as he used to and when he did there was always a little bit of bitterness edged in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“About what?” Trance asked. He sighed, looking at them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Would it have been so bad if we hadn’t joined up with Dylan? I mean, we had fun, right? Pirates in space? Maybe it would have been better,” he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Maybe you wouldn’t have these Magog in your stomach?” Beka said. Harper nodded ever so slightly. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Not that I’m complaining or anything. I know my purple princess is working on a cure,” Harper said, smiling at Trance. She returned the smile. “But, yeah, I wouldn’t have these things inside me and Rev wouldn’t have had to go through what he did. He didn’t deserve that.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What’s the old saying? ‘That which does not kill us only makes us stronger,’” Beka said. Harper grinned. Rev had used the phrase many times in the past and present and probably still would in the future.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“We’ve certainly had our share of those situations,” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Then maybe the best way to look at it is the positive side. You and Rev are still alive,” Trance said. Harper nodded. “And you’re both becoming stronger because of the World Ship. Rev is overcoming his inner demons just the same as you are. You’re just dealing with it in a more literal sense.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Assuming either of us win,” Harper said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper!” Beka snapped. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I know, think positively,” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“How about I think doubly positive? That way you don’t have to work as hard as it,” Trance suggested. Harper started laughing. Beka joined him. When the laughter stopped, Harper looked gratefully at Trance.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Thanks, Trance. That would mean a lot,” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Don’t mention it,” she said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“So are we done celebrating?” Beka asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I guess so. You can only dwell on this stuff for s long,” Harper said, smiling, really smiling at them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
They left the Maru feeling better about the mission and a few other things.<br>
<br>
<br>
All Too Human:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper groaned as consciousness slowly came to him. His eyes remained closed but he was determined to open them. Lights made him squint but he kept them open. A blurry figure stood over him. Her golden hair was haloed by the lights, making her look like an angel. He already knew it was Beka. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, Boss,” he said tiredly. She didn’t smile. He knew he was in trouble. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I swear, Seamus, you can be so stupid sometimes,” Beka breathed. As tired as he felt, Harper was fully awake. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What’d I do?” he asked. Beka eyed him suspiciously.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What’s the last thing you remember?” she asked. Harper closed his eyes, thinking about his last memories. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I was on the Maru. We were waiting for Rommie. Rev was telling me not to stress myself and…I’m kind of drawing a blank after that,” Harper said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You overdosed, Harper,” Beka said. Harper’s eyes bulged when he heard the information.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I what?” he exclaimed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“When Rev and Tyr brought you in, Rev said you’d accidentally overdosed while repairing the Maru,” Beka informed him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“There, see! It was an accident!” Harper said defensively. Beka crossed her arms over her chest.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It shouldn’t have happened in the first place,” she said. “Harper, you know you have to be careful.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, you weren’t there. I was under a lot of stress. It’s tough being the only guy who can fix everything plus having the added bonus of thirteen Magog in your gut. So, I’m sorry, okay?” he said angrily. Beka was staring down at the floor. They had been putting an awful lot of stress on him without considering what it would do to him with the Magog inside him. Considering everything that had happened since his infestation, she was surprised he hadn’t overdosed sooner. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I – I’m sorry, Harper,” she said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper sighed, half smiling. “It’s okay. It’s not you fault.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You could’ve died, Harper,” she said, her voice catching in her throat.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, I didn’t,” he said, some edge returning to his voice. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Not from the overdose. You could have died in the Maru,” she said. He stared at her in confusion. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What?” he asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“The Maru. It was sinking. There was only one E.V.A. suit for the three of you,” Beka said. Harper still looked lost. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“There was? Then…how did I get here?” he asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, Rev was able to hold his breath and Tyr…” she trailed off. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah? Tyr what?” Harper pressed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Tyr…drowned himself so you could use the E.V.A. suit,” Beka said. She waited for the outburst exclamation she knew would come from the engineer. Surprisingly, it never came. Harper sat up in silent shock. His eyes glistened. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“He did? Why – why would he do that? He’s a Nietzschean! Drowning himself to save someone else doesn’t make sense!” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Maybe Tyr was saving a friend,” Beka suggested. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No. Nietzscheans and Kludges aren’t friends,” Harper said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper, up here, you’re not a Kludge,” she scolded. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, I know,” he said. “But why?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Maybe you should go ask him yourself,” Beka said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Maybe,” he whispered. Beka wrapped her arms around him. Harper was startled at first, but eventually returned the hug. “What was that for?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“For still being here so I can yell at you,” she said, ruffling his hair. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, if that’s the only reason you want me around,” Harper said, smiling. She smacked him in the back of the head.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Ha! Kidding,” he said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Get out of here, psycho,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“With pleasure,” he said, bouncing off the bed. She heard him running down the corridor. Just barely she heard him call out, “Hey, Tyr, wait up!”<br>
