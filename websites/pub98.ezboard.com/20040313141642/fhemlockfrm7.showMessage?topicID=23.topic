I dont mind debate at all. I actually enjoy intelligent debate. And would never hold personal oppinions against anyone. <br>
<br>
I just have strong oppinions on things. However, many have complained to Ash about me.. Im a know it all, im to bossy etc... Im also been listed by 90% of the people who have left this guild as one of there reasons.<br>
<br>
I was asked to step down, so I decided to remove myself.. The leadership of this guild is doing nothing at the moment to improve our situation. Over the past few days, I have been very vocal about where I personally want to go in game and how I see us getting there. (just wanted to edit this so it did not come off wrong) Times in guild are extrememly tough right now.. I was also part of the leadership doing nothing.... Just wanted to point that out as to not seam like the innocent person.<br>
<br>
I also cant stand censorship.. This board is HIGHELY censored in case you all didnt realize it.. if there is a thread with anything in the least bit negative, it will be moved so no one can see it.  The reason will be there was nothing else to say.. yes thats a huge pet peave of mine.. that to me is hiding things and basically lying.. yet you will never see an AK post moved.. it will stay up there with a sticky.. <br>
<br>
Time factor is also a huge difference.. I want to raid.. I play Asian time. The Guild is on EST. You all dont see me on 8 to 9 hours a day... because your all logged off. You dont see me waking up at 3am for raids on my saturday because its like 1pm saturday there. 5 days a week I play pretty much not even in guild because im the only person on for the whole time im logged in. <br>
<br>
Just many factors added in.. and being told im the reason that basically what.. 30 people have left guild over the course of 4 months.. and not a single tell from a person that has any issues with me.. just tells me that as i posted above.. are cowards and cant handle there own situations.. One thing I really hate is cry babies which seams to be what many of the playerbase that we end up getting in guild are. And no.. im not making a claim to any one indivual.. Ash never told me a single persons name who has complained about me. she just tells me she got an email etc.. so /shrug hope who ever you are, are very happy with yourself.. <br>
<br>
Instead of talking to the person you have an issue with you go behind there back and tell mommy because you have no idea how to handle your own situation... <br>
<br>
I would also like to remind who ever it was, is, was over time who ever you are out there.. dont bother to post how it was you now.. how your not a cry baby, how you didnt blah blah blah... I shouldnt have to provoke someone to contfront there problems by challenging them. Any adult should try to confron there problems first, then later on if that still does not work take it to someone else... those are life skills that seams many people are lacking. <br>
<br>
Then again.. I guess it makes me nice and happy that so many people are afraid to talk to me, as I probolly wouldnt enjoy talking to these people anyway as they are not mature enough for me.. anyone who talks to me knows im a sweatheart (even if i cant spell) right Elysse <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I have known you for what...2, 3 yearsish?<br>
<br>
And I have had many fights and arguments with you, on boards, and in guild chat, but you are a totally different person in tells, not as intimidating as people may see you, shit I know how you are feeling, as I was a reason a lot of people left HoH, cause I seemed, intimidating, unable to talk to, so they just /guildremove instead of coming to me with something that could be resolved so easily...<br>
<br>
I hate to see you go,  but I understand your reasoning, you and I are one in the same in most aspects, send me an email every now and then I still like talking to you and going on about things, debates, rants etc etc<br>
<br>
Or if I am in game and you are on, send me a tell, new character name is Karmen for now<br>

Talk to you later ~hugs~<br>

Well, regardless.. Im not quitting game. Im still on Server, im just not in guild. I have no ambitions on joining any guild at the moment, not a single guild strikes my interest. /shrug. <br>

Yes Neil, im a son of a bitch because sometimes thats what it takes. Problem is, lots of inexperienced players who do not realize that... sometimes that is what it takes. <br>

Most Vocal / Oppinionated person / high position of authority = Scapegoat.  So be it.. I would actually bother me being the reason 90% of those who left the guild did so if I got a single tell...
