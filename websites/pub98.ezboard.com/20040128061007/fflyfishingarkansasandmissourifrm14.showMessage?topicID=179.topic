Spent the morning at the fair grounds wandering around, met an old buddy I rarely see, learned to tie a really cool ant, got to cast some new rods, learned more neat stuff, filled out a survey by AF&amp;G, met Stan Todd and generally hung out and took it all in.<br>

You must have been out fishing....maybe. I figured you worked the crowd Friday and got a chance to hit the water Saturday. We hit the Little Red on the way home. Lee caught a couple on the Chili Pepper. I didn't do so well, casting basically sucked. I think we got into the crane flies. About a size 16, chartreuse body and swept back clear wings. Weird looking fly. Plus there was a smaller fly coming off, too. Looked like a caddis from what I could tell. All in all, a pretty interesting weekend except for my lack of casting.

I was there all day, both Saturday and Sunday. We must have just missed each other. We took some time off Sunday evening / morning to do some night fishing. It was NUTS! We heard some HUGE fish working the water, and busting every so often. We were using gear so heavy that if a fish was less than 20&quot; you pretty much just flipped them in. One of the guys actually hooked &quot;Jaws&quot;. He never had a chance with this fish. I heard it breach from 300 feet away and I sounded like someone threw a Volkswagon in the river. He was into his backing within a couple of seconds. He never turned the fish. It eventually wrapped him on a stump and the game was over. 20 pound test or not, its still hard to turn a fish that fights like hooking a car running down the highway. I got goose bumps just watching it happen. <br>

This was my first time at the conclave as well. It was a great day! Met John and Troy and took casting lessons from them both. That in itself would have been worth driving twice as far. <br>
<br>
Thanks- John and Troy.<br>
<br>
I was also able to sit down with one of the fly tiers and correct a few problems I have been having. <br>
<br>
This week we will be visiting a few local shops to make a final decision on which new outfits to buy to get us started. John may have ruined us by giving us our first lesson with that new G. Loomis Streamdance GLX. Very, very nice! But way out of our price range as beginners. <br>
<br>
Anyway, we had a great time, learned a lot, and met some terrific people. It was well worth giving up a day of bow hunting. Not too many things can make me say that.<br>
<br>
Thanks again, John and Troy.<br>

The two of you did &quot;very&quot; well with your casting. I was impressed with how quickly you picked it up. You'll be hooking into 40 pound browns in no time.

Getting the fly to drift or move in just the way you  intend is every it as important as where you put it.<br>
<br>
My son is really coming into his own as a flyfisher, and I'm so proud to help him during this discovery phase.  I've waited 9 years for this time to get here, and I'm relishing every chance we get to build a solid fishing buddy relationship.  When he notices something, I make sure I learn from him too.  All two-way relationships work better than one-ways.<br>
<br>
John -- As I was casting that Stream Dance or whatever it's called, I noticed it also said GLX.  Is it basically a GLX with a paint job, or have they done something performance-wise?  I didn't quite manage the entire flyline with it, couldn't get the backing past the stripper.  But I've also never cast a full flyline with any 5 weight rod, so that rod is certainly the closest I've come in this line weight.  My 6 wt XTR will launch a full line with some backing besides, so that's what I have to compare to on a light distance rod.  How would you rate the Stream Dance compared to the TCR?  <br>

<br>
The GLX is the graphite. Just off the top of my head (don't quote me) the GLX graphite is like 90 million modules, the IMX is like 70 million modules and the GL3 graphite is like 60 million. All the GLX reflects is what the rod is made of. Loomis made its trout rods of the GLX graphite for so long that the name stuck and became synomomus with the rod. <br>
<br>
The lines we had on the demo rods were Airflow lines. I'd recommend that you try it with either a SA XXD or a Sage performance taper. Drew was throwing the XXD right around 120 the other day with the Max Line Speed Model. Did you cast the Max line or the High line model Troy. The Max is the best tracking distance rod I've ever cast. For me the action is comperable to the TCR except it has the feel that the TCR lacks. Drew got some of the Sage line to do a head to head comparison. I'd be willing to bet they are very close performance wise. It might go either way on the total distance in the long run.<br>
<br>
I'm curious what they cast at the ISE shows this year. At some point you need handeling as well as horse power.<br>

I'm not up to speed on the similarities with IM6 and GL3. Although, I think GL3 was a few generations above IM6. I don't necessarly see the signifigance to taking the test with a graphite though. The rod either performs or it dosen't. If you look at some of the old ACA casting distances they wern't &quot;that&quot; different from those of today. Most of the tournaments had distances in the 180 foot range with bamboo even in the 30's. It may not be the 190's but it's not far off the mark. <br>
<br>
However, for the purposes of testing you are looking for &quot;perfection&quot;. I'd of been glad to have lent you a rod. Although, I'm not sure you would have wanted to take the test with a 5 weight either. Pretty much it depends on the wind. If you have a cross wind it is all but impossible to track a target. About all you can do is throw and hope for some luck. That is unless you &quot;bang&quot; the target. That's when a 7 weight might come in handy on a 45 foot target. Truthfully when the winds were light we were banging targets at 70 feet with a 5 weight. The wind is a killer for tracking.<br>

<br>
For the same given amount of stiffness, yes. But there are alot of factors that go into the construction of a rod. The blank is only about 1/2 the total weight. The difference in 60 million modules 5 weight vs 90 million modules 5 weight would be very little weight wise.<br>

<br>
&quot;Modulus&quot;, aka Young's Modulus, aka MOE (Modulus of Elasticity), aka elastic coefficient is the slope of the stress/strain curve for any material.  In english, what that means is that it tells you how stiff a material is.  It is the amount of force it takes to change the length of a specimen that is initially a certain length, to a certain new length.  The units would be something like psi (pounds per inch per inch).  So if you started with a rubber band that was one inch long, and wanted to stretch it to 2&quot; long, it would be the tension force required.  Materials that have a higher elastic modulus require more force before they will stretch or compress a given amount.<br>
<br>
When a flyrod bends, the fibers that are on the outside of the curve must stretch, and those on the inside of the curve must compress.  Those that lie on the centerline would neither compress nor stretch,  but remain at neutral stress.  Many materials (most metals) have the same modulus in tension and compression (known as isotropic).  Many materials have different modulus in tension and compression (anisotropic).  Glass, carbon fiber, bamboo -- i.e. the typical materials we make flyrods from -- are anisotropic.<br>
<br>
When a rod designer is designing a rod taper, he has numerous parameters to juggle.  Material modulus is only one of them.  He also has to consider the tube OD (outside diameter) and the wall thickness of the tube.  He can increase the stiffness at any given point along the rod blank by:<br>
<br>
Increasing the modulus<br>
Increasing the OD of the tube<br>
Increasing the wall thickness.<br>
<br>
Each of thes choices has benefits and drawbacks.  Let's look at each one.  <br>
<br>
If you excessively increase the modulus, it tends to get brittle.  As you might guess, brittleness can lead to premature failure.<br>
<br>
If you significantly increase the OD of the tube to gain stiffness, you will increase the air resistance of the blank and the rod will tend to load itself even without the line load.<br>
<br>
If you dramatically increase the wall thickness, you will be using more material in the blank.  This will make the rod heavier, and slower because of the self-loading induced by the extra weight.  If you make it too thin, it will risk damage due to nicks, split shot dings, etc.<br>
<br>
As you can see, the rod designer can vary these choices and come up with drastically different bending characters.  Also related, he can vary the rate that the blanks will spring back to neutral once the  load is removed.  This is what defines each rod's &quot;action&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'm not certain about this, but I'm not aware of any rod companies successfully using graphites as stiff as 90 mpsi.  Maybe with some of the newer epoxy resins, but you'll want to be cautious about them if you try them.  Personally, I'll wait until they're proven to be durable.<br>
<br>
In summary, higher modulus allows a rod manufacturer to make rods with smaller diameters (less air resistance), and thinner walls (lighter weight and less self-loading).  But there's a limit to how far you can take this, before you reach durability limits.  You also have to consider that most casters cannot cast an extremely stiff rod (think broomstick), so manufacturers need to make rods that flex in a usable manner.  Everything in moderation...<br>

I'll give Tucker a shot when I get up there on Wednesday.  Remind me, is there an easy access  spot where I can park and reach the river pretty easily?  Thanks, Jimmy --<br>

On the right is a Rock pile with big chunck rock and below that is a shallow gravel bar.  When the water is up it creates an eddy.  You'll see where it drops off and gets pretty deep.  There are some dang good fish there amongst the suckers.  <br>
<br>
If you know Tony Spezio I'd give him a shout to see if you could acess tucker through his property.  Tucker is about 200 yards above his house.  I havn't seen any Big fish at the top of the shoal yet although I'm sure there are some there.  Most will be below the shoals and on the very far side right hand side in the middle of the shoal.  Especially if there is any tail water.  There is a rock ledge on the left side of the shoal at the bottom as well that is a little deeper.  You can walk down the middle of the river on the shallow gravel bar and work both sides of the river.  The gravel bar comes to an end and some times there are some brown trout hanging out there.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.  When are you headed this way??<br>
