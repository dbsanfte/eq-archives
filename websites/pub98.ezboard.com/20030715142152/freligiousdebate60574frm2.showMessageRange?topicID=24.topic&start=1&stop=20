I feel very strongly about it. I used to work in day cares and while I know there is good care out there, because I gave it, no one will take better care of my children than I will.  <p>Paige<br>

I do believe it is biblical to stay home.  One vs that comes to mind would be Titus 2:5  says we should be keepers at home.   But I also don't believe your in sin if you have a job.  I think the bible is saying its &quot;better' to be at home.   I think if you just can't afford to live then it would be ok to get a job until things get better.  But I dont think a women should be working to abtain material things vs being able to care for, and raise her own children all day.<br>
<br>
I am soooo thankful I can be home.  I wouldn't choose to have someone else do most of my parenting job.  I want to be there for that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I think it is important.  I think its good for the child to have his/her mom home for them.

Some parents just are not happy staying home. It doesn't make them better, or worse, it's just fact. And you can not convince me that happy parents are not better parents. <br>
Not everyone makes a good stay home parent. <br>
<br>
I stayed home with Samantha for 6 months after she was born--I was lucky, I got 6 months 100% paid leave. I could not have gone back to work--there was no way I could've left her at that age. I went back 10 hours a week, at night, when she was 6 months old, and have gradually increased my hours over the past 3 years until now, and I am working full time again. She is perfectly able to handle this now, and she is in preschool twice a week anyway. I, for one, was not very happy being solely stay-home. I missed the power, and control I had at work, and liked being in that &quot;mode&quot; again.<br>
I was happy being back at work, and I think being a happy parent is way better than being a miserable parent that's home 24/7.<br>
<br>
And obviously, being atheist, I have no religious views on the matter, except for thinking it's sad when women who truly *don't* want to be stay-home-moms DO stay home, simply because they think it's what they should do, and become miserable. I think that's a shame, for both mom and the rest of the family.<br>

<br>
However..I do stay at home...I could never go out to work and leave my kids..miss those milestones etc. (not saying that I look down on anyone who does - but for me it wouldn't work) - many people think I *should* work, as my DH doesn't work either...but as well as being a SAHM, I am a stay at home carer for him too - so I do more than my fair share..if I didn't stay at home..as well as finding a day care for the children, I'd have to find a carer for my DH too.<br>
<br>
At the moment, I am studying law..I don't know whether I will want to, or be able to, do anything with it at the end of it..but for now it is fun to study..and nice to know that I will have something to fall back on if necessary. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.growthspurts.com/drivee/images/434360233606.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tinlizzy@religiousdebate60574>TinLizzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/2/03 8:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Calling All Stay @ Home Moms</span><hr size=1> I'm another mom who couldn't be happy staying home all the time.  I took a year off when Hallie was born and am glad I did--but I was so ready to go back to work by then.  I have worked part-time for the past year and a half, and it's the best of both worlds to me.  While it's important for me to spend time with Hallie, I also need the adult interaction and mental stimulation I get at work.  And I think Hallie, being an only child, gets a lot out of the home daycare she goes to 3 days/wk.  She has her little friends there and loves it, and she has learned a lot from the other kids.  It has worked all around for everyone--I also completely agree with the happy mom=happy family idea.  It's just that what makes a family work is different from family to family.<br>

I quit my job when I got pregnant with my first child- but that was coincidence, as we moved for hubby's new job, and there didn't seem to be a reason to get a new one, when I knew I would be staying home.<br>
<br>
As an atheist, I don't feel that there is any biblical reason or religious reason for staying home. I stay home with my kids because it is our choice, as a married couple, and because I am truly happy doing so. I have good friends who are truly happy working. I respect both sides. I think there are so many factors- mom's temperment, finances, goals.....they all have to be taken into account to see what works for each family.  We are very fortunate that there is no need for me to work financially, and tempermentally, I seem to be holding up just fine (no need for the funny farm yet)....<br>
<br>
I always wanted to be a mom. It was my goal in life, and when I started dating my husband, he confessed that he wanted his wife to stay home with the kids. So it was a match for us....;-)<br>

I love being with my kids but hate the fact that I am lonely. I live in small town and there isn't any resources out hear. None of my friends have kids. Its been really hard for me. I would never  go back to work because I really do love being with my kids (most of the time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).

I do not attend a church, so I don't have even that support as a SAHM.  Although we do have several Christian friends that we sometimes get together with, none of them have children and all of them work full-time.  It makes it a little easier for me, b/c my husband is home most of the time.  (He owns his own business and runs it out of our home, so unless he's out on a call, he's usually here with me.)<br>
<br>
Like you, I love being home with my baby, but there are times when I too feel that there is &quot;something missing.&quot;  I find that these boards help me alot though, in that I can have an intelligent conversation with adults from time to time.  (Although I find it difficult to switch into &quot;adult mode&quot; sometimes, after I've been trying to communicate with a 1 year old all day!  lol)  <br>

<br>
I would say no.  At our church there are lots of moms who stay home and lots who work.   its not preached from the pulpit that moms need to stay home with their kids.  We dont all sit around talking about being a SAHM.   I think it is hard at times.  Sometimes I think it would easier to go get a job to get away from everyone, but I know that wouldn't really help.  But like every mom out there we all have some hard days!!!!  These boards are nice.  Its my adult time during parts of the day!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Being a military family I'm lucky, there are alot of other SAHMs to hang out with, though the religious ones seem to be the majority of them, but then that's also the military too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

I've friends who have told me they couldn't do my job. They have to get out of the house and work for their sanity and for a sense of purpose. I don't blame them. There are days when DH has to remind me that I don't have to refer to myself in third person to him. <br>
<br>
I would love for society to be more accepting of our choices, SAH or working. But it seems no matter what you decide its damned if you do or damned if you don't. What pisses me off though are other mothers who make judgements on you and what you do. I've been looked down at by other working mothers and I've seen my working mother friends looked down at by die hard (sorry but this is my observation) bible thumping sahms. <br>
<br>
I am going to attempt to find a preschool for my child when she turns 3. I want a little one on one time with my younger time and I MIGHT start looking into going back to school earlier then orginally planned - was going to go when they start school, but I could use the mental stimultion.<br>
<br>
The boards are great. I would go brain-dead if not for them. <br>

<br>
and then I slap myself out of it.<br>
<br>
I quit my job 3 years ago because we were trying to get pregnant, and it wasn't happening so I set out to eliminate the added stress in my life.  Turns out on my last day of work, I was 2 weeks pregnant.<br>
<br>
I was like Emmy, I love the control and &quot;power&quot; that I had when I was working...I was good at what I did, my boss knew it, and my co-workers knew it...they thought I was nuts to leave a promising career in the banking system to be &quot;mom&quot;...but there is nothing else that I have ever been able to see myself doing as a career other than &quot;mom&quot;  <br>
<br>
I was &quot;called&quot; to be a mom, if you will.  I know that, and I remind myself of that when I begin to get the crazy thoughts of going back to work.  (That and the thought of someone else raising my son for the majority of the day just doesn't cut it with me.)<br>

With 4 kids, 2 that are 3 year old twin, there is no way that working and putting 2 in daycare would be worth it. We sure could use the money, but i also think it is important to be at home with you littles ones for as long as possible. When my older kids were young, i didnt work either, but when they hit about age 3, I got a part-time job and they were only left with their dad.  Also, one of my twins, Tori, has Juvenile Diabetes and is too young to be left in the care of someone who is not me. As for it being biblical, back when I was a full fledged xian, it didnt weigh into my decision to stay at home.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ctrlaltdelirious>CtrlAltDelirious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/2/03 12:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/cordelia/images/heartsandstars.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Calling All Stay @ Home Moms</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Sometimes it is very hard to see that when you have a 2 1/2 year old whinning non stop for 12 hours strait.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I stayed at home for almost 2 years with DD, then went back to work.  I had to leave that job because we were moving, and now after 4 months of being at home again, I'm ready to head back into the work force.<br>
<br>
It's partially financial, and partially because I think that it is good for me and DD.  DH works long and strange hours and because of where we live it isn't always possible to get outside during the day for long (way too cold).<br>
<br>
I don't know... I just finished paying off my student loan and feel that somehow all that money is going to waste.  I'm very good at what I do and miss the feeling I had when I was working.  I guess I miss the independence of having my own money...<br>

I'm an atheist, so no religious implications for me. . . just the quotidian tasks of mothering four children that keep me (for the time being) from returning to work.<br>

I always knew I wanted to be a sahm when i grew up, even before i was Mormon.<br>
<br>
The church does encourage mothers to sah whenever possible.<br>
<br>
The church really is a good support...not just for sahm's, but for families in general. The women have their own Sunday class, we have meetings/activities 1 evening a month, there are often playgroups, etc. Husbands are encouraged to support their wives in these activities. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Each woman is assigned a &quot;Visiting Teacher&quot; who visits you monthly. Likewise, you are someone elses visiting teacher.<br>
We have moved a lot, but we always feel we have a home at church. It's the same, every where in the world. The programs are the same, the lesson/study materials are the same...same church, just different people each time. They are a wonderful support for families. Last year, my dh was laid off from his job, i was 10 weeks from delivering our 4th baby, and they helped us so much.
