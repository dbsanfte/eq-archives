I clearly said that the problem was that he provided the small amount of information that he did.  I said that with such a brief pass-over of it, he should have either omitted that portion completely, or he should have added a little more.  He made slight reference to a physicist's book, why not give a complete reference/citation?  Why not give a page where it could be shown what that author concluded?  Instead he just said, &quot;This is what it said in this book.&quot;  Well, as my anthro prof says, &quot;I can't be expected to read through a complete book just to confirm your reference.  Either include a complete reference or omit it, cause either one is better than a reference fragment.&quot;  I also said that the conclusion was reasonable based on the biology portion of the paper.  It's not me that brought the physics side into the discussion, it was Dawkins who chose to include that aspect.  <br>

yes, but the bigger question would be why a non-theist (a.k.a. atheist) be defending theism, magic/k/e, superstition, religion etc. at all? It was my understanding that you call yourself a &quot;naturalistic theist&quot; and yet now you refer to yourself as a non-theist. This is where the whole damn thread went funky...you keep switching sides and changing your story, what you are and what you believe.<br>

No, actually I decided part way through my engineering degree that I hated engineering.  Since I needed a degree to be eligible for medicine, so I stuck it out in engineering.  <br>
<br>
Finally,<br>
I tried to explain this earlier, but none of you seem to have understood.  Thus I will try to explain it again.  I came to a new site, and found out that no one here had heard of me.  Most of the places I go, my reputation precedes me, and because of that it is rare for a theist to engage in a religious discussion with me.  As of that time, I had never tried to discuss the topic from a theist point of view, so I tried it.(I thought it was pretty evident that I was new to the theistic side of the argument.)  As I continued this, I realized the lower mental effort required to argue this point was therapeutic to my problem of insomnia.  This is the reason that I continued for so long.  Recently, I realized that although I was getting better sleep, I was also betraying the person that I was.  Thus I've been trying to slowly work my way from the person that I was attempting to be, to the person that I am.(or will be from your POV, as the transition hasn't been completed.)  <br>
<br>
That being said, DBC, I guess 1.5 out of 3 isn't bad.  Yes, I'm sleep deprived, I exhibit the characteristics of an ADD, yet the doctors have diagnosed that it is not actually ADD, and I am not schizophrenic.<br>
<br>
Oh, and...<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and you didn't know he was never going to actually reply to you<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Funny, that's the behavior I've developed about some of you.  You in particular sometimes reply to my posts, but sometimes reply to a straw man* instead.  DL, for some reason, has been fighting straw men ever since I introduced that cheap parlor trick.  ST is probably the one of you three that I have the most admiration for.  She seems to approach these discussions with a logical and level head.<br>
<br>
*Straw man: also known as a straw man logical fallacy, is when a person creates an argument for them to dispute, in the attempt to make it seem that they are trying to dispute their opposition's actual argument.  In that person's mind, defeating the straw man is equivalent to defeating the original argument. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 313<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/26/03 4:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=214.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   A note of thanks...</span><hr size=1> Thank you Pheonix for confirming my diagnosis.<br>

You're right, I did introduce the concept of magick, but that was discussing the topic of the existance of deities.  Once we crossed the threshold from discussing the deities to discussing the magic trick, I stopped discussing magick, as I did not want to imply a connection.  Before I continue further on the topic of the suprnatural, I would like to know your opinion on something.  Do you believe that the natural and supernatural are mutually exclusive?  That is, can something be both supernatural and natural at the same time?(While answering the question, assume that there is such a thing as the supernatural)<br>

Actually, the only place I heard of the tooth fairy before was in the movie Darkness Falls.  Since hollywood tends to misportray, well most things, I did not expect that discription to be accurate.  As far as Santa Claus, Pere Noel or Kris Kringle, yes I've heard of him.  I put it to you that he is more of an ideal than an actual being.  Does a man live in the north pole who delivers presents to all the good little boys and girls of the world?  If one exists, he would have to have extremely advanced technology to overcome specific problems.  One of note would be centripital acceleration.  IMHO, as many religious icons, he is simply a personification of qualities within humans that are admirable, who has been twisted and corrupted by unscrupulous people.(i.e. religious leaders who mislead their followers, and stores who use the concept of giving to further their bottom line.)   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doublelatte>Double Latte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Got Milk?</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/27/03 8:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=214.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A note of thanks...</span><hr size=1> I just asked you to substantiate your straw man accusation, not piss and moan about every time I inserted a wee bit of irony or sarcasm into a post... so therefore I will only respond the statements you claim are &quot;straw men.&quot;<br>

That was sarcasm, in reference to your carrying on earnestly in a diffent post about low magick and high magick - all of which I thought was quite silly and couldn't resist poking fun at. Not a strawman though.  <br>

Okay, so are you saying that no one can ever validly argue anything that is not within their area of expertise? If so, I still disagree. Dawkins is a biologist who writes about evolution, he shouldn't have to be a physicist for any statement he makes in that realm to be valid. By the very standard you seem to be setting up here, YOU are unqualified to dismiss Dawkins essay as &quot;weak&quot; because you are neither a biologist nor a physicist.<br>

Well, if it were a strawman, it wouldn't be &quot;another straw man&quot; would it? It would be the very same one you try to make a case for above (the one that was actually just sarcasm - and anybody here who knows me knows I am sarcastic, so this isn't revisionism.) <br>
<br>
HOWEVER, when you first described the trick, you made the following statements &quot;as far as the laws of physics, the jury is still out on that one.&quot; (Later, realizing that statement lost you credibility you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>claimed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> this was meant as &quot;satire&quot;) You then described the levitation, (never mentioning <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>who</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was standing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>where</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, never labelling the person holding the coin as &quot;the assistant&quot; - and I digress but in stage magic, Stacey's description of the girl in the glittering thong is the &quot;assistant&quot; role - the person from the audience is usually called a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>volunteer.)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Then you gave &quot;telekenetics&quot; as a leading theory. Now you want to revise this and make it sound like all along, you believed it was a merely a simple parlor trick and you merely wanted help to figure it out.

Then you're earnestly putting forth &quot;telekenetics&quot; as a &quot;leading theory&quot; then going back and claiming you never said the coin levitation was anything more than a cheap parlor trick. <br>

If you wanted help figuring out your friend's parlor trick, you could have saved us a lot of time and misunderstandings by wording it this way:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I need help figuring out my friend's coin trick. It appears to defy the laws of physics, but of course I know that's impossible. Does anyone know the secret to this trick? Here's how it works: <br>
<br>
Before starting the trick, my friend has <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>everyone</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> back up <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>at least two meters</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> away from his volunteer <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>before</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> asking the volunteer to pull his/her own coin out of his/her own pocket. (He had me do it once, so I'm prety sure it's not a trick coin.) Then, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>without anyone except the holder of the coin touching the coin or even getting any closer than two meters to the coin,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> my friend stares at it from that distance. After about twenty seconds of staring, the coin seems to levitate out of the volunteer's hand, hover at about a foot over the volunteer's hand, and slowly begin to increase its angular velocity.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (Sorry I don't know how to clarify what you meant by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>angular velocity</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is - sounds like it's speeding up at an angle - but it's probably irrelevent anyway.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>My physics professor's theory is that it's telekenetics, but I know that's bunk and since he's a physics professor, I presume he was joking when he gave that ridiculous theory. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Another friend thinks it's a magnetic field generator[/b] that is capable of generating a field that is so powerful, yet so precise that it can draw up the coin without making my credit cards useless. My problem with that theory is I've never even heard of such a device.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Anyone know how this trick is done?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Now, if you had put it that way, no one would have mistaken you for a frosted flake. You would have been treated with a lot more respect. Now, listen again to how you actually put it:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>as far as the laws of physics, the jury's still out on that one.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I'm currently trying to understand how my friend's trick works. What he does is he has someone take a simple coin out of their pocket and place it in their palm. He then proceeds to stare at it and after about twenty seconds the coin seems to levitate out of the person's hand, hover at about a foot over the person's hand, and slowly begin to increase it's angular velocity. I'm pretty sure that it's not a trick coin since one time he asked me to be the one to pull a coin out of my pocket. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Currently the two leading theories that have been presented to me are: 1)Telekinetic ability, and 2)A magnetic field generator</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that is capable of generating a field that is so powerful, yet so precise that it can draw up the coin without making my bank and credit cards useless. Obviously both theories have their faults, so if you could provide a more plausible explanation I'd be glad to hear it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Later, you made the following statement about magic:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And just so you know, magic will never die until the very last stage preformer is dead, and magick will live till the last wiccan falls from this mortal coil.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Several important and impressive aspects of the trick (2 meters away, no one else near the coin but the holder, never any physical contact between magician and coin) you sat on until it became necessary to reveal them in order to debunk various theories.<br>
<br>
So, lets add it up shall we?<br>
The jury is still out on the laws of physics + telekenetic ability is a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>leading theory</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> + <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>magick will live </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> till the last wiccan falls from this mortal coil = <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>flighty, illogical thinking.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
No mention of impressive key aspects of trick until required to debunk various theories + calling yourself a theist then a non-theist, saying you were only pretending to be a theist = <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>your position in a constant state a flux as convenient for you... in laymen's terms <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>jerking us around</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Thanks for all the laughs Pheonix.  Your ignorant egotism has been entertaining.  Your circular run from sneering at atheism to admitting you were an atheist was amusing.  Your smug pride in how awesome your mind is was likewise, amusing to say the least.  Your confident identification of what a pregnant teen feels speaks well of your juvinile nature, as does the idiotic concept you put forth that there was a third option excluding you from the belief/disbelief dichotomy.  It is no wonder that your belief system is as fickle as your arguments and changes from second to second, or that you are so lacking in friends you have to pretend to a religion to find any.  Perhaps you will enroll in a class on logical argumentation and debate structures (obviously not under those pathetic caricatures you cited earlier as debatants) and learn a bit about how to debate and what those buzz words you bandy about actually mean.  Hopefully, you will hold true to your promises that you'd leave, you can't stand it here, you are bored, you are not posting again.  Whatever.<br>

By the very standard you seem to be setting up here, YOU are unqualified to dismiss Dawkins essay as &quot;weak&quot; because you are neither a biologist nor a physicist.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Three problems, <br>
1) this is a straw man fallacy because you misrepresented my position by only taking into consideration that one part that you bolded.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How can we get your position right if you can't even do that?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I could go through the posts and count the number of times that I said in plain english what my position was,(as this was related to the parlor trick) however, that would take up too much of my time.(As if this whole conversation hasn't already.)<br>

Regular medicine- the practice of assisting the body to return to homeostasis once it has left that state.<br>
Holistic medicine- the practice of using adjustments in a person's lifestyle to assist the body in maintaining homeostasis.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>prove a negative? What are you totally ignorant of the rules of logic and debate?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You couldn't disprove a positive.  That is what I was asking you to do, disprove that little thing that is called a soul.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guess you ARE totally ignorant of the rules of logic and debate.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Really?  Well, here's the definition of an appeal to ignorance fallacy.(Page 189 of the same book listed above.)<br>
An argument exemplifies a fallacious appeal to ignorance if and only if the premises describe ignorance, lack of confirmation, lack of proof, or uncertainty regarding a statement 'S'; and a conclusion about the truth or falsity or probability or improbability of 'S', or a further statement, is inferred simply on the basis of this ignorance.  From ignorance we can infer only lack of knowledge.  We cannot infer truth or falsity or objective probability or improbability.<br>
Thus my statement &quot;Lack of evidence for something does not constitute evidence opposed. That would constitute an appeal to ignorance.&quot; was completely in line with the rules of logic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sarcasm = straw man? I don't think so!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Ah yes, the female perspective.  That the only part men play until the child arrives is the donation of sperm.  And you call me self absorbed.<br>

As far as your conclusion... Well, I guess everything's been covered, no need to restate things more than I have.<br>
