Now, I don't want to get into a debate here, but I do want to post a remark to your comment about Paul. The Greek *whips out Strong's* allows for the fact that rising up means &quot;c) to leave a place to go elsewhere.&quot; However, I don't think that baptism by submersion is a necessary teaching though I believe that it obviously identifies us with Christ in a most complete way. Now, I hope it was obvious from my case that I was talking about baptism by water, and this being the most commonly referred to baptism, that was the one I was going for. &quot;What baptism is,&quot; I interpretted to mean the process...<br>

<br>
However, I interpreted his/her comments as a direct afront to my beliefs. Looking back perhaps they were not intended to be so, but I maintain that my interpretation is really the only method of interpreting the comments at that time. What we apparently had was a strong mis-communication.<br>
<br>
You must understand, I have experienced statements like this before,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Personally, I don't need a Catholic dictionary to define baptism. It seems quite clear what the Bible says.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
and given the context, I think my definition of it as &quot;anti-intellectual pride&quot; is accurate from my interpretation of what you meant. You seemed to have off-handedly dismissed the scholarship I was presenting. I really can't be certain if it was &quot;pride&quot; that makes you do this (or ignorance, or a familiarity with the topic), but from a Catholic perspective, the protestant notion of sola scriptura is rooted in pride (the &quot;I don't need anyones help, I know religion&quot; attitude (which incidently mirrors your statement almost verbatum)). Pride is the opposite of humble submission/obedience.<br>
<br>
As for my comments about pride and strenuous activity (reading an article), it really gets my goat when someone dismisses an entire article for no good reason other than, &quot;I already know, I don't need anyone to help me&quot; which I (mistakenly) thought you were espousing. That to me is the pinnacle of pride, the attitude that scholarship is useless and thus I don't need to inform myself because I already know. How much better the world would be if that attitude was eradicated.<br>
<br>
my comment:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Better hop into the BBQ darkhamster to get baptized.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Was obviously intended tongue in cheek. Matthew clearly says Jesus will come baptizing &quot;in the Holy Ghost and fire.&quot; This was an attempt to show that, contrary to darkmaster's claims, the Bible is not &quot;clear&quot; on what baptism is. I would hate to think of some fundamentalist biblical literalists burning themselves in the name of the Father and Son and Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
But I have mentioned context a few times, and the first set of statements I would probably not have interpreted so harshly if they were not followed by what I perceived as a non sequitor attack directed against the Catholic Church, <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Notice that Jesus &quot;went up&quot; out of the water. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>This rules out</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> so-called sprinkling.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I now realize (or I hope) that Darkmaster was not intending to question the validity of Catholic baptism (despite using the strong language &quot;rules out&quot;), but when I wrote my response I thought he was. Seeing that baptism is necessary for salvation (or isn't, I'll wait for the end of the debate<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) I think it rather an afront to me personally and my Church in general when someone says that none of us are saved because our baptisms were not valid. A quick google search of this topic shows an incredible amount of literature dedicated to claiming that Catholics are going to hell because we &quot;sprinkle&quot; during baptism. Darkmaster just happened (accidentally it seems) upon a topic which I happened to know leads to rather unpleasant conversation at best. I wanted to quickly disprove the argument about baptism by immersion to prevent it from escalating. It is good to hear Darkmaster clearify his position, that immersion is not necessary for a valid baptism: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I don't think that baptism by submersion is a necessary teaching though I believe that it obviously identifies us with Christ in a most complete way<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
True. I like the symbolism too, but I think the argument that it is necessary to baptism would be like saying, &quot;it is necessary to have wine at a wedding for the marriage to be valid, because at the wedding at Cana there was wine and that best associates us with the Gospel account of weddings&quot; A rediculous argument as you can see.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;What baptism is,&quot; I interpretted to mean the process... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
See, as I intended it literally as &quot;what is baptism&quot; (not &quot;how to baptize&quot;), I though that your statement flowed from a less than latent anti-catholicism. It is an argument frequently used by Fundamentalists of a nasty sort and to me, it was a non-sequitor point (did not follow) from what we were talking about...I interpreted it as a last jibe against Catholicism rather than part of the conversation. That is why I reacted rather harshly.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I behave as a bull in a china shop, I think here is a good example of me jumping to conclusions, then trying to fill a tea cup with a firehose.<br>

I know it is common practise to jump when 'debating', that's why the forum was created for it, so it would be monitored closely.  There will not be any denominational bashing here.  But please realize some statements may be made unintentionally, whether by inexperience with other denominations, or other possible reasons, and possibly without knowing they are stepping on anyone's toes.<br>

If there is a problem, or you have a question about a statement, feel free to ask kindly of the other poster what they meant.  Or to offer help in an explanation is always useful.  It can be done. I'd love for this board to become the example instead of what seems to be the rule out on the net where debates are concerned.  <br>
I love you all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :gp --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/grouphug2.gif ALT=":gp"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

God bless,<br>

It does seem like my original post could be construed to the point of denomination bashing. I was simply preluding my point with the fact that I was simply going straight from the Bible, not from an outside source. That is something I think is absolutely crucial to Christian debate. I judge everything from the Bible. This was not meant to be an attack on the source Adam posted. I think that this was simply the result of my misinterpretation of Adam's first post and the question he was asking. <br>
<br>
On a separate note, I should be posting the next part of the debate tomorrow... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amarischuk>amarischuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#B87333>(10/16/03 7:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My apologies...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm here to tell you that you have to dispel of your experience in other Christian forums when posting here; I have made it my vow to maintain a Christ-like environment here <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
very nice, but remember: Christ also liked a good debate...but then again, he also always won.<br>
<br>
I think I would like debating a lot more if I always won too.<br>
<br>
I agree with what seems to be universal consensus that the official debating should take place in the formalized debate section. <br>
<br>
I am reminded of that Simpsons where Homer goes around slapping people with a glove and saying, &quot;I demand satisfaction&quot;...until someone takes him up on the duel. <br>
<br>
Next time I get the itch, I will simply post: Sir (or Ma'm), I demand satisfaction<br>
<br>
However, I am a little curious when simple disagreement should become a debate. For instance when does disagreement over something become a debate. When does correcting somebody become a debate<br>
<br>
eg. &quot;My favorite song is Cats in the Craddle written by Cat Stevens&quot;<br>
<br>
responce, &quot;Harry Chapin wrote Cats in the Craddle, though Cat Steven's version is very nice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, I doubt most people would think THIS disagreement is worthy of jousting over (but it is a common misconception).<br>
<br>

Infact, should this post be moved to the debate section? anyone want to debate the rules for what demands a debate? hehe.<br>

I think that pretty much anything is debatable, if only for the sake of debating. There have been several times that I've debated someone I agree with (i.e. devil's advocate) for the sake of seeing why someone else believes that idea. It can be very stimulating and can even strengthen your faith and reasoning skills when confronted by a non-christian about what you believe and why. It is more of a brain exercise than anything else, like a massive chess games put to words. &quot;We meet on the field of honor...&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :shsm --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/sheildsmile.gif ALT=":shsm"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.- Jim Eliot</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heartjoys>heartjoys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=purple><b>Velvet-Steel Wannabe</b></font></span><br>  Posts: 1502<br> <font color=#B87333>(10/17/03 7:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/CladdaghAward.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :g4 --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/g4.gif ALT=":g4"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I not only think it's ironic, I think it's quite funny...<br>
<br>
It speaks of another reason why I like these discussion boards- it's also an interesting study in human nature <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

See how quick we are to type and share our thoughts, and maybe not fully read someone else's posts?  But, when we are going to be fully accountable for each word we say, how we say it, when we say it, etc. much more is considered.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
