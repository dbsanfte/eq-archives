<br>
 [Xera still narrates]<br>
<br>
I arrived home very tired ready to hit the pillow. But instead of him being sleep he’s awake. Laying in bed with that ‘where have you been all night and why didn’t you tell me you were going out’ look. I didn’t need this tonight. I didn’t have the time to argue with this one. Good thing I changed before I got here.<br>
<br>
“Where did you go?” He started off as if he was about to cry all over my two-hundred dollar shoes.<br>
<br>
“I went out. Is that a crime?”I replied not even looking at his expression. I just started taking off my clothes.<br>
<br>
“Why do you always leave at night? What are you hiding? Stop playing with me, woman!.” He  tried to raise he voice shaky and unsure of himself. I didn’t see this one coming. His balls were beginning to form. I looked at him in the mirror, simply smiling. I wanted to know where this was going to lead.<br>
“What!? Do you find this a joke? It’s not funny. You f**k me and then leave. I’m not your @#%$ toy. Just tell me where you went. That’s all. Why can’t you just be honest with me for once in our relationship?” He was fully aroused, but still a little above a whisper, standing on his side of the bed.<br>
<br>
“Oh come on Michael. You know that you are my one and only toy. Stop this and come to bed. I’m tired and you’re obviously going through some sort of male PMS.” I waved him off, snuggling in on my side of the bed with my back to him.<br>
<br>
“You know.........You know what.......The hell with you!” He grabbed his clothes and stormed out. I knew where he was going but he was the last thing on my mind.<br>
<br>
 ***** 8:04 pm***** (Sam’s job -The Inn - Bar&amp;Grill)<br>
<br>
“I just don’t know what happened Meme. I was on my way from the bar and I saw all this smoke and then I remembered you being in there sleep. I was so worried. Why didn’t you call me and tell me you were alright.” Sam related to me. She was so distraught with tears that I felt so bad for being so naive.<br>
<br>
“I couldn’t remember what happened. I woke up in all this haze and must have been having a bad dream. I wasn’t in the apartment when it caught on fire. Xera told me that I came home very tired and I went right to bed.”<br>
<br>
“What are you talking about? Meme I left you there around 2:00. You couldn’t have left. You were like drop dead Fred. You were snoring and everything. Besides when I got back, your car was still down the block. The fire didn’t start until around 3:00. I know you. You sleep like a log.” Now that I think about it, Sam had a point.<br>
<br>
I was so confused that I almost cried. I felt like that little boy who gets separated from his mommy. In my mind I wanted to believe Xera but my heart told me that she would just lie again. Why would she want to do such a thing? All of Sam’s possessions were in that little apartment. She was staying in a shelter until she got another apartment. I felt like a fool. Now I remembered the smoke. I remembered Janet’s warning after I passed out from all the smoke in my lungs.<br>
<br>
There was a need for witnesses. It seemed no one saw anything that day out of the ordinary. It was as if the building just went up inflames by itself. The police had no leads and the firemen had no clue as to how the blaze got started.<br>
<br>
I walked Sam after she had closed up for the night. I hated for her to be sleeping in that damned section 8 house but she insisted she was fine. As I walked from the house I arrived at Sam’s building. Black ashes grazed the side walk and street. Michael continued to try to remember but it seemed as if he was in this big dream world.<br>
<br>
He finally reached the condo and found a car outside. He had seen this car before but paid no attention to it. He caught the elevator up to the third to last floor and noticed a light coming from Xera’s room. He heard different types of sounds and decided to wait in the corner of the floor to see who was there. At first he thought it may have been a robber but who he saw coming out that apartment nearly made him have a heart attack.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp [Michael narrates]<br>
<br>
“So um when do you think I could come back and........” He was cut off by Xera.”<br>
<br>
“Well I’m sure I can get Michael away for a while and then you and I can talk some more.” Xera kissed his cheek.<br>
<br>
“Well what are you doing tonight? Why must I leave so early. We were having so much fun.”<br>
<br>
“Michael should be coming in soon and I don’t want him to get the wrong idea.. I mean what do you think he’d think if he saw you. I think you ought to go. But you call me if you need anymore favors.” She licked her lips coyly.<br>
<br>
I sat by peaking around the corner. My heart was broken. All these years I thought that Xera couldn’t be anymore deceitful. All the times she accused me of cheating on her with Sam and any other female that came across my path. All the times I sat waiting by the phone to hear her voice echo in my ear and bounce in my soul and I find her cheating on me with no less then my own father<br>
<br>
<br>
“Joseph, how dare you even show your face.” I was so mad/sad that I must have been thinking aloud and they heard me.<br>
<br>
“Michael. So how long were you standing there.......” Joseph responded as if nothing had happened.<br>
<br>
I didn’t know what to say or do. I felt like just punching him in his f**king face. I felt like taking a f**king knife and killing them both. First Mother dies then Janet. And now my damn girlfriend was sneaking around with my old a$$ father. How sick can life get after this?!!!<br>
<br>
I walked slowly toward him and.................<br>
