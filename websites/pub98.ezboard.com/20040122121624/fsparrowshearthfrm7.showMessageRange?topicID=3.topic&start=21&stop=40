FORMED FOR GOD’S FAMILY<br>
<br>
His unchanging plan has always been to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ.  Ephesians 1:5 NLT<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: I was formed for God’s family.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  How can I start treating other believers like members of my own family?  What could I do today?<br>
<br>
God wants a family, and he created you to be a part of it.  This is God’s second purpose for your life, which he planned before you were born.  The entire Bible is the story of God building a family who will love him, honor him, and reign with him forever.<br>
<br>
His unchanging plan has always been to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ.  And this gave him great pleasure.  Ephesians 1:5 NLT<br>
<br>
The moment you were spiritually born into God’s family, you were given some astounding birthday gifts: the family name, the family likeness, family privileges, family intimate access, and the family inheritance!  As children in God’s family we are given: the riches…of his grace…kindness…patience…glory…wisdom…power…and mercy (Ephesians 1:7; Romans 2:4, 9:23, 11:33, Ephesians 3:16, 2:4).  We also inherit eternal life.  What an inheritance!  You are far richer than you realize.<br>
<br>
God has reserved a priceless inheritance for his children, it is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay. I Peter 1:4 NLT<br>
<br>
Jesus and the people he makes holy all belong to the same family.  That is why he isn’t ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.  Hebrews 2:11 CEV<br>
<br>
Because Jesus makes you holy, God is proud of you.  Being included in God’s family is the highest honor, the greatest privilege you and I will ever receive.  Nothing else comes close.  Why not pause right now and thank God that he included you!<br>
<br>
Thank you dear God, that you made me to be a part of your family forever!  What a privilege it is to be included.  Help me to never take your church for granted.<br>

WHAT MATTERS MOST<br>
<br>
The entire law is summed up in a single command.  “Love your neighbor as yourself.”  Galatians 5:14<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: Life is all about love.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Honestly, are relationships the top priority in my life?  How could I insure that they are?<br>
<br>
Since God is love, the most important lesson he wants you to learn on earth is how to love.  It is in loving that we are most like him, so love is the foundation of every command he’s given us.  God wants us to love everyone, but he is particularly concerned that we learn to love others in his family.  This is the second purpose of your life and it’s called fellowship.  Jesus said our love for each other is our greatest witness to the world.<br>
<br>
No matter what I say, what I believe, and what I do, I’m bankrupt without love.  I Corinthians 13:3 MSG<br>
<br>
The best use of your life is love.  It should be your top priority, your primary objective, your greatest ambition.  Love is not a good part of your life, it’s the most important part.  Relationships must have first place in your life above everything else.  Why?  God gives us three reasons: life, without love is really worthless; love will last forever, and love is what you’ll be evaluated on in eternity.  Jesus summarized what matters most to God in two statements: love God and love people.<br>
<br>
Let love be your greatest aim. I Corinthians 14:1 LB<br>
<br>
Our love should not be just words and talk; it must be true love, which shows itself in action. I John 3:18 TEV<br>
<br>
The best expression of love is time.  Time is your most precious gift because you only have a set amount of it.  You can make more money but you can’t make more time.  When you give someone your time, you are giving them a portion of your life that you’ll never get back.  Your time is your life.  That’s why the greatest gift you can give someone is your time.  Whenever you give your time you’re making a sacrifice, and sacrifice is the essence of love.<br>
<br>
Whenever we have the opportunity we should do good to everyone. Galatians 6:10 NLT<br>
<br>
The best time to love is now.  You don’t know how long you’ll have the opportunity to express love.  Circumstances change.  People die.  Children grow up.  You have no guarantee of tomorrow.  If you want to express love you’d better do it now.<br>
<br>
Father, help me to remember that life is all about love.  Today I will take the time to love the people you place in my path.  Remind me that loving others is never a waste of time.  Teach me to love those who seem unlovable and give them what they need, not what they deserve.<br>

A PLACE TO BELONG<br>
<br>
In Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.  Romans 12:5<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  I’m called to belong, not just believe.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Does my level of involvement in my church demonstrate that I love and am committed to God’s family?<br>
<br>
Even in the perfect, sinless environment of Eden God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone” (Genesis 2:18).  We’re created for community, fashioned for fellowship, formed for a family, and none of us can fulfill God’s purposes by ourselves.  While your relationship to Christ is personal, God never intends it to be private.  In God’s family you’re connected to every other believer, and we’ll belong to each other for eternity.  You are members of God’s very own family, citizens of God’s country, and you belong in God’s household with every other Christian (Ephesians 2:19 LB).<br>
<br>
To Paul, being a member of the church meant being a vital organ of a living body, an indispensable, interconnected part of the body of Christ.  We need to recover and practice the biblical meaning of membership.  The church is a body, not a building; an organism, not an organization.  You were created for a specific role in Christ’s body, but you’ll miss this second purpose of your life if you’re not attached to a living, local church.  We discover our role in life through our relationships with others and significance comes, not from within yourself, but from being a part of Christ’s body.<br>
<br>
The local church is the classroom for the learning how to get along in God’s family.  It is a lab for practicing love.  Only in regular contact with ordinary imperfect believers can we learn real fellowship, and experience the New Testament truth of being connected and dependent on each other.  True fellowship is being as committed to each other as we are to Jesus Christ.  And when we come together in love as a church family from different backgrounds, race, and social status it is a witness to the world.<br>
<br>
Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples.  John 13:35 NLT<br>
<br>
You need a purpose to live for, people to live with, principles to live by, a profession to live out, and a power to live on.  God intends for his church to provide these.  In fact, the five purposes of the church are identical to God’s five purposes for your life.  Worship helps you focus on God; fellowship helps you face life’s problems; discipleship helps fortify your faith; ministry helps find your talents; evangelism helps fulfill your mission.  There is nothing on earth like the church!<br>
<br>
Dear God, help me to remember that whenever I become careless about fellowship with other believers, I’m moving away from you.  Forgive me for the times I’ve gotten detached from your Body, the church.  Help me to stay connected and committed, and love your church the way you do.<br>

EXPERIENCING LIFE TOGETHER<br>
<br>
Share each other’s troubles and problems, and in this way obey the law of Christ.  Galatians 6:2 NLT<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  I need others in my life.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What one step could I take today to connect with another believer at a more genuine, heart to heart level?<br>
<br>
God intends for us to weave our lives together.  The Bible calls this fellowship.  Fellowship is experiencing life together.  That includes unselfish loving, honest sharing, practical serving, sacrificial giving, sympathetic comforting, and all the other “one another” commands found in the New Testament.  When it comes to fellowship size matters, smaller is better.  Every Christian needs to be involved in a small group within your church, whether it is a home fellowship group, Sunday school class, or a small Bible study.  This is where real community take place.<br>
<br>
We experience authenticity in genuine fellowship.  Fellowship is not superficial, surface-level interaction.  It’s genuine, sometimes gut-level sharing.  It happens when people honestly share themselves - their thoughts, feeling, doubts, fears, strengths, and weaknesses.  Of course, this is quite a risk, requiring both courage and humility.  It means facing our fear of exposure, rejection, and being hurt again.  Why would anyone take such a risk?  Because it is the only way to grow spiritually.<br>
<br>
Make this your common practice.  Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you can live together whole and healed.  James 5:16 MSG<br>
<br>
We experience mutuality and sympathy in genuine fellowship.  Mutuality is the art of giving and receiving.  It’s depending on each other.  Mutuality is the heart of fellowship: building reciprocal relationships, sharing responsibilities, and helping each other.  Sympathy is understanding and affirming someone’s feelings.  It meets two fundamental human needs, the need to be understood and the need to have your feelings validated.  Sympathy says, “I know what you’re going through and what you feel is neither strange nor crazy.”  Sympathy is entering in and sharing the pain.<br>
<br>
Share each other’s troubles and problems, and in this way obey the law of Christ. Galatians 6:2 NLT<br>
<br>
How wonderful it is, how pleasant, for God’s people to live together in harmony!  Psalm 133:1 TEV<br>
<br>
We experience mercy in genuine fellowship.  It’s a place of grace, where your mistakes aren’t rubbed in but rubbed out.  Fellowship and forgiveness go together.  Because we’re all imperfect, sinful people we hurt each other sometimes intentionally and sometimes unintentionally.  That means we need massive amounts of mercy and grace in order to live together.  We need to offer it and receive it.  Fellowship happens when mercy sins over justice.<br>
<br>
Father, I want you to use me to help build real fellowship in my church.  Help me to be authentic with others and not wear a mask.  Teach me to show sympathy to them who are hurting and offer mercy to those who have stumbled.<br>

CULTIVATING COMMUNITY<br>
<br>
We understand what love is when we realize that Christ gave his life for us.  That means we must give our lives for other believers.  I John 3:16 GW<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: Community requires commitment.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  How could I help cultivate the characteristics of real community in my small group and church?<br>
<br>
To help build genuine fellowship in your church or small group, you must make the effort to do five things: be honest, be humble, be courteous, respect confidentiality, and have frequent, regular contact with others.  Relationships take time and effort, but the benefits far outweigh the costs and Jesus expects us to love each other the way he loves us.<br>
<br>
You can develop a healthy, robust community that lives right with God and enjoy its results only if you do the hard work of getting along with each other, treating each other with dignity and honor.  James 3:18 MSG<br>
<br>
Make the effort to be humble and courteous.  Humility is the oil that smoothes and soothes relationships.  The Bible says in I Peter 5:5, Clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.  Courtesy is showing respect for our differences and being considerate even when we disagree with each other.  Paul told Titus that there should be “no insults, no fights.  God’s people should be bighearted and courteous.”  We all have peculiar quirks and annoying traits.  But community has nothing to do with compatibility.  The basis for our fellowship is our relationship to God; we’re family.<br>
<br>
Let us not give up the habit of meeting together, as some are doing.  Instead, let us encourage one another.  Hebrews 10:25 REV<br>
<br>
Deep fellowship is built with confidentiality.  Only in the safe environment of warm acceptance and trusted confidentiality will people open up and share their deepest hurts, needs, and mistakes.  Confidentiality means that what is shared in your group needs to stay in your group.  Also, deep fellowship is built with frequency.  You must have frequent, regular contact with your group in order to build genuine fellowship with them.  Fellowship requires an investment of your time.  Real fellowship takes effort.<br>
<br>
God, help me not to settle for superficial relationships with other believers.  Help me connect to a small group of believers in my church where I can learn what real love is all about.<br>
<br>

The Bible calls this fellowship. Fellowship is experiencing life together. That includes unselfish loving, honest sharing, practical serving, sacrificial giving, sympathetic comforting, and all the other “one another” commands found in the New Testament. When it comes to fellowship size matters, smaller is better. Every Christian needs to be involved in a small group within your church, whether it is a home fellowship group, Sunday school class, or a small Bible study. This is where real community take place.<br>
<br>
We experience authenticity in genuine fellowship. Fellowship is not superficial, surface-level interaction. It’s genuine, sometimes gut-level sharing. It happens when people honestly share themselves - their thoughts, feeling, doubts, fears, strengths, and weaknesses. Of course, this is quite a risk, requiring both courage and humility. It means facing our fear of exposure, rejection, and being hurt again. Why would anyone take such a risk? Because it is the only way to grow spiritually.<br>
<br>
Make this your common practice. Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you can live together whole and healed. James 5:16 MSG<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I know I'm getting quite a bit of confirmation in what I've been taught through the years with this study.  I'm so glad you are enjoying it too!  The last 2 days have really hit home for me.  I have friends that when we are apart it seems like no time at all, the comfort level is there regardless of the time that has past.  Then I have old enduring friendships I wouldn't trade for the world.  And now I have you, Femme, Wearynot and Peaches especially, among others, that I have sprouted a friendship with that I'm expecting to become one of those long enduring ones. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm also realizing how much these friendships mean to me, how complacent I've become about some of them, and how truly precious they are.  Regardless of whether being online or not, when you interact with another person who is Christian it becomes fellowship, it's just another wonderful level to explore.  It's so neat how God works all of this out!!  Truly I've been blessed and I hope others are blessed too through the fellowship that is established. <br>

RESTORING BROKEN FELLOWSHIP<br>
<br>
Do everything possible on your part to live in peace with everybody.  Romans 12:18 TEV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  Relationships are always worth restoring.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Who do I need to restore a broken relationship with today?<br>
<br>
Jesus said, “God blesses those who work for peace, for they will be called the children of God” (Matthew 5:9 NLT).  If you want God’s blessing in your life, and you want to be known as a child of God, you must learn to be a peacemaker.  Since you were formed to be a part of God’s family and the third purpose of your life on earth is to learn how to love and relate to others, peacemaking is one of the most important skills you can develop.  God has restored our relationship with him through Christ, and has given us this ministry of restoring relationships (II Corinthians 5:18 GW).<br>
<br>
Peacemaking is not avoiding conflict.  Jesus, the Prince of Peace, was never afraid of conflict.  On occasion, he provoked it for the good of everyone.  Sometimes we need to avoid conflict, sometimes we need to create it, and sometimes we need to resolve it.  That’s why we must pray for the Holy Spirit’s continual guidance.  Peacemaking is also not appeasement.  Always giving in, acting like a doormat, and allowing others to always run over you is not what Jesus had in mind.  Christ refused to back down on many issues, standing his ground in the face of evil opposition.<br>
<br>
As believers, God has called us to settle our relationships with each other.  II Corinthians 5:18 MSG<br>
<br>
Here are seven biblical steps to restoring fellowship:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Talk to God before talking to the person.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Always take the initiative.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sympathize with their feeling.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Confess my part of the conflict.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Attack the problem, not the person.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cooperate as much as possible.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emphasize reconciliation, not resolution.<br>
<br>
Who do you need to contact as result of this chapter?  With whom do you need to restore fellowship?  Don’t delay another second.  Pause right now and talk to God about that person.  Then pick up the phone and begin the process.  These seven steps are simple but they are not easy.  It takes a lot of effort to restore a relationship.  That’s why Peter urged, “Work hard at living in peace with others” (I Peter 3:11 NLT).  But when you work for peace you’re doing what God would do.  That’s why God calls peacemakers his children.<br>
<br>
Father, give me clear vision to see how to best restore a broken relationship.  I need wisdom, humility, love, and courage to do the right thing and take the first step to restoration.<br>

PROTECTING YOUR CHURCH<br>
<br>
Let us concentrate on the things which make for harmony and the growth of our fellowship together.  Romans 14:19 PH<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  It’s my responsibility to protect the unity of the church.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What am I personally doing to protect the unity in my church family right now?<br>
<br>
God loves unity.  God desires us to experience oneness and harmony with each other.  The Trinity is unified and God wants us to be unified, too.  Our heavenly Father, like every parent, enjoys watching his children get along with each other.  Jesus, in his final moments before being arrested, prayed passionately for our unity.  And the Holy Spirit is the one who unites us in love.<br>
<br>
The group of believers were united in their hearts and spirit…  In fact, they shared everything.  Acts 4:32 NCV<br>
<br>
Nothing is more valuable to God than his church.  He paid the highest price for it, and it is worth protecting.  Part of your responsibility as a believer is to protect the unity where you fellowship.  You need to think of yourself as an agent of unity, commissioned by Jesus Christ to promote and preserve the fellowship among believers.<br>
<br>
Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.  Ephesians 4:3<br>
<br>
Here are some ways you can be an agent of unity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Focus on what we share in common, not our differences.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Be realistic in your expectations.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Choose to encourage rather than criticize.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Refuse to listen to gossip.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Support your pastor and leaders.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Practice God’s method for conflict resolution:<br>
<br>
If a fellow believer hurts you, go and tell him – work it out between the two of you.  If he listens, you’ve made a friend.   If he won’t listen, take one or two others along so that the presence of witnesses will keep things honest, and try again.  If he still won’t listen, tell the church. (Matthew 18:15-17 MSG).<br>
<br>
Don’t think only of your own good.  Think of other Christians and what is best for them. I Corinthians 10:24 NLT<br>
<br>
I challenge you to accept your responsibility to protect and promote the unity of your church.  Put your full effort into it and God will be pleased.  It will not always be easy.  Sometimes you’ll have to do what’s best for the body, not yourself, showing preference to others.  That’s one reason God puts us in a church family – to learn unselfishness.  In community we learn to say “we” instead of “I,” and “our” instead of “mine.”<br>
<br>
Father, I need your wisdom to act in ways that protect the unity of your church.  Help me to squelch gossip and instead be an encourager.  I want to be a unifier, not a divider.<br>

CREATED TO BECOME LIKE CHRIST<br>
<br>
As the Spirit of the Lord works within us, we become more and more like him and reflect his glory even more.  II Corinthians 3:18 NLT<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  I was created to become like Christ.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  In what area of my life do I need to ask for the Spirit’s power to be like Christ today?<br>
<br>
From the very beginning, God’s plan has been to make you like his Son, Jesus.  This is your destiny, and the third purpose of your life.  What does the full image and likeness of god look like?  It looks like Jesus Christ!  On earth, God’s ultimate goal for your life is not comfort, but Christ-like character.<br>
<br>
God knew what he was doing from the very beginning.  He decided from the outset to shape the lives of those who love him along the same lines as the life of his Son… We see the original and intended shape of our lives there in him.  Romans 8:29 MSG<br>
<br>
Only the Holy Spirit has the supernatural power to make the changes God wants to make in our lives.  This process is called sanctification.  It’s not a matter of trying really hard to be like Jesus, but trusting and listening to the Spirit, who lives inside us.  However, the Holy Spirit releases his power the moment you take a step of faith.  He waits for you to act first.  God also uses his Word, his people, and circumstances to mold us.  God’s Word provides the truth we need to grow, God’s people provide the support we need to grow, and the circumstances provide the environment to practice Christ-likeness. <br>
<br>
When he comes we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is.  I John 3:2 NLT<br>
<br>
Becoming like Christ is a long, slow process of growth.  Spiritual maturity is neither instant nor automatic; it is a gradual, progressive development that will take the rest of your life.  Our transformation into Christ-likeness will be completed when we get to heaven or when Jesus returns.  When we are finally able to see Jesus perfectly, we’ll become perfectly like him.  Jesus wants to make us like himself before he takes us to heaven.  This is our greatest privilege, our immediate responsibility, and our ultimate destiny.<br>
<br>
Jesus, I want to learn to think like you, speak like you, feel what you feel, and act the way you would act.  Please use your Words and your Spirit to make me like you.<br>

HOW WE GROW<br>
<br>
Let God transform you inwardly by a complete change of your mind.  Then you will be able to know the will of God – what is good and is pleasing to him and is perfect.  Romans 12:2 TEV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: It’s never too late to start growing.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What is one area where I need to stop thinking my way and start thinking God’s way?<br>
<br>
Your heavenly Father’s goal is for you to mature and develop the characteristics of Jesus Christ, living a life of love and humble service.  Spiritual growth is not automatic.  It takes an intentional commitment.  You must want to grow, decide to grow, make an effort to grow, and persist in growing.  Discipleship – the process of becoming like Christ – always begins with a decision.<br>
<br>
Once you decide to get serious about becoming like Christ, you must begin to act in new ways; You’ll need to let go of some old routines, develop some new habits, and intentionally change the way you think.<br>
<br>
There are two parts of spiritual growth: “work out” and “work in.”  The “work out” is your responsibility and the “work in” is God’s role.  Spiritual growth is a collaborative effort between you and the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
Continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and act according to his good purpose.  Philippians 2:12-13<br>
<br>
Let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think.  Romans 12:2 NLT<br>
<br>
Your first step in spiritual growth is to start changing the way you think.  The way you think determines the way you feel, and the way you find influences the way you act.  To be like Christ you must develop the mind of Christ.  The New Testament calls this mental shift ‘repentance,” which in Greek literally means “to change your mind.”  To repent means to change the way you think – about God, yourself, sin, other people, life, your future, and everything else.  You adopt Christ’s outlook and perspective on life.<br>
<br>
When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.  I Corinthians 13:11<br>
<br>
There are two parts to thinking like Jesus.  The first half of this mental shift is to stop thinking immature thoughts, which are self-centered and self-seeking.  The second half is to start thinking maturely, which focuses on others, not yourself.  Thinking of others is the heart of Christ-likeness, and the goal of spiritual growth.  This kind of thinking is unnatural, countercultural, and rare.  The only way we will learn to think this way is by filling our minds with the Word of God.<br>
<br>
Dear Father, I want to cooperate with your Spirit’s work in my life today.  Help me to listen to your teachings and develop my mind like Christ’s.<br>

TRANSFORMED BY TRUTH<br>
<br>
Jesus said, “If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”  John 8:31-32 KJV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: The truth transforms me.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What has God already told me to do in his Word that I haven’t started doing yet?<br>
<br>
The Spirit of God uses the Word of God to make us like the Son of God.  To become like Jesus, we must fill our lives with his Word.  God’s Word is the essential spiritual nourishment you must have to fulfill your purpose.  The Bible is called our milk, bread, solid food, and sweet dessert.  This four-course meal is the Spirit’s menu for spiritual strength and growth.  To be a healthy disciple of Jesus, feeding on God’s Word must be your first priority.  Jesus called it “abiding.”<br>
<br>
People need more than bread for their life, they must feed on every word of God. Matthew 4:4 NLT<br>
<br>
Abiding in God’s Word is a lifestyle that includes three daily decisions.  First, I must accept its authority.  The most important task you can do today is settle this issue of what’s going to be the ultimate authority for your life.  Decide that regardless of culture, tradition, reason, or emotion you choose the Bible as your final authority.  Determine to first ask, “What does the Bible say?” when making decisions.  Settle it in your mind that when God says to do something you’ll trust God’s Word and do it whether or not it makes sense, or if you feel like doing it.<br>
<br>
Every word of God is flawless.  Proverbs 30:5<br>
<br>
To abide in God’s Word I must assimilate its truth.  There are five ways to do this:<br>
1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Receive God’s Word – listen and accept it with an open, receptive attitude.<br>
2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp READ the Bible daily – it will keep you in range of God’s voice.<br>
3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Research or study the Bible, asking questions about the text and writing down your insights.<br>
4.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Remember it – memorizing Bible verses will help you resist temptation, make wise decisions, build confidence, offer good advice, and share your faith with others.<br>
5.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reflect daily on Scripture- there is no other habit that can do more to make you more like Jesus.<br>
<br>
Jesus said, “Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.” John 13:17<br>
<br>
To abide in God’s Word I must apply its principles.  I must become “a doer of the Word” (James 1:22 JKV).  God’s blessing comes from obeying the truth, not just knowing it.  The best way to become a “doer of the Word” is to always write out an action step as a result of your reading or studying or reflecting on God’s Word.  Develop the habit of writing down exactly what you intend to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Bible was not given to increase our knowledge but to change our lives. D. L. Moody<br>
<br>
Father I thank you for your powerful, life-changing Word.  I want my mind to be saturated with Scripture.  Help me to build my life on your truth.<br>

<br>
TRANSFORMED BY TROUBLE<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.  Romans 8:28<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: There is a purpose behind every problem.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Question to Consider: What problem in my life has caused the greatest growth in me?<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
God has a purpose behind every problem.  You should expect four kinds of problems in life.<br>
<br>
·        Trials are designed by God to draw us closer to him and build our character.  Temptations are designed by the Devil to draw us away from God and destroy our character.<br>
<br>
·        Trespasses are hurts caused by the sins of others.<br>
<br>
·        Troubles are usually, but not always, the consequences of our own sinful choices.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
When you face a problem, try to determine the source first.  If the trouble is your own fault, you should repent of it.  If it is a temptation from Satan, you should resist it.  If it is a trespass against you by others you need to release it through forgiveness.  But if the problem is a trial from God, you need to relax and trust God in it.  Regardless of the source, none of your problems could happen without God’s permission.  Everything that happens in the life of a child of God is Father-filtered, and he intends to use it for good.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. II Corinthians 4:17<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Everything that God allows to happen in your life is permitted for one great, eternal purpose: to conform your character to the image of Christ.  It is for your growth and God’s glory, and it is a plan guaranteed to succeed.  It will be completed when you get to heaven.  The Bible says Jesus “learned obedience through suffering” (Hebrews 5:8 KJV).  We grow the same way, and Jesus is our model.  We go through exactly what Christ goes through.  If we go through the hard times with him, then we’re certainly going to go through the good times with him (Romans 8:17 MSG).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Dear God of all comfort, help me to remember that there is a loving purpose behind every problem that you allow in my life.  Teach me to respond to the difficulties the way Jesus would.  Cultivate my character through the circumstances of life.  Help me to trust your purpose in my pain.<br>

GROWING THROUGH TEMPTATION<br>
<br>
God blesses the people who patiently endure testing.  Afterward they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.  James 1:12 NLT<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: Every temptation is an opportunity to do good.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider: What Christ-like character quality could I develop by defeating the most common temptation I face?<br>
<br>
To have the fruit of the Spirit is to be like Christ.  How then does the Holy Spirit produce his fruit in your life?  Instantly?  No.  Fruit matures and ripens slowly.  God develops the fruit of the Spirit in your life by allowing you to experience circumstances where you’re tempted to express the exact opposite quality!  Character development always involves a choice, and temptation provides that opportunity.  Every time you defeat a temptation, you become more like Jesus!<br>
<br>
Overcoming temptation today.<br>
1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Refuse to be intimidated.  Temptation is a sign that Satan hates you, not a sign of weakness or worldliness.  It is also a normal part of being human and living in a fallen world.  Don’t be surprised or shocked or discouraged bye it.  Be realistic about the inevitability of temptation, you’ll never be able to avoid it completely.  The Bible says, When you’re tempted…not if.  It is not a sin to be tempted.  Jesus was tempted, yet he never sinned.  It is not sin unless you give in to temptation, and that is a choice.<br>
2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Recognize your pattern of temptation and be prepared for it.  There are certain situations that make you more vulnerable to temptation than others.  These situations are unique to your weaknesses and you need to identify them because Satan surely knows them!  He knows exactly what trips you up and he is constantly working to get you into those circumstances.  You should identify your typical pattern of temptation and then prepare to avoid those situations as much as possible.  The Bible tells us repeatedly to anticipate and be ready to face temptation.  Paul wrote, Don’t give the Devil a chance (Ephesians 4:27 TEV).  Wise planning reduces temptation.<br>
3.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Request God’s help.  The Bible guarantees that your cry for help will be heard because Jesus is sympathetic tour struggle.  He faced the same temptations we do.  God’s love is everlasting and his patience endures forever.  If you have to cry out for God’s help 200 times a day to defeat a particular temptation he’ll still be eager to give mercy and grace.<br>
<br>
When the Holy Spirit controls our lives, he will produce this kind of fruit in us: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.  Galatians 5:22-23 NLT<br>
<br>
Wonderful Father, thank you for the gift of choice.  Help me to remember that temptation is always an opportunity to do the right thing.  Today I choose your will for my life.<br>

DEFEATING TEMPTATION<br>
<br>
God is faithful.  He will keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you can’t stand up against it.  When you are tempted he will show you a way out so that you will not give in to it. I Corinthians 10:13 NLT<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  There’s always a way out.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Who could I ask to be a spiritual partner to help me defeat a persistent temptation by praying for me?<br>
<br>
4. Refocus your attention on something else.  Ignoring a temptation is far more effective than fighting it.  Once our mind is on something else, the temptation loses its power.  So when temptation calls you on the phone, don’t argue with it, just drop the receiver.  To reduce temptation, keep your mind occupied with God’s Word and other good thoughts.  You defeat bad thoughts by thinking of something better.  This is the principle of replacement.  You overcome evil with good.<br>
<br>
5. Reveal your struggle to a godly friend or support group.  If you’re losing the battle against a persistent bad habit, an addiction, or a temptation and you’re stuck in a repeating cycle of good intention-failure-guilt, you will not get better on your own!  You need the help of others.  Some temptations are only overcome with the help of a partner who prays for you, encourages you, and holds you accountable.  God’s plan for your growth and freedom includes other Christians.  Authentic, honest fellowship is the antidote to your lonely struggle against those sins that won’t budge.  God says it is the only way you’re going to break free.<br>
<br>
6. Resist the Devil.  Paul tells us to, “Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God” (Ephesians 6:17 NLT).  First you must accept God’s salvation.  You won’t be able to say no to the Devil unless you’ve said yes to Christ.  Without Christ, we’re defenseless against the Devil, but with the helmet of salvation our minds are protected by God.  Second, you must use the Word of God as your weapon against Satan.  Jesus modeled this when he was tempted in the wilderness.  Every time Satan suggested a temptation, Jesus countered by quoting Scripture.  There is power in God’s Word.<br>
<br>
7.  Realize your vulnerability.  God warns us to never get cocky and overconfident; that is the recipe for disaster.  We must never let down our guard and think we’re beyond temptation.  Don’t carelessly place yourself in tempting situations.  Avoid them.  Remember that it is easier to stay out of temptation than to get out of it.  Every time you stand up to a temptation you become more like Jesus.<br>
<br>
When people are tempted and still continue strong, they should be happy.  After they have proved their faith God will reward them with life forever.  James 1:12 NCV<br>
<br>
Father I need your grace in defeating the persistent temptations in my life.  Give me the courage to share my struggle with a friend who can hold me accountable and give me support.<br>

IT TAKES TIME<br>
<br>
God began doing a good work in you, and I am sure he will continue it until it is finished when Jesus Christ comes again.  Philippians 1:6 NCV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: There are no shortcuts to maturity.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  In what area of my spiritual growth do I need to be patient and persistent?<br>
<br>
Spiritual growth, like physical growth, takes time.  While we worry about how fast we grow, God is concerned about how strong we grow.  God views our lives from and for eternity so he is never in a hurry.  Discipleship is the process of conforming to Christ.  Christ-likeness is the destination where you’ll eventually arrive, but your journey will last a lifetime.  So far we’ve seen that this journey involves believing (through worship), belonging (through fellowship), and includes becoming (through discipleship).  Every day God wants you to become a little more like him.<br>
<br>
Why does spiritual growth take so long?  We are slow learners.  We quickly forget God’s lessons and revert to our old behavior.  We have a lot to unlearn.  The Bible calls this “taking off the old self” and “putting on the new self.”  We are afraid to humbly face the truth about ourselves.  Only as God is allowed to shine the light of his truth on our faults can we begin to work on them.  Growth is often painful and scary.  Every change involves a loss of some kind.  Habits take time to develop.  Your habits define your character.<br>
<br>
Everything on earth has its own time and its own season.  Ecclesiastes 3:1 CEV<br>
<br>
There’s only one way to develop the habits of Christ-like character: practice them over time!  There are no instant habits.  If you practice something over time, you get good at it.  Repetition is the mother of character and skill.  These character building habits are often called spiritual disciplines.<br>
<br>
Practice these things.  Devote your life to them so that everyone can see your progress.  I Timothy 4:15 GW<br>
<br>
If it seems slow, do not despair, for these things will surely come to pass.  Just be patient!  They will not be overdue a single day!  Habakkuk 2:3 LB<br>
<br>
How to handle the wait:  Expect gradual improvement.  Believe God is working in your life even when you don’t feel it.  Keep a journal of lessons learned.  Write down God’s lessons so you can review and remember them.  Be patient with God and with yourself.  God’s timetable is rarely the same as ours.  Don’t get discouraged.  Remember how far you’ve come, not just how far you have to go.<br>
<br>
Lord, when I get discouraged help me to see how far I’ve come, not just how far I still have to go.  Thank you that you will never give up on me and will complete what you’ve started.<br>
