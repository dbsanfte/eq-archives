She looked at him carefully, even as he held Swven and did or said nothing to alert her presence to the others.  &quot;You...you can hear me.&quot;  It wasn't a question, it was a statement, and it came reluctant to her tongue.

<br>
she had shoved it into the back of her mind, tried to forget about it, but now it was back again, back and she couldn't put it away. it grated on her like he was more than he said. she sighed.<br>
<br>
*I can't figure it out, not now.* she took her leave and went to make aquaintances with the new twins.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, I'm Mahrain Nuit. Your aunt is a magnificent woman,&quot; SHe said, smiling and offering her hand. &quot;She tells me you both do voodoo,&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We do, the vodun way is ours chere, and we use it. It be what brought us to dis grotto here.&quot; Chandi said.<br>
<br>
a strange feeling passed over marsi, as though something had been looking at her, or talking to her, but she couldn't see it, or couldn't hear it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chandi, chere, you feel that? that touch?&quot; She asked, looking around.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was a spirit Dahlin'. nothin' more. It probably be a spirit of the rock here, just a lwas. you ain't never get worked up over 'em chil' so simmer down your self,&quot; Chandi admonished, looking around also.<br>

It was no longer a request, it was a demand count now smeered in blood from Swven. <br>
<br>
&quot;Soon enough.&quot; Count responded, seeing the future was sometimes painful, and in any case. Swves future was something he didnt want to see. But had, He took his long bony fingers and moved the hair out of swves eyes and tucked it behind his hair. &quot;Things I have seen tell me otherwise.&quot; He whispered, hopping no one could hear. Half way threw his tongue changed back to English. Instead of chinese.... In any case. Swven muttered something in Italian <br>
went and leaned by the wall and sat on the floor. * Yes, You've spoken so much I can see you clearly* Count said to the spirit in the room looking to the girls general direction. <br>
<br>
*you shouldn't think so much.* he smiled once more, sitting on the counter. Mamah G Wasn't present, she couldn't tell him no. Blood was smeered on his shirt and arms, and he left it there. it would go away. All about good timing.<br>

&quot;Shh....I'm trying to find out where it's going to jump to next.&quot; Caleb nodded, and put his head against the cool stone of the cave, which eased his headache a bit. Then Shalel jumped up. <br>
&quot;Found it?&quot; He asked looking over. She nodded, and pulled him up, and they were on the move again.<br>

His smile fadded.. Count winced in pain suddenly, he was a terrible actor but none the less he tried to hide it. &quot;Count?&quot; Swven asked looking at him. Count smiled a painful smile at swven. &quot;It's nothing.&quot; he said his breath a whisper, like it were squeezed out of his throat.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Daniel wondered around the mansion, stumbling upon Shalel and Caleb, His orange eyes blinked in curiosity, &quot;Hey.&quot; he said. His French accent flowing threw the air. Reaching there ears peacefully, his vampire eyes saw clearly in the dark. &quot;What are you guys up to?&quot; he walked over as if he were in some waltz like dance. Hands in the pocket of his trench coat. hair floating lightly on the wind of his step. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/3/03 8:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=187>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Uncomfortable Presence Behind Thy Shoulder</span><hr size=1> Athena lowered her eyes to the floor, her raven black hair swaying in a nonexistent wind.  &quot;I was not always like this,&quot; she said softly.  &quot;Neither was my moth...neither was Maetem.&quot;  A brief flash of pain filled her expression.  &quot;Something happened to her...and so I share the same fate.  I do her bidding, because she does love me, though not as she once did.  She has helped me grow strong and she protects me.  I owe her my life.&quot;  <br>

She looked at Swven and the others around them, eyelashes narrowing.  &quot;When the one who gave you life beseeches you, no matter who she is inside, what else can you do?  It is not like I have much of a choice.&quot;  She avoided specifying what she meant by &quot;who she is inside&quot;, and just stared upon all the others in the kitchen, taking in the homeliness of it, the sense of family.

Count gripped the edges of the counter obviously. His skin flushed white on his knuckles as he stopped himself from hunching over. <br>
<br>
&quot;Count.&quot; Swven said. Glaring at him as he had been hiding a painful secret from the rest of the group. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Count said. Smiled at him, and let the smile waiver over to swven. But it didnt. Nothing much seemed to be happening here. When in deed, something bad was happening other places. Count decided to stay in the caves. And abandoned his home where he had stayed for centuries.  <br>
