<br>
The following is a rough checklist that I try and go through for a workshop or class.<br>
<br>
Preparation<br>
<br>
1.  About two weeks before the workshop or class I want to be sure that I have a formal--written outline.<br>
2.  Have I reviewed the appropriate writtings of well known authorities on the subject matter?<br>
3.  Is there a visual aide(s) that will help in the presentation?<br>
4.  Do I have all the equipment that might help or that is necessary (fly-o, television, VCR, etc.)?<br>
5.  If a student does not understand a concept or disagrees with a principle do I have an alternate way of explaining the concept or a better way of presenting the principle?<br>
6.  Am I prepared to  recommend in particular writings or tapes if asked?<br>
7.  Have I thoroughly gone over (rehearsed) what I am going to say/do--is it clear, concise--CAN IT BE IMPROVED.<br>
<br>
Immediately (the day or morning before) before the workshop/class<br>
<br>
1.  If inside, is there enought seating, if using a video is it working, is all the equipment at hand.<br>
2.  If there are hand outs, do I have enought?<br>
3.  If outside--if we are going to cast what is the best lay out--what is wind direction, what about the lighting, is there a good background to see the casting loops   <br>
4.  HAVE I REVIEWED MEL KRIEGER'S OBSERVATIONS ON TEACHING FLYCASTING.  A very few of his keen and wise observations in this booklet are:<br>
<br>
      GREAT TEACHERS:<br>
         Suppress their own ego.<br>
         Want the student to perform better than the    instructor.<br>
          Are patient ....<br>
         Convince students that they alone have made the discoveries....<br>
          Balance critique with sufficient and justified praise.  Avoid negative words like, terrible, poor. don't....<br>
          <br>
        (This is one of my favorites of Mel's points)<br>
          Listen carefully.<br>
          In order to notice unrealistic and often self critical persepectives.<br>
          In order to question intelligently--leading the student to analyze and solve problems.<br>
          In order to honor the student as an individual  <br>
<br>
The actual workshop or class:<br>
<br>
      1.  Introduction of instructor(s)<br>
       2.  Brief outline of what will be covered<br>
       3.   Ask each student to introduce himself or herself and to give pertinent information about themselves such as, how long has he/she been flyfishing, what type of fish does he/she like to pursue, how often does he/she get to fish, and most important, if there is one aspect of casting or one casting problem that he/she would like to have covered today what would that be?  When the student is asked to introduce themselves they immediately become participants in the class, communications begin to be established and valuable information that can guide the instructor can be gained.<br>
<br>
       4.  If there is going to be casting involved emphasize the importance of safety--everyone should be wearing glasses, hats and there should be sufficient distance between the students--WE DON'T WANT ANYONE GETTING STRUCK IN THE EYE WITH A ROD TIP OR LEADER.<br>
       5.  Follow the outline you have planned but remain flexible--this is for the students.<br>
<br>
       6.  Be prepared to loan a student the proper equipment if he/she does not have the proper or adequate equipment<br>
<br>
        7.  Try to be sure that each student has had that casting problem or aspect of casting covered<br>
<br>
        8.  Allow each student self discovery time.<br>
<br>
         9.  Team the students so they can help each other if appropriate.  (Caution do not team husbands with wives or fathers with sons)<br>
<br>
         10.  Conclude the workshop be sure that each student knows that you enjoyed their participation and that if they would like to spend some additional time that you will be more than happy to do so or that if they would like to call you or e-mail you be sure that they have your phone number and e-mail.<br>
<br>
Jeff, I hope this helps and covers the points you asked about.  As you know, what is being covered and who the students are can greatly influence how you approach the preparation.  I have not included an actual outline for a class or workhshop, however, if you would like to have an ouline for an actual workshop let me know and I will e-mail you a copy of one.<br>

<br>
The following is an outline that I have used for a workshop called Practicing With A Purpose.  This particular workshop is geared toward beginners.  This workshop is for about three plus hours and starts with a lecture and then proceeds to the below listed drills with the students doing the drills after they have been demonstrated.  I normally have a handouts, Bill Gammel's 5 Essentials published by FFF and a sheet that setsforth the 9 drills as listed, so the students can hopefully utilize the drills in their practice sessions at home.<br>
<br>
            PRACTICING WITH A PURPOSE<br>
<br>
INTRODUCTION OF INSTRUCTOR(S)<br>
<br>
WORKSHOP OVERVIEW--YOU CAN BECOME A BETTER CASTER BY ATTENDING WORKSHOPS, TAKING LESSONS, WATCHING VIDEOS AND READING BOOKS ON CASTING.  HOWEVER PRACTICING IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU CAN DO TO BECOME A BETTER CASTER, AND MORE PARTICULARLY PRACTICING PROPERLY.  THIS WORKSHOP CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS. FIRST, A DISCUSSION ABOUT CASTING PRINCIPLES-WHAT WE CALL THE ESSENTIALS OF CASTING.  THE SECOND PART OF THIS WORKSHOP WILL BE HANDS ON CASTING, WE WILL BE GOING OVER DRILLS AND EXERCISES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL HELP YOU IN DEVELOPING A SOLID MANNER ON HOW TO PRACTICE.<br>
<br>
INTRODUCTION OF STUDENTS--WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT EACH OF YOU--<br>
   YOUR NAME<br>
    HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN FLYFISHING<br>
    HOW OFTEN YOU FLYFISH IN A YEAR<br>
    WHAT KIND OF FISH YOU LIKE TO FISH FOR<br>
    AND MOST IMPORTANT--IF THERE IS ONE ASPECT  OF CASTING OR ONE CASTING PROBLEM THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE COVERED IN THIS WORKSHOP WHAT WOULD THAT BE.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE PRINCIPLES OF CASTING<br>
    1.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STYLE AND SUBSTANCE<br>
 <br>
     2.  SUBSTANCE OF CASTING<br>
          LOOPS--LOOPS--LOOPS/ GOOD LOOPS, POOR LOOPS AND NON LOOPS--WHAT WE WANT TO SEE, WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE<br>
<br>
          GOOD CASTING MEANS CONTROLLED CASTING--<br>
<br>
          THE FIVE ESSENTIALS OF CASTING<br>
<br>
         A.  THE ROD TIP MUST TRAVEL IN A STRAIGHT LINE PATH THROUGH THE CASTING STROKE--BOTH HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY<br>
<br>
          B.   EACH CASTING STROKE MUST BE CONCLUDED BY A DEFINED (POSITIVE) STOPPING OF THE ROD FOLLOWED BY AN APPROPRIATE PAUSE<br>
<br>
          C.  SLACK MUST BE KEPT TO AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM<br>
<br>
           D.  THE CASTING STROKE MUST BE OF APPROPRIATE LENGTH AND THE CASTING ARC MUST BE OF APPROPRIATE WIDTH<br>
<br>
            E.  POWER MUST BE APPLIED CORRECTLY<br>
<br>
HANDS ON CASTING<br>
<br>
EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR SAFETY--ALL SHOULD BE WEARING HATS, GLASSES AND APPROPRIATE DISTANCE SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BETWEEN STUDENTS<br>
<br>
WE SUGGEST THAT YOU MARK YOUR LINE--WE ARE LOOKING FOR CONTROL AND CONTROL REQUIRES CONSISTENCY.<br>
<br>
DEVELOPING A BASE LINE CAST--THE AMOUNT OF LINE THAT YOU CAN CONTROL--THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO ESTABLISH AND WORK ON<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is a practice plan for casting, your practice should be at regular intervals and for relatively short periods of time.  It is much better to practice three or four days a week for 15-20 minutes rather than one marathon session once a week.<br>
<br>
1. The pick-up and laydown cast.  You should begin practicing this cast with approximately 25 to 30 feet beyond the tip top, (your last guide) of your rod.  You should use your rod hand only.  You should make 10 good pick-up and lay down casts.  It is a good idea to watch every other backcast to insure that you are forming a good loop on your backcast.  A good pick-up and laydown cast means a cast that forms a good loop on both the backcast and the forward cast and that lays out straight on the presentation.<br>
<br>
2. The horizontal pick-up and laydown cast.  Again you should practice this cast with 25 to 30 feet beyond the tip top of your rod.  You should again use only your rod hand.  You should make 10 good horizontal casts.  The purpose of this exercise is to better enable you to watch your loop formation and be sure that you are forming good loops on both the forward and backcasts.  You should watch both the backcast and the forward cast.<br>
<br>
3. Now you should do 10 pick-up and laydown casts using both your rod and line hand—be sure that your hands move in unison and that the distance between your hands remains constant.  If you allow your hands to drift apart and come close together slack will be introduced.  Again you should be sure that you are forming good loops on both the forward and backcasts.<br>
<br>
4. Now you should do 10 more pick-up and laydown casts with the presentation on the backcast.  The sequence is, using both hands, make a backcast, forward cast and then a backcast presentation (allow the line and fly to land on the backcast).  The purpose of this is to be sure that you are forming good loops on the backcast-the line should lay out straigt behind you if you are making good loops.<br>
<br>
5. Next, practice false casting, using both hands. Make ten casts.  The sequence preceding one presentation cast should be as follows, begin with a (1) backcast and forward cast (2) backcast and forward cast (3) backcast and forward cast (4) backcast and forward cast (5) backcast and presentation on the forward cast. How did your loops look?  We are looking for nice even loops with the bottom and top leg parrallel to each other with no shock waves. <br>
<br>
6. Next, make ten casts with the presentation on the backcast.  You should add one more backcast to the sequence for each cast as outlined above and make your presentation on the backcast.  Again this is to insure that you are forming good loops on your backcast and your line should lay out straight on the presentation.  Again look at your loops—how do they look?<br>
<br>
7. Practice shooting line.  Follow the instructions on number five and shoot line on the presentation.<br>
<br>
8. Practice accuracy<br>
<br>
9. Conclude by making 10 pick-up and laydown casts again using one hand.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When you can do all of the above forming good even—parrallel bottom and top legs you should increase the amount of line outside the tip-top by about one foot and work with that amount of line. (You are now trying to increase your baseline cast)  As you become able to handle more line you should increase the amount outside the tip-top in increments of about one foot.  When you are able to do the above with approximately 35 feet of line outside the tip top call me and we will move on to advanced techniques, such as hauling line.<br>

By the way I haven't talked to Pat again but I sent in my form for Bill Gammels class. I'll probably send him the stuff for the videos on Friday. Let me know if you want any additional copies. I'm taking Gary Borger's fly tying class too. The conclave will be fun this year. Do you have several applicants for the casting certification?<br>

 That is with out a doubt one of the best outlines I have ever read.<br>
  I will be using some of it for my Class &quot;Getting Ready for the Certification Test&quot; I will make some copies and hand them out. Your training schedule is better that any I have ever tried. AND I have tried out many. Bill will push the one foot add. This is an established way. Yours working in different directions and looking at ever other back cast is a good idea.<br>
 While we are here and working on some 'training the Instructor' lets cover a little more on what makes a good instructor.<br>
 I did a lot of reserch when I started to get ready be an instructor for real. (Not just a here let me help you)<br>
 Mel's list is well set and very easy to follow. <br>
 One of the major points that I like to make is &quot;The best instructor is a great student&quot; NEVER stop learning.<br>
<br>
  Here are some quotes from the great instructors.<br>
 Highet (1950) &quot;Knowledge of the subject;personel love of the material; and a high regard for the learners&quot; were his three essentials.<br>
 Ericksen (1985) &quot;Good teachers select and organize worthwhile course material, lead students to encode and intrgrate this material in memorable form..<br>
 Kidd (1973) Instructor's personality such as enthusiasm, humor, and clarity of expression, attitudes toward learners and their subject matter and there expertise are what makes effective instructors.<br>
<br>
 What I boil all this and much more down to is;<br>
 Get ready ahead of time.<br>
 Know your subject well,<br>
 Get to know your student, listen to them.<br>
 Cover &quot;Your&quot; subject well. Rights and wrongs<br>
 Smile and be happy.<br>
 Leave them wanting to learn more.<br>
 Be ready to learn from each student. They all have something to offer. If only to make you try harder.<br>
 Keep it fun.<br>
