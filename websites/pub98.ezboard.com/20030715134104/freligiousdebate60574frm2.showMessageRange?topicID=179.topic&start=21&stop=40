&quot; I suppose we should have let Hitler just continue to murder Jews by the millions too.&quot;<br>
<br>
We did. Crack a history book for Maude's sake, this is just getting fucking pathetic. Democracy from europe? America founded by god? Constitution written/inspired by god...hello, does the word Deist mean anything to you? Oh and my favorite--you telling CAD that, <br>
&quot;hello!!! I watched the electoral college and they DID put Bush in the whitehouse. (271-266) And independent recounts of the Florida votes after the fact put Bush over Gore in the disputed areas.&quot;<br>
The electoral college is NOT the same as winning the popular vote. The membership is decided by voting, but a person can (and has more than once in this country) won the popular vote, then lost the electoral college vote. Florida was NOT about seeing who won the popular vote, rather who would win that state, and thus get the electoral votes.<br>
Oh and one more thing---<br>
&quot;The popular vote is not how our country is set up. It would only benefit the most populous states on the coasts and discount all of middle America.&quot;<br>
<br>
WRONG...shame on your history teacher..graduate in SLC did we? The popular vote is indeed not how our country is set up (hence why we are a representative republic and not a pure democracy) but not because of the population of states--that's the advantage the electoral college gives now!!!!! A strictly popular vote would eliminate the power of the more populous states as entities with more ELECTORAL VOTES and mean candidates might actually come to places like Alabama or Montana as often as CA, FLA, NY and TX. If your Heavenly Father founded this country, why are his followers so shamefully ignorant of it's history...dang this is worse than conversing with DAG...grrrrr I hate people who twist history. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Although I just want to add that it also serves to perpetuate the two party system, which I think is a major cause of polarization in this country.  It will be interesting to see how the 2000 election affects voter turnout in 2004, even before the 2000 election voter turnout in the US was one of the lowest in the Western world.<br>

<br>
On my statement to CAD,my bad the way I read his statement, it looked like he said that the electoral college did NOT put Bush in office. <br>
<br>
Secondly, I disagree with your argument that the popular vote would benefit every state.  The high density states like NY and California have greater population  in a few cities  than say all of Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado and New Mexico.  The rural states and the less densly populated states would never see a presidential candidate because the candidates would woo the more metropolitan areas, forgetting the needs and wants of middle and rural America.  <br>
<br>
I would love to see the electoral college tweaked a little but not thrown out.<br>
<br>
My comments about Hitler were not specifically re: the US entering the war as much as they were to Trish who doesnt think Christians should be killing Christians ever. (or that war is ever justified) I wanted to know if she thought everyone, not just the US should have just stood by and let it happen because  in the German Army there might have been some Christians killed.<br>
 <br>
And lastly to Trish, My church was founded in 1830, yours not until late 1800's, we were sending missionaries all over the country and Europe 50 years before your church was founded.<br>

I find it odd that your church has been doing missionary work 50 years longer than mine, but we have reached 70 more lands than you (we also have some members in countries that aren't counted [the country] on the annual report).  I did notice that you have more members than we do.  <br>
<br>
Does your church count a person a member only after baptism or at some earlier point?  Also, how long does a person study with the missionaries before being allowed to be baptized?<br>

<br>
It's not so much your lack of knowledge that disturbs me, it's the shameless way you take positions out of this ignorance and twist history with NO supporting data. <br>
Oh--and yes, I also indicated you are a hypocrite based on the fact you constantly complain about how other xians get their LDS info from non-LDS sources...then turn around and blather on using false claims about Satanists having NEVER read Levy's work, bothered to visit the website or prayed with a Satanist. <br>
<br>
&quot;Secondly, I disagree with your argument that the popular vote would benefit every state.&quot;<br>
<br>
What I said was that the Electoral College gives more votes to those states with greater populations. A strictly democratic election would mean that ever single person's vote counted equally, even if he were a liberal in Utah or a conservative in CA...get it? This is how a candidate can win the popular vote and lose in the Electoral College and why they visit the states with the most electoral votes. In fact, some states are written off or ignored altogether since individual votes are not what matters in the end. What happens on the state level is what effects the national election...I really don't know how to take this down any further so maybe if you look this up on the internet or check out a high school book on the subject...<br>
<br>
&quot;I would love to see the electoral college tweaked a little but not thrown out.&quot;<br>
I don't disagree. My problem was with you making statements about American history and it's founding with so little real knowledge of American history and it's founding.<br>
<br>
Geez, I'm really sounding like DBC talking to DAG here, but I am happy to debate and disagree with many people I consider intelligent, but we can't have a discussion this way. Please either do some research (not highly technical, just High School level history) and then come back with some statements you can support.<br>

<br>
The only error I made there was that the Satanic bible was written by atheists.  And I didnt actually claim they did because I had NOT looked it up (see above), I just said IF it was written by athesists which is what I had gathered from posts early on in the history of this board.  The rest of the statements above I stand by completely.  And since you dont accept the BOM or other spiritual proof as real, I can do nothing to PROVE the statements above to you.  Who cares if Columbus didnt actually land on American soil. it was his journey that opened up the new world. I have yet to be convinced that the founding fathers did not believe in God.  For every quote that says they dont, you find others that say they did. But either way, they didnt have to be aware of his influence to have received it.  Thoughts and ideas may have been given to them, their intellect and ability may have been sharpened.  Im sure God didnt come down in person and say hey this is what I have in mind.  But guiding and directing their actions from behind the scenes, definitely within all the scopes of possibility.   Dont you ever  just have an idea come to you?<br>
<br>
(I also wanted to touch on something from an earlier post that I didnt address, On the OT stuff, I CAN say that the OT is not in effect and still not agree with Homosexuality, remember we have a current prophet that talks for God and He has made it clear that the only sexual Union God accepts in a man and a woman who are legally married.<br>
<br>
Those who put a woman down with the bible, do not understand the role of women in the gospel as it was originally taught by the Savior - (that tagline, the good book is missing a few pages - it is definitely missing a few verses here and there and some have been altered by men) )<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and practically every word you post re: history and other belief systems indicate ignorance and stuipidity.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I beg to differ.  The only belief system that I have NOT been willing to look at in my life is the satanist thing you keep throwing out.  As far as history, I have been accurate in the context of the conversation, do I know that America was practicing isolationism and choose to ignore the situation in Europe, until the Japanese involuntarily  brought us into the war, yes! but that didnt have anything to do with the question I posed to Trisha.    When speaking on my belief that God had a hand in the establishment of this country, does that mean I dont know that the native americans, African americans and women in general did not have access to these same rights until much later down the road, NO it means that the constitution itself was inspired by GOD all that other stuff has nothing to do with the writing of the constitution.  If the constitution was not inspired as it was, we may still be a slave holding, women bashing, native american killing nation.

I know that we only go where the governments of those countries grant permission to be there and proselytize:  Here are the lastest stats from April conference:<br>
 <br>
Missions  335 <br>
Stakes  2,602 <br>
Districts  641 <br>
Wards and Branches  26,143<br>
 <br>
Church Membership  <br>
Total Membership  11,721,548 <br>
 <br>
Increase in Children of Record  81,132 <br>
 <br>
Converts Baptized  283,138 <br>
Missionaries  <br>
Number of Full-Time Missionaries  61,638 <br>
<br>
A person is only counted once they are baptized.   As far as length of time a person studies before baptism, it is individual.  When they feel that they have a testimony of the restoration (Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith, living prophet etc.) and make a choice to live the Word of Wisdom and the law of chasity ( no sex outside of marriage) then they can be baptized.   Children of record are kids who live in an LDS family who are under the age of 8.  They aren't counted as members until they choose to be baptized. so that 81, 132 are new births in LDS families in the last year.<br>
<br>
Once I got thinking, I remembered that our news followed those court proceedings pretty closely as the outcomes would impact our efforts as well.  I am glad that they found in favor of the right to proselytize.  I am sorry that I got a little &quot;passionate&quot; about the war stuff.  I am a firm believer that there are times that war is necessary.  I respect your right to disagree. -- Shirene <br>

No, you were also wrong about the Electoral College...twice, then about god inspiring Columbus (nice try to cover this, but really no good), the popular vote count in FLA and whether it had to do with the Electoral College, Hitler and...oh you get the picture. It's the pattern of false claims.<br>
<br>
&quot;And since you dont accept the BOM or other spiritual proof as real, I can do nothing to PROVE the statements above to you.&quot;<br>
Neither does any non-Mormon here and it is not a valid source of proof in a debate anymore than the Book of the Dead or the Koran. You said god founded America and you &quot;won't apologize for it&quot;, not even one other xian sect agrees with this, so either put up or shut up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who cares if Columbus didnt actually land on American soil.&quot;<br>
<br>
those of us concered with historical accuracy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dont you ever just have an idea come to you?&quot;<br>
You mean like the color of DBC's eyes? Oh wait...guess the spirit misguided someone on that. Ideas that &quot;occur&quot; to me are the result of physical processes in my brain. I can provide proof of this, so you see that's a convincing argument.<br>
<br>
&quot;Homosexuality, remember we have a current prophet that talks for God and He has made it clear that the only sexual Union God accepts in a man and a woman who are legally married.&quot;<br>
Your god still a homophobe too? Big surprise. So I was right about this then? Not sure what your point is.<br>
<br>
&quot;I beg to differ. The only belief system that I have NOT been willing to look at in my life is the satanist thing you keep throwing out.&quot;<br>
Really? Please explain to me your take on Jaanism and Sikhs. How about Buddhism, how many Buddhist prayers or chants have you said? Know how it relates to Hinduism? Maybe, but you also mentioned JW's think only 144,000 people go to heaven-not true. and the birthday thing isn't because of what bad anyone did in the past, it has to do with putting one person above others...if you've studied these things, perhaps it is you who need a JW &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;sister&quot; to visit you and set you straight on what it really is. You also practice many pagan rituals as expressly forbidden in the bible...a JW could help you see this.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am neither stupid nor malinformed.&quot;<br>
Gosh, I hope you have more evidence of this than of your god.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you just have a bad taste in your mouth for Mormons&quot;<br>
Actually I have no more a bad taste for LDS than any of the rest of the xians (okay, evangelicals rub me the wrong way more often), but I will say you seem less informed about some of the assertions you make than most I know. Perhaps it is the situation and crowd or education level, but it is not because I am singling you out, so you can step off the cross now.<br>
<br>
Oh--and I don't suffer the superiority complex religion bestows on it's &quot;saved&quot; and &quot;chosen&quot; people, but I will say I feel more educated, rational and lucky to be free of the intolerance and hatred of which your prophet speaks. I guess, to steal from another thread I'm proud of it, but not enough to track you down to your home and tell you how much so I am, how wrong you are and how I am divinely inspired and chosen.<br>

First, from Gone with the Wind &quot; Frankly my dear I dont give a damn.&quot;  since when did the LDS church depend on the opinion of other christian churches in forming its doctrine? - <br>
<br>
 Second I'll email you a personal memo from God on the subject. - along with a photo of God standing over Thomas Jefferson whispering in his ear.<br>
<br>
Ya know what, it is I who am bored with you and your circular logic.  &quot;you cant show me God, so he doesnt exist, so because he doesnt exist any spiritual confirmation or writings of spiritual leaders is just made up so and because its all just made up, anything spoken by someone who believes in God or spiritual matters is hogwash.&quot;  blah blah blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
Third, there is not one shred of proof here that you have shared that puts me wrong on my history.  Umm Hitler did kill millions of jews, my point was should we have let it continue.  Columbus did come to the new world which was the impetus for the beginning of America,  following any of this yet?<br>
<br>
On the birthday thing - that was straight from the mouth of my JW friend in High school.  The 144,000 thing -- it is you who is wrong, ask Trish. Only that many will live with God the rest of us that are resurrected live on the earth in its paradisacal form.<br>
<br>
Jaanism, never heard of it, Sikh - I know they have a temple being built near by.  Find the quote on my part that said I know everything there is to know about other religions. -- Didnt say it.  I said the only religion I was/am unwilling to delve into is Satanism.  And the little I read on the link you gave me, just proved to me that it is inspired by Satan - the EVIL spirit who was cast out of heaven because of rebellion.  It is all about Me  Me ME and me.  Basically its the first church of selfishness and self indulgence. Whereas Christ taught that the two greatest commandments are to love God and to Love others, pretty much the antithesis for me me me.  Indulge in all your passions and desires, dont deprive yourself of anything - opposite of self control and thinking of the welfare of others.  Is this something you honestly feel is a good thing?<br>
<br>
If a Sikh missionary came to my door, I would invite them in and ask them to share their doctrines with me.  I like to be educated about other religions, because it only confirms my faith in my own beliefs. <br>
<br>
<br>
Please show me one quote from my prophet that says we should hate homosexuals or anyone for that matter.  Do we believe that the only sexual relationship that God condones is between married man and women - absolutelyand do not apologize for it.  But my prophet has been more than clear that we are to love everyone.  A former prophet even went as far to say, dont judge another because they choose to sin differently than you do.  People who have homosexual feelings are more than welcome  as members of our church as long as they choose to keep the same commandments that we all are given.  anyway blah blah blah we've been down this road before as well.<br>
<br>
 I dare ya to find anything in President Hinkleys writings or addresses that encourages hate.  We also dont condone adultry or premarital sex, bank robbery, lying, drinking smoking or drinking coffee, .......... but that doesnt mean we HATE people who engage in those activities either.<br>
<br>
And just for the record - college graduate - Human Development and Spanish.  Sp please get over your need to correct my history that isnt incorrect.<br>
<br>
On that note, I didnt say that the popular vote in Florida was related to the popular vote at large. I was merely saying that those who are still up in the night thinking that Gore won the Florida vote and should have been elected by the electoral college were wrong because Bush DID win the vote in Florida so he was legitimately voted in by the elctoral college.  What exactly did you think I was saying?  About my personal musings on the benefits of the Electoral college, that is an opinion.  You can choose to have a different opinion, but you cant correct it and tell me I am inacurate.  We honestly dont know what would happen if the electoral college was disbanded so both opinions are just speculation at this point.<br>
<br>
By the way... Im done correcting your incorrect corrections of my accurate statements.  I have better things to do. - Shirene<br>

Look at the case of the SS St. Louis--a boatload of Jewish refugees who, having been denied landing at their final destination in Havana, Cuba, was subsequently also turned away by the US.  The boat was sent back to Europe, even though we knew what was going on over there.  The isolationist agenda that our nation was adhering to at the time prevented us from doing anything at all to help the Jews--that is, until we ourselves were attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor, and even then our war was declared on Japan, not Germany.  Aside from freezing the assets of the Axis powers, I don't think we really did squat until 1941--8 years after the first concentration camp was opened.  Just because we &quot;eventually&quot; came in to help overthrow Hitler, does no give us claim to any moral authority.<br>

4. Did ask whether we should have just let Hitler continue (meaning everybody not just US)  did not say that the US jumped right in and fought for the rights of the Jewish people.  Probably said (don t remember and dont have time at the moment to scroll back) that the US had a a huge impact on the sucess of WWII and WE DID.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>no birthday celebration because a few wicked people did some bad things on theirs or someone's birthday,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
When it comes to the birthday issue, both ST and Shirene are both right.  I do have a problem though with the way that Shirene stated it, that is why I quoted it.  I don't think that she really intended to sound this way, but it was &quot;typed&quot; with a matter of non-importance.  I feel that all experiences and information in the Bible is important.  Not to be taken lightly.  <br>
<br>
There are only two birthdays celebrated in the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bible</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (not a celebration of the birth of a child, that is different).  Both were celebrated by evil men of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bible</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, in fact at one of these birthdays John the Baptizer was beheaded to please a woman.  Can't get much worse than that.  There is no account that birthdays were celebrated by Jesus or any of his followers, or to go back further there were not any celebrated in the time of the Old Testament (except for the other account of the Pharaoh of Egypt, and someone was beheaded at that party also for entertainment).  So since Witnesses try to live their lives by Bible principles and examples we see that birthdays must not have been an approved celebration for followers of Jehovah.<br>
