Muslim rioters burn 13 churches in north Nigeria<br>
 <br>
LAGOS, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Islamic militants burned to the ground thirteen churches and several houses in a remote northern Nigerian town after a Christian student was accused of blasphemy, police said on Thursday.<br>
<br>
Irate youths torched churches, houses and shops late on Tuesday in Kazaure, some 80 km (50 miles) north of Kano, a northern provincial capital where hundreds have died in religious clashes in the past three years.<br>
<br>
The dispute began when a Christian student was accused of insulting the Prophet Mohammad and a group of Muslims were not satisfied with the response of school authorities.<br>
<br>
Abubakar Sale, police commissioner in the northern Jigawa state, told Reuters that the rioters attempted to invade the school but were repelled by police.<br>
<br>
&quot;The hoodlums then mobilised and went into town where they started looting and burning people's property,&quot; Sale said by phone from Dutse, the state capital.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thirteen churches were burnt, several houses and shops were torched, but there were no deaths,&quot; said Keirian Dudari, assistant inspector general of police in Kano.<br>
<br>
Police said the town was calm on Thursday after reinforcements were deployed to quell the riots. <br>
<br>
The violence came after three students were killed and more than 30 injured in fighting between Muslims and Christians at a university in northeastern city of Maiduguri earlier this month.<br>
<br>
More than 5,000 people have been killed in religious violence in northern Nigeria in the past four years since the introduction of Islamic sharia law in 12 states.  <br>

I bet not</span><hr size=1> I think it was Tuesday afternoon.  I had come home from my classes, and laid down and turned on the tv to see what was on (something I don't do very often, but I was tired).  I stopped at the cable news channels.  Three of them were all doing the same thing - they had cameras at some airport in California and were saying that they were waiting for Michael Jackson's plane to arrive.  I even saw type on the screen saying they expected his plane any minute.  (In truth, they didn't have a clue if he was even coming to that airport or if he was even on a plane at all.)<br>
<br>
So I left it there for a few minutes, listening to the actual story - about why they were waiting for Michael Jackson - listening to them tell about the lawsuit.  Then this private jet came in for a landing and they were all like, &quot;This might be his plane.&quot;  And they followed the fool plane all around the runway until it stopped.  FOX news was actually the first to say it wasn't Jackson's plane.  As they got a closer look at the plane as it was going along the runway, someone said the numbers on the plane didn't match Jackson's numbers.  But despite them saying this, FOX news kept following that little plane around and kept on talking.  All three stations showed the people aboard that plane (who knows who they were) getting off and walking away.<br>
<br>
Too bad I didn't tape it off and take it in to my broadcast journalism professor.  I'm about to graduate from college with a degree in journalism.  I have been trained to look at all forms of news critically (broadcast, print, radio).<br>
<br>
That was some of the worst journalism I have ever seen.  First of all, most Americans could care less about Michael Jackson.  Most of his fans are from other countries.  Here in the USA, people regard him more as a one man freak show and have little or no interest in him.  Second, there was no new news.  They were showing nothing but runways of some airport while repeating the same information over and over.  They were trying to hype up something they had no new information about.<br>
<br>
And as I sat there, I was thinking at the time, &quot;Surely there is real news going on in the world that we would like to know about.  Something more important that a one man freak show celebrity with an arrest warrant out for sexually molesting a kid.  Like we didn't see it coming.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh, and then the next day in the evening, I was flipping through channels and on one of those news channels, I saw some news anchor guy say something like, &quot;We believed he might have tried to flee the country.&quot;<br>
<br>
Riiiiiight... like where is Michael Jackson going to blend in unnoticed? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One important aspect that all journalists should take into account before reporting news is the newsworthiness of what they are going to report.<br>
<br>
IMHO, Michael Jackson having an arrest warrant out was of very little news value and was not worthy of the time it was given.  They should have stated that he had an arrest warrant out and whatever details, but they did not need to treat this like the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. <p>**********************************************<br>

If you had read what I wrote, I was against the media's news coverage of Michael Jackson and I stated that they should have been covering other events.<br>
<br>
What, do you want me to comment about the events you listed because I can do that if you like.  It looks to me like they came from a Christian news service because most of them look like they are about Christians.  And in all honesty, I seriously doubt you'd have seen all those covered even if they weren't covering Michael Jackson.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what kind of reaction you were wanting me to give, but clearly you didn't like what I said above and for that I do apologize.  I was looking at the incident from the perspective of a journalist.  As I said, that's what I've been trained to do.  And I'm sorry if I upset you by what I said. <p>**********************************************<br>

<br>
A question about the media, if I may...<br>
<br>
I'm a little hazy on my newsfeeds.<br>
<br>
I know the AP wire (Associated Press) pulls in stories from<br>
everywhere, thus, the sources of different stories are of<br>
varying quality, thus the reliability of different stories are of<br>
varying quality.<br>
<br>
Is Reuters the same way? <br>
I was of the impression that Reuters had correspondents, <br>
but didn't pull stories from different newspapers. Am I wrong<br>
in that impression?<br>
<br>
If not, that's a reliable story.<br>
<br>
If so, can you find a more neutral source for corroboration?<br>
<br>

People are sick of seeing the sickening truth of religious conflicts/wars, killings, etc. The news is depressing, and the media knows that covering a story like micheal jackson will get them ratings. <br>
<br>
But you have just practically judged the man guilty without actually even waiting for things like objective evidence, or even a trial. Im not saying he is innocent, but please, dubbing him as a &quot;one man freakshow&quot; is a little harsh. He has a larger fanbase in North America than you may think.  <p>Ego is a structure that is erected by a neurotic individual who is a member of a neurotic culture against the facts of the matter. And culture, which we put on like an overcoat, is the collectivized consensus about what sort of neurotic behaviors are acceptable.<br>
