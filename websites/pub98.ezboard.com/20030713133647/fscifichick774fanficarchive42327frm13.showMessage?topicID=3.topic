~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
SU2 Headquarters<br>
<br>
Kate walked into the building carrying two cups of coffee. Nick was already sitting at his desk and he smiled widely at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bringing me coffee?&quot; He asked as she handed him one of the cups. &quot;People are going to start thinking you like me,&quot; he teased and added a wink.<br>
<br>
&quot;Funny,&quot; she said sarcastically, but was also smiling as she sat down. Nick noticed that she seemed happier than usual.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that look,&quot; he said, causing her to arch an eyebrow at him. &quot;That's the 'I've met a guy' look.&quot; Her smile grew, but she said nothing. &quot;So are you going to tell me about him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nope,&quot; she answered. He pretended to be crestfallen at the comment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ouch, that really hurts Kate.&quot; He clutched his hand at his heart. She rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; She asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, primarily because I have no social life right now and I have to live vicariously through others,&quot; he said jokingly. She grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's always Carl,&quot; she retorted. His face contorted with disgust and Kate started laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Benson! O'Malley! My office now!&quot; Captain Page's bellowing could be heard throughout the unit. Kate and Nick started walking over to his office.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you're really not going to tell me?&quot; Nick asked, a slight tinge of hurt on his words. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not a chance. Any time I tell you about a guy I like it falls through, it's like you're a jinx,&quot; she explained. He cocked his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe they're just jealous,&quot; he suggested in a kidding manner. She smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't tell them about you,&quot; she responded. He stared at her for a second and smiled. They reached the office, only to find Jonathan already there with what looked like presentation material. Although presentations were usually held in the main lobby, special cases were brought to their attention in Page's office. 'It doesn't matter, I'm not going to let it ruin my day,' Kate thought. They sat down, still holding their 'to go' cups of coffee. Nick leaned over toward Kate while Jonathan was finishing putting his things together.<br>
<br>
&quot;Think if I forge a note from my mom that I can be excused?&quot; He quipped to her in a low volume. She grinned and took a sip of her coffee.<br>
<br>
&quot;Save your smart ass remarks for your own time O'Malley,&quot; Page said gruffly. &quot;We've got a serious situation here today.&quot; Nick smiled, completely unrepentant. &quot;Jonathan.&quot; The young man excitedly started the slide projector.<br>
<br>
&quot;La-dy,&quot; Jonathan strung out his first word, &quot;and gentlemen. May I present.&quot; The first slide came on the screen. &quot;The leprechaun.&quot; Kate arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've got to be kidding me,&quot; she commented as she looked at a cartoon drawing of a leprechaun.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me finish,&quot; Jonathan said, giving her as stern of a look as he could. Nick chuckled. &quot;As you can see, the common misconception about leprechauns is that they're tiny, or 'little people,'&quot; he used his fingers to make quotation marks during the last part of his sentence. He smiled and looked proud of himself for the research he had done. &quot;This, however, is untrue. They actually look just like humans.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So how are we supposed to find it?&quot; Kate asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what kind of ammo do we use?&quot; Nick chimed in. Jonathan's face dropped into an almost panicked expression.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; he shook his arms in front of him. &quot;You can't kill it. And I mean that literally. Even if it wasn't way more valuable to us alive, it can't be killed. Stunned or knocked out? Absolutely. But not killed.&quot; Nick smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll see,&quot; he said smugly. Kate hit him on the arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;So why is it dangerous?&quot; She asked. Jonathan pointed a finger at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent question!&quot; He smiled and Nick rolled his eyes. &quot;The leprechauns are tied into almost every facet of link activity.&quot; Kate grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, like Carl?&quot; She asked, although it came out as more of a statement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh, well, no. More in control than Carl,&quot; Jonathan answered. Nick's face beamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, they're the mob of the link world,&quot; he sniggered. Jonathan looked uneasy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Page confirmed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me get this straight,&quot; Kate started. &quot;You want us to find a leprechaun, that looks exactly like a human, because you suspect link mob activity?&quot; The disbelief was evident in her voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;If it helps, they usually wear green,&quot; Page said in a not quite consoling voice. She stared at him in astonishment.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's almost St. Patrick's Day! Most of the city is wearing green!&quot; She exclaimed as she rose from her seat. Nick got a smirky yet thoughtful look on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's got a point sir,&quot; he said. Page nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry, we've got some good leads,&quot; he paused and shrugged. He turned to Kate. &quot;And, if those don't pan out, I'm sure O'Malley will have fun using links as target practice until they tell us what we want to know.&quot; Nick's face lit up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot; He asked, his voice full of glee. Page rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're on the clock here people,&quot; he responded, ignoring Nick. &quot;St. Patrick's Day marks the high point of power for leprechauns, and now that they've established strong ties into the link community,&quot; he got a far away look in his eyes, &quot;There's no telling the havoc they could wreak if we don't stop them.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;So you're really not going to tell me?&quot; Nick asked. He glanced over at Kate, but quickly turned his attention back to the road. Carl peeked his head between the two from the back seat. He looked at Kate with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell him what?&quot; He asked. Kate shook her head and said nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;She has a new guy, but she won't tell me anything about him,&quot; Nick explained with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jealous?&quot; Carl sneered back at him. Nick rolled his eyes and punched his hand back at him. The car swerved and Kate grabbed the wheel. Nick just grinned and took over driving again.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're sure this is where we can find your contact?&quot; Kate asked Carl suspiciously. The old warehouse district was home to plenty of links, but they tended not to set up permanent residence there. Nick pulled the car over and parked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I'm sure,&quot; Carl said non-chalantly as he opened the back door. Nick and Kate both glared at him, indicating that he should stay in the car. &quot;No way, you guys are the outsiders here. I,&quot; he motioned to himself, &quot;on the other hand, am with my peeps.&quot; Nick and Kate looked at each other in a glib and defeated manner.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine,&quot; Nick agreed and slapped Carl on the back of the head. &quot;Don't break anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
The warehouse was old and should have been condemned was Kate's first thought; but then, that's probably why the links liked the area, not a lot of human competition except for storage people. They opened a door to a small room inside the warehouse, only to be met by glowing green eyes and a foul odor. Kate cringed and quickly covered her mouth and nose with her hand. Nick did the same.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, what? My aroma offending your delicate human senses?&quot; The link and Carl both laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Morty,&quot; Carl greeted his friend officially. &quot;I hear you got a piece of that job over on Michigan last week,&quot; he said, obviously impressed. Morty nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't get to join 'em in taking out the place, but I planned it out. Thirty percent,&quot; he replied, proud of himself. Kate cleared her throat and Nick shot Carl a look when he turned around to look at them. He rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine. If you don't want to give me time to catch up with an old friend,&quot; Carl said.<br>
<br>
&quot;We don't,&quot; Nick said immediately. Carl glared at him, but turned back to Morty.<br>
<br>
&quot;We need some help finding a leprechaun,&quot; he said in a grumbling manner. Morty started laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah right,&quot; he finally said. He glanced at the expressions on the detectives' faces. &quot;You're serious,&quot; he observed. &quot;Crap. If I tell you anything, I'll be dead before tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's a chance I'm willing to take,&quot; Kate said. Nick turned his head and smiled broadly at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's a chance I'm willing to inflict,&quot; Nick added in a happy voice, raising his gun to aim at the link. Morty's arms, all six of them, flailed wildly in the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; he said. &quot;But it didn't come from me.&quot; Nick and Kate nodded. Morty directed them to a restaurant/pub in the middle of the restaurant district called Eogan's. The place looked nice from the outside, but it was still early in the day, and the door was locked. Nick got out his gun, but Kate put her hand on his arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Warrant?&quot; She asked, trying to remind him that he was still a police officer. He smiled and looked around to make sure no one was watching, and then he shot the lock. He opened the door and he turned to Kate again.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's the nice thing about links, they don't have rights,&quot; he quipped. She shook her head, but followed him in. It was a nice establishment, probably pretty pricey if they were there to actually eat.<br>
<br>
&quot;And if they're not links?&quot; She asked as she looked around the place. Nick shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whoops?&quot; He offered with a smug smile. She shook her head and smiled. They began to look around, but no one was there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe we should come back later, put a car outside to let us know when someone actually shows up,&quot; Kate said. All of the paperwork in the offices seemed to be business related, and there were no signs, other than the fact that it was an Irish named establishment, to indicate that there was any kind of leprechaun-link activity. Nick nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
&quot;You ever get the feeling like you're on a wild goose chase?&quot; He asked as they made their way back to the main door. She sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;All the time.&quot;<br>
<br>
They walked out to the car and Kate thought she heard someone calling her name. Both turned to face the good-looking man coming toward them. Kate smiled and Nick frowned. The man quickly pulled Kate into a hug and gave her a small kiss. Nick raised an eyebrow, but quickly put on his best 'this doesn't bother me' face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do I get an introduction?&quot; He asked. Kate and the man turned to face him, both with smiles on their faces.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nick, this is Trevor, Trevor, Nick,&quot; she introduced the two men. They shook hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice to finally meet you,&quot; Trevor said. Nick smiled and made a mental note of the light Irish accent.<br>
<br>
&quot;You too.&quot; He looked at Kate. &quot;Kate's been talking about you a lot lately,&quot; he said, biting back a chuckle at his teasing her. She glared at him for a moment, but let it pass. Trevor looked at Kate lovingly, which made Nick feel queasy, but he covered it well.<br>
<br>
&quot;So what were you two doing at Eogan's? It's a little early for lunch,&quot; Trevor commented. Kate and Nick shared a look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just business,&quot; she answered. Trevor arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really? Will you be arresting my cousin then? Because that would be fantastic,&quot; he said with a smile. Kate looked surprised.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your cousin?&quot; She asked. He shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;He owns the place,&quot; he said as if it was nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot; Nick asked. If he wasn't suspicious of the guy before he met him, he certainly was now.<br>

<br>
&quot;He isn't,&quot; Kate argued. She was getting sick of this conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Isn't what?&quot; Captain Page asked as he strolled toward them. Apparently their voices had been a little louder than they thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nick thinks my boyfriend is a leprechaun,&quot; she said in an exasperated voice and rolled her eyes. Nick frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;When did he get upgraded to boyfriend status?&quot; He asked. She glared at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;When you argued with me the entire ride back to the station,&quot; she answered. Page looked back and forth between the two.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's enough,&quot; he said. Both officers grumbled. He looked at Nick. &quot;What makes you think he's a leprechaun?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;His cousin owns Eogan's, the restaurant where Carl's friend directed us,&quot; Nick said. Page nodded. &quot;And he has a little bit of an Irish accent.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sounds like a valid lead,&quot; he agreed. Nick smirked. &quot;So what's the problem? Why didn't you bring him in?&quot; Kate's mouth dropped open a little to protest.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's my boyfriend!&quot; She said emphatically. &quot;And he's not a leprechaun!&quot; She started to walk toward her desk. &quot;What's the matter with you people?&quot; She mumbled. Carl, who was sitting nearby, overheard her.<br>
<br>
&quot;You want a list?&quot; He laughed, but quickly shut up when she shot him a death glare. He raised his hands in mock surrender. &quot;Staying out of it.&quot; Captain Page came up to O'Malley.<br>
<br>
&quot;How serious is this 'relationship' she's involved in?&quot; He asked. Nick frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know, but I'll find out,&quot; Nick answered. He walked to his desk and smiled across at Kate. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; She looked up at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot; She asked. His smile grew wider.<br>
<br>
&quot;Absolutely. Just because his cousin is a leprechaun, it doesn't mean that he is,&quot; he smirked. She narrowed her eyes at him and then smiled and shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you considered the possibility that Morty was just lying to us?&quot; She asked. Nick nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course,&quot; he said. &quot;But that's because it's in my nature to be suspicious.&quot; Kate sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're just not going to let this go are you?&quot; She asked and he smiled again.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know me surprisingly well,&quot; he answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want me to do? I'm going out with him tonight.&quot; She sounded frustrated. He seemed to perk up, not at the fact that she was dating him, but at the plan forming in his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;You could wear a wire,&quot; he suggested. She glared at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're joking,&quot; she said as she looked at him. He said nothing. &quot;You're not joking. Do you know how uncomfortable those things are? Not to mention if he comes back to my place.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So don't invite him back to your place,&quot; Nick said, a little too cheerfully. Kate buried her head in her hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're impossible. You realize that?&quot; It came out as more of a statement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, but that's why you love me right?&quot; He smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not wearing a wire.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you gonna do? Just come right out and ask if he's a leprechaun?&quot; Nick laughed. Kate got a sardonic grin on her face and stood up.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's exactly what I'm going to do,&quot; she said. He looked at her, his smile started to fall when he realized she was serious. She started to leave the building.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh crap,&quot; he mumbled and got up to follow her.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey sweetheart,&quot; Trevor greeted her when he saw her come into the restaurant. He gave her a kiss and then looked briefly at Nick. &quot;Couldn't stay away from me huh?&quot; He teased. Kate smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, I had something to ask you,&quot; she said. Nick leaned over to speak in her ear.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't do this,&quot; he warned in a low voice, but still smiling as to not tip off Trevor. Kate kept the smile on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; Trevor asked. &quot;Oh, did you want some lunch? You can join me at my table.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright,&quot; Kate agreed. On the way to the table, Nick grabbed her arm loosely.<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean it, you're going to get us killed,&quot; he said, still trying to keep his voice upbeat. She tilted her head to speak to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh what? But it was perfectly okay just to have me be the one who got killed?&quot; She asked. Nick pretended to think about it and then grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well.&quot; he said. She hit him on the arm and he laughed. Trevor pulled a chair out for Kate and then sat next to her. Nick sat across from them. Trevor took hold of Kate's hand and flashed her a brilliant smile that made his eyes gleam.<br>
<br>
&quot;So what did you want to ask me love?&quot; He asked. She smirked at Nick and then turned her attention back to Trevor.<br>
<br>
&quot;My idiot partner,&quot; she motioned to Nick with her head, &quot;thinks that you're a leprechaun.&quot; Trevor eyed Nick suspiciously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Does he now?&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he confirmed. Trevor narrowed his eyes at him. Nick smirked. He turned to Kate. &quot;Notice that he hasn't denied it.&quot; She crossed her arms and gave him a 'you're unbelievable' look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why would I deny it?&quot; Trevor asked in an Irish lilt. Kate turned in his direction, completely surprised.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?!&quot; Kate asked loudly. Trevor shrugged and leaned back in his chair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why would I bother to confirm or deny such a ridiculous accusation?&quot; Trevor clarified. Kate let out a breath and grinned. She smugly glared at Nick, who in return smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you won't mind this,&quot; Nick said and got out a vial containing a purple liquid. Kate looked questioningly at him. Nick poured a little bit of the liquid onto Trevor's hand and Trevor jumped up and screamed in pain as the liquid burned through his skin. Kate quickly reached for a napkin and tried to dab off the wound.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you do?&quot; She asked Nick accusingly, who looked completely unrepentant. His smile had only grown.<br>
<br>
&quot;Captain Page thought it would be better if we didn't let you in on that little detail,&quot; he responded and motioned to Trevor with his head. &quot;Take a look at your perfect boyfriend now.&quot; Kate stared wide-eyed at Trevor, who had shrunk down to no more than half a foot tall and now had pointy ears.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my God,&quot; she said under her breath. Nick reached over and picked him up, stealthily putting him in a silver briefcase he had brought with them for that precise purpose. A waiter hurried over to the table.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is anything wrong here?&quot; He asked. Nick smiled and shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think our friend had a reaction to something in the food, so he went to use the restroom,&quot; Nick smoothly lied. &quot;Unfortunately, we've just been called back to work. If he comes back, tell him lunch was on me,&quot; he said as he placed a fifty dollar bill on the table. The waiter nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;No problem sir,&quot; the waiter replied. He could ignore the scream he just heard knowing that it meant a sizeable tip for him. Nick and Kate walked out to the car. Kate sat with her arms crossed the entire ride back to the station.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aw, don't be mad,&quot; Nick said.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're enjoying this aren't you?&quot; She asked pointedly. He smiled and tilted his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But not as much as if I had just been able to kill him.&quot; Kate shook her head in frustration and stared out the window.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's a good guy Nick,&quot; she finally said. He grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's a link Kate,&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe it doesn't matter.&quot; Her luck with guys had been very poor lately. It was almost as if someone had put the word out not to go near her. Then, she met Trevor, and she thought her luck was turning around. She knew she shouldn't blame Nick, it wasn't his fault that Trevor was a link, but he didn't have to be so smug about it. Nick, on the other hand, couldn't believe the words that had just come out of her mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?!&quot; He practically yelled in disbelief. &quot;How can you say it doesn't matter?&quot; He pulled the car over and they stepped out, walking into the drycleaners front. &quot;Kate, you're not thinking rationally.&quot; She refused to look at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not thinking rationally? Trevor is the first guy I've met in a long time that has actually liked me and treated me decently. He's the first guy who has bothered to send me flowers and.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;God, you didn't sleep with him did you?&quot; Nick interrupted. &quot;Please tell me you didn't sleep with him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not yet, but I would have,&quot; she responded. He grimaced and made a face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Geez Kate, if you were that desperate, I would have.&quot; he stopped talking when he received a harsh glare from her eyes. He shrugged it off and smiled. &quot;Of course, I would have anyway.&quot; Kate's mouth dropped open to make a comment but quickly closed in confusion.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;So, you're saying that you don't know anything about what's going down on St. Patrick's Day?&quot; Captain Page asked Trevor. He had been returned to his human size, but was in restraints.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lots of people getting drunk and wearing green,&quot; Trevor answered with a smirk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why do I think he knows more than that?&quot; Nick asked. Trevor smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're looking a little green yourself there boy-o.&quot; Nick didn't fail to catch Trevor's meaning, as green was the color associated with jealousy. He nodded once and smiled back.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know the nice thing about that problem?&quot; Nick asked and Trevor raised an eyebrow. Nick raised his gun and aimed it at Trevor's head. &quot;It's easily solvable.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;O'Malley!&quot; Page called him to him, but he just looked at him briefly through the corner of his eye. Nick lowered his weapon.<br>
<br>
&quot;You never let me have any fun,&quot; Nick grumbled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Information first, then you can kill him,&quot; Page retorted. A broad smile came over Nick's mouth. He nodded and smirked at Trevor.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is shaping up to be my lucky day,&quot; he quipped. Trevor rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't suppose I get to see Kate any time soon?&quot; He asked. Page stared blankly at him in disbelief and Nick scowled.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; they both answered. Page turned to O'Malley.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe I should let you handle the interrogation alone for a while,&quot; he said. Trevor winced when he saw the almost evil look spread across Nick's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good idea sir,&quot; Nick responded in a cheery tone. He watched Captain Page leave the room and shut the door behind him, and then he turned around to face Trevor. &quot;So, there's the easy way or the hard way.&quot; Trevor raised an eyebrow skeptically.<br>
<br>
&quot;The easy way is?&quot; He asked. Nick smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You tell me what I want to know and then I kill you,&quot; he said in a happy voice. Trevor frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dare I ask what the hard way is?&quot; He watched Nick shrug.<br>
<br>
&quot;The hard way is that I just kill you and don't get the information,&quot; Nick retorted. Trevor furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;How is either of those easy for me?&quot; He asked. Nick chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't say for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think Kate will forgive you if you kill her boyfriend,&quot; Trevor grinned. Nick shrugged again and aimed his gun.<br>
<br>
&quot;She has before,&quot; Nick said with a straight face. Trevor went pale.<br>
<br>
&quot;How about a different deal, one where I don't end up dead at the end?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know, that doesn't sound like much fun.&quot; Nick lowered his gun, but still kept it ready to fire.<br>
<br>
&quot;I tell you what you want to know and you let me see Kate,&quot; Trevor said.<br>
<br>
&quot;No deal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am still her boyfriend you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Somehow I doubt that,&quot; Nick said. &quot;Kate's really big on the whole honesty thing and you, well, you're a leprechaun. And, maybe it's just me, but she seemed kind of surprised by that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She was angrier with you about that if I recall correctly,&quot; Trevor grinned. Nick cocked his head to the side and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, but she knows me,&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
Trevor finally gave in and told Nick what they needed to know, he figured they couldn't stop it now anyway, but only on the condition that he got to see Kate. Nick only agreed to the deal after Page forced him to. There was a light rap on the door and then Kate entered. He raised his eyebrow at her and she grinned. Kate patted Nick on the shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's okay,&quot; she said. He nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;You want me to stay?&quot; He asked. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I got it,&quot; she said and he opened the door. &quot;But stay nearby just in case,&quot; she threw over her shoulder. She sat down across from Trevor. &quot;So.&quot; He grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wanted to tell you Kate,&quot; he said. His voice sounded honest, but then, even Carl could sound honest when he wanted to.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why didn't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, believe it or not, but there aren't that many attractive women who actually believe that leprechauns even exist.&quot; He gave a self-deprecating laugh. &quot;I thought you'd try to have me committed.&quot; Kate laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess that's true,&quot; she agreed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where does this leave us then?&quot; He asked. She sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I like you Trevor, but.&quot; She shook her head. He nodded in understanding and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Promise me you'll call if things don't work out with him?&quot; He asked. She opened her mouth to speak, but quickly shut it and smiled instead. Two officers took him away to lock-up and Kate sat back down at her desk. Nick looked over at her, a little concerned.<br>
<br>
&quot;You okay?&quot; He asked. She smiled and nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she answered. He looked at her questioningly, taking in the expression on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;If I didn't know you any better, I'd say you have another guy waiting for you,&quot; he said. Her smile grew wider and his mouth dropped open. &quot;So you're gonna tell me who he is right?&quot; He smiled and she shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ka-te!&quot; He drew out her name in exasperation.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; she smiled smugly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have to tell me. I think we've all seen what happens when you don't tell me,&quot; Nick said in a bemused voice. She laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Trevor said if it doesn't work out with him that I should give him a call,&quot; Kate said. Nick's smile fell a little and Kate kept laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not funny.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not,&quot; he insisted. She finally stopped laughing and smiled at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pizza?&quot; She asked, getting up from her chair. He followed her lead and got up from his chair as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Only if you tell me who the guy is,&quot; he said in a bribing tone. She rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll see.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The End<br>
<br>
If you made it this far, please review. This was my first SU2 fic. I'd like to know if I should bother to write others. Thanks! <br>
