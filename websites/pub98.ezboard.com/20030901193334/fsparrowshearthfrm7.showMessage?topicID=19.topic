<br>
I've been studying the history of the Eucharist for a few weeks now, and finding history is largely against my Baptist view that the Lord's Supper is only symbolic.<br>
<br>
Respected early church fathers like Irenaeus, Ignatius, Justin Martyr, Tertullian and others spoke strongly on bread and wine being the literal body and blood of Christ, and spoke against them only being symbols.<br>
<br>
In the history of the church, there was really no other view (other than the bread and wine being literally Christ's flesh and blood) until the Reformation. And even here, I got a big surprise: even Luther held to the literal view, and argued intensely against other Protestants (like Zwingli) who can adopted the symbolic view.<br>
<br>
Even in scripture, I find my &quot;symbolic&quot; view falling away. In John 6, which I've read a hundred times before, I now see that Christ repeatedly affirms we are to eat his flesh and drink his blood. All the disciples have a hard time with this, and for obvious reasons. Many disciples even leave Christ over this, and when they leave, Christ *doesn't* say &quot;I'm just being symbolic, come back guys!&quot; - instead, he *repeats* his words, and then asks the apostles if they are going to leave to. This is difficult text from me to read and accept literally, but when I apply the &quot;grammatical, historical&quot; method of interpretation, I am left with little choice. John 6:55 especially - where Christ is making it the point that he's NOT being symbolic.<br>
<br>
Now I just have to figure out what to do about it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Since my church does not believe in the literal body and blood in the Lord's Supper, and I'm starting to believe in the literal presence, should I refrain from partaking of our Baptist communion until I sort this out for myself? I don't want to partake in an &quot;unworthy manner&quot;.<br>
<br>
God bless,<br>

<br>
I rmember discussing this with those who take the symbolic view, and they point to the Gospels' account of the Last Supper where Jesus shares the bread and wine.  When you examine the original Greek, at this point Christ does, in fact, say something more along the lines of &quot;this is, as it were, my body&quot;... etc.  At the Last Supper, Jesus was actually speaking metaphorically, and this is the argument of many who see communion as symbolic.  However, when considered on a temporal basis, this makes sense.  Jesus had not yet been crucified, the sacrifice had not yet occured, so at that time the bread and wine was just that, bread and wine.  But when, as you rightly pointed out, John 6 is taken into account we see the whole picture.  It all must be combined.  Jesus tells us in John 6 that His body is true food and His blood is true drink.  Then we go to the last supper as see what we are to use for all time when we gather to remember His sacrifice.  After His sacrifice, the miracle will be that the bread and wine is the body and blood.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I kind of rambled there.  It is a hard thing to come to grips with, but as I have believed this since my first communion when I was 7, I just see it as what is. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

As Orthodox I believe that at the Eucharist, which Orthodox will refer to as the Divine Liturgy, that not only is Christ present and we eat and drink his flesh and blood, but the whole Church is present, in both time and space.  That is why in an Orthodox Temple there are ikons of the Saints on all the walls, they bare witness to the fact that as Saints who have received their reward are also part of this great Communion.   And as in Revelation they are praying for the Church still in her struggles.  A hint about reading Revelation St John the Revelator received his vision on the Lord's Day, and what the vision setting was, was the Eucharist at the Divine Liturgy.<br>
Below is my favorite hymn; The Cherubic Hymn, sung at the Great Enterance where the gifts of the bread and the wine are brought to the Altar.<br>

I don't know how you get from John 6:55 that Jesus is &quot;NOT being symbolic.&quot;  It is a metaphor.  This is evident to me from vs. 63.<br>
<br>

63 &quot;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Let's continue where you left off at verse 58.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>John 6:59-71<br>
59 This he said in the synagogue, as he taught at Caper'na-um.<br>
60 Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, &quot;This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?&quot;<br>
61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, &quot;Do you take offense at this?<br>
62 Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before?<br>
63 It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.<br>
64 But there are some of you that do not believe.&quot; For Jesus knew from the first who those were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray him.<br>
65 And he said, &quot;This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.&quot;<br>
66 After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him.<br>
67 Jesus said to the twelve, &quot;Do you also wish to go away?&quot;<br>
68 Simon Peter answered him, &quot;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life;<br>
69 and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.&quot;<br>
70 Jesus answered them, &quot;Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?&quot;<br>
71 He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was to betray him.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
In verse 60 we have the followers reacting to the statement, finding it hard to comprehend, and to be fair, rightly so.<br>
In verse 61, Jesus asks them outright if they have a problem with what He said.<br>
Verse 62 has Jesus describe another thing that is true that will also be a miraculous thing that He will do... ascend into Heaven.  Jesus did this.  Really did this.  Still no metaphor.<br>
Verse 63 - the one you quote - isn't saying that he's speaking metaphically.  Look at a more modern translation - &quot;It is the Spirit who gives eternal life. Human effort accomplishes nothing. And the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.&quot; NLT.  Essentially saying salvation is by faith.  He's comparing having faith in the saving spirit with faith in His words, which are hard.<br>
This is evidenced as He goes onto verse 64, saying quite clearly that there will be those who won't believe.<br>
Verse 65 is simply stating that no one actually can believe without it being granted by the Father.  God's grace must enable them to have faith.  A fairly popular verse with those of the Reformed persuasion, but not irreconcilable with Catholic teaching.<br>
Verses 66 to 71 simply state that many left Him that day, except for the 12, one of whom would betray Him.<br>

Ironically I had a rather interesting debate with an independent Baptist who said that the Catholics screw up the interpretation of the Bible by looking at everything allegorically.  Now, according to this, we mess it up by taking a part of it grammatically/historically.  Ah, well.

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Epistle of St. Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyrnaeans</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>6:1Let no man be deceived. Even the heavenly things, and the glory of the angels, and the principalities, both visible and invisible, if they believe not on the blood of Christ, for them also is there condemnation. Let him who receiveth it, receive it in reality. Let not high place puff up any man. For the whole matter is faith and love, to which there is nothing preferable. <br>
6:2 Consider those who hold heretical opinions with regard to the grace of Jesus Christ which hath come unto us, how opposite they are to the mind of God. They have no care for love, nor concerning the widow, nor concerning the orphan, nor concerning the afflicted, nor concerning him who is bound or loosed, nor concerning him who is hungry or thirsty. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>They refrain from the eucharist and from prayer, because they do not confess that the eucharist is the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father of his goodness raised up.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
St Ignatius was ordained by St John the Evangelist, so he should know what the Gospel of John meant at 6:55, and he writes that those who do not confess the eucharist is the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, as heretical opinions.  The confession of the Church, as Brian has pointed out, has always been the Eucharist is the Body and Blood of Our Lord, the novel doctrine of it being symbolic only came in the 1500's, and even then not all the reformers went that direction.  The Lutherans and Anglicans both believe that the Eucharist is the Body and Blood of Our Lord.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For the first thousand years of Christian history, when the Church was visibly one and undivided, the holy gifts of the Body and Blood of Christ were received as just that: His Body and Blood.

<br>
I've been reading more on this, as I have never viewed communion as anything other than a service in  'remembrance' of Christ.  I enjoy studying from <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Matthew Henry's Commentaries</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and thought you might find his words interesting on this topic too: (he wrote several pages, but I'll shorten it here)<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What is meant by the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>flesh and the blood of Christ</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  It is called (John 6:53) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the flesh of the Son of man, and his blood.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  It is said to be given for the life of the world, that is, First, Instead of the life of the world, which was forfeited by sin, Christ gives his own flesh as a ransom.  Secondly, In order to the life of the world,  to purchase a general offer of eternal life to all the world.  So that the flesh and blood of the Son of man denote Christ and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>him crucified,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and the redemption wrought out by him.  The promises of the covenant, and eternal life;  these are called the flesh and the blood of Christ.<br>
<br>
1.  Because they are purchased by the breaking of his body, and the sheddidng of his blood.  2.  Because they are meat and drink to our souls.  He had before compared himself to bread, which is necessary food;  here to flesh, which is delicious.  It is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>meat indeed, and drink indeed;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  in opposition to the shows and shadows with which the world shams off those that feed upon it.<br>
<br>
What is meant by eating this flesh and drinking this blood.  It is certain that it means neither more nor less than believing in Christ.  Believing in Christ includes these four things, which eating and drinking do:  First, it implies an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>appetite</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to Christ.  This spiritual eating and drinking begins with hungering and thirsting (Matt. v.6)  &quot;Give me Christ or else I die&quot;.  Secondly, An <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>application</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of Christ to ourselves.  Meat looked upon will not nourish us, but meat fed upon.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We must so accept of Christ as to appropriate him to ourselves.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Thirdly,  A delight in Christ and his salvation.  The doctrine of Christ crucified must be meat and drink to us, most pleasant and delightful.  Fourthly, A <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>derivation of nourishment</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> from him and a dependence upon him for the support and comfort of our spiritual life, and the strength, growth, and vigour of the new man.<br>
<br>
When afterwards he would institute some outward sensible signs, by which to represent our communicating of the benefits of his death, he chose those of eating and drinking, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>and made them sacramental actions. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I've been aware of the two views for a while, and honestly, it isn't such a leap for me to believe that Christ is 'within' the bread and wine.  Here's why...<br>
<br>
we are talking about a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>sacrament</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, a way in which we receive God's grace towards Christian growth/sanctification (for lack of a better more thought-out definition)...and in this view, I have always considered that I am 'communing' with Jesus Christ when I partake of the Lord's Supper.  Even in my view of this service as a 'remembering' our Lord's sacrifice, I still yet believe in a living God that continually fills us with his spirit.<br>
<br>
A study on the fullness on the Holy Spirit led me to certainty that being 'filled' with the Holy Spirit as a believer is NOT a one time occurance, it is an on-going process....which has led me to a better understanding of what a 'sacrament' is.<br>
<br>
<br>

Essentially it is true, but there are some differences.<br>
<br>
Roman Catholics believe in transubstantiation, which is defined as this:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;According to this position, the substance, or inner reality, of the bread and wine are changed into the substance of the body and blood of Christ, but the accidents, or external qualities known through the senses (color, weight, taste), remain unchanged.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>

<br>
Luthernas and Anglicans believe in consubstantiation, which is defined as this:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Consubstantiation rests on the same philosophical assumptions as the medieval doctrine of transubstantiation, which it opposed. Both doctrines depend on Aristotle's teaching that matter consists of accidents, which can be perceived by the senses, and substance, which the mind grasps and which constitutes essential reality. Both agree that, in the Eucharist, the accidents of the bread and wine remain unchanged. Unlike the doctrine of transubstantiation, however, that of consubstantiation asserts that the substance of the bread and wine is also unchanged, the ubiquitous body of Christ coexisting &quot;in, with, and under&quot; the substance of the bread, and the blood of Christ in, with, and under the wine, by the power of the Word of God.<br>
<br>
Luther illustrated consubstantiation by the analogy of iron put into fire: Iron and fire are united in red-hot iron; yet the two substances remain unchanged.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

I know that Orthodoxy holds to the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but does not accept the terminology of Rome, that is transubstantiation.  Yet they also don't claim consubstantiation either, from what I can tell.  Jeff, you can correct me here if I'm wrong.<br>
<br>
Anway, as can be seen, Roman Catholics, Orthodox, and the very earliest Protestant churches (Lutheran and Anglican), hold to some degree the presence of our Lord in the Eucharist.  It is not just a symbolic gesture done in remembrance, it is a very meaningful sacrament.<br>
<br>
I don't say that to be condescending, but it is worthwhile to know that a large portion of Christendom accepts this doctrine and it can be traced back to the ECF who saw this as truth.  They took John 6 to be literally such.  There is scriptural, historical and traditional reasons to accept this doctrine.<br>
<br>
I will also admit that it is one of the largest stumbling blocks to Christian unity, almost as severe as debates on the doctrines of Grace.<br>
<br>
In a final note to Brian.  I can understand why you might be starting to feel uncomfortable taking communion in a church that only considers it to be symbolic.  I attend a non-denominational Christian church with my wife, who is VERY protestant.  While she isn't quite sure that communion is only symbolic, she isn't to your point yet.  Anyway, even though the Roman Catholic church states that I am not to take communion outside, I have.  I'm not sure what happens though.  I still take it in full reverence, and I am willing to take it as bread and wine only as an act of unity with Christian brothers and sisters.  However, I can't deny the possibility that the mystery takes place because of my faith.  If it does, it does.<br>
<br>
I'm probably saying all that very inadequately.   I hope I haven't confused this discussion.<br>
 <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

wow.  I had no idea the beliefs were so meticulously defined here...   maybe it is just my naivete, but I've not been so boggled down by these details (maybe thankfully so!  I didn't know it was an issue of such controversy).<br>
<br>
To my mind, God is creator of ALL things both seen and unseen.  Knowing this, I believe He is evident in ALL things (Romans 1:20) which includes the bread and the wine.  What makes this particular creation -the wheat, the grapes- separte and holy is that Christ has deemed it as such at the Last Supper. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeffthefinn>jeffthefinn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://webpages.charter.net/nilus/finnbutton.GIF" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your Friendly<br>Orthodox Resource</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#B87333>(6/27/03 12:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/nilus/jfinn.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eucharist</span><hr size=1> The Orthodox refer to the Eucharist as the Holy Mysteries, we do not define but know that when we eat and drink we are in reality eating and drinking Our Lord's Body and Blood.<br>
