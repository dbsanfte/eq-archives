<br>
“So, what? Is this the place?”<br>
<br>
“That’s what the ghouls said.”<br>
<br>
Crowley and Vicious stood in the upscale late-dining restaurant on the outskirts of San Diego. This was where the damned Sabbat ghouls Crowley had interrogated in Santa Carla had lead them.  <br>
<br>
Crowley summoned his new-found powers of Auspex. It was like seeing the world through new eyes. Every detail of the room suddenly became clear. The emotions of the occupants became tangible. Their life forces….<br>
<br>
Crowley’s attention turned to a young woman. She was beautiful, of what seemed to be of mixed Anglo-Latino heritage. She didn’t look like she could’ve been older than 20, though based on what his senses were telling him, appearances really didn’t mean much.  <br>
<br>
“Vicious, that woman. Check her out.”<br>
<br>
Vicious turned his head and looked at the woman. “Yeah, she’s fine, Crowley. No question about that. But, uh… that’s not why we’re here.”<br>
<br>
Despite himself, Crowley could not keep the irritation out of his hushed voice. “I meant her aura.” <br>
<br>
“Oh.” Vicious replied. “Right. I knew that.”<br>
<br>
“Perhaps its time we introduced ourselves to one of the locals.” <br>
<br>
Crowley and Vicious struck up a conversation with the young woman. Within a few minutes, and with some well-chosen words and the discreet use of a few disciplines, they had confirmed that the woman’s name was Juana, and that she was the childe of the quarry, Joseph Stein. Her Sire, who had many havens, was away right now on Sabbat business. Juana made her own haven in the apartment above the restaurant, and handled the night to night running of the place.    <br>
 <br>
Crowley found a chance to pull Vicious aside for a moment and lowered his voice.<br>
<br>
 “Vicious, this is the perfect opportunity. I don’t think she’s bound to him. Tell you what, you go check out those other leads, and I’ll see what I can find out about Stein’s operation from her. By the time you get back, I should have him safely under wraps. Then we can do what we want to him.”<br>
<br>
Vicious grinned. “Good idea, Crowley! You bag the babe, I'll go find something flammable!&quot; He ran off into the night before Crowley could respond.<br>
<br>
Crowley stood agape for a full second before recovering. He didn’t know whether to be pissed at Vicious for saying something like that within earshot of Juana… or amused. He finally decided on the latter. Being away from Santa Carla changed things; suddenly the emphasis was no longer the petty squabbles and deal-making of Elysium but on their mission. The Sabbat. The enemy. If left to their own devices, those monsters would rise up and consume the world. They would bring about the very Gehenna they claimed to combat. Crowley knew he had to do everything he could to prevent that. <br>
 <br>
Crowley turned back to Juana and smiled. He looked deeply into her beautiful eyes. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“Please forget what my friend just said.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> He commanded. The look of surprise that had been on her face vanished and was once again replaced by a delightful smile. Crowley’s voice now dripped honey as he gazed longingly into her eyes. “Now please, tell me more about yourself. How exactly did you meet Mr. Stein?”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Of course,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Crowley thought, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>One’s duty to the Camarilla doesn’t preclude one from mixing business with pleasure.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vicious@scbnforum58570>Vicious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FF9300>(6/5/03 4:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Misadventures of Crowley and Vicious - Part 1</span><hr size=1> &quot;Good idea, Crowley! You bag the babe, I'll go find something flammable!&quot;<br>
<br>
Vicious spun around and jogged off. It had been a long, mostly boring drive, but here he was. San Diego. Sabbat land. Of course, there were advantages to being here. One of them being the ability to actually kill other vampires. He hadn’t done that in… well…. ever. Sure, he had seen them killed, but he was never the lucky one who struck the final blow. Bah.<br>
<br>
But now came the fun part. Finding something flammable! No, wait. Vicious was on a mission.  Nothing fancy like “You must save the world from Gehenna! Oh no!” or “You must save the Prince from the Sabbat! Oh no!”, but more like “You must save us ALL from the Sabbat! Oh yes!” This promised to be fun and entertaining, if not a bit on the stressful side. Regardless, one could always find Sabbat if one knew where to look, and if there was one group of antitribu that Vicious knew well, it was the Toreador. He loved those crazy motherfuckers.<br>
<br>
Sheer luck. Vicious had found himself a lovely BDSM club fifteen minutes down the street from the restaurant. Talk about convenient! Vicious looked down. Dressed in a messy suit with the button-up untucked, he looked more like he’d been hit by a car recently. That wasn’t really the type of environment one wore this kind of clothes in. But where could he find clothing to match the locale?<br>
<br>
Screw it. No one would care what he was wearing so long as he was willing to punch someone. Or whip them.Or cane them. Or who knows what else. Vicious paid the cover charge and headed inside. About ten seconds later he regretted it, as some random woman descended on him and started trying to claw him out of his clothing right in the middle of what looked like some kind of lobby. There was a lot of black leather, and a lot of flashing lights, and this amounted to what could’ve been a huge headache if Vicious hadn’t toned down his enhanced sight. And the music. Sweet father in hell! The horrible, horrible music! It sounded like a cat trying to go to the bathroom through a sewn up anus…. Not that Vicious knew what that sounded like. A moment of staring at this woman revealed her to be mortal. Vicious firmly removed her. She started to approach again when stopped her with a glare and slowly drew back his sleeve, revealing his knife sheaths. Her eyes got wide for a moment, and she quickly ran off. Vicious knew she’d be summoning a bouncer or some guy in a gimp suit to remove him from the club…. Or maybe violate him in ways that he thought weren’t possible for a human, but he didn’t need that much time. He just needed to (hopefully) find a vampire and get out. Vicious wandered around the main areas, staring intently at people. Some stared back. Others left in digust. One grabbed him by the crotch and started shaking. That was disturbing and painful. However, in five minutes of searching, he’d found nothing, and a very large and scary-looking fellow was approaching him at speeds rivalling that of a person walking really fast. Vicious smiled at the man as he approached, rounded a corner that led into a hallway which hopefully led either out or into some kind of private room area where he could hide, and burst into Celerity, clearing the hallway and ducking into an empty room.<br>
<br>
Or so he thought!<br>
<br>
Wait…. Nope. It was empty. <br>
<br>
Vicious ducked behind a chair…. A chair with straps… ick…. And waited. Footsteps walked by, but did not enter. Vicious waited. Then he got bored and left the room, eager to engage in a proper battle to the death with any number of massive bouncers. Stepping into the hallway, he ran straight into a woman wearing knee-high boots and a leather one-piece. Vicious stared at her for a second before his mind caught up with his defunct sex-drive. Libido later!<br>
<br>
“Welcome to The Whip. Can I help you in any way?” the woman asked. Vicious cocked his head to the side. That was unexpected.<br>
<br>
“Uhhh… yeah. I’m looking for the room with the knives and the cutting and the bleeding.” He replied. The two of them stared at one another for about twenty seconds before the woman smiled.<br>
<br>
“Yes, of course. Right this way, sir.” She said, turning and walking off. Vicious blinked before starting off after her. What were the chances? A few moments later, Vicious stood in front of a door, with another bouncer-type standing guard. The woman looked at Vicious and once again smiled.<br>
<br>
“For reasons of safety, Richard will have to…. Frisk you.” She said. Vicious smiled and looked directly into her eyes.<br>
<br>
“No he doesn’t.” He said cooly. The woman blinked, and then smiled again.<br>
<br>
“Yes he does.”<br>
<br>
Damnit! He hadn’t spontaneously developed Dominate! That threw his entire plan of attack into turmoil! Vicious faced Richard and waited as he removed Vicious’ staff  and knives from his clothing. This could not be allowed. Vicious nodded at the hostess, who smiled, turned, and went off to do something more interesting. Vicious turned and pointed at his staff.<br>
<br>
“Whatever you do, don’t hold this end to your head and push the button.” He said. Richard glared at him.<br>
<br>
“Nice try.” Vicious smiled, “It was, wasn’t it?”. Then he slammed his hand out and pushed the button. The staff extended and hit Richard in the foot, causing him to drop it. Vicious caught it in mid-air and swung around, catching Richard on the temple and slamming him against the wall. Richard slumped into Vicious’ already waiting arms, where he was dragged into a room containing a bed…. With straps…. And left on the ground. Vicious returned to the room and entered, fully armed and ready to go.<br>
<br>
The room was spacious, containing all kinds of great furniture. Some of it didn’t even have straps. A lone woman with pale white skin and red hair in a red silk gown lay sprawled across a couch, staring thoughtfully at the door, which now contained Vicious. He stared back, and after a moment, her pale aura melted into view. Finally. One of those freaky Sabbat dominatrixes. Fun! The woman didn’t seem as happy to see him, though.<br>
<br>
“Did you kill him, or just beat him up a bit?” she asked. Vicious shrugged.<br>
<br>
“He was in the way.” He said. She sat up and stretched.<br>
<br>
“So, are you here to try to kill me or something?” she asked. Vicious once again shrugged. He wasn’t in the mood for interrogation right now, and really just wanted to get some info as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
“Not unless you give me a reason to. I’m looking for other vampires. Care to fill me in?” Vicious hoped that his straight-to-the-point manner would make this go faster. He really wanted to go back and see how Crowley was doing. If worst came to worst, he didn’t know if Crowley could hold his own in a fight, and damnit, Vicious kinda liked the guy! The woman had already stood up and was approaching him, staring at him intently.<br>
<br>
“Is that all you’re looking for?” The woman said. Vicious glared. That did it.<br>
<br>
“Look, I’m in a hurry and I don’t have time for games. Can you help me out or not?” Vicious snarled. This was taking too long, and so far it had only taken about a minute.<br>
<br>
“So you’re not in the mood to….pla…. hey!” the woman stopped as Vicious just turned around and started to walk out. “I haven’t got the time or inclination for this. I’ll get my info elsewhere.”<br>
<br>
“Look, if you’re interested in joining us, you can’t just walk in here and…ccchhhhh” Vicious had blurred back and now had his hand around her throat, slowly lifting her up and glaring into her eyes.<br>
<br>
“I can do whatever the fuck I want. Now are you going to tell me what I want to know, or am I going to set you on fire? I hear you Sabbat have much more lax rules regarding destruction than that stupid Camarilla does, you annoying bitch.” Fear suddenly became apparent in her expression and Vicious dropped her, drawing a knife from its sheath and stabbing suddenly, barely pricking the end of her nose. She lost it.<br>
<br>
“Alright, alright! If you go downtown, there’s a theater called “Five Star”. Right next to it is a big apartment complex. You can’t miss it. Go to apartment #32 and tell them that Kendra sent you. They’ll give you the information you need. Now please go away!”<br>
<br>
Vicious smiled. Sure, it might be a trap, but Vicious was just as good at avoiding them as he was at setting them. He turned and left. That was one errand out of the way….<br>
<br>
As he left, the woman spoke one last time…<br>
<br>
“You’re pretty accurate with that knife of yours.”<br>
<br>
“I was aiming for your eye.”<br>

<br>
“You know what your sire has planned for you, don’t you?”<br>
<br>
Crowley and Juana lay sprawled naked in bed in Juana’s apartment above the restaurant, their clothes strewn all over the floor. They had shared each other’s blood, and neither had any immediate desire to leave the other. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mission be damned.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Crowley thought. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I’ll take Stein’s childe, and have his head.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“When the time is right, he’s going to present you to one of the local packs. He will make a gift out of you.” Crowley’s voice dripped concern as he caressed the woman wrapped in his arms. “They will take you into their Vaulderie. You’ll be like a slave to them.”  He gently tipped her chin until she faced him. “They will use you to kill and destroy and pillage. They will use you to rape and subvert. When they are finished, there will be nothing left of you but the Beast that rages within.”<br>
<br>
Crowley looked at her with as much compassion as he could summon. “Is that what you want?”<br>
<br>
She gazed back at him. “Can you stop it from happening?”<br>
<br>
He smiled slyly. “If you let me try.”<br>
<br>
Suddenly Crowley heard a crashing noise from inside the apartment. Before he could react, a man appeared in the doorway of the bedroom. He was dressed entirely in black with a long black jacket that came down to his knees. That wasn’t what Crowley noticed the most about him, however. That would be the long, shadowy tentacles emanating from his being. Also catching Crowley’s eye was that the man appeared very, very angry. <br>
<br>
Crowley maintained his composure and focused his will. “Ah, Mr. Stein. I’ve been expecting you. Won’t you please have a seat, and don’t move or attack anyone.”<br>
<br>
If Stein hadn’t been angry before, he was angry now. <br>
<br>
With a roar, tentacles wrapped around Crowley, ripping him out of the bed. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Crap. Crowley thought. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I’ve met someone with thicker blood than m</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
 <br>
By the time he finished that thought, Crowley body had been smashed against the wall. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Got to get my feet under me… my only chance…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Stein had other ideas. <br>
<br>
An instant later, Crowley had been smashed THROUGH the wall. Fortitude aside, Stein was starting to do some damage. Some subconscious region of Crowley’s brain told him he was now in the kitchen of Juana’s apartment. Another subconscious region told him he had just heard Juana yelling something at her Sire, only to be knocked out of the way. A very conscious region of Crowley’s mind felt the black tentacles, and then actual hands, wrapping around his neck. <br>
<br>
Crowley knew that he couldn’t be strangled. He didn’t even have to breathe. Somehow, that wasn’t making him feel better at the moment, and Crowley could feel himself losing consciousness as he was being driven into torpor and most assuredly Final Death…<br>
<br>
Suddenly Crowley heard a loud THUMP! He glanced up to see Vicious, staff in hand, standing over a woozy Joseph Stein.<br>
<br>
“Hey, Crowley.” Vicious grinned. “Need any help?”<br>

Come forth! Thus commands ZUUL!” Vicious yelled, attracting the attention of every other employee and patron of the restaurant.That accomplished nothing, however, as Crowley was nowhere to be found. Increasing his range of hearing, he heard something that sounded like… hmmm… crashing… and… oh hell.<br>
<br>
Vicious turned and ran outside, up the steps to the apartment above the restaurant, and slammed his foot into the door, cracking the center and causing the door to break off the top hinge. Tearing a large piece of the door off, Vicious ran in the direction of what sounded like some woman screaming something, and another crash. A much bigger crash. Hey, maybe Crowley had just sent that fucker through a… nope.<br>
<br>
What looked like a hentai tentacle rape nightmare was slowly advancing on what looked like a naked Crowley, and there was a naked screaming spanish chick in the bed. Vicious glared at the woman. It was that Juana bitch. She’d set Crowley up. He lunged at her, smashing her face with his left hand while slamming his stake into her chest with the other. The punch itself was enough to knock her off the bed onto the floor, where she lay completely motionless, the stake having done its job. Vicious turned to see the Lasombra trying to choke Crowley to death. What a moron. Vicious jumped into the air, launching himself at the back of the Lasombra, and clubbed him with the handle of his staff. The vampire fell backwards and off of Crowley. Vicious extended the staff and placed it behind his neck, using it to support his arms in a relaxed position. <br>
<br>
“Hey Crowley. Need any help?” Vicious asked as the Lasombra stood up and snarled something in Spanish. Vicious doesn’t speak Spanish, so that won’t be covered here. Deal.<br>
<br>
Vicious heard something cutting the air behind him and spun his staff around, deflecting one tentacle into another before gracefully turning back to face the Lasombra.<br>
<br>
“Look, pal. Despite the fact that you’d like to kill Señor Crowley, that would mean the death of the only Ventrue so far who I don’t want to kill horribly with a butter knife. So if you were to kill him, that would make me angry. You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry!”<br>
<br>
Stein blinked.<br>
<br>
“Shut up, unoriginal little bastard.”<br>
<br>
Vicious glared. “That’s it, asshole. Bring it!”<br>
<br>
Two more tentacles fired out from Vicious left. He dodged back just as he let loose two of his throwing knives, which Stein ducked under as he charged forward, punching at Vicious’ face. Vicious ducked underneath the fist and punched upward, only to miss as Stein fell slightly around Vicious, avoiding the punch and positioning himself behind Vicious. Vicious spun around and swung his staff around, impacting on a shadowy tentacle that had positioned itself between the staff and Stein’s head. Vicious slammed the end of the staff against the wall and let his grip slide up until they had just reached the tentacle, at which point he ran up and along the wall for two steps so that he was facing Stein. Bursting into Celerity, Vicious kicked off the wall at the same time as he slammed his staff into where Stein’s head should have been, but was no longer. Vicious hit the ground, rolled, and lifted his staff in time to block another tentacle that lashed out from in front of him just as everything suddenly went completely black. Vicious heard, at the very last second, something cutting air behind him, and thanks to Celerity was able to duck in time to avoid having his neck stabbed with something sharp. This gave Vicious a direction to attack in, and he did so, missing completely, but clearing himself from the black cloud that hung in the center of the room. Vicious spun around and deflected three more tentacles as they launched themselves toward him, ducking as a fourth splintered the wall behind him. It hovered there for a moment, giving Vicious time to rip a lighter from his jacket pocket, light it, and jam it into the tentacle. It thrashed back and forth before withdrawing, and gave Vicious enough room to dodge Stein’s punch as he appeared out of the shadowy cloud covering most of the room, slamming his fist into the wall and knocking a fist-sized chunk through it. Vicious swung his staff around at Stein’s head, but Stein lifted his other arm and caught it, pulling hard towards himself. Vicious released the staff, allowing Stein to pull it free, and launched himself at Stein, throwing a pair of knives along the way. Stein dodged both knives and ducked as Vicious jumped over him, grabbed his staff and pulled as hard as he could, freeing it from Stein’s distracted grasp, before crashing through the damaged wall and rolling out into the front room, where he spun around and assumed what he assumed was a threatening looking stance. It wasn’t threatening enough.<br>
<br>
Vicious ducked as the four tentacles all stabbed at his head, and barely moved back in time to avoid a fifth tentacle as it suddenly shot out of the ground directly under his face, and then deflected Stein’s kick to the right, rolling clear of Stein as he elbow-dropped onto the position Vicious had been in previously... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stephencrowley>Stephen Crowley</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://lagoon.freebsd.lublin.pl/~fenix/smieci/graf/rozne/vampire/camarilla.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 240<br> <font color=#FF9300>(6/5/03 4:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://people.ucsc.edu/~mcrupp/camarilla.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vicious and Crowley's Excellent Adventure - Part Five</span><hr size=1> “Vicious, take cover!” Crowley was on his feet now, and even better, was partially dressed. Even better than those two, he was pissed off, and eager to return the favor he now owed Vicious. <br>
<br>
Vicious apparently understood exactly what Crowley had in mind. With an absurdly athletic flip, Vicious leapt and practically flew over Crowley’s head, landing safely behind him. It was very fortunate Juana had tall ceilings. <br>
<br>
Crowley’s attention was now focused on Stein. As the Lasombra turned to face the Ventrue, Crowley’s eyes started glowing…<br>
<br>
“Tremble in the presence of my faith, monster!”<br>
<br>
Crowley was vaguely aware of Stein’s shadow-powers wilting. He was partially aware of the once-powerful and seemingly invincible Keeper suddenly cowering before him. He was semiconscious of the fact that his eyes were lit up like light-bulbs, and were projecting the raw power of his faith into the world.<br>
<br>
What Crowley was MOST conscious of was going on inside his head.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This was what you wanted.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> He told himself. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Camarilla against Sabbat. Ventrue against Lasombra. Order against Chaos. He could feel the power of the ancients flowing through him. He had been chosen for this task. He had been given this gift. Now he was using it to best effect. He was doing the work of the Camarilla; pounding the Sabbat back, making the world a little bit safer. The power and elation he felt were absolutely intoxicating…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So why did he feel so incredibly used?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Crowley was suddenly alerted to Vicious shaking him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Crowley! We won, you can stop trying to Dominate the air molecules now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley looked in the corner and saw Joseph Stein staked body, a look of terror still haunted the Lasombra’s face.<br>
<br>
“Oh. Very good.”<br>
<br>

<br>
Vicious looked over to see Crowley standing where the wall Vicious had jumped through had been. He had taken the time to put some pants on, and looked pissed. Vicious was about to slam into Stein when he remebered that whole “Blast ya with Numina” thing. If Crowley could control that…<br>
<br>
Vicious ran forward three steps, activated Celerity once again, and jumped over Crowley, flipping in the air and landing facing Stein. Good thing this apartment had a high ceiling. Vicious landed, pulled his cigarettes out, and lit one.<br>
<br>
“Well, Lord Naughtius of the Tentacle Rape Society, you’re going to die now. Sorry.”<br>
<br>
Vicious noted a nearby chair, pulled a piece off, and turned….<br>
<br>
….and watched as Stein’s arrogant expression turned to one of shock, and then outright fear, but he didn’t run. Rather, he slowly backed away from Crowley, as though waiting for something….<br>
<br>
….that something very likely wasn’t two knives impaling his legs, two more impaling his arms, and a last one landing squarely in his neck. He reeled backward as Vicious blurred forward and slammed the chair leg into Stein’s heart, causing him to fall backwards onto the ground, incapacitated.<br>
<br>
“Booyah! Score one for me and Crowley!” Vicious smiled as he turned around, and then he noticed that Crowley seemed very spaced out.<br>
<br>
“Crowley! We won, you can stop trying to Dominate the air molecules now. “<br>
<br>
“Oh. Very good.”<br>
<br>
“Now grab a leg and help me drag this fucker so we can question him. And find me a blowtorch and some rubbing alcohol, stat!” <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=108.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=108.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm20">SchreckNET™ (Nos only)<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
