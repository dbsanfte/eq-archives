<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“Hey. You up for a run?” The man peered up at the young woman from his char in the hotel suite. He grinned and nodded.<br>
<br>
“I’m surprised you’re inviting me.” The woman rolled her eyes as she tied her dyed blonde hair back into a braid.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, well, I got enough crap from Dad and Bubba about ditching you last time.” She shot him a look. He stood up and shrugged. He was a large man. He was just a little over 6’7” and very athletically muscular. He flashed a knowing smile at her.<br>
<br>
“I’m your bodyguard Bunny, it would have been irresponsible for me not to tell your Dad that you weren’t being protected.” She shook her head and looked back at him through her gray-green eyes.<br>
<br>
“And what exactly are you protecting me from?” She started to stretch out. “Nothing and no one. You’ve been my bodyguard for how long now? Two years almost? And has anyone ever tried to attack me? No.” The man rolled his eyes and crossed his arms.<br>
<br>
“Seems like we’ve had this conversation before.”<br>
<br>
“And yet you never listen. Why is that?” He came over to her to help her stretch out a leg muscle.<br>
<br>
“Even if I quit, like the ones before me did, which I’m thinking had to do with you never obeying their orders for your own safety,” she glared at him. “Okay, even if I quit, you know your Dad is just going to replace me with someone else, just like he always does.” She let out a sigh and nodded.<br>
<br>
“I guess.” He gave her a reassuring grin and a pat on the shoulder.<br>
<br>
“So, indoor running track?” She got a hopeful, yet impish, smile on her face.<br>
<br>
“Foothills?” He glared at her, his previous grin faded.<br>
<br>
“No.” She frowned.<br>
<br>
“Come on, it’s completely safe.” His expression stayed the same, his arms crossed. “I won’t even try to ditch you this time,” she kidded and gave a toothy smile.<br>
<br>
“No.” She narrowed her eyes as she tried to think of a different approach, and then a grin crept across her lips ever so slightly.<br>
<br>
“Well, too bad Grr. We’re going to the foothills. Bubba wanted me to test the new AR prototype.” He furrowed his eyebrows.<br>
<br>
“He didn’t say anything to me about it.”<br>
<br>
“Well, last time I checked, you weren’t in research and development.” She smiled. He looked out the suite’s window and frowned.<br>
<br>
“Don’t you think you’ll get heatstroke or something? It’s still light out, and like a hundred and ten degrees.” She shrugged as she walked to the small refrigerator.<br>
<br>
“So I’ll bring water. You want one?” He closed his eyes for a moment in defeat.<br>
<br>
“Yeah.” She got the water bottles and practically bounced over to him.<br>
<br>
“Hold these, I need to put the prototype on.” She shoved the water bottles at him and went toward the bathroom. He shook his head. Bunny was a very attractive woman in her mid twenties. She wasn’t a traditional plastic surgery beauty; she had what most people referred to as ‘classic beauty’ with strong features. She was smart; one of the top designers at one of her Dad’s subsidiary companies. She had a good sense of humor, although it sometimes was a bit odd. She had a good figure; slim, athletic, but curvy. Around average height at 5’5”. Adrian could easily fall for her if she wasn’t such a pain, and if it wasn’t for her family, who was very protective of her. Her voice snapped him out of his thoughts and he swung around to face her. “Are you ready or what man?” He nodded and went over to the door to the hall where she was standing.<br>
<br>
“Sorry, I guess I just zoned for a second there.” She smiled.<br>
<br>
“Damn. I could have escaped,” she said half jokingly. “I’ll have to start paying more attention.” He rolled his eyes and opened the door for her.<br>
<br>
“You sure you don’t want to run on the indoor track? They’re supposed to have a good one here.” They walked toward the elevator.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I’m sure. It probably smells like smoke too.” She made a disgusted face. “I don’t know what possessed Dad to have a convention here.” Adrian chuckled and they stepped onto the elevator.<br>
<br>
“I’m guessing something to do with the large convention facilities, and the fact that lots of people like to gamble in their personal time.” Bunny laughed.<br>
<br>
“Yeah? I’m guessing something to do with kickbacks. It’s kind of a creepy coincidence that he just happens to know every casino owner in Vegas, don’t you think?” He grinned.<br>
<br>
“Your father is a very wealthy and powerful man, I’m sure that he’s known the owners for some time.”<br>
<br>
“Uh-huh,” she said in a skeptical voice, as she turned around to look out the glass elevator. She scanned the area below and then focused in on something in a darkened corner. She squinted her eyes, trying to get a better look, and then her eyes widened in horror at what she saw. “Oh my God!” She screamed and Adrian rushed to her side to see what she was looking at, but he didn’t see it right away. She lifted a shaking hand to point at what she saw. A man standing over a body, the head separated and hanging from one hand, a butcher’s saw in the other. “Call the police,” she said in a quiet and worried voice.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“Got another one Gris,” Brass said as Grissom and Sara walked up to him. He nodded and made his way over to the body. “Get those people out of here!” Brass yelled to a couple of officers, motioning to the press. This case was the fifth murder in under a month. The press dubbed the killer ‘The Headless Horseman’ because he took the heads of his victims with him. His victims all matched a profile too. Blonde (although it didn’t seem to matter whether it was natural) women in their mid to late twenties, all in good physical condition. No other links were found in their lives. The crime scenes were the worst though, and it was turning into a public relations nightmare. All of them were in very public places, with no evidence left behind except the body; but with no witnesses, at least until now. Brass was very pleased with this latest development, and knew Grissom would be too. He walked over to Grissom.<br>
<br>
“You get rid of the press?” Grissom asked, looking at Brass over his shoulder. Brass nodded.<br>
<br>
“For now.” Grissom turned his head around to face the body again. “Hey Grissom, there’s a witness this time.” This immediately caught both Grissom and Sara’s attention.<br>
<br>
“Who? Where?” Sara asked, excited at the possibility of a break in the case. Brass grinned.<br>
<br>
“Bunny Bouchard,” he said, motioning to her with his head. “As in only daughter of Clayton Bouchard.” Grissom and Sara swung their heads back around to look at him.<br>
<br>
“The billionaire Clayton Bouchard?” Grissom asked in an uneasy tone. Brass nodded.<br>
<br>
“The one and only. Apparently one of his companies is having some sort of convention here this weekend. Ms. Bouchard was on her way to go running in the foothills with her bodyguard,” he motioned toward the handsome athletic man standing near her, “when she saw the killer standing over the body from the glass elevator, head and saw in his hands.”<br>
<br>
Sara cringed. It was one thing to be exposed to that much blood and gore in her line of work, but to have to deal with it from Bunny’s point of view was an entirely different story. She expected that the daughter of one of the richest men in the world probably hadn’t had a lot of exposure to seeing killers or dead bodies. Grissom saw the hesitation on her face.<br>
<br>
“You want me to talk to her?” Sara looked over at him and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“No. I’ll do it.” She started to walk over to Bunny and noticed that her bodyguard stepped guardingly in front of her. She flashed a small smile and raised her identification badge. He frowned, but he stepped aside. “Ms. Bouchard?” Bunny looked over at Sara and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, can I help you?” Despite being obviously a little shaken, Sara noted that Bunny seemed to be handling everything all right, or at least was keeping that appearance. She gave her a grin.<br>
<br>
“Sara Sidle, crime scene investigation unit, can I ask you a couple of questions?” Bunny was staring at the body, but then turned her attention back to Sara.<br>
<br>
“Sure.”<br>
<br>
“I know you already told the police what happened, have they scheduled time with a sketch artist yet?” Bunny shrugged.<br>
<br>
“I’m not sure, they haven’t said anything.” Bunny looked over at Adrian, who placed a reassuring hand on her back.<br>
<br>
“It’s been a difficult last couple of hours, when can she go back to her room?” He asked. Sara gave a partial grin, but it didn’t reach the rest of her face. She thought that even for a bodyguard he was being a little possessive. Bunny shook her head.<br>
<br>
“No. I’m the one who told you to call the police. I’ll talk to them as long as they need me to,” Bunny stated firmly. He gave her a small glare, which Sara figured was not uncommon.<br>
<br>
“Your Dad’s not going to like you being out here like this. You want me to call him?” It definitely sounded like a threat of some kind. Bunny sighed.<br>
<br>
“Well, he’s going to find out about this sooner or later,” she motioned with her hands at the crime scene. “It’s not really something I can hide now is it?” Her voice had a tinge of anger, but mostly despair. He sighed and bowed his head slightly, and then raised his eyes a little to look at her face. He could see the tears starting to well up in her eyes.<br>
<br>
“It’s my fault, I shouldn’t have let you talk me into going to the foothills to run.” He sighed again, running his hand through his short, dark hair. Adrian shook his head. “Your step brother and that damn prototype,” he mumbled. Bunny’s eyes flew wide open in response to what he said. How could she have forgotten?<br>
<br>
“Oh my God! The AR prototype! I completely forgot!” She turned excitedly toward Sara who was watching her with mild confusion. “What kind of operating system does your lab have?” She rushed the words out. Sara furrowed her brow. “You know, what type, model, make, year it was put out, software, anything?”<br>
<br>
“Why?” Sara asked. Grissom came over to the three people when he heard Bunny get so excited.<br>
<br>
“Something wrong?” He asked in his calmest voice possible.<br>
<br>
“The AR prototype. If it worked then you should be able to have a digital shot of the killer on the lens,” Bunny explained. Grissom and Sara exchanged looks.<br>
<br>
“You took pictures of the killer?” Grissom asked to clarify. Bunny shook her head.<br>
<br>
“No, no, no. The … geez. This is going to take way too long to explain, I’ll just have to show you. Is your lab’s operating system compatible with the 12 GP modulator?” Grissom raised his eyebrows. For someone he presumed was just a rich man’s daughter, she seemed to have a lot of knowledge about computers. He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I wish. Our budget isn’t quite that large.” Bunny frowned, but it changed to an excited smile when she saw an angry handsome man arguing with Brass. She waved to him.<br>
<br>
“Ford! Over here!” His face turned in her direction and he walked away from Brass. When he got to her, he embraced her in a large hug. A possessive hug. Grissom and Sara both raised an eyebrow when they looked at each other. Grissom mouthed ‘boyfriend?’. Sara shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Bunny! Thank God! Are you alright?” He pulled away, but kept his hands on her arms.<br>
<br>
“Of course, I’m not the one who was killed,” Bunny shot back in a semi sarcastic manner. She looked at Grissom and Sara. “Oh, sorry. I’m really bad about introductions. This is my step brother Ford Abernathy.” Ford extended a hand to shake each of theirs. She turned back to Ford. “I need a converter for their system to make it compatible with the 12 GP modulator,” she stated. She struck Grissom as a woman who was very used to getting her own way.<br>
<br>
“Why?”<br>
<br>
“Uh…” she paused and looked at Adrian who was arching an eyebrow at her. She sighed and slumped her shoulders a little. “I was testing out my new AR prototype. I was going to take it for a run in the foothills, but then, well, you know.” Ford narrowed his blue eyes at her.<br>
<br>
“You were going running in the foothills?” Ford asked angrily. “What the hell were you thinking? You know Adrian wouldn’t be able to properly protect you by himself in an area that large.”<br>
<br>
“I just wanted to get outside Bubba.” His anger melted a little when she used his nickname. “I hate being trapped inside all the time. It’s boring.” He pulled her into a hug again.<br>
<br>
“I know.” He rubbed her back with one hand. “We just want you to be safe you know. We’re not trying to be mean.” She rolled her eyes and pulled away.<br>
<br>
“I guess.” Grissom was getting a strange vibe from Ford and pursed his lips in thought.<br>
<br>
“Well, look on the bright side,” he interjected. “Now we finally have a witness.”<br>
<br>
<br>

Just remember, I did warn you that this chapter was pretty much background.

He had quickly agreed. Ford told Grissom that he would have a new system, compatible with the AR prototype, delivered to the lab within the next couple of hours. Grissom and Sara made it back to the lab, only to discover that Ford’s people were very fast on delivery. There were boxes of new equipment everywhere, making Sara’s jaw drop at the site.<br>
<br>
“What the …?” Grissom just raised his eyebrows.<br>
<br>
“I guess when the president of the company says to jump, you don’t ask questions,” he reasoned. Sara nodded.<br>
<br>
“I thought they were only going to send over a converter or something,” she shook her head in confusion. Grissom shrugged.<br>
<br>
“I talked to Ford a little when you were with Brass. He said it would be better if we just had a new system, that way we would get the best results.” Greg came bounding out of the lab, his face showing his obvious delight in the situation.<br>
<br>
“When did we get the budget for the entire state?” He joked, his smile practically plastered to his face. Grissom just eyed him.<br>
<br>
“We didn’t. It’s a gift,” Grissom explained. Greg’s eyes grew wide in surprise.<br>
<br>
“A gift? You’re joking right? I’ve only opened one package and…” Grissom furrowed his eyebrows, and picked up one of the delivery slips.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think any of these were addressed to you were they Greg?” Grissom’s statement didn’t faze Greg at all. He just stared at him.<br>
<br>
“It’s from Abernathy Systems Grissom,” he said, explaining to Grissom like he was a child. Grissom cocked an eyebrow and crossed his arms. “Abernathy Systems! Hello! You know how many government contracts those guys have?” He directed his attention toward Sara. It was easier to not have to look at Grissom’s apparent displeasure while he was talking. “And, I’m not just talking military here, think CIA, NSA, and all those other agencies they don’t even admit exist.” Greg clearly looked impressed and Grissom had to hold back a chuckle, though a half grin did find it’s way to his face.<br>
<br>
“I know Greg. It’s a new computer system and related lab equipment.” Greg nodded.<br>
<br>
“I figured it was something like that since what I opened,” he paused and shook his head. “It’s so new I’ve never even read about it.” Grissom and Sara shared a look, wondering what they had gotten themselves into.<br>
<br>
Nick and Warrick walked in to the building, oblivious to the situation in front of them.<br>
<br>
“Hey guys!” Nick greeted with a smile. His demeanor quickly changed to surprise and confusion, as did Warrick’s, when they saw the boxes taking up so much room. “Uh, what’s going on?” Greg got a proud and cocky look on his face, as if he was responsible.<br>
<br>
“New system,” he gloated, standing up straight, he raised his eyebrows once and smiled broadly. Warrick arched an eyebrow at Grissom, who just shook his head slightly.<br>
<br>
“Everybody to my office, I’ll explain there.” Warrick nodded and began to follow, until he read the side of one of the boxes.<br>
<br>
“Abernathy Systems?! Whoa!” He exclaimed, clearly impressed. Grissom sighed and turned around for a moment.<br>
<br>
“My office.” Warrick gave a nod of his head.<br>
<br>
“Right.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Sara and Nick sat down on the two chairs on the other side of Grissom’s desk. Grissom sat down in his. Warrick and Greg stood behind Sara and Nick.<br>
<br>
“So what’s with the boxes Gris?” Nick asked. Grissom gave a half grin.<br>
<br>
“We have a witness in ‘The Headless Horseman’,” he said the name with disdain. He hated when the press assigned nicknames to the killers. It only spurred them on. “Case. A woman saw him from a nearby glass elevator.” Nick, Warrick, and Greg were all pleasantly surprised.<br>
<br>
“That’s great,” Nick said. “Did she get a good look at him?” Sara turned to answer him.<br>
<br>
“That’s where the new system comes in,” she said. He furrowed his eyebrows a little. “Her step brother is Ford Abernathy. Apparently…” Greg cut her off.<br>
<br>
“Ford Abernathy? The president of Abernathy Systems?” Grissom nodded. “That would mean the witness is Bunny Bouchard,” he thought out loud. Grissom looked a little puzzled. Warrick clearly got the implication that Greg was giving.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” Grissom answered. Greg nervously ran his hand over his head.<br>
<br>
“And yet you’re sitting here like this is nothing. Why?” Greg asked. Grissom got a somewhat bemused expression on his face.<br>
<br>
“I know she’s Clayton Bouchard’s daughter Greg, but I never saw you as someone who follows the social pages.” Warrick chuckled.<br>
<br>
“That’s not why he’s impressed Gris.” Grissom leaned back in his chair, giving a look to Warrick that was permission to go on. “She’s one of the top technical designers there is. You know like on James Bond? The guy that makes all those cool little toys? That’s her. Only for real.” Greg nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
“W-well,” Greg turned to Warrick, “except she works for a private company instead of for the government directly.” Warrick rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Same thing.”<br>
<br>
“Ah,” Grissom said, digesting the information. “She said something about testing an AR prototype, she said if it worked then there should be a picture of our killer on it.” Sara smiled and faced the others.<br>
<br>
“Except the prototype wasn’t going to work with our system.”<br>
<br>
“So her step brother donated the equipment necessary to use it,” Nick finished, guessing where Sara was going.<br>
<br>
“Yep,” Sara said, smiling at Nick.<br>
<br>
“He donated all of this equipment just so it would be compatible with a prototype that may or may not even work?” Greg asked in astonishment. Grissom frowned, thinking back to the strange vibe he got from Ford.<br>
<br>
“He seemed to be pretty protective of her,” Grissom answered. “Maybe he just wants to get this guy off the streets as much as we do.” Nick snorted.<br>
<br>
“Or maybe he just doesn’t want his top designer to be killed,” he said in a semi sarcastic tone. Grissom’s frown hadn’t faded. Sara shook her head a little.<br>
<br>
“That could be part of it, but I think he really cares for her. Do we know how long they’ve been step siblings?” Sara directed the question to Grissom, but Greg answered.<br>
<br>
“Seven years.” Everyone turned to look at him. “What? It’s public knowledge, and it was a big news item at the time.” Grissom’s mouth was hanging a little bit open, but he closed it and nodded.<br>
<br>
“That could certainly be long enough for them to have developed actual sibling feelings for each other, rather than just regarding the other as a step,” Sara theorized. Grissom looked down. He didn’t get the impression that Ford’s feelings were brotherly; he acted more like an obsessive boyfriend. He shook his head. Maybe he misread the situation. Wouldn’t he have been that concerned if one of his team had been in that position? He decided to change the topic, aware that he had been keeping his thoughts to himself long enough for everyone to be staring expectantly at him. He took off his glasses for a moment and rubbed his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Ms. Bouchard is going to be coming in with the prototype as soon as we call her to let her know that the new system is set up.” Greg and Warrick were suddenly more interested in the conversation.<br>
<br>
“Really?” Greg asked. “She’s coming here? She’s not just sending some lackey?” He started pacing around nervously in a little circle and mumbling to himself. “Oh man, this is so big. I can’t believe she’s actually coming to my lab.” Grissom cocked an eyebrow at him and got up from his seat.<br>
<br>
“Yes, she’s actually coming here. I got the impression that the prototype is kind of complicated.” He stepped closer to Greg, who was now near the door. “And when did it become your lab?” Greg looked up at him and gave a little grin. Grissom rolled his eyes. “We should get this stuff set up, call in some of Ecklie’s crew if you need help. I have the feeling she’s not going to want to stay cooped up in that hotel room for long.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
It took them a full three hours to remove the old equipment and install the new equipment, but they still hadn’t figured out how to install the new software or transfer any of the old files. They were all getting frustrated. What had seemed like a wonderful gift was turning into a big problem very quickly, as they still had other cases to work on. Grissom’s cell phone rang.<br>
<br>
“Grissom.” It was the front desk.<br>
<br>
“Sir, there’s a Clayton Bouchard here to see you.” Her voice became a little hushed, as if she was trying to make it so the man couldn’t hear her as well. “He looks pretty important, couple of bodyguards and the whole bit.” Grissom sighed. A headache was starting to build from the stress of the situation.<br>
<br>
“Tell him I’m on my way out to meet him.” The others turned to him at his statement and he clicked his phone off. “Mr. Bouchard is here so I’m going to speak with him.” He got to the door and then turned around and pointed at them. “Behave yourselves.” Sara and Nick smiled, despite the intense conditions they were working under. This gesture didn’t go unnoticed by Grissom. He had been watching their behavior toward each other turn from hostile at the very beginning to what now seemed to be a brother/sister relationship. He never considered the possibility it could be anything more than that, but now, thinking about how Ford Abernathy had been acting toward his actual stepsister, he wasn’t as sure. He frowned. Nick and Sara weren’t related at all. Not by blood or just marriage. It gave him a queasy feeling that he forced himself to shove down when he saw the man standing in the lobby.<br>
<br>
Clayton Bouchard. The quintessential billionaire. Tall, still in good shape for his age, good looking, and the aura of power that seemed to radiate from him. Grissom sighed. Bouchard was talking with Brass, and Brass noticed him first and waved him over.<br>
<br>
“Grissom, I’d like you meet Mr. Bouchard, Mr. Bouchard, this is Gil Grissom, our director of forensics.” They extended their arms to shake the other’s hand. “He’s Bunny Bouchard’s father.” Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
“Nice to meet you sir.” Grissom cringed inwardly at the respect this man commanded. He always tried to be respectful, it was a good way to hide what Catherine referred to as his ‘lack of social skills’, but he rarely called anyone sir or ma’m. He was used to putting himself in the authority position, especially with anyone involved with a case. Bouchard nodded and then frowned.<br>
<br>
“Are you feeling alright Mr. Grissom?” Grissom got a confused look on his face. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you, you just look kind of pale, like you’re going to be sick.” Grissom gave a half grin. Bouchard was observant. He should have expected that. People didn’t get to his position of wealth and power by letting things slip by them.<br>
<br>
“Trying to fight off an oncoming headache,” Grissom explained. Bouchard smiled and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Migraine? Ford gets those, has to sleep them off because none of the medicines work for him.” Grissom noticed how friendly and outgoing Bouchard was. He imagined that Bunny was also that way under normal circumstances, but then, he hadn’t seen her under normal circumstances. Grissom shook his head a little.<br>
<br>
“It’s not a migraine,” he paused, “not yet anyway.”<br>
<br>
“So, we can use my office to talk if you’d like,” Brass offered. Bouchard shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think that will be necessary. I just wanted to make sure that my daughter isn’t going to be in any sort of danger.” Grissom frowned.<br>
<br>
“I can’t guarantee that sir. I have no way of knowing whether the killer saw her as well,” Grissom said honestly. Bouchard’s concern crossed his features.<br>
<br>
“Would it be safer if I had her sent home?” Grissom considered Bouchard’s question, the wording more than the meaning behind it. Sent home. Maybe he had been overreacting to Ford’s concern for her. It seemed that everyone around her treated her like she was an object to be protected at all costs, except her bodyguard, interestingly enough, who seemed to be more concerned about her as a person.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know if she would go Mr. Bouchard,” Grissom paused, watching the man roll his eyes slightly. “She said something about a prototype that might be able to help us, she seemed pretty intent on being the one to set it up.” Bouchard sighed and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I figured. She’s stubborn and fearless,” he said, a tinge of pride ringing in his voice. Grissom grinned, and then he saw Ford, Bunny, Adrian, and a man he presumed was Ford’s bodyguard, come in through the doors. Bouchard followed Grissom’s eyes and smiled at the site. “Hey sweetheart,” he said, reaching out his arms for a hug from his daughter. She smiled and came over to give him a hug. Ford turned to Grissom.<br>
<br>
“You have the new system in place?” Grissom dropped his head.<br>
<br>
“We’re having trouble setting up the new software and transferring files,” he admitted. Ford smiled a big smile, revealing small dimples in his cheeks.<br>
<br>
“No problem. Lead the way and I’ll get it taken care of in a few minutes.” Grissom gave him a look. He had struck him as intelligent when he first met him, but more in a leadership and business capacity rather than in a technological sense. But, he had nothing to lose, and they were going to need every minute they could get. The killer was speeding up his schedule.<br>

It took him under ten minutes, which everyone was clearly impressed with, and at the same time they felt a little bad that they hadn’t been able to figure it out themselves.<br>
<br>
“How did you do that so fast? We were trying to get it hooked up for over an hour,” Sara said in an exasperated voice. Ford stood up and faced her, giving her a friendly, but not flirtatious, smile. Sara blushed a little before he even said anything. ‘Whoever said they couldn’t make a living with just a smile never met this guy,’ she silently thought.<br>
<br>
“It’s no big deal,” he said calmly, and then smiled again. “Of course, I work with these systems every day, so I’m used to it.” Grissom frowned, but Ford was still directing his attention toward Sara. He made a mental note to ask Greg if he knew any more about this guy. Handsome, smart, and charming could be a dangerous combination, especially with the added element of wealth. Ford turned to face Grissom. “Mr. Grissom.” Grissom was startled out of his train of thought.<br>
<br>
“Yes?” Ford grinned as he saw the expression on Grissom’s face and heard the tone in his voice. His blue eyes quickly flashed between Grissom and Sara and back again. Grissom was apparently the only one who noticed. ‘Oh great, he’s perceptive too.’<br>
<br>
“Could you tell Bunny to come in here now? It’s all ready.” Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
“So what does this prototype do exactly?” Warrick asked as Grissom left the room. Ford shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Got me. The AR prototype was originally started as an artificial retina design to help blind people see images by sending electric pulses and regenerating some nerves, but there’s no telling what it does now.” Ford chuckled. Nick furrowed his brows.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?” Ford crossed his arms and shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Bunny has a habit of getting sidetracked,” he explained without giving anything away.<br>
<br>
“Well, as long as it helps us catch this guy,” Sara said. Ford nodded.<br>
<br>
“I want to see him caught as much as you all do,” Ford said. “If for no other reason than the fact that he scared Bun. There’s barely anything that scares her. This guy must be a monster.” Grissom walked in with Bunny and Adrian. “Where’s your Dad?” Bunny grinned, obviously more at ease than earlier that day.<br>
<br>
“Work beckoned,” she stated in a non-chalant tone, indicating that it didn’t bother her. Grissom grinned to himself. ‘Of course it didn’t bother her, she doesn’t like being hovered over.’ “So we’re all set?” Ford nodded and walked over to her, putting his hand on the small of her back.<br>
<br>
“They were asking me what this little AR prototype of yours does,” Ford said, his mouth close enough to her that Grissom could see a few strands of her hair move when he spoke. She didn’t look at, or answer him, but remained focused on a small case she was taking out of her purse. “Bunny?” Her eyes darted up to him quickly, and then back down as she popped the lock on the case open.<br>
<br>
“Where is the 12 GP modulator?” She asked, looking around. Ford pointed to it and she moved away from him and over to it, but he followed close behind. Greg got a look at what was in the case.<br>
<br>
“Contacts?” He asked, surprised. She took the contacts out and placed them on a special grid inside the modulator, then closed the consul.<br>
<br>
“Not exactly,” she responded, sitting down at the computer. She typed a few things in to begin the program. “Did you send them a voice recognition program or do I need to do this the old fashioned way?” She directed the question to Ford, who was standing directly behind her. He gave a mock frown.<br>
<br>
“It’s in there. Lazy,” he kidded. She smiled.<br>
<br>
“So?” Bunny wasn’t upset by Ford’s accusation. She had gotten used to their banter as if it was completely normal. Grissom noticed Adrian standing by the door, looking out every once and again, and glaring at Ford any time he glanced at Bunny. He gave him a nod in recognition. “Ha! Here we go,” Bunny said excitedly. An image appeared up on a large viewing screen near the wall.<br>
<br>
“A digital movie?” Grissom asked in surprise. Bunny moved her head back and forth in a bouncy manner.<br>
<br>
“No, well, sort of. The prototype records the images that the person wearing it sees, and yes, kind of in a movie like format. No sounds though, and I need to enhance the zoom and low light capabilities.” Sara looked at her in shock.<br>
<br>
“That’s not possible,” she shook her head. Bunny grinned.<br>
<br>
“Of course it is,” she responded, not taking her eyes off the screen. “Computer recognition please.” The computer beeped. “Skip forward five minutes.” The image on screen leapt ahead to the killer running away and disappearing into the shadows. “Hmm. Too far. Skip backward three minutes.” The image went back to when she was first looking out the glass elevator. Bunny’s eyes were focused on the part of the screen she knew she would see the man in. Sara caught on to that and was looking there too. She gasped at what she saw next. The killer was finishing the removal of the head, and then he stood up with the saw and the head in his hands. “Freeze image. Zoom in on the bottom right hand corner, coordinates B-50.” Everyone in the room had their eyes glued to the screen in disbelief. “Digitally enhance and enlarge image.” In front of them was a clear picture of the man who had been so elusive. He never left any evidence at the scenes other than the body, and there had never been any witnesses until now. Adrian furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
“This image is from your point of view right?” Bunny nodded. Adrian quickly became concerned again and took his cell phone out.<br>
<br>
“Who are you calling?” She asked.<br>
<br>
“Your father. You need extra security and you need to get out of Las Vegas right away.” Bunny shot him a questioning and confused expression.<br>
<br>
“Why?” Adrian pointed at the screen, to the man’s face.<br>
<br>
“He’s looking directly at you.” Grissom cringed and Sara’s mouth dropped open. Sara nodded.<br>
<br>
“He’s right.”<br>
<br>
“So?” Bunny asked, apparently not seeing why this was a big deal. Grissom sighed before answering.<br>
<br>
“You fit the victim profile. Blonde, in good shape physically.” Ford’s eyes grew large and panicked.<br>
<br>
“What?!” He questioned, half panicked, half angered. Nick and Warrick exchanged ‘oh, crap’ looks at each other. Adrian was talking to Bouchard on the phone throughout the conversation, but he caught the part before Ford flipped out. He came over to Bunny and grabbed her arm forcefully, but not cruelly, and started to lead her to the door.<br>
<br>
“We need to get you out of here now. Additional security will be waiting at the hotel to help escort you to your Dad’s plane at the airport.” Bunny pulled her arm away from him.<br>
<br>
“Geez, will you calm down? It’s not like it’s a big deal. He doesn’t know who I am, and there are a few thousand women here who fit that profile.” Both Ford and Adrian gave her warning looks, which she ignored. “Besides, they have a picture of him now. They can run it through a facial recognition database and see if they get a match, and in the meantime they can send the police out with the picture in hand.” Sara was impressed by Bunny’s bravery, or foolishness, she hadn’t quite figured out which it was yet. She theorized that this was more like Bunny’s day to day personality, strong and stubborn, but lighthearted. She didn’t want her to get hurt though, and even with a bodyguard as frightening as Adrian, she could still be taken by the killer. Ford, still standing next to Bunny wrapped his arm around her waist. In an almost whispered voice, he spoke to her.<br>
<br>
“Have you taken into consideration that this could very well be the man who was stalking you a year ago? We never did find out who it was or what he looked like.” Bunny rolled her eyes. Nick was the only one close enough to catch the comment and he closed his eyes, pushing down his emotions about his own brush with a stalker.<br>
<br>
“How long were you stalked?” Nick asked in a concerned tone. She looked over at him, her expression unreadable. She sighed.<br>
<br>
“Only a couple of months. It wasn’t as bad as a lot of people get. He just sent flowers and notes of his undying affection every day. More like a secret admirer,” she said, although there was a quality to her voice that suggested that it wasn’t like that all. Adrian and Ford both scoffed.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, a secret admirer who writes notes with blood is called a stalker Bunny.” Ford said. Sara’s eyes widened in disgust and horror, but also in query.<br>
<br>
“Did you ever have the blood analyzed?” Sara asked. Maybe it wasn’t an appropriate question given the circumstances, but she wouldn’t know unless she asked. Grissom grinned at her, as he had been ready to ask the same question until she interjected. Ford nodded, now rubbing his hand up and down Bunny’s upper arm.<br>
<br>
“Every single note. They all were from different people, all female if I remember correctly. The police suggested that he might be a worker at a bloodbank or hospital or something, somewhere he could have ready access to a supply of blood.” Grissom nodded. That sounded reasonable, but there was still something nagging at the back of his head.<br>
<br>
“Do you still have the results?” He asked. Ford was taken aback by the question and looked surprised.<br>
<br>
“I have no idea. Why?” Grissom looked down, trying to figure out a way to phrase the answer delicately.<br>
<br>
“If they were all female samples, and although this is a big leap, if it is the same man who was stalking her…” Ford’s face paled, receiving Grissom’s unspoken implication.<br>
<br>
“Then he could have been killed those women too,” he said in a hushed and disbelieving voice. “Oh, God.” Bunny arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“That’s quite a leap isn’t it? I mean, people are stalked every day and it’s not all by the same person.” Her question, although the wording of it suggested that she thought Grissom’s theory was crap, was in the tone of someone who recognized that it could be a possibility and didn’t want to believe it. Ford ignored her statement and turned to Adrian.<br>
<br>
“Have the extra security meet us over here instead, and I’m going to call her Dad’s office and see if they still have the results on file.” He turned to Grissom. “Do you have access to the federal DNA databank?” Grissom’s eyes grew large and he cocked an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“They’re keeping DNA on file?” Ford gave a half grin and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Makes it easier to compare results to previous convictions and such I imagine. Do you want me to have them run the note results through that first?” Grissom nodded and Ford followed suit. “Give me your office fax number and I’ll have them send the results over as soon as they’re done running them.” He turned to Bunny and spoke to her in a very authoritative tone. “You. You don’t leave without Adrian and the other security that’s coming. You don’t go to a different room in this building unless you have other people with you. You don’t ditch them. Understand?” Bunny gave a mischievous grin. “I mean it.” She rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Fine Bubba, I understand.” He pulled her into a hug and kissed her forehead, then left the room. “Stupid Vegas, didn’t even want to come here in the first place,” she mumbled. Nick walked over to her.<br>
<br>
“We can go to the break room if you’d like,” he drawled. “You’ll probably be more comfortable there, and I know there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done on other cases.” He looked at Grissom for unspoken permission and he nodded. “Come on, I’ll show you the way.” Adrian walked with them while he finished his phone call.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Bunny sat down in one of the break room chairs, stretching her feet out so they were lying on top of a parallel one.<br>
<br>
“Make yourself comfortable,” Adrian joked. Bunny smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. Nick sat down across from her, opening a Coke.<br>
<br>
“You want one?” Bunny arched an eyebrow and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“Eeww, no. You know how bad that is for you?” Nick smiled.<br>
<br>
“Health nut huh?” She shot him a glare, but it wasn’t malicious.<br>
<br>
“Not really, but drinking out of aluminum cans contributes to heavy metals toxicity, and I don’t really care to have Alzheimer’s when I get older,” Bunny retorted. Nick’s mouth was slightly agape. Adrian snorted.<br>
<br>
“And I’m sure working in a lab with those sorts of materials doesn’t do anything to you right?” She grinned.<br>
<br>
“Well, I’m not swallowing them there.” There was a little chuckle that filled the room, and then a silent pause. Nick looked thoughtful.<br>
<br>
“So is your brother always like that?” Adrian eyed him. He knew what he was talking about, but to bring up the subject with Bunny was a bit dangerous.<br>
<br>
“Is he always like what?” Bunny asked somewhat innocently. “Like an overprotective jackass? Yes.” Nick snorted and some of the pop that was in his mouth flew out. He quickly grabbed a couple of paper towels to clean up the mess.<br>
<br>
“Uh, well, that too.” He paused. He knew one of the main reasons he had been hired was because of his interpersonal skills, but some subjects were delicate, especially if the person you were speaking with didn’t know what you were talking about. “He just seems awfully fond of you is all.” Adrian winced a little, and then turned to look out in the hallway again so Bunny wouldn’t be able to see the look on his face. Bunny gave Nick a confused look and shrugged.<br>
<br>
“We’re pretty good friends for being step siblings if that’s what you mean.” Nick gave a half grin. Maybe it would be better if he didn’t continue right now; she probably had a lot of other things on her mind. And another was about to come.<br>
<br>
Warrick ran into the break room and almost got knocked over by Adrian, who was blocking the entryway. He looked at Nick.<br>
<br>
“There’s been another one,” he said, distressed at the situation, but still trying to maintain his cool exterior. “Grissom said for you and I to take this one.” Nick got up from his chair and threw his Coke can into the recycling bin. He turned around to face Bunny.<br>
<br>
“Are you going to be okay here?” Bunny snorted.<br>
<br>
“I’m in a police building with my bodyguard. I’m fairly certain I’ll survive,” she said sarcastically and waved him away. Adrian chuckled. Nick nodded and he and Warrick left to go to the latest ‘headless horseman’ crime scene.<br>

Brass gave Nick and Warrick a weary look as they approached. Warrick motioned toward the press with his head.<br>
<br>
“They haven’t been cleared out yet?” Brass sighed.<br>
<br>
“No, and thanks to our beloved Sheriff, they’re going to be staying a little while longer. He decided to issue a statement, but he hasn’t showed up yet.” Warrick shook his head and put his gloves on.<br>
<br>
“Doesn’t he know that serial killers get off on the attention?” Brass rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“So does he.” Nick snorted and then pointed to the woman’s body.<br>
<br>
“Any I.D. on her?” Brass nodded.<br>
<br>
“Yeah. This guy’s definitely not in it for the money. She had over two grand in her purse that she won in the casino.” Nick whistled as he snapped his gloves on. Brass looked at his notepad. “Jaimie Uller, visiting from South Dakota. We talked to the guy at the door and he said the woman on the I.D. was wearing those clothes.” Nick nodded, walking over to the woman, ignoring the questions the members of the press were calling out. Warrick furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
“Guy at the door? He didn’t see the murder though?” Brass frowned.<br>
<br>
“Not in his direct line of vision for greeting people. And, before you ask, I had the security cameras checked out too, all snow for the outside cameras on that side.”<br>
<br>
“And no other witnesses?” Nick asked as he fingerprinted the lifeless hands.<br>
<br>
“As usual,” Brass quipped.<br>
<br>
“How does this guy keep getting away with this in such crowded areas? I could understand if he was killing them out in the middle of nowhere, but look around.” The three briefly took in the area with their eyes. “Even without the press here, there are at least a thousand people on this street.” Warrick nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
“At least we have a picture of him now.” Brass raised an eyebrow in surprise.<br>
<br>
“Since when?” Nick stood up and grinned at Brass, while Warrick looked for any other evidence at the scene.<br>
<br>
“Your last witness, Bunny Bouchard, is a big technology designer. She got a pic of the guy off her contact lens.”<br>
<br>
“Got it with you?” Warrick nodded his head from his crouching position.<br>
<br>
“In the car.” Brass smiled.<br>
<br>
“Keys?” Nick tossed the keys at Brass. “Just in time for Mobley’s speech,” he motioned toward the Sheriff, who was just arriving.<br>
<br>
Warrick, paying attention to Brass only as background noise, narrowed his eyes at something on the body. He lifted her tank top just enough to see a card that had been shoved under it.<br>
<br>
“Nick!” Nick came over and Warrick held up the small card, the kind that usually comes with flowers. It was sealed. On the front, it had a stamp of a rabbit on it.<br>
<br>
“@#%$,” Nick mumbled. “Ever wish Grissom was sometimes wrong about these things?” Warrick frowned as he placed the card into an evidence bag.<br>
<br>
“Yeah.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Adrian stood in the doorway of the break room staring at Bunny, who was just sitting there flipping through the TV channels with the remote. She turned it off.<br>
<br>
“This is so-oo boring,” she whined, flopping her face on top of her crossed arms on the table. He flashed her a smile when she looked up at him. “You think is funny don’t you?” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
“I just find it interesting that you’re stuck here because you wouldn’t listen to me about not going running in the foothills.” She rolled her eyes and rested a check against her palm.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, instead I could have been stuck in my hotel room. Big difference,” she said sarcastically. She didn’t like being told what to do or being caged, both of which were getting on her nerves and making her snippy. Adrian arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Well, there’s more you can do in your hotel room,” he said semi- suggestively. He would never cross that line unless she was the one to initiate, but a little flirting might help cheer her up. She laughed.<br>
<br>
“Yeah right,” she said, not getting the hint that he was talking about himself. “When’s the last time I actually had a date? Dad tried to set me up with that son of I don’t even remember who a little over a year ago, but Ford nixed that before I could even meet the guy.” Adrian frowned. Her social life wasn’t like that of typical women of her station. She was beautiful, and could certainly get any guy she set her mind to getting, but her Dad or Ford usually got in the way, saying they wouldn’t be good enough for her. And, rather than get into a big fight, she would usually give in. Most men, from Adrian’s vantage point, didn’t seem to be smart or good looking enough, or a combination of the two, to even warrant a second look from her, and he figured that was why she didn’t fight with them about it like she did for everything else.<br>
<br>
“Have you talked to Ford about that?” He asked, taking a step closer to her. Bunny shrugged, and then stood up to stretch.<br>
<br>
“It’s not that big of a deal. I’m sure if I actually find a guy that I’m interested in then he’ll back off.” Adrian frowned. “What?”<br>
<br>
“Don’t count on it.” Bunny furrowed her brow at him.<br>
<br>
“Why not?” Adrian sighed, trying to think of a tactful way to say what needed to be said.<br>
<br>
“Well, Ford is…” Ford walked into the doorway.<br>
<br>
“Ford is what?” He asked cocking an eyebrow. Adrian turned his head around.<br>
<br>
“Extra security here?” Adrian asked, bypassing Ford’s question. Ford nodded.<br>
<br>
“They’re here,” he said, then turning his attention to Bunny. “But you’re not going to like it.” She scowled at him.<br>
<br>
“I already don’t like it.” Ford smiled and walked over to her.<br>
<br>
“Well, then you’re not going to like it even more. It seems that the local sheriff just held a press conference.” Bunny frowned. “Exactly,” Ford said, as if reading her thoughts. “Which means that your Dad has about five extra guys out there.”<br>
<br>
“Crap. When did you find this out? Nobody told us and we’ve been here the whole time.” Ford placed a reassuring hand on her back.<br>
<br>
“It was on TV, they just had a press conference. You could probably catch a recap if you want to turn it on,” he said, pointing at the TV. Bunny sighed and leaned her head against Ford’s chest. He wrapped his arms around her and kissed the top of her head. “Don’t worry, it’s going to be okay.” Adrian winced at Ford’s affection toward Bunny. She obviously only viewed it as brotherly love, and just as obvious was how Ford seemed to take advantage of that fact. She pulled away from him.<br>
<br>
“So what’s going to happen now?” Ford shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Adrian will have to coordinate with them, and then we’ll leave Las Vegas and go somewhere safe.” Ford gave her a half grin. Bunny sighed.<br>
<br>
“This is completely unnecessary.”<br>
<br>
“Better to be safe than sorry.”<br>
<br>
“I guess.” Bunny nodded and walked over to Adrian, who was now standing in the doorway again, looking out into the hallway.<br>
<br>
“I don’t suppose I could give you a bribe to just let me accidentally get away?” She asked with a smile in a somewhat lowered voice, already knowing what the answer would be. Adrian chuckled.<br>
<br>
“No.” She let her smile drop momentarily, but quickly returned it.<br>
<br>
“Are you sure? I could make it worth your while,” she said half jokingly, rubbing her thumb against her finger. Adrian and Ford both laughed.<br>
<br>
“Do you really think your Dad would have hired him as your bodyguard if he thought for a second that you would be able to bribe him?” Ford asked.<br>
<br>
“And do you really think that I would actually just let you go when there’s a serial killer on the loose who’s seen your face, and who’s victim profile you match?” Adrian added. Bunny sighed and went back over to stand next to Ford.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Nick and Warrick came back to the lab to drop off the evidence for processing, and to tell Grissom about what they found at the scene. They had seen the five men, that they presumed were there for Bunny’s extra security, in the lobby. Nick shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I kind of feel sorry for her,” he said. Warrick raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, poor little rich girl syndrome. That’s gotta suck,” he replied, deadpan. “Her Dad must have seen the press conference. I doubt there’d be so many guys here otherwise.” Nick frowned.<br>
<br>
“Don’t be so sure.” They reached the lab door. “Hey guys, guess what we found.” Nick held up the evidence bag. Grissom furrowed his brow, as if trying to see the card from his location across the room. Sara, however, approached them quickly, and swiftly snapped the bag away from Nick’s fingers. “Since when is this your case?” Nick asked in a mock defensive tone. Sara smiled.<br>
<br>
“Since I said so.” Grissom frowned as he watched Sara banter back and forth with Nick. She held the bag open as she reached in with her glove- covered hands. “A card?” Nick smiled and turned it over so she could see the rabbit stamp on the other side. “Oh crap.” She looked up, searching the room for Grissom, who had moved closer to her as if feeling his territory was threatened. He saw the concern and panic in her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Sara?” The question went unanswered as an unseen knockout gas filtered through the ventilation system. Sara, because of her weight, was the first one to drop. Greg was next, and the others followed quickly. The guards in the security monitor room didn’t have a chance to see all of their screens go to static.<br>
<br>
A tall man wearing a gas mask came into the building, looking at the people lying on the floor. The stomping sound from his combat boots reverberated through the halls, but no one was awake to hear it. He headed down the corridor, already knowing his destination. He stopped at the break room door and a grin crossed his lips when he saw Bunny lying unconscious. The grin quickly turned to a frown when he saw Ford next to her. He walked over to where Ford lay, the anger seething through his motions.<br>
<br>
“She and I belong together!” He yelled at the unconscious man. “How dare you try to keep her away from me!” He pulled his foot back and kicked Ford hard in the head. Blood came immediately, but the man wasn’t satisfied, and he kicked him again. He took a step back and breathed in a deep breath. “I would kill you now if I thought she wouldn’t be angry with me for it.” He looked back over at Bunny and bent down, scooping her up in his arms. He nuzzled his mouth up to her ear and whispered, “It’s okay sweetheart, nobody can keep us apart now.”<br>

<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Sara woke up slowly, dizzy and disoriented. Her vision was a little blurry, and when she tried to lift herself up, it felt like the room was spinning. Once she recognized her surroundings, she forced herself to work past the ill effects to see if her friends were alright. The first person she saw was Nick, who seemed to be waking up as well. She crawled over to him and lightly shook him.<br>
<br>
“Nick, wake up.” He blinked his eyes a few times, trying to focus on her. He narrowed his eyes in temporary confusion.<br>
<br>
“Sara?” She nodded. He started to rise, leaning an elbow on the floor to prop himself up. He looked around the room. “What happened?” She shook her head, immediately regretting the action, and buried her head between her knees to fight the nausea. He grimaced, knowing exactly what she was going through, and put a comforting hand on her back.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” she answered, slowly raising her head. “The last thing I remember is talking to Grissom about…” her eyes widened and she frantically looked around for the evidence bag, fearing that it had been taken. She calmed a little when she saw that it hadn’t. Nick nodded, not needing her to complete her sentence.<br>
<br>
“Must have put something in the ventilation system,” Nick concluded, motioning with his head to where the duct was. Sara closed her eyes in thought for a moment.<br>
<br>
“Nick, you don’t think this had anything to do with Bunny do you?” He frowned.<br>
<br>
“Maybe, but security probably got her out of here in time.”<br>
<br>
“Probably?” Her concern furrowed her brow. “We should try to wake up the others.” An officer came stumbling in through the lab door, clutching the wall with his hands to help support him.<br>
<br>
“You alright in here?” He looked at the others lying on the floor. “Don’t worry, everybody’s waking up, just slowly.” Nick nodded, standing up on weak legs.<br>
<br>
“How many rooms have you checked?”<br>
<br>
“Just a few myself, got two other guys on it too though,” the officer offered a small smile. “You want to help or stay here until they wake up?” Nick looked at Sara; her expression was still a little grim.<br>
<br>
“I’ll stay, you should go Nick,” she said, finally standing up, grasping onto the counter for support. He smiled and grabbed her arm lightly to help her.<br>
<br>
“You sure?” She smiled back.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, check the break room first to make sure Bunny made it out okay will you?” He nodded, letting go of her arm.<br>
<br>
“Will do.” Nick and the officer left the lab, and Sara tried to think of a way to wake the others. She was trying to figure out why she had this gnawing feeling in her gut that didn’t have anything to do with the side effects of the knockout gas. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something bad had happened to Bunny, and although it clearly wasn’t her fault, she still felt responsible. Maybe if she had been more insistent that they get her out of Las Vegas sooner, she shook her head. It wouldn’t have done any good, Bunny was as stubborn as she was, and she certainly saw that aspect of her personality. She noticed that Warrick was starting to wake up, and gently crouched down beside him.<br>
<br>
“Hey.” He looked at her and then around the room, as his vision was focusing.<br>
<br>
“Hey.”<br>
<br>
“Nick thinks it was some sort of gas pumped through the vents.” Warrick nodded gently and then rubbed his head.<br>
<br>
“Nice side effects,” he said sarcastically. Sara smiled.<br>
<br>
“It gets better.” She held out her hand to help him up.<br>
<br>
Nick soon appeared in the doorway, with Adrian following him. Sara and Warrick were helping Grissom to a chair. The chemicals in the gas had affected him more than the others, and Sara silently wondered if he should stay at work or go home, though she knew better than to bring up the topic with everything going on. No point in starting a fight when she knew what the outcome would be. Sara looked over at Nick and saw the grim expression on his face.<br>
<br>
“What happened?” He ran his hands through his hair and spoke with a light shake in his voice.<br>
<br>
“I already called an ambulance, it should be here in a couple minutes,” he replied, not really answering Sara’s question. She stepped closer to him, her eyes wider.<br>
<br>
“What happened Nick?” Sara tried her best to keep her voice calm, but it wasn’t easy. Even though they had a picture of the killer now, just working on serial murder cases in addition to their regular workload had put everyone through the ringer. Adrian decided to answer for him when he saw that Nick was just standing there at a loss for words.<br>
<br>
“Bunny’s gone, Ford’s hurt, ambulance is on its way,” he said, getting right to the point. Nick sighed.<br>
<br>
“They’re checking on the security camera tapes right now to see what happened, but if the same guy is responsible…”<br>
<br>
“Then there won’t be anything there,” Grissom finished Nick’s statement for him. Nick nodded. “He certainly seems to be making this personal doesn’t he?” Grissom observed. Sara frowned.<br>
<br>
“Stalkers usually do,” she mumbled in a low voice. Grissom looked up at her thoughtfully, but she quickly covered by motioning to Nick. “Remember when Nick was stalked? That guy made up a whole imaginary friendship in his mind.” Nick winced.<br>
<br>
“She’s right.” Grissom took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes, then put his glasses back on. He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I get the feeling it’s more than that.” He looked over to Adrian. “Is there any chance that she knew this guy, even if it was just in passing, and just somehow forgot?” Adrian was about to answer when the paramedics came down the hall.<br>
<br>
“I’ll be right back,” he said, indicating one minute with his finger. Sara leaned against the counter and turned her attention back to Grissom.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know, you really think someone as smart as she is would forget knowing someone?”<br>
<br>
“Especially someone who kills people?” Nick added. Grissom shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Anything’s possible children.” Warrick gave a half grin at Grissom’s statement. “She’s smart, but a good memory for some things might not translate to other areas of her life, like for instance, social skills.” He paused, recognizing that statement held true for himself as well, and possibly for Sara. “Let’s go over the scenarios.”<br>
<br>
“Scenario one. Something similar to Nick’s experience. She just briefly met the guy and then he started stalking her,” Warrick said.<br>
<br>
“And Ford put a stop to it, or so he thought, and that’s why he was attacked,” Sara added. Nick shook his head.<br>
<br>
“No. That can’t be it,” Nick said. “Unless he met her before Adrian started working as her bodyguard, then started stalking her a year later.” Sara frowned. Nick was right. The time frame didn’t work, because Adrian would have definitely said something if he had recognized him, even in passing.<br>
<br>
“Okay, scenario two. Maybe he worked for one of her dad’s subsidiary companies. He could have seen her, maybe even met her, and she probably wouldn’t remember him. And Ford wouldn’t necessarily remember him because he doesn’t deal with all the personnel on a daily basis.” She looked at Nick. “And, maybe Adrian wasn’t there, because he’s not with her all the time when she’s at work, just when she leaves the building.” Grissom gave a half grin. Sara frowned and confusion passed over Grissom’s features.<br>
<br>
“Sara?”<br>
<br>
“I was just thinking that couldn’t be completely right either,” she said, starting to pace. “I mean, if that was the case, then why beat up Ford?”<br>
<br>
“No, it still holds Sara. If he knew Ford was the one behind getting him to stop stalking her,” Warrick said. Nick ran a hand over his face, and then crossed his arms, giving a somewhat disgusted look.<br>
<br>
“Or because of something else,” he murmured. Warrick gave him a questioning look and Nick shrugged. “Well, Ford seems to be kind of, um,” he searched for the right word, “attached, to Bunny.” He paused. “Maybe if he met her in passing at one of the company functions or something, Ford was probably there too, and…”<br>
<br>
“And he probably thought that they were involved,” Grissom nodded. “Meaning that the attack may have been motivated by jealousy rather than hatred for him keeping him away from her.” Nick nodded.<br>
<br>
“Yeah.” Sara frowned, furrowing her brow ever so slightly.<br>
<br>
“Why would he think that they were involved?” She had taken his affection for Bunny as concern and protectiveness rather than non-platonic feelings. Grissom cocked an eyebrow at her. “What? Just because he’s been kind of protective toward her these last couple days doesn’t mean that he’s always like that, he has good reason to try and be comforting toward her right now.” Nick rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“You’re just saying that because you like him,” he teased. Grissom frowned and shot Nick a warning look. He held up his hands in mock surrender. “Just kidding.”<br>
<br>
“Well,” Sara said thoughtfully, “if he is like that all the time, that would certainly explain the killer’s animosity toward him.” The paramedics went back through the hall carrying Ford, who hadn’t woken up yet, on a stretcher. Adrian came back into the lab. Sara gave him a questioning look with her eyes.<br>
<br>
“It doesn’t look good right now,” he said in an almost sorrowful tone. He and Ford hadn’t always gotten along, primarily because he knew how Ford felt about Bunny, but he still considered him a friend. “Do you need me here?” Grissom shook his head.<br>
<br>
“No. Have you called Mr. Bouchard yet?” Adrian sighed and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, that wasn’t a fun conversation.” Grissom leaned forward in his seat.<br>
<br>
“This wasn’t your fault. There wasn’t anything you could have done to prevent it. If you want me to talk to him I will.” Adrian shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I should have gotten her out of here sooner. I shouldn’t have waited for additional security.” He paused. “You don’t need to talk to him, he didn’t fire me or anything. Finding Bunny and bringing her back safe is his top priority right now. It should be your top priority too.” He looked at Grissom and Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
“It is.”<br>
<br>
“Good. You can probably expect him to call in some of his contacts from the federal government to look for her.” Grissom sighed.<br>
<br>
“I figured.” Adrian nodded and scribbled something on a piece of paper.<br>
<br>
“Here’s my cell phone number to keep in contact. I’m going to meet Mr. Bouchard at the hospital right now.” He handed the slip of paper to Grissom and turned to leave the lab. He swung back around. “Please keep me posted if you find out anything, even if it’s small.” Grissom took the piece of paper and nodded.<br>
<br>
“No problem.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Bunny began to regain consciousness slowly. Her head was spinning and she felt like she needed to throw up. As she opened her eyes, and got past the spinning room obstacle, she realized that she didn’t know where she was. She felt too sick to panic though, and instead, rolled over onto her stomach on the bed she was on. ‘Okay, bed. Definitely not in the police building anymore. Hotel?’ She opened her eyes again and looked around the room, whatever she could look at without having to move too much. It didn’t look like her room. It was small, modestly decorated, and had a vase of roses and a tablet of paper on the nightstand. She let out a small groan and then reached for the tablet. It had writing scrawled on it, but her vision was still blurry, and after a severe wave of dizziness engulfed her, she let the tablet drop to the ground and closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
A few hours later, she woke up again, not feeling the side effects of the gas nearly as bad this time. She pushed herself off the bed and gazed at the roses. ‘Humph. Probably a bad effort on Ford’s part to try and make me not feel so bad about being moved to a safe house.’ She remembered the pad of paper and glanced down at the floor. She bent down and picked it up, but didn’t immediately recognize the handwriting.<br>
<br>
My Dearest Bunny,<br>
<br>
Don’t fear, I have not left you. I’m just making arrangements for our departure. I’ll be back soon. They won’t ever be able to keep us apart again.<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
<br>
William<br>
<br>
She cocked an eyebrow. ‘Who the hell is William?’ She shrugged off the foreboding feeling that was building in her gut. ‘Well, I’m not sticking around to find out.’ She made her way to the door, but just as she was reaching for the knob, it opened.<br>
<br>
Bunny recognized the man in the doorway as the man from the picture of the killer. He was good looking, but had the aura of danger and wickedness that surrounded him. She stepped away from him. He gave her a big smile that appeared to be genuine.<br>
<br>
“Sweetheart! I’m so glad you’re up. I was starting to worry.” He quickly closed the gap between them and swept her up into a hug. He pulled away slightly, but still had one arm around her, the other hand sweeping up into her hair. “How are you feeling?” She carefully took in the man’s appearance. He was clean, well groomed, but didn’t seem familiar to her other than from the incident. She furrowed her brow.<br>
<br>
“Do I know you?” ‘Okay, probably not the right thing to ask a serial killer Bunny,’ she berated herself. He grinned and brought her into another tight embrace.<br>
<br>
“I know, it’s been far too long since we’ve seen each other hasn’t it?” She could feel his breath on her ear. He pulled back again. “Don’t worry, I’m going to make up for lost time. We’re together now, and we’ll always be together from now on.”<br>

Greg frowned and shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Nada. They were way too smeared to come up with anything.” Grissom nodded and walked over to Sara, who was going through a facial recognition program.<br>
<br>
“Anything?” He asked, leaning onto the counter with one arm. She grinned, but Grissom could tell it that it was compensatory.<br>
<br>
“Nothing yet. Ran it through the state and federal prison databases, military, just started federal employees,” she rambled off. He raised an eyebrow and moved a little closer to her.<br>
<br>
“It goes pretty fast doesn’t it?” She eyed him and grinned, but didn’t respond. The computer monitor made a ding sound and froze the image in front of her. “William Feagans,” Grissom read off.<br>
<br>
“CIA, leave of absence, personnel records sealed,” Sara skimmed through the rest out loud. “When would Bunny have met a CIA agent?” Warrick looked up and came closer.<br>
<br>
“You found something?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah. William Feagins. He’s CIA.” Warrick nodded, looking at the screen.<br>
<br>
“That makes sense. She designs some of their cool little toys right?” Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
“I’ll call Adrian. Sara…” Sara was already out of her chair by the time he turned back around.<br>
<br>
“Get Brass to issue an APB, I got it,” she completed his sentence, moving past him into the hallway. He nodded once and turned to Warrick. “Warrick, you and Nick…” Warrick grinned.<br>
<br>
“Start calling local hotels and see if he’s registered. On it Gris.” Grissom stood there dumbstruck, but proud. His team was a well oiled machine. He went to his office and sat down. Grissom took the slip of paper with Adrian’s number on it out of his pocket and slightly winced before dialing. He had no doubt that Mr. Bouchard would call in any favors he needed to get his daughter back safely, but it might be a moot point if Feagins had already killed her. He shook the thought away. Certainly she was smart enough to pretend to be nice to him until help could arrive.<br>
<br>
“Hello?” Adrian’s deep voice answered.<br>
<br>
“It’s Grissom from the crime lab,” Grissom didn’t pause for recognition. “The facial recognition program came up with a match.”<br>
<br>
“Who?” He asked, the question’s tone sounding not just protective, but menacing.<br>
<br>
“William Feagins. He’s a CIA agent on leave of absence. It wouldn’t give us any more information than that without clearance.”<br>
<br>
“Thanks.”<br>
<br>
“Adrian,” Grissom said, trying to keep the man from hanging up on him. “My team is on it. We’ve put out an APB for him, we’re calling hotels. We’re going to get him.” He knew that Adrian had other ideas, but he had to at least try to get the man to be rational and let the authorities handle it. He heard him sigh.<br>
<br>
“Mr. Grissom, I appreciate your concern, and your help, but I’m going to do everything I can to bring her back.” Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
“I figured.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Bunny sat on a chair, opposite the window, in the room. Feagins sat across from her and leaned forward.<br>
<br>
“You’ve been quiet. Penny for your thoughts.” She looked up at him, trying to hide the fear and apprehension in her eyes. She shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Just a lot of stuff I guess.” She paused and looked away from him. “Can you tell me why?” She asked in a quiet voice. He reached across and took her hands in his. She looked back at him.<br>
<br>
“Why I killed them or why I had to take you?” He asked in a sincere and gentle tone.<br>
<br>
“Both.” He grinned, still holding her hands.<br>
<br>
“They weren’t you. Your brother was trying to trick me, but I knew they weren’t you. I had to get rid of them.” Bunny held the expression on her face still, absorbing the explanation. “As for the second part, I knew that if I didn’t take you away from them that we could never be together. Ford is a bad person Bunny, he couldn’t accept that we belong together. But, it’s all taken care of now.” He lifted a hand and swept a stray strand of hair behind her ear. She furrowed her brow.<br>
<br>
“You didn’t do anything to Ford did you?” She asked, clearly concerned. He frowned at her and got out of his seat.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t kill him if that’s what you mean.”<br>
<br>
“What did you do?” She asked, a little more anger to her voice, she raised from her chair as well. If she was going to die, she may as well go down fighting. Feagins spun around, surprised by Bunny’s outburst. Anger reflected in his eyes, but he quickly pushed the emotion down and stepped close to her, placing a hand on her waist. He leaned down and spoke directly into her ear.<br>
<br>
“He’ll live. But if you continue to take his side over mine, I can’t guarantee for how long.” Bunny shuddered involuntarily. Risking her own life was one thing, after all, she reasoned, this guy was probably going to kill her anyway. But risking Ford’s life was quite another. Feagins noticed her response and nodded once. “We’ve come to an understanding then?” He asked, though it came out as more of a statement than a question. Bunny closed her eyes, fighting down her rapid pulse and urge to scream at the top of her lungs. She opened them again, seeing Feagins’s hazel eyes staring into her own. She nodded.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“Grissom,” he answered the phone in his office, cradling it between his ear and shoulder as he sorted through paperwork on his desk.<br>
<br>
“Hey, it’s Adrian. Bouchard had some people go through Feagins’s apartment.” Grissom frowned.<br>
<br>
“That doesn’t sound entirely legal,” Grissom responded in a half sarcastic tone. He could have sworn he heard Adrian snicker on the other end.<br>
<br>
“You’d be surprised how quickly you can get a warrant when every person in government owes you,” he replied. Grissom pursed his lips and went back to the original topic.<br>
<br>
“What did they find?”<br>
<br>
“Well, he was definitely stalking her.”<br>
<br>
“We already figured that.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but the guys who went through the apartment said it looked like he may have been hired,” Adrian added. Grissom furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
“Hired to stalk her?” Adrian shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Don’t know about that, but hired to take pictures of her. There are records indicating that he did some freelance PI work in his off time, and all of the pics decorating his walls correspond to dates and negatives in a certain file.” Grissom ran his hand through his hair.<br>
<br>
“So why stalk her then? Why start killing innocent women?” Grissom thought aloud.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” Adrian admitted. “I think he’s probably the only one who can tell you that.” Grissom sighed.<br>
<br>
“And maybe not even him.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah. Listen, he only used the client’s initials on the file, no full or partial name on anything.”<br>
<br>
“What were the initials?”<br>
<br>
“B.A.” Grissom scribbled the initials down on a scratch piece of paper. “They’re trying to connect the initials to any of his known friends or associates. Anything new over there?” Grissom rubbed his temple with his free hand.<br>
<br>
“We have people going door to door at every hotel and motel in the area. No one registered under his name though when we made the calls.” Adrian nodded, he had expected as much.<br>
<br>
“Let me know if you find out anything else.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah.” Grissom hung up the phone without a good-bye, as in his line of work it wasn’t customary. This latest development was beginning to gnaw at his gut instincts. He didn’t understand why, at least not yet.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Bunny had a glass of water about an hour ago, and had quickly passed out due to the drug that Feagins had slipped in it. She woke up with her right arm handcuffed to the headboard of the bed, and her senses dulled. She couldn’t tell whether she was just having a bad dream or it was real. Her vision was almost completely blurred and her sense of touch was practically numb. As the drug started to wear off, she felt someone on top of her, inside her. She panicked and started to flail around, kicking her legs, and trying to buck him off. Feagins, at almost twice her size, and quite a bit of it muscle, was able to keep her moderately controlled though, and soon finished. As he lay down on her, only propped up by one arm, he stared directly into her eyes.<br>
<br>
“You’re mine now.” He leaned in and whispered into her ear in a threatening tone. “Don’t forget it.” He rolls off the bed and goes to take a shower, knowing that she won’t be able to go anywhere. Bunny, still tired from the effects of the drug, but gaining more coherence by the moment, covered herself loosely with a sheet on the bed. She quickly scanned the room for a phone. There was one on the nightstand on her left side. She wouldn’t be able to reach it with her arm, and hadn’t discounted the possibility that Feagins had unplugged it.<br>
<br>
She maneuvered her body so her legs were facing that side of the bed, but it put quite a strain on her arm, and she winced when the handcuff cut into her small wrist. She was able to knock the receiver off the hook and heard the dial tone. ‘Thank you God.’ It was too far away for her to pick up the phone or the receiver, but she was barely able to hit the ‘0’ key with her toe. The shower was still running.<br>
<br>
“Front desk, how can I help you?” Bunny heard from the receiver on the end table. She couldn’t hear the person very well, so she presumed they wouldn’t be able to hear her well either.<br>
<br>
“I need you to call the police,” she said. She didn’t want to talk too loud, afraid that Feagins would hear her. Luckily, the person on the other end had good hearing.<br>
<br>
“What’s the problem?”<br>
<br>
“I’m being held hostage. I don’t know what room I’m in, but I need help. Please help me.” She could feel the tears forming in her eyes, and her voice was becoming a little choked up. The woman on the other end of the phone nodded, hearing the fear in her voice. She had seen enough stuff in Las Vegas to make her believe someone when they said they were in trouble.<br>
<br>
“Okay sweetie. I’ll call them right now.” She hung up the phone. The shower turned off and Bunny’s heart skipped a beat. She realized that there was no way she would be able to get the receiver back on the phone and that when Feagins saw it that she would be facing her death even sooner. She frantically tried to kick the phone off the table altogether, hoping that he would think that she tried to get the phone but was unable to. It worked, and the phone crashed to the floor. The bathroom door opened and he peered out to see what the noise had been. He saw the phone on the floor, making a beeping noise, and cocked his eyebrow at her. She looked uncomfortable and scared. He sighed, and came to sit next to her, only wearing a towel around his waist.<br>
<br>
“Sweetheart,” he paused. “Why can’t you just accept that we’re together now?” He looked over at her, and noticed that her wrist was bleeding badly. Besides looking scared, she was also looking pale. He murmured some profanities and reached out to inspect her arm closer. She tried to pull it away from him, but was unsuccessful, and only made the handcuff rip into her skin a little more. She winced and finally let the water from her eyes start to run down her face.<br>

~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Brass appeared in the doorway of the lab.<br>
<br>
“Hey Gil!” Grissom’s head shot up and he looked over at Brass. He didn’t move from the spot where he was standing though, which was practically hunched over Sara at the computer.<br>
<br>
“Yeah?” Brass gave him a compensatory smile; he knew how hard this series of cases had been on everyone.<br>
<br>
“We just got a 911 call, can you spare a CSI?” Grissom frowned.<br>
<br>
“What’s the call?” Brass shrugged, obviously not having made the connection between the call and the current case.<br>
<br>
“Hotel manager called, said a woman from one of the rooms dialed the front desk and told her to call the police because she was being held hostage.” Grissom and Sara looked at each other, Sara’s mouth having dropped open. She pushed herself out of her chair quickly and practically ran over to Brass.<br>
<br>
“I’ll go.” He eyed her suspiciously.<br>
<br>
“Just dying to spend some time with me or do you know something I don’t know?” Sara smirked.<br>
<br>
“I’m sure I know lots of things you don’t know,” she kidded. Brass and Grissom rolled their eyes. “But, this call could be about Bunny.” He furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
“Bouchard? I thought you wrapped that case up already?” Sara glanced over at Grissom, who’s neutral expression allowed her to continue.<br>
<br>
“Right, you’ve been out of town, sorry. The killer, William Feagins, gassed the entire building and took her before security could get her out of the state.” Brass’s happy exterior dropped.<br>
<br>
“Crap.” He started walking down the hallway with Sara. “It would have been nice if someone had told me about this.” Sara nodded.<br>
<br>
“They probably had other things on their mind.” Brass frowned.<br>
<br>
“Let me grab another couple officers as back up then.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Feagins was worried. Bunny was still conscious, but she was slowly slipping, her eyes closing for longer periods of time. He debated whether to call an ambulance. He didn’t think her blood loss looked that substantial, but being smaller than he was, it’s not like she had a lot of blood to lose. Plus, he was sure that the drug he had given her earlier wasn’t helping, and could be entirely responsible for her current state of losing consciousness. He shook his head; he would just need to take care of his injury himself. He carried a small first aid kit in his luggage, but he didn’t know if it would have enough to take care of her. He rummaged through his bag until he found it.<br>
<br>
An ace bandage, some gauze, a small pack of band-aids in various sizes, alcohol wipes, hydrogen peroxide, Neosporin. He sighed, and went to get a wet washcloth to clean off her wound. He came back and sat on the bed next to her still restrained arm. He didn’t want to take off the handcuffs, because he knew that she would try to escape, but he couldn’t properly take care of the cuts on her wrist if he didn’t. He got up again and dug through the pocket on another pair of pants, until his hand came out holding the key. He came back over to the bed and noticed that Bunny had closed her eyes again. He looked to her chest to make sure she was still breathing, and breathed a sigh of relief himself when he saw that she was. He unlocked her cuff and delicately placed her arm down on the bed, cringing when he saw how bad it really was. He couldn’t believe he had let this happen to the woman he was in love with. He shook away the thought that he was responsible for this and grabbed the washcloth.<br>
<br>
He had quickly cleaned up the wound as best he could, wrapping the ace bandage around the gauze that he had put around it to keep it stable. She was still out. He began to stroke her face and hair in a loving manner, and then lay down next to her. He wrapped a possessive arm across her torso and closed his eyes, and drifted into a dreamless sleep.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Nick tilted his head at the vehicles arriving in the hotel parking lot.<br>
<br>
“Something’s going on,” he observed. He and Warrick had only just gotten there themselves. They jogged over to where Brass was getting out of his car.<br>
<br>
“What’s up?” Warrick asked. Sara got out of the car and nodded at them after getting her kit.<br>
<br>
“Got a 911 call from the manager, says a woman said she was being held hostage in one of the rooms,” Sara filled them in as they made their way to the hotel’s front desk. Sara guessed the woman standing there was in her mid to late forties. The woman cocked her eyebrow at them.<br>
<br>
“Awful lot of people you brought for what could be a prank phone call,” she said. Sara glared at her, but Brass gave her a small smile that let him know who was in charge.<br>
<br>
“We have every reason to believe it wasn’t a prank phone call ma’am,” he said, the authoritative tone to her voice snapped the sarcasm out of her and she blankly nodded. “Which room?”<br>
<br>
“Twelve. It’s around back.” She turned around and grabbed something, then turned back to Brass. “Take the extra key.” She held it out for him and he took it, giving her a questioning expression. She shrugged. “Don’t want you to have to bust down the door. It’s expensive to replace those.” He nodded and left the office.<br>
<br>
“Room twelve, it’s around back,” he told the officers waiting outside. “Manager gave me the extra key,” he smiled. He looked over to Sara, Nick, and Warrick. “You three stay here.” Sara opened her mouth, about to sprout a protest, but Brass pointed his finger at her. “I mean it. You three aren’t prepared to deal with the guy who’s in there. I don’t want you getting hurt.” Sara sighed loudly in disgust. “Stay!” He motioned to the officers to follow him to the other side of the building. Sara grumbled and put her kit on the hood of the car. Her cell phone rang and she flipped it open.<br>
<br>
“Sidle.”<br>
<br>
“Hey it’s Grissom.” She smiled.<br>
<br>
“Brass is making us wait in the parking lot,” she complained.<br>
<br>
“Us?”<br>
<br>
“Nick and Warrick just got here a little before us.”<br>
<br>
“Ah.” He paused for a moment while remembering what he called her for. “We think we might have a match to who hired Feagins to take pictures of Bunny.” Sara snorted.<br>
<br>
“Ford?” Grissom furrowed his brow. He had been so pleased to figure out why that development hadn’t been sitting well with him, and Sara figured it out in a matter of seconds.<br>
<br>
“Uh, well, yes actually.” Sara’s eyes widened in surprise.<br>
<br>
“Grissom, I was just joking.” She could practically sense him rolling his eyes at her.<br>
<br>
“Well, maybe you’re more perceptive than you give yourself credit for Sara.”<br>
<br>
“Ford’s initials are F.A., not B.A.,” she argued. Grissom grinned.<br>
<br>
“Buford Abernathy.” Sara felt her stomach sink.<br>
<br>
“Any news on how he’s doing?” Despite the fact that Ford was in love with his stepsister, Sara still found his charm endearing, and felt bad that he was so badly injured that he was in the hospital.<br>
<br>
“Latest update I had was that he’s been moved to ICU instead of CCU.” Sara nodded.<br>
<br>
“Well, that’s something I guess.” Gunshots rang out through the air and Sara almost dropped her phone. “Gris, I gotta go.” She hung up the phone and the three CSIs ran to the other side of the building to see what was going on. They could see two of the officers on the ground and Nick muttered under his breath.<br>
<br>
“Christ.” Warrick nodded. They were usually used to being at the scene of a crime after it happened, not before and during. Nick glanced at Brass, silently asking for permission to come closer. Brass hung his head and then motioned for them to come over. Almost immediately, Brass had his cell phone out and was calling for an ambulance, though it would end up being the coroner’s van that would take the bodies away.<br>
<br>
“What happened?” Sara looked down at the two officers’ bodies and then back up to Brass. He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“He resisted, reached for a gun, they fired a warning shot, but he got off two shots before Murphy,” he motioned toward one of the officers still standing, “took him down.” Nick gave the man a look to acknowledge his good work. Sara peered into the room and frowned.<br>
<br>
“Did he kill her?” Bunny was still unconscious and lying on the bed, only loosely covered by a sheet. Brass gave a half grin.<br>
<br>
“Don’t know. Haven’t been in there yet,” he responded. Sara nodded and pulled her latex gloves on. She walked over to the bed and felt Bunny’s neck for a pulse. It was there, but not strong. She looked back over to Brass for a minute.<br>
<br>
“She’s alive, but just barely.” Brass let out the breath he had been holding in.<br>
<br>
“Thank God.” He said in a quiet voice. “Ambulance should be here in a couple of minutes,” he stated, looking at his watch. Sara took in the room, more specifically the bed. The handcuffs were still attached to the bed, and Sara could see the blood that had fallen from Bunny’s wrist, as it was all over the bed and floor, and on the cuff. She winced at the site. Although she could see that Feagins had bandaged up Bunny’s wrist, she scoffed. ‘It’s like shooting down a bird and mending its wing.’<br>
<br>
The ambulance sirens blared and soon the parking lot on their side of the building was a fury of lights and noise. The paramedics came into the room and put Bunny on a stretcher. Feagins and the two officers were taken away in body bags. Nick snapped Sara out of her thoughts.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“I said, just think, if Ford hadn’t hired this guy then none of this would have ever happened.” He paused, thoughtful. “Funny how things work out sometimes, huh?” Sara nodded absently. He was right of course, that had been her theory as well after Grissom told her that Ford had been the one to hire Feagins to take pictures of Bunny. That, in the beginning, he was just doing a job, but he became more and more obsessed with her in the months that followed, and eventually gave in to his own psychosis. And, Ford, who loved her, didn’t know that he had hired someone that would eventually bring his own idiosyncrasies into light. Now, both he and Bunny would be in the hospital, and neither may survive. Sara shook her head and went back to her job, collecting samples from throughout the room.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Sara visited Bunny when her shift let off. It had been three days since they found her, and although there was still a lot of paperwork left over, they were back in the swing of things with the rest of their caseload. Bunny slowly opened her eyes when Sara came into the room.<br>
<br>
“Hey, how are you doing?” Sara said in a gentle voice. Bunny just nodded.<br>
<br>
“Fine I guess. Any idea how much longer they’re going to keep me here?” Sara smiled and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“As long as they want to I guess.” Bunny gave her a mock scowl and Sara laughed. “You only just woke up yesterday, give it time.” Bunny sighed and became serious.<br>
<br>
“They told me about Ford,” she said quietly. Sara kept the solemn expression on her face, but didn’t say anything. “Do you know if he’s going to be okay?” That question caught Sara off guard. She assumed that when Bunny said they told her about Ford, that she meant about hiring Feagins, but that may have been an incorrect assumption.<br>
<br>
“What did they tell you?” Bunny frowned.<br>
<br>
“That he hired Feagins to take pictures of me, that Feagins went all psycho, that he hurt Ford pretty bad when he took me.” Bunny paused, the end of her sentence quieter than the first part. “Have you heard anything about how he’s doing?” Sara shook her head.<br>
<br>
“I can go ask someone if you’d like,” Sara offered. Bunny nodded.<br>
<br>
“That would be great. Adrian’s getting me some ice chips, so he won’t be able to hassle you about it.” Sara nodded. She got up and went into the hallway, but stopped, feeling nauseous from the emotions that she had to push down. She couldn’t see how Bunny could even think about forgiving Ford; charm can only get you so far. She shook her head, and headed toward the nurses’ station.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me,” she asked a middle-aged woman standing in front of her. “Can you tell me how Ford Abernathy is doing? Last I heard, he was in ICU.” The nurse nodded and checked the computer.<br>
<br>
“It says he’s still there. Are you family?” Sara gave her the best fake smile she could muster.<br>
<br>
“No, but my friend in room 414 is. She wanted to know how her brother was doing.” The nurse didn’t smile, but gave Sara a neutral expression.<br>
<br>
“I’ll tell his doctor to come and talk to her when he can,” she said, turning away from Sara, and taking files to another location. The elevators dinged and Sara looked over to see who was getting out.<br>
<br>
“Grissom?” She asked in surprise. He gave her a half grin.<br>
<br>
“What have I told you about getting too personally involved?” He semi kidded. She shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Bunny wants to know how Ford is doing,” she said in a quiet voice, but Grissom still heard her. He frowned.<br>
<br>
“Does she know about…?” Sara nodded before Grissom could finish the question.<br>
<br>
“I think she still thinks of him as her brother, she still loves him. I don’t know how to help her Grissom,” she admitted, a defeated quality to her voice. Grissom came closer, and reached out to touch her upper arm with his hand.<br>
<br>
“You can’t help everybody Sara. You can only do your best to find out who hurt them and get the evidence needed to put them away.” She stared into his eyes. She knew what he was saying was true, but it didn’t make it any easier. She sighed.<br>
<br>
“I feel like this is my fault, I really believed that Ford loved her,” she said. He pursed his lips.<br>
<br>
“He does. Just not in the way that you thought.” Sara nodded.<br>
<br>
“Can’t we ever just have a normal case?” Grissom grinned, and began to lead her to the elevators.<br>
<br>
“Where’s the fun in that?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FIN<br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience while I finished this. Like I said, not a very happy ending, but sometimes the show just leaves you hanging too, so there you go. <br>
