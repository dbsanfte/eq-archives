<br>
        Every event lies at the convergence of an infinite past and an infinite future, and if one follows the thread of Menelmacari expansion far enough back, one finds ones self at the Flying Islands of Jasonia, in August 2000. The Golden Age of Jasonia, self-proclaimed coolest thing in the history of anything, ever, was well underway, and two of its primary architects, Bill Dusch and Jason Steffke, had, in the course of programming a computer game, quite accidentally come across an entirely new polytheistic and rather complex religion, Soloralism, as well as the lost, technologically advanced empire of the Microns. They began preaching their new culture to their fellow Jasonians, achieving respectable if not spectacular success, but the Golden Age of Jasonia, like all other things except death, taxes, Bill being young and stupid, and inactivity in Hyperborea, came to an end, and in the great events of the succeeding years, amidst the long winter of the Collapse and the truncated glories of Tymaria, the Microns and their gods seemed lost to history a second time. But as the disillusionment of Tymarias moribundity faded away, and a new dawn of hope seemed to come to micronationalism, the lost Soloralist culture began to stir again. In its first gropings toward existence, it came across fantasy-friendly Menelmacar, and the two entered a symbiosis that has lasted the better part of a year and changed both entities forever.<br>
        Bill Dusch immigrated to Menelmacar on August 14. Jason Steffke (who was now, possibly as a result of a very selective insanity, referring to himself as Harvey) joined along with the last of the Microns, SaiKar LumEth, who the unimaginative might call his double login. Both Bill and Jason had come from the Barony of Treesia, another fantasy realm in which they had been pushing their religion but were discouraged by the high level of competition with its native Treesian Unorthodox. They opened a second Soloralist Temple of the Quintessences in Menelmacar similar to the Treesian one, and quickly found fertile ground, converting Menelmacaris Philip Locke (a new arrival from dead Freenesia), Zarathustra Erutirn (who, although still Varjan, had decided to come check out Menelmacar too) and Sirithil herself. To their luck, Soloralism already had a strong tradition of elf-related material, but they further altered a number of their myths and deities to mesh with Menelmacari culture more closely. Further, they relocated the BGI office, a center for making Soloralist micronational role-playing games, to the Menelmacari boards.<br>
        Menelmacar was also blessed around this time with the citizenship of Philip Locke, who was recovering from his Freenesian debacle. Locke had been a reasonably well-liked and productive micronationalist until he tried to destroy Tymaria in a fit of temporary insanity brought on by an overdose of Nietzsche. After the entire micronational world allied against him, he moved to working in tandem with the general scum of the micronational world to cause trouble and war, with the country of Freenesia, which actually transcended its eviality for a while, being the vehicle through which this occurred. But Locke finally had an epiphany after a particularly nasty attack, disbanded Freenesia, and, lacking a home but knowing where to go, moved to Menelmacar, dragging some of his friends/partners in crime like William Jesmer with him.<br>
        It did not stop there. Eoin Dornan, former Hubert opponent and lovably sarcastic wombat-baron of the micronational worlds leading fantasy realm, was a very early immigrant, and Fidel Nico, a communist and general shady character, was let in too under the very liberal immigration policies. Thomas Cutterham, who loathed everything for which Menelmacar stood, joined anyway for reasons which are not yet clear to me. There were also a number of other people who no one had ever heard of and who were probably spies.<br>
        And last, but certainly not least, Ryan Caruso, an old-timer who had returned with a bang by trying to restart a nation called The Peoples Republic of Hell and then going off and conquering and annexing places, decided to mellow out and join Menelmacar instead.<br>
        Menelmacar having a decent population and culture, it was now time to get some land. Sirithil requested from the Micronational Cartography Society a prime piece of land, the island chain at the far east of the map. This had been occupied for some time by Chas Jagos nation of Alteria, but Alteria had been dead as long as anyone could remember. Of course, as soon as the claim was made, who should show up but Chas Jago, claiming he had a plan to revive Alteria and asking that the land not be given away. The Cartography Society put Sirithils claims on hold for a while  a very long while  but finally she and the other Menelmacaris drove Jago away, and when his attempt to revive Alteria failed to materialize, the islands were given to the Menelmacari under the name of Feanoria. But that was not all. Philip Lockes Freenesia and Thomas Cutterhams Jaiha, both of which were now dead, were sitting around taking up space, and the two decided to give their territory to Menelmacar, making it unusually large for such a new nation.<br>
        But better luck was still to come. Bill Dusch finally grew fed up with what he viewed as Unorthodox interference with his proselytizing attempts in Treesia and decided to leave the country. He took with him the extremely large Treesian territory of Elpidos and offered it to Menelmacar in early September, with Menelmacar gladly accepting. Treesia publically took the loss in stride, although privately they grew very bitter and Eoin eventually left Menelmacar in extreme displeasure. And at about the same time, Ryan Caruso donated a large package of all the territories that his Peoples Republic of Hell had conquered under the name of Ashintully, which was also highly appreciated despite the fact that the less-than-reputable manner in which some of those territories were obtained caused trouble later.<br>
        When they annexing (or, as the Menelmacari call it, eating) fit was done, Menelmacar was second only to Shireroth in its land area, leading Philip Locke to memorably proclaim We have eaten many nations, and they are all sweet.<br>
        Somewhat less memorably, but of major symbolic importance, the Skyline wrote a long article around this time on the astounding success of Menelmacar. It ended: The example of Menelmacar goes to show that ever so often a new nation by a new person does actually work, even if only once in a blue moon. The rest of us can take heart that weve finally got some fresh blood, fresh ideas, and best of all, ACTIVITY!<br>
