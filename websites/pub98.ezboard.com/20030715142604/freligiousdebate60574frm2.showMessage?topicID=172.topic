<br>
&quot;They start daily collection calls the 1st day after the payment is due and even if you tell them that you have already sent it or when you will be sending the payment,&quot;<br>
<br>
Which they have a right to do (one can debate how this affects customer relations). All banks have levels of accounts though and if you were &quot;highly valued&quot; and had lots of money with them in other investments and a platinum you would NOT be called this quickly. Depends on past payment history and credit rating (internal and Fair Isaac) too.<br>
<br>
&quot;thay harrass you every day until they get and post the payment (which takes up to 10 days after they actually get it) Their so called customer service is non existent&quot;<br>
<br>
Firstly, this is not intended to be customer service...that's another dept, it's collections to whom you are talking. They all use predictive dialers, but it is highly irregular to be called daily so you are either exaggerating, the collector in question cannot use the system correctly, or they need to adjust the dialer...could be a combo of all 3. Notation alone doesn't stop calls, one must set out the next &quot;workdate&quot;.<br>
<br>
Harass is also a relative term and perhaps the collector is being rude. Though the FDCPA does not directly relate to you since Citifinancial is collecting on their own debt rather than 3rd party, (unless this is charged off or transferred debt), you do have optoins. They cannot make false claimes, threaten illegal action, prison etc. or call more than once a day. <br>
<br>
E-mail me privately if you want more info, but I've collected and trained collectors at all levels so I know a bit about this. I sympathize if this is your first EVER late payment, but suspect perhaps it is not and your account may then be flagged. <br>
<br>
If this is not the case, you should call the collectins department to complain and may even fax a letter requestion NO MORE calls.If they make even one more after that they have violated federal law and you have them by the balls. Not many people know this and NO collector would ever volunteer it. Will solve your problem permanently.<br>

&quot;I am not exaggerating. and there have been times when they have called 3 times in one day, which I know is illegal and I have told them this and hung up on them.&quot;<br>
You have a valid gripe here and should record the date and time of each call--these leave an automatic time stamp on the account by the autodialer. Reps can fudge notes, but you can always tell then they fucked up and are trying to cover. I'd say call the sup, but hell--just fax the letter (or mail certified or fed ex so it has to be signed for) and you're in the clear FOREVER. <br>
<br>
This is not company specific, though some are worse. It has a lot to do with individual collectors/bosses/shops.<br>
<br>
&quot;Without going into any personal financial details, lets just say with my sons medical problems we have about 10 medical bills we pay each month, so there are months when we do not make the due date.&quot;<br>
<br>
Okay, your internal credit rating with them is not so hot then and you are a more risky client. Paying late is paying late and violates the contract you signed with them no matter what the reason. Saying &quot;they get their money eventually&quot; is a poor attitude and I recommend you don't repeat that to anyone at the bank. Let me explain more here---<br>
<br>
Would it be fair for a bank to charge you more interest or deny a loan simply because your dh is on commission and not paid regularly? Then why is it okay for you to turn around and use this as an excuse. <br>
If banks can't discriminate based on commission and/or payment schedule, neither can customers.<br>
<br>
When you applied for the card/mortgage, did you make the lender FULLY aware that your husband's pay woud prohibit you from making the payment ON or BEFORE the due date each and every month as you would be contractually obligated to do? If not, and you were aware it could be a problem, this is fraud. If not, and he changed jobs the contract still stands and you should have called IMMEDIATELY when you were in good standing to get the due date changed. Changing it on a delinquent account is difficult.  <br>
<br>
Why does his getting paid between the 10-20th preclude you from paying ahead, or setting the money out ahead. If your due date is the 5th for example, this should be paid from your check on the 20th of the PREVIOUS month, not late from the new check. Ultimately, when your husband gets paid is not good excuse unless you are just not even making enough and that's another issue altogether.<br>
<br>
&quot;But they get their money and have for over 5 years, which makes me all the more annoyed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Simply meeting your obligations for 5 years (or however long) and late often times at that is what you ARE SUPPOSED TO DO BY LAW, not something special for which you deserve special consideration. You said you would pay xxxx amount on xxx day ON TIME for xxx years or until it was paid off. If you do it, good. If not, the bank owes you no special favors. Don't like this arrangement and high interest rates? Me neither, that's why I pay like a freak a month ahead if possible, have an impecable credit rating and DON'T USE CREDIT CARDS. Too long in the business I guess and they are the absolute stupidest form of loan you can take out.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I am HAPPY to know I can fax them with a request for No more calls. What legal recourse do I have if they call me after I make that request???&quot;<br>
<br>
Just look under FDCPA (Fair Debt Collections Practices Act) online or the phone book and a thousand eager attorney specialists will come up.<br>
<br>
P.S. The average person has 5 credit cards and the average balance is 4K. Pay the minimum payment on that and you won't be to 0 for 20-30 years, assuming you don't pay late and have 22% interest hike, late/OL fees etc. <br>
<br>
P.S.S. You would shit your pants to know what resources are out there for you, even if you are not poor, single parent or have children. E-mail me for specifics or I am happy to answer here. Each county is different, but all will pay your rent for a while, food is easy to get, payment plans almost easier and medical bills are THE WORLD'S EASIEST to get payment plans from (worst to collect on for this reason). Get educated and be polite and you'll get far...you can also just hang up, but why be a prisoner in your own home?<br>

<br>
No?<br>
<br>
Okay, 3 accounts, separate banks so they never draw from one to cover another without my permission.  One household account I pay a fixed budget sum to weekly, auto-deposited from main account.  This is the money DW has to run the house on for the week, groceries, gas, violin lessons, etc.  It runs dry, she has to wait for next week to do more stuff.  (Controls impulse spending and incidental budget-creep.)  Second account is checking and is used to pay all the variable sum bills each month.  Money is moved into that account on the day bills are mailed in the ammount of what was mailed to cover exactly them (there is a min. bal. sum in there at all times.)  Third account is the main one, savings,  into which all my pay is deposited directly. From this account all the fixxed bills are drafted automatically on a set schedule.  The monthly total for the fixed sum bills is the min bal I would let it drop to ever.  No checks are on this account, no ATM cards, no convenience access at all.  This prevents impulse spending and also creates an accidental windfall accrual as time goes by.  All pay goes into this account and only fixxed amounts go out.  The auto draft avoids late fees and missed payments.  It prevents me from writing 90% of the checks I used to and I only have to pay 4 bills by hand anymore.  We have a credit card but it is in a drawer in my desk (no annual fee) just to protect our credit rating.  We use it for on-line xmas purchases and send the payment in when we spend the money to show activity, but not much aside from that.<br>
<br>
It sounds crazy, but once the system was set up, it runs on auto draft mostly and I only have to hit the bank once or twice a month to xfer the &quot;checks mailed&quot; money.  It runs itself so I don't have to.  No bounced checks, late fees, bad credit, harassing calls, or effort.  If the household account runs out, we eat at home or delay the movie until next week.  If I write a check, I xfer that ammount to cover it the day I mail it.  We have more saved now than ever before in our lives and can breathe easier for it.  I hated paycheck-to-paycheck when we were starting out.  I don't ever want to go back to it.  Just spend less than you make, keep to a budget (or set up an automatic one like mine) and it all takes care of itself. <p>DBC67<br>

We have hopes of some day being credit card debt-free, but I am the queen of impulse shopping--especially online--and boy, is it hard!  I don't work (SAHM), and I swear sometimes I just shop because I'm bored!<br>
What kind of luck have you had finding a bank that doesn't have tons of fees?  The one we used seems to have upped its fees tremendously since we first started doing business with them--but who has time to shop around?<br>

Really, boring old things like budgeting and not using cards (or mailing payment on day you make purchase to show activity once in a while) works, but you hardly ever see people actually do it. Took dh 5 years to talk me into online banking with all the screw ups and mispostings I'd seen, but it truly almost runs itself, charts and categorizes all spending and even auto saves for things forecasting based on semi-annual bonuses, spending/saving trends etc....pretty cool I gotta reluctantly admit.<br>
<br>
Mony--DBC can speak directly to what he does, but I always have at least one Credit Union checking account (no fees, no minimums or atm penalties or charges on withdrawals...that's right your OWN bank can charge you for the fee they pay when you use another atm..arrggg), but this means super-duper control at the atm. My company has a free-fee ATM, but some accounts charge if you use an ATM so many times a month....take out your spending money cash at payday and then when it runs out--you are done for the period or month or whatever. B of A does online, but MSN money is great too...shop around and if you have great credit or can leave a good amount in a checking or keep a healthy min balance you'll get better deals.<br>
