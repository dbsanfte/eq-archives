A YEAR? (and apparently in that time I haven't taken the Caps Lock off . . . hmm).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I haven't even seen the board in the past year, and as such, the existence of the &quot;Literary Posts&quot; board totally escaped me. Pardon me for being an actor, but isn't this a LARP? A &quot;Live-Action&quot; Role Playing Game, as opposed to . . . say . . . an online RPG, where people post expository narratives and these are taken as the meat of the experience?<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of downtime, and encourage any type of expression that will add to the LARP experience, but I do have a few problems with what I have seen of the board, the most prominent being the posting of character histories. Honestly, if a person can't figure out enough of your character history by talking to your character, perhaps you should work on finding a character that you can more accurately portray (translation: this, as a LARP, is a game of acting, please feel free to do so). I barely know the &quot;character histories&quot; of many of my closest friends, and I'm going to be one of their bridesmaids!!! In short, I think posting character histories is undermining the LARP experience, even though it may flesh out the character and be a phenomonal piece of writing.<br>
<br>
I would like to clarify that I think many parts of a LARP should be in writing, and that online exposition is a great way to conduct downtime, in fact I plan to post the framework of the opera (that is, the parts that were not the RP) as it pertains to many players and is relevant to the game, however I would never give other players my character history for two reasons: A) in a game of intrigue, mystery, suspense and paranoia are tools of the narrative, whereas understanding and trust are counterproductive to successfully executing that narrative and B) Other players have no reason to know, what's more, if I were to encourage that much RP via written exposition, I would be afraid that so little of what was written would be incorporated into the weekly performances of the characters because it was already expressed through writing.<br>
<br>
I don't expect the forum to close, and I'm not writing an indictment of all the posts there already. I understand that we all process things such as this game differently and wish to bring up some considerations when posting, rather than stop the creative process. In short, I feel there is some information better learned in character through interaction, both from the perspective of having more fun discovering things, and from the perspective that forcing players to express and read more into our performances will heighten the Live Action gaming experience.<br>
<br>
I suppose at some point I could have included something about my opinion being humble, but it isn't and I don't really have a problem with that. If I state my opinion as fact (and I most certainly will in the future if I haven't already) and a particularly reader thinks I am citing fact, they are incorrect and I take no responsibility for inability to recognize opinion.<br>
<br>
I do like my opinions though.<br>
<br>
And one-sentence paragraphs.<br>
<br>
Sentence framents, too.<br>
<br>
For your consideration,<br>

PS. Some might react to this post by recommending I simply don't read the Literary section, or ignore the ones I don't want to read and get over it. I plan to do just that, but wanted to put forth my opinion in a way that might be a useful model to consider. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stephencrowley>Stephen Crowley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/1/03 10:20:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NOT ABOUT DRAMA (well . . .kinda, but not colloquially)</span><hr size=1> Brandon,<br>
<br>
Valid points. The only problem is there are certain interesting aspects of our characters which, for various reasons, cannot be handled in game. Just as an example, interactions with humans, of which we usually have none, not counting ghouls and the occasional mage.<br>
<br>
That, and I think you'll find after reading them that some of them are damn entertaining.<br>

I'm a writer at heart, and a lot of character development isn't done with shallow or non-interaction with other players, or stressing over 24 Sabbat stomping down the streets.  It's who the character is, what they do in their downtimes... and unfortunately, we as players don't have time to roleplay a week from 9pm - 12 midnight. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

To be on the outside looking in is wonderful, I must say.  Go, read some of the literaries.  Those who choose to post should be able to post, and those who don't want to, or disagree with it, well, don't post, and don't read.<br>

Your points all have validity, but I feel you may have overlooked one small thing that I think is very important to the literary boards. Many of us are not truely actors. I myself am a technitian, much afraid of the light in center stage. I am a coreographer and a set designer. I have written plays, and blocked stages for a very long time. I have done 22 shows in my career as a stage tech, everything from a carpenter to a designer to a stage manager. The one thing, in all those shows I was never able to do was act. Some of us who LARP, do so tentatively. we want desperately to be able to fully assume the roles we create for ourselves, yet seem to lack the motivations, or share the desires that would spur our characters. Yet, in a forum based on writing, where we are not faced with the direct reactions of others at the moment we hit the send button, we can create the depth and texture that we would still like to do, in a live setting. unlike Live roleplaying, we have the convienience of a backspace key, to correct little misteaks. Without this format, many of us who would otherwise be plagued by lack of confidence to bring to life a character that deserves the depth we attempt to give them. Here, many of us can think out, plot and develop a character that supposedly has lived more than their fair share of life times. In its own way; even tho it may reveal a bit too much or give away little secrets, writing in the Literaries, might allow some of us to build confidence in our characters, and bring that with us on Friday night. maybe it will give us a little more to bring into the &quot;Live Action&quot; portion of our game on friday night, and make the interactions that much richer, and more enjoyable. In a way, maybe the confidence of our character, will help us, to be more confident as we represent that character. Actors speak of &quot;Motivation&quot; are we not then actors, seeking motivations for the characters we portrait every friday night? Yet unlike actors who protrait characters in a movie, we protrait them on the streets, session after session, for years sometimes. I am a writer, a set designer, a stage combat coreographer, a sound and lighting technitian, a carpenter and electrician, and until I became a live-action RolePlayer, I had never acted. Now, after writing the stories in my head about fantastical vampires onto paper, and occasionaly into electronic forums, and attempting to assume that role on the streets,I think I may now begin to add &quot;Actor&quot; to my list of accomplishments. Perhaps writing in a literary forum is not technically &quot;LiveAction&quot; roleplaying, but for many of us, it is this forum, that gives Life to that which we attempt to portrait.<br>

<br>
I enjoy the literary posts simply because they tend to flush out a character that might not get the chance to grow due to the 3-4 hours a week we spend in character.  It's our opportunity to create subtlety, nuance, and fire in our character as well as entertain the other players and Staff during the wekk.  It is yet another creative outlet in the WoD.  Being told a blanket statement about a character is one thing but getting to read a piece of their history is another.  I can explain that my character is a Hunter all day long...but it adds to the presence of the character if the players OOC have some sort of reference.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion...<br>
<br>
I enjoy the Literary posts and plan to continue writing once auditions are done.<br>
