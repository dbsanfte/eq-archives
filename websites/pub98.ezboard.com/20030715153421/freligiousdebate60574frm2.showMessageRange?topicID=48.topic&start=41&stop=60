<br>
According to YOU, not Satanists. Starting to get it now? Many may find xianity evil and not want their children around it anymore than you want yours around Satan. You either support SOCAS or you don't, picking and choosing which beliefs are evil just proves you don't get the core issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not want to stand by while someone invites the Enemy of God into the room. Now if an Athesist believes in &quot;the Satanic bible&quot;, they have specifically chosen a symbol which is in its nature offensive to Christians and others and by the nature of its title it is disrespectful or spiteful and that to me is not &quot;very cordial&quot; &quot;<br>
<br>
As is your bible offensive to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> Satanic prayer is the enemy of god only to you and those like you...not to Satanists, many pagans or atheists. Your prayers are offensive in the same way and all this is why govt has no business in religion and religion has no business outside objective study in schools.<br>
<br>
&quot;Non Christians just dont get why we do missionary work. It is out of love and concern for the spiritual well being of all of our brothers and sisters.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's where you are wrong. I know why you do it, the accountability bit and all that. YOU don't seem to get how offensive and rude it is, and don't go on about how it can be refused.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We've all heard of LDS in this country and if we don't come to you, look it up online or ask you for info that's as good as saying &quot;no thank you&quot; for now. Course if you are an advocate of prosyletizing just post your address and phone number and I'll make sure a friendly atheist visits you regularly to spread the good word about logic and reason.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Faith in Christ does not leave room for &quot;all roads lead to the same place.&quot; Yes others may have a religion, but there is but one truth and if I know I have it,I cant accept others beliefs as true. &quot;<br>
<br>
And so would say the Jew, JW, Muslim etc. You all have the truth and everyone else is wrong...and the whole rest of the world just doesn't get why you are lovingly harassing us to death with the truth...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  blah, blah, the other side blah, blah, my friend blah blah.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can accept their right to believe as they choose, but it does not mean that I have to accept that what they believe is going to save them.&quot;<br>
<br>
You don't have to, just leave us alone. <br>
<br>
&quot;It just isnt logical to be complacent, it isnt congruent with the gospel.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, well that's okay since logic has nothing to do with the gospels anyway. Tell you what...hows about you show us the respect of treating us like intelligent adults who can make these life choices and get the info from you when we WANT it? I'm totally willing to reciprocate and treat you that way too....see that's the wonderful difference between free-thinkers and missionaries, we respect the intelligence and free will of the average person. <br>

You cant decide whether or not you like rocky road ice cream unless you taste it for yourself.  Just becuse you like Vanilla becuase you have tried vanilla doesnt mean that you wont like Rocky road.<br>
<br>
The fact that we have 100's of thousands of converts each year should tell you that some people are happy we came knocking on their door.  At least 30 of the people I met in Costa Rica were happy that I came by. It changed their lives in a way that they are grateful for.<br>
<br>
If Satanist do not believe that Satan is the enemy to God? just who do they think he is??????????????????????????? I would love to know.<br>
<br>
My bible is not specifically intended to offend, the name of the Satanic bible if created by atheists was designed specifically to offend.  If it was written by those who believe in Satan, then it is evil.  Plese provide proof otherwise.  It dirves me nuts that you use that example as you do it just because you know how Christians feel about Satan, but in my lifetime I have only met one believer in Satan and HE WAS EVIL.  It isnt like there are a flock of Satanist running around practicing a wholesome belief non threatening belief system.  Atheists( or people who do not belief that Satan really exists) who call themsleves SAtanists are just trying to stir up trouble.  It isnt a religigion at all, its just a philosophy.<br>
<br>
Have you read the book of Mormon, have you attended an LDS service, have you ever prayed to know if the things we teach are true? if not then you really dont know enough aobut my religion to accept or reject it.  <br>
<br>
I agree that most all religions believe that they have the truth, but if they are never given the opportunity to hear from others and weigh and compare and pray about what they believe, then they will never really know.<br>
<br>
Lots of so called intelligent people assumed the world was flat.  But just because they were under a false sense of understanding should they just have been left alone and their belief in a flat world respected?  You know Im sure they had heard that silly round world idea and if they had wanted to know more they couldve just looked up someone who believed that whooey.  <br>
<br>
There is only one truth and if we dont try to share what we believe (christian , muslim jew) then that says a whole lot about the way we feel towards our fellowman. --- I do not understand why you feel it is so offensive to share what we feel to be something of eternal consequence.<br>
<br>
If I came up with a cure for all cancer today and just decided that everybody seemed fine with chemo and other current treatments you know why rock the boat.  Well I care enough to want to save life in this life, why would  I care less about saving life in the eternities. You are free to reject, but I dont offer, then I am selfish and cannot reasonably call myself sincere in my beliefs. - Shirene<br>

I would love to know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Every Satanist I know does not see him as a god or demon in the way xians do. They do not feel their book or mission is to offend either, nor do they wish to harm those that disagree with them. The Satanic Bible is very clear about this. You may actually wish to read about this someday as Satanists also feel their beliefs are misunderstood.<br>
<br>
&quot;My bible is not specifically intended to offend,&quot;<br>
<br>
so what? Intention is irrelevant here as it is with sexual harassment in the workplace. Your bible was written to exclude and I find that and it's call to harm unbelievers such as myself and my family offensive.<br>
<br>
&quot;the name of the Satanic bible if created by atheists was designed specifically to offend.&quot;<br>
<br>
Atheists did not write the Satanic Bible (I refer here to the Anton Levy book).<br>
<br>
&quot;It dirves me nuts that you use that example as you do it just because you know how Christians feel about Satan, but in my lifetime I have only met one believer in Satan and HE WAS EVIL.&quot;<br>
<br>
Says you. It drives Satanists nuts to be portrayed as murderous child molesters too. See how it's not okay to impose your views of someone's religion on others?<br>
<br>
&quot; It isnt like there are a flock of Satanist running around practicing a wholesome belief non threatening belief system.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes it is. Plese tell me when the last child molestation ring or any other harmful group was sponsored by Satanists. It's bunk and xian propoganda. They ARE practicing a non-threatening system...xians on the other hand...<br>
<br>
&quot;It isnt a religigion at all, its just a philosophy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Perhaps, but so is Buddhism. Is it okay then to treat this belief system as less? By your standards yes, by mine absolutely not.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you read the book of Mormon, have you attended an LDS service, have you ever prayed to know if the things we teach are true?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes and I reject it. JWs and Protestants have also done so and rejected it. You assume non-conversion = ignorance, a mighty big assumption. <br>
<br>
&quot;I agree that most all religions believe that they have the truth, but if they are never given the opportunity to hear from others and weigh and compare and pray about what they believe, then they will never really know.&quot;<br>
<br>
And this madates prosyletizing and tying it to humanitarian aid how?<br>
<br>
&quot;Lots of so called intelligent people assumed the world was flat. But just because they were under a false sense of understanding should they just have been left alone and their belief in a flat world respected?&quot;<br>
<br>
No, it means they were provided PROOF, EVIDENCE, REASONED arguments for it to peruse at THEIR leisure and choice...not door-to-door round earth prosyletizers. See the difference?  <br>
<br>
&quot;There is only one truth and if we dont try to share what we believe (christian , muslim jew) then that says a whole lot about the way we feel towards our fellowman.&quot;<br>
Sharing is not the same as prosyletizing and tying it to humanitarian aid. Many LDS shared their beliefs with me...in conversations and at MY request.<br>
<br>
&quot;If I came up with a cure for all cancer today and just decided that everybody seemed fine with chemo and other current treatments you know why rock the boat.&quot;<br>
<br>
Would you go door to door with your cancer? Would you have proof it worked? Would you continue to hound people who refused it when the info was out there, assuming they were either evil or stupid?<br>
<br>
I believe you are sincere, just following misguided dictates of an exclusionary and elitist belief system. I find your assumptions and refusal to respect my intelligence offensive and your mudslinging against atheists/satanists ill-informed and interesting considering your claims.<br>

First of all I just want to say that JWs also have hundreds of thousand of converts every year and we also have members in 235 different lands.  There were over 6 million Witnesses in the world at the end of 2001.  Our religion is growing every year.  I would have to say that we have found a few people that don't like vanilla or rocky road.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also, I am wanting to know if you have invited a Witness into your house to here what we have to say?  If so, how many times did you talk to them?  And did you listen (meaning did you learn what our beliefs are), or did you try to witness instead?  I am sincerely asking, not trying to be a butt.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

When he first showed up, I was thinking, &quot;Why not?  Never actually invited one in - come on in, I think I know what you believe, I know what I believe, so let's talk and see what happens!&quot;<br>
<br>
Trish, he kept coming back, and coming back, and coming back...he even pushed his way past my dh one day when we were on our way out the door getting ready to go away for the weekend (suitcases in the hallway in plain sight!).  That did it...I figured there was no problem with the first 2 or 3 times he came over and we talked, but when he ignored our request to come back another time, and barged into my home...I stopped being polite and welcoming.  <br>

Yes the pros. missionaries do service whereever they are, but we have a whole other program for humanitarian aid.  Sat or Sunday in the Deseret News there was an article of a Muslim leader coming to SLC to talk to Utahn muslims, it was his first time here but other muslim leaders have been here before when we coordinated relief and aid efforts to give them to use in their own programs.<br>
<br>
Every time there is a drastic crisis somewhere in the world, we send food and aid.  Another article I read a few weeks ago in the church news talked about local scientists creating a storable and shipable version of a local African &quot;mush&quot; to send to a drought racked part of Africa.  We can and do, do both without tying them to each other.<br>
<br>

_ I have no problem with people who have chosen to be athesists, I do have a problem with Satanists.  You told me what they dont think Satan is.  What do they think satan is and if not a diety or fallen angel?  Why call it Satanism?  Satan is the angel of light that was cast out of heaven for rebellion, do they think he got a bum rap?  please please enlighten me.<br>

Trish - I have invited JW's in more times than I can count.(3-4 times int he last year)  I have studied a lot of your beliefs and I think we agree on some points but there are fundamental points of doctrine that I do not agree with.  No Blood transfusions, no birthday celebration because a few wicked people did some bad things on theirs or someone's birthday, only 144,000 in heaven with God, the fact that the JW bible has some verses deleted, that there is nothing going on with our spirits after we die or that we did not live with God before we were born.   These are doctrines I do not believe.<br>
<br>
I have studied many different christian religions (vanilla, rocky road, pineapple sherbert, )  quite a bit of jewish history and religion, a tiny bit of Muslim ( one or two tapes on the beginning of the Muslim religion - a tiny spoon sample of strawberry)  and I like Rocky Road (pun intended <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  And I will share my rocky road with anyone who wants a taste <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  -- Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 335<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/12/03 12:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  re: conversions and POV</span><hr size=1> &quot; How does my bible tell me to hurt you and your family?&quot;<br>
<br>
You're kidding right? Okay, here are a few I can remember on the fly, and I'm counting on your knowledge of the verses to help. Some of these include your god's instructions to harm or kill pagans and non-xians but it's really applied to us when it comes down to it...an infidel is an infidel is an infidel...<br>
<br>
Psychics, wizards, and so on are to be stoned to death.  (Leviticus 20:27)<br>
Anyone who curses or blasphemes God, should be stoned to death by the community.  (Leviticus 24:14-16)<br>
This applies to me just about every day and actually to anyone who ever says, &quot;Oh my god&quot; in horror, surprise, shock etc. Grab your rocks people we got alot of catching up to do...<br>
<br>
Anyone who dreams or prophesizes anything that is against God, or anyone who tries to turn you from God, is to be put to death. (Deuteronomy 13:5)<br>
<br>
If anyone, even your own family suggests worshipping another God, kill them. (Deuteronomy 13:6-10)<br>
<br>
If you find out a city worships a different god, destroy the city and kill all of it's inhabitants... even the animals. (Deuteronomy 13:12-15)<br>
<br>
Kill anyone with a different religion. (Deuteronomy 17:2-7)<br>
<br>
And if you are about to give the tired old line that the OT doesn't matter anymore, then I don't ever want to hear you speak against homosexuality (another horrible offense punishable by death in YOUR bible). You can argue some of the bible is allegorical, but we aren't talking 7 days creation stuff here...killing is pretty clear cut.<br>
<br>
Oh---and how does the bible hurt myself and daughter? We've hashed this out NUMEROUS times, but here are just a few tidbits.<br>
<br>
Women are deceptive liars who are punished for eternity (such a nice creation story...I really miss Lilith) after a woman has given birth to a boy, she will be unclean for 7 days and must purify herself for 33 days.  If she gives birth to a girl, she is unclean for 14 days and needs 66 days of purification.<br>
Women=dirty, evil, deceptive, manipulative, submissive<br>
<br>
And don't you ever try to be the boss of a man...not if you've read Timothy chapter 2. It does not say only your husband either, but is clear women are never to be above men and are to dress plainly. (for our own protection I suppose). Women are to learn in silence and cannot teach nor &quot;usurp authority over the man&quot;.  <br>
<br>
On Satanism..it's pretty clear you have NEVER invited a Satanist or member of the Church of Set in your home, nor have you read their literature with an open mind. You assume they worship the enemy of your god and this colors everything you hear about them, most of which comes undoubtedly comes from non-Satanist sources. What a hypocrite you are to always whine that other xians don't go to LDS sources to get info on LDS, then you turn around and do the same thing to Satanists and who knows who else?<br>
Since it seems your are incapable or unwilling to do a simple search allow me to paste in the first link that came up and the offical website <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.churchofsatan.org/">www.churchofsatan.org/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
DBC knows more Satanists than I, so can better speak to this probably, but I say do a little research and stop calling the kettle black.<br>
<br>
My dh was raised JW, my MIL still is and we have attended their service around Easter. They are WAY more consistent with the bible, stay away from pagan celebrations (you know---things of Satan your enemy of god) and are more knowledgeable about the bible than any other sect I have found. I don't agree with them, but only one group outside my MIL's friends and congregation have come to the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I will share my rocky road with anyone who wants a taste.&quot;<br>
Ah--and herein lies the heart of our conversation. I think this is great to want to share your rocky road, just do go door-to-door with it assuming I'm too stupid or lazy to know it exists and where to go pick up a pint! <br>

Not to those who believe light is good and dark is bad...you know like the way your god punished those who disobeyed him by darkening their skin. Your paradigm around this is at once neither surprising nor comforting and has led many to racism and other ugly things. You may not like his language, but his religion has murdered billions less than yours.<br>

And your bible speaks of raping women, cutting the foreskins off men to get a bride, killing non-believers, women submitting to men, women giving birht and menstruating being unclean and those who touch them being harmed and killed. I've read both and though I don't recommend either for children, your bible is way more murderous and bloodthirsty.

If you did it would be all over the news and textbooks, instead you sell your mysticism and intolerance door-to-door like vacuum salesmen peddling fear and the promise of eternal rewards to those gullible enough to buy. <br>

I don't doubt fellings exist. I do say their &quot;feelings&quot; are not proof of god. I don't and can't prove a negative and we've been here before. For Maude's sake, if you are going to be on a debate board at least try to use logic and stick to the point at hand. If you want to whine about how I don't think warm, fuzzy feelings of the spirit are convincing start another thread or just go to a religious board and preach. <br>

If you want physical proof for everything, it is you who is on the wrong board.<br>
<br>
You were the one who brought up the idea that everyone knows about us and knows where to look for us.  I was just pointing out that that statement was &quot;stupid and misinformed&quot; because not everybody does know who we are and what we believe.  I wasnt whining.  I am still suprised that you have taken this to a name calling attack, instead of just dealing with the issues. <br>
<br>
Over 200,000 people last year did join the church and most of those were found by the missionaries.  <br>
<br>
If it wasnt working or people were not accepting the gospel, we wouldnt be doing it.  Knocking on someones door isnt hounding them.  If they were knocking on your door every day or telling you that you are going to hell if you dont stop and listen that may be hounding, But Heck I see the Kirby vacuum salesman more often than I see missionaries of other faiths in my neighborhood.<br>
<br>
As a missionary in Costa Rica, we didnt knock doors at all, we just talked to people on the bus or on the street, I never persued a conversation with anyone who was not interested in talking to us. Some people chose to listen to our message, some did not.  My focus was on those who wanted to hear, not on the people who politely said no thanks.<br>
<br>
Its kinda like that chaplain thing, religion is not something anyone should be coerced into doing.  Our job as missionaries is finding those who want to hear.   And sometimes knocking on doors is the way to find them. (otherwise we would give it up) - Shirene<br>
<br>
I am not even going to give you the satisfaction of trying to defend the race issue. The &quot;Darkness&quot; that the little Satanist was talking about has nothing to do with race, that was just a cheap attempt on your part to paint me as something I am not.  Those who know me in Real life would get a barrel laugh out of that accusation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 341<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/12/03 10:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Religious debate board for theists only!?!!?!</span><hr size=1> &quot;Well this is a RELIGIOUS debate board and God and spiritual things are a pretty significant part of religion.

So no atheists allowed on the religious debate board?

Perhaps you have us confused with the xian part of this board?<br>
<br>
&quot;You were the one who brought up the idea that everyone knows about us and knows where to look for us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes and I stand by that. You feel misunderstood by other xians just as they do by you. I can tell by your comments to Totalfeline that you don't know that much about Jehovah's Witnesses and they too get converts so this really proves nothing in the end. You have several times whined on several threads (mostly to Candy and Heather) about their sources and not going straight to www.LDS.org or whatever it is-not just here, then you turned around and said lots of things about Satanists (and JW's too but I'll let her address any of those she wants too) that you DIDN'T get from the source.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Over 200,000 people last year did join the church and most of those were found by the missionaries.&quot;<br>
<br>
And thousands Native Americans and others were converted to xianity, mostly by conquering white men. Shall we promote imperialism and slaver again since it was so successful? <br>
<br>
&quot;If it wasnt working or people were not accepting the gospel, we wouldnt be doing it.&quot;<br>
<br>
A truth of which I am sadly well-aware. More converts, more tithing, more power...you all must be so very proud--especially since mission work was a big point of the conference this year. Big surprise you're touting it here!<br>
<br>
&quot;I see the Kirby vacuum salesman more often than I see missionaries of other faiths in my neighborhood.&quot;<br>
<br>
Because the Kirby guy and other faiths are more respectful...goodness sakes how has Judaism and Islam survived without this kind of loving missionary work??? Hmmmm....<br>
<br>
&quot;we just talked to people on the bus or on the street&quot;<br>
oh yes, getting them on the way to work or running errands on public transport and the streets...yes you WERE a considerate bunch! <br>
<br>
&quot;I am not even going to give you the satisfaction of trying to defend the race issue.&quot;<br>
We've covered the racism of your Heavenly Father before and if you want to actually read something not published by LDS take a look at the many studies of the language of racism. You don't like the &quot;dark greeting&quot; for no other reason than the word dark...big surprise my Mormon sister, big surprise. I don't think you're stringing anyone up, but don't skirt the issue of your assumption that dark=evil.<br>
<br>
Oh yes and your reference to &quot;that little Satanist&quot; proves you cannot objectively look at the literature of another belief system and think for yourself to judge it even when a link is provided for you....too bad, but your loss. Show me one bit of evidence there are bands of Satanists roving the country harming people (you know like the Army of God or something) and you'll start having some kind of point.

Hey wanted to say that I went to the website this morning after reading over what you were saying and what Shirene was saying. I didn't get into the Satanic Bible, but instead read the F.A.Q.<br>
<br>
VERY informative, where's DBC when you need him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , would love to ask him some questions. But anyway, I came away with a deeper understanding of who they are and what they are. <br>
<br>
Shirene, reading the faq would show you more then just a quote on the entrence of the webpage. As for why they call themselves satanist, it is starting to make sense to me. But I need to read more.<br>

I do not think that dark greetings is a positive thing when Christ has said that he is the light of the world.  Light is the only way that we see things.  Light makes things grow.  Is light a positive thing? Of Course!<br>
<br>
But that has nothing to do with the way I feel about my brown brothers and sisters. <br>
<br>
Just an example of me.... when my daughter was about one years old we came out of a store, coming in to the store was an African American man who bore a strong resemblence to my husband (who is Italian by the way with very nice 'dark' skin)  My dd saw him and called out &quot;Daddy&quot;  He was quite amused, and me.... I was thrilled that my dd is what I like to call color blind.   But you are still trying to paint me as a racist because spiritually &quot;darkness&quot;  is representative of the Evil one.  He is dark, in that he decieves and lies and twists things, just like the shadows you saw in your bedroom as a little kid.  Darkness hides what things really look like.  It doesn't portray an accurate picture of the world around us. Light does, that is why Christ is the light of the world and Satan or the devil is called the Prince of darkness. <br>
<br>
As far as telling you that you're on the wrong board, merely responding to your persistant desire for physical proof of the spiritual.  I have said and others have said a number of times that part of the whole reason for this life is to develop faith.  Faith is the belief of the unseen.  God can provide proof after the faith, it can be felt but not shared.  It is individual.  I know it is real as anything, but I cant give it to you.  It is a gift from God to anyone who is sincere in wanting to find Him.  I wish I could just give it to you, but I cant.  Not because it doesnt exist, but because it is not mine to give.  The parable of the 10 virgins talks about this.  The spirit of God is represented as oil in the lamps.  The five who had it were not able to give the other five any oil.  Not because they had no compassion, but it just couldnt be shared.  If you want proof of God, you have to go directly to Him. - Shirene<br>

This little gem is unique to LDS, but you NEVER account for it, except to say god changed his mind.<br>
<br>
Candy/Trish--has your religion ever preached that blacks/Native Americans are that color as punishment for disobedience to god? Have your missionaries/members ever refused to preach/convert the darker colored humans on the planet?<br>
<br>
Perhaps I am wrong and don't realize that noone's god felt all humans were worthy until the latter half of this century. I look forward to receiving good info if this is the case. <br>
<br>
Shirene-You may not be lynching anyone personally, but it is ridiculous to claim this racist action/theology has no affect on you. The problem is that once your sect decided it was not politically expedient to be openly racist (or perhaps you were running out of non-black converts), you could bring forth a new &quot;revelation&quot;, but are stuck with the racist text in your religious book. <br>
<br>
One can make the same connection with sexism. If the purpose of women is to breed and a woman is to be beneath and submissive to men, have an elder &quot;counsel&quot; her if she does not wish to have any children or...&lt;gasp&gt; marry, then how does this not translate into such a man's views of his female co-workers? I would never suggest oulawing a religion, but one can hardly be a part of a highly sexist belief system and not have this bleed into all areas of his life. This is where I get hurt and my daughter gets hurt and women in general get hurt and there is a slew of literature on how language affects, reinforces and supports this as well. It is clear that less conservative sects/members of these sexist ideologies have better attitudes toward women in the workplace, but this is not to say liberal xians are exempt from it....just illustrating the point.<br>

As for your comment a debate board is no place for atheists since we don't accept faith as proof...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I suggest you take your appeal to emotion, circular reasoning, ad populum, hypocrisy and spiritual faith to a religious support board if you can't take the heat or demand for reason here. There are boards to which I could refer you run by xians who would laugh at your posts as much as I do. You see, I am not saying that NO xian can make a good argument or demonstrate a better knowledge of history. I am saying you have not yet done so, didn't in this thread, the Satanic, etc. etc. <br>
<br>
Shirene-decide what rules you want to play by and be consistent. The fact that you cannot defend you system as other xians here can and that you spread falsehoods about other beliefs has eroded your credibility as much as your foot stomping. It's disappointing and unattractive, but not irreconcilable. Do what you have to to educate your self and firm up your position so you don't find yourself in the unfortunate position you have the last few days. I don't want to ignore your posts, but if you can't offer something new or substantial outside of whining I don't know what else to do with your electronic tempertantrums.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You are absolutely right!!  But I'll go a step further (and hope I don't get too OT).   <br>
<br>
One of the ways Jim Jones (of the infamous Jonestown cult) kept his followers &quot;brainwashed&quot; (for want of a better word) was by broadcasting his speeches throughout the community on an almost constant basis.  It seems similar to the tactics taken by dictators who plaster their images every ten yards thorughout a country.  I'm no sociologst, but I wouldn't pit that kind of mental saturation against a lifetime of devout belief and expect the belief to win even 50% of the time.  Nor do I have much doubt that that is the very intention of those who urge prayer in schools.  No, my kid doesn't have to participate, but how succesful might twelve years of almost daily prayer have in converting a good many otherise non-Xian children in this country?  How long would it take for, say, a daily pagan ritual to chip away at the belief system of a Xian child?  I see no better reason for schools, prisons, or any other cumpulsory public place to be a religion free zone (aside from academic study).<br>

Q. Why couldn't black men hold the Priesthood in the Mormon Church before 1978?<br>
A. Some black men did hold the Mormon Priesthood before 1978! But except in the case of Elijah Abel and his descendants, and Walker Lewis, all men of Hamitic lineage (bloodline) were forbidden to hold the LDS Priesthood before 1978. However, black-skinned men of non-Hamitic lineages, like the Dravidians of India, the Aborigines of Australia, the Melansians of Fiji and Melanesia, and the Negritoes of the Philipines and Indonesia, all had a right to the Priesthood, and those who were worthy Members of the Church held it before 1978. Also, white-skinned Hamites could not hold the Priesthood or partake of the higher ordinances of Mormon Temples until 1978.<br>
<br>
Why? This is explained below.<br>
<br>
The Priesthood~Ban<br>
<br>
The &quot;Priesthood-ban&quot; was a &quot;ban&quot; on the Priesthood for all male Mormons who had &quot;one drop&quot; of Hamitic blood in their veins; whatever their skin color. True, the vast great majority of &quot;Hamites&quot; today belong to the &quot;African&quot; race; a race of brown-skinned and black-skinned people originating in sub-saharan Africa. However, white-skinned people (even with blond hair and blue eyes) who had Hamitic blood in them were also denied the Priesthood and the higher ordinances of Mormon Temples if it was determined they had &quot;Hamitic&quot; blood (i.e. if they had a lineage back to Ham, the son of Noah). The &quot;Priesthood~ban&quot;, as it is called, wasn't really a question of skin-color but of lineage or bloodline. Anyone having one drop of Hamitic lineage was denied the Priesthood (if he was male--only men can hold the Mormon Priesthood), and whether male or female they were also denied the higher ordinances of Mormon Temples (endowments and sealings but not baptisms for the dead). That changed via a Revelation from the LORD in 1978. Since that time, men of Hamitic lineage have received the Priesthood, and all Hamites can receive all the ordinances, blessings, and offices in the Church that anyone else can.<br>
<br>
The Priesthood-ban was based upon several verses in a book of Mormon Scripture called The Book of Abraham, which is in a volume of scripture known as The Pearl of Great Price; which, along with the Bible, The Book of Mormon, and The Doctrine &amp; Covenants, is one of the four Standard Works of the LDS Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith claimed to have divinely translated The Book of Abraham from some ancient Egyptian papyrus he came accross in the late 1830s. The papyrus came from Thebes, and included some Egyptian funeral texts. Joseph Smith studied these, and received the revelation we know call The Book of Abraham. In the first chapter of that small book Abraham writes that Pharoah, the king of Egypt, was &quot;a righteous man&quot;, but could not hold the Priesthood because he was a descendant of Ham, and the Hamitic lineage or bloodline was &quot;blessed with wisdom&quot; but &quot;cursed as pertaining to the Priesthood&quot; (Abraham 1:26). In another revelation of Joseph Smith, called The Book of Moses, also in The Pearl of Great Price, it says that the Cainites, the descendants of Cain, the son of Adam, were &quot;black&quot; (Moses 7:22).<br>
<br>
From the time of Brigham Young onward, Mormon Church Presidents (whom Mormons believe to be Prophets, Seers, and Revelators of the LORD) have interpreted these verses as Negroes being of the Cainite/Hamitic bloodline, and would not be allowed to hold the Priesthood until the Abelites first had the opportunity. A brief explanation of the Curse of Cain and a brief overview of its history in the LDS Church is as follows: <br>
<br>
Cain, the eldest son of Adam, had the birthright to the Holy Priesthood. He and his descendants (the Cainites) had the right to receive it first. But Cain offerred a sacrifice to the LORD in a state of unworthiness, or wickedness. The LORD did not accept this offerring, but rejected it. Because Abel's offerring was made in a state of worthiness, or righteousness, the LORD accepted Abel's offering, and Cain lost his birthright to Abel; his younger brother.<br>
<br>
Cain, being jealous and angry, decided to kill Abel; mistakenly thinking that the birthright to the Priesthood would revert back to him. After this was done, the LORD cursed Cain; made him a wandering upon the earth, and put a 'mark' upon him so that anyone recognizing him would not kill him. The 'mark' of Cain was a black skin. This was not the curse, but actually a mark of protection from the LORD. The ground would not yield fruit for him. He was to wander the earth. This is known as &quot;The Curse of Cain&quot;.<br>
<br>
Instead of Cain's descendants receiving the birthright first, they would receive it last. The first shall be last, and the last shall be first. The Cainites would be banned from receiving the Priesthood until Abel was resurrected, had children, and all of Abel's children received it first. Then the curse would be removed from the descendants of Cain, and they would receive the Priesthood and all the blessings thereof.<br>
<br>
The Sethites (the descendants of Seth--the third son of Adam and Eve) and the Cainites (the descendants of Cain) were not allowed to intermarry. However, this did happen. The result was corruption, and the LORD decided to destroy the Adamites in a great flood. He chose Noah to save himself, his wife, and his sons, and their wives; along with two of every kind of useful animal in the Ark. According to Mormon teachings, the wife of Ham was Egyptus: a Cainite woman. Thus, the Cainite bloodline, or lineage, continued through the Flood. The descendants of Ham and his Cainite wife Egyptus were Mizraim, Cush, Put, and Canaan. The descendants of Mizraim, Cush, and Put settled in North Africa. Mizraim is the Hebrew name for &quot;Egypt&quot;. Cush is the Hebrew name for Nubia (now Sudan), and Put is thought to have settled in what is now the Ethiopia region. Joseph Smith believed that Negroes were &quot;the sons of Cain&quot; (i.e. the descendants of Cain), and most Mormon Presidents and Apostles have had the same belief. That would mean that black Africans are Cainites (descendants of Cain through Egyptus, the wife of Ham), and Sethites (the descendants of Noah via Ham) as well as Hamites (the descendants of Ham). The Canaanites did not settle in North African, but in the land of Canaan; which is now called Israel, or Palestine.<br>
<br>
Elijah Abel, a black man of African descent, and his male descendants, have always had the Holy Priesthood. This is explained because Elijah Abel was of such great faith, that the LORD made an exception in his case and with his descendants. There is a similar situation in the Bible in The Book of Ruth. Because the Moabites (a white-skinned people who were the descendants of Lot, the nephew of Abraham) did not give food or water to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt into the desert, the LORD cursed them; proclaiming that a Moabite would not enter the Congregation of the LORD until the 10th generation (Deut. 23:3). However, Ruth, a 1st generation Moabitess, showed such great faith that the LORD made an exception, and she became an Israelite. Jesus Himself was a descendant of Ruth and Obed. The descendants of Elijah Abel are all white; because Abel's sons and daughters married white Mormons back in the late 19th century.<br>
<br>
Hamites, of whatever skin-color, could not hold the Priesthood or partake of the Higher Ordinances of Mormon Temples; which include Endowments and Sealings. However, they could enter Mormon Temples to be baptized for the dead. They could be Members of the Church. But they could not serve as missionaries. From the 1840s to the early 1960s the Church never had more than 1000 black Members of African descent. However, in the mid-1960s some black Africans started to receive visions in which Jesus or an angel told them about the Church. Some of these black Africans began to find information about the Church, and to preach and form entire congregations, and sometimes theirown denominations with tens of thousands of black Africans as members. They called themselves 'Mormons' and 'Latter-day Saints'. The Church tried to encourage these people, but the men were not ordained to the Priesthood.<br>
<br>
In the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s the Church received much negative media attention because of the Priesthood-ban. The Church issued strong statements condemning racism, and encouraging its Members to stand for the civil-rights of all Americans; but they also declared that the Priesthood-ban was of the LORD, that it had nothing to do with the 'civil-rights' of Americans, and that only the LORD, the Author of the ban, could lift it.<br>
<br>
In 1978, the Church was building a Temple in Sao Paulo, Brasil. At that time there were tens of thousands of Mulatto Mormons in Brasil; people with both white and black ancestry. These people had great faith, and sacrificed much to build the Temple in Sao Paulo; the largest city in Brazil. Many of these people knew that they would be allowed in the Temple, but could not partake of the most important ordinances in them. Yet, they still sacrificed to build it. Seeing the exceeding faith of these Mulatto Saints, the General Authorities of the Chuch, who are called &quot;The Brethren&quot;, prayed for months that the Priesthood-ban be finally lifted. On June 1st, 1978, in the Holy of Holies in the Salt Lake Temple, the LORD communicated to President Spencer W. Kimball that He would lift the Priesthood-ban from off the Hamitic lineage. The vast great majority of Mormons were overjoyed at the news. Only a few weeks later, the first black men of African lineage since Elijah Abel and his descendants were ordained to the Priesthood, and they and their families soon thereafter received the Higher Ordinances of the Temple. <br>
This Priesthood-ban has been refered to by Mormons as: <br>
<br>
The Curse of Cain (the son of Adam) <br>
The Curse of Egyptus (the wife of Ham) <br>
The Curse of Pharoah (the righteous son of Ham and Egyptus and king of Egypt) <br>

Some Members of the Church, both black and white, do not believe that the Curse of Cain was of God. They believe it was a misinterpretation by the Apostles and Presidents of the Church, and that it never should have happened. Some believe that Brigham Young misinterpreted Joseph Smith; when the Prophet instructed missionaries not to give the Priesthood to black slaves; since, in Joseph's day, at least two black freeman held the Priesthood (Elijah Abel and Walker Lewis). They assume that Joseph didn't want black slaves to hold the Priesthood only because they couldn't exercize it; not because they were cursed or the descendants of Cain, but because the Priesthood required that a man be free and able to use it. Others believe that the Church &quot;never really taught&quot; this doctrine, but that it was merely the opinion of some of the Members, or perhaps a few of the Apostles. Yet, a close examination of all the historical data reveals that the Priesthood-ban was based solely upon the Curse of Cain Doctrine, and that it was always presented by Church leaders as a &quot;doctrine of the Church&quot; from the days of Brigham Young. Joseph Smith did consider &quot;Negroes&quot; to be &quot;the sons of Cain&quot;. At least two black men (Elijah Abel and Walker Lewis) were ordained to the Priesthood during his life. Some Mormons assume that Joseph Smith wanted all free blacks to have the Priesthood. Others believe that Elijah Abel and Walker Lewis were exceptions to a 'rule' that Joseph Smith made to the Priesthood-ban for black Africans. The debate continues.<br>
But what is absolutely clear and beyond any educated debate is this: that from the days of Brigham Young to the ending of the ban in 1978, Church presidents and apostles as a whole declared that &quot;Negroes&quot; (black Africans) were the descendants of Cain, and that they were banned from the Priesthood because of their lineage (bloodline). In an Official statement made by The First Presidency in 1951 the Curse of Cain was called a &quot;doctrine of the Church&quot; (Statement of The First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the Negro Question, August 17, 1951). At no time was it ever put forth as mere opinion or speculation.<br>
<br>
Some in the Church believe that the Curse of Cain Doctrine was an invention of Brigham Young, the 2nd President of the Church, and not the Prophet Joseph Smith. Yet, the evidence shows that it probably originated with Joseph Smith. He was the translator of The Book of Abraham; where it says that Pharoah was of Hamitic lineage, which lineage was &quot;blessed with wisdom&quot; but &quot;cursed as pertaining to the Priesthood&quot; (Abraham 1:26). Also, in a debate he had with John C. Bennett, the first Mayor of Nauvoo, on who had the greater cause of complaint against the white man, Indians (native Americans) or Negroes, the Prophet said &quot;that the Indians have greater cause to complain of the treatment of the whites, than the Negroes or sons of Cain.&quot; (History of the Church 4:501)<br>
<br>
Some in the Church believe that Brigham Young and all the Presidents of the Church from his day until Spencer W. Kimball were simply &quot;wrong&quot;. But the reader must understand that this is their own personal opinion. The only one who can speak for the Church officially is The First Presidency, and they have declared, in private and public letters, that the Curse of Cain doctrine was &quot;a doctrine of the Church&quot; and the Priesthood-ban was &quot;a commandment of the LORD&quot;. They have not repudiated it, and, until it is repudiated by The First Presidency, the belief that Negroes (black Africans) are the descendants of Cain through Ham's wife remains an official &quot;doctrine&quot; of the Church; even if it is not actively taught. Until The First Presidency calls the Priesthood-ban a &quot;mistake&quot; then it is not a &quot;mistake&quot;. There is no indication at this time (2001 A.D.) that The First Presidency has any intention of calling the Curse of Cain doctrine &quot;false&quot; or the Priesthood~ban a &quot;mistake&quot;.<br>
<br>
Some in the Church believe that the Curse of Cain legacy should simply be &quot;forgotten&quot;; that &quot;the past is in the past...let's move on!&quot; However, when sincere investigators and others ask about the Curse of Cain legacy (which is all-over the Internet) what are Latter-day Saints to tell them? Thousands upon thousands of black (and some white) investigators (people who are inquiring about the Church) and new converts ask about the Curse of Cain legacy each and every year. Often, missionaries don't know what to say. Often, their bishops (if they are new converts) tell them, &quot;Don't worry about it! Just attend your meetings, pay your tithe, and you're be blessed!&quot; What should Latter-day Saints tell others who ask about the Curse of Cain and Priesthood-ban? Should they say, &quot;That's all in the past, let's move on!&quot;? Should they say, &quot;Well, I don't agree with what the Church did!&quot; Should they say, &quot;Don't worry about it!&quot;? Or, should they simply tell people the truth about the matter, and let the LORD take care of the rest?<br>
<br>
Some Mormons are afraid to tell the truth; not wanting to be thought of as &quot;racists&quot;. So, they avoid speaking about it. When the question is asked, they look at their watches and say, &quot;Gosh, look at the time! I gotta run!&quot; Still others, not knowing the true history, will say, &quot;No, our Church never taught such things!&quot; Then, when black investigators and new converts find out otherwise (and they always do~eventually) they are absolutely devastated; they almost always leave the Church or go totally inactive (not attending Church or participating in the Mormon Faith); NOT because of the Curse of Cain legacy, but because they feel they've been lied to.<br>
<br>
Mormons who accept the Curse of Cain Doctrine, and the resulting Priesthood-ban, as from the LORD also believe that both are now irrelevant; since the Priesthood-ban was lifted in 1978 by the LORD's revelation to President Spencer W. Kimball. But they also believe that the past shouldn't be forgotten; just understood. Since 1978, worthy black males in the Church have been ordained to the Priesthood. One of them, Helvecio Martins of Brazil, who joined the Church before black men could be ordained to the Priesthood, became a General Authority (leaders) in the Church in 1990. He became a Member of the 2nd Quorum of Seventy; which is the 5th highest quorum (council) in the Church.<br>
<br>
Q. But isn't the Curse of Cain doctrine 'racist'?<br>
<br>
A. Under the dictionary definition of 'racism' the Curse of Cain doctrine is not 'racist'. It did not declare that people of Hamitic lineage were 'inferior' to people of other races or lineages. Indeed, it actually said that the Cainites were the founders of the first cities, and the first to work in metal and use musical instruments (Genesis chap. 4). These are not the actions of an &quot;inferior&quot; people. The Curse of Cain Doctrine declared that the ancient Egyptians, who were 'blessed with wisdom' but 'cursed as pertaining to the Priesthood' were really the first to develope math, science, and architecture. Surely, these are not signs of &quot;inferiority&quot;. If anything, the Curse of Cain Doctrine presents the descendants of Cain as SUPERIOR to other races and lineages; at least anciently. Black Africans (whether they are in America, Africa, or any other part of the world) are the descendants of the ancient Nubians; who had the blood of the ancient Egyptians in their veins. They were the descendants of Noah through Ham; as well as the descendants of Cain through Ham's Cainite wife Egyptus. The ancient Egyptians (and Nubians) were a very advanced and cultured people! They had civilization, math, a written language, and sciences, when the Europeans were still living in caves and wearing the skins of animals!<br>
<br>
Yet, the Bible contains many prophecies, like in Ezekiel chapters 29 and 30, that the LORD would scatter the Egyptians among the inhabitants of Pathos (black Africa), and would divide them, and would make of them, in the latter days, slaves of other nations(Ezekiel chap. 30)Some blacks, including many Africans and African-Americans who are not Mormons, see these Biblical prophecies as being fulfilled. Others see these things are totally unrelated, and see any suggestion that they are of Cainite or Hamitic lineage as 'racist' in itself. Those blacks that reject the notion they are the descendants of the ancient Egyptians (via the Nubians) also usually reject the Bible and its prophecies; especially those of Ezekiel where it says that the LORD would &quot;scatter&quot; the Egyptians among the inhabitants of Pathos (black sub-saharan Africa) and He would make of them slaves of &quot;other nations&quot; in the last days. Why? Because their ancestor did not &quot;hearken&quot; (listen to and obey) the Voice of the LORD!<br>
<br>
But wasn't the Priesthood-ban a form of discrimination?<br>
<br>
A. The Priesthood-ban was a form of discrimination! To 'discriminate' means to choose one thing over others. The LORD chose Israel, among all nations, to be His people. His chose one tribe of 13 Israelite tribes, the Levites, to be His Priests anciently. Many people don't realize that in ancient times, only the Levites, or the descendants of Levi, the son of Israel, could be Priests. All other tribes were banned from Priesthood service; including the tribe of Judah, from which came Jesus. This is definitely discrimination, but it was discrimination from the LORD. He has a right to discriminate as He sees fit. We do not. If the Priesthood-ban was from the LORD, then it was His discrimination. We are not to discriminate, but the LORD can discriminate as He sees fit. He very often has.<br>
<br>
Q. Isn't believing that black folks are or were cursed by God a 'racist' belief?<br>
<br>
No. That is not how 'racism' is defined. God alternatively blesses and curses all nations according to how they adhere or reject His Laws and Prophets. The Bible records many curses upon various peoples, for example:<br>
<br>
<br>
The LORD curses all women to bear children in great suffering because the Serpent (Satan) deceived Eve. (Genesis 3:16) <br>
The LORD curses all men to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow because Adam partook of the forbidden fruit. (Genesis 3:17-19) <br>
The LORD curses the Egyptians with plagues because Pharoah refused to let the Israelites go out of Egypt. (Exodus chapters 7-9) <br>
The LORD curses the Moabites and Ammonites because &quot;unto the tenth generation) because they did not provide food and water to the Israelites in the desert wilderness. (Deuteronomy 23:3) <br>
The LORD promises to curse the ISRAELITES, His own chosen people, if they do not adhere to His commandments.(Deuteronomy chapter 2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
The LORD has a history of blessing and cursing nations and lineages according to how they obey or disobey His laws, and according to how they hearken to (listen and obey) or ignore His Voice (which is revealed through His Prophets). These blessings and cursings have absolutely nothing to do with &quot;racism&quot;!<br>
<br>
Racism is a &quot;philosophy of man&quot; that began in the early to mid-19th century that said that some &quot;races&quot; of human beings are &quot;superior&quot; to others. This philosophy was based upon Darwinism; from the belief that some species of animals (and humans) are &quot;more evolved&quot; (higher) than others. The Philophsophy of Racism was never a part of the Bible; nor was it ever a part of the Mormon Faith! What has always been a Bible-doctrine (and always a part of the Mormon Faith) is that God alternatively blesses and curses various nations, kindreds, tongues, and peoples, according to how they hearken to (listen to and obey) His Voice! <br>

Happy reading!  - The one thing you havent taken into consideration is how many people of African descent have joined the church.  If it is such a racist environment, why would they submit themsleves to that.  In my congregation there are 5 families where one or both of the parents are African American.  Nakia, my friend I mentioned is the Primary President (0ver the childrens congregation) <br>
<br>
I think you have a mindset and no amount of evidence to the contrary is going to convince you that we are not a lot of racists.<br>
<br>
You live in Arizona right, find an LDS church, go to a meeting, find an African American and talk to them.  Maybe they can convince you! - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=48.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=48.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=48.topic&start=61&stop=75>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=48.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=48.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.threadControl?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="religiousdebate60574frm2">Debate Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm10">Christianity Discussions (G Rated)<option value="religiousdebate60574frm1">Announcements<option value="religiousdebate60574frm11">Test Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm5">Help Files</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574>religiousdebate</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2>Debate Forum</a> <font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
