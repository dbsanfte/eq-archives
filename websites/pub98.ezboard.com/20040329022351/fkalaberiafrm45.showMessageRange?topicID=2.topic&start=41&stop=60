America's pride and joy... now in ruins.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I thought to myself as I strode without purpose through Times Square. Death seemed to surround me on all sides, from the abandoned cars to the crumbling buildings. Had someone told me when I was growing up in Russia that the great american city of New York would one day turn from life to death I would not have believed it.<br>
<br>
&quot;HAHA...&quot; I smirked slightly to myself. Had I known this then I probably would have cared as much as I did now which was nothing at all. New York was now the perfect place for a dhampire such as myself to wander. Powerful enough to defend herself and able to walk around in day and night. Though of course the smog made day not so bright anymore but still. This was also a place I could walk freely about with my weapons on myself and no one cared. No police with whistles to come up and take everything away from me, not that I would have let them...<br>
<br>
However without life, this city no longer had the fun it had before. Gone were the days I could kill and read about it the following morning and laugh while the police had difficulty finding clues. Now death was how everyone lived, there was no escape. Vampires were no longer a myth and humans knew they had to become one to survive. Just yesterday I had seen a twelve year old girl, a pretty little thing naked as the day she was born and carrying a sign. It had said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>free blood in exchange for siring.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Well I took her back to my place, fed from her slender little neck while I held her dark hair in my hands and nearly killed her but didn't. Instead I had her bathed and dressed to be toyed with later. I can not sire her but young virgin blood is the sweetiest blood of all.<br>
<br>
But now I was bored and looking for some action be it sexual or other. My young sweet blooded toy at home would not serve me in my desires not that she didn't want to but I was not into that stuff. My own history of when I was her age was painful enough and I would not put her through that as well. &quot;Come on... Mother Russia has more fun then this...&quot; I muttered to myself as I leaped up to rest upon a street light that flickered dimly through dusty glass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/31/03 10:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> Cale smiled at Iris's comments.

She'd been a vampire for nearly fifty years, and she still wasn't used to how easily she could cover a vast distance with her own inhuman speed. Apparently... Cale was more firm and confident in his use of the Blood. She glanced back over her shoulder as she continued to follow close on his heels. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I could have sworn I just saw a girl with red hair decked out in leather...

There stood five vampires surounding a large, strong looking black man in a black muscle shirt and black jeans, who was on his hands and knees gasping for breath, almost as if someone had been working him over. They had. Around his waist was a gun belt, with the holsters empty. Cale spoke calmly as he strode up to the man. &quot;Well, Eric, it's been a long time.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man looked up at Cale and then let his eyes drift to Iris. &quot;Did I interupt something, Cale? I'm so sorry.&quot; Eric's tone suggested he was anything but as he stood up.<br>
<br>
Cale only gave a small smile and a chuckle at the mortal's humor. &quot;You did. But no matter. It's an advantage of being a vampire to be able to mix buisness...&quot; At this he bent and took Iris's hand and planted a small kiss on it. &quot;...With pleasure,&quot; Cale finished smoothly as his lips left his companions hand. Then he quickly spun and landed a solid punch to Eric's chest, sending him back into a wall. &quot;You see? I got immense pleasure from that.&quot;<br>
<br>
After spitting up some of his own blood, Eric only offered an obscenity in response, to which Cale sighed and shook his head. &quot;Now is that any way to speak infront of a lady?&quot; Cale asked as his foot connected with Eric's jaw.<br>
<br>
Eric muttered something of which Cale only caught, &quot;...you and your girlfriend!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eric. Is that a nice thing to say?&quot; the vampire responded. &quot;When you say things like that, I get angry, and when vampires like me get angry, humans like you lose their heads.&quot; At this last Cale grabbed the revolver he had found earlier and aimed it at Eric's head, who immediately straightened up at the sight of the weapon, obviously reckognizing it.<br>
<br>
When he finally spoke, Eric spoke quietly. &quot;The person who owns that gun, and it's twin, will find you and reclaim it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you know the man who killed my brother. Too bad you're going to die soon. This is really a magnificent weapon. Of course, as I am sure you know, it's not so much the gun as the bullets.&quot; Cale pulled back the hammer and squeezed the trigger. Once released, the hammer hit with a resounding *click*. Eric was surprised his head remained intact. Cale laughed. &quot;No, I have a far worse fate in mind for you, my friend.&quot; Then turning to a vampire, Cale simply said, &quot;You know what to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Walking away, Cale passed Iris and paused. Turning around he adressed his lackies. &quot;Out of curiosity, which of you called me?&quot; Four of them reckognized the tone in Cale's voice as masked anger and got out of the way, but the fifth did not.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was me, sir,&quot; he said with a smile, thinking he was about to be rewarded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good job,&quot; Cale said turning around. But then faster than the human eye could comprehend, he spun with the gun in hand and pointed it at the vampires head. &quot;But unfortunately, you interupted a dance.&quot; He cocked the hammer, hearing it click as the chamber turned, lining a bullet up. Then he pulled the trigger until the hammer was released and struck the bullet on the firing pin. The gunpowder ignited, sending the bullet and sever gasses out of the barrel, causing a loud explosion as it cleared the barrel. The bullet spiraled until it reached the vamps skull, which ignited the original explosive and then the thermite. The rest was a flash of light no one could look at directly.<br>
<br>
Cale smiled as he looked at the ashes. Then turning to Iris, &quot;Shall we?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwynnethdelioncourt>Gwynneth de Lioncourt</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://animatedgif.net/bulletsballs/flasharrowrt_e0.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/2/03 10:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jasminebecketgriffith.com/boredfairy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> Iris tore her gaze away from the remnants of the carnage, a new respect for Cale obvious in her eyes at having done something so destructive so easily.

She'd smoked when she was a mortal, and it had made her voice a tad deeper so that it sounded more at home in a bedroom than anywhere else. She produced a lighter from seemingly nowhere and flicked the cover of the zippo open, lighting it in the same instant. Fire always had held a morbid fascination for her since she'd been changed... She lit the cancer stick and took a long, blissful drag, making the end glow red in the semi-darkness. She tilted her head back slightly and blew a perfect smoke ring from her full lips.<br>
<br>
She held the cigarette between her fingers, almost making it seem like it belonged there. She gave Cale a smile and pressed a soft kiss to his cheek. &quot;Thanks, hun. So... where to, now?&quot; She took a short drag, inhaling the toxic smoke deeply. She couldn't get cancer from it, so why not have one on occasion? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/2/03 11:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> (you guys sure post quick...)<br>
<br>
From my perch on the flickering street light I witnessed the shooting with mild interest. Such might have been impressive or perhaps frightening even to some a while ago but to me it was nothing. Bullets tearing through flesh as blood sprang free into the air was my every day surroundings as a child growing up in Russia and then when I joined the Germans in World War II. But even so I was not about to go messing around this night with those who had guns for I myself had other needs.<br>
<br>
One of my needs was to satisfy my thirst for blood for I was feeling a little light headed without it. Second I wanted some action be it violent or sexual. In either case I planned on combining all of those desires into one and have myself a little fun. With ease I sprang from the tops of the street lights, one to the next while keeping just in glimpsing sight of the others. It was not completely intentional on my part but ah well, like I really cared who saw me at this point. Tight leather that was open to allow just the right amount of flesh to show without appearing like a complete slut was my attaire though I was quite certain my weapons gave people the right idea. I was not one to be taken lightly and since tonight I was not in a gameful mood, I allowed the world to see what I truely was.<br>
<br>
As I leaped lightly from lamp to lamp, my eyes roamed the streets looking for possible victims and soon my eyes landed upon a young couple sitting on a park bench. The male was clearly vampire for I could smell it but the girl was his toy. She was a pretty little thing and bonded to him so I knew what my course of action would be. The sweet taste of mortal blood mixed with vampire blood was what I wanted and she had it but first I would have to get rid of him. Silently I landed behind them and in the darkness, I stalked them knowing his vampire life was soon to come to an end and I would suck from tender young breast of the girl's till her life would end with the same bloody weapon his was about to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/3/03 1:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> (sorry can't stay in this thread... moving to a slower one)<br>

I sneaked up closer to my victims but just at the last second I saw something out of the corner of my eye. Another possible victim could it be? I just had to find out so I took off quietly in that direction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/5/03 10:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> Cale smelled the ghoul ahead, and he also smelled her master. A lackey of his. He walked straight up to them, just in time to see the girl take off in another direction. &quot;Jason,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm going to need that girl. I have a new recruit that is going to need all his strength for what he's about to do. Down the ways a bit you'll find them.&quot; Cale spoke matter-of-factly, leaving no room for questions. Jason gave only a small look of protest, but that was quelled quickly after looking at his superior.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right away, sir.&quot; He grabbed the ghoul by the wrist and headed in the direction indicated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait.&quot; The single order barked by Cale stopped the underling in his tracks, like a deer that just heard a twig snap. Slowly turning around, Jason feared the worst. Cale drew the revolver and tossed it to him. &quot;Tell him to make sure the rightful owner gets that back, with my apologies.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gwynnethdelioncourt>Gwynneth de Lioncourt</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://animatedgif.net/bulletsballs/flasharrowrt_e0.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/5/03 10:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jasminebecketgriffith.com/boredfairy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> Iris watched it all silently, knowing better than to ask questions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/5/03 10:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silhouettes in Vinyl</span><hr size=1> Cale smiled as he took another drag of his cigarrette. &quot;I humbly apologize for all this buisness stuff, But you see my brother was killed recently, and I think the owner of that gun is responsible.&quot; <br>
