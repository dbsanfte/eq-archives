Their voices drifted up to me as I sat perched in the darkness of a tree across the street and I could tell all of them were mortal. It was amusing to me to see people still trying to deal with this situation, acting normal, playing basketball. Thug talk from a group of boys walking below came to my ears as well and I smirked as I echoed them. &quot;Yo homie yo, that girl at the club waz ta shitz man.&quot;<br>
<br>
My immitation was poor thanks to my russian accent but I did not care, I was only passing the time as I waited for Taylee to come out of that building. She was going to be an interesting companion that was for sure but I wondered how long she was going to stay. Honestly I did not mind if she decided to stay with me for a while, I was beginning to like her. That little bit of fire she could surprise you with as a real turn on. I licked my lips as my nerves caused my right arm to tremble a little, I needed blood and hopefully she came out with a vampire soon.<br>
<br>
The front doors opened and I watched as a group of people came out. I did not see Taylee and was beginning to wander if she was being a bitch and chickened out. But then I saw her come through and begin to walk away with a package in her arms. Ah yes, there she was and as I watched, I noticed someone else push through the people in the front and slowly follow her. &quot;God I love it when a plan comes together.&quot; I smirked as I climbed down from my perch.<br>
<br>
Quickly I moved, heading down a deserted dark alley between two crumbling buildings. I knew I was not to far off from them but I had to stay hidden. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Taylee my dear, keep going down that alley you are on. I'm going to meet you at the end.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I sent the message to her mind as I reached the end of the alley I was in. I had to find a good place to hide and wait for them and I spotted a dumpster that would suit just fine. With a swift step I made my way to it and glanced carefully around. I could see them coming down the other alley nearby and the vampire was not being to obvious for others walked the same alley with them. This was going to be very interesting and I was beginning to delevope an idea.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Well Taylee, I'm ready so here is the deal. Walk into the center of the street and stop there. I will be be waiting and ready to get the vampire and I have decided to follow a less attention attracting approach.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I sent the message into her mind once more. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;You'll just have to see what but I promise you will not be harmed. If I go guns and swords, you might possibly be hurt but in this fashion I have thought up... you won't be hehe. So come along beautiful, Midnight is getting hungry.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

At least the dhampire hadn't left her to deal with whatever was following her alone. The blonde girl listened to the directions she was being given, leading the Vampire farther down the alley.<br>
<br>
As she got to the middle, she stopped making it look like she was checking her precious bundle of supplies, waiting to see what this plan of Rayne's would be. Taylee could feel the vamp closing in and every instinct in her body screamed for the blonde to run, but she fought it, waiting. She didn't totally trust Rayne but figured the girl had no intention of letting the Vamp get to her before the redhead got to him.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#8B4513>(10/21/03 6:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home, sweet bloody home (pt2)</span><hr size=1> I smirked in an almost partial sneer of delight as I watched Taylee lead the vampire out into the open. It was obvious now who her stalker was but the vampire was a female instead of a male. It mattered none to me for blood was blood and I had already sucked a male vampire neck anyway. I was well aware that the vampire was not expecting company or that sharing might be alright so I had thrown out the idea of acting like another vampire who had happened to pass by. But I also knew I could not use my weapons without drawing unnessesary attention  or worse harming Taylee.<br>
<br>
So instead of approaching the vampire without weapons, I slipped out from my hiding place and mingled through the people until I was standing beside Taylee. I slipped my arm around her slender waist as I walked slowly around her, knowing the vampire would get jealous of possible rivals taking her food from her. &quot;My my don't you look just desireable...&quot; I breathed softly against Taylee as I stood behind her and gave her firm butt a good squeaze. To say I was not feeling a little playful was an understatement. &quot;I could so take you home right now and punish you so much... hmmmm...&quot; the tip of my tongue dragged up her neck lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me... but that girl is mine.&quot; a voice from behind us caused me to turn and see the vampire standing there looking like she was about to lash out at me. Her tone was even but I could tell by the look in her eye that she was not pleased with me playing with her food.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't see your fucking name on her anywhere... But I do see myself holding her in my arms, feeding on her sweet blood till the very last drop slides down my throat...&quot; I smirked as I turned away from Taylee to fully face my real dinner. &quot;I just do not see how you will be able to stop me, go find your own food.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah but I have, you stupid bitch. I have been following that girl for a few blocks now. She is indeed mine and you shall have none of her.&quot; the vampire stood a step closer to me, daring me as theft to do something about it. This was all going so very well and I had her right were I wanted her. I could almost see the anticipation dripping from her fangs, the determination in her eye to have Taylee.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I have been following her to for several blocks...&quot; I stepped towards the vampire cautiously, yet with a sway of seduction in my hips. &quot;Perhaps an agreement could be reached, a share in our find? This girl can't get away from us and there is more then enough blood for us both. Do you really want to be here fighting over who gets here as dawn approaches? We both know that more humans will be out then, hunters as well and we will be easy targets...&quot; I suggested to sway her mind as I stood but a foot away. &quot;It would be so... easy...&quot;<br>
<br>
The trick worked so well, taking me by surprise as well for since I had no weapons on me, the vampire lowered her defenses and took me up on my offer. Her back turned to me as she walked past me towards Taylee and in that instant I was upon her. My arms snaked around her upper body, my hands gripping her breasts through her clothes as I sank my teeth into her neck. I wrapped my legs around her legs to prevent her from trying to run, her arms trapped at her sides from my own arms around her. The sweet powerful vampire blood flowed into my mouth as she struggled and gave an ear splitting scream towards the dark sky above us.<br>
<br>
I drank hard and deeply until she sank to her knees on the ground. I held her in my arms as I crouched behind her though soon I laid her down and bent over her all the while constantly feeding. Finally I was finished as she lay there pale and shaking on the ground before me as I lifted my mouth from her neck and hissed a bloodly breath into the air. &quot;I wish you could live long enough to learn this lesson that trusting others is foolish when it comes to food...&quot; I looked down at her as her own blood dripped from my lips and onto hers. &quot;But... you won't...&quot;<br>
<br>
Softly I kissed her, removing the blood from her lips before pulling away and quickly snapping her neck in my hands. I stood up quickly in a blurred motion as the effects of her blood took over me and setting my senses on fire. Vampire blood could produce a high in my system I really enjoyed and I felt on top of the world. My weapons were safely back in my posession before I rejoined Taylee and I wondered what she would think. Probably that I was no better then the ones I fed from but I did not give a fuck. If they hated who I was, how I came do be this way then they needed to hate the one that made me. &quot;Lets go... my place is not to far from here now...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

But a little huff of protest escaped her lips as the other girl's hand wandered down to squeeze her butt. At the girl's next words, as her tongue slid down the blond's neck, Taylee couldn't keep the illicit images out of her mind, even though she wasn't into other women.<br>
<br>
A slight smirk touched Taylee's mouth as she heard the Vampire behind them claiming ownership, knowing that she had just played into Rayne's game. The blond stood impassively listening as the redhead offered the Vamp a deal, and Taylee hoped that it was part of the plan....but then Rayne didn't seem like the sharing kind of girl.<br>
<br>
As the vampire girl stepped forward, so intent on her meal that she didn't notice that Taylee wasn't even trying to get away, or for that matter didn't really seem scared, Rayne grabbed her, sinking her own fangs into the girl. Taylee turned at the girl's scream, to watch the struggle that could very easily have been her own. No emotion showed across her face as they sank to the ground, and Rayne finished her off. How could she feel sorry for a creature that would have done the same to her.<br>
<br>
A pang of alarm ran through Taylee as Rayne disappeared, but before she could wonder if the girl was going to leave her out on the street alone, she was back rearmed with her now familiar weapons. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Lets go... my place is not to far from here now...&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she heard the dhampire say, and with a shrug, followed Rayne.<br>

It was also with great pleasure that I thought back to how well that whole scheme of mine had gone and how easy it had been. Maybe for the thrill, I would try that again or different more dangerious ways of feeding and slaying. Killing period was a thrill for me but the more dangerous the better.<br>
<br>
Through the streets I lead Taylee, my mind having second thoughts as to why I was taking her into my home. Well my home was an interesting place and would not be safe for her if she tried to bring me harm. I had a few valued and powerful friends, vampires and mortals who hired me to do their dirty work and as long as I got what I wanted, I never thought of taking them out. My home was their home, a frequent stop for blood, sex and money for I ran a very questionable club if you will. Feeding, physical activities all took place out in the open like a big open house orgy though I hardly ever joined. I was the mistress of the place and took who I wanted to my private quarters.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well this is it.&quot; I spoke as I came to a stop before a large club that by the outward appearance looked abandoned. I lived on the top floor while the club took up the first two floors. All was quiet and as it should be for it was pretty much dawn and everyone had gone home. I just wanted to get some rest myself so the fact I missed the party was none of my concern. Once more I slipped my arm around Taylee's waist and lead her up the steps and inside were we paused in the middle of the huge dance floor. All around the dance floor were tables, couchs and serving bars. The second floor was a balconey, the more VIP area were most of the action took place. Broken bottles littered the floor and over in the dark corner I could see a few of the guys cleaning up. &quot;I'll be upstairs guys, I expect to see this place spotless by the time I come back down.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes miss Rayne, no prob.&quot; they mimiced eachother, knowing that if they disapointed me then not only would they lose pay but some blood or their life if I was so inclined. But right now I just wanted my home clean and I noticed the second floor was not any better as I lead Taylee up the flight of stairs. &quot;This floor to, its even worse ok?&quot; I instructed them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now Taylee... come with me and we will go to my private quarters. There is running water, a kitchen and bathroom if you like. Since I hardly have guests who do not sleep in my bed, I really don't have much to offer you other then a couch.&quot; I informed my lovely guest as I pulled her by the waist towards another flight of stairs. &quot;I am sure your tired and hungry so make yourself at home and get some rest.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

She knew what kind of place this was. Anyone associated with Vamps did......but she was surprised that someone like Rayne that professed to hate the Vampire race would call this home.<br>
<br>
Still, she let the dhampire, holding her by the waist, lead her through the club and up into her private domain. Taylee had listened passively as Rayne had talked to her employee's, telling them what she wanted done, not worrying what they might think of her being with their mistress. Right now she was too tired to care.<br>
<br>
Taylee barely heard her, as Rayne talked, until she mentioned,<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;There is running water, a kitchen and bathroom...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and the girl just shrugged when Rayne said, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Since I hardly have guests who do not sleep in my bed, I really don't have much to offer you other then a couch.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;That'll be fine,&quot; Taylee answered when Rayne had finished. <br>
<br>
When they stepped inside, Taylee let a tired sigh escape her lips and put the bag down. Turning to her hostess, she said &quot;If you don't mind, I'd really like a shower.&quot; She shrugged the coat from her shoulders, and when she received a nod from the other girl, smiled at her before wandering towards the hallway.<br>
<br>
Taylee let the hot spray flow over her skin, enjoying a seldom found luxury. As she reached for the shampoo, she laughed. The redhead really did have the good stuff. A groan escaped the blonde girl's lips as she lathered herself all over and let the dirt slip away.<br>
<br>
When she was done, Taylee dried off, and pulled on her underwear and tank. Her pants were still wet from the rain, earlier and so she decided to let them dry before wearing them again.<br>
<br>
Padding out of the bathroom in bare feet, Taylee grabbed the bag and moved into the kitchen. After she'd eaten, she couldn't help the large yawn, and not seeing Rayne, decided to get some sleep. <br>
<br>
Taylee fell into sleep almost as soon as she lay down, but as the day wore on she became restless...tossing and turning on the couch.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#8B4513>(11/13/03 10:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home, sweet bloody home (pt2)</span><hr size=1> I left my beautiful guest to herself, allowing her to shower and eat in private while I attended to some business. Having missed most of the action my club usually brought since I was gone, I had to find out the details. So I wasted the next few hours over a drink while chatting with one of my trusted bar maids, discussing the events of the night. She was my personal doctor as well so we slipped into my room for an examination.<br>
<br>
A few hours later, I crawled out if the arms of my female companion Carla and stood beside the bed. Her naked slender form teased my eyes for more lustful actions but I had matters to attent do. With a kiss on her forehead and a pass of my hand through her dark hair, I left her and made my way naked into the rest of my home. I found a pair of jeans and a simple tight black turtle neck to wear so I put those on and made my way into the living room that Taylee was sleeping in. Already aroused somewhat by my sexy doctor Carla, the sight of Taylee in her panties and tank top did the rest. Resisting the urge to pounce on her and take what called to me, I muttered under my breath a curse at her teasing.<br>
<br>
Promises were not ment to be broken but they did have a way of coming back and biting me in the ass and the one I made Taylee was no exception. That still did not stop me from taking a good look at her before going into my kitchen and making myself a bite to eat. But Taylee's restless behavour on the couch caused me to return to her and I sat down against the wall near her and watched. She tossed and turned side to side yet remained asleep and I began to wonder what was troubling her. She was safe now with me for though I sure wanted a piece and some blood, I did keep my word. But she still seemed to have something troubling her and I could only watch and hope she thought something I could read and understand. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thealleykat>The Alley Kat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8B4513>(11/16/03 9:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dreamangel101.homestead.com/files/sash.jpg width=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home, sweet bloody home (pt2)</span><hr size=1> Water cascaded down the muscles of her back, sliding along the curvature of her hips. It was all smooth and yet solid, not out of choice but neccecity in order to survive. Scars tainted the perfect curvature of her body some more prominant than others. Her long black hair hung, damp, trailing past her waist. She droppped the bucket, watching it roll to the other side of the room. Running water was something she didn't have and did without. <br>
<br>
The Clock tower looked to be falling appart on the outside, but the inside, on the three floors up at the top, they were fully furnished due to so called 'treasure huting'. <br>
<br>
She stepped out into the long hallway, torn satin drapes blocked out most of the sunlight, yet still a sliver peeked through, cutting into the darkness. Light spilled onto her as she tightened the ponytail and fixed the collar of her leather jacket. Sashiko had awakened. Her boots made loud noises as she walked down the hall. The slight thumping in her joints meant she was hungry...starved even. Walking past a rusted suit of armor she took the bull whip from its hands, looping it through her belt as she walked. <br>
<br>
Putting on mirrored shades as soon as she hit the street Sashiko's nose twitched. There were warm bodies about in the sunlight. And so she walked, passing the prostitues that stood on the corner, hoping for an early start. Of course she couldn't help but eye them as she passed, seeing what she'd be missing. Sashiko was in no mood to pay today, what a shame.<br>
<br>
She walked, passing a bar she normally would have ignored and walked on past. But this morning she stopped. The wind sifted through her damp hair as she stood there in silence, starting at the front door. There were people inside. And perhaps breakfast. A smile pulled at the right side of her lips. Sashiko pushed open the front door and stepped inside. It was mostly empty except for a few patrons. Just what she had expected. Stalking over toward the bar she kept the glasses on. <br>
<br>
&quot;Water.&quot; she said in a soft voice as she slid onto the bar stool <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

I would not wake her but instead let her get that well needed rest her body craved. I knew once that vampire blood inside her had been washed from her veins, Cale would no longer be able to find her. But if he did I would be waiting with my weapons to cut off his fucking head and drink his blood.<br>
<br>
As Taylee rolled onto her stomach, I knew I was coming very close to breaking my promise to her for she was so innocent. I had to get a drink to clear my head and I knew when Taylee woke, there would not be any other way for her to get out then past me anyway. Not that I thought she'd want to leave but mortals were so weird at the best of times you just never knew. &quot;Sweet dreams my lovely...&quot; I whispered with a slight sneer on my lips. &quot;If Cale does find you... I'll fuck him over so badly he'll wish his great ancesters never fucked so he wouldn't have been born to die so painfully.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that I took leave of Taylee and made my way down onto the second floor of my bar. There was hardly anyone there save for what left of the staff that were cleaning up and the odd drinker that never went home. But there was something else, something very distinct and different from what usually were my mornings. I could smell something very familer, something that had pissed me off greatly earlier. It was the same smell that had filled my nostrals just before I blacked out while being raped... the unnoticed stench of a were creature. Mortals could never smell this scent, but vampires, dhampires and other weres could tell who was not quite right.<br>
<br>
And there she was, taking a seat at MY bar and asking for water. I was becoming furious at how bold this were was but I began to realise that she might just be a little different. She was a dark haired pretty little thing and besides I had been raped by male weres that she might not have known. And since my hatred for were creatures happened to be directed at the male ones, I decided to let her be. But that did not mean I was going to leave her alone completely.<br>
<br>
My black leather pant legs brushed eachother as I stepped up behind her to stop a short distance beside her. The bar tender behind the counter knew better then to address me as the owner and slid me a beer at my request. He looked away quickly as I gave him a glare when I caught his eyes looking at the tops of my breasts which poked out of the low neck of my halter top. &quot;Not to many people order a water... not unless they are trying to get some attention...&quot; I spoke to the dark haired girl in the leather jacket as I tied my red hair back.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thealleykat>The Alley Kat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#8B4513>(11/20/03 10:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dreamangel101.homestead.com/files/sash.jpg width=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home, sweet bloody home (pt2)</span><hr size=1> She gave a morning yawn, one of those lazy cat ones. Sash played it like she was oblivious to what went on about her, raising her arms for a streatch before the bar tender slid her water across the bar to her waiting hand. The look her gave her when she asked for the drink was one of disbelief. He more than likely thought she was joking, perhaps being sarcastic. He'd stared at her until he finally realized what was what she really wanted.<br>
<br>
There weren't many in here. Which was what Sash wanted, she just needed someone to pick off of. If she couldn't find anyone attractive then she'd feed the beast instead. But that often ended in a mess. Right now her hunger was somewhat dormant, lightly bubbling beneath her skin. She could hold it back for a little while longer. <br>
<br>
Bringing the glass to her lips she heard footsteps coming closer. They were light yet still loud. Sash was assuming a woman, a fit woman at that. She continued to drink as if she wasn't hearing her, but all the while awaiting her to reach the bar. Finally getting enough to drink she set the glass on the table, wiping away the moisture on her lips.<br>
<br>
Sash heard her speak, keeping her eyes focused on the water in front of her. The woman had a nice voice, and might even have a nice face to go with it. But from the way the words fell from her lips Sashiko could tell that this woman had opinions. And people who didn't were much easier to feed from because they didn't have back bones, and they couldn't say no. <br>
<br>
Sashiko finally turned to see a flawless face and a nice pair of...'eyes' so very close to her. She blinked and then spoke. &quot;Is getting attention a crime?&quot; Her nose twitched as she took the woman's scent in. It reminded her of snakes gathering in an inclosed space. Vampire? My who would have guessed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

Looking around the room with the one eye that wasn't smushed in to the couch, she finally recoginized her surroundings from earlier this morning. Pulling her arms out from under her body, she pushed herself up into a sitting position.<br>
<br>
A heavy sigh tumbled through Taylee's lips, and she raked a hand through her long hair as she realized how quiet the apartment was. 'Rayne must either still be sleeping or out,' she thought, a hint of relief running through herat not having to face the dhampire just yet.<br>
<br>
Getting up, she made her way to the bathroom and retrieved the rest of her now dry clothes, pulling them on quickly, then caught a glimpse of her reflection in the mirror and stopped dead still, staring at the girl she hardly recoginized as herself.<br>
<br>
Taylee lifted a shaky hand, tracing the reflection. She couldn't hide the sadness from herself, and as tears clouded her eyes the image became blurry. Turning away, she slid to the floor, pulling her knees up, laying her cheek down on them.<br>
<br>
Taylee cried, feeling sorry for herself, something she seldom allowed herself to do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#8B4513>(11/23/03 1:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home, sweet bloody home (pt2)</span><hr size=1> The bathroom door opened slowly as a slender girl tiptoed inside. Her long bare slender legs showed from under the long t-shirt she wore and it was clear there was not anything on under it. Her long dark hair framed her face and hung low as she knelt down beside Taylee and spoke comfortingly to her. &quot;Awww Taylee... dry your tears for what has happened in your past can not catch up with you here. You are safe here and there could be nothing better.&quot; the girl wrapped her arms around Taylee as she leaned close.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not know what is troubling you but I have been with Midnight for long time and have managed to figure out her moods... and she is one to say very little... I can tell something is really bothering you.&quot; she whispered softly. &quot;I am Carla... Midnight's doctor, you have nothing to fear from me. Or from her for I have never seen her bring anyone home with her like she has you. Dry your tears my dear and tell me what troubles you...&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>......... Meanwhile down stairs at the bar .........</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
My eyebrow raised with slight interest at the were's statement. It attention was what this dark haired beauty wanted, then she had picked the wrong place for the kind she sought. &quot;Attention? Now asking for water as a means for getting attention in an almost dead bar at nine am in the morning seems a bit odd.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And...&quot; I leaned very close and breathed into her ear as I whispered. &quot;There are no vampires here... only something that is much more powerful...&quot; A smirk crossed my red lips as I leaned back and took a sip of the red blood wine that had been set before me. I had heard her vampire thought in her head but I was a dhampire. But what did I really expect from a were? Much less then I had since my encounter with them in the sewers. &quot;So what really brings you here? Some breakfast perhaps?&quot; I snapped my finger at the bar tender. &quot;Some breakfast perhaps for us both barkeep, but no water for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
My dark eyes roamed over the girl curiously for in my home of hunters, mortals and vampires who all came to forget the troubles of the world, I had never felt the presense of a were here. Apparently they were starting to populate more, must be from their men raping as many women as they could. Who else would want to sleep with someone with a huge sticky smelly cock anyway?

Why did everyone have to keep touching her. 'Couldn't a girl indulge in a little self pity once in awhile without everyone finding out,' Taylee thought feeling a bit stupid at being caught. She'd thought she was alone or she never would have let it happen.<br>
<br>
As the girl, Carla sat beside her, Taylee relaxed a bit, swiping away the remaining tears on her face, and listened to what the girl was saying.

And as for what's troubling me.....&quot; A mirthless laugh escaped her lips, &quot;just take a look out there.

Sashiko was enjoying the little talk this woman was giving her, that and the fact that she liked her scent. It  was sweet, unlike most vampires. She continued to drink her water, letting the cool liquid slide down her throat. Every once in a while she nodded to show the woman that she was in deed lisening to her. And then she leaned in.<br>
<br>
It made Sashiko's skin jump, the feel of her warm breath pushing against her. And her words rose many a questions. More powerful than a vampire? She scoffed inwardly. Being who she was she immediatly she thought a were of some kind. But her scent was all wrong. Then what else? Nothing but silence fell from her lips. She'd let this woman talk all she wanted. <br>
<br>
The woman snapped her fingers and ordered dinner as if she owned the place. Sashiko's brow rose. Was the owner herself talking to her? No, she couldn't let herself jump to conclusions just yet. But it did sadden her almost that this woman was offering to feed her yet in all the wrong ways.  Her eyes finally stared into the woman's.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I must be doing something right ordering water for attention, since here you are next to me.&quot; she said calmly, setting the water down.

Sure she may want your blood but she won't take it. Trust me she soo could without your consent and there would be nothing you could do but enjoy it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Carla brushed her hand through her long dark hair, her searching eyes looking at Taylee intently. &quot;And sure... sure the world out there is pretty fucked up but so what? Roll with whats given you. Midnight told me about you being a ghoul who's master probably wants you dead. But trust me... by tomorrow that ghoul blood will be all out of your system and he won't be able to find you. And should he... well Midnight will see that he leaves you alone... I have seen her take out some pretty powerful vampires and if this Cale could not follow you through the sewers like she was able to... then I doubt he knows his ass from a hole in the wall...&quot;<br>

&quot;Hmmmm...&quot; I let a soft rumble roll out of my throat and between my red lips as I watched her. She was a bold one to show those fangs and I did not have to read her mind to know what exactly she might have really come here for. Slowly I leaned forward, my lips coming teasingly close to hers as my eyes looked down at her neck. My tongue slipped between my lips and touched her fangs ever so softly as I breathed warmly. &quot;I'm beginning to suspect that I do not need to read your mind in order to understand exactly what brought you here...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Isn't it all the same? Wonderful... hot passionate... sex...&quot; I slowly spoke those words, emphasising each one with my russian accent. &quot;And not to mention the... blood... so sweet...&quot; I slowly pulled back from her and licked my lips.<br>
<br>
I kept my appearance as sugar coated as possible without going overboard for I had to be cautious. It was not just any day a were girl walked in looking for sex and blood. It could be a coincidence or a set up and I was going to find out before I allowed her to get to close. But she was an attractive woman and who was I to deny a girl of some good fucking? But no one came near my neck. It was out of bounds for even Carla who was mortal. And unless the person enjoyed a little pain, my bite as not an orgasm either but this Sashiko did not need to know that yet. Instead I would continue to tease her and see what information leaked out of that horny little mind of hers.

Sashiko squeezed the bar until her knuckles grew white. Was this an invitation? She asked herself knowing that if it was it was still dangerous. If she wasn't a vampire, she was something close to it. But she was so tempting...<br>
<br>
A sweat bead rolled off her forehead, sliding down her chek. There was no hiding the fact that that was exactly what she wanted. Sex, hot and unbridled, untamed. But this woman didn't know what sex meant with her. She needed it like air at times and right now she was starving.  It was either that or kill someone and right now she wanted fuck this woman insteadof killing her. And there was also the fact that having sex with her would probably be easier than killing her.<br>
<br>
She turned to her again, and slipped out of her jacket, T-shirt sight across her bosom. &quot;It is wonderful. Sex that is. But most partners tend to be timid when they find out the things I can do.&quot; Sashiko's blue eyes never left the woman, her breasts seeming even more enticing by the minute. Could she hear her heart beating for where she stood?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

'Yeah,' she thought, 'ruthless agression and contempt for life....that fit the redhead.' No she didn't think she had Rayne confused with someone else, maybe this girl was just naive where the dhampire was concerned.<br>
<br>
Then as Carla continued, she listened silently until the other girl was done. &quot;Well, I may not know that much about Rayne...but it seems she had no problem telling you about my life.&quot; Taylee stood up to put a bit of distance between herself and the girl still on the floor, &quot;Only one thing...Cale is not my master.....My master doesn't want me dead...he's the one that's dead..&quot; her voice grew distant at the end, &quot;...and gone.&quot;<br>
<br>
'Damn these people for meddling in things that they knew nothing about,' Taylee thought as she paced to the other end of the bathroom, before turning to look back at Carla. What did this obviously well taken care of girl know about rolling with what was given you? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#8B4513>(12/7/03 1:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home, sweet bloody home (pt2)</span><hr size=1> &quot;Well... I can see your troubled by something but I can help you.&quot; Carla spoke softly as she watched Taylee pace back and forth in the small bathroom. It was obvious something was bothering her but Carla did not know just what. &quot;And geez I thought Midnight was a hard bitch to crack... Even though I am close to her, there is very little I know about her. But that does not stop me from caring and I want to help you to. Please don't assume I have no idea about the real world out there... thanks to Midnight I have had more then an overdose of it.&quot; the dark haired girl looked down at her bare feet before slowly turning towards the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can I make you some breakfast at least?&quot; she looked back over her shoulder at Taylee. &quot;It might make you feel better, or at least full.&quot;<br>

My eyes delighted in the sight of her tight t-shirt making her breasts very appealing and even through I had spent the night with my bed nurse Carla, I was up for some more excitement. It was also clear that everything I was doing to test this Were was all coming into place very nicely for she was responding perfectly. Her deep desires that could be felt in the air came into my thoughts as I read her mind for a peek at what was going on inside her head. Her hunger... her need for sexual satisfaction was very strong and I smiled seductivly at her as I placed my hand on her arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well now... timid partners are indeed no fun... But I am the opposite... everything in my life is an extreme... I doubt you could frighten me off with the things that you could do.&quot; I kept my eyes locked onto hers as I picked one of the beer nuts out of the dish and popped one into my mouth before licking my finger tip. &quot;I'd wonder... are you challenging me to see how much I could take?&quot; I raised an eyebrow at her as my smirk revealed a fang. This was starting to get very interesting and I always enjoyed a good fuck from the enemy. Besides this dark haired beauty was trying to work her magic on me and like the horny bitch I was, I was letting it take effect. Besides I was safe in my club and no harm that I did not want would come to me. My eyes drifted from her breasts, past her eyes and over towards the back of the bar where I eyed the door to a private room back there.<br>
<br>
As I leaned back and slid my hand across her arm, my leather halter top opened slightly to reveal more of myself to her. It was becoming a test to see just how long she could hold out before going nuts as I teased her hunger as much as I could. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Come on my dear were... show me what you got.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I sent a thought into her head to see if she thought it was her own mind or mine that spoke to her.<br>

I'm sure your life hasn't been all roses either..&quot; and then under her breath Taylee added, &quot;...especially living around someone like Rayne.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
The door to the back room opened as Raine slipped out, the only clothes on her body were the leather pants that she wore. Her skin was covered in sweat, the moisture clinging to her as she appeared a little flush. A satisfied smirk danced on her lips, her dark eyes flashing at her employees who smiled back. They all knew she had taken care of that sexual edge that plagued her all morning that that the lovely temptress she had taken in the back room was still there and probably sleeping. Raine did not have a habit of killing her partners, only taking them to the erotic extreme their bodies could handle before leaving them passed out on the bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;When she comes around, make sure she gets something to eat...&quot; Raine ordered her bartender as she passed by. &quot;Also see that no one bothers her, I kind of like this one and would like to keep her around.&quot;<br>
<br>
With lush bouncing breasts, Raine stepped lightly up the stairs towards her quarters were she had left Carla and Taylea earlier. Droplets of sweat ran down her slender back from her damp red hair, a certain scent of sexual passion a strong aroma on her form. The door creaked softly as Raine slipped into her quarters and headed to her bedroom past the bathroom were Taylea and Carla sat. Once there she picked up a towel and wiped herself down. What she really wanted was a good hot shower and so she picked up some clean clothes and with the towel in hand, walked towards the bathroom. She knew the others had to be in there because no one had seen them leave and she had not noticed them in the kitchen or her bedroom.<br>
<br>
&quot;My life is fine with Raine... Sure the world is fucked up, thats what made Raine who she is... she only came to be this way to survive... and sure yes she takes things to far at times but I know that deep down she is a strong loyal friend and keeps those she loves very safe. You'll be fine here...&quot; Carla spoke as Taylea approached her as she stood by the bathroom door. &quot;I'll fry you some breakfast.&quot; she opened the door to find Raine standing there topless.<br>
<br>
&quot;OH!&quot; Carla explaimed in surprise as Raine stood there with a smirk. &quot;I... didn't know you were there...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wasn't until just now, but if you'll excuse me, I need a shower. Fix our guest some breakfast will you? And a little extra also because I could use some more myself.&quot; Raine spoke simply as she brushed past Carla and planted a kiss in the brunette's fair cheek before standing before Taylea. &quot;Carla makes the best eggs, bacon and toast... I'll be out in a while.&quot; she spoke to Taylea before pushing them both out of the door and closing it behind them, leaving them both outside the bathroom. Carla had a smirk on her face as she lead Taylea towards the kitchen. &quot;Seems like someone got a little morning action... Raine is like that, you'll get used to it. Guess being part mortal and part vampire fucks you up eh?&quot;<br>
