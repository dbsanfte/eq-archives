<br>
I am hereby officially tendering my resignation as an adult. I have decided I would like to accept the responsibilities of an 8 year-old again. <br>
<br>
I want to go to McDonald's and think that it's a four star restaurant. <br>
<br>
I want to sail sticks across a fresh mud puddle and make a sidewalk with rocks. <br>
<br>
I want to think M&amp;Ms are better than money because you can eat them. I want to lie under a big oak tree and run a lemonade stand with my friends on a hot summer's day. <br>
<br>
I want to return to a time when life was simple, when all you knew were colors, multiplication tables, and nursery rhymes, but that didn't bother you, because you didn't know what you didn't know and you didn't care. All you knew was to be happy because you were blissfully unaware of all the things that should make you worried or upset. <br>
<br>
I want to think the world is fair.  That everyone is honest and good. <br>
<br>
I want to believe that anything is possible. I want to be oblivious to the complexities of life and be overly excited by the little things again. <br>
<br>
I want to live simple again. <br>
<br>
I don't want my day to consist of computer crashes, mountains of paperwork, depressing news, how to survive more days in the month than there is money in the bank, doctor bills, gossip, illness, and loss of loved ones. <br>
<br>
I want to believe in the power of smiles, hugs, a kind word, truth, justice, peace, dreams, the imagination, mankind, and making angels in the snow. <br>
<br>
So . . . here's my checkbook and my car keys, my credit card bills and my 401K statements. I am officially resigning from adulthood. <br>
<br>
And if you want to discuss this further, you'll have to catch me first, cause........ <br>
<br>
......&quot;Tag! You're it.&quot; <br>

<br>
when out TV broke, we didnt have one for another year or so...i got older sisters clothes..all that kind of thing.<br>
<br>
when i got older and made money of my own and moved..i had some things then...couch, chairs, stereo, tv, car payment...all that kind of thing.<br>
<br>
the apartment i was living in caught fire and burned down. just about everything i had was lost. and after i got over it...i actually felt free. i had always wanted to dance and perform and work with native american groups and people...and teach non natives about the culture. but there was never much money in it. <br>
<br>
so after the fire and felt that freedom, i realized the happiest, most content and at peace was when i had been was when i was young. of course some of that comes from being young...but also all the running we do to pay for all our stuff.<br>
<br>
so i found i no longer had to work all day to pay for it all. i sold my car and bought one with insurance money from all my stuff....and started to do what i really wanted to do....i wanted to work and thought God would take of the rest.<br>
<br>
i have a little daughter and we started traveling around...spent time back home in wyoming...went to other reservations...i did performing. i make enough to keep us fed and clean and healthy. sometimes i lease a place for a while...but i dont have much stuff to cart around...i stayed on a reservation for about 6 months to work and help there...someone let me use a small house.<br>
<br>
we ended up in delaware of all places after i was performing along the east coast in a native style contemporary band. i was living in rented trailor and then traveling from there..and my daughter was with me all the time. some of my family wanted me to leave her back home and i thought about it, but i couldnt do it. <br>
<br>
so while in philly i met a woman and became friends. shes british and was in the USA for the summer last year. i told her she could stay in my trailor if she needed to..we werent there alot of the time. she said she wanted to stay in the area around philly...but she leased a house on the beach in delaware...and asked me and my daughter to live there. she also travels and isnt there alot of the time. she hasnt been here for months recently. <br>
<br>
i stayed so my daughter could be in one school for a whole year now that shes at that age. and the women wont take any money from me. so now i'm living in a palace! we have the whole second floor...3 rooms and 2 baths..the kitchen is on the 3rd floor...the womans room is also on that floor. there is a deck that goes around the whole building and you can see and hear the ocean from there. <br>
<br>
so now...we have everything...and in a way we have nothing. and we are more happy then when i worked all day to pay for all our stuff. the house is leased for another year and we're welcome to stay. <br>
<br>
i work but not all the time. i work at a greenhouse and at a local small horse stable sometimes. we dont have much money but we live in a palace!<br>
<br>
and we play tag alot on the beach. during the time i used to be working and running around worrying. <br>
<br>
that fire that seemd like a terrible thing at the time was really one of the best things that happened to us. (we werent in the apartment when it happened...i drove home to the fire trucks in the street and the fire almost out) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heartjoys>heartjoys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Velvet-Steel Wannabe</span><br>  Posts: 515<br> <font color=#B87333>(6/16/03 9:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.celticisledesign.co.uk/cushionround.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: re</span><hr size=1> Wow Wihinape....what a story, what an experience, what a testimony!<br>
