1)  Thanks Darkmast for your observation and there will be a feedback thread after this is over so people can give advice for improvements within the debate structure.<br>
<br>
2)  Darkmast's last post was a counterpoint and should have only been 1 paragraph.<br>
<br>
It will remain 'as is' since it was posted several hours ago- Whitetigress' first counterpoint will be allowed to be the same length THIS TIME ;-)<br>

Some things came up, again, and i was unable to post online. *Blush* i am deeply sorry.<br>
<br>
Let us first look at the verses in the Bible that say that baptism is necessary for salvation:Mark 16:16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. <br>
Acts 2:38   Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>
Acts 2:41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls<br>
Acts 22:16    And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.<br>
Galatians 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.<br>
Mark 10: 38-39  But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?<br>
 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:<br>
1 Corinthians12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. <br>
John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. <br>
Peter 3:21The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:<br>
Romans 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. <br>
<br>
All these verses make it clear that Baptism is necessary for salvation.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkmast03>darkmast03</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;> <b>The Dark Knight and <br>Torchbearer of the<br> Tournaments!</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#B87333>(10/30/03 4:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative Case #1</span><hr size=1> How do you reconcile these verses with the Scripture I cited that showed people being indwelt by the Holy Spirit before baptism?<br>
<br>
How also do you reconcile these verses with the thief on the cross?<br>
<br>
Would it be a feasible interpretation of your verses that faith saves and baptism is to be the next step?<br>
<br>
Why do you think baptism is left out of so many references to salvation?<br>
<br>
Could you address the Greek meaning of eis, which is found in your Acts 2:38 verse?<br>
<br>
In 1 Peter 3:21, could you reconcile your insinuation that this verse teaches that you are saved by baptism with the next statement (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God)?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry it took so long to post this stuff. This debate is definitely a learning experience and quite the fun one.<br>

Two points to remember - there is no edit function here (other than admin/mod) so be very sure what you post is exactly the way you want it to read.  Also, the format of the post above really isn't in &quot;3 paragraph&quot; or less.  However, it would not have gone beyond the sentence/paragraph limit so I'll allow it to remain.<br>

out of so many verses,&quot; I could do the same and ask, &quot;Why is it in so many verses;&quot; if it weren't necessary, then the word of God would not have said it were necessary at all, even in one place: EVERYTHING in the Bible is TRUE-that does not exclude verses dealing with baptism salvation; secondly, when my 1 Peter verse says, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, it is stating that the baptism it is talking about is not simple washing, not simply being dunked/sprinkled with water: the person has to  mean it, in the same way that, I am sure you would say, a person has to mean the words,<br>
&quot;Lord Jesus, save me, a sinner;&quot;  simply the words themselves are not enough. Nowhere does it state that being indwelt with the Holy Spirit is what causes one to be saved; no, it is not a correct interpretation to assume that these verses are saying that baptism is after the confession of the Lord Jesus Christ because some verses of the Bible also have to do with people being baptised before saying the prayer, and some people saying the prayer before being baptised, perhaps both are required, but they are requirements that can be fulfilled at separate times- everything in the Bible is true, it does not EVER contradict itself, so if it says that you have to believe to be saved in one verse, and then says that you have to believe and be baptised to be saved in another verse, then, assuming the Bible does not contradict itself, you must believe and baptised to be saved- if you only need to believe to be saved, then other verses would not add the &quot;and be baptised;&quot; as far as the thief on the cross, we have no clue when he had died, whether it was before or after Jesus, and we know nothing about whether he ever followed Jesus, heard<br>
of Jesus, or anything else- why would God have left that out, especially if it was the ONLY instance in scripture showing that baptism is not necessary for salvation; eis, greek, means:<br>
into, unto, to, towards, for, among &quot;For&quot; (as used in Acts 2:38 &quot;for the forgiveness...&quot;) could have two meanings; if you saw a poster saying &quot;Jesse James wanted for robbery&quot;, &quot;for&quot; could mean Jesse is wanted so he can commit a robbery, or is wanted because he has committed a robbery; (slightly edited, found at www.crosswalk.com) Crosswalk goes on, after this, to say that the &quot;for&quot; in their example means the latter- I would slightly agree, but ONLY slightly; since there is no context, crosswalk is making an ASSUMPTION that they have no right to make- in order to find out the true meaning of &quot;for&quot; on the sign, they would have to look at other things, do some research, find out if Jesse committed a robbery, and find out if whoever posted the sign wants to commit a robbery- if they found that Jesse had not committed a robbery, then the only thing it could mean is that he is wanted so that he can commit a robbery- so we must do essentially the same thing with the Bible, find out if it ever says anywhere else that baptism is necessary for salvation- I believe I have shown that there is a lot more than one verse in the Bible saying that baptism is necessary for salvation.<br>

The question of the thief on the cross, I believe, is a pivotal one, because, God's nature, Scripture says, is unchanging and if even one person were let into Heaven without baptism, then baptism must not be a requirement. The thief on the cross, we are told, died the same day he saw Jesus. &quot;This day you will be with me...&quot; This stands to reason that the thief was indeed in Heaven with Jesus that same day. Also, whitetigress said something about how the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is not what causes one to be saved. That is simply twisting what I was talking about, if it was in reference to my Scripture verse about the people who were indwelt by the Holy Ghost before baptism. This example shows proof that people can be saved before baptism. None of your verses can show conclusively that baptism is needed for salvation, and since I’m limited on the length, I will highlight a few.<br>
<br>
Mark 16:16- Simply put by a Greek expert, “I rather imagine that this passage is assuming that the person who believes will be baptized. It is only our modern deprecation of baptism that gives us problems here.”<br>
<br>
Acts 2:38- The reason I asked about the meaning of eis in this verse is to clear up a misconception, because eis should be interpreted “because of” rather than “for” according to yet another Greek expert. This does indeed clarify the message of the verse to mean that baptism is something we should do because we are forgiven.<br>
<br>
Romans 6:3-4- “When Paul made reference to believers being ‘baptized into Christ Jesus,’ he used an expression that's identical in construction to a statement in 1 Corinthians 10:2, where he said that the Israelites were &quot;baptized into Moses.&quot;<br>
<br>
And one verse that I am reminded of that directly contradicts this- If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Rom. 10:9-10).<br>
<br>
Also, let’s look at the correlation of between the OT and the NT forgiveness. In the OT, we see that the Israelites are commanded to sacrifice animals. The blood of the animals forgave the sins that were committed. Now, what correlation does baptism have? I see no place where baptism or any correlation thereof is discussed in the OT. Why would God change the prerequisites? The truth is that God actually didn’t change the prerequisites, salvation is still only by the blood of a sacrifice, the perfect Lamb of God; adding anything more detracts from that message and would mean that God changes.<br>
<br>
I’m afraid that’s all the case I had room for (I counted the sentences, so hopefully I’m right on the mark).<br>

If He were truly unchanging, then wouldn't we still have to sacrifice animals? Does everything in the NT have a parallel in the OT? Yes, i totally agree that God requires the blood of the Lamb for salvation, but how does adding baptism to that take away from His sacrifice? Why is it that there are so many verses that say that baptism is necessary for salvation? any one taken by itself is doubtlessly disputable, but when one takes the Bible together as a whole, it is easy to see that it never once says that baptism isn't necessary for salvation, does it?

    Mal 3:6   For I [am] the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. <br>
&quot;Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.&quot; (Hebrews 13:8). When He makes a promise, He keeps it. His attributes are unchanging. Therefore, we can assume that His attribute of not allowing sin in front of Him is also unchanging. No, we wouldn't have to sacrifice animals; Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice that allows us the protection that was offered by sacrificing lambs except for the fact that His sacrifice is eternal.<br>
Quote:Does one verse not mentioning baptism at all actually mean that baptism isn't necessary?<br>
I would ask why there are so many verses that exclude baptism, and I seem to remember showing that most of your verses were either taken out of context or were quoted to mean something different than what the original Greek meant. You must rebutt that to win this debate.<br>

And finally, I must say that this method of debate is extremely self-defeating. There is no way I can answer all of those questions in one paragraph. Also, welcome back whitetigress, I been prayin for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whitetigress2004>whitetigress2004</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;><b>The Poet</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#B87333>(12/16/03 11:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative Case #1</span><hr size=1> As far as the verses your &quot;showing that most of your verses were either taken out of context or were quoted to mean something different than what the original Greek meant&quot;, I simply shrugged those off as other's opinions, and they are, because i can easily pull up people who say the exact opposite of the few verses you used as examples:<br>
&quot;Both remission and forgiveness are the English translation of the single Greek noun aphesis or verb aphiemi. Thus, both forgiveness and remission mean the same thing. The root meaning of these words is to 'send away or dismiss;' eis aphesin hamartion, in Acts 2:38, i.e., submit to the rite in order to be forgiven; Acts 2:38 says to be baptized for (eis) the remission of sins. This Greek word can only mean &quot;for the purpose of;&quot;  Mark 16:16-'Believeth' and 'baptized' are joined by 'and' which grammatically shows Jesus is placing equal importance on belief and baptism, which are conditions to: 'shall be saved.'&quot;<br>
<br>
 We see the story of saul and ananias in the Bible presented as follows: Act 9:1 And Saul... 3 ...came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 5 And he said, who art thou, Lord? and the lord said, I am Jesus... Act 9:6...Lord, what wilt *thou* have me to do? And *the lord said* unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou **must** do. Act 22:12 ...Ananias... 13 ...said unto me, Brother Saul... 16 ...why tarriest thou? arise, and be *baptized*, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
Notice that the Lord (Jesus) told saul that ananias would tell him what he MUST do, and Ananias tells Saul to be baptized. <br>

Thank you for the welcome and the prayers, darkmast :)<br>

In Mark 16:16, can you reconcile your interpretation (using the operator &quot;and&quot; as an argument) with the original Greek text? In your Saul example, can you show me where it says that Saul must be baptized to be saved, and not just where it says what he must do, cuz that could mean he must do that to fulfill another obligation?<br>
