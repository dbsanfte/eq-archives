<br>
I have to say..if anyone is the head of our household, it would be me! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I do all the banking, bill paying etc. DH doesn't have a clue how much money we have!  I am the &quot;traditional&quot; wife as well..I stay at home with the kids (although DH is at home all the time as well)..I do all the housework, cooking, cleaning etc...but I also know that my husband has the utmost respect for me as an equal...all the important descions are made together, as a partnership (which is what I believe marriage is)..if we can't agree to begin with, then we will talk it through.  I don't think I could live with a man who didn't respect me as an equal.<br>
<br>
I also wanted to comment about the &quot;kids out of wedlock&quot; thing...I can't remember who said it, but someone said something along the lines of &quot;everyone would agree that a child is better off being raised by two loving parents than by one&quot;.  While I certainly agree with that statement, I don't think you need to be married to be committed, loving, etc.  The only reason I got married was because my mum felt so strongly about kids being born within marriage (no real reasoning, as she isn't even religious..just a &quot;hang up&quot; she has)..and I wanted my children to have the same name as their dad (less confusion)...but as far as the actual marriage, it is nothing more than a piece of paper to me.  My feelings for my husband didn't change once I married him, I felt exactly the same on the day after my wedding, as I had the day before - if it hadn't been for my mums views, I would probably have just changed my name by deedpoll and left it at that! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

That's submissiveness alright and I dare say for many it goes beyond this so that the woman doesn't speak against her husband, do non-traditional things like bills and work etc.<br>

Too bad he can't trust yours equally. I also trust my husband's judgement, but as we are partners rather than master/servant we discuss and agree upon things using mutual respect for each other's intelligence, judgement and accountability.<br>

Nope--you are 100% correct there's no defending this any more than you have attempted and you are certainly living according to scripture. At least you're consistent, though you never addressed why you don't follow the rest of god's commandments concerning blended materials in clothing, shellfish, etc. And yes---you are absolutely servants...no doubt. <br>

I am appalled and disgusted, but fully recognize and would fight to protect your right to live on your knees with pride. I hope you will someday return the favor to those of us who prefer to stand upright, head held proudly and live with another as equals without having to submit according to another person's mythology/religion/system.<br>

Being the only JW here (even though I know some here know some) I just wanted to post a question for you.<br>
<br>
Scenario...<br>
Two parents are discussing discipline for their child.  The child has broken something that belonged to the father.  Had no monetary value but meant something to the father.  The father wants to spank the child and the mother wants to give the child time out.  Now these two parents have an equal relationship, both have an equal say in EVERY thing in their house.  How do you discipline the child?  Would you do both? Equal punishment so that both opinions are respected?  Or would you do nothing, both opinions respected?  (Also keep in mind the roles can be reversed, the mother's thing got broken or whatever, since this is an equal situation.)<br>
<br>
Scenario...<br>
A married couple go car shopping.  The wife wants to get a minivan, no kids yet but planning on a family.  The husband wants a two seater sports car, the kids won't be for two or three years, plenty of time to trade it in later for the minivan.  How do you respect both people, give equal consideration to each persons wants/needs?  Buy both cars, or buy none?<br>
<br>
I know that I am not thinking these through fully enough, but they just popped into my head.  I am submissive to my husband and sometimes I get upset with the decisions he makes, and I don't NOT make decisions.  I just discuss things with him first.  I would assume all of the people here have to submit in some way or another to there spouse.  It isn't like submissive people grovel or beg to their spouses.  There is still respect involved in the marriage.  If there isn't respect by both parties then some one is being abused and that is not what the submission in my house is like.  My husband likes the fact that I think for myself and I compliment him in many ways with the fact that I am not some wet noodle.  But he is the head of my house and I respect him.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, that is it for now, I think this is my longest post ever.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

ok for those of you who want an answer to DBC question that he thinks he knows the answer to.   Here is an article that I copied on the subject.   I have never studied this out for my self and have never been asked such a stupid question.  But obviously the guy who wrote this article has heard the question a few times and decided to enlighen everyone on the topic.   Hope this helps you all.  I dont intend to do anymore research on this subject cause it really is not important to me at all.  I did find the article helpful and learned something my self.<br>
<br>
The Mosaic prohibitions such as not wearing mixed garments,  not sowing mingled seed, and not gendering your cattle with a diverse kind HAVE A SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE. <br>
In looking at the Old Testament, we must distinguish between the CEREMONIAL and the MORAL law. When you read the word and meditate on these things, you will see the spiritual significance of the ceremonial law, why we don't keep ceremony, and why we do keep moral. CEREMONIAL law consists of  the Old Testament sacrifices, clothing/dietary<br>
requirements, etc.  Webster's 1828 defines ceremonial as--<br>
<br>
CEREMONIAL, a. [See Ceremony.]<br>
1.  Relating to ceremony, or EXTERNAL rite; RITUAL; according to the forms of established rites....It is particularly applied to the forms and rites of the Jewish religion; as the ceremonial law or worship, AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE MORAL AND JUDICIAL LAW.<br>
<br>
CEREMONIAL, n.<br>
1.  OUTWARD form; external rite, or established forms or rites, including all the forms prescribed; a system of rules and ceremonies, enjoined by law or established by custom, whether in religious worship, in social intercourse, or in the courts of princes.<br>
<br>
CEREMONIALLY, adv. According to rites and ceremonies; as a person ceremonially unclean; an act ceremonially unlawful.<br>
<br>
CEREMONIOUS, a.  1. Consisting of outward forms and rites; as the ceremonious part of worship.  [In this sense, ceremonial is now used.]<br>
2. Full of ceremony or solemn forms.<br>
<br>
CEREMONY, n.<br>
1.  Outward rite; EXTERNAL FORM IN RELIGION.<br>
<br>
 A ceremony is outward, symbolic, a figure, a type.  The Old Testament is full of ceremonies (termed &quot;figures&quot; in the book of Hebrews or &quot;works of the law&quot; in Galatians).  The outward rituals (like washings and sacrifices) were imposed on the people until the time of reformation (ref. Hebrews 9).  The reformation is KING JESUS!  Old testament sacrifices only<br>
purified men to the sanctifying of the flesh and had to be repeated over and over again.  BUT the blood of Jesus sanctified your spirit, changed your mind, gave you new sight, King Jesus came down to GET IN YOUR SOUL, IN YOUR MIND.  This is the mystery of God which was kept secret from the<br>
foundation of the world. Christ IN YOU the hope of glory.  <br>
<br>
We don't need nothing external, King Jesus wrapped it all up.  No more ceremonial law.  The time of reformation has come and CHRIST HIMSELF is the END OF THE LAW FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO EVERYONE THAT BELIEVETH (Rom<br>
10:4). I ain't got to kill no birds, goats, sheep, bullocks, lambs,<br>
nothing. The blood of Jesus ushered in the New Testament and we don't need no more ceremony, hallelujah!  In fact, trying to keep the ceremony is an offense to God The ceremonial laws were instituted to give us spiritual types and<br>
pictures.  The New Testament book of Hebrews will bust this idea WIDE OPEN for you.  When you understand this, you will read the word with different eyes.  The Bible is not just a collection of accounts.  There are spiritual realities behind the accounts.  Our awesome Lord uses the physical to demonstrate spiritual realities.  The physical helps our<br>
feeble brains understand the things we cannot see. Here are a FEW examples--<br>
<br>
**The OT blood sacrifices of animals for sins PICTURES the NT sacrifice of Jesus and His blood cleansing sin.  **The physical OT temple PICTURES the NT teaching that WE are the temple of the Holy Ghost.<br>
**The city of Jeruselem is on an hill, true Christians are an city set upon an hill Moses lifted up a brass serpent on a pole (those that looked at it were saved--those who didn't, perished), Jesus on the cross (those that look will live, all else will perish)--see John 3:14<br>

**OT carnal priesthood, the Levites. NT a spiritual priesthood, the believer.<br>

<br>
I could go on and on with this list.  There ain't no way I could<br>
understand these spiritual realities without physical examples that God has given me.  How could I understand the kingdom of God if I didn't know what a king was?  How could I understand spiritual warfare if I didn't know about physical war?  How would I know about taking the kingdom of<br>
heaven by holy violence if I didn't know about waring conquests? Our King in His TENDER care, makes us to understand great eternal realities--this applies only to the people of faith who are seeking Him in the way of holiness.  All else will not understand--they can't.<br>
<br>
The ceremonial laws taught us to make a difference between clean and unclean.  If I did not have this physical reality, how could I understand something invisible, the spiritual?  The Lord was teaching people that there is a difference in things.  Some things are clean some are unclean. Some things are holy some profane.  Ezekiel lets us know we are to discern<br>
between the two.<br>
<br>
For instance, Leviticus 19:19 says don't let &quot;thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.&quot;  What is this saying?  God hates a mixture. Don't mix holy with unholy.  The ceremonial law contains all types of commands and prohibitions concerning food.  But the book of Acts says all animals are now clean and can be<br>
eaten.  Instead of people trying to keep the law (which only dishonours Christ), they need to be finding out what all this means.<br>
<br>
The Old Testament moral law is confirmed, and expounded,  in the New Testament. THE MORAL LAW TRANSCENDS BOTH TESTAMENTS.  It tells us RIGHT AND WRONG conduct and character.  Right and wrong is  defined only by God.<br>
Sin is the transgression of GOD'S LAW.  Right and wrong is not relative, it is not ephemeral and fleeting, it is not based on majority vote--God is the Author of right and wrong.  Right and wrong is found in the moral law of the Bible.  The Bible term for &quot;moral law&quot; would be &quot;the law of God&quot;.   <br>
<br>
The moral law...It is good and right to worship God ALONE.  It is wrong to lie, steal, kill, commit adultery and sodomy, etc.  Ain't none of this changed.  It remains the same generation after generation no matter what country you are from.  Moral law prescribes our social duties such as &quot;thou shalt love thy neighbor&quot; and &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot;, as well as our<br>
internal attitudes--thou shalt not covet.  Moral law is not a rite or a ceremony.<br>
<br>
Many false prophets tell you to go back and do the works of the law.  To understand this and contend with it, read Galatians.<br>
<br>
Many false prophets tell you that you will be a slave to sin all the days of your life.  To understand this and contend with it, read Romans chapters 6, 7, and 8 CONSECUTIVELY.  Folks take one scripture out of context to tell you you will always be under bondage to sin.  Note in these passages the following distinctions<br>
<br>
law of God<br>
law in my members<br>
law of my mind<br>
law of sin and death<br>
law of the Spirit<br>
<br>
Consider what Brother Paul says &quot;and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here are few excerpted definitions from Webster's 1828--<br>
<br>
MOR'AL, a. [L. moralis, from mos, moris, manner.]<br>
1.  ...has reference to the law of God as the standard by which their character is to be determined.  The word however may be applied to actions which affect only, or primarily and principally, a person's own happiness.<br>
2.  Subject to the moral law and capable of moral actions; bound to perform social duties; as a moral agent or being.<br>
4.  Conformed to rules of right, or to the divine law respecting social duties; virtuous; just; as when we say, a particular action is not moral.<br>
7.  In general, moral denotes something which respects the conduct of men and their relations as social beings whose actions have a bearing on each others's rights and happiness, and are therefore right or wrong, virtuous or vicious; as moral character; moral views; moral knowledge; moral sentiments; moral maxims; moral approbation; moral doubts; moral justice;<br>
moral virtue; moral obligations, &amp;c.  Or moral denotes something which respects the intellectual powers of man, as distinct form his physical powers. Thus we speak of moral evidence, moral arguments, moral persuasion, moral certainty, moral force; which operate on the mind.<br>
<br>
Moral law, the law of God which prescribes the moral or social duties, and prohibits the transgression of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
MORAL'ITY, n.  The doctrine or system of moral duties, or the duties of men in their social character; ethics.<br>
 The system of morality to be gathered from the writings of ancient sages, falls very short of that delivered in the gospel.<br>
1.  The practice of the moral duties; virtue.  We often admire the politeness of men whose morality we question.<br>
2.  The quality of an action which renders it good; the conformity of an act to the divine law, or to the principles of rectitude.  This conformity implies that the act must be performed by a free agent, and from a motive of obedience to the divine will.  This is the strict theological and scriptural sense of morality.  But we often apply the word to actions<br>
which accord with justice and human laws, without reference to the motives form which they proceed.<br>
<br>
MOR'ALLY, adv.  In a moral or ethical sense; according to the rules of morality.<br>
 By good, morally so called, bonum honestum ought chiefly to be understood.<br>
2.  According to the rules of the divine law.  An action is not in strictness morally good, which does not proceed from good motives, or a principle of love and obedience to the divine law and to the lawgiver. Charity bestowed to gratify pride, or justice done by compulsion, cannot be morally good in the sight of God.<br>

A xian family wouldn't struggle---the biblically superior husband would protect his morally and intellectually inferior wife by making the decision and taking responsiblity for the results himself. <br>
<br>
The rest of us might answer something like this...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Scenario...<br>
Two parents are discussing discipline for their child. The child has broken something that belonged to the<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->... <br>
<br>
Parents who have not discussed how to raise children and discussed things like whether to baptise, religious/non-religious upbringing, daycare, parental roles and the dreaded corporal vs. time out punishment should be flogged themselves!! How valuabe the item is, moreover is not really that relevant to the punishment except to get across to a child that some things should be handled with extra care and matter more to the owner when you are careless and lose or break them---assuming the perpetrator is older than 4 years!!<br>
<br>
That said--parents should seek information if they don't have it already from professionals and even friends and family they respect and be willing to reconsider their own ideas. I went through the very thing with a biting phase recently and was told to bite my son back, slap him harder, yell really loud etc. and my dh and I talked, and talked and talked and did our best meanwhile (like 24 hours worth at first just to try to stop the biting before he got kicked out of daycare). We both learned alot and compromised on things, actually taking an approach neither of us had originally thought of or wanted!! Go figure. With hitting kids I can't see much compromise, but perhaps they could at least agree to do some quick learning (tell kid you'll sleep on it then run to computer/bookstore/elder/sister/mom/daycare lady) and implement Plan United Parental Front together. <br>
<br>
P.S. I hate when one parent does all the punishing and the other says &quot;wait til you &lt;insert parent&gt; gets home&quot;. What a crappy role for the spanker/grounder.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Scenario...<br>
A married couple go car shopping. The wife wants to get a minivan, no kids yet but planning on a family. The husband wants a two seater sports car, the kids won't be for two or three years, plenty of time to trade it in later for the minivan. How do you respect both people, give equal consideration to each persons wants/needs? Buy both cars, or buy none?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wow--again personal experience. Firstly, no shopping without extensive research including Consumer Reports, blue book and safety records--regardless of whether or not children will be riding. Then talk, talk, talk to decide together. Perhaps a bigger car but not van or sporty, truck version of SUV or a motorcycle for dad on the side and cheaper van for mom now...there are hundreds of options that can make both feel good. <br>
<br>
Sometimes you do give in on some things too in marriage, but certainly not because of what's between your legs or because one of you was &quot;meant to be the head&quot;. I laid down veeeery firm rules when dh and I returned from a relo that I would only move if it could be done before ds was born but really didn't want a 2 story. I didn't care about it that terribly much, but it's really bad for me now with degenerative arthritis setting in on my knees... but I knew he loved this house and decided early on that if he could come through on getting the house, moving in, fixing up the old one (by himself no less) that where we went and what the house looked like wasn't my main thing. The bigger issue for me was the timing, so I feel I got that and the big issue for him was the 3 car garage with &quot;man room&quot; added on back, pre-done landscaping and 2 stories with all the things he liked. We both won, we both gave in on some things. Had nothing to do with gender.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I would assume all of the people here have to submit in some way or another to there spouse.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
No. You are confusing submission with compromise. I compromise on things at work but don't consider it &quot;submitting&quot; to the other team members. The difference is the differing gender roles, assumptions about women's god-given (or not given) abilities and final decision maker. The man's role is not equal, it is the CEO...sure he takes input and respects his underlings, but he has the power.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But he is the head of my house and I respect him.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Some wish to live in a kingdom as a servant to a ruler they adore. I wish to live in a democracy with no head, but a congress of leadership compromising, talking, discussing and working it out on equal ground. <br>

I just feel bad for the children. I don't think it is healthy for a boy growing up to see that example or for girls to see it. And I sure don't want my daughter involved with a young man who grew up thinking its a woman's role to be submissive. Though I am fairly sure my DD could hold her own against that. And I could easily see dating a woman who was like that very much frustrate my boy. How....boring. <br>
<br>
<br>
DH and I have discussed how we will rear our children before we even had them. Its not firm in writing but it is a ground work on how we will handle things. But if for some reason I disagreed with DH on a punishment, and it was his item and the child was around I wouldn't say a word. If the child wasn't around, I would expressed what I disliked about it, but would let DH handle it because it was his item broke. It would be compromise not submission. I would expect him to afford me the same curtisy if the roles were reversed. <br>
<br>
As for the car...well, we have been in this situation a couple of times. We are so bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  we impulsed shopped several cars. Its so pathetic. But I loved my Kia. We would go with nothing in mind on what we wanted. All i wanted was a back seat (we were pregnant) and room to drive that car in my ninth month. We never really had trouble compromising. If the other wouldn't agree we would pass the car up and keep on looking. We eventually found one where we both agreed. <br>
<br>
Now the last car we bought DH didn't even go with me to pick it out. I found that very annoying. Yeah it was my money buying the car, but he would be doing most of the driving (even though he didn't have his license at the time so couldn't test drive but I couldn't wait the three months he took to actually get his license over here). So I guess I wore the pants in that instance. I picked out and bought the car on my own. And remind him he had a chance to have an opinion on the car when I was buying it every time he complains about it. Actually I am a little upset with him not even giving me an opinion on the car thing. I'm not a car person. But I love my car. Even if the jerk got into a wreck with it friday!!!!

<br>
 I think women (in general) are naturally more compassionate, nurturing, spiritual (and intelligent <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  And God gave the men the responsibility of the priesthood and leadership in the home(note leader not boss) to help make up for their lack in those other areas.<br>
<br>
My dh and I are first and foremost best friends.  When it comes to decisions we are equals.  We discuss our thoughts and ideas and then come to a compromise.  <br>
<br>
I do expect him to take the lead in things like Family prayer, family council and family home evening and other spiritual matters.  At times though I have been the more committed one in our family and so I shared my ideas and sugestions but allowed him to grow by backing off of the decision making process leaving it in his hands.  This says I trust you and support you and I want you to be successful.<br>
<br>
The man is not above the woman.  Even in the creation story, Eve is called a help meet, not a help mate.    She was taken out of his side, to stand beside him.  We have equal but different charachteristics. Physically, emotionally and spiritually we are two halves of a whole.  The perfect match.<br>
<br>
There is a joke in the LDS church that the husband may preside, but the wife usually conducts.  In other words that old saying that behind every great man there is a great woman.<br>
<br>
I think the concern lies when people assume that because a woman is wife and mother that she cant have any other role.  Which is definitly not our doctrine (admittedly there are jerky LDS men out there who think this way)  As LDS women we are strongly encouraged to get an education and the brethern recognize that having a sahm in every home is not feasible.  Whether financially not a possiblity or for the health and well being of the woman and family.  <br>
<br>
Personal example - I was a sahm for two years.  I was perusing the want ads one day, dh was thinking of changing jobs.  I ran across the job I have now.  I felt a distinct prompting that I should look at this job and that it was a perfect fit for me and my skills.  I looked it up and everything I had ever loved in my previous jobs was wrapped up into this postion and it was part time with benefits making what I had been making before staying home.  I had not planned on going back to work until my dd was  in school but I applied for the job and went through the interviewing process knowing that I would get the job.  <br>
<br>
When I started working it became very apparent to me that I had missed the professional half of myself more than I had realized.  It wasnt a financial need, but an emotional need that the Lord knew I had. <br>
<br>
No one should ever judge the way another couple chooses to divy out responsibilities and roles. <br>

<br>
In the first one..I can't imagine why the parents wouldn't have spoken about their desired/preferred discipline methods before having children...I can't imagine that they would leave it until a child needs disciplining to have that conversation.  Somewhere along the line before this point, they would have/should have, come to a compromise on the subject.<br>
<br>
As for the car...again...I doubt two people would go out looking for a car, with clear ideas in mind, but not having spoken to their spouse about it.  I would assume that most people would talk, research etc.. before deciding what kind of car they are going to get, and (again) come to a compromise over it.<br>
<br>
There is a huge difference between submission and compromise...one is a master/servant relationship, one is an equal partnership where the two people realise that they can't always have it their own way! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.growthspurts.com/drivee/images/434360233606.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/3/03 9:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=96.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: marital roles</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No one should ever judge the way another couple chooses to divy out responsibilities and roles.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
And yet this is what the bible and the quote from your elder does. I agree with you about the judging part, especially for women who seem to get crap no matter what we choose.<br>
<br>
And on the priesthood thing, which I have heard before...blech<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's patronizing to men and somewhat disengenuous. I am sure you believe this, but that's like saying slaves in ancient Greece were equal but just with different characteristics...oh weh!! See DBC's quote of Orwell and read Animal Farm to get what we're saying here.<br>
<br>
Again--I also am fine with Heather, totalfeline and anyone else being submissive (though I agree it's not healthiest for the children). I worry about the implications this theology has for working women when these &quot;priests&quot; take their beliefs with them to work, but can do little about this. What started this was the subject coming up in another thread, and while we agree the bible calls for the submission of women, we do not agree it is right (how surprising<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
On a debate board you are expected to back up your claims and make your case through logic and data. None of the xians here have proven that a life based on JC makes for a longer marriage, happier family or for that matter more fully developed man capable of leading anyone (granted I have a specific example in mind). You claimed it did. Your elder was quoted, then we refuted. The only thing then that any xian here has proven is that the bible calls them to submission--we already agreed on that.<br>

and may I add a recommendation to DL's which is using your own words to answer these questions. A simple to the point one would do nicely and make us think you actually know why you believe and act the way you do. Take some lessons from Candy who uses sources and references she actually reads and studies first then use these to explain your position.<br>

You can seek one out because you feel you yourself need one, but as soon as you say all women need it you are committing an error in judgment that is prejudicial and unfounded.  If you replaced woman in that sentence with black or jew or other demographic archetype it would be equally wrong.<br>

When my wife and I bought our cars we laid out the budget and decided what we could afford.  We ran thru consumer reports and buyer guides and decided what we needed.  We then went out and shopped around some (I say some because a long time friend of mine manages a dealership so we always end up getting the best deal from him) and made our purchase.  When I bought my car she played devils advocate for me as the voice of reason, when she bought her car I played devils advocate for her as the voice of reason.  The part that impacts us both (money) we worked out together.  The parts that impacted us individually more (what car wed be stuck in) the individual took the lead on.  <br>

When it comes to discipline of our kids, we dont spank unless their life is in jeopardy (ex: fork in an outlet) and that has been one time, between 2 kids, ever.  If you communicate with people effectively, yes even children, then you dont need to resort to violence and battery to get your way.  I was raised in a spanking household.  I came into my relationship expecting to be spanking my kids.  I was shown the error of my ways and have since not spanked my kids.  My wife did the research, she showed me her info, she persuasively argued her case and I quite happily abide by her recommendation because it was right all on its own, irrespective of which of us presented it.  Facts win out.  Violence is the last resort if the ignorant.<br>

Heather, despite your kind words about the worth of my question, I am still left wondering, if the OT law was abolished, and the NT law is all we need, and as your article points out and CEREMONIAL law is worthless, how does this reconcile with the first 3 commandments since they are all ceremonial as well?  The answer that I think I know is that you selectively apply the bible to your life.  I think that following the bible strictly is impossible in this day and age and that while you apply it more rigidly than most, you still fall short of the mark.  I further call you out on the I havent studied this out myself hooey because if your immortal soul is in jeopardy, you damn well better study it out or you are a hypocrite and a liar before god.  If he can curse a fig tree to wither and die, never to bear fruit again when it wasnt even in SEASON, how will he take your decision to disregard whole sections of his laws?  Nope, you are not a true christian and you certainly arent saved. <br>

Like I said I dont care to study this out.  It is of no use to me.  Its common sense why we dont do those things anymore.  That article just went into further detail.  I didn't feel I needed to waste my time and study to answer a question you could really care less about. <br>

It is so nice when a person can comfortably admit that they don't really care about the word of god.  I must admit, I am surprised to see your total lack of concern for His law though as I noticed how easily you toss it around otherwise.  Again, in case you missed it, my point isn't that I am concerned for the answer, because I have already answered it myself.  On the contrary, I think YOU should be concerned about the answer.  Obviously since you do not trifle with studying god's laws you are not worried about his kindom.<br>

1 Cor. 2:13-16  Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the HolyGhost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.  But the natural man (you DBC) receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him:  neither can he<br>
 know them, because they are spiritually discerned.   But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.  For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?  But we have the mind of Christ.<br>
