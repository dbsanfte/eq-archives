-----<br>
Hope, springs eternal.<br>
  -Unknown<br>
-----<br>
<br>
The arguing is constant. Harper fights with Tyr, Beka snaps at Harper, Trance just sits there, staring into space with a lost expression on her face. Rommie, Rommie hasn't stopped crying in two days. I can't say I blame them, tensions have been running high since 'it' happened.<br>
<br>
I'm Dylan Hunt, and two days ago, the Andromeda Ascendant, my starship was destroyed by a passenger we'd picked up. I'm sure here intentions started out well enough, but there was something, evil, about her. Somehow she set of a thermite bomb near the reactor chamber and Harper had ordered a shipwide evacuation.<br>
<br>
I don't blame him. I'm sure that if there was anything he could have done, he would, but even from the bridge it was very obvious that the bomb had completely burnt away all the shielding around the compartment. A reasonably fit Nietzschean in hazard gear would have been dead before taking three steps, there was literally nothing Harper could have done.<br>
<br>
Trance and Tyr picked us up, and we decided, with a complete lack of better ideas, to go to see the Perseids. They've been one of our longest supporters, and right now, I think we need all the support we can get.<br>
<br>
I watch from one of the deck seats as the Maru swings into orbit around Perseus Beta, one of the outlying planets of the Perseids home system, and the home of the new Academy and shipyards. It's amazing what they did here, but even the most conservative estimate suggests that they won't have a new heavy cruiser ready for two to three years.<br>
<br>
Beka guides us in with a steady hand, and chief technical director Rekeeb meets us at the dockyard. It's an automatic thing, something done because he is the highest ranking person here. I'm not sure he understands how emotionally drained we all are.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan?&quot; Beka's voice snaps me out of my reverie, and I glance about to find myself in a guest quarter of some sort. This isn't good, I hadn't even noticed we'd left the docking yard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Beka?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You need to get some sleep. You haven't slept for almost three days,&quot; she says, before sitting down on the couch across from me. I rub my palm across my chin, and realise that I am dog tired.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're probably right,&quot; I say as I get up and pace about the room. &quot;But every time i close my eyes, I see the Andromeda blow up. I see... it's like i'm watching my best friend die, over and over again.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiles at me, &quot;I thought you'd say that.&quot; I frown for a moment, and something instinctively makes me jerk sideways, but i'm far too slow and i feel the distinctive hiss of an injection.<br>
<br>
Even as i start to fall forward, eyes drooping, i see Beka sand up to catch me. my lights go out before i hit the ground.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Consciousness returns slowly, and I find myself, covered, but completely nude in a bed in the guest quarters. For a very brief moment I wonder who had the honor of putting me to bed, and then I dismiss it as not being important.<br>
<br>
My head feels clear, and while there is still a lot of pain for the loss of the Andromeda, I feel like I can go on.<br>
<br>
I slowly get out of bed, and move over to the food dispenser, to get some cold water, which is thankfully very cold and finishes waking me up. I'm just about getting ready to get some clothes on when I hear an excited knock.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan, Dylan are you awake?&quot; I hear Trance yell as I slip on a robe and some slippers, before opening the door. I almost stumble back, as the gold warrior before me looks at me with a giddy smile on her face. It seems, out of place, both given her personal nature, and the circumstance<br>
<br>
&quot;Trance? What's the problem?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing, you've got to come see this.&quot;<br>
<br>
I let her drag me down the corridor, dark blue robe, slippers and all to one of the many viewpoints at the aptly named, Phoenix station.<br>
<br>
As we turn the corner to the planet side of the base and look out, I hear a strangled gasp, which I soon realised is my own. Sitting outside, at less than 2 kilometers is a apparently fully functional High Guard XMC class Heavy cruiser.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah good, captain Hunt, I'm so glad Trance was able to find you.&quot; <br>
<br>
My breath is heavy in my throat as I turn an accusing glare at the technical director. &quot;Rekeeb,&quot; I say, raising my hands in question, &quot;How is this possible, I was told two yeas before the first XMC was produced.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I know. It truly is an amazing display of probability that one of the salvage teams found a nearly intact High Guard ship pout near Tellas 9 three days ago. Especially since she wasn't supposed to go to Tellas 9, but dropped into that system to fix a sudden imbalance in the reactor. We towed her back and have almost finished refitting her. &quot; He looks at me, and I can almost see a smile on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, we don't have an AI to install in her, so we're probably going to have to put her into drydock untill we can build one. Unless you have a suitable AI, captain Hunt?&quot; <br>
<br>
I smile at him, &quot;Yes, this new ship can never replace the loss of the Andromeda, I'd be honored if you'd let it be Rommie's home.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not a problem, you'll find all of your personal belongings, and all of your crew save for Trance here has already boarded. I understand Harper is very happy to be helping the refit crews.&quot;<br>
<br>
I grin ruefuly at him and Trance as they give me identical grins, and I can just feel the universe tatooing the word 'sucker' to my forehead. Rekeeb nods at me and heads off to do something, right now I don't care what.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trance, why didn't you wake me earlier?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Beka's orders.&quot; she smiles. &quot;She thought you needed the sleep, and after seeing how fast you fell over when I injected the sedative, I think she was right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She was.&quot; I pause for a moment, and look back out at the ship. &quot;An amazing coincidence, Rekeeb said. That mean anything to you?&quot; <br>
<br>
I watch as her shoulders twitch and she turns to me with a serious expression on her face. she takes a step towards me so we're practically touching and she glances around furtively, before giving me an ear to ear grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now Dylan, don't spoil the moment,&quot; she gives me a quick peck on the cheeck before turning back to the ship studiously ignoring me. I'm tempted to keep asking, but I don't really see the point. Trance will do what she does, and in the end, the how isn't nearly as important as the fact that it has happened.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, does the ship have a name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Rommie said she wanted the ship to be called the Andromeda Arising.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Andromeda Arising. It's a good name.&quot;<br>
<br>
and honestly, it doesn't matter, because we have a home again.<br>

<br>
I don't agree with just finding a new ship so conveniently at all...<br>
<br>
Another thing, the computer core on the Andromeda is vast.  Much more data there than could be stored in Rommie.  There's no way that Rommie could take over all the functions of a ship with such a huge part of herself missing.<br>
<br>
I just can't believe this part.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
