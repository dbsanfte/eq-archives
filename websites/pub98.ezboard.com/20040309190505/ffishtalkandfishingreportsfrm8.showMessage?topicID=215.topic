<br>
It depends on what kind of reel your going to put it on.  I use the power pro on spinning and baitcasters.  I put a mono backing on it to keep it from slipping on the spool.  The spinning reels it's not necessary to keep it reel tight when putting it on.  It comes off like a dream.  With the baitcasters I will usually put some sort of glove on and put it on tight.  I've had no problems with it biting into itself spooling this way.  Plus you get a lot more distance on your casts with the braid in my opinion.  Less memory = more distance.  They've added a smooth coating to the braid that helps it tremendously.  The first time I used spiderwire.  I had the problems that Bass601 is describing.  I haven't tried it since, but things have come a long way since then. <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">

But bear in mind I walk the bank with only one baitcaster. I reallly like the sensitivity of the braid. And the no stretch. I never devloped a good 'cross their eyes' hookset so the no stretch works very well for me. If you do have a hard hookset, you'll need to back off your drag or you'll rip the hook out. I also like the size. I use 50 pound which is the size of 12 pound mono, I pull in logs from time to time. Saves on lost lures <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I always color the last few feet of line with black,brown, or green marker. It seems to blend in much better. I don't use a leader.<br>
<br>
I'd say give it a try. <br>

<br>
1.  It digs into the spool every time you put it under load.  Set the hook, get hung, whatever, and your next cast is going that distance.<br>
<br>
2.  Probably the clincher problem is its strength is unpredictable.  There are times that you'll pull an anchor cleat off the boat before you can break off a hung jig or worm and there are times when it will break on the hookset.  Admittedly, I set the hook hard.  Still, I've broke more fish off on it on what I'd call relatively tame hooksets than any line I've used.  I tried both fireline and powerpro with the same results.  The others aren't an option for me since they don't come in florescent and cant' be fished at night too well.  <br>
<br>
I've gone back to mono.  As bad as the sensitivity is with regular mono, its a lot less aggrivation and its dependable.  The only plus the braid has is the sensitivity, but if you regularly break off fish on the hookset, its not worth much to know they are there.<br>

I think it's just like anything you try.  Sometimes you have to see for yourself whether you like it or not.  Personally, I've never broke off a fish on braid.  That's a ton of fish too.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I do use 30 lb. Powerpro, and have 10 lb. on two spinning reels.  It's all a matter of preference, and that's what's great about posting it on a board.   Your going to get all kinds of different opinions based on what each individual likes to use.<br>
<br>
Here's a little tip too.  Leave a little tag end when tying your lure on.  braid has no stretch, and if you cinch it down and trim the tag end snug to the knot.  It will have a chance to slip through the knot on a hard hook-set.  Wet your knot good. <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">

<br>
In the highland reservoirs, we fish rocks.  If you've never fished a lake that varies upwards of 30 feet in depth in a given year, its hard to explain.  Very few of these lakes have grass in them, and mud bottoms aren't something we typically fish.  Most of the fishing with worms is done off of steep rocky banks.  The rocks will fray your line.  It just seems that mono will slide over a wet rock with less damage than will braid.  <br>
<br>
My first experience with braid was Fireline.  I put it on for a tournament on Douglas and broke off 4 or 5 fish one night.  Being a little disgusted, I did some testing to see where I went wrong.  Speculating that it might be the knot pulling loose, I did some knot tests.  Pur a hook in a vice and using an axe handle to dally the fireline off of, I tested several knots.  A double wrapped Palomar was the absolute strongest I found.  <br>
<br>
The next trip, with the double looped palomars, I still broke off fish.  One of the fish I broke off, I set the hook on it so hard that it came out of the water before the line broke.  Unfortunately, the fish was gut hooked and died, but it gave me the opportunity to see what broke.  It wasn't the knot.  Indeed it was the line.<br>
<br>
The next trip, I fished 30lb Power Pro instead of the 14 pound Fireline I had tried.  Admittedly, the Power Pro was better, but it still had unexpected break offs and the digging problem.<br>
<br>
I suppose the reason for the digging problem is using it on worm rigs and jig rigs.  Reeling the slower baits, will always loosen the lay of the line on the spool.  However these 2 tactics are the only 2 where I see it with an advantage.  Maybe a crank bait where you want the bait to run deeper, but the low stretch would cause you to loose fish on a crank bait.  You'd be better off adding some lead to the bait.<br>

<br>
Skipper,  That paragraph says it all.  Mitch told me a few years back of a test he did with braids vs. mono.  If your fishing rip rap or rock you are better off with some sort of mono.  The test Mitch did was rubbing both sets of lines back and forth over rock.  The braid would fray and break, while the mono held up a little better.  When Mitch performed this same test on a wood log.  He said you could cut through wood with the braid, and the mono would break easily.  So the cover you fish should play a huge role in your choice of line.<br>
Mitch,  please correct me if I skewed the facts a little.  It's been a while since you posted that thread on Braid vs. Mono. <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">

Under the conditions I use it the abrasion resitance between it and mono is substantial. I broke off many fish with mono because you have to get the fish up on top of the pads fast or they will wrap you up and get off. I have never broken the spiderwire and I only use the twelve pound test. I also tried it on a casting rod with faster baits like spinnerbaits. When running them fast to keep them just under the surface I was taking the bait away more often than getting a hookup. When the water column from the surface to the weeds is one to two feet you don't have much choice other than run 'em fast. That is one of a few situations where stretch is desirable. You can get away with no stretch line if you use rods softer than I use but I use broom sticks. As far as sensitivity goes I have never felt that mono wasn't sensitive enough under any conditions I fish. It is my choice for all other fishing.<br>
