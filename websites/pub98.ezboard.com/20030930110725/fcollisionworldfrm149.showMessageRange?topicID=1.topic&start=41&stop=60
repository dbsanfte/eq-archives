He fell to his knees before her convulsing form, trying to hold her still.  But she was inconsolable...and still asleep.  Why wasn't she waking up?<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris,&quot; he said loudly, grabbign her shoulders enough to shake her.  &quot;Eris, it's me, it's Seif, wake up! you're having a nightmare, Eris..!&quot;<br>
<br>
Eris mistook the firm grip as some fearful wraith Seifer could not imagine grabbing her, obviously, because his touch only made her struggle more, and scream louder.<br>
<br>
&quot;N...nn...NO!&quot; she cried loudly, struggling, her hands balling into fists.  She slugged Seifer right in the face, propelling him backwards.  &quot;Just leave me be...!  Who..are..y..who...SEIFER!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm right here, Eris!!!&quot; Seifer crawled back toward her, his lip bleeding.  Her eyes were open wide but unseeing, and filled with terror.  Seifer looked up at Kirin helplessly, looking lost and defenseless, despite his brute strength.  Strength could do nothing for this.  He grabbed her by her arms and pinned her down.  &quot;Eris!!! I'm here!&quot;<br>
<br>
As he said 'here', she froze in his grip.  Her eyes closed, then fluttered open, the screams dying on her lips.<br>
<br>
The mine was plunged into silence, save Eris' heavy breathing. Seifer stared down at her, concern and fear in his green eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris...&quot; he whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;S-Seifer...?&quot; she said weakly, her voice hoarse.  He nodded assuringly, stroking her cheek and pulling her up into his arms as would a mother to a frightened child.  At first her body was tense against his, but then as reality set in she collapsed against him, shaking in relief.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aw, Seif, I had this weird, horrible dream,&quot; she rasped.  &quot;We were in the woods and we saw this girl and this guy fighting and I summoned a dragon and then we all got teleported to a mine where I saw...&quot;  She suddenly paused and looked up, looking at everyone, who was looking at her.  She blinked a few times, realizing that at least part of it wasn't a dream.  Then she looked at Seifer, and his lip, form which blood trickled down his chin.  Her stomach reeled and and her face flushed in embarrassment, and she realized suddenly that she was holding the blond man in a death grip.  She quickly, almost roughly, pushed away, jumping to her feet, matting back her hair nervously as she backed away form them all.  &quot;I...I...Excuse me for a second...I need to...to...&quot;  she stuttered, walking off into the darkness beyond, holding her head in shame.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/7/03 7:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm149.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightmare</span><hr size=1> Kirin looked down... she knew she could do something.<br>

After Eris had woken up and trudged off... with a very embarrassed look across her face... Kirin went off after her and finally caught up.<br>

Nina blinked in shock, watching the whole ordeal silently.  She was obviously a little scared now.  Thalia was also taken aback, wondering what had made the girl Eris so scared.  Balder showed no emotion, but looked a little worried nonetheless.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, uh, Mr. Seifer,&quot; Nina said, trying to get his attention, &quot;what's wrong with Miss Eris?  Or do you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
Thalia's green eyes shifted from Eris, a good distance away, to Nina.  She glanced up at Seifer and waited for a response.<br>

He agreed.  He was getting a little uneasy, actually...closed spaces made him feel confined.  He didn't like that feeling at all.  And that sound of water...<br>

&quot;I don't know, Kirin.  It's hard to explain.  We are partners...and don't look at me like that,&quot; she chuckled as Kirin grinned at her.  &quot;And we're great friends...but it's a one sided love...isn't it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris! Kirin!&quot; <br>
<br>
Eris' heart panged when she saw Seifer running out of the darkness, panting for breath.  But the look on his face turned her heartache into concern.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br>

&quot;I suggest you pull out the map, figure out exact way out. It'd be nice for memorization. Seifer since you two are partners you're both leading, he's holding the light thus allowing Eris to see..&quot; She then pointed to Balder, &quot;You carry Nina so we can move more quickly.&quot; <br>

They stopped when they got to the group and looked over the map.<br>

&quot;Um, Balder...&quot; Nina said, woken again, &quot;can you put me down now?  Or at least on your shoulders or something...&quot;<br>

Balder sweat-dropped, but did nothing.  That was the only way he knew how to carry someone while running in the dark...  <p>~Z<br>

Fwoosh!  From where she pointed, the sound of gushing water filled the air, and a massive wave blocked the way, shooting swiftly up the mine shaft.<br>

&quot;Double crap!&quot; she squeaked.  She pointed the opposite way.  &quot;Um..it could be this way, too,&quot; she offered.  &quot;RUN!!!&quot;<br>

Eris shot quickly up the shaft, Seifer trailing behind her, not as fast as the nimble pickpocket.
