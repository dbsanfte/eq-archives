He ordered a Coke when the waitress asked him what he wanted. The singer wasn't one of the usual drunks, <br>
<br>
he'd always come here to get away from the normal society that he was surrounded by, he looked slightly annoyed when he heard himself singing on the bars choice of music. He just couldn't get away from himself, he rubbed his eyes. <br>
<br>
A rarity that he wasnt wearing any make. And he spotted the silver haired man and blinked at him once or twice. And then decided to make him self noticable, and he slouched in the chair. <br>
<br>
He could feel that sensation of wanting to be completly gone from the planet. But he ignored it. Because he didnt want anyone slightly sad that he was gone. and then he thought. <br>

Enari kept glaring at Ayashi, who was now sitting down at a talbe of his own.<br>
He could feel more and more people staring at him every second... which was starting to make him uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
(i'm controlling Ayashi becuase Baka Yecal hasn't been on in at least two days)<br>
<br>
Ayashi ordered a water, and Enari came over and sat down at his table.<br>
<br>
Ayashi looked over at Enari.<br>
&quot;Hello.&quot; He smiled.<br>
&quot;Hello.&quot; Enari narrowed his eyes.<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Ayashi asked, sensing something dark about Enari. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/10/03 10:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enari</span><hr size=1> Enari glared at him a moment.<br>
&quot;First you will answer...&quot; Enari got cut off by the signal he was feeling.... the girl was starting to control her powers better now... That girl that's he's after. The one that his master had sent him for.<br>
&quot;Do you know a girl with blue hair and violet eyes?&quot; He asked, Ayashi shook his head and Enari stood up... the feeling was getting stronger.<br>
::she's having a dream:: he thought as he walked out the door.<br>
Ayashi just stared after with a puzzled look<br>

 The bartender came up to her, &quot;Can I get you anything?&quot;<br>
 &quot;hell, why not.&quot; Ayeaka said boardly. &quot;just some water for now.&quot; she said as she eyed the room again.<br>

Ayeaka just took a sip and turned away from the bartender, ignoring her.<br>

She was wearing a pair of tight black pants that flared at the bottoms, some black heels, a black tube top since it was slightly warm outside, and a thin black duster that she buttoned in the middle so the top of her tummy and below her belly button was exposed a little. She had in her silver naval ring which she didn't wear too much anymore and was also wearing her big silver hoop earrings and tounge ring. She had her long blonde hair down, it came to about her back. She hated the way it looked sometimes, it looked like she dyed it but she had natural different shades of blonde in her hair. She got a little nervous as she began to walk farther into the bar, she started biting her french manicured nails but stopped, she was trying to cut the habit. She sat down at the bar and looked behind her at all the people. &quot;Want something sweety?&quot; The bartender lady asked her. &quot;Umm...actually...yeah, a hard lemonade please.&quot; She smiled very big, showing that she was a little more comfortable. The bartender sat down her drink on a small napkin. &quot;Just tell me if you'd like anything else dear.&quot; Athena grinned and nodded.

Leo sighed and entered the bar. He hadn't been at Echoes Bar long before getting emabrassed and leaving. He sighed and took a seat at the bar, making sure to keep his hood and cloak tight around him so as not to suffer more stares and gasps of horror. He didn't bother ordering a drink... he couldn't drink it anyway with his &quot;condition&quot;. He looked around, suspiciously, though he couldn't help but wonder what Psychi was doing at that moment... <p>Lotsa Luvs!<br>
