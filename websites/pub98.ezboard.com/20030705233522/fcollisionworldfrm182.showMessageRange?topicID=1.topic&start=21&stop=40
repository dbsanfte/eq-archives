She only had one dress because he hadn't been shopping a while, but it was a gorgeous dress anyways. <br>
<br>
She slipped on the sleek black dress that stopped a little above her knees.  She left her hair down and slipped on a pair of black heels. Andrya had on a white gold necklace with a small diamond on it, a diamond tenis bracelet on each hand, and simple diamond earrings. Her makeup was natural and very light, which completed her simplistic look. <br>
<br>
She walked to the back balcony then closed and locks its doors. After checking the doors, she walked over to Jen's condo to see if she was home. <br>
<br>
Andrya knocked on the door, and when no one answered, she just turned the knob.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>'Dammit, it's locked!'</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she said to herself. <br>
<br>
She went back to her condo but kept the door open a little just in case Jen came before she had to leave. <p>--------<br>

He thought it was kind of funny that to the naked eye his vehicle looked like a normal motorcycle.  He shook his head and walked into the building.  The place was nice and big.  Andrya deserved it.  After trying to go to the 18th floor in the elevator he realized he needed a key or something to make the thing work.<br>
<br>
He called Andrya's cell and told her he was here.  He tell her later that the elevator hadn't worked, he wouldn't trouble her with it now.<br>
<br>
He waited for only a moment before the elevator dinged.  From within the elevator stepped an angel.  She wore a black dress that made her look even more stunning than he had last remembered her.<br>

&quot;You look beautiful.&quot;  He said to her as he seemingly stared. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xprettyxxgirl>xprettyxxgirl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/17/03 10:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm182.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skyye Condominiums *picture on post*</span><hr size=1> Andrya slighty blushed as she complimented him.

<br>
The elevator rose, and stopped but the door didn't open.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dammit&quot; Serina said as she hit her head, &quot;The security key!&quot;<br>
<br>
She slid the key into the slot and the doors opened. Jen had been right about Andrya leaving her door open, she walked in and gasped. <br>
<br>
&quot;This place is huge!&quot; she thought. <br>
<br>
&quot;Andrya!!!&quot; she hollered through the house while looking in each room. <br>
<br>
She was no where to be found. Serina knew she must be out with a guy, and probably wouldn't be home tonight, so she found a room with a bed. She set her stuff down next to the bed stand and took a shower.<br>
<br>
After the shower, she put on a red satin robe that she knew was her sister's, and crawled under the covers of the master bed. <p>--------<br>

&quot;Spitting image of her sister. She's going to be a hit with the guys later.&quot; She walked into her room and sighed. She took a quick shower, and got in a big oversized tshirt and boxer shorts. She took out her journal that she had put on the end table, and started writing.<br>

Someone sounds tired....&quot; Andrya laughed loudly. Jennifer winced<br>
&quot;Shhh, what's up? Isn't it like early?&quot; She rubbed her eyes.<br>
&quot;I dunno, whatcha doin today?&quot; Jennifer sighed, and was about to tell Andrya about Rini, but then smiled. It'll just be a surprise, she thought.<br>
&quot;I have a busy day planned,&quot; Jennifer said, thinking about the quite empty white walls &quot;and so do you... Hey where are you?&quot;<br>
&quot;At Jacob's, duh, Oh wait, I never told you.. oops...&quot; SHe giggled. Jennifer rolled her eyes.<br>
&quot;haha have fun?&quot; Jennifer asked, standing up and walking out to the balcony. She knew if she could see her friends face there would be a huge grin there.<br>
&quot;Of course!&quot; Jen yawned.<br>
&quot;Well hurry up and get home so you can get your to-do list done&quot;<br>
&quot;I will, Jacob might come with me though. I don't feel like being alone.&quot; Jen smiled, and knew that Andrya would kill her for not saying anything about her kid sister. Even more so because of Jacob coming with her, but it's not like Serina wasn't used to it from before...<br>
&quot;Kay, talk to ya later?&quot; Jennifer smiled. <br>
&quot;Yep, later.&quot; Jen laughed.<br>
&quot;Lates,&quot; Jennifer hung up the phone and went to take a quick shower. They'd be here soon, and she wanted to see Andrya's face when she saw Serina<br>

It was going to be a casual day, for sure, so she picked out a pair of baggy cargos and a tank top. She put them on and walked out into her living room, and after putting her hair in a bun she grabbed a book and walked out to the balcony, and sat on the floor. Andrya would be there any minute, so she decided to keep her self occupied til then.<br>

Once they had gotten on and off the elevator Andrya searched for her room key. <br>
<br>
&quot;Uhh, it's in here somewhere...&quot; she said, digging through her purse. &quot;Ahh, found it!&quot;<br>
<br>
She took the key out and turned the knob. &quot;You'll have to excuse the emptyness, I just haven't had time to decorate.&quot;<br>
<br>
She set her purse down on the table and slid her arm around Jacob. &quot;I'm sure you won't mind,though.&quot; Andrya grinned at him and then playfully kissed his lips. <p>--------<br>

&quot;Hey Jen,&quot; Andrya smiled. Jennifer grinned.<br>
&quot;So how was your night?&quot; She smiled. <br>
&quot;Good.&quot; Andrya grinned. <br>
&quot;well....let's not stand here, let's go get some shopping done.&quot; Jennifer grinned. &quot;This place is like, bare...white and bare.&quot; She sighed. Andrya nodded and started walking back towards the door, which is when Serina came out rubbing her eyes, and looked up to the three of them, and grinned at her sister.<br>
&quot;ANDRYA!!&quot;<br>

&quot;Because, I wanted it to be a surprise, and since your going to be having fun with him, then we might as well introduce him to the rest of the family.&quot; Jennifer said. Andrya rolled her eyes, and turned back to her sister.<br>
&quot;You ran away from home to get to me, how long have you been following us?&quot;<br>
&quot;I dunno, a couple months maybe.&quot;<br>
&quot;Mom must be worried sick about you!&quot;<br>
&quot;Well...I missed you too, not even leaving a note!&quot; Serina yelled back. <br>
&quot;You know how dangerous it is to follow us?!&quot;<br>
&quot;Well...you left me in a house, alone with OUR four brothers!!That's like torture!!&quot; As the sisters argued back and forth Jennifer grinned. She remembered these little fights, she kind of missed them. She smiled and looked over to Jacob, who looked slightly amused and surprised.
