<br>
First Translation From Gibberish [i.e. Not spell/grammar checked] <br>
<br>
1. During the height of the Yellow Kingdom the psychotic minds began performing pilgrimages to neighboring towns. Traveling in pairs of 2-5 missionaries. These groups would walk crawl and flop about the streets spreading insanity with pamphlet and gifs [leaves and rocks they'd picked up on the way] <br>
<br>
2. The people of these towns found them a nuisance and began to fear the Yellow ones; they viewed them as a threat on civilized society. To combat the threat they began killing the yellow ones on sight. <br>
<br>
3. Word quickly spread to The Mad Man Of Yellow who became disturbed. It's hard to disturb a man already over the edge, but his disturbance was great so he met with his top advisors one by one. <br>
<br>
4. He met with The Great Sheep King in their great fields; he traveled to the mountains and spoke with The Goat. He walked the streets until he found The Lead Piper of Yellow and consulted him also. He went shrine to shrine until he found The Fanatic &quot;Path Follower&quot; who's conversation was pointless and accomplished nothing, as Path Follower simply tried to convince The Mad Man Of Yellow that their was no problem because nothing existed. <br>
<br>
5. This did not dampen The Mad Man Of Yellows spirits who then traveled to the ocean and spoke with The Yellow Prophet who believed he was a dolphin. In a very.. &quot;special&quot; way. [www.dolphinsex.com] The Yellow prophet offered advice as best he could. <br>
<br>
6. The Mad Man Of Yellow then traveled even farther down the beaches of the ocean to visit The Squid a man who believed he was a squid. This man confused him further by quoting from old Fireball and Skyline issues.. <br>
<br>
7. Thoroughly confused and unable to think straight, which definitely wasn't anything new. He began wandering until he found himself with his dear friend The Telepathic banana. He consulted his yellow fruit friend who informed him on what he was to do. <br>
<br>
8. On the dawn of the next day The Mad Man Of Yellow announced that he was forming the Yellow Crescent. Which was going to be the militia of the people to eradicate all those who followed the Path of red. <br>
<br>
9. Path of red stood for all those who shed blood in the name of sanity and all things civilized. They where the enemy of The Path Of Yellow because they would not accept the archetypes. All they knew was one archetype and that was the symbol of industry and conforming to secular beliefs. While The Yellow ones respected there right to these beliefs, they would no respect the sacrifice of their people. <br>
<br>
10. So The Yellow Crescent was formed and sent from the Yellow Kingdom to make war with The Path Of Red and all those who belonged to it. Wave after wave of wars ended in stalemates and defeats. <br>
<br>
11. Rumors began spreading amongst the Path of Yellow that they would lose the war. The propaganda grew and spread through out the land. The Yellow Crescent itself began to lose all hope. <br>
<br>
12. Then amongst the people a female spoke out by the name of Joan from the small town of arp. She came before the Mad Man Of Yellow promising victory if he let her lead the Yellow Crescent. She spoke saying &quot;The Telepathic banana has given me a sign that I will lead our people to victory over The Path of Red&quot;. So it was done, Joan Of Arp became the leader of the Yellow Crescent <br>
<br>
--- <br>
<br>
1. Being given full charge over the Yellow Crescent Joan of Arp rallied her forces. She sent the man known as Yellow Prophet home though since he wouldn't stop flopping around like a dolphin. <br>
<br>
2. Her first order was sending The Giant Squid to terrorize the harbors of the Path of Red which he had no problem doing. The Path of Red however was confused as the human recited passages from some book called .. well Orchid something. <br>
<br>
3. During the state of confusion she had Recycled An Animal who was some Fight Club fanatic possibly environmentalist who was pro killing animals so long as you recycled them.. or something lead a small group of environmentalist to kidnap the confused path of red and end this run on sentence. The Run on sentence being ended caused great rejoicing. &quot;Yeah&quot;. <br>
<br>
4. Recycled an animal twitched a few times, suffered 3 seizures and upon recovering did as Joan Of Arp directed and lead a group of Sheep who he thought where crazy people but in fact where the real sheep to attack the path of red. <br>
<br>
5. He was successful in kidnapping them but only after they had laughed at him, ate the three sheep drank a keg of beer and fell asleep drunk. He then returned them and the man who thought he was a squid back to Joan of Arp. This caused much rejoicing and drooling amongst the people. &quot;Yeah&quot;. <br>

Ode To Bananas <br>
By a demon temporarily inhabiting the body of Scott Siskind <br>
<br>
Thy skin is smooth as silken sheets <br>
That grace the beds of kings <br>
As yellow as the noonday sun <br>
Or other yellow things <br>
Thy fruit is filled with subtle taste <br>
Forever quick to please <br>
The favorite of orangutangs <br>
The choice of chimpanzees <br>
Even the peel around thee is <br>
A blessing to us all <br>
We love to throw thee on the floor <br>
And laugh when people fall <br>
<br>
The End<br>
<br>
Copied from a pilgrimage by the famous Path follower a silent fanatic of the faith. <br>

No words are solid, people made them up. No truth can be found, because in order to find truth, one must believe there is a truth. In order to believe there is a Truth, one must presuppose such. Therefore, the presupposition of truth _creates_ truth, and because of such, Truth is not only not findable, but indeed non existant, and a flawed concept from the begininng.<br>

The First War Of Mammals <br>
<br>
First Translation[ie. No spelling or grammar checks yet] <br>
<br>
Book of Preparation Part One <br>
<br>
1. The year is unknown since crazy men seem to either obsesses over time or forget it all together. Those who where so enthralled by the ticking, time tracking devices where pre occupied to inform the other members of the path of yellow. <br>
<br>
2. It was a turbulent time when the many factions in the path of yellow where presence. These factions took the form of animals as their symbols and physical manifestation. While shape shifting seems impossible now.. it may have been possible then.. or at least a bad trip. <br>
<br>
3. Two of the more well known factions are The House Of Sheep and The House of Goats. These two seemingly peaceful animals coexisted for years without distaste for the other house. While the other factions fought wars the two simply ate and crawled on all fours leaping like the crazy people. <br>
<br>
Book of Preparation Part Two <br>
<br>
1. Then The Mad Man Of Yellow published one of his earlier writings &quot;The Great Book of Banana&quot;. While the sheep and those who followed it where all very happy seeing as their leader was represented in this book as The Great Sheep King. The leader of the goats and his followers where not pleased. They felt betrayed by the actions of The Mad Man Of Yellow. So the leader of The House of Goats who was known as &quot;The Goat&quot; began a plot. <br>
<br>
2. This plot was not necessary simply because The Mad Man Of Yellow was insane and had not meant to not include the goat in the storyline however even the sheep believed it was to spite the goat so supported The Mad Man Of Yellow. <br>
<br>
3. The House of Goats could not attack the Mad Man Of Yellow directly as that would be a direct assault on The Path Of Yellow making them an outcast to all other factions of this time. They instead decided to Wage war on the House of sheep. <br>
<br>

<br>
Two Horns Rising <br>
<br>
Book Of War Plans <br>
<br>
1. The Goat climbed to the tip of the mountain, this mountain was home of all The House Of Goats. The Goat stood on the mountain peak and meditated to articulate the proper plan for revenge. <br>
<br>
2. It came to him on the fifth day of meditation. They would storm The House of Sheep on the third day of the seventh week and burn it to the ground and plant banana tree's in the corpses of all the fallen sheep. <br>
<br>
3. The Goat informed all those loyal to the path of yellow and preservation of the Goat species. However one wandering Piper overheard his plot while playing his pipe for money. <br>
<br>
4. He warned The Mad Man Of Yellow who then informed all those loyal to the path of yellow and preservation of insanity. From these people word eventually leaked to the Great Sheep King of the path of yellow. <br>
<br>
5. Nobody said a word and acted like all things where insane and nothing normal would occur. However spies in The House of Sheep informed him of new fortifications and plans for war. He knew then that they knew but that the only way they could know, is if The Mad Man knew and told them. <br>
<br>
Book Of Medication <br>
<br>
1. Twice he had been betrayed by The Mad Man of Yellow.. or so he thought he knew he had but he hadn't known.. or something. <br>
<br>
2. None the less he began a new wave of plots. This time using the foribben medication that causes sanity and clearness of mind. Upon receiving the knowledge that came as thd dizziness faded.. he then truely knew all things sane. <br>
<br>
3. It disturbed him.. it disturbed him greatly and he went mad.. again. During his round of born again insanity he killed a goat that had been used for milking. His people at first ashamed but when they looked into his eyes knew he had taken of the medication of sanity and forgave him. <br>
<br>
4. He took the two small horns from the fallen goat and glued him to his head. He then explained the new plan for the eradication of The House of Sheep. <br>
<br>
5. The House of Goats had then decided a plan that would cause the entire House Of Sheep to suffer as The Goat had and take of the medication of sanity and while in a state of confusion to lay their horned wrath down upon them <br>

<br>
<br>
1. The Sheep where very careful not to mention that they knew the plan. The Goat twice as careful having failed once to keep it secret. They had a spirit of determination about them. <br>
<br>
2. The Sheep slept it was the seventh day of the month and they had five guards watching over the House Of Sheep compound which was a field outside of the great temple. <br>
<br>
3. This night a band of six members of the house of Goat descended on the field, each had a pair of goat horns glued to their heads. The sheep on all fours guarded ready to call the alarm at the first sign of twin horns. <br>
<br>
4. The six came into view and head butted the four sheep by surprise knocking them unconscious. They then spread the powder medication over the field quickly and ran quickly up the fields hopping at random like the infamous mountain goats. <br>
<br>
5. They then hid on the mountain ledge and waited for Dawn. In the morning they would descend on the confused sheep. <br>
<br>

<br>
Subtitle: What the @#%$ <br>
<br>
1. As the house of sheep woke up they went to their regular feeding ground that was now covered with white powder and four sleeping guards. Slightly confused they thought it a sign from heaven. <br>
<br>
2. They began partaking of the powder covered grass eating it and hopping about as sheep do sometimes. They then when full of the psychotropic substance began seeing things clearly. <br>
<br>
3. Their visions corrected.. they now felt very silly as the visions and tranquil feeling of true insanity dripped from their psychotic minds. They began standing up right and walking on two feet still in a slightly confused state. <br>
<br>
4. Then they heard in the background bleeaaah bleeeaah sounds as if a man was pretending he was a Goat. Just then a group of twenty three goat warriors descended upon them head butting them. <br>
<br>
5. The sheep who hadn't partaken of the grass yet stormed into the field with psychic wrath and the two waged war. Many now sane sheep men lay unconscious in the grass while others battled in utter rage with the goats. <br>
<br>
6. The War continued without either sides letting up head butts and sheep kicks filled the fields with bruises and bad headaches. The Goat leader known as &quot;The Goat&quot; called for reinforcements. <br>
<br>
7. More humans with hornes glued to their heads stormed the fields in waves of seventeens. The sheep held their ground battling as fierce as a man on all fours can battle. <br>
<br>
8. As the battle commenced five hours passed and now it seemed everyone was laying on the ground unconscious from head butts and sheep kicking. Slowly they began standing up again wobbling with a bad hang over. <br>
<br>
9. As they stood they noticed each other standing and their rage once again filled them. They gave battle again waging war for another seven hours until they became exhausted and tired. <br>
<br>
10. Sheep and Goat men alike began passing out in the grass from exhaustion and headaches but the war continued with three hour long breaks in between. <br>
<br>
11. Those that had become sane had no coordination on two legs and found themselves quickly overun by the goat during the battle and remained unconscious, never to wake again. <br>
<br>
12. The battles seemed to become shorter and shorter. Goat men and Sheep men began entering deep sleeps never to wage war again. <br>
<br>
13. The war waged on without either side letting up, the morning came and it seemed only sixteen combatants remained and one stranger that had not been fighting but walked upright with a pipe in his hand. <br>
<br>
14. The sixteen became ten two opposing sides and those waged war as the Man who held the pipe came closer his heart full of sorrow for the once great houses now reduced to ten fighting psychos. <br>
<br>
15. The two sets of five became two as the only two men remained. The Great Sheep King and The Goat who both stared at each other over the fallen bodies of their comrades. They met eyes and charged full speed at one another. <br>
<br>
16. The heads crashing was like a thunderous clap.. or maybe more like two heads hitting.. it was loud though. They both fell to the ground dizzy and unable to stand until they collapsed into a mess on the ground. <br>
<br>
17. The Man with the pipe was now very sad and looked over the bodies strewn out across the field and could do nothing for them. So he began playing his pipe. He was a Piper and his pipe was made of lead. <br>
<br>
18. He piped on his pipe the way pipers do with lead pipes until he could pipe no more. Upon finishing his song he decided to pipe some more for the dead even though he could no longer pipe he tried again and again. <br>
<br>
19. His lead piping did not go unnoticed the telepathic banana heard his melody that was for the fallen psychotics. While the Telepathic Banana rarely influenced world affairs instead having those do his deeds decided it was time. <br>
<br>
20. The telepathic banana dropped a banana from the sky that fell like.. a banana on to the head of the lead piper. Upon hitting him on the head the lead piper was blessed in a way that only the telepathic banana could bless people... with bananas. <br>
<br>
21. The Pipers pipe though lead turned yellow and his song spread through the fields and his countenance shined down on those around him. He piped and piped some more and the melody began healing all the fallen Goats and Sheep. <br>
<br>
22. Slowly one by one the goats and sheep woke from their sleep that no man should wake from less he have an awful headache.. and they did. The pipers melody slowly eased their headaches and pains. Confused and the weird man with a yellow pipe they decided not to continue fighting at this time. <br>
<br>
23. The Telepathic banana then sent a message to all those involved. That this Lead Piper would now be known as The Lead Piper Of Yellow as he was truly insane for feeling sad for The House of Goat, and The House of Sheep. Thus ended the first war of mammals.<br>
<br>
The Path of Yellow Exposed <br>
<br>
<br>
The path of yellow though comical invites us to look at the fundamental truths inherit in all religions. The symbol used known, as &quot;The Telepathic Banana&quot; is a phallic symbol. It is a symbol of power and like a church steeple pointing towards heaven. The fruit itself is tropical and exotic eventually made popular in some macronations due to large plantation and free trade. The banana symbol is also yellow and yellow has been an archetype representing power like the blazing fire of god in other cultures. The fact that it is telepathic and can transcend language makes it increasingly god like in it's perspective. <br>
<br>
In the hero’s archetypal journey the hero always loses something that is never recovered and gains something instead. The story creates a full circle completing the hero’s journey. He begins as a normal wanderer as profession; he then looses his mind from dehydration and is then faced with an adversary that he confronts to find what he was lacking. Having this newfound knowledge he begins to spread the word. <br>
<br>
Once he creates the nation another full circle is spent as he is forced to abandon it with his partner forever leaving behind his past world but gaining a New World. This completes the hero's journey archetype but leaves another chapter to be written. <br>
<br>
The triangle is a repeating archetype having three sides of equal sides. Making it a powerful symbol for the subconscious mind. The triangle is used through out history to show places of worship a power. This power is sometimes represented as someone’s life’s work and a tribute to the gods such as the pyramids. <br>
<br>
The number three and the number five are both archetypes. The fact that these numbers are written shows that the original author was subject to the inner archetypes of man, a strong connection with universal unconscious mind. <br>
<br>
The image of the man on all fours represents the primal nature of human kind. The mans ability to speak both the language of a sheep and humans must imply the foundation of evolution. The sheep’s conversation from a four-legged archetypal follower into a member and leader in the path of yellow implies that some initiation process occurred. That the man went through steps accordingly to his status in the triangle. <br>
<br>
Since so many books are lost and have yet to be recovered and translated scholars must wait patiently for this dynamic faith to unfold to the public. Lets just hope their insanity has worn off enough for them to provide an accurate account of The Path of Yellows history.<br>
<br>
The Endrathdelmarta <br>
<br>
<br>
1. The Man walked the beaches with no goal in life. He walked, and he would walk all day and all night with little rest, and no thought. He would look at his surroundings, and when he would turn away from them, he would forget what they where, and that he ever traveled them... <br>
<br>
2. Then, one day he stumbled upon a herd of sheep grazing in a somewhat hidden valley. This valley was glorious, filled with much grass, and many springs of sparkly blue water. He watched them for several hours, and was so captivated, that these hours turned to days, and then to several weeks. <br>
<br>
3. He noted the way they lived life, carefree, or seemingly so, and how they did as they wished, when they wished. He yearned to live like them, and attempted to do so with them. Doing so got him very wild, and crazed. After several days of extreme insanity, he had a dream. The leader of the herd, the mysterious talking sheep spoke to him, the sheep asked him questions about his life. What his goals where, and why he lived the way he did... The man had no true answer. He then, was inspired to think, and stewed for several days upon the question &quot;Why anything?&quot; <br>
<br>
4. He then decided he must go on a journey, a journey to find himself. On this sacred journey, he would bring along the Herd Leader, his new mentor/guide. He marched on with the sheep for several months and several wild hallucinations. All of them, pointing to one direction, and all of them involving the same mysterious yellow light. He traveled the sands of many small islands where he saw his past, present, and likely future. Only glimpses of each, where seen. After leaving the small islands, they found a larger island... <br>
<br>
5. This island was bathed in Soothing yellow light in one specific area, the wanderer’s destination. When he finally came upon the spot, he saw something he couldn’t believe, a lone banana amid a clearing. This banana seemed to be the cause of this light, and it spoke to him... &quot;Young man, you're journey to find yourself has brought you to me, and within me, you will find the path to yourself.&quot; The man walked over to the banana, and attempted to pick it up, he was unable to do so. And the banana vanished, along with the sheep. He then walked the beaches, confused, and angry for 5 days, when seemingly out of no where, he met a man, The Madman Of Yellow, then at that moment, he had a vision of a great temple, a magnificent city, and a powerful nation. <br>
<br>
Sidenote: Now from the location the man saw the banana, our 'Temple Of Radiance' resides.<br>
<br>
The History Of The Yellow Ones <br>
<br>
<br>
Much of the history the banana has been lost due to insanity of its members. Most scholars have avoided dealing with the walking mad men. The little known comes from the first few books, the following books written in strange characters and pages of gibberish and scribble are our language only to the those who follow the path of yellow. <br>
<br>
We do know however that large pyramids where once build dedicated to their worship and practice, the members ranged in the hundreds. When sane missionaries came the viewed it as an abomination and began persecuting the Path of Yellow. <br>
<br>
The persecution went on four years until most members had been killed in temple filled blooth baths. The sane ones where known to the followers as The Path of Red from those days forth. Most followers where dispersed all that remained of one psychotic following was the the original triangle. The Telepathic Banana, The Mad Man of Yellow, and The Great Sheep King of Yellow. <br>
<br>
They sent out to find a land to avoid religious prosecution, hoping to escape the path of red. They found land east of Menelmacar and settled here so that they could be near a democracy. They then built the Temple of Radiance and the first banana plantation to spread the joy of the path of yellow. <br>
<br>
The final paragraph is not needed to explain the history, it is needed to fuffill the law of archetypes. Four is not an archetype, three however is but four paragraphs are needed to tell the story. So this paragraph has been added to create a fifth paragraph, because five is an archetype.<br>
<br>
The Great book of Banana <br>
The Circle of Banana <br>
<br>
<br>
Book of Plantation <br>
<br>
1. Born to a small tribe the man began to wander. He walked along the beach where the oceans hits the sand. After many days he became dehydrated and dellusional, thus began the visions from our Lord. <br>
<br>
2. As he walked fighting the hallucinations and random voices, one voice in particular stood out amongst the myriad of whispering voices. It came from a near by banana plantation, so the wanderer walked towards the strange sound. <br>
<br>
3. Upon entering the banana plantation he found that it was over run by palms and monkies. He then viewed a monkey small but upon first glance he realized, it was pure evil. It was sent her by some unkown force to kill the voice he heard. <br>
<br>
4. Then the voice which stood out so clear, spoke to his mind again. &quot;Save me and I shall guide you!&quot;. His eyes looked to see a banana laying on the ground and the monkey standing over it's body. So the mad wanderer charged the evil monkey. <br>
<br>
5. The monkey suprised at the intrusion on it's banana plantation fled as the wanderer snatched the banana from the ground. The wanderer then ran from the plantation to the beach. <br>
<br>
Book of Yellow <br>
<br>
1. Then spoke the banana to the wanderers mind. &quot;I am the banana.&quot; and the wanderer felt the power of the mighty banana. The wanderer was puzzled by this dilema, even mad he was skeptical of this fruit. <br>
<br>
2. &quot;How can you speak to me?&quot; asked the mad wanderer. As he said these words a fisherman walked past with his daily catch. Sarcasticly answered for the banana, &quot;Maybe it's telepathic&quot;? The fisherman then laughed and walked on. <br>
<br>
3. So the banana became known as the telepathic one. The yellow banana seemed to look at the psychotic mad man through its sun yellow skin. &quot;I said I shall guide you.&quot; spoke the fruit in his hands. &quot;I shall show you the blazing glory of the might one in an hour yet to come.&quot; With those words the sun finally set and night fell upon them. <br>
<br>
4. The banana then told the wanderer to stay awake all night and he would see his blazing glory of yellow. So began the night of waiting. The mad man sat on the beach and watched the waves crash upon the shore all night. The banana was silent during this time in deep meditation. <br>
<br>
5. The mad man watched the east shore waiting for the power of the banana to be revealed. It then in the early morning happened, the sky lit up and light covered the entire sky as the sun rose over the hill. This brilliant ball of fire must be what the banana ment by his blazing glory. <br>
<br>
Book of Triangles <br>
<br>
1. Upon his realization of the great power of the banana the wanderer listened for three days and three nights to the banana speak. Those words can not be written for they are sacred to the banana and his new follower. <br>
<br>
2. The banana then appointed the insomniac mad wanderer to be called the The Mad Man Of Yelllow. The man man of yellow was also appointed the first missionary of the banana. To walk always in the path of yellow and seek out and convert other mad men. <br>
<br>
3. While he walked down the shores he noticed a man walking on all fours. &quot;Why are you walking on all fours?&quot; Ask the Mad Man of Yellow. &quot;Why are you talking to a Banana baaaaah.&quot; Replied the man on all fours. <br>
<br>
4. So the two sat and thought about both of those questions together. The Man Sheep, and The Mad Man Of Yellow finally came to the conclusion that they where the only sane people on the planet. With that epiphany the banana spoke saying &quot;The man sheep will also from this day forth be a preist of yellow.&quot; Thus The Man Sheep became known as, The Great Sheep King of Yellow. <br>
<br>
5. With this new alliance of three creatures created the first triangle relationship. They went forth spreading the path of yellow and insanity. Thus fufilled the law of archetypes the three books, of five verses.<br>
