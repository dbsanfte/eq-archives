Can someone help me find it...Please!!!!!<br>
<br>
Dh wants to move us to Kentucky, expecting me to teach there.  I went online to see it there were any jobs, and found none.  Come to find out through his family there, they don't advertise or fly their openings, they hire by word of mouth through people they know.<br>
<br>
Now, that's not some place I want to work and it's not the way I'd want to be hired.  Dh isn't getting it, so I need the law as proof.<br>
<br>
I told him if I (or he) sent my resume down, it would have to be accompanied by a law suit for unfair hiring practices. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
In AZ there are hardly advertisements for teaching either if memory serves and things haven't changed too much in the last 8 years or so, but you put your resume/application in at each district and get the screening interview then see about a follow up. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come to find out through his family there, they don't advertise or fly their openings, they hire by word of mouth through people they know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Companies can be as formal as they want to, and yes many may get hired through job fairs and blind resumes, but I hardly know anyone hired this way anywhere. Sad truth is most of us are referred or have a friend or relative at whatever place we are now working. Not to say it gets you the job, but it definitely gets you the interview. <br>
<br>
&quot;I told him if I (or he) sent my resume down, it would have to be accompanied by a law suit for unfair hiring practices.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what you mean here, but I'm hoping the copy of the law suit is for dh and not a prospective employer. You would find yourself weeded out very swiftly officially or no if ya did that<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Only thing I can recommend is sweeping all the districts in which you wish to work and make as many contacts as you can through family and when you move there. Plus you don't know how much stock to put in dh's family's assessment, maybe there are folks getting hired off the street and they just don't know it. Either way, I don't think the law will help much since you can't use it unless you can prove you were slighted or denied and that is EXTREMELY difficult, especially if you don't yet have an interview. People in my company get jobs all the time that are never even posted or were posted as a gesture only--they already knew who they were going to take (dh benefitted from this just recently himself).<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>know</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> they have to fly job listings somewhere.  I'm already certified to teach, have taught here in Vegas for 7 yrs before I retired and I'm coming out of retirement.<br>
<br>
I know people get hired all the time by contacts (I am assured a teaching job here through contacts), but they must fly the job before they can even interview.  They have to accept applications from others, and do the interview process.  They can't interview before the postition is flown... a whole bunch of things.  It's in the unfair hiring practice clause in some law somewhere.<br>
<br>
Every job I will get call to interview for here has been &quot;flown&quot;.  If they don't fly it, the can't hire for it.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm off to call my lawyer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If it isn't a federal statute protecting it then it falls upon the state laws.  I was further unable to locate a Kentucky statute requiring the posting either.  I searched the case history as well and aside from some workers comp and sexual harassment cases there isn't anything I could locate pertaining to teaching in KY and required advertising.  Perhaps the flying of positions is a Nevada thing and KY doesn't have a similar statute, or perhaps they have a similar statute with a less stringent policy like a bulletin board at the school itself...<br>
<br>
On a side note, I found it interesting that the Board of Ed in KY was immune from suit for permitting a sexual harassment offendor to operate for 16 years unpunished in their school district despite numerous complaints.  When sued they claimed Sovreign Immunity and dismissed all the charges.<br>
