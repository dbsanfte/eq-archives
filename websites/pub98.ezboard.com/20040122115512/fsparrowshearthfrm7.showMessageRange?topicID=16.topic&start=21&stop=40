How many UN mandates has Israel ignored?<br>

From Charlie:<br>
You tell me, Jeff. <br>

You might also want to enumerate all the UN mandates, including the Oslo accords, the Palestinians have ignored and are still ignoring.  Their leader is cut from the same piece of cloth as Saddam Hussein.<br>

<br>
It is quite obvious that U.N. resolutions against Israel outnumber those against Palestine (or the P.L.O. or Palestinians in general) for the main reason that most U.N. resolutions are against nations and governments.  The Palestinians have no nation to speak of at this time, their &quot;government&quot; is technically in exile and the P.L.O only has observer status at the U.N.  Resolutions against such a nebulous entity can be difficult to enforce.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding that previous fact, the Palestinians have resisted Resolutions 242 and 338 as well as the Oslo accord.  I tried to find other resolutions they resisted, but I could not find any others.<br>
<br>
Israel has resisted approximately 65 resolutions from 1955 to 1992.  Another 20 resolutions from 1993 to 1995 passed by the General Assembly have been resisted, but as these are only General Assembly resolutions, they are not binding anyway.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the U.S. has VETOed approximately 34 Security Council resolutions against Israel from 1972 to the present.<br>

Agreed.  Neither side is without sin.  I won't get into a which is worse debate comparing suicide bombings of buses filled with innocents to things like an air raid bombing of an apartment building to kill a Hamas leader that also killed innocents.  Both are reprehensible.<br>

<br>
I sit corrected.  The books of the Maccabees are not of NT but of OT times.  However that are not apart of the OT in the KJV, and other Bibles, because they were not considered to be part of the Old Testament by the Jews, themselves.<br>
<br>
As to the canonicity of the New Testament books, they were established by Peter and John.  I am not about to reproduce two chapters of a book, Jeff, sorry about that.  However, if you wish to research it yourself the writings of Eusibius, the early Christian historian/librarian, would be helpful.  He was instrumental in maintaining and distributing copies of the original texts until they were put into codex form.  <br>
<br>
There are still copies of the oringinal writings, in Greek, which are are the basis for all the New Testament translations extant today.  <br>
<br>
You have your head in the sand, Jeff, if you think all the OT prophecies have been fulfilled.  They have not!<br>
-------<br>
Thank you, Esdras, for your informative post on the matter of UN sanctions and such.  It is appreciated.<br>
<br>
I think we could see the covenant that is to be confirmed for seven years come about as a result of the current peace initiative, even if the Palestian terror militias swear they will not stop until Israel is driven into the sea.<br>
<br>
That, to my mind, is why Luke 21:36 is of extreme importance for believers today.  We can see these things beginning to come to pass.<br>

You may want to check out the history of the King James Version of the Bible.  The original version first printed in 1611 included the following Table of Contents:<br>

As you can see in the link, the first two books of Maccabees are included in the original KJV.<br>

I will grant that they are in the Apocrypha in the KJV as opposed to deuterocanonical status, but they are in the KJV nonetheless. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

In fact a festival that the Gospel of John refers to in John 10:22, which came from somewhere and that is the story found in Maccabees.<br>
You may want to ask yourself if the Canon was closed, how is it the great Codex Sinaiticus;4th century; has books of Epistle of Barnabas and most of the Shepherd of Hermas. <br>
Eusebius of Caesarea d. ~340 CE on the Canon; it is interesting to see that the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Apocalypse of John</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is still in despute at his time.<br>
 <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>At this point it seems appropriate to summarize the writings of the New Testament which have already been mentioned. In the first place must be put the holy quaternion of the Gospels, which are followed by the book of the Acts of the Apostles. <br>
<br>
After this must be reckoned the Epistles of Paul; next in order the extant former Epistle of John, and likewise the Epistle of Peter must be recognized. After these must be put, if it really seems right, the Apocalypse of John, concerning which we shall give the different opinions at the proper time. <br>
<br>
[disputed]<br>
These, then, [are to placed] among the recognized books. Of the disputed books, which are nevertheless familiar to the majority, there are extant the Epistle of James, as it is called; and that of Jude; and the second Epistle of Peter; and those that are called the Second and Third of John, whether they belong to the evangelist or to another of the same name. <br>
<br>
[spurious]<br>
Among the spurious books must be reckoned also the Acts of Paul, and the Shepherd, as it is called, and the Apocalypse of Peter; and, in addition to these, the extant Epistle of Barnabas, and the Teaching of the Apostles [Didache] , as it is called. And, in addition, as I said, the Apocalypse of John, if it seems right. (This last as I said, is rejected by some, but others count it among the recognized books.) And among these some have counted also the Gospel of the Hebrews, with which those of the Hebrews who have accepted Christ take a special pleasure.<br>
<br>
[heretical]<br>
Now all these would be among the disputed books; but nevertheless we have felt compelled to make this catalogue of them, distinguishing between those writings which, according to the tradition of the Church, are true and genuine and recognized, from the others which differ from them in that they are not canonical, but disputed, yet nevertheless are known to most churchmen. [And this we have done] in order that we might be able to know both these same writings and also those which the heretics put forward under the name of the apostles; including, for instance, such books as the Gospels of Peter, of Thomas, of Matthias, or even of some others besides these, and the Acts of Andrew and John and the other apostles. To none of these has any who belonged to the succession of ecclesiastical writers ever thought it right to refer in his writings. <br>
<br>
Moreover, the character of the style also is far removed from apostolic usage, and the thought and purport of their contents are completely out of harmony with true orthodoxy and clearly show themselves that they are the forgeries of heretics. For this reason they ought not to be reckoned among the spurious books, but are to be cast aside as altogether absurd and impious.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
The Canon of the New Testament was not firmed up until around 397 AD with the Council of Carthage.<br>

I know the History of the Canon and know that it was in a flux when the West and East finally accepted what is know today as the New Testament.  The East wanted Hebrews and the West wanted the Apocalypse of John.  It was the Church in the first 400 years that established the Canon.  And it was after the publication of the Nicene Creed that it was finalized.<br>

What Jews one may ask?  It was Jewish folk that translated and produced the LXX, the text that the Gospel writers used.  It was Jewish folk at the Council of Jamnia in the mid 90's AD that formed the so called Jewish Canon, in face of the Christian use of the LXX. <br>

<br>
Re. your post no. 24 you state:  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You may want to ask yourself if the Canon was closed, how is it the great Codex Sinaiticus;4th century; has books of Epistle of Barnabas and most of the Shepherd of Hermas.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I have done so, Jeff, and concluded those books were initially included because Constantine wanted them included.  It was he who 'commissioned' the preparation of the codex.  To the best of my knowledge they were not part of the work done by Eusibius on Constantine's behalf.<br>
<br>
If you should have evidence that it was so, from Eusibius writings, that is, it would help if you were to identify in which of them the evidence appears.<br>
<br>
I think subsequent disputes between the Greek Catholic Church and the Roman Catholic Church led to many changes.  Changes that, for the most part, were motivated by the biases of the leaders of the two opposing factions.  Each group had their own biases, just as your leaders are biased against Israel and you follow their dictates.<br>
<br>
From Jeff:<br>
&quot;The Canon of the New Testament was not firmed up until around 397 AD with the Council of Carthage.&quot;<br>
<br>
From Charlie:<br>
There were complete copies of the New Testament in circulation before that time, Jeff, that were arranged canonically but Constantine wanted to rearrange the order of the books, and did change some to the original texts,  to suit his 'state church' concept.  A Church that would be under the dictates of the State.  The present day Vatican is a church state, completely autonomous from other states.<br>
<br>
The Roman Church leaders wanted it one way, the Greek Church leaders wanted it another way, and the true canon was lost in the shuffle because those who were following usin the New Testament as originally written in the order in which they were arranged, were loving their neighbors as themselves rather than trying to make a name for themselves.<br>
<br>
Your leaders are trying to make a name for themselves, today.  They are not alone, every denomination is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>led by</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> men who are driven by a desire to dictate.<br>
<br>
The Bible tells us, in Romans 10:9,<br>
<br>
&quot;If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.&quot;<br>
<br>
Only God knows what anyone believes in their heart, Jeff!  Believers are not to forsake the gathering of themselves together to worship the Lord but they are not required to do is as part of any particular church.<br>
<br>
Jesus said, where two or three are gathered together in my name I am in the midst of them.  That is what counts!!!<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts.<br>

<br>
Thank you for your post no. 26.<br>
<br>
It so happens that the Church I attend is a non-denoiminatial church.  Anyone who confesses with their mouth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and is prepared to examine themselves before taking part of the bread and the wine, is welcome to do so.<br>
<br>
The leader of our group does not ask people to make that confession nor do we know who has or who has not judged their own worthiness when we, as a group, partake of the bread and the wine.  God knows and we leave the discernment and judgment up to Him.<br>
<br>
From Jeff:<br>
In 400 AD there was one Church, and the heretics. Just as your leaders see no wrong that Israel can do and follow their dictates makes the same sense, do you not agree? Israel has nothing to do with the formation of the Canon, so why you insert that in this is beyond me. <br>
<br>
From Charlie:<br>
<br>
There were churches in the houses of people for many years, Jeff, before the 'church' became oganized.  When it did there were at least 7 separate branches of the church, in the seven cities to whom the messages to the seven churches are addressed.  They did not all become part of the one Church, of which you speak, whatever it was, in 400 AD.<br>
<br>
The leader of the 'church' I attend does see that Israel can, and still does.  They reject Jesus as the Son of God, for one thing.  Your accusation is illfounded, I am afraid.<br>
<br>
The priests of Israel most certainly played a roll in establishing the canon of the OT, Jeff.  I said nothing about them doing so with respect to the NT.<br>
<br>
From Jeff:<br>
As I pointed out there was only One Church. Ok where is your proof of that statement, name names, who were those who followed the New Testament in the order in which they were arranged, what early Church writings attest to that? Who was trying to make a name for themselves and name names and sources.<br>
<br>
As long as you insist there was only One Church, in those early days, and as long as you insist your Church is the One Church of today, we will never settle anything, Jeff.  <br>
<br>
God is the only one who knows what anyone believes in their heart so He is the only one who knows who is a 'Christian' and eligble to be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass.  <br>
<br>
Just my thoughts.<br>

I'll believe what Our Lord told John and recorded by John, for our enlightenment, Jeff, in Rev. 1:19-20<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks.

<br>
These were seven separate churches, Jeff, each represented by a candlestick and each with its own angel. <br>
------<br>
As to Luke 21:36, those were words of Our Lord, Jeff, as were the words of Matt.24:12-13.  Luke did not make them up any more that did Matthew.<br>
<br>
From Jeff:<br>
A Christian would welcome Martyrdom and the Baptism of Blood.<br>
<br>
From Charlie:<br>
Anyone who is not accounted worthy to escape all these things will suffer martyrdom, Jeff.  Those who are alive and remain, of I Thess.4:16-17 and I Cor.15:51-58, at the time the bodies of the dead in Christ rise, will not suffer martyrdom - according to the scriptures.<br>
<br>
In fact, Jeff, they will not suffer death but their corruptible bodies will be changed into incorruptible bodies in the twinkling of an eye and, for them, death will be defeated.  I Cor.15:54<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

It you wish not to be accounted worthy to escape all these things you could get your wish.  <br>

P.S.  Ignatius of Antioch may have been ordained by the Apostle John, appointed, not doubt, as a bishop.  I do not know, Jeff.

7 Churches meant one church in one city, not 7 sects but these churches were all in communion with the Apostles so it was one Church.  Have you ever thought about what Our Lord was praying for in John 17?  Was he praying for thousands of sects?<br>
If you are saying that St Igantius did not know what he was talking about then how on earth would anyone believe John Nelson Darby's new Gospel which is totally at odds with anything that came before.  It is not the faith once delivered to the saints.  St Ignatius was during the New Testament so he knew what the Apostle's taught.<br>
But it was folks like St Ignatius that preserved for you the New Testament and therefore he was inspired to pick the right tradition.<br>

As St Vincent of Lerins (+450AD) says below there are rules one must follow when reading the Scripture, otherwise novel doctrines and heresies are rampant and each person reading the Scripture comes up with a different meaning.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But here some one perhaps will ask, Since the canon of Scripture is complete, and sufficient of itself for everything, and more than sufficient, what need is there to join with it the authority of the Church's interpretation? For this reason, - because, owing to the depth of Holy Scripture, all do not accept it in one and the same sense, but one understands its words in one way, another in another; so that it seems to be capable of as many interpretations as there are interpreters. For Novatian expounds it one way, Sabellius another, Donatus another, Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius, another, Photinus, Apollinaris, Priscillian, another, Iovinian, Pelagius, Celestius, another, lastly, Nestorius another. Therefore, it is very necessary, on account of so great intricacies of such various error, that the rule for the right understanding of the prophets and apostles should be framed in accordance with the standard of Ecclesiastical and Catholic interpretation. <br>
Moreover, in the Catholic Church itself, all possible care must be taken, that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all. For that is truly and in the strictest sense &quot;Catholic,&quot; which, as the name itself and the reason of the thing declare, comprehends all universally. This rule we shall observe if we follow universality, antiquity, consent. We shall follow universality if we confess that one faith to be true, which the whole Church throughout the world confesses; antiquity, if we in no wise depart from those interpretations which it is manifest were notoriously held by our holy ancestors and fathers; consent, in like manner, if in antiquity itself we adhere to the consentient<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
Mr Baker:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Roman Church leaders wanted it one way, the Greek Church leaders wanted it another way, and the true canon was lost in the shuffle because those who were following usin the New Testament as originally written in the order in which they were arranged, were loving their neighbors as themselves rather than trying to make a name for themselves.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I have quite enough occupy my mind with in what is written in the Bible.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I asked you to name names and sources of who was trying to make names for themselves?  So, you have been reading other books besides the Bible, and I would bet that it was a dispensationalist and he got his stuff from Darby and Cyrus Scofield.<br>

<br>
You have asked for scriptures that have led me to my conclusions.<br>
<br>
First there are the promises of land to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as well as the promises of a future, for Israel, contained in Isaiah, Jermiah, and Ezekiel, that have still to be fulfilled.<br>
<br>
There are the prophecies in Daniel about the Israelites, that have never been fulfilled.<br>
<br>
Daniel has a number of rather detailed prophecies, Jeff, stating with the 70 weeks (of years) and ending with Daniel 12:11 and 12.  Some have been fulfilled and some not.  It is the ones that have not been fulfilled that interest me.<br>
<br>
Then there are the prophecies of Zepheniah and Zechariah, along with the fill-in prophecies of the minor prophets.<br>
<br>
These all tell of an endtimes, latter day, future for Israel in the Holy Land.  Prophecies that have not yet been fulfilled. <br>
<br>
We then have the prophecies given to us by Our Lord relating to believers, both Jew and Gentile, most of which are still to be fulfilled including I Thess.4:16:17 and I Cor.15:51-52.<br>
<br>
These last are remarkable prophecies, Jeff.  Prophecies that believers should be wondering about and pondering on because they have not been fulfilled, yet, but they will be!  I believe God's word, you see. <br>
<br>
Finally there are the prophecies of the Revelation of Jesus Christ starting with the messages to the 7 churches.  Once I was introduced to what the Bible holds in store, by some men who have explored its vast reaches themselves, I began exploring it for my self.  <br>
<br>
If you cannot accept my sincerity, I can do nothing about it.  I am sorry you do not see things as I do but you must study the Bible for yourself.  No one else can do it for you.  <br>
<br>
Don't take any man's word for anything, Jeff, regarding the Bible that is. Check it out for yourself!  The Bible, that is, not books that are not a recognized canonized part of it.<br>
<br>
Rev. 22:18-19 merit very careful consideration, in this respect, Jeff:  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Many limit the application of that warning to the last book of the Bible but I am convinced it applies to the whole book, the Bible itself.<br>
<br>
God's word it truth!  Those who worhsip Him, must worship Him in spirit and in truth.  John 4:23-24<br>
<br>
God Bless you.

It did not fall out of the sky in bonded leather.  <br>
As I pointed out Daniel was written in 165 BC and it was an Apoclypse and the 70 weeks were talking about things that were taking place when he wrote it.  <br>
I have read and there is nothing at all to support dispensationalism, and that is where it stands, it comes from Darby, Scofield, Lindsey, and now in the latest fiction of Jenkins.  <br>
Why is it that when it comes to sola scriptura there are thousands of sects claiming they all read the Bible as the only authority but do not agree?  Who taught your teachers?  Where did their dispensationalism come from?<br>
