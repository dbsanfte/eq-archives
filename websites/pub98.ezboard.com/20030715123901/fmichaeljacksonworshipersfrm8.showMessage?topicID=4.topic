<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Day 4---<br>
I was just waking up and i notced that Michael was starring at me.<br>
&quot;good morning&quot;<br>
&quot;good morning to you to&quot; i said sleeply.<br>
&quot;i have to go home tomorrow&quot;<br>
&quot;why? can't you stay?&quot;<br>
&quot;no, i wish though&quot;<br>
We just talked all day and were very sad because this would be the last day i got to see him and he got to see me. He would be far to busy to call me or anything. I was getting more sadder then ever before, i didn't want<br>
him to go i wanted him to stay. I knew was not gong to be able to go so<br>
i just got more sad.<br>
&quot;i'll miss you Michael&quot; i said very sadly<br>
&quot;yeah, i'll miss you to&quot;<br>
&quot;well i better get going you probably have things to do and stuff&quot;<br>
&quot;nope i get to relax today, then tomorrow i go back and all that&quot;<br>
&quot;oh but i should maybe go anyway&quot;<br>
&quot;you can stay, you could keep me company&quot;<br>
:&quot;then i would be bugging you and.............&quot; he cut me off.<br>
&quot;your perfectly fine, i would love for you to stay&quot;<br>
&quot;ok if you want&quot;<br>
&quot;you seemed pretty scared last night while watching the movie&quot;<br>
&quot;no i wasn't, you were&quot;<br>
&quot;then why were you hidding?&quot;<br>
&quot;because i wanted to&quot;<br>
We talked on and on and on about the movie and on what we were doing<br>
it was fun. I even asked him what he was going to do when he got back <br>
to Neverland.<br>
&quot;so you gonna miss me when your gone?&quot;<br>
&quot;yes, most definitly&quot;<br>
&quot;why?&quot;<br>
&quot;because i like to be with you&quot;<br>
&quot;no you don't&quot;.<br>
We kept laughing and laughing also. I was just shocked and stuff when he said he wanted to be with me. <br>
&quot;what about you? you going to miss me when i leave&quot;<br>
&quot;more then you know Michael, i will just have to cry for you leaving&quot;<br>
&quot;i don't want you to be sad&quot;<br>
&quot;well i am&quot;<br>
I then got up out of bed and walked in to the bathroom and grabbed my brush out of my purse and brushed my hair then got my stuff ready.<br>
&quot;thanks for everything&quot;<br>
&quot;you leaving?&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah, and i am going to miss you&quot;<br>
&quot;do you just want to go some where? i mean it is my last day&quot;<br>
&quot;you sure you really want to?&quot;<br>
&quot;yes i am sure&quot;<br>
&quot;ok, where we going?&quot;<br>
&quot;any where you want&quot;<br>
I then was thinking of where we could go, it was a tuff decsion. I really was going to miss Michael, he was willing to spend his last day with me<br>
and i thought he was really sweet. <br>
&quot;lets go eat first&quot;<br>
&quot;ok, sounds good to me&quot;<br>
We went to Burger King and got some burgers we sat outside to eat them<br>
and talked more, i felt like i knew him better then i did before. He told me things i never knew. It was just so fun. It was finally getting dark and <br>
Michael was a gentle men and took me home. At the door we didn't say much, just gave each other a kiss on the cheek and a hug then i started to<br>
cry once he started to leave.<br>
...........................................................................................................................<br>
Day 5---<br>
It was finally time for Michael to leave, i was just happy to get to know him better and he let me actually be with him the rest of his stay. He was<br>
finally at the airport, everyone was there and watching him take of, they were missing him to. I went right to the airport with my friends and i ran<br>
right up to Michael, everyone was shocked but i didn't care. he was my friend and we both understood each other. I gave Michael one last hug.<br>
I even was crying while hugging him, i felt like i was loosing a new best friend.<br>
&quot;I love you&quot;<br>
&quot;i love you to Michael&quot;<br>
&quot;it'll be ok, don't cry&quot;<br>
&quot;i feel like i am loosing my friend&quot;<br>
&quot;we will always be friends, don't worrie&quot;<br>
&quot;but i will never see you again&quot;<br>
&quot;yes you will&quot;<br>
&quot;when?&quot;<br>
&quot;i don't know but i promise to be back&quot;<br>
Everyone then kind of pulled him away from me, i just broke down in to more tears. I felt like i was never going to see him again, i know we only<br>
knew each other for a few days or a little bit more but it was hard. My<br>
friends were hugging me and giving me suport to help me and to try to make me feel better, Michael blew me one last kiss and that was the last time i saw him. For the rest of that day i hung with my friends, no matter what Michael stayed in my head and i tryed to get him out. Everything<br>
was reminding me of him. My friends and I went to a club for a while.<br>
&quot;Tia, you'll see him again&quot; my friend Amanda said.<br>
&quot;yeah, he probably misses you alot right now&quot; Kirsten said.<br>
&quot;i bet he is thinking about you right now&quot; Destiny said.<br>
&quot;no, i bet not&quot; i told them.<br>
&quot;Tia, trust us you WILL see him again&quot; Emily said.<br>
I could not believe a word they said. I just sat there being bored and all of the sudden i see the guy i met at the mall walking up to me.<br>
&quot;hi&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;hi&quot;<br>
&quot;you wanna dance?&quot;<br>
&quot;no thanks, i am feeling alittle down right now&quot;<br>
&quot;ok you sure?&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah, i am sorry though&quot;<br>
&quot;it's alright&quot;<br>
Then he walked off looking mad but i didn't care, not like i was planning <br>
on seeing him again now. The only person i wanted to see was Michael.<br>
Each time i thought of him, my crying got worse and worse each time.<br>
...........................................................................................................................<br>
Day 6---<br>
Michael was off at home doing his own thing. He had a hard time trying to have fun, all he could think about was me. He did go one rides and<br>
played with kids all day, Michael also had weird feelings and he didn't<br>
know what it was. He never felt the way he is before, it was the feeling<br>
of desire and more. He just couldn't figure it out. I on the other hand just wanted to see him again, no i didn't have the same feeling i just missed him because he was a good friend the whole time we were together. And<br>
the whole day i was wondering what he could be doing. Later i got my<br>
mind off of him and on to something eles. <br>
...........................................................................................................................<br>
Two weeks later..................Day 20 (skip 14 days)<br>
...........................................................................................................................<br>
Day 20---<br>
I was just getting out of the shower and my phone rang,<br>
&quot;hello?&quot; i asked.<br>
&quot;hey it's Michael&quot;<br>
&quot;oh hey i missed you!!&quot; i said excitedly.<br>
&quot;i missed you more&quot;<br>
&quot;so what have you been up to?&quot;<br>
&quot;i have just been thinking...&quot;<br>
&quot;thinking about what?&quot;<br>
&quot;i have been thinking maybe we should see each other again..&quot;<br>
&quot;i would love to see you again!&quot;<br>
&quot;if i sent you a plain ticket there, would you be able to come?&quot;<br>
&quot;oh, Michael i don't know...............&quot;<br>
&quot;i really want to see you again&quot;<br>
&quot;i know and i want to see you to but i have school still&quot;<br>
&quot;not even for a week?&quot;<br>
&quot;i can try and ask but it would only have to be a week&quot;<br>
&quot;ok just let me know, i really miss you&quot;<br>
&quot;i miss you to&quot;. i said while laughing because he repeated himself.<br>
&quot;well sweetie i have to go&quot;<br>
&quot;ok Michael, i love you!&quot;<br>
&quot;i love you more&quot;<br>
We both then blew kisses in to the phone and laughed then hung up. I <br>
was so excited that he asked me over there and he wanted to see me again. I was just glad to be his friend, he made me so happy and he was<br>
all i thought about. He really knows how to keep people smiling and<br>
happy, i feel like i can be around him all the time. He teaches me stuff<br>
that know one eles will teach me. He is a great person and i really love<br>
him so much i don't care what other people say. Four hours since i got off the phone with Michael, my parents came home so i talked to them<br>
about what he had asked me.<br>
&quot;Mom....Dad?&quot;<br>
&quot;yes dear?&quot; my dad asked.<br>
&quot;i have something to ask you......&quot;<br>
I then got out what i had to say and we had a long talk about it and i told them what i would do when i got back and they finally agreed so now i<br>
get to go. They told me i couldn't like you know? because of the allegations and things. But i never believed a word. I kept with Michaels<br>
word. I told my parents that Michael and i were also good friends.<br>
I also have to wait til Michael calls me back so i can let him know that<br>
it is ok to go. I then heard the phone ring so i answered it.<br>
&quot;hello?&quot;<br>
&quot;hey it's Michael again&quot;<br>
&quot;oh hi&quot; i said with an even bigger smile on my face.<br>
&quot;i just wanted to talk to you again&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah i can tell&quot; i was laughing.<br>
&quot;whats so funny?&quot;<br>
&quot;i just got great news!&quot;<br>
&quot;oh really? what is it?&quot;<br>
&quot;i can come!&quot;. <br>
