<br>
(Though why you would want to read my ramblings is totally beyond me.)<br>
<br>
This week has been a rather trying one (and it's only Wednesday). I've spent more time sleeping than doing anything else. That's what pain pills will do to you, I guess. Not that I mind - I love sleep. But I have a lot else to do, like taking my car into the shop, and writing out a couple of applications, and finishing a paper or two for school. But why worry about stuff like that, when there's sleep to be had and movies to be watched?<br>
<br>
When I wasn't asleep, I've been reading The Fellowship of the Ring. I've never read it before, and I'm trying to finish it before the next movie comes out. We'll see... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> MaiKana</span><br> <span class=usertitle><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/person/krank.gif>A Stranger with No Real Name</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(11/14/02 10:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Amy's Journal</span><hr size=1> LOL!

<br>
So that means no  more sleep all day, miss all my classes, miss work, and have an excuse for it anymore. Sigh. That was kind of fun. But only for a week, because I think if I was on total bedrest, I'd go insane. But of course  now I have a lot to catch up on. A LOT. And I am so tired of that. But I guess, being a procrastinator, that's what I get, huh?<br>
<br>
Today I was reminded of the power of prayer. I was talking to a friend in Australia about one of our mutual friends in London (yes, we're quite a cosmopolitan little group to come out of someplace like Michigan). And my London friend is just tortured by clinical depression. My first response was to pray for her. (Especially after reading the Faith Healing discussion in the God-Lovers forum.) I know that God hears my prayers and answers, but in my faith tradition (presbyterian) it is so easy to fall into the trap of &quot;God's will will win out, no matter what I  do.&quot; Which is true, of course. But it's just like with evangelism. Maybe it is God's will for me to pray for her and  pray for her healing? How dare I go against His will (or at least try - I don't think we can thwart His will)?<br>
<br>
WARNING: As this is my journal, I cannot be held responsible for the randomness of my thoughts recorded here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, I just want to pray and pray for my friend.<br>
<br>
...Well, that's not exactly true. I want to call her and go see her and tell her everything's going to be okay. A lot of her depression stems from this need to be perfect, like her sister, this need to live up to a totally unrealistic goal. And when one thing goes wrong - snowball effect, and she drowns in it. She actually left college my senior year because she couldn't handle it anymore.Nothing big, just a million little things.<br>
<br>
And it sounds like she's going that way again. Little job troubles, little  marriage troubles, little health issues - and it just overwhelms her. <br>
<br>
But what can you do for a person struggling with depression? I mean, unless you're going through it yourself, it's practically impossible to understand. And I am an  optimist by nature.<br>
<br>
(I think the Lord's trying to teach me compassion.)<br>
<br>
Anyway. I wil write to her  later, and send her a good book. (It's a Vera Wang wedding book, full of BEAUTIFUL pics. She's a fashion designer, and her specialty is wedding dresses, so I think Vera Wang'll be a good prize.)<br>
<br>
Right now I am planning  my trip to Australia. I'm going  to visit my friend there. I can't wait! Only 2 more months! I've never been to Australia, so I'm way excited. It'll be my 12th country. I have a list of 100 countries I want to visit in my lifetime, so, this'll be another one checked off my list. Of course, that's not the only reason to go. (I also wantto fill up my passport before I have to get a new one in 4 years.) And I want to see my friends again. <br>
<br>
You know how there are just a few people in your life who are going to be your friends for ever? Well, I'm not speaking from the wisdom of the ages or anything, but in my experience, there are just some people who are going to be your friends forever, and they'll always be there for you, even if they're on the other side of the world. I have a few: in Chicago, London, and Melbourne. The  closest one is almost 3000 miles away from me. But that just doesn't even matter. It's cool to know that they are there for me - and I am there for them.<br>
<br>
Okay, before I get all maudlin (it IS pretty late), let us change the subject. Let's talk about some books.<br>
<br>
I am reading, like I said, Fellowship of the Ring. I'm also reading On the Road (Jack Kerouac), which I've never read before. And FastFood Nation, which is about the seamy underbelly of the fast food empire. Kind of interesting. <br>
<br>
I also just finished In a Sunburned Country, by Bill Bryson. If you didn't already know, I LOVE travel books. Especially travel literature (you know, stories about people's travels to other places?). And Bill Bryson is the funniest. Seriously. I read his books at work, and everyone knows when I'm reading one, because I can't help but giggle. They laugh at me, but there you go. I don't mind. Every once in awhile a vulgar word will slip in, but mostly his books are just hilarious. Especially if you've been to the places he's describing. He has one on the US called The Lost Continent. If you haven't traveled outside the US, but you know all about small towns in the Midwest, pick this one up. It's great. Then, once you're hooked, there are several more, all excellent fun.<br>
<br>
I could talk and talk about books, but for now I shan't. It's almost 3AM, and I still haven't gone to sleep. (So much for the warning label on my drugs. May Cause Drowsiness indeed!) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/bchristlikebooklovers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=femalenomad>FemaleNomad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezWannabe</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#3333ff>(11/19/02 11:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 19th</span><hr size=1> Okay, here's a HUGE answer to prayer - my loan check finally came in!!! Which means I can actually pay my rent AND buy groceries - all in the same week!<br>
<br>
So...maybe that's not terribly exciting to you, but believe me, it's been a challenge living on my wages lately. Because my rent is more than half my take-home pay for the month. Oh well...<br>
<br>
Ugh. I am so challenged by the topics here at GLO, sometimes. All this deep thinking gives me a bit of a headache. In a good way, of course, but still...sometimes I don't WANT to think. Oh well. It's good for me. Makes me more honest, and it makes me really understand why I believe what I do and how I do. And that's a good thing.<br>
<br>
Still...<br>
<br>
Here's another answer to prayer. I got into a great religious discussion with a couple of people at work today. I am the resident bible authority (which isn't saying much), so I get into these discussions a lot. Today it was about women in ministry. I am still not sure what I think about that. Hmm...maybe I should ask some GLOers for their thoughts? Later. The cool thing about these conversations is that I get to share openly about my faith, and the conversations inevitably lead around to the Gospel...it is so cool. Especially since I REALLY do not like doing initiative evangelism. But when I can share the gospel as a result of a conversation - wow! I mean, you just have to know it's God working. Awesome.<br>
<br>
Hmm...I have a lot of work to do - a couple of papers to write, and a movie to watch - but I don't want to quite yet. <br>
<br>
You know, sometimes I wonder what I'm doing here at GLO. Because I disagree with so much of the common thought, I feel like all I'm doing is arguing, and how is that helping anyone or glorifying Christ at all? But at the same time, didn't God create this diversity? Because I don't say all I say just to raise eyebrows or  tempers, or to play devil's advocate. I mean, I have been thinking on most of this stuff for a few years now. Is it wrong to come to a different conclusion? I don't think anything I've said is heretical... But I don't want to get all maudlin, so<br>
<br>
Oh well. Something else to pray about.<br>
<br>
I got a message from my advisor in Scotland today. And I am getting quite excited about the possibility of studying over there! Like, maybe it is for real. Maybe I can actually do this. Maybe they'll REALLY accept me!!!<br>
<br>
Well, I've lost my train  of thought. And I should at least watch that other movie tonight before I go to sleep, so I can write the paper tomorrow. Did you know I have like 3 weeks left in this term? It's crazy! And that makes me all the closer to graduating! Yahooooooooo! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/bchristlikebooklovers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=femalenomad>FemaleNomad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezHopeful</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#3333ff>(11/25/02 12:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 24th</span><hr size=1> Almost the 25th, but still the 24th for an hour yet.<br>
<br>
I am STILL trying to get  through the Fellowship of the Ring. I'm pretty well stuck in the middle. Bummer.<br>
<br>
But that's  not all I'm reading. I'm also reading &quot;Naturally Gifted,&quot; which is (of course) a book about the gifts God has given us, and finding and using them.  I'm still not exactly sure what my gifts are, so this is cool.<br>
<br>
I'm also reading a report on Women in Ministry from my denomination. It is vastly interesting. And a couple of items for another class - the Frankfurt and Lausanne covenants. I'm still on a quest for the Frankfurt one, though. Oh well.<br>
<br>
Soon (after school is finished for the term), I'll be reading that David Barton book. Just not yet, because I'm behind enough already!!!<br>
<br>
I scheduled my classes for next term. I'm pretty excited. Graduation looms ever nearer...and then there's Scotland, and before that, Australia...and now my friend's talking about a trip to Greece in July! I don't know if I can swing that...wonder if I can talk her into postponing it until next year? Unless my parents, in their ever-widening wisdom, see fit to give me a plane ticket to Greece for graduation. Not likely, is it? Well, we'll see.<br>
<br>
This week, I have to write a paper for one class, a thesis proposal, two simple papers for another class, and finish my movie journal for a third class. Then NEXT week, I have 2 more papers, and then 2 term papers (i.e.: BIG papers) to write. <br>
<br>
You know, every term I tell myself that this time it's going to be different. This time I'm not going to procrastinate. This time I'm going to work AHEAD. Well, I've been in school for all but four and a half years of my life (give or take), and I still haven't managed to get ahead but for my second term in Ireland, when I knew I had ten term papers to write. And then I was only 2 weeks ahead of the game. Argh.<br>
<br>
But next quarter really WILL be different.  It has to be, because I'm going to miss almost 2 weeks right in the middle when I go to Australia. And I have to have that work done ahead of time,  or else I'm going to be doing it on the plane (no thanks).<br>
<br>
Um, much as I love writing everything I think down, I should probably get to those papers. <br>

Anyway, let's talk about what I'm reading at the moment. Just a few books (I can't decide which to finish first, so I'm reading them all):<br>
<br>
Almost French, by Sarah Turnbull. It's another travel book, about an Australian journalist who left her old life and now resides in Paris, with all the challenges and culture shock that involves.<br>
<br>
The Crimson Petal and the White. Definitely not a book I'd recommend to most of the people who visit CLBL, GLO, and all the rest, but spectacularly well-written and involving. It follows the life of a 19th century London prostitute. <br>
<br>
The Two Towers. I have almost a year to finish it before the Return of the King comes to the theatres.<br>
<br>
Making a Literary Life, by Carolyn See. A beautiful, fabulous book about writing and being a writer - I highly recommend it to anyone - ANYONE - who really wants to write.<br>
<br>
And textbooks. I am going to pick up a copy of the Koran this afternoon, I think, too. And I'm reading the psalms. Wow!<br>

I am still in the depths of despair.<br>
<br>
Well, maybe not quite, but still...<br>
<br>
The good thing is, today I got a phone call from a long lost friend I have been missing and wishing I could talk to for about a million years. Two, at least. It was great to talk to him again, but it was kind of sad, too, because we're not as close as we used to be, and I MISS that friendship! He used to keep me accountable for so much; he's such a strong Christian. <br>
<br>
Once, I even though I would marry him. But now that's not the case. Still and all, I miss him. I miss having that spiritual voice in my life. Because, let's be honest, my spiritual voice has laryngitis. I'm afraid it might be permanent. <br>
<br>
Today I had only one class, and in that class I just realized how much I hate it. Really truly. It's a class on folk religions, world religions, etc. And it is SO not about that! It's about the theory of religion and how to map out what a religion is/does/appears to be. Forgive me, but that's pretty lame. Religion is an awfully personal thing, and no two people are going to practice their faith, whatever it is, the same. I'd far prefer to actually LEARN about religions! For example, Islam. I know nothing about Islam. I'm 26 years old, and completely ignorant on this topic! Ugh.<br>
<br>
All in all, I am feeling pretty negative about my life in general. I am far from the Lord - and I'm mighty good at saying all the right things - even though I know I believe in Him, and have saving faith in Jesus Christ. But the rest of it, the relational part of it, is pretty much at a standstill. Has been for about a year. (Well, if I'm completely honest, it's been that way for about.....five years?) I mean, I have moments, but in general, my faith is empty and dying. It's pathetic. Here I am at a seminary where I finally feel at home, learning from some truly excellent professors. I have a good job in a bookstore. I have friends, travel plans, and future goals. WHAT IS MY PROBLEM??!?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I might be pouring out my guts here pretty often for awhile. If y'all read this, feel free to comment at will. If you don't, that's cool, too. I don't care.<br>
<br>
Reading....I forgot a book: A Return to Modesty. Good stuff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bchristlikebooklovers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=laughinglauraj>laughinglauraj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezHappy</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/14/03 10:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 13 Feb</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;font-family:comic sans ms;">Well, Amy, I feel like that sometimes too.  You know what I do...I sit in my room and reread the gospels-the crucifixion scene.  I try to picture it in my head as I read about the betrayal and the death.  By the time I finish the first one, I have a new gratitude and a new appreciation.  Then I pray.  That's what works for me.  I just need to keep the gift that came through his suffering fresh in my head--to remember the sacrifice, etc.  <br>
We sing this song &quot;Don't let me walk too far from Calvary.&quot;  I love it b.c it talks about remembering the sacrifice.  I think if we keep that in mind, we can't help but feel that enthusiasm of our salvation.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bchristlikebooklovers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=femalenomad>FemaleNomad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezHopeful</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#3333ff>(5/4/03 3:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 4 May 03</span><hr size=1> Okay, so I'm supposed to be packing right now, but I can't seem to make myself do it.<br>
<br>
Laura, even though I never said it then, I wanted to thank you for your thoughts. Your encouragement was something I needed to hear.<br>
<br>
Anyway. It's been a few months. What's new here? Um, I received my first-ever rejection slip. Honestly. I've never been rejected from ANYTHING I wanted before. It was a slightly humbling experience to receive that too-thin envelope from University of Edinburgh. Just looking at it, I knew I didn't get in. <br>
<br>
But, you know, about two weeks after I sent my application in, I decided I didn't really want to go. That I wanted to stay here. Get a life. A real job, put down roots, etc. So, it wasn't a huge let-down. Just kind of a surprise.<br>
<br>
My mom said the same thing. &quot;This is your first rejection slip, Amy!&quot; Yeah. We talked about framing it, like businesses frame their first dollar of profit. lol!<br>
<br>
Anyway. It's 3pm. I REALLY should finish packing. <br>
<br>
Right now, I am reading.....Word of Honor (NElson DeMille - eh), Two Towers (still), and a few million textbooks I don't want. And something else, I think. Oh, Urban Chic - a girl's guide to city living on next to nothing. Pretty fun.<br>
<br>
Now I AM going to pack! I AM!!!<br>

I have dry, distant times from the Lord, too. <br>
Without Him, life seems to filter through my eye and my thoughts with a lot of baggage and darkness and emptiness.<br>
It's especially then, that I know I need to stop.<br>
Stop and clear away a day or even a few hours to spend in solid worship and prayer. Take a day to myself and commit to spend it in communion with Him, and Him alone. It makes a world of difference, literally.<br>
So, I encourage you. Take a day, rest in His holiness. Find yourself in Him. Rid the distractions of this life and be still before Him.<br>
<br>
I've just learned recently, that I NEED to spend every morning listening to my worship music and reading my Bible ...in order to start my day off right, in order that my life, my day might be filtered through His thoughts, His truths and not my own.<br>
<br>
God always has something fresh and new for us to learn and grasp and exercise every morning. I love that about Him. That's why it never gets old or tiresome...because His thoughts are not ours, His ways are not ours. <br>
<br>
It's a constant challenge, to practice His ways and not MY ways. <br>
<br>
I'll be praying for you, that you are able to clear aways the stuff of life each day so that you may spend it in rest and renewal with Him.<br>
<br>
He sees you...as no one else truly does. He'll meet with you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showPrevMessage?topicID=24.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showNextMessage?topicID=24.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.emailToFriend?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.threadControl?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="christlikebookloversfrm16">Bookends<option value="christlikebookloversfrm31">Amusement Park<option value="christlikebookloversfrm25">Christian Fiction<option value="christlikebookloversfrm22">General Fiction<option value="christlikebookloversfrm33">Science Fiction<option value="christlikebookloversfrm26">Christian Non-Fiction<option value="christlikebookloversfrm21">General Non-Fiction<option value="christlikebookloversfrm24">Teen's<option value="christlikebookloversfrm23">Children's<option value="christlikebookloversfrm30">Poetry<option value="christlikebookloversfrm29">Poets Unite!<option value="christlikebookloversfrm27">Journals<option value="christlikebookloversfrm20">Administration</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bchristlikebooklovers>Christ Like Book Lovers</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27>Journals</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
