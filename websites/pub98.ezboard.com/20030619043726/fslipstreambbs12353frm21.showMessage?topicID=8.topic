<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Administrator and Moderator Powers<br>
<br>
Only the moderator of a specific forum can hand out a warning in that forum. Admins are still allowed to transfer threads to other forums in the case of off-topic discussions. <br>
<br>
Moderators and admins should set an example for the rest of the BBS. They should never flame anyone, and always try to keep their temper. They should also refrain from discussing any of their BBS admin actions in threads other than Suggestions/Feedback, again in order to set an example for the rest of the BBS. Having a thicker skin than usual is a requirement to be a mod or an admin. <br>
<br>
In case a moderator or admin does not do this, other moderators have a right and a duty to also issue warnings to fellow mods and admins, just as they would do with regular members. Any warning handed out to moderators or admins will count as two warnings. <br>
<br>
The Board Review Forum<br>
<br>
Future discussions on administrative actions and BBS policy should take place only in this forum. In the case administrative action is taken in a thread in one of the other forums, do not post about that in the actual thread, as that will let the thread go far off-topic. <br>
<br>
If a moderator takes administrative action in a thread, he or she should also include a link to the Suggestions/Feedback forum so that members know where to go to discuss a particular issue. <br>
<br>
Whining, trolling, and causing trouble will not be tolerated in this forum. That includes needlessly and repeatedly calling for posters to be banned.<br>
<br>
Spamming<br>
<br>
Do not spam. Spam is defined as posting the same thing over and over in the same thread, forum or in all the forums. Also, it is posting excessively in a short time with posts that normally are only one or two sentences or words. In some cases, it is even posting too many threads. Usually, only two or three threads is considered a proper and safe amount to post in one forum. Spamming will result in an official warning. <br>
<br>
Flaming<br>
<br>
Flaming will, of course, not be allowed. Do not insult people on the board, period. You're free to post negative comments about someone's opinion, but never actually about that someone him/herself. In general, a flame can be defined as being aimed at one particular person or group of persons, and of an insulting or malicious nature. If you do not agree with someone or feel that a person has not studied the subject at hand carefully enough, it is not in order to question someone's intellectual capabalities or post derogative remarks. Using strong language in relation to someone else will not be tolerated. <br>
<br>
Flames are also counted as such if they are directed at people involved in creating the show, who are not able to defend themselves here. It is okay to criticise their work, but please also treat them with respect. <br>
<br>
Flaming someone will give you an official warning, unless it's a very serious flame, in which case it will count as two official warnings. The moderator will edit the message containing the flame to include an official warning and a link to Suggestions if the admin action needs to be discussed, and the flame itself should not be discussed in the original thread itself. If the flame is of an especially strong nature that could strongly disrupt the peace of the BBS, the moderator can remove it at his/her discretion, provided he/she retains a copy of the flame for future reference. <br>
<br>
If you are flamed, do not respond in kind. Saying you were only defending yourself will not cut it, and your return flames will be dealt with just as severely. Instead, you should take the high road and either not react or post a message saying this was uncalled for, but never respond by flaming yourself. Always contact a moderator. If you are a moderator or admin and are flamed, do not react to it - it is the job of other moderators to handle it, and you should not pressure them into doing so. <br>
<br>
The reason you shouldn't discuss the flame or the admin action following on it in the thread is that otherwise the thread will just degenerate into a flame war / off-topic discussion. <br>
<br>
Trolling<br>
<br>
Trolling is defined as posting remarks intended to anger another poster and or start an argument or flame war. Trolling will be edited or deleted at the Administrators' discretion. Do not respond to trolling aimed at you. Contact an Administrator. Trolling will result in a warning or, in extreme cases, the troll will be banned. <br>
<br>
Dual Usernames<br>
<br>
Please only register one account at this BBS. Deliberately trying to mislead people with two distinct &quot;identities&quot; posting at the same time, will not be tolerated, and may lead to an immediate ban. The Administrators will not transfer post count between usernames. Do not ask. It makes them angry, and only Lisa and Christian can do it anyway. <br>
<br>
Plagiarism/Pirating/Privacy<br>
<br>
Please do not post material on the board you do not have a right to post. This includes, but is not limited to, ICQ logs, pictures, or other private details. Also do not post links to R or X-rated sites. This will also result in a warning, and the deletion of the offending material. <br>
<br>
Do not allow your account to be used by someone else. Carefully guard your password and make sure it can not be used by other persons. Impersonating someone or allowing someone to use your account will lead to a warning. <br>

<br>
That thing definitely needs trimming IMO.<br>
<br>
We should start with the EZ board rules and only expand where the members decide it is absolutely necessary.<br>
<br>
Flaming people that do not belong to this board?  Pshah...<br>
<br>
Spamming...  Not such a problem here me thinks.  Only EXTREME cases should be dealt with by a mod at all IMO.<br>
<br>
The Admins should be able to warn mods and the mods should also have the power to warn Admins when the situation calls for it.  Banning an Admin might also be possible if the other two admins agree.  No one should be above the law...<br>
<br>

<br>
Administrator and Moderator Powers<br>
<br>
Only the moderator of a specific forum can hand out a warning in that forum. Admins are still allowed to transfer threads to other forums in the case of off-topic discussions. <br>
<br>
Moderators and Admins should set an example for the rest of the BBS. Having a thicker skin than usual is a requirement to be a Mod or an Admin. They should refrain from flaming anyone, and always try to keep their temper.  However, Moderators and Admins are people and posters as well, and enjoy the same rights and privileges as everyone else.<br>
<br>
In case a regular poster genuinely feels a Mod or Admin has &quot;crossed the line&quot; of normal posting, other Moderators have a right and a duty to also issue warnings to their fellow Mods and Admins, just as they would do with regular members. <br>
<br>
The Board Review Forum<br>
<br>
Future discussions on administrative actions and BBS policy should take place only in this forum. If administrative action is taken in a thread in one of the other forums, do not post about that in the actual thread, as that will let the thread go far off-topic. <br>

Usually, only two or three threads is considered a proper and safe amount to post in one forum. <br>
<br>
Flaming<br>
<br>
Flaming as an exercise of free speech will be tolerated to the extent that it does not inhibit reasonable conversation on the board.  The Admins and Mods may take action against a flamer only if they feel the flamer is disrupting the flow of the board. <br>
<br>
Trolling<br>
<br>
Trolling is defined as posting remarks intended to anger another poster and or start an argument or flame war.  The fundemental rule of posting on this board is: don't do to others what you wouldn't want done to you.  In other words, don't dish it out if you can't take it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dual Usernames<br>
<br>
Please only register one account at this BBS.  This avoids confusion in the forums.  However, the Admins and Mods will not actively police the registration of usernames.  If a member is using multiple accounts to inhibit the reasonable function of this board, then the Admin may take action.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Plagiarism/Pirating/Privacy<br>
<br>
Intellectual property should be respected.  Authors work hard on their material and take a great deal of pride in it.   Please do not post material on the board you do not have a right to post. This includes, but is not limited to, ICQ logs, private pictures, or other private details. This may result in a warning, and will definitely result in the deletion of the offending material. <br>
<br>
Do not allow your account to be used by someone else. Carefully guard your password and make sure it can not be used by other persons. Impersonating someone or allowing someone to use your account will lead to a warning. <br>

Now I don't think we should have official warning personally, so that might need to be trimmed a bit more.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I also don't see a problem with Dual usernames.<br>
<br>
Not to mention I don't think we want to have to try to track duals and constantly keep an eye out for possible duals...<br>
<br>
Just a few comments.  Take them for what they're worth.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I want to engage in real discussions, not get bogged down with folks throwing insults around.  Lots of people retreat to insults when they can't come up with actual arguments or evidence to support their position.  I think we might need some sort of civility/no-flaming policy.  I don't mean that we should discourage free speech; I love free speech.  I just don't think we should encourage flaming.  Perhaps we can have a flame forum.  Flames and flame wars can start, end and/or be transferred there.  That way if you want to flame, you can; If you don't, you can discuss issues in the other forums.  I know that I'm probably in the minority with this concern.<br>

<br>
Are we going EFCL and having the membership vote on issues? We need this one to be quite specific, I don't want Admins to get caught in the cross-fire of conflicting membership.<br>
<br>
So, how we determine the 'will of the membership' needs to be hammered out.<br>

You can get away with never editing or deleting at TK, but we probably can't do that here.<br>
