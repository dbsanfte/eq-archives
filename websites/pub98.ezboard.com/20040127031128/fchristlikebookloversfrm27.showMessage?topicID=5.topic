Well things have been so crazy for me as of late. I don't know why, but when I get home from school all I want to do is sleep. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that I am up now, at midnight? But, then again, if it is, why am only tired after I get home at like 3PM? Is that when things finally chatch up to me or does my bod just know there is a bed there...that I can sleep in! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :confused --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/confused3.gif ALT=":confused"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So, this means, I had a paper due in language today and did it this morning before school. Even though I've known about it for like 2 - 3 weeks. I am the worst procastinator! I hope I get an A on it though. Speaking of A's, apparently we are at mid-quarter. I know for sure I have 5 A's. I am not sure about Health/Human Sexuality because I was gone and didn't get to turn in some things ... and it gets complicated! But, I am sure I can take care of it because we do get done with Sex Ed. this week! Two weeks of is enough of that darn class! This year the theme is &quot;birth&quot; so we saw a lady have a baby for the &quot;main event&quot; and we've just been talking about goals and stuff. I dunno. We talk about STD's sometime this week and the nurse is supposed to be coming in to talk about birth control...woohoo! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm sure you wanted to know all that! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am worried about geometry though, I SHOULD be doing my homework in it right now, but of course, I am not. I am afraid of Trig next year.<br>
<br>
Ohhhh my gosh. Get this. I signed up for Honors English next year and so my parents get this letter. This is the first year they have had open enrollment in honors english (previously you had to write a paper on a saturday and get teacher's approval) so they are &quot;offering&quot; for a .5 credit (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IF</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you go for the whole deal or 30 days, I'm not sure which) for a Summer Pre - Honors English Class. It is held from 8-1:30 (you are only there for a 1.5 hour session each day.) and it is from like the monday after we get out (June....15 or something) to August!!! It's our WHOLE vaction! Good thing it is optional, or I would be in regular english!!!! It's dumb in my opinion, it is supposed to be &quot;getting us ready&quot; (I've heard you do a paper a week <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) but that's gay, because it's like punishing us for being in honors! Ok, I can't do it because my family works and they aren't providing transportation so how do I get there? Plus, I have other things to do this summer! Darn them!!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm done venting for now!!<br>
<br>

Today my Mom got this letter from PHS (Pasco High) and it that they are offering a new ninth grade course (science course that is) called &quot;College Prep Chemistry&quot; (part of out &quot;ROUTE&quot; block, with Health and Comp. Lit.) It says the program is deisnged for advanced students who will be concurrently enrolled in Honors Geometry or Honors Algebra 3-4 as a frosh. (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOTE:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I am <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Honors</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Algebra 3-4, I am in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> REGULAR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Algebra 3-4.

It also says that You child WILL be enrolled in College Prep Chem./ROUTE next year unless you notify your child's counselor or a PH admin. <br>
<br>
ODD! Why did I get this, if I am not in Honors? Well, I do know that I am calling my couselor for next year.....hmm!

Just..browsing. Infact just a sec. ago I was reading Melbo's and SirWill's LiveJournal. Makes me want one..../sigh.<br>
<br>
WHY do I do this? I am grr...dumb I guess..I don't know. Here it is: 12:30, I was going to go to bed an HOUR ago! It's horrible. <br>
<br>
Oh, cool news! (kind of) Tonight at 9:30 I was studying for my history test tomarrow with my sister (she was asking me questions and critisizing my teacher, hehe) the phone rang. I mean, who calls at 9:30? (At least at my house!) Noone! Expecpt maybe, my Mom's friend Ann (is there an &quot;e&quot; I don't remember..) who, like me, is a night owl! She like starts baking cookies at 11...Needles to say, I like Ann(e) alot! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Anyway. It turns out (as I catch my breath from running down the stairs) that it's my friend Myaela, I'm like &quot;Why is she calling me now?&quot; Turns out MP (Micheal-Paul) was there and she FINALLY 3-wayed me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy/biggrina.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I had wanted to hear his voice for forever!

So, /sigh, yeah. He has a girly voice though, and he's 16. I was like &quot;umm k&quot; but whatever! She's talked to him for 3 hours (granted we are 14!!!!) and I am ever so jelious! I *think* the longest I've talked to a guy...(or a girl?) is 2 hours. I know for sure I talked to Ross for 2 hours Easter. And, I think I've talked to Steve for that long, although, most of our converstaion is meaningless. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :s --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/nsrtrts/nsrtrts_57.gif ALT=":s"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But, its all good. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Dissing though is mostly cool, I mean, believe me, just ask Ross, I am a darn good disser! But, darn MP! Ugh. Oh well, no biggie though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's all good, just *right now* I'm like /sigh. I wonder if what he said is true too, maybe that's why I am upset about it all who knows?<br>
<br>
Anyway, did I tell you I am running for ASB President for next year at PHS? Well, I don't think so, and I am. I picked up my forms today. Not much to it really. I am excited, the main reason I am running is because last year I lost to a &quot;prep&quot; I plan to win this year! (Watch me lose!!! HAHA) I dunno. I want to see who else is running...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eyebrow --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/nsrtrts/nsrtrts_222.gif ALT=":eyebrow"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That should be interesting. <br>
<br>
Lastly. erm, I should talk about Paralelle Journeys. But I need to go to bed. So I will tell you that today in Lititure we got a new book we are reading (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :read2 --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/nsrtrts/nsrtrts_297.gif ALT=":read2"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :read --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/nsrtrts/nsrtrts_22.gif ALT=":read"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) for lit. circles. It's a Sci-Fi novel called &quot;Invitation to the game&quot; I read like the first page...It sounds OK, we'll see!<br>
<br>

<br>
I started reading another book, I'm only on like page 56 though..more later on that.<br>

I was *going* to talk about my friend Brittney...Well I will say this because it's on my mind...she jokingly commented to me today during PE (because I had eaten lunch with Myaela in Mr. Sapp's room [like 7 people where in his room today, we had a test...but I know some people just go in there whenever and stuff...anyway]) &quot;you friend stealer.&quot; It was a joke..but still, it makes me think..  I am not even sure about what, but I am thinking about it. I am trying to &quot;switch&quot; groups, even though they are &quot;co-groups&quot; they hang out togther, but one sets on one end of the lunch table and ...well you know know what I mean if you know groups are..and if you don't you're like &quot;co-groups?!?!&quot; LOL, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy/roflmao.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , it's all good...<br>

 As for my Dad &amp; I everything is all well and good. Except for his work. He is a truck driver and *67* years of age. He works everyday, which I think is crazy anyway for him. He is getting up there (hello!) and he has like leg problems and high colesteral (sp?) and health issues. Well, now in addition to working from 6 am - 5 pm or 6 pm (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I know) he has been having to do bardges at night. Anywhere from 10 pm to 12 pm. They take 2 hours I'd say. So for the past few days my dad has...<br>
5 AM - get up<br>
6 AM - go to work<br>
6 PM - come home<br>
11 PM - go back to work<br>
1 AM - come home<br>
5 AM - get up again.<br>
 Personaly, I feel quite guilty. Really, if it wasn't for me he really wouldn't need to work at all. (My brother &amp; sister ages 25&amp;26) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> /big sigh</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

June 30, 2002<br>
 I'm sitting here taking a bath, thinking about my life. I wish I could say that I was &amp; have been spending my summer doing something instead of watching TV or being on the internet, yet I can not. I'm not ashamed of this fact though. I have a (usually) very enjoyable time. Chatting with dear friends, ezboarding, dling music ext. I think my family has a hard time accepting the fact that my life really does revolve around the internet. I am called names &amp; generally picked on by my brother. I could go on. Tonight my Mom said I could NOT get on the net, since she found me up last night at 3.30 AM. She has left her door open, but I might still get on. I don't know why I feel the need to talk to Steve so much. I think the fact that he says he likes me fills this &quot;void&quot; that I think I have, but really don't. I find myself being highly spektical about him really meaning it &amp; about most things in general. I relish the fact thta he at least says he likes me (even if he dosen't) because I have to often been made fun of because of my weight/looks. I don't know how many times younger kids would embresess &amp; make funof their friends (&amp; untimatley me too) by pointing to me &amp; say &quot;you're going out w/her!&quot; &amp; laugh and run away. I realize they are little more than children, but it still stings. I don't tell you this in order to recieve your sympathy, rather to let you know why I am a skeptic on someone likeing me &amp; finding me attractive (I sent him my pictures - the FCCLA ones) The other reason I am a skeptic is because things in my life have forced me to be. Tiffany mainly. Since I know she likes to &quot;emblish&quot; (tell a &quot;fish-tell&quot; if you will) I have come to not only doubt everything <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>she</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> says, but everything anyone else says as well. I wish things where not that way, but unforunatley they are. Anyway I've written enough, hope you can read it, I almost can't!<br>
