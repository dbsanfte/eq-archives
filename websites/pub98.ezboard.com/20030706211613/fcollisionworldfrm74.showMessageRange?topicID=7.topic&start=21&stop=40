What a pretty plaace to live.  Huts made of the driftwood and such of the sea, and gold sirens walking about, carefree and unafraid.<br>
<br>
What a life this must be to live.<br>
<br>
She found a stream nearby and scooped a bit of water into a clam shell that had made its way from the place where the fresh water met the ocean.  Carefully she made the potion, having done it a deal of times before when the lack mage had been lain to waste by the powers of the black moon.<br>
<br>
Her tears mingled with the potion's water, casting bits of glwing green in the glowign stuff before going dull again.  This was all her fault.  If she hadn't gone with Tryphaena, Azalea would have been able to cross into the new phase more carefully.  She would be alright.  If she hadn't gone, Aeli would still be safe and sound in Denton.<br>
<br>
This was all her fault.<br>
<br>
Biting her lip, she finished creating the potion and ran back, holding the shell delicately as sure not to spill a drop.<br>
****<br>
<br>
When she came back, she knelt down beside Azalea and poured the bitter potion between her dry lips.  She took her medicine learnedly, and in moments, the shaking stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;thank you,&quot; she said, her eyes fixing dazedly onto her form.  &quot;Oh, thank you, my dear...that feels so much better...&quot; her voice was slightly slurring in weariness.  &quot;There is nothing more you can do...I must be allowed to rest for a while.&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded silently.  &quot;You heard her.  Come, let's go.&quot; She shooed the others politely outside and clsed the curtains, leavign the mage in comfortable darkness.  She took Aeli by the hand and led him out, trying to avoid his eyes in order for him to miss the sorrow and guilt they uncontrollably held.<br>
<br>
Out in the sunlight, the five sirens looked with sudden interest at Aeli and Laurena.  But mostly Aeli.  Their mouths went wide in speechless o's and they began to whisper excitedly among themselves, one making an x-shape with her finger.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is wrong?&quot;  Laurena asked.<br>
<br>
The one that seemed to be their speaker spoke up, a bit nervously.  &quot;It's nothing, Phoenix...it's just...we've heard from a tide of fleeing northern birds, that Drak-shiramik has fallen under the hands of the Mage Redmark.  But we also heard...&quot;  she stopped, but her friends pushed her on.  &quot;We also hard...that a brave, valiant young man with a cross shaped scar on his cheek slew the terrible Tryphaena with an arrow, and that the Dark Queen of Sirens rests beneath the rubble.  Is this him?  Did he kill the Dark Queen?&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena paused, a warm glow comign to her face as it finally set in the fact that Tryphaena was dead.  She looked upon Aeli with warm admiration and adoration.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, he is.  And yes, he did,&quot; she said softly, but warmly.<br>
<br>
At first, the group of girls were silent, Then, in a unisioned, fluid gesture, all knelt down on one knee, bowing their heads to Aeli in utmost respect and honor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Sir Aeli!&quot; the leader cried. &quot;We owe you unpayable gratitude.  Tryphaena has oppressed our people for years.  To see her fall is truly a mark of the end of the age of darkness for us.&quot;  A few of them were actually brought to tears of joy.  &quot;Thank you, Sir Aeli.  Thank you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Larena smiled at him silently, her tears of guilt turning into tears of happiness at the sirens' overjoyment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 809<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(5/18/03 9:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Speechless</span><hr size=1> Aeli gave a deep sigh and looked away. For some reason, it just didn't feel right. Tryphaena couldnt've been defeated so easily...but he had given her a fatal blow in her time of weakness. she must be dead, but he didn't want to believe it.<br>
<br>
FInally, he turned his head to the siren girls and nodded his head and response.<br>
&quot;Glory and honor is of no need.&quot; He told them, looking out at the nearby ocean.<br>

But it was your arrow!&quot;  The siren's eyes lit up.  &quot;If we had that arrow, we would place it in the temple before the gods for them to bask upon it forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We should do something,&quot; one chirped excitedly.  &quot;Something to show our gratitude.  They have all freed us from her tyranny!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A celebration is indeed to take place for this,&quot; the other agreed. &quot;A party dedicated to the Three--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Three!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Phoenix--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;--the Archer--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And the Archmage!&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena laughed at the younger girl's chirping.  &quot;There, there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're not stopping us!&quot; one laughed stubbornly.  &quot;We're going to spread the word to the others.  Tonight--a great party for the Three!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Three!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And by the way,&quot; their leader said as the others ran off.  &quot;There are some in the infirmary...victims...&quot; she said, looking carefully at Aeli.  &quot;They need care.&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena nodded. &quot;Will go immediately...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And one more thing,&quot; the siren added.  &quot;Where is your harp?   Where is Lance?  He was with you last we saw you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly Laurena's smile vanished.  All the color drained from her face, and she looked troubled again.  And once more, she avoided Aeli's gaze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Show me to the victims,&quot; Laurena said softly, and solemnly.  the girl went pale herself, and walked forth to show her the way.  Laurena followed silently.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can come if you'd like, Aeli,&quot; she said, her voice holding no emotion.<br>

<br>
&quot;how many of them are there?&quot; Laurena asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;About twenty.  Twenty five, twenty six,&quot; the siren replied solemnly, pushing aside the door flap.<br>
<br>
Laurena went inside, lookign at Aeli and bacing herself for the worst.<br>
<br>
And the worst it was.  The sirens laid in rows, like cornrows in a field. Men, women, and small children alike. Some were moaning and shouting in their sleep, some were tossing and turning in nightmare.  And then, some just lay there, silent and deathly still...just staring at the ceiling...<br>
<br>
Laurena's stomach knotted.<br>
<br>
&quot;These are the victims of Tryphaena's legion,&quot; the siren explained to Aeli.  &quot;Now that she's dead...they'll stop, won't they? They have to stop,&quot; she whispered hopefully.<br>
<br>
Laurena came forth to the first patient, knelt down, and began to heal.<br>
<br>
She would heal every one of them.<br>
<br>
&quot;The sirensong effects many races, more or less,&quot; Laurena spoke quietly.  &quot;But it affects the sirens the most.

Before he met Laurena, he hadn't even seen a siren before, and he'd seen just about every creature in the  world.<br>
<br>
Things were looking grim, and Fate had said something about Akari knowing some  information. That was never good. Akari always knew about something that would  bring death and destruction. As much as Aeli didn't like Akari, he was glad to  have the spy on thier  side. <p>Sekihoutai PRIDE!<br>

A cry from the farther end of the room sent Laurena running.  A mother knelt by her child's bedside, sobbing and clutching the winged boy in her arms.  The boy was lifeless.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's dead, he's dead!&quot; was all she could cry.  &quot;My son is dead!&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena knelt down beside the mother, speakign in the siren language words of assurance and comfort that fell deaf on the mother's ears.  After a bit of effort she managed to ake the dead child from her arms and embrace him with her own.<br>
<br>
She placed the ankh over the boy's heart, and closed her eyes to the white light that shone.  <br>
<br>

Laurena opened her eyes.  Aeli and the mother siren stood over her.  She had fallen, somehow.  Her head felt light and dizzy, and the weight of the child was still in her grasp.<br>
<br>
&quot;You were singing,&quot; the siren who had led them there said.  &quot;Why were you singing?&quot;<br>
<br>
She did not answer.  For then, she felt stirring in her arms.  She looked down, and stared intot he blinking eyes of the siren boy.<br>
<br>
&quot;M-mama...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sirio!&quot; the mother cried, sobbing in joy.  She took the boy form her and held her resurrected son to her tightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mama, come on, knock it off.  I was only asleep for a minute,&quot; he pouted.<br>
<br>
She continued to sob, smiling.  &quot;Of course you were,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Of course.&quot;  Her eyes were on Laurena in pure admiration.<br>
<br>
Laurena only nodded wearily in response.  Standing up, she patted the boy's mouse colored hair before returnign to care for the others, wobbling slightly from the energy loss but refusing to give up on the others.<br>

Quietly and quickly, he left. Out to the beaches he walked, through the village, sirens staring at him and happily chirping amonst themselves. A few moments later, he reached the ocean...So amazingly beautiful and serene. He loved the peacefulness of the ocean. Always had, ever since he remembered, which wasn't too long. <br>

She wished he would have stayed; for some reason her energy was stronger when he was near. But she also did not want him to suffer with the pain of these victims.  However, her energy did gradually deplete, and byt he time she had come down to the last few, she had barely the strength to stand.  She stood on shaky knees as she knelt over a male sirenthat quivered with feverish dream.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Phoenix, no...&quot;  The siren who had led them in the place came over and ulled her away from the sick man before her ankh glowed with the healing light that the girl had heard of so many times before.  Like Sucrecia, Laurena was a siren legend.  &quot;No, Phoenix.  You'll hurt yourself if you don't rest a moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena struggled, lookign inwardly anguished. &quot;They've waited so long...they need me,&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;They've waited months, some of them. They can wait minutes,&quot; she said firmly back, gripping her shoulders.<br>
<br>
The siren let go, however, shocked, when Laurena suddenly started to cry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Phoenix! what is wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; she wept softly, sinking onto the man's heaving chest.  &quot;Something is wrong but I don't know what it is!  I want to be happy, but something is just so, so wrong!  I c-can't help it...&quot;  Her tears dripped from her dark lashes onto the feverish man's face, and glowed purple before absorbing into the man's skin.  His quiverign was almost immediately replaced with easy, peaceful sleep.<br>
<br>
The siren girl was frantic.  Never before had she seen one so upset--and over something so mysterious!  Laurena seemed to be breakign down...she backed away.<br>
<br>
&quot;I-I'll go get Sir Aeli,&quot; the girl stammered nervously.  &quot;He'll know what to do...&quot;  she turned to go, but however, Laurena stopped her, grabbign her hand desperately.  Tears still streaked down her face uncontrollably, and she was filled with such sorrow and grief...but why? She didn't know...<br>
<br>
&quot;No! Please...Aeli mustn't know...&quot;  Laurnea wiped her overflowing eyes.  &quot;He must be happy...he mustn't know...please, don't...I'll be alright...I promise.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But you're crying...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be alright,&quot; she repeated, almost angrily. But her tone softened.  &quot;I'll finish healing them and then I'll go for a walk...and i'll be alright. But you mustn't tell Aeli about this.  Why worry him with things even I can't understand?  He deserves to be happy...&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena lowered her eyes as well as her voice, but not quick enough.  The siren saw the love in her eyes and was shocked.  She'd heard that the Phoenix loved Lance!  Where was he anyway? She had avoided the question before....<br>
<br>
&quot;All right,&quot; the siren agreed reluctantly.  &quot;I won't tell.  I promise.  But please don't cry. There's no reason to be sad.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know...that's why I'm scared.&quot;  Laurena struggled to her feet and continued to heal the last few who laid still with frightened faces.<br>
******<br>
<br>
A sirenling skipped up and down along the beach, humming happily as she collected shells for her necklace.  It was going to be a pretty necklace...she skipped and hummed, her hair bouncing and flying in the wind like a small banner...<br>
<br>
And that is when she saw the man in the water, face down, just close enough to see.<br>
<br>
She froze in fear. A human? He had no wings...was surely a man. He looked large. Large enough to crush her into bits? Enough to kidnap her and send her to slavery? She'd heard the tales, been warned of humans. But she'd also been told to help others in need.  And if there was anyone on Mahtim right now who was in need, it was the strange bald man floatign int he water.<br>
<br>
Cautiously she fluttered over, her small wings not takign her too far before she landed in the gentle surf, just close enoguh to touch him.<br>
<br>
Was he...dead...?<br>
<br>
&quot;S-Sir...?&quot;  Her large green eyes went wide and afraid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkhitokiri@collisionworld>Dark Hitokiri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(5/22/03 4:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Worried Hearts and Shocked Eyes</span><hr size=1> Bubbles appeard near the bald man's face.

She was scared, it was a human! And he looked as though he knew...<br>
<br>
&quot;U-uhh no...&quot; she shook her head violently, blushing rosy.  She was quick to hide behind Aeli, whom her sister had spoken so fondly of just a half an hour ago.  &quot;no tavern, n-no pub...Calm Lands! New Ostona. This is..you're in the Calm Lands.  N-no human taverns...&quot;  She chirped nervously like a baby robin.  Her mother had been right.  Humans were awfully loud...and hairy.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
Azalea lay in her bed, but she could hear Laurena's cries, and heard her thoughts.  she moaned in despair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Laurena,&quot; she rasped to herself.  &quot;You do not know your danger here, in New Ostona.  In the Calm Lands, where you have not been for so long.  Do not wander to the eastern shores.  For you may find the reason this village is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>New</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Ostona.  And you may find your fate...do not go east...&quot; And she was asleep once more.<br>
*****<br>
Laurena finished healing the last person, and watched a while as they awoke, and as they walked out into the sunlight and were greeted with happy ries from their loved ones.  Her tears had dried on her face, had stopped for the time being.  What had brought it on?<br>
<br>
She shook her head of that and when everyne had left, healthy and fine, she walked out feelign as if she were in a dream.  The feeling, she knew, would pass.  <br>
<br>
Laurena headed towards the beach and stopped.  There was Aeli, and a man she had not seen.  A human.  And a siren girl.  She closed her eyes wearily to the sight and headed east of them.  She prayed that Aeli would manage.  She hoped the man was not too badly hurt.  But she could not bear to part with anymore energy today.  In her state, she wasn't sure if she cared whether she was seen or not.<br>
<br>
The ocean breeze was refreshing. With each step, she felt her energy regain.  She did not feel so tired.  The water rushed up to meet her feet, bubbling and frothing about her winged ankles. <br>
<br>
But as she continued East, her footsteps became heavier and slower.  The wind had died down completely, and the water no longer leapt, but was still and stagnant and murky on the sand.  No birds flew here.  There was no life.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Laurena could go no further.  Her feet refused to move, and the air was bereft of her chest.  Her eyes went wide.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>....the screams of the others filled the air, and they dragged her out into the street...her deathsong pierced the blodstained air...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Laurena squinted toward the eastern shore.  All was death as far as her eyes could see.  Nothing moved.  Nothing was alive.  Again she felt tears streaming down her face, uncontrolled.  Through her blurred eyes she saw the dim outline of huts.  but there were no cooking fires, no voices.  No sign of life.<br>
<br>
something horrible had happened over there.<br>
<br>
Laurena backed away, and suddenly, the feeling was gone.  Birds sang and the water crashed upon the shore onto the west, and all seemed right behind her.<br>
<br>
But nothing seemed right to the east.<br>
<br>
Laurena stood as still as a frightened deer, unable to take her eyes off of the dim outline of the silent village.<br>
<br>
(OOC: Laurena is sad because her subconscious knows they are near the place where she was killed, but she doesn't know that.  Her village was Ostona, and this is New Ostona. Meanign...yeah.

Her eyes were fixed on that village...why was it so silent over there?  Why was everything so bleak....?<br>
<br>
Again she tried to cross the invisible line, and again she found herself unable to move, unable to feel.  Her hands went to her throat, which burned with lack of air.  She backed away again, and the dreadful feeling passed.<br>
<br>
Twice was enough.  Frightened and confused, she wandered back west, each step in that direction filling her with assurance and strength.  But her mind was lost, filled with many thoughts at once.<br>
<br>
Tryphaena was dead.  Oh, goodness, she was dead.  Laurena stopped and held the ankh closely to her.  Tryphaena had done horrible things, but no one deserved to die.  No matter what her cause.  But if she hadn't died, someone else would have...Azalea...or Aeli.<br>
<br>
Aeli killed her.  The fact struck her finally.  What bravery he had.  To shed blood.  She had never killed in all her life.  He killed for Azalea, for her.  To save them. To save himself.  But he had killed.  He had protected.  And Laurena had let herself forget him.  Her heart panged with guilt.<br>
<br>
People died--and risked their lives--because of her foolishness.<br>
<br>
She started to walk along again, but now she collected shells.  Mussel shells, scraped of their hosts, black as night.  She collected a number, making sure they were beautiful and unbroken.<br>
<br>
Laurena then looked up and saw Aeli coming toward her direction, not too far away.  She stopped and looked at him for a moment, the sight of him filling her with relief.  But she could find no words for him.  Instead, she turned direction, away from him, and stepped into the gentle waters that were slightly rough now with high tide.  Kneeling down, she remained there, and plucked a strand of her thick hair from her head.  And she began to tie the mussel shells together into a necklace.  Her spirit lacked luster, but she knew this was right.<br>
<br>
She had to mourn Trpyphaena.  A death necklace would honor her.  After all, no matter how horrid she had been, she had been a living being.<br>
<br>
She sang for her as she weaved the necklace.<br>
<br>

The siren girl watched him leave.  &quot;O...ok...&quot; she looked at the man, emboldened by the fact that he seemed airly friendly.  &quot;I know where you can find...um...alkihol,&quot; she stumbled over the word.  &quot;Strawberry wine.
