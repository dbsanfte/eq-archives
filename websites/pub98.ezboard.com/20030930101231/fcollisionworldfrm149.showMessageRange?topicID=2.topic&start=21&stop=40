<br>
The glow from Enari's double blades faintly lit up the room.<br>
At the otherside was a large door leading to the hallway in which the footsteps were coming. <br>
<br>
'how many do  you say?&quot; Marth asked Enari.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd say 40... 50 if we're lucky.&quot; He grinned at Marth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's kick some ghunien ass!&quot; Marth said, lunging on the first one that came through the doorway.<br>
<br>
He quickly stabbed the ghunien through the chest, the pullled his sword back out.<br>
<br>
Enari narrowed his eyes and tightened his grip as 10 more ran into the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;This should be easy, since last week i killed 20 myself.&quot; He calmly stated with a  mischeivious look on his face.<br>

<br>
&quot;Ew... ugly...&quot; she muttered, holding onto the chain. She heard something crack, and looked up to the ceiling, where the chain was holding up the chandelier. The chain was breaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh oh...&quot; she said to herself. The chain finally broke completely. She closed her eyes, held onto the part of the chain she had been holding onto quite tightly. The chandelier fell and landed on about three of the ugly little monsters.<br>

<br>
<br>
the ghunien were tall, about 7 feet tall. thier skin was of a pale clammy appearance. They had no nose, just little holes to breath from. thier ears were long and hooked. Big black round eyes glowed faintly in the dark and thier long needle like teeth showed when they hissed.<br>
<br>
two of the tried to get Enari in a deathlock, but he ducked and jumped... sailing over about 5.<br>
<br>
He charged at one of them, who tried to block. Enari caught on and ran to the side at the last second,  slasing him in the side, slicing it in half.<br>
<br>
He pointed his left sword, glacier, up...immediately a chilly breeze flowed through the room. An eerie light surrounded two of the ghunien, then it seemed to harden, trapping them in a frozen block of ice.<br>
<br>
He grinned evily at  the last 2 who were charging towards  him... he was trapped but he also had a few tricks up his sleeves. enari ran to the walk, running up the side then did aback  flip, landing behind the 2 who were charging at him.<br>
<br>
Running at them, dodging another who had been thrown his way (Marth's doing), he quickly sped past them.<br>
The stood there a moment, glaring at enari... then they fell in half.<br>
<br>
&quot;Geeze Enari, didn't know you were that fast..&quot;<br>
Marth had been working his way through another 5 who had wandered in the room... ghunien heads laid everywhere around him. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

She stomped on it really hard before taking a few steps away from the chandelier.<br>
<br>
She tripped on one of the ghunein heads, and landed, hard, on her hands and knees, in a puddle of black blood, which splashed up on her.<br>
<br>
&quot;OW! ...ew... this is gross...&quot; she muttered, lifting a hand and looking at it. The sight of blood had always made her sick. Being in a puddle of blood, BLACK blood, had a totally different affect on her.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, her world was black. <p>~*~<br>

<br>
&quot;Okay. We can go.&quot; she said. &quot;Do you want this back, Marth...? It's aweful bloody...&quot; Virgo said, holding up Marth's cape. &quot;I know! I can wash it for you when we get to a spring!&quot; she said, smiling. <p>~*~<br>

<br>
<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
Enari kept walking... what a journey this has been so far. First teleporting to the high-tech side of the world. Finding Kirin and leading her to the forest. Then those stupid interring bastards who had called upon the thunder dragon... and given him a good zap. After running into a ghunien camp, dealing with Marth, then having an angel follow him... the shadows and now these elven tunnels infested with ghunien and who knows what kind of other creatures...He was incredibly weak now. He couldn't even use his medium power spells. His fighting was sloppy... and his speed was terrible.<br>
He had better find the crystal staff soon. <br>
