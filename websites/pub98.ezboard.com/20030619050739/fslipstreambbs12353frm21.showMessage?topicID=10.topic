So sorry folks, I'm caught in the middle, and both groups are on my mind:<br>
<br>
I think it was wrong, dead wrong, of Christian and Lisa to close the Slipstream because they're &quot;not getting anything out of the Slipstream&quot;. Sorry, this should have been a group decision, including those of us (like me) who paid money to help this board. I don't think contributing money gives me any say in how a board is run, but it does give me a say in whether the board is shut down. This is wrong, I want slipstreambbs.com up and running. I want my money's worth!<br>
<br>
I understand there was a hacker attack posting improper images on the slipstreambbs. I condemn this without reservation and am glad I do not know who it was who did that, because I'd damn well turn them in for such a despicable act. No matter what your political disagreement with a board, that's far worse than anything the slipstream did to offend you in the first place. <br>
<br>
There was a separate (from all appearances) ongoing effort to unlock the Officer's Quarters on the slipstream, and archive those threads for all to see. While I disagree with the intent behind this, it's not as bad as the above. It was wrong, but gladly, it backfired because posting those archives really didn't show anything heinous.<br>
<br>
I read every month archived on the Officer's Quarters, focusing on threads where I or people I wanted to read about came up. In my opinion, whomever posted these threads for the purpose of &quot;exposing&quot; what was being said, failed. The threads were a great testament to the honest and integrity of the moderators, the threads I read showed me good people trying their best to moderate to the rules given them, nothing more. I saw discussions on whether it would get any easier to issue warnings, the stress over regular runins with certain posters (myself included) and so forth. No smoking guns here, I learned a little more about the workings of a message board, and have gained new respect for those who WORKED FOR FREE in this regard.<br>
<br>
I was not singled out by name and made fun of, as apparently some other posters were. But let's say I was, let's say a moderator said in OQ that &quot;Ogami is a pinhead, and a subliterate one at that&quot;. So what? It's a private musing, people do that all the time. It's not enough for me to throw a fit over, and start acting self-righteous about what was being said in the OQ. I honestly believe that Christian and Lisa may not have closed the slipstream if these threads attacking the moderators hadn't been started in the first place. <br>
<br>
I ask those who were offended by what was said in the Officer's Quarters to cool their outrage, and rise above it. For example, have any of you said things to your friends about co-workers, things you would not say to that co-workers face? Unless any of you can make that claim, do not cast any stones. This was a big ado over nothing.<br>
<br>
It was wrong of the moderators to make personal comments about posters, it was wrong of for whomever to post the contents of the Officer's Quarters threads. But these are both minor offenses, neither offense is worth closing the board over. I think both sides overreacted, and we are where we are now because of it.<br>
<br>
Not taking sides will doubtless not win me any popularity awards. I take the sides of the posters who were deprived a message board because of the selfishness of those who closed the board, and the selfishness of those who feigned outrage they were made fun of on a private discussion. Who cares on either count?  <br>
<br>
I am fully prepared to make Slipstream Underground my permanent message board for good. I would rather like to have two boards instead of one, but I guess we'll have to wait and see what Lisa does with the other one. The ball's in her court.<br>
<br>
That's my piece,<br>

<br>
First, a lot of the outrage that is expressed here is not necessarily so much &quot;Wahhh....they said this about me&quot; but more the fact that Admin and Mods were double dealing when it came to select posters...<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>HF</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is the one that comes to mind.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Lil</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is another.<br>
<br>
Now I didn't read the QSF threads that were reactions to the OQ files, but I can imagine what some were saying.  Maybe it was childish of them to react so, but it's understandable, and given mass mentality, almost predictable.<br>
<br>
Personally, I was outraged by the slack treatment of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FMD</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and his situation...of which I had a personal part...in relation to the out and out conspiracy to keep <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>HF</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> off the board permenantly.  Double standard, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FMD</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> was certainly a worse human being than <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Foolie</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ever was.<br>
<br>
Have people overreacted to the OQ Files?  Oh, sure.  Did we need to see them?  Yes.  I don't believe ignorance is bliss.  I also don't believe that every one of the Mods were rotten bitches and bastards.  Many are great people,  but what was going on behind closed doors was wrong...pure and simple. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ladymeanoiche>Lady Meanoiche</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(1/17/03 6:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://marina.fortunecity.com/shark/133/goth3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My thoughts on the ENTIRE cataclysm</span><hr size=1> I'm sorry but I have to disagree here. What was said about me back there , hell what was said about others back there, was shameful. Will I be angry about it forever? Probably not but my anger is genuine and I have a right to feel that way.<br>
<br>
As for who to blame for the old Slipstream closing there are only two people to blame here and those are the people who actually closed the board. Nobody forced them to do it. Lisa could've talked about the situation, the option was always there. I tried to get people to offer constructive suggestions on what should've happened next but Lisa decided that mature discussion wasn't on the cards.<br>
<br>
And FTR I can't speak for anyone else that was upset about the content of the OQ threads but personally I tend to speak my mind. Have I said things I've later regretted? Of course I have but to put it in a nutshell I prefer to say things to people's faces rather than behind their backs like that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ogami1>Ogami1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(1/17/03 6:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~jo567779/toocute.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My thoughts on the ENTIRE cataclysm</span><hr size=1> Thanks, THP.<br>
<br>
As far as double-standards and such, we'd have to discuss the moderating of every single poster before the Slipstream community hashed out that argument. It's an impossible task, best not to worry about it. Moderators have to make snap judgments, sometimes they're wrong. They're human is all I'm saying, and there's nothing in OQ that's changed my opinion in that regard.<br>
<br>
I would liken what went on in the OQ with the people who review videotapes sent in the AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS. The people looking at the submissions may roll their eyes, they may ridicule the submissions they see, in ways they wouldn't were the people in the room with them. That's the position moderators are in, and it doesn't matter a whit to me whether those comments get back to the original person.<br>
<br>
To be blunt, if people are a frequent topic of conversation in OQ, a cursory reading will show the poster themselves merited it by drawing attention to themselves. There's no way around that. I myself am mentioned in OQ once for trolling and once for flaming. I can't recall the incidents, but there's a good change I posted something out of the ordinary to warrant the attention. How could I then be outraged at reading what they wrote of me at the time? I can't. It's simply not relevant or important.<br>

<br>
I'll give you just 3 of the reasons that I was highly irate just to keep it fairly short.<br>
<br>
1) NJ.  Plain and simple.  I spent over a year of my life driving a semi truck across the United States in big hairy circles.  In this time I cut myself off from the internet completely and I cut myself off from my friends and family with the exception of the occasional phone call.  I stayed out on the road for two months at a time, without a day off.  I worked my ass into the ground.  I kept enough for myself to eat.  The rest I gave to my best friend at the time NJ.  Overall I estimate that I gave her in the neighborhood of $20,000 in that year.  All this time NJ was my best friend...  I called her once or twice a week and we would talk about everything.  <br>
<br>
After a long while I managed to get myself a cheap laptop for $300 which I could use on rare occasions to connect to the net.  I began to do so.  I noted how much everything had changed.  I began to question this change and I dared to stand up to the moderators who had suddenly begun to act like little dictators in their own private fiefdoms.  I got myself warned intentionally, repeatedly standing up to these people.  What was it to me?  I usually couldn't get online except for maybe once or twice a week anyway.  So I bucked the system.  Not because I'm an asshole, but because I saw so many things that were just wrong.  <br>
<br>
Jaimie took the time that I was gone to turn the Roleplay forum into some sort of live action story forum in which she was the only one allowed to narrate.  Everyone had to follow her lead in lead and it was an overly restrictive lead indeed that completely violated the spirit of roleplay.  I won't get into that arguement again here.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Well shortly after that NJ was made a moderator.  I wished her well grudgingly.  Moderators have a tendency to hate me for some reason  ~efg~ and I thought I might be losing a friend.  I was pleasantly surprised that she remained my fast friend on the phone.  We continued to talk about everything under the sun, including the board and some of what NJ knew about the back room politics from her place in the OQ.  NJ left out one important fact in our talks...  She was no longer my friend, if indeed she ever was.  She never told me about the nasty spiteful things that she said about me... Instead she was always pleasant, always praising me for being such a good guy and always thanking me for my help and my money.  As she trashed me in the OQ for anything and everything.  When the Rp debate went down NJ told me that Lisa told her what to say in her posts to me in the RP forum.  She said that she never wanted to warn me at all and that she was on my side in this thing.  We even mutually ridiculed Lisa's attempts at joining a RP debate in which she knew NOTHING about.  While she sat in the OQ telling everyone what a nasty, evil person I was...<br>
<br>
That goes beyond doing one's job Ogami.  That is as low as it goes in my book.  In due time I married Lady Midnight and I told NJ that I could not help her anymore.  I had to look after my wife and my daughter now...  After all the help I gave her, suddenly she didn't have much time for me at all.  Then the fight in QSF concerning her broke out...  I was still righteously steamed at the way NJ had treated me.  I had told my wife what NJ had said and done.  She was after all my wife and NJ wasn't even a friend.  That whole mess was just bad...  It truly showed how NJ was, not at the time, because NJ rode it all out in OQ.  Calling me every spiteful name in the book.  Lying, trying to ruin my good name to save her crappy little Admin job that pays nothing.  <br>
<br>
Gotta love the gratitude there.<br>
<br>
OK on to reason 2.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I bet you wish you'd never brought it up now...  :P<br>
<br>
Ahh hell...<br>
<br>
I'll cut you some slack...<br>
<br>
I have more than two more reasons that are just as compelling, but screw it.  This one is more than enough for the bile this stirred in me.<br>
<br>
I never said any of this at the Slipstream because I left the day before all this went down.<br>
<br>
There was nothing going on at the SS to warrant that shut down.  People were talking about feeling betrayed, moderators were apologizing and people were attempting to move on.  How is that a board out of control?<br>
<br>
Well the fact that threads from the TrakBBS briefing room cannot be discussed at TrekBBS might give you a clue.  Lisa did not want that stuff discussed, even when it was done calmly and people were healing.  That was the reason she shut down the board. Through Jidimus she tried to tell everyone to stop discussing it or be warned for it.  The people ignored her completely.  That was our crime against Lisa.  She wasn't in complete control.  So she locked everyone out.<br>
<br>
Lisa might have had an arguement for the shut down if I had been in that QSF.  At that time my anger was unmatched.  I would have shown no mercy...<br>
<br>

<br>
I know this wasn't easy, I appreciate you taking the time to read the thoughts of someone who was left wondering what was going on. I learned the events of the shutdown a piece at a time, although I think I have a pretty good picture now. (On the day SS was closed, I had posted on about 12 topics earlier that day, and was caught totally by surprise at the furor that must be been argued later.)<br>
<br>
#1) I'd like to think there's something more behind a row behind you and NJ that is the reason I'm without a board now. Couldn't your differences have been handled via private email? <br>
<br>
&quot;I began to do so. I noted how much everything had changed. I began to question this change and I dared to stand up to the moderators who had suddenly begun to act like little dictators in their own private fiefdoms.&quot;<br>
<br>
Always been this way from the very first day I started posting (in the middle of the First Season). I never noticed a change, I have never been on a board as stridently moderated as the Slipstream always was. And I've been on the receiving end of moderator ire since day one, I would have noticed a change.<br>
<br>
#2) I have seen this posted by a few others, that the threads in question where the posters confronted the moderators about their OQ comments were going well, bridges were being rebuilt, apologies were flowing back and forth, and the board was closed anyway. Why?<br>
<br>
It's possible Lisa was simply looking for an excuse, any excuse, to close down the slipstream, and this was it. Perhaps it wasn't the straw that broke the camel's back, maybe she was looking for a bale of hay big enough to do the job. I don't know, because I haven't gotten any response from her or Christian. If this speculation of mine is the case, then Slipstream Underground is our new permanent home, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Perhaps some good can come of this. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
&quot;Lisa did not want that stuff discussed, even when it was done calmly and people were healing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well then it's her loss, we'll move on. And I better understand your perspective on this. Understand my perspective that I allow for the possibility that moderators (and people on the internet) may say things about me that they don't say to my face. This is hardly shocking news, especially in your case where you proudly note that &quot;I got myself warned intentionally, repeatedly standing up to these people.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stand by my view that both sides over-reacted, and now we no longer have a board because of pride on both sides.<br>

<br>
Looks like Lisa has decided this for me, she's chosen sides for me. It's cowardly to close down that board under these circumstances, if you believe you're right you re-open the board and let us hash out our differences. You don't kill debate by killing the message board entirely.<br>
<br>
I can no longer give the benefit of a doubt to those who run, scuse me, ran the SlipstreamBBS. They were wrong, the posters that felt aggrieved were right.<br>
<br>
I will add that I hope moderators from that board and everyone else we knew will join us here as open and equal members.<br>
<br>
HeroicFool, I specifically apologize for questioning you on this.<br>

I just didn't want any lingering questions before starting over with this new board, and am happy to see that's not the case. We get a fresh start, and no annoying ads to boot!<br>
