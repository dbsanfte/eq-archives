I think you soon discover I take lots of &quot;stands&quot; if you haven't already.  I simply avoid the use of labels since they don't fit me well.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;By not taking any actual position, you can avoid criticism and the pitfalls of bad dogma.<br>
<br>
You'll find I have my own set of beliefs which you are free to critique.  I am however an individual and I'd rather you critique my beliefs rather than your opinions about religion.  See the difference?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, thiesm is a dogmatic belief in a revealed god,<br>
<br>
Based on my own personal life experiences, and the experiences of others in the society in which I live.  I share my theism with 80-90 percent of humanity by the way.  How do you support you faith in atheism?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;so to be a theist, you have to have some 'knowledge' of this deity. <br>
<br>
Indeed I do.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I really think you'll find deism more to your tastes if you investigate it.<br>
<br>
I think at the age of 42, having been a &quot;Christian&quot; and an &quot;atheist&quot; in my life I pretty much know what works for me thanks.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; It abandons the dogma and argues from a rational view based on what can be claimed to be known of gods nature.<br>
<br>
Can you empirically demonstrate love or consciousness?  Are these &quot;real&quot;?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;For example, look at the creation. A deist would see the world as proof of gods activities, and argue from there against the revealed religons, for example xianity, based upon their claims of gods nature not coinciding with the evidence.<br>
<br>
In that sense I'd be comfortable with that label in this particular case.  As I said however, these labels don't fit upon closer scrutiny of my beliefs.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Further example, the world is a beautifully complex and dynamic environement, arguing that as the work of god, the bible then breaks down and becomes unsupportable as one of gods works for not being beautiful and dynamic, but rather clumsy and self contradictory. You go to great lengths to espouse a claim to gods existance, then disavow all acceptance of religions. Absent a religion, you cease to be a theist. Look into it. <br>
<br>
I'd urge you to judge my beliefs based on what I say rather than your own prejudices towards labels.

sounds reasonable.  i guess in my case there are just a few more experiences to be had before i can just &quot;let go&quot;<br>
<br>
i was actually hospitalized a couple of months ago (the day before thanksgiving) and i had no such NDE experience.  i wonder why NDEs are not reproducible and why i myself didn't have one.<br>
<br>
i guess this calls for more speculation...<br>

<br>
To be honest, I am a little disappointed, I thought you were a precocious youth wrestling with the religion thing and thinking they had it all worked out.  Not some middle aged brawler looking for a scrap.  [Kind of like in the Blues Brothers, &quot;We have both kinds of music here, country AND western!&quot;  I have been both kinds of person, xian AND atheist!]  But oh well.  It looks from here like you avoid the use of 'labels' as you put it so that you don't have to actually hold a position.  You do not bother with the trivialities of language like agreeing on what words mean and resort to obfuscating about their significance or other diversionary tactics rather than address something directly. <br>
<br>
I am an atheist because the evidence does not support the existence of a god, certainly not the revealed god of the theists.  However it doesn’t rule out the possibility of the god of deists though.  I do not need the comfort of &quot;share(ing) my theism with 80-90 percent of humanity by the way&quot; to feel secure in my beliefs either.  Not so very long ago in the grand scheme most of humanity thought the world was flat too.  I see all the damages that theism has wrought upon the world and find it an unnecessary limitation on us as a species and horribly cruel overall.<br>
<br>
SO, please share with us your beliefs.<br>

 If you define Spiritual as believing in a god? Then yes.<br>

You enter into the board with thinly veiled derisions and act surprised when they come back to you?<br>
<br>
You are quite a character there DBC.  I really haven't engaged anyone besides yourself in any real topics of conversation, so I'm not sure where you figure I'm deriding anyone.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; It is very easy Michael to 'take a stand' when all you do is throw rocks at a position but do not offer one of your own to defend.<br>
<br>
That does seem to be the way most atheists operate.  I take stands.  I believe in a creator, remember?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; It really isn't taking a stand at all, only being contrary and argumentative, hit and run if you will.<br>
<br>
I didn't hit and run.  I'm still here.  I'm still chatting with folks.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I further doubt that we will find your set of beliefs because, aside from mentioning a dislike for religion and a belief in god (with implications that they are based on experience) you really haven't offered any. <br>
<br>
And yet already you've begun to give me suggestions on room for improvement?  You don't see the irony in that?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;So please, do explain to us your beliefs.<br>
<br>
I believe in God.  I don't believe in hell.  I do believe in love.  I do believe in consciousness.  Can I emperically demonstrate any of these things?  I suppose it depends on what constitutes &quot;evidence&quot; and what you reject as evidence.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Why for example were you a xian,<br>
<br>
I was handed that dogma package as a child.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;what prompted your fall into atheism and what shook you free from its terrible grasp?<br>
<br>
I simply recognized the hypocricy of a religion that professed God was love and tortured beings for the whole of time.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Just what are these experiences that convince you the G man is watching? <br>
<br>
Why do you wish to know?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;(Please do not reveal intimate details of your life if you can avoid it, this is the internet after all.)<br>
<br>
I'm not convinced there is any legitimate reason to share them with you at this point in time.  Perhaps you could enlighten me as to the purpose of your knowing such things?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;To be honest, I am a little disappointed, I thought you were a precocious youth wrestling with the religion thing and thinking they had it all worked out. <br>
<br>
Sorry I didn't fit your bill.  I'm 43, happily married, with two children.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Not some middle aged brawler looking for a scrap. <br>

Brawler?  How so?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;[Kind of like in the Blues Brothers, &quot;We have both kinds of music here, country AND western!&quot; I have been both kinds of person, xian AND atheist!] But oh well. It looks from here like you avoid the use of 'labels' as you put it so that you don't have to actually hold a position. <br>
<br>
I think you're being intentionally disengenious since I've clearly revealed more of my &quot;beliefs&quot; and taken more of a stance than you have since I've been here.  What makes you judge, jury and exocutioner anyway?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You do not bother with the trivialities of language like agreeing on what words mean and resort to obfuscating about their significance or other diversionary tactics rather than address something directly. <br>
<br>
You're the one who intentionally misrepresented Einstein as an atheist against his express wishes and clear rejection of that particular theology.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I am an atheist because the evidence does not support the existence of a god, certainly not the revealed god of the theists. <br>
<br>
You mean &quot;in your opinion&quot; it does not.  That's still nothing more than a statement of faith if you ask me.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;However it doesn’t rule out the possibility of the god of deists though.<br>
<br>
Well, at least you aren't a hopeless cause. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I do not need the comfort of &quot;share(ing) my theism with 80-90 percent of humanity by the way&quot; to feel secure in my beliefs either.<br>
<br>
The fact your views represent such a tiny minority of human beliefs should make you wonder why you feel it's valid to believe that your own lack of personal experiences of God can be extrapolated across society as a whole don't you think?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Not so very long ago in the grand scheme most of humanity thought the world was flat too.<br>
<br>
Can you empirically demonstrate this statement or is that a statement of faith too?  The Mayans certainly never thought that.  They had a calendar that was more precise than the ones we use today and their grasp of astronomy was amazing.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I see all the damages that theism has wrought upon the world and find it an unnecessary limitation on us as a species and horribly cruel overall.<br>
<br>
Ya, and Stalin and Lenin and Pol Pot were perfect examples of free thinkers too.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;SO, please share with us your beliefs.<br>

<br>
I think we need to distinguish the difference between a loss of consciousness and actual physical death.  I don't even dream every night, or every time I take a nap. I don't know why I dream or why I don't dream on any particular night.<br>
<br>
My assumption would be that there would really only be a need for someone to have such an experience if the intent was to create some sort of change in their life because of this experience.  It should be noted that not EVERYONE has an NDE that has been recessitated.  I can't answer why that might be, I can only speculate that either they aren't invited to heaven, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  or more likely that they just had no particular need of that experience at that time.

Huh?  Einstein clearly DIDN'T share all of my views.  It's just seems only fair to me that he not be misrepresented by folks like you when he specifically denied he was an atheist and said that he resented being associated with the idea.  You don't seem to care if you misrepresent him.  I think he would.  In fact he said so and I showed you the quote now about a dozen times!  HINT!<br>

Whether or not you can roast a single persons, or several peoples beliefs is irrelevent.  Can you prove there is no creator or not?  Yes or no?<br>

My obsession?  I wasn't the one defending some bizarre statement about atheists being more intelligent than theists was I?  Wasn't that you and mama?<br>

&gt;&gt;I don't recall ever mentioning how smart I may or may not be, nor do I see it's relevance.<br>
<br>
You seem to think you have it all figured out and 80-90 percent of humanity is just nuts.  I'm curious how you arrived at such a conclusion based purely on ignorance alone?<br>
<br>
On top of that you started defending mama's nonsense about atheists have higher IQ's than theists.  Of course neither one of you cops to the fact that Einstein rejected atheism altogether and believed in a creator.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I did rebutt your observation on atheist ignorance with the fact that more intelligent people are atheists, <br>
<br>
Why?  Where's your proof at that ridiculous statement?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;but I never laid claim to being smarter myself.<br>

<br>
&quot;Life after death sure. Jesus said the kingdom of heaven was found within however. What do you suppose he meant by that, or hadn't you bothered to even consider the idea?&quot;<br>
<br>
I have pondered the idea and actually prefer the concepts of heaven and hell that rely on being with or apart from god as more mature than actual physical clouds or pits of coals, but that's another thread. My question here is--are you xian then Michael? Do you accept Jesus Christ as your personal lord and savior?<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you prove there is no creator or not? Yes or no?&quot;<br>
<br>
DBC already went over this. No. Noone can prove a negative, but see my post in the other thread on what you can have from me if you do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course neither one of you cops to the fact that Einstein rejected atheism altogether and believed in a creator.&quot;<br>
<br>
I never commented at all on Einstein rejecting atheism, though yes, I would call him a deist. I thought for much of my youth that he was Jewish--who cares? The data I showed does not contend that every single theist is stupid or that most are, nor does  it say every atheist is intelligent, just that on the whole atheists are more intelligent, etc. than theists. <br>
<br>
&quot;Where's your substance. Where's your science proving that there is no creator, or is that opinion just blind faith on your part?&quot;<br>
<br>
I've addressed this several times, but since you love the phrase &quot;blind faith&quot; I assume you have no problems with the fact that you have blind faith there is no Santa, Tooth Fairy or Conrad the Magic Purple Invisible Carp?<br>
