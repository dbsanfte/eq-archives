<br>
Aunt Petunia was staring out of the kitchen window again. Of course, she usually spent the better part of the morning spying on whatever activity there was on Privet Drive (which wasn't much at all) but this morning she was positively glued to the windowpane. A moving van had been parked next door all morning, and the moment she'd been waiting for had finally arrived.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vernon!&quot; she cried, waving her pink dishcloth in the air, &quot;Come look, quick! They've just pulled up!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry Potter had always thought that his Aunt's busy-bodying was perhaps her worst flaw, aside from her raging temper. But as he stood at the sink, drying the last of the dishes, even he had to raise his eyes out of curiosity, pressing his glasses at the bridge firmly to get a good look.<br>
<br>
A deep maroon Renault had pulled into the next door driveway and out stepped--<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, but they're young aren't they? I do hope they won't be bringing any bad habits into this neighborhood! Look at the state of their car--filthy!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps they've had a long drive. They can't be all that young, Petunia--that daughter of theirs must be at least Dudley's age.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is that woman wearing? Such loud colors--foreign, I expect.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was trying to get a better look, but his Aunt and Uncle's backsides seemed quite opposed to his attempts. Uncle Vernon whipped around, his red face in a fury at seeing Harry standing so close to him. Indeed, Uncle Vernon's distaste for the boy had reached the point where even being within the immediate vicinity of Harry made him cringe.<br>
<br>
&quot;The dishes, boy!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm finished...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then what are you standing about for? Didn't your Aunt tell you that she needed the weeds pulled in the flowerbed?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right this minute?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As good a time as any, I'd say!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry wrinkled his nose in annoyance, but knew better than to protest. He turned and trudged out of the kitchen, mentally flipping through a list of charms he would have simply loved to cast on his Uncle at that moment.<br>
<br>
If the Underage Wizarding Law hadn't been so strictly enforced, he would have done so in a heart beat. But since it would have meant his expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he decided against it.<br>
<br>
After all, it was Hogwarts that really felt like home, and never seeing it again sounded like a fate worse than death. If he would have been allowed to stay at Hogwarts for the summer holidays the world would have been a much rosier place-the Dursleys would have loved it as well-but Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore was adamant that Harry return home for the summer with the Dursleys. Especially after everything that had just happened the year before.<br>
<br>
Everything that happened. . .<br>
<br>
There wasn't a moment that went by that Harry wasn't plagued by the vivid memories of it all. Even as he crouched over his Aunt's pansies and wildflowers, struggling with the stubborn weeds overrunning the flowerbed, the images ran wildly through his head-a flush of color and cries and screams and horror. . . complete, absolute horror.<br>
<br>
It had been three months since that horrible day. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament had ended in unfathomable tragedy.<br>
<br>
Harry had seen his friend Cedric fall dead at his very feet, and he had watched, a helpless captive, as the evil Lord Voldemort, who had murdered Harry's parents when Harry was only one year old, regained power after years of near nonexistence.&quot;<br>
<br>
But Harry had escaped with his life, which is what he reminded himself as the sweat streamed down his brow, and his hands ached from the thorns and bristles on the weeds. He was alive.<br>
<br>
The Dursleys, of course, knew nothing of the tragedy, nor did they know that at night time whilst they snored in satisfied sleep, Harry often lay wide awake, tormented by the memory of it all. They didn't know of the nightmares that woke him from what rest he could get, seeing Cedric's face still as clear as though it were right before him. How easily that face could have been Harry's. When Voldemort's wand pointed at Harry's chest, he should have died. . . any other wizard would have. . . and yet he was still here.<br>
<br>
The Dursleys had never been close to their nephew, but even they had taken notice in a striking change in Harry's demeanor since his return home. He rarely smiled, kept to himself without having to be told, and was often given to long bouts of staring out the window with a dreamy look in his eyes. Harry even thought that once his cousin Dudley had come very close indeed to asking him what he was thinking about all the time-but thought the better of it.<br>
<br>
The less the Dursleys knew about Harry, the more normal they felt things would be.<br>
<br>
Harry was thrown out of his trance by voices carrying over the fence. He blinked, wondering who it could possibly be, and then remembered exactly what was going on. The new neighbors were in the backyard, surveying the lot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Still, Roger, it might be good for entertaining. With a little. . . well, with a lot of work, I think it should turn out quite smashingly. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Possibly. But I still wish we'd taken the home in Essex.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know that we had to move here because of my job. We've been through this already.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know Imelda, dear. I know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was still crouched over, not making a sound, straining to hear the conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure you'll love it here too, Cherub. Did you see your new school as we drove in?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry heard a young girls voice speak up with the same solemnity as her fathers'.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes . . . a bit dodgy, if you ask me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nonsense! It's one of the best in Surrey! And you'll be able to walk to it, you're so close. Oh, but we've left the movers inside! Come on you two, let's help.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry could hear the mother walk away briskly, the other two trailing her slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;She doesn't like it here either, does she Dad.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not in the slightest.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry stood up when they'd gone, stretching his side which was cramping and wiped his forehead with his shirt. He removed his glasses and wiped them clean and turned to take his bag of weeds to the rubbish bin, when he was nearly knocked down by a particularly smug-looking Dudley.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what are you so happy about,&quot; Harry snapped as he walked past Dudley, whose arms were crossed as he followed Harry's steps.<br>
<br>
&quot;See the new neighbors?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You will. They've got a daughter, you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I guess with your kind you don't notice normal things like girls.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was suddenly visited with a flash of memories: Parvati Patil's smile, Cho Chang's. . . everything, Fleur Delacour's flowing hair. Harry ended up repeating what he'd told his best friend Ron Weasley earlier that year.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, they make them okay at Hogwarts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dudley flinched and those last two syllables. When he found his voice, it was venomous,<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah! Warts on their noses, pointed hats and broomsticks-- real knockouts, I bet.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry subconsciously clenched his fist as Dudley's sinister laugh filled the yard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, maybe you'll see what you're missing at that freak school of yours once you get a look at the new girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry slammed the lid to the rubbish bin closed and scowled at Dudley as he waddled away. If there was one thing that bothered Harry more than anything about the Dursleys, it when they called his school a 'freak place.' Anything that Harry liked the Dursleys made a specific point of stepping all over: Hogwarts, his friends-his parents, even.<br>
<br>
In years past, Dudley would have been a bit more vicious in his taunting of Harry, but things had changed recently: one, because Harry's godfather Sirius Black was known in both muggle and wizarding worlds alike as a vicious serial killer, so Dudley was more than careful not to really tick Harry off. And the second reason was because within the past few months, Harry had grown a good four inches at least. So even though Dudley outweighed Harry by a great margin, Harry was now a good deal taller than Dudley. Dudley, of course, would never admit it openly, but the fact that he now had to look up at his cousin was most unnerving.<br>
<br>
Harry, meanwhile, was more than annoyed that all of his clothes no longer fit him: quite frankly, he looked silly with his trousers up to his shins and shirt sleeves nearly at his elbow. Aunt Petunia, however, was in no such disposition to buy him more clothes and since all of Dudley's old clothes were too large and too short for him, he simply had to make do.<br>
<br>
At dinner, he was vaguely aware of the conversation between his Aunt and Uncle (&quot;Not sure I like the look of them, if you know what I mean. Haven't even popped by to introduce themselves. . .&quot;). He was occupied with staring at the unappetizing cold plate of left-over spaghetti Aunt Petunia had pulled out from the refrigerator-- the rest of them dined on chicken and mashed potatoes-- and letting his mind fall on the only things that kept his spirits from dying out completely: Ron and Hermione.<br>
<br>
His two best friends in the world. And the only two things that he missed so much that his heart literally ached in their absence. Well . . . them and Quidditch. His sleek, trusty Firebolt was hidden beneath a slat in his bedroom at that very moment and he would have loved nothing more than to jump on and go for a fly-- it was the only time that he felt completely safe. Completely happy.<br>
<br>
But both the Dursley's and the Ministry of Magic wouldn't have liked that all too much.<br>
<br>
After another wordless meal -- he might as well not have even existed while he was at 4 Privet Drive -- he cleared the plates, washed them in silence, wiped down the kitchen and then trudged back upstairs for his room. He was half hoping to see Dobby the house-elf on his bed, waiting for him as he had three years ago. Or maybe his beautiful Hedwig would have a package waiting for him from Ron or Hermione. But his bed was empty, and Hedwig was sleeping peacefully, her white feathers glowing beneath the bright moonlight.<br>
<br>
The quiet was consuming and depressing. It was rather like a Dementor being nearby, the coldness of the moment.<br>
<br>
'The Dementors will join us, they are our natural allies. We will recall the banished giants, I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me. . .'<br>
<br>
He shook Voldemort's cackling, high pitched wail out of his head, hoping perhaps tonight he might get a good night's rest. And maybe, just maybe, he would wake up in the morning in his dormitory, walk with Ron down to breakfast, laugh with Hermione and Seamus, catch a glimpse of Cho on the way down to potions, and say a brief hello to a smiling Cedric-- because maybe what happened three months ago was really another nightmare and he was just having a hard time waking up . . .<br>
<br>
The next two mornings brought more window peering on all three of the Dursley's behalves-- Dudley was suddenly just as intrigued as his parents at the new arrivals. Harry let them make meddling fools out of themselves and concerned himself with the newspaper. Harry had learned from Dumbledore that it was surprising how much information one could gain about the going-ons in the wizarding world from Muggle newspapers. Harry cracked a smile when he read Mysterious Fireworks Display in Twickenham-- Attempted Arson Suspected. That was most certainly good old Dedalus Diggle up to his old tricks again. He was almost positive that Diggle would be getting a strongly worded letter from the Ministry of Magic very soon. And then he nearly jumped out of his seat when he turned the page and found a picture of his very own godfather! A sinister, terribly unbecoming photo of him with the heading :<br>
<br>
Sirius Black Still at Large:<br>
<br>
LONDON. Police authorities say that the reported sighting of feared serial killer Sirius Black has been confirmed. Black was spotted near Vauxhall Road, London late Friday evening. By the time authorities arrived, Black had disappeared and although his whereabouts at this time are still unknown, police stress that all children should remain indoors and within immediate sight of a guardian. . .<br>
<br>
Well that meant there was going to be one large dog running about London for a while!<br>
<br>
But what was Sirius doing in London anyway? It wasn't too far from Surrey-- perhaps he was on his way to pay him a visit! The thought of seeing him again lifted Harry's spirits, but then he realized that with every man woman and child on the lookout for him (including the Dursleys) there wasn't much chance of it.<br>
<br>
The newspaper was ripped out of his hands and he looked up to see Aunt Petunia's rigid, gaunt face glaring at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;How dare you ignore your Uncle Vernon when he's talking to you! Of all the disrespectful, spiteful, vicious things to do to someone--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry Aunt Petunia, I didn't hear--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't interrupt your Aunt,&quot; Uncle Vernon bellowed from where he sat in the living room. And Harry remembered that he was dealing with the Dursleys. There were no such things as apologies in that household.<br>
<br>
Harry blinked for a moment and then turned around to give his Uncle complete eye contact, his mouth shut tightly.<br>
<br>
Uncle Vernon resumed rocking his recliner and spoke in gruff, pointed sentences. &quot;Your Aunt Petunia, cousin and I are going on Holiday. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm hallucinating. He can't have just said that they're going on a holiday . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;. . . to Majorca. We're leaving on Friday and won't be back for one week . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Impossible! The Dursley's! On a holiday! For a week!<br>
<br>
&quot;. . .we planned for Aunt Marge to house mind while we're away . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
No! Please! No, it can't be true. . .<br>
<br>
&quot;. . . but she'll be away in Scotland until September, so that leaves you. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Amazing! Fantastic! Unbelievable!<br>
<br>
Harry was trying his hardest not to grin brilliantly, for it was quite possibly the best news he'd ever been given in his life! One week without the Dursleys! One week alone! One week to finally be able to be whom he wanted and say what he wanted and do what he wanted!<br>
<br>
Uncle Vernon was still talking. &quot;. . . and if you think that you can just be who you want and say what you want and do what you want while we're away, then you're sorely mistaken, boy. Sorely mistaken. I've arranged it with the Mr. Banbury-- told him all about you and St. Brutus'. Oh, he knows all about you and he'll be watching. Like a hawk he'll be watching.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry wasn't threatened by this at all, merely intrigued. &quot;Who's Mr. Banbury?&quot;<br>
<br>
Uncle Vernon was visibly annoyed with having to answer a question. &quot;Mr. Banbury is our new neighbor, Harry. Met him just yesterday-- a logical, practical, sensible fellow who happens to work for the police, I might add.&quot; He smiled malevolently. &quot;Like I said: he'll be watching.&quot;<br>
<br>
Poor Mr. Dursley didn't understand that just three months ago Harry had dueled with the most feared dark Wizard in history: a policeman peering at him through lace windows wasn't going to scare him one bit.<br>
<br>
But he kept his face solemn and nodded understandingly as Uncle Vernon's threats kept flying, even though he wasn't listening. How could he, when in less than one week he wouldn't have to see the Dursleys anymore?<br>
<br>
&quot;And wipe that disgusting smile off your face,&quot; Vernon added.<br>
<br>
Harry tried. But the beauty of it all was just too much for him to bear! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://otaku-universe.com/~jake/stevensig.png" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgamingarea87.showUserPublicProfile?gid=born2kill2>Born2Kill2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>'Stevan-O-Licous'

<br>
Privet Drive was awakening to yet another quiet day beneath another dull gray sky, and for the first time in what felt like years, Harry slept right through it. It was only when he felt the floor boards quake from the Dursley's marching up and down the staircase that he was torn away from the wonderful, relaxing sleep. He stretched happily, and as he walked past his mirror was surprised to discover a grin upon his face. The grin faltered somewhat as he took in how his pajamas hung high above the ground and his shirt looked as though it had been shrunk in the wash, but he shook his head, knowing there was nothing he could do about it, and the grin returned.<br>
<br>
After he was dressed he came downstairs to find that breakfast had already been eaten and cleared away, and Aunt Petunia was eyeing him coldly. She could sense that Harry was in a good mood that morning, and the fact that he was smiling seemed to make her all the more determined to put a stop to it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, well. Sleeping Beauty's decided to grace us with his presence. Just in time to wash the car, right Vernon?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry heard a delighted grunt from the living room. His stomach was getting restless and he reached for a banana in a hanging basket, to which Aunt Petunia immediately objected.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm baking banana bread today, don't even think about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She was trying to pick a fight, most obviously, and he wasn't about to give her the pleasure of taking her up on it. Without saying another word, Harry turned and headed in the direction of the shed for some cleaning supplies. Aunt Petunia could bully him all she wanted, all he had to do was remind himself that within the week, she'd be gone.<br>
<br>
Outside, he rinsed the Dursley's car off with the garden hose and began soaping it up, when he heard a voice from behind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello? You're Harry, are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry whipped around and found Mr. Banbury standing ten feet from him, dressed in his policeman outfit, obviously getting ready to ride to work. He wasn't as young as the Dursley's had made him out to be, although there was definitely youthful vigor and spark in his deep brown eyes. His immediate reaction was what a kind face he had-- the sort that Harry would perhaps have liked to get to know better. Too bad, though, because Harry could only imagine the terrible things Uncle Vernon had said about him to Mr. Banbury.<br>
<br>
He lowered his eyes somewhat and answered timidly, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
To Harry's surprise, Mr. Banbury let out a smile. &quot;I was beginning to think that Mr. Dursley had made you up! Like to keep to yourself?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry shrugged and looked back down to the ground. He was beginning to get a bit nervous-- if Uncle Vernon saw him talking with their neighbor, who knows what he'd do to him. Best just keep washing the car, Harry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you and Dudley the same age?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's good, then-- nice to have someone your own age around. Poor Sophie, that's our girl, she only has herself and her cat Marwick.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry wasn't sure what Mr. Banbury wanted and raised his eyes to look at him, questioningly.<br>
<br>
Mr. Banbury cleared his throat. &quot;Yes, well, I must be off. But it was nice to meet you, Harry. We'll be seeing you tonight, of course.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry? Tonight?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr. Banbury seemed surprised. &quot;Yes, tonight! We've invited your family over to have a meal with us!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; Harry sighed. &quot;Them. Well, I'm sure that I'm not supposed to come--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nonsense! Of course you are! Imelda, that's my wife, would be most offended if you didn't come!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry didn't know what to say in reply! He wasn't used to muggles talking to him as though he didn't carry the Plague-- it was quite a strange feeling. He merely nodded in reply. That seemed to satisfy Mr. Banbury who hopped into his car and sped away.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, the Dursley's said nothing to him for the rest of the day about having dinner with the Banbury's. Harry decided that perhaps, just to be on the safe side, he'd put on his nicest set of clothes (the ones that didn't make him look like a complete clown) and even sat down in front of the mirror to attempt to tidy up his hair. Besides his startling green eyes, his second most striking feature was his great mop of black hair: it was unruly, never obeyed his brush, but as of late had grown into thick black locks that Harry could almost look upon without complete distaste. He'd wished so often that he could look, well, normal. It was really all Harry had ever wanted-- to be normal. But aside from his intense green eyes that he was keenly aware were quite distracting, his round glasses and stubbornly unruly hair, there was also a curious lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. It was a scar that, to his dismay, labeled him as a celebrity and would forever cement the fact that he, Harry Potter, was by no means normal at all.<br>
<br>
He usually tried his best to keep it covered beneath his hair, and he did so now before heading downstairs.<br>
<br>
The Dursley's were already at the door, Aunt Petunia holding a custard of some kind, Dudley dressed in his very finest-- Harry could even smell a whiff of cologne. Uncle Vernon pulled up his nose the minute he saw Harry reach the creaky bottom step.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come to see us off, have you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Mr. Banbury mentioned that he wanted me to--&quot;<br>
<br>
Aunt Petunia laughed a high, skin-crawling giggle. &quot;You think you're having dinner with us? With the Banbury's? Mr. Banbury is a very important man and we won't have him and his family exposed to people like you. Since you're so excited to have the house to yourself, you can start practicing now-- tonight. You're staying right here.&quot;<br>
<br>
They turned, Dudley sent a glaring look of satisfaction at his cousin and the door slammed behind him. Harry stood in the quiet of the hallway, actually disappointed that he couldn't accompany the Dursley's. Mr. Banbury had smiled at him. He'd tried to speak to him! And Harry had appreciated it and wanted to see him again. He'd turned and began to make his way slowly back up the stairs when the front door suddenly burst open again. Dudley stood in the doorway, his face red with anger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on, then.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dudley could hardly speak, he was so angry. &quot;You 'eard, come on. Hurry up, they'll be starting dinner soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry said nothing, but followed his cousin across the lawn and into number 3 Privet drive. Sinful aromas met him, a gust of lovely, warm air, and to his surprise Mrs. Banbury extending her hand to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, here he is! I'm Imelda Banbury, and you are?&quot;<br>
<br>
She was a pretty woman in her mid thirties, dressed in a bright lavender sun dress with matching shoes and matching pin in her short chestnut brown hair. Her almond brown eyes sparkled just as her husband's did and she shook his hand heartily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harry,&quot; he answered quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a pleasure, Harry. So you didn't want to come for dinner, eh? Well, you can go right back after you've finished eating, if you like. No sense in holding you here if you're not enjoying yourself! But come, let me-- oh there she is, Sophie! Sophie, this is Harry-- Dudley's cousin.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry knew why Dudley had been so intrigued with the Banbury's arrival. Sophie was absolutely lovely, a perfect blend of her mothers' physical beauty and her fathers' magnetic charm. In her arms was her black and white cat and she was grinning which made her deep-set brown eyes twinkle and a small dimple appear on her left cheek. She innocently pulled a stray strand of her long, thick brown hair back into place and carefully extended her hand so as not to disturb her cat.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm Sophie.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was sure that his mouth wasn't the only one that had fallen-- Dudley was standing directly next to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm Harry,&quot; he said calmly. He tried to think of something to say -- preferable something witty-- but nothing would come.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you go to Smeltings with Dudley, then?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then that means I'll be at your school! I'm going to Stonewall High as well. Glad that I'll actually know someone. It's really hard when--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Harry doesn't go to Stonewall,&quot; Dudley piped up quite gleefully, cutting her off.<br>
<br>
She raised her brow. &quot;Oh?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dudley was positively gloating, and Harry knew what was coming . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, no. They don't let his sort at Stonewall. He goes to St. Brutus'.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sophie stared at Harry in disbelief. Subconsciously, she took a step back. &quot;S-St. Brutus'?&quot;<br>
<br>
Really, it would have been much better if he'd just told her the truth: better for her to know that he was really a wizard instead of thinking that he was a serial killer in the making.<br>
<br>
&quot;W-well, er, that's quite . . . interesting, Harry. I bet it's very nice there . . .&quot; she attempted a feeble laugh. &quot;Worlds better than Stonewall, I'd wager.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her cat jumped out of her arms at that moment and approached Harry's feet, sniffing his shoes and then rubbing up against them, wrapping his tail about his ankle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow! He likes you, doesn't he! Marwick doesn't like anyone, except for--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Children? You're letting the dinner get cold! Come and sit!&quot; Mrs. Banbury had appeared right behind them and beckoned them to follow.<br>
<br>
They walked through the living room which was clean, every bit as orderly as Aunt Petunia's with lots of flowers and rugs and frames, and into their kitchen where a delectable feast was laid out and waiting for them.<br>
<br>
&quot;It looks gorgeous,&quot; said Petunia. &quot;How can you do it all what with working and whatnot?&quot; Petunia was obviously fishing for information.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Imelda as she sat down, &quot;I don't work. I'm more of a housewife, really.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh really? Well, that makes two of us then!&quot; Petunia laughed her fake laugh and Harry cringed as he always did when he heard it.<br>
<br>
Wait a minute-- a housewife? Harry remembered back to the other day when he'd specifically heard her tell her husband that the move had been due to her job. But he didn't have time to dwell on it, because he was in the process of being nudged out of a seat by Dudley.<br>
<br>
Dudley made sure he sat next to Sophie, and Harry ended up sitting at the far end of the table much to the happiness of the Dursley's. Uncle Vernon was going on to Mr. Banbury about something to do with law enforcement and out of control teenagers, Mrs. Banbury was listening most intently as Petunia went into detail about the recipe for her 'signature dessert' Pavlova, and Sophie was looking at Dudley, nodding in agreement as he dramatically re-counted an incident Harry had never heard of before which involved Dudley single-handedly breaking up a fight that nearly ended with Smelting's star football player in a body cast-- he promised he'd show her the certificate of merit he'd been awarded in recognition of his heroism.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was very brave of you, Dudley.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said gravely, &quot;well, that's just my way, Sophie. Doing unto others as I would have them do unto me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry choked on his glass of lemonade, trying hard not to fall into stitches of laughter. He'd choked so badly, that he'd unwittingly knocked over his cup and the lemonade poured onto the tablecloth. Dudley looked up and glared at him, as did the rest of the Dursley's.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Banbury was at once at his side, bending over to sop up the liquid.<br>
<br>
Harry was more than embarrassed. &quot;Oh, I-- I'm so sorry. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; she said airily as she pressed the washcloth against the wet fabric. &quot;It's just. . .&quot; her voice trailed as she turned her eyes back on Harry's face. Her breezy, carefree countenance flickered -- ever so quickly -- to one of complete shock. She cleared her throat and tried to smile again, but Harry was aware of a change in even her voice. &quot;It's. . . er, j-just one of those things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was at once put on guard by this odd change in her behavior, and what's more. . . Harry could have sworn that her eyes had lingered on his scar. She reached for the pitcher of lemonade, poured him another glass and then went back to her seat. She was decidedly quieter now, concentrating more on her food than anything else as Petunia rambled on.<br>
<br>
Uncle Vernon was still hounding Mr. Banbury about his serious concerns with law enforcement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well did you know what I read in the paper the other day? Remember that silly character who went on that rampage last month, robbing all those Woolworths stores? He was a ruddy teenager too and I can't believe, just can't ruddy believe, that the police can't track this kid down! He's going to strike again, you mark my words!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Vernon, I'll be the first to admit that Scotland Yard isn't at all proud of that. But we're a bit preoccupied at the moment, especially with the reappearance of Sirius Black. Now that's a criminal we've not seen the like of before. We've justnever come across a criminal before who is so. . . brilliant, really.&quot;<br>
<br>
The mention of Sirius Black's name sent a chill through the Dursley's. Uncle Vernon tried his best not to appear as shaken as he truly was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Y-yes, B-Black. . . y-yes, well, we all know he's bad news,&quot; Harry was staring at his Uncle, wanting to strangle him for saying something so malicious. Vernon knew he was walking on thin ice because he quickly changed the subject. &quot;But what I'm worried about are these bloody teenagers these days! When I was in school, if you put a toe out of line, they'd whack you! Make you cry like a baby, they would! But not these days, no, it's all about feelings these days. We don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. What this generation needs is a good whacking, eh Roger?&quot;<br>
<br>
Uncle Vernon was laughing and Roger was nodding, though he didn't answer yes or no to the question.<br>
<br>
And that's when he felt it again! He looked up in time to see Mrs. Banbury's eyes most definitely on him, but she looked quickly away upon seeing him notice it. She played with her food a little longer and then pushed her plate away, looking up and making a point of fixing her gaze directly into Harry's eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, Harry. How are you enjoying school?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Dursley's went deathly quiet. His Aunt and Uncle were shooting daggers at him with their menacing stares, warning him to watch his mouth. Harry gulped and made a point of not looking at Sophie whom he knew was probably terrified by him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, it's all right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you know, I actually have seen that place before. When I was young I had the most unfortunate experience of having to step inside.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my dear, Imelda! You poor thing!&quot; Mrs. Dursley was cooing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it was a long story. But I was just wondering, Harry. . .&quot; she took a breath, &quot;is Mr. Filch still keen on those horrific punishments?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry's fork dropped. What had she just said? Mr. Filch? Had she meant the Mr. Filch, Hogwarts' ground keeper? No, impossible. St. Brutus' must have had a Mr. Filch as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;And that cat of his! That Mrs. Norris-- she's not still alive, is she?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Dursley's were staring at him, awaiting his answer. Only problem was that Harry was paralyzed. This is no coincidence! She knows about Hogwarts! His pulse was racing as he kept her gaze. . . a glimmer shining in her eyes, her mouth twisted in a strange smile.<br>
<br>
He took a shaky breath and answered, &quot;. . . yes . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Mrs. Banbury's face was writhing with excitement. And then in the very next moment, she'd changed the subject and her and Aunt Petunia were back to discussing recipes, leaving Harry absolutely stunned.<br>
<br>
He didn't touch the rest of his dinner. When Petunia offered to clear away the dishes, Mrs. Banbury opposed fervently.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Harry will help, won't you Harry?&quot;<br>
<br>
He could see Dudley smiling out of his peripheral, but didn't care. He stood up shakily, picked up his dishes, and then went about collecting the rest, trying to keep his hands still. He followed Mrs. Banbury into the kitchen and, as he expected, she quickly closed the door behind them.<br>
<br>
Her smile was about ready to fly right off her face. &quot;I can't believe it. . . I never thought that . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you know?&quot; Harry blurted, &quot;How did you know about Mr. Filch and Mrs. Norris?&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood, admiring him for a moment before answering. &quot;Can you keep a secret?&quot;<br>
<br>
If only she knew. He nodded.<br>
<br>
She beamed, turned towards the sink where they'd set the dishes and to Harry's surprise, extracted a thin dark mahogany wand from underneath her belt. She pointed it at the sink and whispered &quot;Lavare Totalius!&quot;<br>
<br>
The dishes were at once sparkling and shining like new and Harry's mouth fell open. He stared at her in disbelief.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a witch!&quot; he whispered<br>
<br>
&quot;And you're Harry Potter! Oh, I just can't believe that I'm finally meeting you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But-how? I thought you were a muggle-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I am quite good at it, aren't I! It's one thing I'm a bit proud of, actually. That's one of the main reasons I think the Ministry placed me in Special Investigations, since I'm so good at blending in.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You work for the Ministry of Magic? Well then you must know Arthur Weasley!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Heavens, yes. I've known Arthur for years. Good man, Arthur.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;His son Ron is my best friend!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really? Well, how nice! I'll tell him that you said hello when I see him tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But- how - &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I feel it best to just tell people that I'm a housewife. That way they don't wonder when they don't see me leave the house since I apparate every morning.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And . . . Mr. Banbury. . . is he. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My stars, no! He's a muggle if there ever was one! Works for the police department. And before you ask, no, Sophie isn't a witch either. Strange thing, really. We thought for certain she would be- what with my family being an all-wizarding family-and I did so want her to go to Hogwarts. She really did as well. It was a tremendous blow to her when she never received her letter. She's a bit sour about having to go to a regular school the rest of her life, to be honest. But Roger and I are both very supportive of her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was delighted! His new neighbor, a witch! Not just any old witch, but one who worked for the Ministry of Magic and knew the Weasleys!<br>
<br>
At that moment Aunt Petunia stuck her head in the kitchen, flashing a smile that Harry knew was merely show. &quot;Need any help in here?&quot;<br>
<br>
Imelda winked at Harry and then turned around to face Petunia. &quot;Not at all, we've finished as you can see-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That certainly was fast,&quot; said Petunia, eyeing Harry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Harry here is an expert dish-washer. I suppose they certainly do train them well at St. Brutus'.&quot;<br>
<br>
Petunia nodded uncertainly and then turned and left.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mrs Banbury, I think I should warn you now, it's best the Dursley's know nothing about your being . . . about who you are. They're being kind to you now because they think that you're a respectable, normal family. But they hate everything to do with our world, believe me, and if they ever knew--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no intention of them knowing. I've worked in Special Investigations for eighteen years-I know a wizard hater when I see one. And I daresay, calling the Dursley's wizard-haters would be an understatement, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
The two of them laughed. Harry wished he could have spent the rest of the night talking to her, but instead he followed her back out into the living room, where Sophie sat looking bored out of her mind as Dudley rambled on and on about himself, and Roger sat trying to appear intrigued as Mr. and Mrs Dursley rambled on and on about themselves.<br>
<br>
The company filtered out finally, after several announcements by Roger of just how late it was getting, and several more comments of 'Too bad I have to be up early in the morning . . .' Harry said goodbye to the Banbury's and Imelda went so far as to quickly brush her fingers through his hair, catching a glimpse of his scar one more time. He followed the Dursley's back into number 4, not really noticing any of them at all. He was certain that his Aunt and Uncle were scolding him for something he'd done or said (the words 'useless, klutzy git' stuck out) but he paid it no mind and began his ascent upstairs in a daze.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you fancied Sophie, eh Harry?&quot; Dudley taunted after him as they walked down the hall, bringing him out of his trance. &quot;I saw the way you were looking at her. Forget it! She's mine, you hear me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry rolled her eyes-Sophie was actually the furthest thing from his mind at the moment. &quot;Yours, eh? Does she know that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dudley stuck out his foot and Harry tripped over it, flying face forward onto the floor. He grabbed Harry's collar, and pulled him up onto his feet, pushing him up against the wall. &quot;Think you're funny? I'm warning you, cousin. Let's see how tough you are without your silly little magic tricks to help you out, eh? Come on then, let's see how tough you are!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dudley was incensed and Harry's face fell when he realized that Dudley was seriously ready to fight him right there in the hall. His first thought was to make a dash for his wand, but that was under a slat in his bedroom--No magic, Harry. No magic. Then he thought he could perhaps talk his way out of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dudley, calm down, you're overreacting-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm overreacting? How am I overreacting when you're trying to steal mygirlfriend!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry made the terrible mistake of s******ing, &quot;You're girlfriend? You've only just met her!&quot;<br>
<br>
Wham. Harry bent over, his stomach throbbing with pain. Dudley had actually punched him square in the stomach! Harry, squinting in pain, looked at his cousin's smug, satisfied grin.<br>
<br>
And then, what happened next, even Harry didn't understand. He grimaced, eyebrows narrowed, his left hand nearly shaking from anger. He raised his left hand, which was tense and rigid and absolutely itching to return the favor to Dudley, and took hold of his collar. Dudley moved to get away, but Harry brought his other hand to his collar as well and held on tightly. And then-- he lifted Dudley--lifted him until his feet were dangling above the ground. It didn't even feel as though Harry were holding anything- though Dudley was closer to the weight of a rhinoceros, at that moment, in Harry's rage, he felt as light as a feather.<br>
<br>
Dudley's face was frozen with fear as his feet swayed, Harry's electric green eyes visible in the whites of Dudley's. &quot;Don't you dare hit me again,&quot; Harry managed to say, and then he slowly set him back down on the floor. Dudley, took a step backwards, still staring at Harry, and then made a mad dash for his room, slamming the door shut behind him.<br>
<br>
Harry walked, unsteadily, into his room, quite unsure of what had just happened. How had he been able to do that? He sat onto his bed and ran his fingers through his hair, mystified. It must have been the fact that he'd been so angry-years of taunting had finally put Harry over the edge. He had to smile, remembering the horrified look on Dudley's face.<br>
<br>
And then he remembered Imelda- next door at that very moment! Oh, how was he supposed to sleep after a night like this! He pulled out a roll of parchment and ink from under the floor and did what he always did whenever he had things he needed to get out: he wrote a letter to Sirius. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://otaku-universe.com/~jake/stevensig.png" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgamingarea87.showUserPublicProfile?gid=born2kill2>Born2Kill2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>'Stevan-O-Licous'

<br>
Dudley Dursley didn't so much as look at his cousin over the next week. Which was quite fine with Harry! And the fact that the Dursley's were so busy getting things together for their holiday meant even less interaction with them. They were going to be leaving one day before Harry's fifteenth birthday-and he could think of no better present.<br>
<br>
The morning of their departure, none of the Dursley's acknowledged him, put their luggage into their car silently-didn't even demand him to help out. It was only Uncle Vernon who came back into the living room for his coat that glared at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember what I told you. The Banbury's are going to be watching you. And you'd best believe me, if we come home and hear that anything funny has been going on, or see anything funny-you'll wish you'd never been born. I'll promise you that much!&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned, slammed the door shut behind him, and Harry watched through the curtains as their car drover angrily away, out of Privet Drive.<br>
<br>
Harry sat for a moment in silence. And then . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;Yaaaaa-hoooooooooo!&quot; Harry shouted and jumped up onto the sofa, like a little kid, bouncing up and down in glee. He let himself plop down on the sofa and laughed to himself-giddy with excitement. Without the Dursley's in the house, the place managed to even feel like home!<br>
<br>
He saw the television remote control and flipped it on, happily clicking through the channels when suddenly a figure appeared directly in front of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aahh!&quot; Harry screamed and threw the remote control out of this hands and covered his eyes.<br>
<br>
A voice was laughing in front of him and he peered between his fingers to see-<br>
<br>
&quot;Imelda!&quot;<br>
<br>
She wasn't dressed in her muggle clothes, but robes of deep burgundy. Her smile was glowing.<br>
<br>
&quot;All right, Harry? Living the good life already?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Y-yes! J-just watching a bit of telly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah yes. My personal favorite amongst muggle inventions. And I didn't meant to scare you, dear. I was just on my way to work when I remembered something: I meant to tell you earlier that Arthur says hello! And I'm most disappointed that I had to hear from him your birthday is tomorrow!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry smiled-it warmed him inside to know that Mr. Weasley remembered his birthday.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fifteen, is it? Well, what are you going to do about it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do about it? What do you mean--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well you are having a party, aren't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry blinked. &quot;A party? Me? Well, I've never actually . . . had one before.&quot;<br>
<br>
Imelda looked horrified. &quot;You'll be fifteen and you've never had a birthday party! Oh no, no, that won't do at all! We'll have to do something about that!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry shook his head, &quot;But the Dursely's-- can't have a party! What if something happens? They'll kill me&quot;<br>
<br>
Imelda snorted. &quot;I'd bloody like to see them try! No matter, no matter, you'll come by our house. Tomorrow evening-five o clock should do it, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry shrugged-he certainly had nothing else to do! She winked at him, an odd green mist surrounded her and when Harry blinked again, she'd disappeared.<br>
<br>
He had never, in his entire life, expected to have a birthday party. He'd only just started receiving gifts, so the idea of a party seemed unfathomable! And yet he spent the remaining of the day, and a good portion of the next, jumping with excitement. Not wanting to arrive empty handed, he decided to make something for the occasion, and went into the kitchen, snooping through Petunia's cupboards, looking for something he might be able to make.<br>
<br>
A cake perhaps? He hadn't a clue as to how to bake anything . . . he pulled out a recipe book of Petunia's and flipped through the cards. . . he did have a particular fondness of Chocolate cake.<br>
<br>
Three hours, an entire carton of eggs, and one gallon of milk later he had . . . something that somewhat resembled a cake . . . lopsided and misshapen, but a cake nonetheless. He grinned with pride as he smothered it with chocolate icing, happily ignoring the fact that doing so made it look all the more unappetizing.<br>
<br>
He cleaned up the kitchen, took a shower, tidied himself up to look as close to being presentable as he could, and walked across the lawn to number three Privet drive, Chocolate cake in hand, and rang the buzzer and precisely 5pm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Happy Birthday Harry!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;RON!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry nearly dropped the chocolate cake he was holding at the sight of Ron in the doorway.<br>
<br>
Ron pulled him inside and closed the door behind him, beaming boldly at his dear friend. Harry was sure it was a dream! Ron right in front of him!<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you doing here!&quot;<br>
<br>
He laughed, giving Harry a hug. &quot;My Dad! Told me that a witch moved in next door and that she was throwing a birthday party for you! She said that we had to come!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Ron laughed, pulling him into the living room. Harry's heart leapt.<br>
<br>
Beneath an enchanted banner hanging in midair reading H a p p y B i r t h d a y, H a r r y was the rest of the Weasleys: Fred, George and Ginny. Hermione was standing next to none other than Seamus Finnegan and Dean Thomas. Oliver Wood, Angelina Johnson and Katie Bell were all there as well, standing next to a pile of odd shaped presents. Harry was very close to having his knees give out from under him! He'd never been so completely surprised in his life!<br>
<br>
Imelda was loving his reaction and she walked up beside him giving him a hug, Roger and Sophie following her lead. Imelda gasped, &quot;Oh and you've baked a cake too! What a fine host you are! I do hope that we've rounded everyone up all right!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Ronald here--he took care of inviting everyone!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ron blushed as Harry smiled at him warmly. Hermione threw her arms around Harry first, soon joined by the rest of his Gryffindor friends.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hermione! Fred! George! Ginny!&quot;<br>
<br>
They all looked fantastic! Fred and George had always towered over Harry, but he was shocked to find that this time they didn't seem so very tall after all-- it appeared that he must have been catching up to them! Ginny looked older as well with her long red hair and pretty blue dress that seemed to match the very color of her eyes. That blush to her cheeks, however, it was still most definitely there. And Hermione! Once again, she was bronzed from the sun, dressed in muggle clothing of slick black trousers and a black crew tee.<br>
<br>
She pretended to scold him. &quot;I hope you know that I left from a holiday in Italy to come here for you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, don't worry. This is infinitely more fun already!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And Oliver! How did you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
Oliver Wood, who had just graduated from Hogwarts, shook Harry's hand. &quot;Fred and George, of course! I ran into them just yesterday at-&quot;<br>
<br>
Fred elbowed Oliver in the side and Oliver at once cleared his throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Er. . . I ran into them and they mentioned it to me, so here I am!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was keenly interested as to just where Oliver had met them, but was cut off by Imelda.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now wait a minute, that's one, two, three. . . seven . . . oh but we're missing someone aren't we?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are we?&quot; Roger asked, looking down at a guest list.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes! Where is--&quot;<br>
<br>
At that moment there was a large bang and a funny blue-ish green smoke came out of the fireplace. Roger didn't seem at all surprised by this, no doubt used to the wizarding ways, and went to the fireplace to greet the newcomer.<br>
<br>
Out stepped someone Harry hadn't seen for two years.<br>
<br>
&quot;Professor Lupin!&quot;<br>
<br>
Remus Lupin stood, dusting off his robes, grinning upon the sight of Harry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remus,&quot; said Imelda, shaking his hand. &quot;So glad you could make it!&quot;<br>
<br>
He nodded, shook hands with Roger and then went directly to Harry. Harry didn't wait for him-he threw his arms around him, hardly believing his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Professor! I can't believe you're here--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, tut tut, Harry. It's Remus, if you please. My teaching days have long been over.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a murmur amongst the guests, everyone just as surprised as Harry to see Remus Lupin again. After all, at one time he'd been their favorite Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm just so happy to see you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And you, Harry, and you! My, but you're growing up! Thought you were James when I stepped out of that fireplace.&quot; He bent down and whispered, &quot;Sirius wanted to come along-but he couldn't. I'm sort of his stand-in.&quot;<br>
<br>
Still in shock, Harry turned to Imelda. &quot;How--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't pretend that it was easy,&quot; she said jovially, &quot;do you have any idea how difficult it was for me to add my fireplace to the floo network? Mr. Fudge failed to mention that my house being next door to yours exempted my chimney from the floo network! It took a great deal of bribing to get it added by the end of the day!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't. . . oh Imelda, I--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, okay, okay, enough of this mushy nonsense,&quot; Imelda barked suddenly, clapping her hands together. &quot;Let's all eat!&quot;<br>
<br>
She clapped her hands together and suddenly the living room was covered with trays of chocolates, sweets, pastries, and other goodies. He was rather embarrassed by all the fuss and whenever anyone spoke with him, he made sure that the conversation was focused on them-talking about himself was something he was never good at, nor fond of.<br>
<br>
He was especially keen on getting to the bottom of what Fred and George had been up to and spoke with them the longest, trying to lure them into revealing their secret. But they knew what he was up to and remained tight-lipped on the matter.<br>
<br>
Remus, who'd been standing off in the back with Imelda and Roger most of the evening, kept staring at Harry for the majority of the evening. Finally, when there was a lull in Harry's conversation, Remus put his arm about Harry and walked him out into the Banbury's backyard.<br>
<br>
The two could hear the laughs and loud chatter from inside, even with the door closed behind them. The night was a temperate one, though there was very little moonlight. Despite himself, Harry was relieved of this- he didn't have to worry about Remus suddenly changing on him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've. . . heard all about it, Harry. About everything.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry's smile faded, immediately knowing what Remus was referring to. He put his hand on Harry's shoulder. &quot;Sirius came to my house in the middle of the night and I knew, by the look in his eye, that something had happened. But what he told me-even I couldn't believe at first. And all I could think of was you, Harry. Sirius was fiercely proud of you when he told me about it-and I am as well. I can't think of very many wizards my age even, who've had years of training against the dark arts, who could have done what you did. You've shown yourself to be a great wizard, Harry . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry didn't want to hear this. He shook his head, the vision of Cedric coming back to him. &quot;Right. Some great wizard I am. I couldn't even save Cedric. . .&quot; his voice broke off.<br>
<br>
Remus' eyes were intent on him. &quot;You know that wasn't your fault. You didn't know that was going to happen. And even if you did, there was nothing that you could have done- &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I could have tried. . . you didn't see what I did, Remus. Cedric lying there helpless. . . he was my friend. And I couldn't do anything to help him. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You've done more than you know, Harry! At first Sirius, Albus and myself all thought that Voldemort would start immediately on his quest. . . and for two months now we haven't heard a thing from him. The fact that you escaped from him must have shaken him-he's laying low. Of course, we can only guess as to what he's planning and we're working tirelessly to find out what it is before he does it. But the point is, you're alive-once again Voldemort's weaknesses have been exposed! He obviously isn't as all-powerful as he would like to believe. . . Sirius and I both agree that he's scared. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry cackled. &quot;Lord Voldemort is scared of a fifteen year old boy--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A fifteen year old boy who nearly saw to his destruction at the age of one, who thwarted his attempts at gaining power at the age of eleven, and who survived his Kerdava curse at age fourteen.&quot; Remus' lips were thin and solemn. &quot;He's angry, no doubt. But scared just the same.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry turned away, not wanting to listen to it anymore. He closed his eyes and shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;None of that matters to me, Remus. . . what I'm concerned with is. . . my friends. Cedric died because of me. It was my fault. And now with Voldemort back in power again . . . who knows what he could try to my other friends. . .&quot; his eyes were welling up with tears. &quot;Some great wizard I am, Remus. If I can't even save my friends. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But Harry--you can and you will! Not just your friends, but all decent wizard-kind! Don't you see? The fact that you're still here, sitting right next to me at this moment, is a sign of hope for all of us! Cedric's family, the Weasleys, Hermione, Sirius, Myself-all of us!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry didn't know what Remus wanted from him. What good was all of this talk?<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm still . . . scared, Remus.&quot;<br>
<br>
Remus embraced Harry and Harry held on as tightly as he could. &quot;Of course you are. But Harry, being afraid just means that you understand what's ahead of you. And courage doesn't mean that you're not afraid-it just means that you're ready to face it.&quot; He brushed Harry's hair out of his eyes and smiled warmly. &quot;Just remember that you have a weapon to your advantage that no one, not even Lord Voldemort can conquer-not even in death.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What's that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Friendship, Harry.&quot; He squeezed his hand on his shoulder. &quot;Everyone in that room, myself, your Godfather--your friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry hugged him again, needing those words more so than all the birthday parties or presents in the world.<br>
<br>
Fred and George had delighted Imelda and Roger, more specifically, all night with their endless truckload of stories from their days in Hogwarts. Roger was delighted with every spell and charm illegally cast-every practical joke and prank. (Which made Harry wonder just how good of a police officer he really was!)<br>
<br>
It seemed as though Sophie was delighted with Harry's friends as well-Dean Thomas in particular, whom she'd kept very close to throughout the evening. And ever since Dean had discovered that Sophie was a Fulham Football supporter, he'd been speaking to her of nothing else all night-not that Sophie minded, of course.<br>
<br>
Seamus and Neville were the first to leave, as Neville's grandmother had a strict curfew for him, and Oliver, Angelina and Katie followed them closely. Dean Thomas was next, along with Fred and George who took Ginny with them. Ron and Hermione were the last to leave, of course, the three of them going about setting up their next meeting.<br>
<br>
&quot;When will you be in Diagon Alley?&quot; Ron asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, that all depends on the Dursleys. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Imelda spoke up, &quot;I'll be glad to take you, Harry. It'll be fun! Besides, I know that Sophie would like to see what it looks like--&quot;<br>
<br>
Sophie's eyes lit up. &quot;Would I! Oh Mummy, really?&quot;<br>
<br>
Imelda smiled. &quot;Yes, yes, of course. Now, when do you leave for Hogwarts? The first?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When will you be there Mr. Weasley?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The twenty-eighth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Perfect! Then we'll be seeing you there and Miss Granger too, of course?&quot;<br>
<br>
Hermione nodded, &quot;Oh, of course! Oh and Mrs. Banbury, do see that Harry picks up some new clothes as well. Otherwise I'll have to think twice about wanting to be seen with you in public!&quot;<br>
<br>
Everyone laughed and Remus shuffled them off towards the fireplace. Three more puffs of green smoke and then everyone was gone.<br>
<br>
He couldn't stop showering the Banbury's with thank-yous. Imelda was quite opposed to his insisting that she was the kindest woman he'd met.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you don't stop complimenting me, young man, then I'm just going to have to revoke my invitation for you to have dinner with us tomorrow night.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But--you haven't invited me over for dinner tomorrow night.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh I haven't? Oh blast, well, I'd certainly meant to! And if you don't quit complimenting me, then I won't!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry tried not to laugh and merely nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good! Glad we have an understanding. How is six o clock?&quot;<br>
<br>
He laughed, &quot;Brilliant! I'll see you then!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry ended up eating with the Banbury's every night that week- one of the nights they even drove down into London! Harry was agog with excitement as he gazed out the back seat window, and Sophie kept laughing at the way he was ooohing and ahhing at everything they passed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You may laugh at me now,&quot; he warned, &quot;but I daresay you'll be acting the same way when you come to Diagon Alley!&quot; And then Harry got an evil glint in his eye, &quot;especially if Dean shows up, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
That landed him a smack in the arm from Sophie who fervently denied the accusation.<br>
<br>
&quot;You liar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well . . .&quot; she cracked a smile. &quot;Even if it is true, I see that I'm not the only one who has an admirer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your friend Ron--his little sister Ginny fancies you, doesn't she!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever gave you that idea-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh come on. You're going to tell me that you didn't notice the fact she was positively drooling at you all night long. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry could feel his ears burning.<br>
<br>
Sophie was staring at him, a strange twinkle in her enormous eyes. &quot;Mum says that you're quite the celebrity in the wizarding world. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
He was sure that he was going crimson. &quot;That is a matter of opinion.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, then it's the opinion of most everyone! Even me, and I'm normal--- erm . .&quot; she tripped over her words, &quot;I meant to say, er, that I'm a muggle. . .&quot; she cleared her throat. &quot;You know what I mean. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was smiling now.<br>
<br>
&quot; . . . but when I was a little girl, Mom used to read to me stories about the legendary wizards and witches-you know, Agrippa and all them-- and of course, she used to read me your story-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My story?&quot; Oh great. Don't tell me they're selling Harry Potter books nowadays . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it is in most every history book in your world, isn't it? Anyway, she used to tell it to me and it was always my favorite. . .&quot; she stole a glance at his scar. &quot;I mean . . . you have to admit, it is quite amazing . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
It must have been the five years of people staring relentlessly at his scar, talking constantly of you-know-who and all that, but Harry finally had had enough of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, not really,&quot; he said, quite sternly. &quot;I didn't do anything. If you're going to gawk over it, you might as well know who the true heroes are: Lily and James Potter-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your parents?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; He folded his arms, lowering his voice so that Imelda and Roger couldn't hear, though no doubt they were eavesdropping. &quot;Do you know why Voldemort couldn't kill me? It had nothing to with me, but my mother. See, he came to kill my father and myself. My mother refused to let him kill me and . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She sacrificed herself instead. . .&quot; Sophie finished, her voice cautious and tense.<br>
<br>
Harry nodded. &quot;It was a spell that she cast upon me. A simple one, an ancient one, and Voldemort hadn't suspected it and when he cast his death spell upon me, it instead flew back upon him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And it didn't kill him. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry shook his head. &quot;No. . . although he was very near death. Voldemort had spent his entire life trying to unlock the secret to becoming immortal. He did terrible things--he did anything in an effort to reach his goal, and after years of countless potions and spells to lengthen his life. . . I guess that's why the death spell didn't completely destroy him. . . and now . . . he's back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean 'he's back'?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He's rejuvenated himself. He's come to power once again-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sophie,&quot; Imelda spoke up from the front seat. She'd been listening to the entire conversation. &quot;Harry is exaggerating, dear. There is no proof that the Dark Lord has--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, but there is evidence! And I'm it!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Ministry of Magic would have been informed of the situation. To date, it is still just a rumor. Now Harry, I understand that the death of your friend Cedric was most unnerving and-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Imelda! It's the truth! I know it, Albus Dumbledore knows it--there are even people in the Ministry that know it's the truth!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cornelius Fudge has made no such statement or-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cornelius Fudge was there the day that Cedric died! He knows it's the truth! He's just too much of a coward and a power fiend to admit it! He knows that if he came before the Ministry with such a claim they'd boot him from office.&quot;<br>
<br>
Imelda had turned and was facing her from the passenger seat. &quot;Cornelius Fudge has taken a solemn oath that as Head Minister, his first and foremost obligation is protecting the lives of the wizarding community. If he knew this to be fact, as you claim it Harry, then he is bound by that oath to act on it. The fact that he hasn't proves that there is no such need. . . &quot; she paused and then added, as if obligated, &quot;at this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
By the time the Dursley's arrived home, he'd quite forgotten about they even lived there! He'd been in such a fantastic mood for such a long time, that nothing - not even the Dursleys - could snap him out of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;And how was your holiday,&quot; he asked pleasantly, taking Aunt Petunia's coat from her as they heaved their luggage in the door.<br>
<br>
Of course, she eyed him suspiciously. &quot;Why? What's happened? What have you done!&quot; Her eyes went frantically searching the house for something out of place. Harry even attempted kind words with Dudley, who merely grunted at him and trudged upstairs.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you, Uncle Vernon! Wasn't Majorca lovely?&quot;<br>
<br>
Uncle Vernon looked as though he would have loved to squash Harry into oblivion, but merely answered with &quot;None of your **** business, boy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry kept his smile and pranced upstairs, happily scratching a cooing Hedwig, and sat down to finish the remainder of his homework, unphased by the Dursley's return. What did they matter, after all?<br>
<br>
He had friends. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://otaku-universe.com/~jake/stevensig.png" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgamingarea87.showUserPublicProfile?gid=born2kill2>Born2Kill2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>'Stevan-O-Licous'

<br>
Imelda Banbury being the charmer she was (no pun intended!) had no problem in convincing the Dursley's that she merely wanted Harry to help her with taking care of some errands she'd been neglecting. Uncle Vernon was of course obliging to anything that had Harry doing some sort of physical labor, and he agreed heartily--even suggesting a number of things Harry could do around the Banbury's house. Painting the house, re-nailing the tile on the roof, de-weeding the garden-Imelda said she'd talk it over with her husband first.<br>
<br>
Sophie was nervous as the three of them approached the great brick wall that Harry knew well as the entrance to Diagon Alley. Imelda pressed the combination, the bricks moved aside and the three were able to step right into the heart of the Alley. Sophie clung to her mother's arm, who was beaming boldly.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's been much too long since I've been here,&quot; she admitted to Harry. &quot;I wonder if they still have-oh they do! Look-oh Sophie, Witchy Woman is the absolute best clothes shop around! You'll love it-oh, Harry, you don't mind, do you? I want to show Sophie their gorgeous hats.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Er--no,&quot; said Harry, really not wanting to spend hours perusing the aisles of Witchy Woman. &quot;Tell you what-I'll meet the two of you inside the Leaky Cauldron at three o' clock, all right? That should give me enough time to get what I need.&quot; Imelda and Sophie didn't need much convincing, and the three parted ways.<br>
<br>
Harry's first stop was Gringott's bank (the place still put him on his toes) and then straight to Chester's , the clothing store. He couldn't wait to find some decent clothes to wear and spent a good hour and a half, going through the many selections.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank Heavens,&quot; came the voice of Hermione Granger as Harry came out of the store, dressed in clothes that fit him perfectly. &quot;Glad you've decided against going to Hogwarts dressed as a circus clown.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ron Weasley was right beside her. &quot;A circus clown? What are those, eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry and Hermione exchanged amused looks. &quot;Never mind,&quot; she said, &quot;not important. Right then Harry, have you everything you need?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Only just started. Imelda and Sophie are here as well-off shopping somewhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sophie?&quot; Hermione asked. &quot;But she's a muggle, isn't she?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said as they walked towards Flourish and Blotts. &quot;But she's really keen on the wizarding world. Really wishes she was a witch actually. Poor thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ron grimaced. &quot;That's amazing. I mean, my Dad says that Imelda's family is one of the most prominent ones around. To have her daughter be a squib. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Hermione shook her head sadly. &quot;I'd be devastated!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's why Imelda's let her come to see Diagon Alley. She just loves being around it all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry had received his annual letter from Hogwarts that included his list of needed materials. He went through the list as they shopped, checking the items off as they shopped through the Flourish and Blotts bookstore. He stopped suddenly in an aisle, his eye catching a book entitled Kwikspell. It brought him back to two years ago when he'd discovered a letter in Hogwarts Caretaker Mr. Filch's office advertising that very book. Filch revealed himself to be a squib, and apparently these Kwikspell courses could teach even a squib new tricks. He immediately thought of Sophie-the longing in her eyes every time someone mentioned anything remotely related to magic.<br>
<br>
He shrugged--why not? What's the worse that could happen? It wouldn't work for her and she'd be right back to where she was. He picked it up and brought it to the register. Ron caught sight of it and laughed at him. &quot;What are you doing with that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not for me, it's for Sophie.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sophie?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah--who knows, right? It couldn't hurt.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry, Ron and Hermione met up with Imelda and Sophie at the Leaky Cauldron, Sophie ohhing and ahhing over the things that Hermione had bought. When asked what exactly the book 'Age of Intolerance-500 Years of Persecution' was about, Hermione wasted no time in going into a detailed history lesson about the injustices against witches and wizards over the centuries.<br>
<br>
They finished their lunch and Harry made arrangements to meet up with the two of them at exactly a quarter 'till eleven at Kings Cross Station the next morning.<br>
<br>
It was actually Sophie who volunteered taking Harry to the station-apparently getting a glimpse of her mother's world had really whet her appetite for more. Imelda of course didn't object and Harry was relieved that it meant he wouldn't have to worry about the Dursley's driving him into London.<br>
<br>
When Imelda told the Dursleys that evening that she would be more than happy to take Harry to the train station the next morning, they were immediately opposed.<br>
<br>
&quot;N-no, Imelda, r-really. Please don't bother--it's quite all right. Besides, we wouldn't want you exposed to the sort of . . . er . . . riff raff that will be there. You know he'll be with all his kind, right? No, no, it's out of the question.&quot;<br>
<br>
Aunt Petunia looked deathly worried-no doubt fearful of Imelda discovering Harry to be a wizard. The irony was too delicious to handle!<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, well, if that's the way you feel about it,&quot; said Imelda, sighing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes-it's best that we do it, Imelda dear. Thank you anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right, of course I understand-&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was confused-she was just going to let it drop? Just like that?<br>
<br>
He watched her as she turned her back towards the Dursely's, pulled her wand out from under her belt and whispered something that sounded an awful like 'Oblitus Dilutum' and then quickly turned to point her wand at the family. The three of them froze: Uncle Vernon's newspaper in mid turn, Aunt Petunia's mouth open ready to speak, Dudley's finger firmly placed up his nostril in mid-pick.<br>
<br>
&quot;Imelda, wha--&quot;<br>
<br>
She then murmured something else and a bright white light sparked from the end of her wand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Simply a memory charm, Harry, no need for alarm. Useful little trick-especially in my line of work. Never fails to get Muggles to give you what you need.&quot; She tucked her wand neatly away and said, &quot;Argutum Acuere!&quot;<br>
<br>
It was as though someone had pressed the &quot;play&quot; button on a remote control! The Dursley's immediately went back to exactly what they had been doing. Except this time, Aunt Petunia was saying, &quot;Why, that's wonderful of you, Imelda! Takes such a load off of my back. How fortunate that you just happen to be going into London tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Imelda, grinning, &quot;How fortunate indeed! Then it's all settled! I'll be by to pick up Harry at nine o' clock sharp.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He'll be ready,&quot; said Uncle Vernon, smiling overtop his newspaper. &quot;Won't you, Harry old boy?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Y-yes, Uncle Vernon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Imelda turned for the door and Harry rushed over to her. &quot;Let me walk you out, Mrs. Banbury.&quot;<br>
<br>
He followed her outside, hearing what sounded like his Uncle's voice say &quot;How thoughtful of Harry! Such a sweet boy, isn't he Petunia?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you do to them!&quot; He shrieked in disbelief, walking towards number three.<br>
<br>
<br>
Imelda laughed and opened the door. &quot;Oh, nothing. Come in, won't you? I've made biscuits, freshly baked. Don't you worry about your family. They'll be back to their usual terrible selves by the time you leave tomorrow. Just thought it might be nice to have at least one evening without having them on your case about something.&quot; She winked. &quot;Not supposed to do things like that, strictly speaking. But I won't tell if you won't.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Won't tell what?&quot; asked Sophie coming down the staircase, already dressed in her pink cotton pajamas. &quot;Oh! Er . . . hiya, Harry.&quot;<br>
<br>
He laughed. &quot;Bunny rabbits, Sophie?&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked down at her pink rabbit slippers and blushed furiously. &quot;Oh shut up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me bring out the biscuits and milk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Imelda disappeared into the kitchen and Sophie peered over the banister, then waved for Harry to follow her. &quot;Come here,&quot; she whispered, &quot;hurry.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry raised a brow and obeyed, following her up the staircase. She led him into what turned out to be her room and closed the door behind them. Harry felt incredibly awkward at first, and then realized: he'd never been inside a girl's bedroom before. Muggle or Wizard. And it was so . . . cute. Sophie seemed to be quite fond of pink as her bedspread was white with little pink daisies and even her walls had a very light pink hue to them.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's going on?&quot; Harry asked, trying hard not to appear as uncomfortable as he was.<br>
<br>
Sophie seemed completely oblivious to his awkwardness and pulled the kwikspell book from under her pillowcase. &quot;I just wanted to say thank you. You really don't know how much this means to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry shifted uncomfortably, &quot;Oh, that. No problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean, I've swiped spellbooks from Mom's room before, but. . . of course I couldn't do anything with them. Hopefully this book will be different. Look,&quot; she said proudly, pulling out something from under her bed. &quot;I even have a wand! It's old, though. Mom had it when she was my age and she just gave it to me-- just to amuse me, really.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was interested. &quot;Here, let me see? Maybe this wand isn't right for you-- after all, the wand chooses the wizard, not vice versa. And hand me that kwikspell book.&quot;<br>
<br>
She obeyed and Harry flipped through the pages. &quot;Hey, some of these are pretty good. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;well, they go from novice all the way to expert--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, so I've noticed! From engorgement charms to the confondus curse-- that's a hard one. And some of these I've never even heard of yet!&quot; He looked up to find Sophie peering past his shoulder to the pages. He wasn't used to this feeling-- why was he so ansy? He held out the book to her, &quot;Go on Sophie, show me one.&quot;<br>
<br>
She recoiled. &quot;No. I told you, I can't.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't act shy now, let's have a look.&quot;<br>
<br>
She took the book reluctantly and flipped through it, biting her lip.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right,&quot; she said, pacing about six steps and turning to face Harry. She held the wand and repeated &quot;transito regalitie,&quot; pointed the wand towards Harry.<br>
<br>
Nothing whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Harry liked feeling the part of the teacher and remembered what Professor Flitwick always said.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no,&quot; said Harry, taking his wand from his belt. &quot;this is the way it's done: it's called the 'swish and flick'-- watch carefully, okay? Try it like this:&quot; He swished and flicked and repeated what Sophie had said and a white light shot from the end of the want and exploded in front of her. She screamed and jumped back a few feet, stumbling to the floor. Harry's face went white: he stood and waited for a Hogwarts owl to swoop in on them, scolding him for doing magic-- it was against the law, after all!<br>
<br>
&quot;You all right,&quot; he cried, rushing to Sophie's side.<br>
<br>
She pulled herself up and nodded, &quot;Yeah-- yeah, I'm fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that incan--&quot;<br>
<br>
The door flew open and Imelda stepped inside, holding a tray of chocolate biscuits. &quot;What in Merlin's name is going on in here?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry gulped. How stupid could he get: Imelda worked for the Ministry of Magic! She could have him expelled for this!<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so sorry Imelda, I wasn't thinking! I was just showing her the right way to hold a wand and I guess I just, oh, I'm really sorry--&quot;<br>
<br>
Imelda smiled and placed the tray down on Sophie's nightstand. &quot;Relax,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Lucky for you we have a hiberitus charm here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A what?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A hiberitus charm-- magic goes undetected here. Very important as I am supposed to appear as a muggle-- quite effective too. Your Aunt Petunia would have caught on ages ago if it weren't for it-- I must say, she spends more time peering out the windows than she does anything else!&quot;<br>
<br>
He agreed and helped himself to two of the delicious biscuits. All three sat on Sophie's bed and talked, mostly Imelda as was her habit, until finally she told Harry it was probably time for him to be getting back-- Aunt Petunia was probably worried sick.<br>
<br>
He blushed as Imelda kissed him on his forehead as they reached the front door and he turned away back to number four.<br>
<br>
The next morning he could hardly believe his eyes. Thanks to Imelda's charm, Aunt Petunia had woken Harry from bed sweetly, calling 'Better get up, Dumpling! Don't want you to be late!&quot;<br>
<br>
He walked downstairs, unsure of what to make of the stack of blueberry pancakes, sausage and kippers that lay at his spot at the table. Uncle Vernon winked at him as he sat down. &quot;Better eat up, my boy! That's a mighty long train ride, isn't it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry, not wanting to move to quickly for fear he might ruin the spell, merely nodded. &quot;And do your Aunt and I a favor, would you? Please see to it you don't get into any trouble this year! It would break your Aunt's heart to get another Owl from your Professors. Promise us, will you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry, sure that he was still dreaming, answered, &quot;Y-yes. Of course.&quot;<br>
<br>
The doorbell rang.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah! That must be Imelda! So kind of her to do this!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dudley, finishing off his plate, jumped out of his seat. &quot;Don't worry, cousin! I'll go and get your suitcase from upstairs! You just finish your breakfast!&quot;<br>
<br>
Aunt Petunia rushed to the door and greeted Imelda and Sophie with a kiss on the cheek each and a hug. Imelda saw the look of shock on Harry's face and tried her best not to laugh. Sophie seemed quite delighted as well.<br>
<br>
Dudley heaved Harry's trunk down the stairs and eagerly handed Harry Hedwig's cage. &quot;All set, cousin!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry walked to the front door, stopped only by Uncle Vernon who put his hand on Harry's shoulder. &quot;You will stay the Christmas Holidays with us this year, won't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Petunia, &quot;Please Harry! You never stay with us!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry nodded. &quot;We'll . . . we'll see.&quot; Uncle Vernon gave Harry a suffocating hug and even said a goodbye to Hedwig, who'd surely expected him to take a swipe at her, not tickle her feathers.<br>
<br>
The Dursleys waved happily to Harry as he piled into the Banbury's car, Roger helping him with the trunk.<br>
<br>
&quot;That,&quot; said Harry, &quot;was the strangest thing I've ever seen.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You want to know something even better?&quot; Said Imelda, &quot;they're going to remember every last minute of it after it wears off! They'll be beside themselves with horror when they remember how they've acted.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Imelda,&quot; Roger scolded, &quot;really, dear, isn't that a bit childish?&quot;<br>
<br>
Imelda was laughing. &quot;Oh, nonsense Roger. They, of all people, could do with a little kindness.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kings Cross Station was duly crowded for a Monday morning. Roger pushed Harry's cart through the crowds. &quot;Where is it again?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Platform Nine and three quarters.&quot;<br>
<br>
Roger missed a step, &quot;Platform what?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Here!&quot; said Harry, stopping right in between the barrier between Platforms nine and ten. Roger looked incredibly confused, but shrugged, knowing better than to question wizarding logic.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harry!&quot; Hermione called, &quot;Finally! What took you so long!&quot; She came running up behind them, her parents pushing her cart. &quot;Ron and Ginny have already boarded-oh! Hello again Mr. and Mrs. Banbury! Hello, Sophie.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Hermione,&quot; said Sophie eagerly, delighted at seeing her again. &quot;All ready, then?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yes thank you--Harry come on, we'd best get going!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right, well . . .&quot; he turned to the Banbury's. &quot;Goodbye, Sophie.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Goodbye,&quot; she said quietly, giving him a hug-he felt so very sorry for her. &quot;Send us a letter, eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course.&quot; He turned to Imelda and Roger. &quot;And you two-I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for me. Really-you'll never know just how much it's all meant to me, these past few weeks. They've been the best I've had in years-actually, they're the best I've ever had.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey,&quot; said Hermione, slightly offended.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, what I meant was, the best weeks at Privet Drive I've ever had.&quot;<br>
<br>
Imelda laughed and embraced him, followed by Roger who gave him a firm handshake.<br>
<br>
&quot;And don't you worry about your cousin,&quot; said Roger. &quot;I've got an eye on him--don't trust him for a minute. Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could somehow get him sent to St. Brutus!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry laughed again and then, seeing Hermione impatiently tapping her foot, took hold of his cart and made a run between the barrier.<br>
<br>
The world around him immediately morphed and he was standing, once again, in front of the glinting scarlet Hogwarts Express. He heard Hermione appear behind him and followed her quickly.<br>
<br>
The stewards heaved their trunks onto the train, one of the men struggling with Herimone's in particular.<br>
<br>
&quot;What you have in here, luv?&quot;<br>
<br>
Hermione blushed. &quot;Well . . . perhaps I did pack one too many books.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Knowing you, Herm, you probably have all of Flourish and Blotts in that trunk.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was amazing to Harry that already this would be the fifth time he made the journey our of London for Hogwarts. It really did feel like yesterday that he saw the school for the first time and still, the sight of the castle rising majestically amongst the hills, left Harry momentarily speechless.<br>
<br>
It was an exceptionally warm evening when Harry and his fellow fifth years arrived at the entrance hall to be seated for the grand banquet. The enchanted ceiling above them was deep sackcloth black sprinkled with stars like salt and pepper and the room flickered with the dazzling warm orange and yellow light of hundreds of candles hanging in mid air upon nothing at all.<br>
<br>
Harry, Hermione and Ron took their usual spots together at the Gryffindor table, shouting hellos and their friends whom they hadn't seen all summer. The biggest news amongst the Gryffindors was that Dean Thomas had been named a Prefect. Hermione coveted that position, but remained congratulatory as Dean proudly showed of his Prefect badge.<br>
<br>
Colin Creevey, now a fourth year himself, had once again managed to slide himself in between Harry and Ron. Although he no longer hounded Harry with a camera and requests for his autograph, he still stuck to Harry like glue. Especially after what happened last term, Colin was by now thoroughly convinced that Harry was just as important a wizard as Albus Dumbledore himself. Harry had learned to simply ignore Colin whenever he dared say something so outrageous.<br>
<br>
Ron elbowed Harry. &quot;Hey, take a look at the Slytherin table.&quot;<br>
<br>
That 'S' word put an immediate scowl on Harry's face. He looked across the great hall to see the long row of black and green clad Slytherins, all of which held no smile as the rest of the hall did. They merely sat, stern faced, staring most threateningly at the Gryffindor table especially. Draco Malfoy sat directly in the middle, his arms folded, with his familiar smirk, eyes pointed at Harry, and Harry only. If it hadn't been for Lord Voldemort, Harry would have called Draco Malfoy his archenemy in a heartbeat. He most certainly ran a close second, to be sure.<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazing,&quot; Harry whispered to Ron. &quot;How can he even show his face here, knowing what his father is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius, was a supported of Lord Voldemort. Although the Ministry of Magic had cleared his name of charges and his family was actually respected by the Ministry, Harry had seen Lucius with his own eyes, bowing before Voldemort. He heard him call Voldemort his 'lord' and vowed he would never stray from him again. And here sat his own son, for crying out loud, at Hogwarts: a haven of safety, a place run by the very people who spent every fiber of their being trying to protect the people from the dark Lord.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm telling you,&quot; said Ron, his cheeks flushed at the very sight of him, &quot;if it wasn't going to land me in Azkaban, I'd like to put a crutacius curse or two on him-- wipe that smile right off his face.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry elbowed him to shut up, as at that very moment Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor house, swept pass them in her signature robes of tartan green, her black hair pinned up tightly beneath her hat. The first years followed her and assembled in front of the teacher's table-- they were ready for the sorting ceremony. A very long, but intriguing event.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait a minute!&quot; Cried Hermione in disbelief, &quot;Where's Snape?&quot;<br>
<br>
Indeed, Snape's usual position at the table was most definitely not filled by Snape! Instead, there sat a positively radiant woman with blond hair that cascaded down her back in long, thick, gently curled locks. Even from far away, Harry could see that she had enormous striking blue eyes-- a deep blue that matched the color of her robes.<br>
<br>
Both Ron and Harry's jaws dropped to the floor-- as did every other boys' in the entire great hall.<br>
<br>
&quot;She must be part Veela--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh really, Ron! Just because a woman is attractive, doesn't automatically make her a Veela!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Five sickles says she is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're on,&quot; Hermione said bitterly. &quot;Oh they can't have sacked Snape, can they?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who cares,&quot; Ron roared, &quot;look at this woman!&quot;<br>
<br>
The sorting ceremony commenced and Harry noted how odd it was that there were so few new additions to the Slytherin table! Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw received a generous amount of new students-- but only a few trickled over to Slytherin's side. After all the new students had taken their seats (the first year sitting directly across from Harry an especially frightened looking thing) Professor Dumbledore stood up and clapped his hands, addressing the first years with some general rules.<br>
<br>
&quot;And, as you have all most certainly noticed, our potions master Professor Snape is not with us today--&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a noticeable clamor of excited whispers.<br>
<br>
&quot;-- nor will he be with us for the rest of the first term. Professor Snape has been assigned a very important mission directly from the Ministry of Magic and he will not be rejoining us until after the Christmas holidays. Professor Warwick will be filling in until his return.&quot;<br>
<br>
The whispers grew louder. . . Harry even heard a few catcalls from some of the boys.<br>
<br>
Professor McGonagall peered over her glasses at this, and the hall grew quiet once more.<br>
<br>
&quot;And finally, I should like to direct everyone's attention to the back of the hall.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hundreds of pointed hats turned in that direction.<br>
<br>
&quot;you will notice the large blue fire hanging above the entrance door. That, my dear children, is an eternal flame that we have placed here in the great hall in honor of the memory of our own Cedric Diggory. It is interesting to note that similar flames have been put in place at both Durmstrang and Beauxbatons Schools for Witchcraft and Wizardry.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry stared-- the flames were beautiful: brilliant white and glowing blue, crackling ever so quietly. And the students applauded. Then the students roared and got to their feet, clapping still louder-- all the more louder. After an eternity, they finally sat back down and Dumbledore officially began the feast.<br>
<br>
The chatter at the Gryffindor table was, of course, about the most unexpected disappearance of Severus Snape. Now, any other time, Harry would have been rejoicing at the news of Snape's absence along with the rest of his Gryffindors. (Neville Longbottom looking especially relieved knowing he no longer had to fear walking into Potions class). Snape had succeeded in making a considerable amount of Harry's time at Hogwarts pure misery. He'd been picked on and bullied and slandered to a relentless extreme by Snape, and the two of them most definitely had what one would call a 'hate/hate' relationship.<br>
<br>
But not seeing Snape at the table worried Harry. Snape used to be one of Voldemort's loathed Death-Eaters, however he reformed years ago and renounced the Dark Ways. Harry had been suspicious of Snape at first, however after seeing Snape last term, he knew that Snape's loyalties were not with Voldemort, but with what was right. The Death Eaters had been called together by Voldemort, Snape of course did not join them, and Harry remembered specifically Voldemort saying that he would have to be killed. When Harry had escaped back to Hogwarts, Dumbledore had merely said to Snape 'You know what must be done.' Snape had agreed, said the he was ready, and left-- that was the last Harry had seen of him, and the fact that he was still gone was quite bothersome to Harry.<br>
<br>
Harry may have hated Snape with a burning passion, but as Dumbledore had said last term, they were all on the same side now-- and a house divided cannot stand.<br>
<br>
After the students had all pretty much gorged themselves on the feast, the prefect lead the tables out of the great hall and up the staircases to their dormitories. Harry smiled at the sound of first years passing, oohhing and the infinite staircase, and shrieking gleefully at the talking portraits. Gryffindor's new prefects were none other than Angelina Johnson and Dean Thomas-- a seventh and fifth year. (Hermione was most disappointed she hadn't been made a prefect. Harry had to remind her that although she was top of her year, her track record hadn't been entirely, shall one say, clean.) Dean lead them up to the entrance of the boys' dormitories and gave the password &quot;Brambleberry&quot; to the Fat Lady who smiled at them and let them enter.<br>
<br>
Harry threw himself onto his bed and sighed loudly. &quot;Ahhh. Good to be home, eh Ron?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're daft,&quot; Ron chuckled as he sat down on his adjacent bed-- their things had been brought up, as usual, by the castle's house elves, and the boys went about the business of changing for bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, where do you think Snape is?&quot; Harry asked.<br>
<br>
Ron wrinkled his nose. &quot;Who cares? As long as he doesn't come back! Get some sleep Harry.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Goodnight Ron,&quot; he said quietly-- although sleep was the last thing on his mind. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://otaku-universe.com/~jake/stevensig.png" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgamingarea87.showUserPublicProfile?gid=born2kill2>Born2Kill2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>'Stevan-O-Licous'

<br>
&quot;Go on then, let's have a look!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry, Hermione and Ron all compared their class schedules after Professor McGonagall handed them out over breakfast.<br>
<br>
&quot;****,&quot; Ron muttered, &quot;of course we'd have Potions with the Slytherins. Why can't they put us with the Ravenclaws. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, we have History of Magic with them, that's why,&quot; Hermione answered promptly.<br>
<br>
Ron rolled his eyes. &quot;It was a rhetorical question, Herm.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, and look! Our new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor is someone named . . .&quot; she held the paper closely to her face, &quot;Professor Simon Gray.&quot; She blinked. &quot;He wasn't at the fest last night, was he?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. . .&quot; Ron shook his head as he shoved a spoonful of oatmeal into his mouth. &quot;Too bad it's not another witch! I could get used to this!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hermione made another groan of disgust, and they quickly finished their breakfast before making a break for their first class of the day-- which just so happened to be potions.<br>
<br>
They joined the Slytherins in the familiar dungeon, neither house so much as making eye contact with the other. Usually the complete cold shoulder came when the battle for the House Cup was at its highest, but here on the first day of classes, the two houses had already reached that breaking point.<br>
<br>
Draco Malfoy, sitting in between his two oaf-like friends Crabbe and Goyle, was the only one giving the Gryffindors any type of attention. And it was that same, curious, twisted smile-- the smile that Harry had wanted to slap off his face for four long years.<br>
<br>
Professor Warwick entered the room at that time and immediately, every boy in the chamber snapped to attention, sitting perfectly straight. She walked-- no-- she flowed to the front of the classroom, her robes billowing behind her with the same airiness as her platinum hair. She turned to face the students and folded her arms, absolutely silent, staring down each and every one of them.<br>
<br>
It was an uneasy silence and it seemed like it was going to last forever.<br>
<br>
And then, she finally opened her mouth to speak. &quot;Before any of you ask-- no. I am not part Veela.&quot;<br>
<br>
She flashed a winning smile as the boys laughed happily at her joke. Hermione spun around to face Ron and mouthed triumphantly, 'five sickles!'<br>
<br>
&quot;I am, however, your Potions master for the time being and shall try my best to be every bit as efficient as your dear Professor Snape.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ron coughed loudly, gaining a s****** from several other Gryffindors.<br>
<br>
Professor Warwick raised a brow. &quot;Perhaps we should first learn a potion to cure nasty coughs, should we Mr. . .&quot; she glanced down at her roll sheet, &quot;Mr. Ronald Weasley, is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Slytherins liked this, and let out a series of muffled laughs.<br>
<br>
Professor Warwick turned to them immediately, her eyes wide. &quot;And after that, we'll brew a remedy for those wretched giggles. You'd like that wouldn't you, er . . .&quot; her eyes flickered down to her roll sheet. &quot;Mr. Draco Malfoy, correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
Draco stared at her. She smiled once again. &quot;Malfoy? You aren't Lucius' son, are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Draco stiffened.<br>
<br>
&quot;I went to Hogwarts with him. Let him know that Ariah says hello, will you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Shutting up Draco Malfoy was all that was needed to gain the approval of any Gryffindor, even at the expense of one of their own.<br>
<br>
Professor Warwick was a pleasant tempered witch, but anyone thinking they could take advantage of her disposition soon found out that she had absolutely no problem with handing out both scathing sermons and detention notices.<br>
<br>
Hermione thought she was absolutely brilliant.<br>
<br>
After lunch, the three trudged up the staircase to their Defense Against the Dark Arts class with the Ravenclaws and took their seats. Hermione was going about the business of arranging her parchment and ink so as not to miss a beat of the professor said.<br>
<br>
Now, Harry was a bit nervous about just who his new Dark Arts Professor would be. In the four years he'd attended Hogwarts, only one of them turned out to be someone he could trust-and even he turned out to be a werewolf! There was Professor Quirrel in his first year, whom Harry discovered to be nurturing Voldemort back to power. There was Gilderoy Lockhart in his second year --- enough said right there. His third year he had Professor Remus Lupin who was a fantastic teacher and was nearly able to capture Lord Voldemort's servant Peter Pettigrew--but Snape, who'd loathed Remus since adolescence, saw to it that the school board found out about Remus being a werewolf and he of course resigned. And then, last year, there was 'Mad-Eye Moody'--who really wasn't Moody at all! A Death Eater named Barty Crouch had been taking a potion to appear to be the Professor so that he could help set up a plan that would both bring Voldemort back to power and bring Harry back to Voldemort--a plan that he succeeded in.<br>
<br>
So needless to say, Harry was on pins and needles as the classroom waited for their new Professor to arrive. Given his past history, Harry wouldn't have been surprised if the new Professor was Lord Voldemort himself!<br>
<br>
Harry shuddered at the very idea just as the door to the chamber flew open.<br>
<br>
A tall and slender man, dressed most elegantly in rich, gorgeous black robes strode past them to the front of the class. His brown hair was cut rather short and neat-every hair in its proper place. He wore large silver spectacles, that were perhaps a bit too large for his face, for they magnified his eyes much the way Professor Trelawney's did hers. A thin pencil line of a moustache was the finishing touch on this striking face. . .<br>
<br>
And Harry, staring at him from his seat up in the front, had the gnawing feeling that he knew him from somewhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good morning class!&quot; Came a voice, considerably higher than Harry would have imagined from such a tall man.<br>
<br>
He looked visibly nervous and fumbled with some papers he'd placed on his desk.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Professor Gray and I should like to welcome all of you to your fifth year! You made it!&quot; He swallowed and then continued, trying very hard to sound as composed and collected as possible. &quot;I attended Hogwarts as well, of course. A Gryffindor, actually.&quot;<br>
<br>
Happy murmurs came from the Gryffindors.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I must tell you, that out of all seven years, my fifth year was my favorite. And I think it was actually mostly due to this class! There's so much to learn this year-and several, erm, surprises along the way.&quot; He cleared his throat. &quot;A--and I also have been educated on the rumors that many here feel this position to be. . . cursed?&quot;<br>
<br>
More murmurs from the students.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I must admit, the past several years doesn't give one much confidence. But. . . I'm willing to take my chances.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was staring Professor Gray intensely. . . yes, there was most definitely something about him that seemed familiar to him. Oh, well, perhaps it had just been in casual passing. . .<br>
<br>
Professor Gray opened his textbooks, &quot;Class, if you please, open to the index-right there on the first page, yes. There are thirty four chapters in this book-all of which are very important of course, even though to be quite honest, well, most of you are never really going to come across the Gauraneese Mauler Bat that Chapter Twenty-Six focuses on unless you find yourself alone in a dark cave in the middle of night in the Gaura Valley in Transylvania-and if you ever are, well, of course it would be your own silly fault in the first place for even being there.&quot;<br>
<br>
The class laughed in agreement.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, we have more important things to deal with than fierce creatures whom none of us will ever really come across. Much more. . . pertinent things to deal with. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Everyone leaned forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me ask a personal question and, please, anyone feel free to answer. When you think of the Dark Arts, what is it that scares you the most?&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh come now, over the past four years you've learned much about the arts. What is it that frightens you the most?&quot;<br>
<br>
A memory suddenly whipped into Harry's mind of Voldemort's red eyes, that high-pitched laugh, his cold and bony finger upon his cheek. . .<br>
<br>
To everyone's surprise, it wasn't Hermione that raised her hand first.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes- er. . . Mr. Longbottom, correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
Everyone turned to face Neville. His face was ghostly pale. &quot;Well. . . death.&quot;<br>
<br>
Professor Gray's expression didn't change. &quot;Death,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Unfortunately, Mr. Longbottom is quite correct in his fear. Dark Wizards differ from yourselves and myself in many ways-the most obvious of which is their utter disregard for life both wizard and muggle. Killing is their most common weapon, this is true. But someone else answer me this: does this mean that you should spend your lives locked up in a dungeon, scared to step outside?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry felt himself raising his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Mr. Potter--it is Mr. Potter, isn't it?&quot; Harry nodded. &quot;Well. . . no, it shouldn't.&quot; He remembered what Remus had said only two weeks ago. &quot;Because being afraid just means that you understand what's ahead of you. And courage doesn't mean that you're not afraid, it just means that you're ready to face it.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a terrific smile that flashed across Professor Gray's face, and then he quickly brushed it off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Precisely, Mr. Potter. I know that . . . given recent events. . .there is a lot of fear gripping the magical community. But this, in a nutshell, is why we're here in this class. So that we can understand what may be ahead of us and therefore be able to face it and deal with it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Professor Gray was most definitely passionate about his subject and spoke every word as though it sincerely meant the students' very lives. &quot;So, forgive me for I'll be skipping several of these chapters--oh yes, we'll cover them--but I just want this year to be focused on the more important things.&quot;<br>
<br>
The class dismissed not too long afterwards, everyone leaving in a sort of daze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Ron breathed, &quot;I, for one, am now completely depressed. Made it sound like the end of the world was coming.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He did not, Ron,&quot; Hermione protested. &quot;He was really, rather brilliant. Don't you think so Harry?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry was in a sullen mood after the class, but would have hardly called it depressing. &quot;It was sobering, that's for sure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;Professor Gray is wonderful-I think we're going to learn an awful lot with him this year.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Herm, you just fancy him, that's all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What ever would give you that idea!&quot; There was a flush to her cheeks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because that is exactly what I said about Professor Warwick after we left her class.&quot;<br>
<br>
**<br>
<br>
Hermione had been devastated over her not being selected as a prefect. It wasn't the exact feeling, but a bit similar to how Harry had felt about not being named the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Oliver Wood had graduated last year, which meant that a new Captain had to be appointed. Now, Harry wasn't the sort of person to pat himself on the back, but if there was one thing he was certainly proud of, it was the fact that he was a **** good Quidditch player. He was of course, happy for their new captain Angelina Johnson, but disappointed nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Angelina, as it turned out, was just as uncomfortable over the assignment. The first morning of practice, the week after school began, she told Harry so, privately.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know that I really think it should have been you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Angelina, you're the best Chaser that we--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And you're the best Seeker in the entire school! It really should have been-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Look, what's done is done. You're going to be great as Captain! I know it!&quot;<br>
<br>
Angelina opened her mouth to protest again, but Harry would have none of it. &quot;Come on. We're a team. And, most importantly . . .&quot; he paused, smiling at Angelina. &quot;We're going to beat Slytherin again!&quot;<br>
<br>
Angelina laughed, and the two walked off on the playing field. Fred, George and Katie Bell were waiting for them, shouted the Gryffindor cheer and then sped off up into the air.<br>
<br>
Harry's Firebolt hadn't missed a beat -- three months away from it, and it was still just as deft and skillful as ever. Now, Harry thought as he rose and dove through the air. Now I'm really home.<br>
<br>
Harry walked towards the great hall, more than ready for lunch, his heart still racing from his ride on his Firebolt.<br>
<br>
Two arms grabbed hold of him and pulled him back behind a pillar-- Ron and Hermione both were wide eyed.<br>
<br>
&quot;We,&quot; said Hermione, &quot;have a problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry's stomach churned. &quot;Exactly what do you mean by 'problem'?<br>
<br>
Ron grimaced. &quot;As in something that could get us all expelled if we don't fix it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry's jaw dropped. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ron stared at Hermione, looking as though he was ready to burst from anger. Hermione took a breath,<br>
<br>
&quot;Right. This morning before breakfast I was getting dressed and I went to pull my shoes out from my closet when I heard something. Something hidden in amongst my clothes. So I looked through all my clothes and . . . and . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;SOPHIE!&quot; Ron blurted, coming unglued, &quot;SOPHIE BANBURY was hiding in her closet!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry gulped. &quot;Impossible...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Apparently not!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hermione looked frantic. &quot;So I pulled her out and demanded an explanation. She was just standing there clutching her jumper for dear life, terrified, stammering--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What did she say!&quot; Harry roared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Said she was sorry-- oh so sorry. Said that she couldn't help herself-- that Harry and her mother and I were yakking away at the gate and the urge just overcame her-- she opened up my trunk and slipped right in--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT&quot; Harry cried-- he could hardly believe his ears! &quot;Oh my-- if Dumbledore-- no, if McGonagall knew about this-- oh Hermione!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't do anything! Sophie did!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Still, you do look like a Muggle Smuggler, Herm.&quot; There was more amusement in Ron's voice than anger when he said this-- and Hermione was not very pleased.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh just shut up! The both of you! You've got to help me get her out of here!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How can we possibly get a muggle out of Hogwarts when it's hard enough as it is to even get one in!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry groaned. &quot;Okay-- where is she now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, she's in my closet of course! She's got to keep hidden. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Ron and I will come right up and talk to her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Great,&quot; Ron muttered. &quot;The bloody girls' dormitory. I can see it already: McGonagall catches us in the girls dormitory with a muggle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, but we won't get caught!&quot; Harry smiled at Hermione. &quot;It's okay, Herm. We'll figure this out. Ron? Let's go and get my cloak-- Herm, you wait for us at the door to your dorms.&quot;<br>
<br>
All three turned and made a dash for Gryffindor.<br>
<br>
&quot;But -- what -- about -- lunch,&quot; Ron panted as they blitzed up the staircase.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have to act now, while everyone is out of their rooms.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry yelled the password &quot;magnus sungam&quot; at the Fat Lady. He threw open his trunk, pulled out his fathers' invisibility cloak and pulled it over himself and Ron, then made a break for the girls' dorms.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't bloody believe this,&quot; Ron was saying as they ran. &quot;What the hell was she thinking!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Obviously she wasn't thinking.&quot; Harry was still in disbelief. &quot;I mean. . . she's a muggle! What could she possibly have thought--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep it down!&quot; Hermione scolded. She was standing at the door, waiting, and pulled it open. &quot;I could hear you all the way upstairs!&quot;<br>
<br>
Still hidden beneath the cloak, they followed Hermione towards her dorm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey,&quot; Ron said, &quot;it looks just like ours!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well of course it does! What did you think it looked like?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I dunno-- more. . . . girly. Lots of pink and daisies and all that--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really, Ron.&quot; Hermione knocked on the closet door. &quot;Sophie? You all right?&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a squeak in reply and Hermione pulled open the doors.<br>
<br>
Sophie looked a wreck: her hair was sticking up in all places, much the way Harry's did, her clothes wrinkled, her eyes red with fatigue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on out, Sophie,&quot; Hermione coaxed. She did so, very cautiously.<br>
<br>
Ron threw the cloak off him and lay right into Sophie. She yelped, most likely never having seen an invisibility cloak, and took a step back as Ron shouted at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you flipping mental? What were you bloody thinking? Do you know how much trouble we could get into for this? Do you know how much trouble Hogwarts could get into with this? My Dad works for the Ministry of Magic, and if they find out that Hogwarts has allowed a Muggle onto the property, who knows what they'll do!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sophie had tears in her eyes. Harry's heart softened and, still clutching the cloak close around him, he stepped forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sophie, calm down. It'll be all right.&quot;<br>
<br>
She yelped again, her eyes still wide in horror. Harry remembered what he must have looked like to a muggle-- his body half invisible.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh.&quot; He threw the cloak off and Sophie relaxed. &quot;It's just . . . you can understand why we're upset, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;And your parents, Sophie,&quot; he continued. &quot;Roger and Imelda must be beside themselves. Why did you do it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;B-because I. . . I. . .&quot; the tears came again. &quot;I wanted to be like you! All of you! I spent my whole life wanting to go to Hogwarts, and be as great a witch as my Mum was. I know. . . I know I'm a disappointment to her . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry had to smile. &quot;That's ridiculous and you know it. You're not a disappointment-- your parents love you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hermione nodded. &quot;Exactly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But I'm a--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your Dad is a muggle as well and I'm sure that he doesn't think it's so very terrible. My parents don't!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your parents are both muggles?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes!&quot; Said Hermione brightly.<br>
<br>
Sophie burst into tears. &quot;You mean to say that you're a witch and both your parents are muggles, while I'm --&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh this is just silly,&quot; Ron snapped. &quot;Listen Sophie, I'm sorry that you're unhappy. I really am. But you can't stay here! We're going to have to get you home.&quot; He took a breath. &quot;You lot? We're gonna have to tell Dumbledore.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; Sophie shrieked, &quot;Please let me stay! Don't tell Mr. Dumbledore! Oh, my mother would be in such trouble!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As much as we'd like for you to stay,&quot; said Harry, &quot;we can't. If we did, all of us: you me, Ron and Hermione, would all be out of school.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not fair to any of us,&quot; added Hermione.<br>
<br>
Sophie was bawling. . . but she understood. After a moment she was reduced to shrivels every now and then.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right. Of course you're right. I'm . . . sorry. I didn't want to put anyone in danger, and certainly I didn't want to risk your being expelled. I just lost my head. I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, thank heavens for that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry whipped around to see none other than Professor McGonagall in the dormitory, her arms folded, leering over her glasses.<br>
<br>
Everyone gulped.<br>
<br>
McGonagall eyed each one of them and then said, &quot;This way, please.&quot;<br>
<br>
The four walked out of the girls' dormitory in silence, Sophie looking particularly terrified. Harry's heart went out to her: if McGonagall could scare him out of his wits, how much more so to a muggle!<br>
<br>
She led them wordlessly, up a winding staircase-- wonder evident in Sophie's face as they passed the portraits. (One bade her 'good day' which made her collide into Ron). Albus Dumbledore's office was a place that Harry and Ron had seen much more of than any other student at the school Dumbledore was sitting at his desk, writing away, and he looked up and upon seeing them, gained that familiar twinkle in his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;My, my, Minerva! This sets a record I believe for Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley! The second day of school! It's usually a week before I see you-- and this is with Severus gone!&quot; He chuckled happily as he stood up.<br>
<br>
Sophie, who stood next to Harry, subconsciously grabbed Harry's arm when she got a good look at Albus. Harry had to admit that to a muggle, seeing Dumbledore with his long, brilliant white hair and beard, and his purple robes-- it would be a bit intimidating.<br>
<br>
&quot;And this must be our little stow-away,&quot; he said pleasantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you know?&quot; Harry breathed-- and then quickly realized what a stupid question that was. Albus patted the head of a barn owl that looked somewhat familiar. It was Mrs. Banbury's owl, to be sure. Albus picked up a letter, cleared his throat and read:<br>
<br>
To Albus Dumbledore<br>
Hogwarts Headmaster<br>
<br>
Dear Sir:<br>
I am writing to you in a state of panic. Sophie, my only daughter and a muggle has disappeared and I have good reason to believe that she is at this very moment on your campus . This at least gives me some peace of mind, knowing she is of course safe in your institution. Please write to me the minute you receive this owl and let me know if Sophie is indeed there and when I may come to take her home.<br>
<br>
Yours most sincerely,<br>
Imelda Banbury,<br>
Ministry of Magic - Special Investigations.<br>
<br>
Sophie kept her gaze at the floor, not able to make eye contact with anyone.<br>
<br>
&quot;However. . . this has put us in a most awkward position.&quot; Professor Dumbledore took his seat once more, folded his hands, and peered overtop his spectacles. &quot;I take it that Miss Banbury hid herself in one of our Hogwarts school trunks, am I correct?&quot; &quot;Yes. Mine,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;That is a very lengthy train ride to be cooped up inside a trunk. Ten hours, I believe the train ride is. Especially tedious is it inside a Hogwarts trunks which, incidentally, are all air-tight. &quot; Harry's heart skipped a beat. What had Dumbledore just said?<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right, Miss Banbury. Those trunks are all specifically designed to be completely air-tight. There is no possible way that any non-magical living being could survive more than twenty minutes inside one of them. And you survived ten hours.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sophie had lifter her gaze up to meet Dumbledore- the shadows of smile beginning to appear.<br>
<br>
&quot;This being the case only leaves one conclusion to draw: that Miss Banbury does possess some degree of magical potential.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So she's not a squib then?&quot; asked Ron.<br>
<br>
Professor Dumbledore laughed softly. &quot;She never was a squib to begin with, Mr. Weasley. You see, a squib is someone who comes from an all wizarding family, and yet has no magical powers. A muggle is classified as someone who has at least *one* parent who is a muggle, and has no magical powers. Sophie's father is a muggle, therefore her lack of magical powers classified her as a 'muggle' as well. When you look at it that way, it's just a simple matter of genetics. However, in Miss Banbury's case, she is neither a muggle nor a squib.&quot; Dumbledore's eyes twinkled as he smiled at her. &quot;No, she is a witch.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Although a very, very late-bloomer, I should add!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sophie was positively beaming! Harry, Ron and Hermione were smiling as well, delighted with the news!<br>
<br>
Dumbledore continued. &quot;Now, it being the case that Miss Banbury is now too old to be admitted as a student here, with her blessing, I should like to send back home where she will participate in a correspondence class. I am certain that your mother will be delighted to tutor you, as will Mr. Potter here, whenever he is home.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry knew that he was being volunteered, but knew better than to ever appear ungrateful for anything Dumbledore said or provided. He merely kept quiet. &quot;Good,&quot; said Dumbledore. &quot;I shall write your mother immediately, and if all goes according to plan, you will be on your way home by tomorrow morning.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sophie broke out into a smile, her eyes still red from all her tears. She nearly choked out her words, too overcome with emotion. &quot;Sir, I cannot thank you enough . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Dumbledore pat her on her head, &quot;then best not try to, eh?&quot; he turned to Professor McGonagall, &quot;Minerva, I trust you'll see to Miss Banbury's sleeping arrangements for tonight?&quot;<br>
<br>
McGonagall nodded. &quot;I was thinking perhaps the fifth floor--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Dumbledore, &quot;Wonderful idea, Minerva!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She can't stay with us in the girls dormitory-- just for tonight?&quot; Hermione almost looked mournful.<br>
<br>
&quot;No room, Miss Granger. And. . . well, it's best we put her up in her own chamber. And now Sophie, your friends will be needing to return to their classes. . .&quot; Dumbledore stood up and walked slowly towards the door, Harry and the rest walking with him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Professor Dumbledore,&quot; said Hermione, &quot;won't we be seeing her before she leaves?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Most unlikely, Miss Granger. Mrs. Banbury will probably arrive for her just as you're in the middle of your defense against the dark arts class. . . which reminds me. . . Potter, may I have a word? Minerva, please take Miss Banbury to her quarters directly and see that she's comfortable, Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger, I expect Hagrid is wondering where you are right about now.&quot;<br>
<br>
They bade their farewells to Sophie, Hermione looking upon her with an especially maternal glint in her eye (Harry reckoned that Hermione now viewed Sophie as a disciple of hers). Sophie followed Professor McGonagall, looking back behind her with a weak smile, visibly nervous about being alone with the imposing Professor McGonagall, and Hermione and Ron filed past Harry, looking every bit as curious as Harry felt.<br>
<br>
Dumbledore closed the door once everyone had left and Harry looked up anxiously.<br>
<br>
What have I done this time? Dumbledore was beaming at him from overtop his lunar spectacles. &quot;So you think you'll enjoy your classes this year, do you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry nodded cautiously. &quot;I hope so, Sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your new potions master is only temporary. You see, I've placed Snape on an. . . assignment for me. Just in case you were worried as to his whereabouts-- I realize that last you saw him he left quite abruptly. But hopefully he won't be too much longer--&quot;<br>
<br>
Harry did all he could to keep from yelling 'tell him there's no hurry. . .'<br>
<br>
&quot;--And your defense against the dark arts professor. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; Harry piped up immediately. &quot;We all think he's brilliant!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dumbledore nodded. &quot;Indeed. Quite . . .&quot; he placed a hand on Harry's shoulder. &quot;You know. . . it's a funny thing about him. I could just swear that he reminds me of someone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes! That's exactly what I thought too!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dumbledore was nodding, thoughtfully. &quot;Yes. . . actually, I rather think that he looks as though he could be related to your Godfather, Harry.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sirius?&quot; Harry repeated blankly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Sirius. The same face , you know? As a matter of fact. . . if I didn't know any better, I'd say that it is Sirius. But that's if I didn't know any better.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But you do know better, right Sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dumbledore said nothing. His smile, however, broadened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right, Sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
He kept his smile. &quot;It's getting late, Harry. I've kept you from class long enough.&quot; <p>Dear Who Ever Reads This,<br>
