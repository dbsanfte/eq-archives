That box is the reason I was pulled from battle.  I had been given explicit instructions to come directly here to guard the object I was to find here.  And that's it.  ..And even if that doesn't convince you.....these monks...GAVE THEIR LIVES... Suttox and his brethren valued whatever it is in this room enough to face utter destruction in order to save this.... So let me ASSURE you that this box is NOT a cheap toy.&quot;<br>
The unusually red-tinted human cleric struggles again to get out of his stricken position on the floor.  He decides that it's not worth it at this time, and is content with the cool stone.  He rolls onto his back so as to better address his interrogator.<br>
&quot; 'What are these things' you ask? I am not able to completely fulfill your question, but i do know that they appeared out of nowhere. Literally..OUT OF NOWHERE. One minute the monestary is a place of quiet contemplation, a place of safety, and...the next...its infested with beings the likes of which I have never seen.  I...they...it was horrible. Claws..and gaping mouths.  And..and burning red eyes.  But it wasn't the eyes that bothered me. It was the darkness behind them.  The empty void of darkness that lit their demonic faces.  I am certain that they are abominations...nothing like those...things..could be created through the power and the grace of Obad-Hai.......nothing....and they destroyed it. They destroyed all of them....I swear by the quarterstaff of Obad-Hai that I will find these monsters and exact due revenge....oh Suttox......&quot;<br>
The emotionaly drainedl human rolls back onto his stomach and exhales.  It's obvious that he is struggling to deal with so much death in such a short time.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sovbeos>sovbeos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monk Man Monster-killa</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(2/19/03 7:40:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/sovbeos/stance.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Comfort</span><hr size=1> Serin quickly moves over to Toric to provide him some support, and a friendly hand he can touch.<br>

Although initially intending to simply thank him for his compassion and understanding, the cleric finds himself staring deeply into the yellow eyes of his benefactor.  It's as if he's drawn there.  And with one quick glance, he realizes that he's found someone who could very well understand the turmoil burning inside of his heart.  Toric soon realizes what he is doing and quickly blinks his eyes so as to clear the fog that had settled through his long ordeal, and separates his gaze in order to focus on the question.  &quot;Any other information?? Yes, I think I might...although, I must say before I go on, that I was trapped in here from near the beginning, so my experience might not help you as much as you might like.  Anyway, you already know about the battle, and my task to guard this room.  Now let..me..seee...The battle had lasted only a few minutes..or maybe it was hours, i can't remember..when that invisible wall you found me locked behind appeared.  It don't know what its purpose was, but I think it might have been some sort of protective measure for the box, but I was unaware of this.  I was standing back there :<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> oints toward pedestal:: when it happened.  If it really was meant as protection, it was definitely triggered as a means of a last resort.  By that time, the battle would have been a lost cause.  However, the sound of combat still raged on, even with me trapped.  However, at some point, I began to hear a strangely eerie, soothing melody.  It seemed almost like a lament, or a farewell melody exchanged between lovers.  It was very enchanting.  Then I heard the grating of stone on stone in front of me.  Finally, there was a huge blast.  It shook the ground I stood on.  Then...silence.  Except that it wasn't silent, because i could hear a faint clicking...and a sound that reminded me of the clicking of my own breastplate armor as I am running.  Then there was nothing.  Nothing until you arrived.  Thank you once more.  You rescued me from a certainly long and painful death.  I am endebted to you.  All of you.  Now...about the box.  I have no grasp of what could possibly be contained, and what the monks were protecting, but I DO know that they went to a lot of trouble to protect it.  As far as actually opening it goes, I see no reason why you shouldn't let your own heart decide that.  I personally have no reason to look further.  Although it may contain some potent magic or even some clue as to why this place of solitude was disturbed by such evil forces.  No, I am through with the box.  I have protected it. And at the loss of my new friends.  These people who supported me in my time of chaos.  And now it's over. I've protected the box. My promise is fulfilled.&quot;<br>
With that, Toric takes the back of his hand to his forehead to wipe the sweat that has beaded there.  He then looks once more upon the monk. &quot;Thank you for the kind hand friend.&quot; And with a quick nod, Toric recognizes a kindred spirit to whom he owes his life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=monkeysandhandgrenades>monkeysandhandgrenades</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Burning Cleric</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(2/19/03 9:10:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> grrr...</span><hr size=1> OC: ok..that<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  is supposed to be a P...sorry...darned html.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wintarroze@faeryfirealongthenightshore>WintarRoze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>rosey-posey pal</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(2/20/03 7:59:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ho hum</span><hr size=1> &quot;Toric it seems as though you are weary.

He even finds himself enjoying the dwarf's company and his often humorous comments.  He is caught by surprise however when the stout fighter stops mid-sentence.  Toric turns to find him deep in thought.  He then sees Gheant say something..to the box?? Just then, it opens.  Toric can't help but feel deep pride in the diminuitive warrior's ability to solve a riddle over which he himself toiled for hours in his forced solitude.  Toric moves in to see what the dwarf has earned them.  He makes it to within 5 feet, from which point he can plainly make out a very beaten up deck of cards and some parchment that he cannot yet read.  As he moves in to view the prizes more closely, his eyes fall upon the talisman, and he stops dead in his tracks.  He can feel something...strange...about this piece of jewelry.  He takes no time to consider the origin or purpose of the jewelry, but he makes haste in moving to avoid it.  He turns briskly to return to the main chamber when he notices the sorceress moving not away from, but towards the box.  Toric can't help but think that the combination of an already competent magician such as this elf-woman and this strange talisman would NOT be such a good idea. He cannot, however, bring himself to make any move to help or hinder the sorceress.  His own fear and amazement overcome him as she picks up the ornament.  A visible change comes over the cleric's face.  A storm is brewing across his brow, as if the forces of nature are battling themselves in this man's heart.  Suddenly, the storm breaks and the fire returns to his gaze, but he gets nowhere. Even as the cleric moves to act, he stands transfixed and terrified by the events that are traspiring.  Now he fights against the inactin, but still he fails.  Toric stands still and silent as a sentry, watching, waiting, expecting SOMETHING in his heart of hearts......but unsure of what exactly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfaeryfirealongthenightshore.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nyar999>nyar999</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.coneyislandwhitefish.com/fly.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Deus Ex Machina / Causa Sui</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#333333>(2/27/03 5:44:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffaeryfirealongthenightshorefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: trapped in transition</span><hr size=1> <br>

DM: not really understanding where all these negative vibes are coming from guys.. for one thing, i never meant for your repulsion to the talisman to be OVERWHELMING. just keep that in mind.

her.  As his thumb graces the cards, he abruptly glances down, and after a few seconds, shoves it back into the dwarf's grasp as he glances away.
