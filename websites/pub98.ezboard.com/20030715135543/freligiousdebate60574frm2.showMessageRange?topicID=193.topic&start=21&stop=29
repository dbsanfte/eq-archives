<br>
If that same Muslim or atheist student wants to pursue a study of choral music and take it into their college years and beyond, it would be at her own great disadvantage not to be versed in certain classic choral works.  I'm not sure how complete your understanding of choral instruction is, but it is true that you cannot teach singing properly without religiously themed music.  If you restricted your study of vocal performance to leider, madrigals, and contemporary secular works you would have no familiarity with counterpoint, fugue, melismas.  Not to mention that some of the very best examples of tonal painting are in religously-themed music.  <br>
<br>
&quot;It is a purely selfish and narrow-minded view to think that just because the majority doesn’t object or the minorities can opt out it is somehow fair.&quot;<br>
I don't believe that's what's happening in the case we're discussing.  If you choose to study voice at the HS or college level you have to know that a complete education requires the study and performance of religoius-themed music.  I don't think it's selfish or narrow-minded to expect choral instruction to include the best of choral works.  Are you so willing to compromise the education of those students who would like to continue the study of music in college?  Would you also strip English classes of all literature mentioning a Xian god?  There's a point at which we throw the baby out with the bath water, dontcha think?<br>

<br>
I have no problem, for example with my chidlren reading bible passages or William Blake poetry, studying the Sistine Chapel or Michelangelo's David anymore than I would them learning Mozart's requiem or Hayden's famous choral piece. It's all about context and delivery. When ANY subject is being approached objectively, presented for it's educational merit and studied rather than used to celebrate or pray it is not a violation as it is a value-added part of the curriculum. I taught about the Crusades, Reformation and rise of Am religions many times and parts of that included reading things like the Luther's Theses, xian poetry, etc. Only if I had led the class in a prayer using one of these or claimed it was the truth or asked it they be read as part of our &quot;All Saint's Day&quot; celebration would it have crossed the line. KWIM? And for the record, both of my children will attend public school--one already does, so all this is very real for me as it is for Trish.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do we criticize our schools for trying to censor education due to secular subject matter, but applaud them for censoring something with religious subject matter?&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, Stacey--these are usually two different groups and I don't agree with the use of censorship in both cases. I'm totally anti-censorship so am pained by the Salinger, Rand and other bannings but the religious subject matter thing is a 1st amendment issue and I would approach it as above. Never ban reading of/discussion/debate of said materials especialy in context of time period/culture being studied, but definitely ban school sponsored religious celebrations and rituals (Xmas pagent, Easter Party/egg hunt, Halloween party, Valentine's party--what a huge money sucking wast of money/sugar that last one is). <br>

Art and music are expressions of the deepest feelings within the human experience and religion (whether one believes in a god or not) has a place in that.

Let me answer your question before it gets too buried...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm not sure, though, were you saying that you would or would not like your kids to sing secular tunes like &quot;Let it Snow&quot;? I wasn't following what your opinion was of that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I would most likely not let my kids sing in a program that had &quot;Let it Snow&quot; in it, but not necessarily because of the content of the song.  I am assuming alot here, but I know that when I was a kid there was a big movement to take God and Jesus out of the school winter program.  Even though God and Jesus were taken out (we sang only secular songs) there were still many references to Christmas.  Like &quot;It's Beginning to Look A Lot Like Chirstmas&quot;  I don't think that God or Jesus are mentioned in that song at all, but it is a reference to the holiday. (Is that even that actual name?)<br>
<br>
We, as Jehovah's Witnesses, do not want to associate with anything that has to do with the holiday of Christmas.  So, if the school has a Chistmas tree up during the performance in the background, I would not approve of my kids participating.<br>
Plus, this may sound lame, but most winter songs have been tied to the Christmas season for so long that it is almost difficult to seperate the secular from the religious, so singing even a secular winter song makes people think that you are singing about the holiday.<br>
<br>
I hope that I answered your question.<br>

And in the interest of full disclosure, let me tell you that I am pagan (also UU), and our family celebrates Solstice (Yule) as our kind of &quot;sacred&quot; holiday--we do Santa and all that as our secular holiday (and the same with Ostara and Easter, Samhain and Halloween).<br>
That said, I wonder how you--or anyone else jump in here--feels about celebrating or acknowledging the natural phenomenon (for want of a better word) of the solstices and equinoxes? These are occurances in nature that we all experience, along with the change of the seasons.  How would you feel about a teacher--who may or may not follow an earth-based spirituality herself--incorporating time to reflect on the change of seasons?  What would or would you not like to see included in a class event like this, if anything?<br>

<br>
I don't have a problem with the teaching of natural seasons.  In fact, like Shirene said the school already teaches some of this.  Now, if you put a spiritual twist into it, like the whole Mother Nature/Mother Earth thing (not trying to be disrespectful, just not sure what terms to use here) where nature has a personality or the earth does, that I don't agree with.  But, the teaching of why the leaves change colors and how plants.<br>
<br>
You said something about &quot;celebrating&quot; the solsitices or equinoxes...This we already do not do by not celebrating Easter or Chirstmas and I don't agree with celebrating any of them.  Acknowledging them is a different thing.  If something happens we automatically acknowledge it and so I wouldn't deny that they happen.  I as a Witness give credit to God that these things happen and these remarkable natural phenomenons are due to Him so He is who I celebrate (for lack of a better term).  I just don't do it in public schools.<br>
<br>
Did any of that make sense, I felt like I got way off track.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
