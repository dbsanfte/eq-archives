<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Description</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
She stands about 5’7 feet with no heels and weighs approximately 125 pds. She has all her curves and doesn’t lack in attention. Her hair is a honey blonde colour which she prefers to wear long. Sometimes it will be curly and sometimes she will keep it straight. She tries various styles with it and loves to put it up as well. Her eyes are a hazel/green colour, depending on her mood. She wears business type of clothing and is rarely seen outside her house in anything. When she is in the privacy of her own home, where no one can see her, she likes to wear dangerous clothing; risk taking and daring.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Personality</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
In her place of business and out in public, she is quiet and dignified. An all business attitude. She tries to maintain a front where she is just a human to the outside world, almost to the point where she almost believes it herself. But privately, in her own home, the blood lust eats her alive. She lives on the edge and is a totally different person. She pushes her feeding to the very last minute, to the point where she acts almost insane. None or very few people see her like this.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Strengths</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Daywalker<br>
Immune to Silver, Garlic and Holy items<br>
Good actress; hardly anyone knows what she truly is unless they are one of her own kind or a vampire.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Skills</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Great with numbers; a freelance accountant is one of her many jobs<br>
Over average typing skills<br>
Won awards for kickboxing when she took a course for self defense<br>
Fencing, taking a class for fun.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Abilities</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
Telepathic: can communicate in the minds of others but only with dhampires and fledgling vampires. She hasn’t tried it on humans yet but figures she could with the weak minded ones. She can only do this if they are within a mile radius of her and she can only talk to them, she can’t read their minds.<br>
<br>
Blocking: She has the skill to block others from reading her mind. Of course strong minded and ancient vampires can easily break through her blocks but not fledglings, other dhampires or any type of humans.<br>
<br>
Strength and Stealth: She isn’t as strong as her sire is but she can lift up to 300 pds easily. She wouldn’t be able to throw it very far though. She is quick and agile on her feet. Not so fast that she is blur but fast enough. If she sticks to the shadows she can blend into them but can’t turn into one.<br>
<br>
Healing: She can heal minor cuts, bruises and small bones. But anything that is too severe and more then that, it would exhaust her too much. She might try to help the healing process but she would have to sleep constantly for strength. She would be better off going to the hospital.<br>
<br>
Dreamwalking: Inherited from her sire, she can enter human dreams and either participate or just observe. But unlike her sire, she can’t really talk to the people through the dreams and make suggestions. She doesn’t have his hypnotic capabilities.<br>
<br>
Smoke and Mirrors: Another inherited ability from her sire. She can appear and disappear in a mirror but unlike her sire, its only in appearance and not for real. To make her appearance more dramatic, she can call in a light fog but not as much as her sire could have.<br>
<br>
Animal Knowledge: Because she can’t shape shift into the wolf that her sire could, the most she has is the fact that wolves recognize his blood in her and have befriended her. They help her when she needs them and calls them, and she tries to do the same for them as much as she can.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Weaknesses</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Cannot update her abilities.<br>
Her abilities cannot overpower a vampires<br>
Mortal and susceptible to diseases<br>
A painful, not pleasure inducing bite<br>
No shape changing<br>
Socially unaccepted by vampires and hunted by hunters<br>
Constantly craves blood, and in her case its severe and as strong as a vampires craving<br>
Will get dangerous and risk taking with lack of blood in her system<br>
Afraid of people finding out who/what she really is<br>
Lies constantly to avoid the above which with some people is a bad thing<br>
Sexually promiscuous when she is her other self at home; blood isn’t the only thing she craves<br>
Doesn’t know who her sire is<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">History</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Hers is a simple history. She is the only child to two loving parents. She lead an average life with no big events other then the normal ones such as proms, boyfriends and graduations. It was after her university graduation, when she was walking home from going out with friends that she was sired into the person she has become. It was dark and she really didn’t see who he was. All she knew was that it was a man. She had heard a few men talking about a drug hit and money so she is under the assumption that the one that sired her was part of the mob or worse, a gang. But that’s her only lead. She doesn’t even think that he meant to sire her as he drank from her as much as he could and just leaving her in the alley for dead. Most likely because she over heard them talking about their plans. But instead she turned into a dhampire, now craving blood among other things. She hated what she has turned into and tries to keep it a secret. She moved out of her parents home and never invites people over, so no one will find out about that side of her. If she ever finds her sire, she plans on killing him if she can. She hopes that might give her a chance for a cure.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:orange;font-family:century gothic;font-size:small;">~Courage, love, friendship, compassion and empathy lift us above the simple beasts and define humanity.~</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;font-family:times new roman;font-size:x-small;">(The Book of Counted Sorrows)</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isabelladociera>Isabella Dociera</A> at: 7/17/03 8:18 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isabelladociera>Isabella Dociera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/19/03 7:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/IsabellaDociera.jpg HEIGHT=200 width=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lena</span><hr size=1> Very interesting concept.
