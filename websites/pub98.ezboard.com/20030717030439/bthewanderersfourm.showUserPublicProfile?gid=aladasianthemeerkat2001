*pinches your cheeks*</span></div> 		<div id="personalbio"><span class="title">Personal Bio ::</span> <span class="value">Hi! As if you haven't noticed, my name is Aladasian W. Suricatus... a fun-lovin' anthro meerkat that haunts the scene on the RP chat on www.planetlionking.com. As many of the chars on there know, i was the happy-go-lucky kat in the colony which i was a member of. Everything was going according to the circle of life - until two months ago. A background study on the colony members revealed that a percentage of the residents had genetic testing done on them with human DNA - my parents included, which is the reason i was born half meerkat/half man. The elders sensed an impurity within the colony, and had revoked the status and rights of the members who had indeed recieved this "treatment" - me included. After a futile attempt to retain my status, i was ultimately ousted from my own kind. For a couple of days, i wandered listlessly through the desert until i had found a plot of land that intrigued me. I had quickly beome friends with some of the natives and was accepted, so i quickly rushed back to my family's burrow to retrieve my personal belongings. I had returned that same day and made my residence there - and i've been there ever since. One day, a battle between demis occured on the pridelands, and i was hit with an influx, which gave me the power to use magic. At first, i didn't know how to work the powers, but with the aid of Dusk360 and SDogg, i finally got the hang of it. so there you have it, so far... And now what you've all been waiting for: MY DESCRIPTION! I am a 25 year old male adult, i have white patches with black eyelids framing my blue eyes (i wear glasses though... BLEH), moderately long blond hair, light dusky orange fur, my markings are brown except my tail tip and my paws and feet which are black like a fox's and i wear the patented black "Happyface" t-shirt by Nirvana and cut-off jean shorts. So there you have it: A little bit about me and how i ended up in here... I thank you for spending the time to read my little story here and i hope to add some members to my EZBoard when you visit my hit, okay? <br></br>AND NOW, HERE IS THE STORY OF MY CHAR FROM KIMYA'S NURSERY: Hi! My name is Aladasian W. Suricatus, and i am a 24 yr. old meerkat from Cape Breton Island (a little thing on the east coast of Canada)... Now, before i go on, i must tell you a bit about myself: I was born in the serengeti... a little bundle of joy to my parents... and a total torment to everyone else! For the first 7 years, everything seemed to be moving in the path of the great circle of life... then, the unthinkable! The meerkat colony in which i had lived in, which was ruled by a great elder by the name of Nardinaos, was ransacked! A troupe of demonic hyenas had pillaged the commune, and 93% of the colony was slaughtered - my mom and dad included.
And to make the pain even more unbearable, the survivors were snapped up by poachers for the purposes of the black market animal trade - i was seperated from 
the surviving clan members and the friends i had left... never to see them again. As i entered this land, i was terrified that i didnt have what it would take for me to survive, but i needn't worry: a kindly bareskin had taken me in and taught me what i needed to know... and i've been here for the last 14 years - mere words simply just cannot describe the feelings of grace or gratitude in which i feel for his kindness and kinship... So there you go - me, in a nutshell... or some of me, anyways...<br></br>I hope that this particular profile helped you out... Oh! And by the way: NEENUR NEENUR NEENUR!</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="mailto:aladasian_the_meerkat@hotmail.com">aladasian_the_meerkat@hotmail.com</a></span> </div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">MSN - aladasian_the_meerkat</span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="http://www.geocities.com/pussboots69b/alad.html" target="_blank">Aladasian's Burrow: The Website!</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 										<span class="value">		<dl>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=2108.topic&index=246" title="post" target="_blank">Re: One Word Story!</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=306.topic&index=10695" title="post" target="_blank">Re: The second try in the longest topic ever :P</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=2118.topic&index=12" title="post" target="_blank">Re: messa baaaaaackk!</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=2112.topic&index=30" title="post" target="_blank">Re: what have you leant to day?</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=2112.topic&index=20" title="post" target="_blank">Re: what have you leant to day?</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=306.topic&index=10642" title="post" target="_blank">Re: The second try in the longest topic ever :P</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				</dl>				</span>				</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
