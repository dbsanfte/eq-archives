<br>
&quot;The murders of three American missionaries this past December in Yemen is raising questions about religious proselytizing, pluralism and efforts by foreign evangelical groups targeting a region of the globe known as the &quot;10/40 window.&quot;<br>
<br>
The three, described in news reports as &quot;U.S.  humanitarian workers,&quot;were killed by a 35-year-old man suspected of being an Islamic militant.  He told police after the incident that he shot the two men and two women &quot;to cleanse his religion and get closer to Allah.&quot;  It<br>
is still not known if he acted alone, or is linked to a terrorist organization.<br>
<br>
But the murders, rather than deterring the efforts of religious aid and conversion groups, are resulting in a new, and potentially dangerous determination to &quot;spread the word&quot; about Christianity in Third World nations already torn by sectarian conflicts, and with<br>
little history of religious pluralism and tolerance.  Critics suggest that this is leading to a &quot;backlash&quot; manifesting itself in the rise of even more xenophobic political and religious movements, as well as resentment against the United States for encouraging what amounts to<br>
theo-political and cultural imperialism.  It is, some fear, fueling the &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; prophesied by political scientists such as Samuel P.  Huntington, who suggests that the old differences over secular ideologies and economics are being replaced by even more<br>
volatile conflicts involving national identity, language, culture and, of course, religious belief.<br>
<br>
Complicating the issue is the fact that U.S.  government aid and foreign policy are often linked to missionary activities.  In the case of the Yemen assassinations, for instance, a CNN report noted that the gunman opened fire at a &quot;U.S.  - funded hospital&quot; in San'a where the<br>
victims worked.<br>
<br>
     &quot;10/40 Window&quot; -- Religious Liberty Or Cultural Hegemony?<br>
<br>
…Many [missionaries] are part of the &quot;10/40 Window Movement&quot; focusing on that region of the world between ten and forty degrees latitude, a swath of non-Christian nations stretching from the Islamic Middle East through India (Hindu), China and into Southeast Asia.<br>
<br>
&quot;The first and most fundamental reason why committed Christians must focus on The 10/40 Window is because of the biblical and historical significance of this area,&quot; notes a posting for the &quot;AD2000&quot; missionary group.  &quot;Of the world's 50 least evangelized countries, 37<br>
are within The 10/40 Window...&quot;<br>
<br>
The stakes are high on a planet where religious groups, especially Christianity, compete now vigorously for followers in an emergent &quot;belief marketplace.&quot;  The &quot;Window,&quot; also described as a realm populated by &quot;strongholds of Satan,&quot; boasts 97% of the world's<br>
population.<br>
<br>
&quot;The majority of those enslaved by Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism&quot; live here, says AD2000.<br>
<br>
Many evangelicals perceive the countries within the 10/40 Window as targets for aggressive proselytizing and conversion.  In the 1990s, there were heady efforts to &quot;carry the gospel&quot; and convert hundreds of millions of Muslims, Hindus, Animists, Buddhists and other non-Christian ethnic groups in time for the new millennium and, predicted some, the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.  The timetable proved to be unrealistic, but that has not deterred a new generation of foreign missionaries and would-be proselytizers from taking up the call…<br>
<br>
There is growing evidence, though, that this aggressive evangelism is possibly doing more harm than good.  A story in the Indian Observer newspaper warned that Christian missionaries &quot;will be making a big<br>
 mistake if they treat recent attacks on Christian missions and missionaries ...  as misdeeds of miscreants of the lunatic fringe of heathens.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The resentment against missionary machinations runs deep in the Hindu society,&quot; warned writer Virendra Parekh, &quot;though its expression remains mostly stifled or sporadic.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Most Hindus find it difficult to understand the aggressive<br>
self-righteousness of Christianity and Islam and their insistence on converting others,&quot; he adds.<br>
<br>
Comparable attitudes exist in many Islamic, Sinic/Buddhist and other non-Christian nations, where missionaries -- especially those backed by U.S.  dollars -- are viewed with suspicion, or even considered<br>
agents of foreign powers.  Throughout the Muslim world, for instance, there is the &quot;Islamic Resurgence&quot; that mirrors aggressive Christian proselytizing, creating what historian John L.  Esposito describes as &quot;an Islamic awakening in personal life.&quot;<br>
<br>
Esposito notes that this process is characterized by a constellation of behaviors, including &quot;increased attention to religious observance, proliferation of religious programming and publications, more emphasis<br>
on Islamic dress and values...&quot;  He adds that many Muslim governments,<br>
including the more nominally secular states of Turkey and Tunisia, are &quot;becoming aware of the potential strength of Islam, have shown increased sensitivity to and anxiety about Islamic issues...&quot;<br>
<br>
The historical record supports the claims that with evangelical meddling come unexpected consequences and often deadly political developments.  Paul Cohen in his definitive work &quot;China and Christianity: The Missionary Movement and the Growth of Chinese<br>
Antiforeignism&quot; (Harvard University Press, 1963) noted that broad resentment to missionary proselytizing found voice among all classes of Chinese society.  As is the case today with many Third World nations under assault by Christian groups, the Chinese developed<br>
&quot;deep-seated resentment&quot; and perceived Christianity as integrally linked to foreign imperialism.  Missionary activity also had the effect of &quot;disrupting the Chinese political and judicial system.&quot;<br>
<br>
It remains problematic that even in countries where Christian missionaries enjoy free reign and high rates of success, this automatically leads to a more enlightened and especially secular culture.  Throughout Latin America, for instance, there is aggressive<br>
proselytizing and recruitment by well-funded Protestant evangelical groups, Mormons and even New Age sects that is slowly eroding the status and authority of the Roman Catholic Church.  As with the confrontation between Islam and western Christianity, however, neither<br>
party wants the establishment of a truly secular culture, a civil society with separation of mosque-church and state; expansive rights for women and sexual minorities; and robust, meaningful freedom of expression, including the right to question or criticize prevailing religious institutions.  Instead, it is a &quot;turf war&quot; for believers,<br>
followers and ultimately power.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The two things I find most interesting are:<br>
1. The negative effects this is having on our American image as cultural imperialists monetarily and ideologically supporting these efforts to subvert the beliefs and traditions of other peoples (in other words, conversions aside, what are the political implications of this behavior wth our global neighbors?)<br>
<br>
2. The fact that in more open and democratic societies where this occurs, the author seems to point out the the outcome is a more secular society and so the prosyletizing backfires. In an effort to grab believers for their own, the competing faiths end up &quot;causing&quot; a general loss of faith and increased secularization in the country--notably in Central and South America.<br>
<br>
I'll refrain from giving any personal opinion up front....thoughts?? Particularly interested in non-American and Islamic members? How do you see this xian American evangalism?<br>

Actually, I don't like it, but there can sometimes be a little good associating from it like providing medical care or food for downtrodden people.  One of the big reasons I don't like it is because I feel they are looking to snatch people while they are down.  Instead of advocating for people and trying to fix problems at the governmental level where they stem, they pounce on them for conversion as if each new convert will score them an extra prize in heaven.  I also don't agree with trying to push your religion on people who already have one.  If someone is Muslim, then let them stay Muslim.  Don't dangle food and medical care over their head tied to a crucifix.  The problem in the Muslim countries isn't Islam, it is the corrupt governments who are using Islam as a front for their actions.  These people don't need a new religion, they need a new government.  I also feel that missionaries are putting others in harm's way.  They put themselves in dangerous situations, and then they need rescuing.  Well, the rescuers have to put their lives on the line to fetch these people out.  There are hostages in the Phillipines on a regular basis, yet people still go there to spread &quot;the word&quot;.  One of my friend's parents are missionaries in the Phillipines, and a very close friend of their family was murdered by terrorists earlier this year.  This was the family where the wife was rescued, but the husband was killed.  This was upsetting for our friends, and now they get to worry about her parents on top of that.  Another one of my friends has parents who are missionaries in Indonesia.  I can't say their mission is all negative because my friend is Indonesian, and her parents adopted her and brought her here to the states to live a normal life instead of one of poverty.  However, they are right back in Indonesia where it is dangerous.  My friend isn't religious, so needless to say she is living right here in the good ole USA.  I've met both sets of parents, and I know they mean well at heart.  However, they are putting a lot of worry on their children by putting their lives in danger like that, and they are potentially putting other people in danger if they need rescuing.  If they were just there to help in a secular fashion, then there would still be some dangers, but not as many as when they are trying to pass their religion around.  This tactic angers people who might not normally be angered by their presence.  <br>

<br>
The LDS philosophy is that we dont proselytize in any country that doesnt want us there.  But we also have the belief that all who don't have to opportunity to hear the gospel in this life will have the opporunity in the spirit world before they are resurrected, so we do not feel that if we dont go there they will be damned.<br>
<br>
From the perspective of a religion that feels that it is absolutely necessary for a person to hear and accept the gospel of Jesus Christ in this life or else they will be damned, missionary work is the only compassionate thing to do.  It is the way to help save your fellow brothers and sisters.  <br>
<br>
If a person is truly convicted in their beliefs, it would be illogical to accept that it is ok to not &quot;witness&quot; to someone because they already have a religion.  Part of beleiving in your faith is the belief that what you believe is true and as in science truth is absolute.  <br>
<br>
It is not logical that Muslim Hindu Christianity etc. are all correct as they contradict each other.  So a good Christian, is compelled by their faith to risk life and limb to share the word, because this life is only temporary and the responsibility is with believers to help others gain eternal happiness.<br>
<br>
So I get why they are there.  I do think that it can have reprecussions.<br>
<br>
While serving my mission in Central America,  some of the men I served with were on occasion thought to be CIA becuase they were clean cut Americans in suits.  We got a kick out of it, and it was never a question of safety, because Costa Rica is very pro-USA.  They are a democratic society and have very similar values politically.  But in other areas such as Panama or Nicaragua, it was a safety concern at times.<br>
<br>
As far as protestant and LDS faiths decreasing the hold that the Roman Catholic church has on the gov't.  I have to say that yes it does produce a more secular gov't, but through that it opens the door for the people of those countries to be able to practice freedom of religion.  Just as our(US) secular gov't opens the door for each person to practice their own religion as they will.  <br>
<br>
When any one gov't (as in the areas of 10/40) or So America in the early years controls the laws and governing body,  it does not increase the faith of the people.  True faith/religiosity comes from a choice from within, not from being forced to act a certain (religiously defined)way.<br>
<br>
I have been listening to a very interesting book on tape about Islam.  I did not know the origins of that church other than it was based on the teachings of a prophet Mohamed.  Mohamed unlike most professed prophets was also a political leader, so his teachings also encompassed how to create a political environment that benefits the soul of a good muslim.  It is intertwined.  It is part of their faith to create Muslim governments, but in the early history fof Islam, tolerance of other religions existed.  Mohamed even went outside a Christian church that he was touring to do his prayers so that his followers would not feel that they had license to desecrate that church.<br>
<br>
Just as Christians have different denominations that have interpreted the bible differently, some muslims have twisted or taken out of context the original teachings of Mohamed.<br>
<br>
So IMO I think that the clashes are inevitable and I just hope that repsect for life which is part of all faiths and non -faith philosophies can prevail.  <br>
<br>
Very interesting thought provoking topic.  One that has been on my mind since the death of those missionaries. -- Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ctrlaltdelirious>CtrlAltDelirious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/7/03 3:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/cordelia/images/heartsandstars.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: interesting topic</span><hr size=1> This is from a State Department Travel Advisary for Yemen:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>November 30, 2002 <br>
<br>
This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning for Yemen dated March 18, 2002. It notes credible reports that terrorists have planned attacks against U.S. interests in Yemen. The security threat to all American citizens in Yemen remains high. <br>
<br>
The Department of State reaffirms its warning to United States citizens to defer travel to Yemen. The Department has received credible reports that terrorists associated with al-Qaeda have planned attacks against U.S. interests in Yemen, and the Department anticipates that threats against American citizens in Yemen will continue.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Recently while watching a documentary on terrorist groups they showed a clip of a recruitment video where they were shooting at targets.  The targets were shaped like people with the Xian cross on it.<br>
<br>
Also consider the Xians caught in Afghanistan prior to 9/11, they were actively trying to convert people to Xianity despite the fact that it was against the law in that country at that time.<br>
<br>
I think some missionary groups are too aggresive in their attempts, and show reckless disregard for other countries laws and customs, which has led to the extreme reactions of already extremist people.  <br>

Anyway..I'll try to summarise....<br>
<br>
The whole idea of missionaries makes my skin crawl to be honest - the arrogance of the whole thing is astounding.<br>
<br>
I just find it morally wrong to prey on the vunerable in that way...I have probably got a skewed view of it all (and I really hope I have)..but the impression I get goes something like this...&quot;ok..so you need this sack of grain/bottle of antibiotics for your family..no problem....just accept jesus as your saviour and commit to attending our church once a week (and denouncing your current faith)..and you can have it&quot;..like I said...hopefully that is very skewed!<br>

I agree with whoever said that the religion of a country isn't the problem (ie. Islam)..if you *truely* want to help people..then try to make grass roots changes...don't go out there with so much arrogance and try and force your beliefs (which lets face it, can never be verified) on people who need your help..if you really want to help, then help just for the sake of helping...not through some misguided need to &quot;save their souls&quot;! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mormongirl2>Mormongirl2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/8/03 1:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  &quot;misguided&quot;</span><hr size=1> &quot;Misguided&quot; is a personal judgement call - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaia25>Gaia25</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/8/03 5:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Misguided</span><hr size=1> Yes I agree..it is a very personal thing - as is religion....it is hugely arrogant (imo) to decide what is best for other people, and push that on them in their time of need!  <br>

The most successful religions (judeo/xian) are based on a war god.  The lord of hosts.  Wreaker of vengeance, even if it is a first strike.  Faith is an abdication of responsibility for thinking.  You believe what is not supported by evidence.  They have to convince you that to question them is wrong.  Religion is a tool for controlling the masses.  The Aztecs killed people and ate them.  Excellent source of meat in an otherwise challenged environment.  Successful because it promoted the survival of the adherents at the expense of its competitors.   Hindu believe a cow is sacred.  The families that held this belief didn’t kill and eat their cattle in lean times.  The families that did kill the cattle were then unable to plow the following year and starved and died.  The environment was not affluent enough to support herds of cattle and people.  The religion successfully promoted the survival of its adherents.  Xianity, by virtue of its built-in evangelical doctrine spreads itself like cancer.  They don’t care if people already have a faith.  They don’t care if they are not wanted or welcomed.  They can bundle their distasteful medicine with the sugar-coating of a benevolent gift.  They are blind to the cultural erosion and egotistical in their perspective that they are saving someone from something they made up to begin with.  Just as the cannibalistic aztecs, xians promote the survival of their doctrines at the expense of its competitors.  There is only one god (one more than is needed apparently.)  No room for diversity.  <br>
<br>
Yup, misguided may be a judgement call, but it is the judgement of the one who IS misguided that is the problem.  Sorry you find discomfort in it.<br>

I think they instead use their authority to convince people.  They gain authority by coming in with resources for these people.  Anybody who has something you want can become an authority figure, even if you are just simply asking that person for directions to the nearest gas station.  The downtrodden are looking at their providers as authority figures, and they in turn are accepting their influence.  This is much the same way people influence their children's beliefs.  Nobody tells their children &quot;accept Christ or you are grounded&quot;.  Instead children look up to their parents as their ultimate authority because their parents are their providers and have control over their lives.  It isn't until children become older that the &quot;God concept&quot; with their parents starts to diminish.  Same goes for those less fortunate.  If you are starving to death and someone comes in and offers your food, then you are going to be grateful, and you will look up to this person who provided you with something that you couldn't provide yourself with.  When they tell you about Christ, then you are most likely going to listen.  <br>

OK, this is not missionary work.  This is charity.  Furthermore, the fact that your denomination chooses to participate in it, while admirable, generous and kind, has no bearing on what it endorses for theological doctrines.  It could just as easily be done by the same people secularly.<br>
<br>
Charity work = good.<br>
Missionary work = bad.<br>
<br>
If your denomination does missionary work as well, then it remains bad.  Just like Robin Hood in the move &quot;Time Bandits&quot;, giving the poor a handout is good, but punching them in the mouth fot it is bad.  Yes, you can combine good things with bad things and try and gloss over the bad parts.  Ask Mother Theresa's marketing agent about it. <p>DBC67<br>

Critics say proselytizing can reflect negatively on other relief groups and governments.<br>
By Mark O'Keefe, Religion News Service | posted 04/04/2003<br>
<br>
Will proselytizing in Iraq offer comfort and hope to a nation that is 97 percent Muslim?<br>
<br>
Or will it reinforce the growing perception of Muslims worldwide that the war, no matter what President Bush says, is against Islam, not Saddam Hussein?<br>
<br>
The largest American Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention, recently announced plans to send relief workers into Iraq to address both physical and spiritual needs. Samaritan's Purse, a relief organization headed by the Rev. Franklin Graham, has similar plans, as do other evangelical relief organizations.<br>
<br>
Criticism was both swift and harsh.<br>
<br>
Other faith-based relief groups said that proselytizing would tarnish their own humanitarian efforts in Muslim countries.<br>
<br>
Several critics said that private relief groups are considered extensions of their governments in the Islamic world. Consequently, said Dan O'Neil, co-founder of Mercy Corps, based in Portland, Ore., &quot;we have to pay the price of groups that don't play by the generally accepted rules of humanitarian engagement.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some relief groups make proselytizing a firing offense.<br>
<br>
&quot;We try to open our hearts to others and see the full dimension of God in their experience,&quot; said Tom Getman, the Geneva-based director of humanitarian affairs and international relations for World Vision, a Christian group. &quot;So we have a firm policy that we must never use a gift to persuade people to believe as we believe.&quot;<br>
<br>
At its root, the proselytism issue is over religious values and interpretation of biblical passages.<br>
<br>
Evangelicals believe they have a duty to share the &quot;good news&quot; of the gospel. They cite Jesus' last words to his followers urging them to go forth and &quot;make disciples of all nations.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Great Commission is as natural a part of faithfulness to our Lord as loving our neighbors or being kind to the needy or living a faithful relationship with your spouse,&quot; said Jonathan Bonk, editor of the International Bulletin of Missionary Research, based in New Haven, Conn.<br>
<br>
&quot;So it's normal for Christians to want to proclaim the gospel. From their perspective, it's really good news, and to ignore that is to abdicate one's responsibility, not only to God, but to one's neighbor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Samaritan's Purse, the Southern Baptist Convention, World Concern and World Relief, the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, say they plan to send relief workers into Iraq.<br>
<br>
All the groups say they are taking no government money for their efforts and they will be sensitive, even subtle, in their approach. Receptivity to a religious message, they say, will never be a requirement to receive food, water, shelter or any other aid.<br>
<br>
The image of Bible-toting missionaries marching into Iraq as Christian soldiers is inaccurate, they argue, because for the most part, the gospel will be shared only in private, in response to queries from curious individuals.<br>
<br>
Teri Johnson, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based World Concern, said there will be no religious services or Bible studies. &quot;We don't proselytize in the sense people think of proselytizing,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;What we do is provide for people's needs. Then we look for appropriate ways within the culture to communicate the love of Christ.<br>
<br>
&quot;A lot of times, that can just be by our actions and showing them that we love them. But if it's appropriate, and people ask us, we'll also talk about what it means to us to be Christians.&quot;<br>
<br>
Galen Carey, director of advocacy and policy for Baltimore-based World Relief, said the group has no formal policy about proselytizing, but that common sense prevails.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have to be sensitive to improper influence,&quot; Carey said. &quot;We have no interest as Christians to see the emergence of what some call `rice Christians'—people who pretend to become Christians, but really aren't. We know we need to respect the dignity and the freedom of the Iraqi people.&quot;<br>
<br>
How Muslims perceive evangelicals is important, especially since Bush himself is an evangelical Christian with strong ties to Graham, who said a prayer at his inauguration, and to Southern Baptists, who have been loyal supporters, said Ingrid Mattson, assistant professor of Islamic studies at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut.<br>
<br>
&quot;The impression all this gives to people, whether it's true or not, is that there may be a motive of the administration that they're not openly stating, that they want to change the underlying nature of the region, and part of that is to push Christianity,&quot; said Mattson, who is also vice president of the Islamic Society of North America.<br>
<br>
She said the best thing the Bush administration could do to counteract that impression is to make sure Muslim relief organizations are working beside Christian ones in Iraq.<br>
<br>
But Ellen Yount, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Development, which helps coordinate and fund relief efforts, said given that the groups are &quot;private charitable organizations and activities, we don't have any legal jurisdiction over them.&quot;<br>
<br>
In other words, unless government money is involved, faith-based relief groups are free to proselytize, or not to proselytize, as they wish.<br>

Actually that was 'Umar, the second caliph, when he was in Jerusalem; the Prophet Muhammad never travelled far enough to see a church once he began his mission.  Just wanted to clarify that.  But he was really big on leaving other people alone as long as they left you alone.<br>

As to the issue of missionaries, I obviously am not a supporter of this idea.  I don't have any problem with people sharing their thoughts and beliefs, but it should be done in proper context.. not when one has &quot;something over&quot; the other, be it aid or power or authority; I have also seen reports where missionaries have tried to &quot;trick&quot; people, for example using Islamic or Hindu customs as &quot;templates&quot; to attract people, but have Christianity lurking underneath.  To me, this demeans the faith, because you're saying that it's not good enough to be simply presented at face value, it has to be surreptitious.<br>
<br>
The problem, I think, is in the overall impression.  We have a president who is openly Christian, who has pushed and gotten funding for &quot;faith-based&quot; charity groups (probably most if not all of whom will be Christian), and Christian groups in the US insulting other faiths.  Each of these individually may be a small wave, but to the person looking on from these groups, it looks like a tsunami.<br>
