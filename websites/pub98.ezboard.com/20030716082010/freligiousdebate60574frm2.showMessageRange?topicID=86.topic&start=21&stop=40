Indeed he was.  What's unclear to you about his belief in God?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I don't really need to explain when the man himself covered it so thoroughly:<br>
<br>
Yes he did, and while it's clear he wasn't a big fan of organized religion, it's equally clear that he did believe in God.  You didn't pay attention to his claim that he wasn't an atheist.  Why not?  Rock your world too much or what?<br>
<br>
There is a big difference between saying &quot;I don't believe in &quot;religion&quot;&quot; and &quot;I don't believe in God.&quot;. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;In practical application, there is no difference between a deist and an atheist.<br>
<br>
Now there's a big juicy rationalization if ever I heard one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Neither one believes in an involved god. <br>

One however DOES believe that God exists.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;We live our lives based on there being no god watching and waiting to punish us with the fiction of hell or damnation.<br>
<br>
I don't believe in hell either, but I certainly believe in God, and you and are quite different in our &quot;practical application&quot; of our beliefs.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The only constructive difference, which ammounts to nothing in practical living, is that a deist thinks this was all started by god, and an atheist doesn't.<br>
<br>
You call that a SMALL difference? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I'd say that's a rather FUNDAMENTAL difference!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Just to repeat myself once more &quot;Einstein was culturally Germanic Jewish and an atheist in practice, but he conceded the potential of deists.&quot;<br>
<br>
WRONG!  Einstein was NOT an atheist in ANY sense of the word, and he said so himself!<br>

Please oh glorious and wise one, explain how the difference of a deist who does not believe in revealed religion or an involved personal god is functiuonally any different in day to day living from an atheist?

No, I simply note that Einstein was a &quot;theist&quot; who believed in the existence of God.  He was not an atheist as you keep trying to insinuate.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I do not believe you are correct.<br>
<br>
I don't know what more I can offer you other than a DIRECT quote from the man himself speaking of God and shunning atheism.<br>

&gt;&gt;In fact, were you to replace the word in Einstiens quote with nature, it would bear the same meaning and be just as true for the way the man spoke.  I do not think it would be just as true for you however.<br>
<br>
I actually equate God with nature, so that works for me.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Again, I will tell you, he was in practice an atheist.<br>

Again I will quote Einstein for you so you can see with your own eyes that he was NOT an atheist in ANY sense of the word.<br>

<br>
Maybe you should respect his wishes and stop putting words in his mouth and stop trying to equate his beliefs with atheism since clearly he resented such nonsense.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;He performed no worship.<br>
<br>
So what if he shunned religion, so do I.  That doesn't make me an atheist!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;He functioned in life as would one without a god. Big brother was not looking over his shoulder. <br>
<br>
He clearly had a different relationship with God than I do, but he just as clearly DID belief in the existence of God.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Please oh glorious and wise one, explain how the difference of a deist who does not believe in revealed religion or an involved personal god is functiuonally any different in day to day living from an atheist?<br>
<br>
A deists believes in God.  You do not.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Where does this ammount to any difference in practical living? <br>
<br>
It's hard to say exactly what affect this had on Einsteins life.  I know he spent it looking for evidence of God through nature rather than playing a denial game like most atheists.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Do they attend a church? Follow a dogma? Preach a creed?  Observe any ritualistic service or pray in any way?<br>
<br>
Do I do any of these things?  No!   Well, I occasionally pray, but usually that God's will be done.  That hardly would suggest my life and yours are in any way the same.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;No. Hence, no practical difference. No difference in practice. No difference. <br>
<br>
Yes, BIG difference.  Einstein didn't spend his life with his head buried in the sand, or in denial of our creator.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Call that a rationalization if you will but you would be using poor logic in doing so.<br>
<br>
It is a very BIG and JUICY rationalization on your part, and I think it's not only poor logic for you to do that, but in direct conflict with the wishes of Einstein as well.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Please again quote the book thing for us a fifth time in 3 posts.<br>
<br>
I'll continue to do it until you wake up and smell the coffee!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;He does not believe in a personal or revealed god. He acknowledges the belief of Deists. He was not a Theist. <br>
<br>
A deist is simply a subset of theism!  He did believe in the existence of a creator and looked for evidence of this creator IN nature.  Technically speaking that makes him a &quot;theist&quot; as opposed to an &quot;atheist&quot; which he clearly REJECTED in writing.  Furthermore he very much resented folks like you mislabeling him and suggesting his beliefs in any way supported the notion of atheism.

You can admire the works of an artists, authors, or sculpters. You can marvel at the beauty revealed, enjoy the words on the page and the images they create in your mind. But rarely do you worship the creator of those works. And most artists, authors and sculpters, etc once finished with a work move on from it. Our creator set things in action, and has moved on. To interfer would destroy what was created.  So marvel and enjoy yes...be astonished. Fine. Worship? No.<br>

IMO theism is the offspring of deism. <br>
<br>
I detect something in existance that is more than I can explain. I call that God. It just is. It doens't interact with me, it just waits for me to notice and understand. <br>
<br>
Theists call that God, too, and then try to figure out what God wants of them, why we are here, why God created us. They assign human characteristics to God. Then they create a complex set of traditions one must follow to please God. Then they start deciding that the only way to please God is to do as they do. Then they argue over who is doing it right and split up into smaller groups. All the while reflecting their own culture, envirionment and desires. <br>
<br>
I would say that in day to day practice I could be considered an atheist by theists. Mind you, the theists I know are mostly Christian and Jewish. I don't really know enough about Buddhist or Wiccan theology, but I have found that they think more along my line than the former two. <br>
<br>
I put the future of our existance in the hands of man.  Some people act for the benefit of others as well as themselves, and others act for themselves. I believe that we have all the tools necessary to solve any problem, we just need to look for it. I don't place the future of humans in divine hands. I don't see life as planned, but rather an experiment. I think God is curious to see how we will turn out, but without any expectations. There are patterns we may follow, but nothing is certain except that we most likely will procreate and that we will eventually die.  <br>
<br>
I myself give prayers of thanks for this gift of existance.  It makes me feel good to look around and realize how lucky I am to be able to see all of this. It makes me feel closer to myself, if that makes sense. But I feel that to  be much closer to an atheist's outlook than the outlook of the majortity of theists that I know.<br>

The main question theism raises is whether God should be seen only as transcendent, that is, beyond the limits of human experience and the material world. Could God not also be seen as immanent in them as well, having existence and effect in human consciousness and the material world? Theists generally claim that attempts to make God immanent in humanity and nature are pantheistic, and therefore, unacceptable to theistic religion. The philosopher and theologian Paul Tillich reconciled these two views by claiming that &quot;God is neither in another nor in the same space as the world. [God] is the creative ground of the spatial structure of the world, but he [sic] is not bound to the structure, positively or negatively. . . .God is immanent in the world as its permanent creative ground and is transcendent to the world through freedom.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
I hate to break it to both of you, but the definition of theism does NOT exclude &quot;deism&quot;.  In other words, all one needs to be a &quot;theist&quot; is to believe in the existence of God.  If one CHOOSES to relate to religious belief, great, but personally I do not, yet I am clearly a &quot;theist&quot; in that I believe God exists.  Because I reject religion, I could also be rightly labeled a &quot;deist&quot;, depending on what other baggage one cares to attach to the label.  The same is true of Einstein!  I am VERY functionally different than any atheist I've ever met (myself included when I embraced atheism) even though I do not put much faith in religion.<br>
<br>
Now how MightyK and Einstein &quot;practiced&quot; there beliefs are a totally different question from the issue of whether or not Einstein believed in a creator.  The bottom line is that Einstein DID believe in a God who reveals himself through nature.<br>
<br>
Einstein WAS functionally different from an atheist who never bothers to lift a finger to find God or attempt to understand God.  He was also functionally different than an atheist in that he BELIEVED WE WERE &quot;CREATED&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now you folks can dance around labels for days if you like, and play games with words, but Einstein clearly stated that he was NOT an atheist, and didn't believe he could define himself as a &quot;pantheist&quot;.  Furthermore he resented being used to support the notion of atheism in any way.  It seems to me if we are going to be fair to the man, we should respect his wishes and acknowledge what he bluntly stated. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> MichaelTheTheists</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(2/12/03 12:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Label games.</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;Sadly Michael you are mistaken. Please research the information a little further, you will find that Deism is very clearly not theism.<br>
<br>
If you refer to the basic definitions I posted of these terms, you can clearly see that the ARE similar in that they both start with the premise that God created the universe.  The difference between a theist and a deist is typically their acceptence of, or denial of organized religion.  I reject religion and therefore I could be labeled either a theist or a deist depending on what other kinds of baggage you attempt to attach to these labels.  Either way you look at it, Einstein was NOT an atheist, and resented being used to promote the idea!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Theism is the practice of an organized religion or theology. <br>
<br>
No.  One can be a &quot;theist&quot;, yet not adhere to religious dogma.  I reject religious dogma, but I am a theist.  I use that label rather than &quot;deist&quot; only because &quot;deism&quot; typically embraces the notion that God does not intervene in human affairs.  In that sense Einstein was a deist, but he also clearly did believe in God.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Deism is merely the acknowledgement of a god. No speculation about involvement, or revealed characteristics.<br>
<br>
By that core definition I could also be labeled a &quot;deist&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Go to deism.org or one of the other thorough sites on the subject, or even ask our resident deists.<br>
<br>
It seems others have added their 2 cents already.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What Deism is Michael, is the other side of agnosticism from atheism.<br>
<br>
NO!  That's simply NOT so.  Atheism rejects the notion of a creator.  A deist does not.  They are clearly different core belief systems!  He also resented this kind of double speak as it relates to being equated with atheism!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What Einstein was, as he stated quite clearly and absolutely was not a theist.<br>
<br>
Again, that is not so unless you intend to attach all kinds of additional baggage to the term &quot;theism&quot;.  Theism at it's most basic level is simply the acceptence of a creator.  You CAN attach additional meaning if you like, but then we have a &quot;personal opinion&quot; of what theism means, not a basic definition.  If Einstein rejected atheism and pantheism, and accepted that we have a creator, then he was a &quot;theist&quot; in the broadest sense of the term.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What you in your own misguided little way may be trying to be is a deist. <br>
<br>
No!  I am quite comfortable with the term &quot;theist&quot; even though I typically reject most religious dogma.  In the end, these are simply labels, and the bottom line reality is that both Einstein and I believe(d) in a creator.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I am not trying to insinuate that he was an atheist, I am saying quite clearly and in no uncertain terms that in practical application he acted the same as an atheist<br>
<br>
NO!  That is pattently UNTRUE.  He SOUGHT GOD THOUGH NATURE.  That is functionally different than an atheist who denies his existence entirely!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and that he acknowledged the deist potentials.<br>
<br>
Labels.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;That is equivalent to nontheistic and possibly deistic. <br>
<br>
Labels and rationalizations!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I have no problem accepting that he was not an atheist.<br>
<br>
Yet you keep trying to suggest he was LIKE AN ATHEIST, when he clearly states he resented that being done to his words.  You also assert that his beliefs are &quot;functional the same&quot; as your own, yet clearly he believe in a creator, yet you reject the idea.  Why don't you respect his wishes and honor his memory?  Why do you insist on doing what he resented?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Many fine and otherwise intelligent people aren't. Furthermore &quot;folks like me&quot; are not using him to suggest god doesn't exist, just that he doesn't think YOUR (revealed) god exists. <br>
<br>
Even Einstein stated: &quot;The only source of knowledge is experience&quot;.  Clearly Einstein and I have had different &quot;experiences&quot; of our creator, but his LACK of experience is clearly not a source of knowledge, whereas my POSITIVE experiences of God ARE &quot;knowledge&quot; even by his own definition.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You may note that when I said it, it was in responce to a theist claiming Einstien was a theist as well. If you pray for gods will to be done, ask for his involvement, then you are a theist, not a deist, nor an atheist.<br>
<br>
Now you are attaching ADDITIONAL meanings to these terms that are NOT explicitly stated in the core definitions of these words. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;If you equate god with nature as you say, then why would you pray to a storm cloud or a breeze that it's will be done?<br>
<br>
When did I say I prayed to a storm clouds or the wind?  Nothing like a good strawman fallacy when you're out of rational things to say eh?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;If you believe that god has revealed his wishes to us or has a plan for us, you are a theist, not an deist nor an atheist.<br>
<br>
Again, these are YOUR PERSONAL definitions of these terms, nothing more.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;There is no coffee for me to wake up and smell here, just poor research on your part and an attemt to make what I am saying into something you want to argue about.<br>
<br>
No, there is a core issue here of you using Einstein to support the notion of atheism, and clearly he got ANGRY at that behavior!  Einstein was NOT and atheist, nor functionally like an atheist in any way shape or form.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Einstein was not a theist, deism is not a subset of theism, and you remain, sadly, mistaken. <br>
<br>
It's all a question of what kind of baggage you attach to these words, but what is VERY CLEAR is that Einstein was NOT and atheist and DID believe in God.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Perhaps if you do some research on deism, you will see that in practical application, there is no difference between it and atheism. <br>
<br>
Perhaps if you let go of your PERSONAL definitions of these words, you'd hear me.  I somehow doubt that's going to happen.  In the mean time I suggest you STOP USING EINSTEIN TO PROMOTE atheism, since he clearly DID believe in a creator, and resented the efforts of folks like you attempting to marginalize his beliefs! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/12/03 1:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Label games.</span><hr size=1> <br>
I can see you wish to split hairs and argue the definitions of terms and we will not get anywhere so long as you choose to assign the terms use as somehow my personal perversion of them.  So here then are the entries from Meriam Webster’s dictionary.<br>

<br>
Please note, Deism agrues that god exists and is NOT involved or manipulating the world from day to day.  Theism believes in an immanent or INVOLVED god.  Both start from the premise that god exists, therein lies their similarity from which you try and reason, incorrectly, their interconnection.  Your claim that deism is a sub set of theism stands disproven.  Theism requires an immanent god, one that is involved or has properties we can know or are revealed to us.  Atheism says there is no god, but effectively, there being no god and there being a god who is not involved are substantively the same thing.  Either way, god or not, he isn’t poking his finger into our lives.  You cannot simultaneously call yourself a deist and a theist, they are exclusive terms.  God is either involved and personal or he isn’t.  As Einstein points out, he does not believe in a personal and involved god, therefore he was not a theist <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Qid Erat Demunstratum</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Furthermore, as Kim and I have said, there is no difference in practice between an atheist and a deist as to how they live their lives.  God isn’t going to alter the laws he authored just to meddle in their lives, whether the expectation that god isn’t going to meddle is because he doesn’t exist or just doesn’t meddle are in mechanical application irrelevant.  Same worldly expectation, only the reasons are different.  You keep coming back to the fact that an atheist doesn’t believe in god and a deist does as the difference and it being fundamental.  You are correct, it is the difference, but you are incorrect as to the level of importance attached.  Obviously, were it not for that difference there would be no need to have different terms.  However, ultimately, the worldview remains largely similar.  God isn’t going to shake things up.  Contrast that against theism and you will see where a significant difference arises.<br>
<br>
Agnosticism is the belief that god’s nature and existence cannot be known.  From that starting point, you can look at the evidence and decide that it doesn’t support the existence of god by virtue of its LACK of support for one, or you can argue that the very existence of everything is proof of that god.  If you tend towards the former you fall into the atheist camp, while the latter leads you to deism.  That is how deism and atheism are on either side of agnosticism.  In all three cases, deism, agnosticism and atheism, there is a rejection of religion as it is provided in the dogmatic approach and revealed nature of xianity, judeaism, islam, etc.  The trouble you present is a claim that you experience god or he is revealed to you, and simultaneously rejecting religions.  This could be construed as either confusion or egotism on your part depending on the cause.  Either you are confused and feel that god has touched your life and have not been able to find that right religion for you yet, or you think you know it all and all these religions have it wrong and just you know the nature of god.  I would lean towards the former, confusion, since you argue so passionately and yet without substance.<br>
<br>
One of the limitations to logical reasoning is that you cannot prove a negative.  Consequently, it will never be proven that god doesn’t exist.  It simply cannot be done.  However, once properties are assigned to him, they can be disproven.  For this reason, with respect to religion, I am an atheist.  Each and every property assigned to god by religions breaks down and fails.  For this same reason, with respect to god, I am an agnostic.  You cannot reasonably be otherwise if you base your views in logic and factual truth.  An atheist who insists there is no god and that no amount of proof will sway them is being just as much a fundie as the theist who says there is a god and no amount of disproof will change their minds.  You will find that most of the atheists here acknowledge the potential to change their minds given sufficient proof.<br>
<br>
With respect to Einstein, he never actually came out and called himself a deist.  It would be irresponsible of me to call him one absent some evidence.  He did come out and quite clearly say he was not a theist, did not believe in a personal or involved god and as you point out that he was also not an atheist.  Given all these facts I would reason that he was a deist.  Again, he did not call himself that so I will not, but that is the best fit for what we know of his views.  Either way I am not using Einstein to promote atheism, I am stopping someone who was trying to use him for promoting theism.<br>

Theism believes in an immanent or INVOLVED god. Both start from the premise that god exists, therein lies their similarity from which you try and reason, incorrectly, their interconnection. <br>
<br>
You chose a SPECIFIC definition that suited you.  Woopee!<br>
<br>
Perhaps you can cite me a quote where Einstein resents being used to support the notion of a &quot;CREATOR&quot; as I have provided you with one that demonstrates his anger at being used to support atheism?   Let's see it!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Your claim that deism is a sub set of theism stands disproven. <br>
<br>
No, it's simply YOUR opinion based upon a PARTICULAR definition of these terms.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Theism requires an immanent god,<br>
<br>
Only according to ONE definition of the term.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Atheism says there is no god,<br>
<br>
Which Einstein clearly didn't agree with and resented being associated with.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;but effectively,<br>
<br>
Here's where your rationalization starts!  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;there being no god <br>
<br>
Einstein said there WAS a GOD.  See the difference?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and there being a god who is not involved are substantively the same thing.<br>
<br>
Bzzt!  Wrong!   One ideology suggest that God doesn't exist.  The other suggests God does exist but doesn't get involved in human affairs while on earth.  These are RADICALLY different core beliefs.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Either way, god or not, he isn’t poking his finger into our lives.<br>
<br>
Not here on earth, but that doesnt' mean God doesn't exist.  Surely even you can see that difference?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You cannot simultaneously call yourself a deist and a theist, they are exclusive terms.<br>
<br>
Only by your personal definition.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;God is either involved and personal or he isn’t.<br>
<br>
In my EXPERIENCE he is.  Evidently Einstein didn't have such expereinces.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;As Einstein points out, he does not believe in a personal and involved god, therefore he was not a theist Qid Erat Demunstratum.<br>
<br>
What a great rationalization to take a man's CLEAR statement that he WAS NOT AN ATHEIST, and turn it around to suit your own value system using flawed logic.  Sorry, but that's a BIG TIME rationalization and a logical fallacy.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Furthermore, as Kim and I have said, there is no difference in practice between an atheist and a deist as to how they live their lives.<br>
<br>
One does believe God created the universe.  One accepts the presense of God IN this universe.  The other is in complete denail of God's existence altogether.  They are functionally different and begin with a completely different premise.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;God isn’t going to alter the laws he authored just to meddle in their lives, whether the expectation that god isn’t going to meddle is because he doesn’t exist or just doesn’t meddle are in mechanical application irrelevant. <br>
<br>
It does matter that God exists even were he decide to NEVER change things on earth. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Same worldly expectation, only the reasons are different.<br>
<br>
These REASONS are important however regardless of how you try to rationalize and squirm and twist the facts.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You keep coming back to the fact that an atheist doesn’t believe in god and a deist does as the difference and it being fundamental.<br>
<br>
Yep.  It's certainly a fundamentally different way of looking at the cosmos.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; You are correct, it is the difference, but you are incorrect as to the level of importance attached. <br>
<br>
That is where you try to stuff YOUR PERSONAL OPINION into the discussion.  That COMPLETELY depends on the individual, you don't get to decide that.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Obviously, were it not for that difference there would be no need to have different terms. <br>
<br>
It's a pretty fundamentally different view of reality.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;However, ultimately, the worldview remains largely similar.<br>
<br>
No it isn't!  The deist believes that God exists and created the universe.  The atheist believes no such thing.  I might as well claim that you &quot;functionally&quot; believe in a creator and you aren't really an atheist.  Is that acceptable to you?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;God isn’t going to shake things up.<br>
<br>
Maybe not now, but how about after this life is over?  Are you going to tell me that every deist sees these issues just as an atheist would?  <br>
<br>
Are you a &quot;functional deist&quot;?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Contrast that against theism and you will see where a significant difference arises.<br>
<br>
I see the difference, but you keep glossing right over the differences between a &quot;deist&quot; who believe in a creator and an atheist who does not.  These are not the same belief systems and you know it, you just try and rationalize it away because it irks you to know the most revered scientist of our time believed in a creator and looked for evidence of this creator in the universe around us.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Agnosticism is the belief that god’s nature and existence cannot be known. <br>
<br>
That has nothing to do with this conversation.  Let's stick with the three labels we have going.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The trouble you present is a claim that you experience god or he is revealed to you, and simultaneously rejecting religions. This could be construed as either confusion or egotism on your part depending on the cause.<br>
<br>
You aren't a qualified judge of my life or of my experiences are you?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Either you are confused and feel that god has touched your life and have not been able to find that right religion for you yet, or you think you know it all and all these religions have it wrong and just you know the nature of god.  I would lean towards the former, confusion, since you argue so passionately and yet without substance.<br>
<br>
When did this conversation become about me? <br>
<br>
I can play this game too you know.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the reason you are an &quot;atheist&quot; is because you have an ego problem and are unwilling to submit yourself to a higher power.  Maybe you look at the stars at night and claim &quot;There is no God for I am the greatest intellect in the universe and smarter than 80-90 percent of humanity&quot;.  Isn't this fun? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;One of the limitations to logical reasoning is that you cannot prove a negative. Consequently, it will never be proven that god doesn’t exist. It simply cannot be done.<br>
<br>
Yet you seem to have come to the CONCLUSION that God doesn't exist.  How did you come to that conclusion?  Blind faith?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;However, once properties are assigned to him, they can be disproven. <br>
<br>
Ok, so disprove that this universe has no &quot;creator&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;For this reason, with respect to religion, I am an atheist.<br>
<br>
Do you believe God exists?  If not, what is the basis of your faith in this opinion?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Each and every property assigned to god by religions breaks down and fails.<br>
<br>
Which is why I reject religion.  See how that logic works for me too?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;For this same reason, with respect to god, I am an agnostic.<br>
<br>
Ok<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You cannot reasonably be otherwise if you base your views in logic and factual truth.<br>
<br>
Yes I can.  I can base my belief upon my own life experiences and the expreriences of 80-90 percent of humanity.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;An atheist who insists there is no god and that no amount of proof will sway them is being just as much a fundie as the theist who says there is a god and no amount of disproof will change their minds.<br>
<br>
An atheist doesn't even have the advantage of personal experiences by which to make such a leap of faith either I might add.  Talk about a complete statement of faith!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You will find that most of the atheists here acknowledge the potential to change their minds given sufficient proof.<br>
<br>
In my experience, most atheists are &quot;fundies&quot; too.  I'll post a thread for you on the topic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;With respect to Einstein, he never actually came out and called himself a deist.<br>
<br>
But he did come out and reject atheism by name.  Funny you seem so intent on doing exactly what he claimed to resent.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;It would be irresponsible of me to call him one absent some evidence.<br>
<br>
Yet you claim hes a &quot;functional atheists&quot;???????<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;He did come out and quite clearly say he was not a theist,<br>
<br>
NO!  He came out and said he wasn't an ATHEIST!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;did not believe in a personal or involved god and as you point out that he was also not an atheist.<br>
<br>
Yet you keep associating him with the notion of atheism against his wishes.  Is that your idea of being intellectually honest?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Given all these facts I would reason that he was a deist.<br>
<br>
Here comes your famous rationalizing!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Again, he did not call himself that so I will not, but that is the best fit for what we know of his views. Either way I am not using Einstein to promote atheism, <br>
<br>
You called him a &quot;functional atheist&quot;!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I am stopping someone who was trying to use him for promoting theism.<br>
<br>
You are doing a very poor job of it IMO. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Michael</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(2/12/03 5:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  By your definition Einstein WAS a theist!</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;Main Entry: im·ma·nent <br>

Woopee!<br>
<br>
No, I chose the whole definition that came out on the Webster dictionary site.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Perhaps you can cite me a quote where Einstein resents being used to support the notion of a &quot;CREATOR&quot; as I have provided you with one that demonstrates his anger at being used to support atheism? Let's see it!<br>
<br>
I cannot disprove his belief in a creator, only prove his not being a theist, as has already been done, repeatedly. (see above)  Until you can come to accept the dictionary definitions of words, there is no agreement you will be able to reach here, ever.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;No, it's simply YOUR opinion based upon a PARTICULAR definition of these terms.<br>
<br>
Again, the language barrier.  I went to a dictionary site, I copied the definitions found, how is this my personal definition or opinion?  Do I need a consensus across dictionaries?  websters, scholastics and britannicas? Best 3 out of 5?  How old can these books be?  Is there a minimum readership requirement? What does it take Michael to obtain your blessings on the meaning of a word?  Is it just ‘whatever-mike-says’  and the rest of us be damned?  Awfully convenient for you that my words are somehow selected and screened and yours are all pure and right.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;Theism requires an immanent god,<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Only according to ONE definition of the term.<br>
<br>
Yeah, the English language one.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;Atheism says there is no god,<br>
&gt;&gt; Which Einstein clearly didn't agree with and resented being associated with.<br>
<br>
Point agreed upon…<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Bzzt! Wrong! One ideology suggest that God doesn't exist. The other suggests God does exist but doesn't get involved in human affairs while on earth. These are RADICALLY different core beliefs.<br>
<br>
Not so very radical if you cannot show any effect that they produce.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Either way, god or not, he isn’t poking his finger into our lives.<br>
&gt;&gt; Not here on earth, but that doesnt' mean God doesn't exist. Surely even you can see that difference?<br>
<br>
Yes Michael, I think everyone here can see the difference in believe something exists and not believing something exists.  The point is that it isn’t significant if it doesn’t produce an effect.  A deist functions in act and motive the same as an atheist.  A theist does not.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;You cannot simultaneously call yourself a deist and a theist, they are exclusive terms.<br>
&gt;&gt; Only by your personal definition.<br>
<br>
Yes, and apparently those of Miriam Websters Publishing and other deists as well, but if you disagree, then we all must be wrong, huh?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;God is either involved and personal or he isn’t.<br>
&gt;&gt;In my EXPERIENCE he is. Evidently Einstein didn't have such expereinces.<br>
<br>
OOH, getting personal here Mike, be careful what you lay claim to, we may call you on it later.<br>
 <br>
============================<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;As Einstein points out, he does not believe in a personal and involved god, therefore he was not a theist Qid Erat Demunstratum.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What a great rationalization to take a man's CLEAR statement that he WAS NOT AN ATHEIST, and turn it around to suit your own value system using flawed logic. Sorry, but that's a BIG TIME rationalization and a logical fallacy.<br>
<br>
Please point out where I say Einstein is an atheist?  Is your understanding so limited that you think there is an either/or relationship here?  No other option but theist and atheist?  The False Dichotomy is a logical fallacy, one you are comiting here when you try and imply more to what I say than I really do.  I am saying (for like the 37th time) is that Einstein is not a theist.  Stamp your little feet and insist your definitions are right and we evil atheists are perverting language, but you remain wrong.  Einstein was not a theist.  What I said, and freely repeat, is that he may have been a deist (but he never came out and said he was) and that in practice, the differences between deist and atheist are negligable.  I am not saying they are nonexistent, just not significant.  Then Kim (MightyK) the deist interjected agreement.  SO the atheist agrees with the deist that the differences in practice are insignificant, but the all-wise, all-knowing michael knows so much better than we.  What Einstein describes and everyone quotes here is in total keeping with the practices of deism.  One of us is perverting his words, but it ain’t an atheist doing it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; One does believe God created the universe. One accepts the presense of God IN this universe. The other is in complete denail of God's existence altogether. They are functionally different and begin with a completely different premise.<br>
<br>
(The definition from websters is very long, so I’ll cut to the chase.) Do you agree that a function is “doing” something?  Where then is the action or effect produced in ones life when you think there is no god or you think there is a god but he isn’t doing anything?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; It does matter that God exists even were he decide to NEVER change things on earth. <br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;These REASONS are important however regardless of how you try to rationalize and squirm and twist the facts.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;You keep coming back to the fact that an atheist doesn’t believe in god and a deist does as the difference and it being fundamental.  You are correct, it is the difference, but you are incorrect as to the level of importance attached. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; That is where you try to stuff YOUR PERSONAL OPINION into the discussion. That COMPLETELY depends on the individual, you don't get to decide that.<br>
<br>
Ok, so I agree with the dictionary, a diest comes by and confirms her agreement with what I said, and yet we remain wrong.  It must get lonely being the smartest and rightest human alive mikey.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;However, ultimately, the worldview remains largely similar.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; No it isn't! The deist believes that God exists and created the universe. The atheist believes no such thing. I might as well claim that you &quot;functionally&quot; believe in a creator and you aren't really an atheist. Is that acceptable to you?<br>
<br>
Sure, if you can show me the function part.  As soon as I produce a function that is different between me an a theist (let’s take prayer for example) then there is a difference.  Ooops, you are wrong again, so sorry.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;God isn’t going to shake things up.<br>
&gt;&gt; Maybe not now, but how about after this life is over? Are you going to tell me that every deist sees these issues just as an atheist would? <br>
<br>
I suspect so, but don’t take my word for it, Let’s ask one!  Also, I don’t have any evidence of anything ‘after this life is over’ if you do, please share it with us.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Are you a &quot;functional deist&quot;?<br>
<br>
You could make a good argument for it.  Except I openly declared my atheism and Einstein never declared his deism, just described his views and they happen to thoroughly match those of deists.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I see the difference, but you keep glossing right over the differences between a &quot;deist&quot; who believe in a creator and an atheist who does not. These are not the same belief systems and you know it, you just try and rationalize it away because it irks you to know the most revered scientist of our time believed in a creator and looked for evidence of this creator in the universe around us.<br>
<br>
Actually, he wasn’t a scientist of our time.  He died before my time.  I think Richard Feynman, Carl Sagan and Steven Hawkins are some of the most revered scientists of my time.  It also doesn’t irk me one bit what he believed.  I said before (and judging from your inability to agree on language will no doubt say again) I could care less what he believed, I only care that a theist was trying to advance a propaganda agenda that was unfounded, false and baseless.  There is no difference in the life of an atheist and a deist.  Neither of us choose to behave as we do for fear of gods wrath.  We choose our morals based on common sense not dogmatic edict.  We appreciate the nature and beauty of life on its intrinsic value.  We seek truth that can be empirically seen, tested, reproduced and is quantifiable.  We can quest for answers about life and our universe without fear of it unhinging our views.  We do not pray and expect results, we do not uncertainly question his will or our fates.  God is out of the equation for our decisions.  Period.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Agnosticism is the belief that god’s nature and existence cannot be known. <br>
&gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with this conversation. Let's stick with the three labels we have going.<br>
<br>
Oh, but Mikey, I said earlier a few posts ago that deism was on the other side of  agnosticism from atheism and you said I was wrong, am I not allowed to reply to your refutation?  Do I *HAVE* to stick to the fight you want?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The trouble you present is a claim that you experience god or he is revealed to you, and simultaneously rejecting religions. This could be construed as either confusion or egotism on your part depending on the cause.<br>
&gt;&gt; You aren't a qualified judge of my life or of my experiences are you?<br>
<br>
Sure I am, you brought it up here, I am responding to it.  See what happens when you take a stand?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Either you are confused and feel that god has touched your life and have not been able to find that right religion for you yet, or you think you know it all and all these religions have it wrong and just you know the nature of god. I would lean towards the former, confusion, since you argue so passionately and yet without substance.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; When did this conversation become about me? <br>
<br>
When you started posting your beliefs.  Just trying to understand the rationale behind them since you won’t actually come right out and say them.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I can play this game too you know.<br>
<br>
Mikey, you’ve been playing this game the whole time.  Every time you say ideas ‘rock my world’ or I am ‘disrespecting his memory’ or ‘twisting meanings’ or something is ‘too much for me to handle’.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Perhaps the reason you are an &quot;atheist&quot; is because you have an ego problem and are unwilling to submit yourself to a higher power. Maybe you look at the stars at night and claim &quot;There is no God for I am the greatest intellect in the universe and smarter than 80-90 percent of humanity&quot;. Isn't this fun? <br>
<br>
Funny thing you bring up here Mikey, the smartest man in America happens to be an atheist.  The rate of atheism among geniuses is twice that of average people and 4 times that of below average people.  Maybe you are correct.  I am an atheist, I MUST be the highest order of intelligence on the planet!  No wonder I am unwilling to submit myself to any higher powers!  Well, that and there don’t happen to actually BE any higher powers…<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One of the limitations to logical reasoning is that you cannot prove a negative. Consequently, it will never be proven that god doesn’t exist. It simply cannot be done.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Yet you seem to have come to the CONCLUSION that God doesn't exist. How did you come to that conclusion? Blind faith?<br>
<br>
Nope, no blind faith here, just a total lack of evidence that god exists.  I conclude that unless or until evidence is provided that god exists, I will not waste time with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;However, once properties are assigned to him, they can be disproven. <br>
&gt;&gt;Ok, so disprove that this universe has no &quot;creator&quot;.<br>
<br>
Sure thing, assign a property to it and I will disprove it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;For this reason, with respect to religion, I am an atheist.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Do you believe God exists? If not, what is the basis of your faith in this opinion?<br>
<br>
See above, total lack of evidence.  I don’t believe in something just because I can’t disprove it, I believe in something because the evidence supports it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Each and every property assigned to god by religions breaks down and fails.<br>
&gt;&gt; Which is why I reject religion. See how that logic works for me too?<br>
<br>
Yup, which is also why I suggest you examine deism, as a more rational stance than your current one.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;You cannot reasonably be otherwise if you base your views in logic and factual truth.<br>
&gt;&gt; Yes I can. I can base my belief upon my own life experiences and the expreriences of 80-90 percent of humanity.<br>
<br>
Ah, but then that doesn’t inherently include logic and factual truth, just a diluted form of everyone else’s opinion.  It is a logical fallacy, it is a weak argument, and it doesn’t prove anything.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;An atheist who insists there is no god and that no amount of proof will sway them is being just as much a fundie as the theist who says there is a god and no amount of disproof will change their minds.<br>
&gt;&gt; An atheist doesn't even have the advantage of personal experiences by which to make such a leap of faith either I might add. Talk about a complete statement of faith!<br>
<br>
You are starting from a falsehood so your conclusion is invalid.  Lacking evidence, there is no cause to start from a belief in a god.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;With respect to Einstein, he never actually came out and called himself a deist.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; But he did come out and reject atheism by name. Funny you seem so intent on doing exactly what he claimed to resent.<br>
<br>
Where?  At what point do I say he is an atheist?  I say he functions as would an atheist, but I do not say he is one.  You really seem to have trouble with language here Mikey.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;It would be irresponsible of me to call him one absent some evidence.<br>
&gt;&gt; Yet you claim hes a &quot;functional atheists&quot;???????<br>
<br>
Yes, I did.  He functions no differently than an atheist in practice.  He did not pray, he did not expect god to light up some bush and use is as a public address system, he did not believe anyone was crucified for him or he would burn in hell.  He believed here and now was what we get and that the universe was the highest order of beauty and mystery.  Exactly the same as me and many of my atheist buddies.  Functionally an atheist.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;He did come out and quite clearly say he was not a theist,<br>
&gt;&gt; NO! He came out and said he wasn't an ATHEIST!<br>
<br>
Yes, he said he was not an atheist and he further rejected all the qualities of theism as well as flat out saying his views on religion were being systematicly twisted.  Please review the earlier posts for the quotes.  I started off trying to respond to you in your idiom but it makes for unbearably long posts and the added quotes would only make it worse.  Jeez Mikey, between the two of us, it isn't me that seems morbidly upset at the idea of losing Albert as their theological model.  Why does it &quot;irk&quot; you or &quot;rock your world&quot; so?  Does your worldview totally lose its validation if 90% of the planet and one dead physicist doesn't agree with you?<br>
<br>
There is more of the same drivel in your post but it is a repeat of what has already been responded to so I will spare our lurkers the pain of skipping this over for being even longer than it already is and end your rebuttal here.  I don't think I'll try this way again, what a pain in the ass.<br>
