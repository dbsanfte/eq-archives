Ayashi was tongue-tied...What was he supposed to do now? He knew he and Kokoru had developed some sort of...bond...in the time they knew each other...but this was a bit unexpected...<br>

&quot;Hmm...&quot; She walked a little ways away, next to a bench and sat down.<br>

&quot;what a day...&quot; her headache still there.<br>

<br>
Kokoru looked at them in wonder, blinking, but (for once) decided not to interfere. Instead, he began chasing the pidgeons around him-trying to catch one to eat its soul.<br>
<br>
Ayashi blinked at Kokoru's actions, but turned back at Yukari. &quot;Yukari, just a quick question.

&quot;I don't know... won't Kokoru get hurt if you're in human form?&quot; She looked over at Kokoru... with a strange look on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kokoru don't hurt the poor birds... go hurt a misquito or something.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yukari looked back at Ayashi.<br>
&quot; I dunno what wrong... i do  have a headache though... i need some  tylonal or something.&quot; She remembered what happened last time she said that.<br>
<br>
<br>
**Fina continued from DMC movie theatre**<br>
<br>
Fina sighed as she walked along... not really looking at where she was going. <br>
<br>
&quot;Fina... why do you look sad?&quot; Talon scurried to the top of Fina's red-head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not sad. Just in deep thought. Remember those things we couldn't defeat?&quot; She said, stopping for a moment, unaware of Ayashi and Yukari.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yupyup!!!&quot; Talon's eyes got big and her ears perked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, they wouldn't...they wouldn't perish. It was strange.&quot; She sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;OOOH!!! That guy has WINGS!!!&quot; Talon scurried off of Fina's head and onto AYashi's lap.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hiya mister! You have wings! What's your name?!?!&quot; Talon bounced.<br>
<br>
&quot;AH!&quot; Fina stepped to the side.<br>
A young man with red hair and lavender eyes had just bumped into her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry miss.&quot; He looked at her with a blank expression.<br>

&quot;Well, I thank you a bit for stating the obvious,&quot; said Ayashi, arching an eyebrow - but smiling slightly and his eyes shining. &quot;My name's Ayashi; what would yours be?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kokoru arched an eyebrow at the new arrival of slows ni his close 'proximity'. Needless to say, that took his attention away from the 'feathered rat' and to what was happening around him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ne,&quot; said Kokoru, floating over to Ayashi and Yukari, and looked at the bird, &quot;who's this Ayashi? Some friend of yours from Up There?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ayashi looked at Kokoru, blushed at remembrance from what Yukari had 'relaid' to him from the devil, turned away, the shook his head no. &quot;Not that I know of,&quot; he said. <p>&quot;...Holding on to an unfulfilled wish, I travel high above the lonely sky...&quot; -Tooi Yoake</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 386<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/9/03 7:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Eto!</span><hr size=1> &quot;I'm Talon!!!

<br>
&quot;Yeah...little slow today?&quot; SHe shook her head.<br>

The devil shrugged. &quot;Only one way to find out, ne?&quot; He glided over to Fina and Talon and the Akari. &quot;Hullo,&quot; he said airishly...mysteriously. His long black robes seemed to become transparent, as did his whole body.<br>

<br>
Ayashi still felt the presence, but it was coming clearer to him. It was dark energy, of something that no terran could posses. It was a devil; he could sense it now.<br>
<br>
He grabbed Kokoru's arm. &quot;Kokoru, that power you're feeling is no terran,&quot; he hissed when he reached Yukari and said devil. &quot;It's one of your associates.&quot; <p>&quot;...Holding on to an unfulfilled wish, I travel high above the lonely sky...&quot; -Tooi Yoake</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 389<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/9/03 8:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ih.. nosy little bugger, ne?</span><hr size=1> &quot;I'm sorry.

<br>
&quot;Sorry Kari, can't say i have.&quot; Fina shook her head, eyeing Kokoru.<br>

Kari sighed momentarily then looked back at the two winged ones. They seemed troubled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; He asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;If there is, i can help! heh... having thunder, water, ice, plant, wind, and earth powers really help.&quot; Fina grinned, then winked at Kokoru.<br>

I'm afraid I can't decipher where it's coming from. Sorry, but we mixed you three up with that power; please accept my apologies.&quot; He looked at Kokoru.<br>
<br>
The devil blinked at Ayashi, then sighed. &quot;Yeah yeah, I'm sorry too.. whatever.&quot; He didn't notice Fina's wink, but instead stood up suddenly and took off at the sky, landing on a lamppost--staring at the darkening sky. His wings ruffled in an arch behind him, and the two ravens--Michiru and Rachiru--that were his minions and servants seemed to appear out of nowhere, and landed on his two outstretched palms.<br>
<br>
&quot;This dark power is from a high-devil,&quot; he said to Ayashi below him. <br>
<br>
Ayashi arched an eyebrow at Kokoru's suddenly solemn look. &quot;What's wrong with that? That means they have more control than most of the devils I've met. And it's better for the terrans down here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Haha, very funny White-Wings,&quot; Kokoru snarled. &quot;But that's not a good thing. There are only three High-Devils in Hell. Damien, Lucifer's son, me, and...&quot; his voice trailed off, and his eyes widened. He jumped off the lamppost, and landed next to Ayashi. His breathing quickened, and more shallow. &quot;This isn't good...&quot; he said, and looked at Ayashi. &quot;Guess who it is?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ayashi looked back at Kokoru, and frowned at his expression. It was a mix of anger and another emotion that seemed like worry...and...pain? &quot;It's...her?&quot; Ayashi gulped, and ran a hand through his white hair at Kokoru's nod.<br>
<br>
The two ravens cawed, and all that knew that a raven's caw was bad luck shivered - especially Kokoru.<br>

Fina looked up as she felt a raindrop on her skin. It was beginning to sprinkle... and it was very dark.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to get back to headquarters soon... Leon's prolly waiting for me.&quot; She trailed off.&quot;But there's that really cute guy. Can't pass that oppurtunity up.&quot; <br>

&quot;Oh be quiet.&quot; the redhead glared at her pet.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's right... you are.&quot; Akari chuckled.<br>

He curved his black wings over himself, and continued staring at the sky. &quot;It's raining,&quot; he said. &quot;Sakamae doesn't work well in water..But it's also getting dark, and that she does work well in..&quot;<br>
<br>
Ayashi nodded. &quot;I wonder why she's come...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who knows,&quot; said Kokoru. &quot;But it'll upset the terran calendar if she uses any major powers...it'll upset the movement of the moon and things like that...&quot; <br>
<br>
Suddenly, a large darkness overcame the slowly-dimming sunlight. Just for a split second, though, before a rush of black feathers began pelting the people below.<br>
<br>
The ground and rooftops were literally LITTERED with mounds of black feathers before a dark form began forming in the sky and streaking towards the group of people.<br>
<br>
&quot;There she is,&quot; growled Kokoru, his eyes going narrow.<br>
<br>
The form began to take shape as an..oval..and the group soon learned they were large black, feathery wings covering the buxom figure of the woman behind them.<br>
<br>
The figure landed, and the feathers swept behind her - showing her face - and the feathers that had pelted the ground disappeared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sakamae...&quot; hissed Kokoru. The figure looked at him, and her black hair seemed to be blown by an invisible, yet strong wind, all its own.<br>
