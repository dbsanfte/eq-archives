<br>
Drundam stirred in his grave, his dark ashy handes broke from the freshly placed dirt above him. He slept in that shallow grave every night; it offered the best protection from outsiders. <br>
<br>
His kind had adapted quite well to breathing the small air pockets beneath the dirt, as this was necessary at the depths their colonies where built. However he was an outcast amongst the drow. He had no place in their halls of misery.<br>
<br>
As he climbed from his bed of soft dirt he adjusted his leather pants and brushed the dirt off him. The moon was full, it always seemed full here probably magic of some kind. That gloomy moon, and clear sky reflected off his ashy skin reflecting tints of blue. He seemed to have an almost visible aura.<br>
<br>
Drunam heard the howling in the distance, he hoped tonight wouldn't plague him with night crawlers again. Night crawlers always angered him, long centipede creatures whom spit acid with an exoskeleton that could handle most modern weapons, and their hollow white eyes made a solo drow shiver.<br>
<br>
The howling seemed to get closer he looked about the grave for the rest of his gear. He uncovered a backpack and short sword. The short swords blade shimmered radiant silver, he had stolen it from the corpse in the cemetery just over the hillside.<br>
<br>
He looked in the direction of the howling trying to keep his composure. &quot;Eioi bair!&quot; He uttered a common curse amongst his family. It roughly translated to damn light bringers a term used to describe his Fae cousins who enjoyed the sun.<br>
<br>
It was not a Fae that made the howling, as he could see the creatures outline now. It was a spectre of sorts, probably the dead man wanting his sword back. &quot;Wois Wius&quot; he shouted waving his sword to the left and touching the earth. Quickly a barrier rose between him and the ghost. &quot;Not toneght&quot; he spoke in broken common he had learned from a passing caravan. <br>
<br>
The spectre howled and slammed against the barrier, it's magical properties held the dead creature tightly in a magical cage. Drundam slung the backpack over his arms and carried his short sword in his left hand. He'd buy a sheath for it next time the caravan of tinker gnomes passed through.<br>
<br>
He ran quickly leaving the spectre behind, he was not like most drow and fled from battles he wasn't positive he'd win. That was why he was an outcast, he was pitted against a half-troll in his last colony and fled because no matter how many times he de-limbed the creature it continued to attack him.<br>
<br>
He barely escaped the pit's smooth granite walls just to be bombarded by clubs and curses from the crowd. He was then disowned from the Halls of his homeland. Sent to live above ground. Drundam would regain his place amongst his people, he would see to this, how he was not sure, but death brought glory in many forms.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Drundam stumbled upon a large canister following head first into the dirt. Frustrated he inspected the device it was a bomb of some kind. It looked active so he backed away. He hated the light barer they always deposited unused explosives in his land. Drundam dreamed of having the technology they wielded to return their devil contraptions to disrupt their society, and kill their families.<br>
<br>
He knew they would never understand, the lighter barers hated his people it was a trend nobody from Teir'Dal could escape. &quot;Eoioi Bair!&quot; he shouted into the sky. To loud this time as the ground around him rumbled.<br>
<br>
The dirt shifted and he lost his footing falling on his backside. He quickly scrambled to higher ground gripping tightly to a withered and gnarled tree. It was amazing they grew in such a harsh land but at this time was happy they did. The ground shifted and broke as a large creature stepped above the ground. It's hands alone where larger then his waist, it looked as if it had a large shell on it's back. It's skin was a deep brown and looked like that of a crab but it opened it's mouth letting out a sound that resonated knocking the tree and flinging himself against the hill.<br>
<br>
It stepped forward it's foot landing directly on the canister, the creatures weight which from first glance was more then an elephant set off the device. The device rippted through the creatures leg throwing shrapnel in all directions. A shard lodged itself in Drumdam's arm causing him to yell.<br>
<br>
The creature fell face first several meters from Drumdam green fluid leaked from it's now deformed limb but this did not stop the monster. It crawled forward grasping around Drumdam who was unable to escape despite all of his efforts. He hacked at the creatures arms but it did nothing but scratch what now looked like brown paint.<br>
<br>
The ground seem to spread beneath the two of them and he found himself being scratched by the dirt surface as he was pulled into the sub levels of this world. He tried to keep conscious but this effort alone was to much as he hit his head on stray rocks as the earth split and reformed around them.<br>
<br>
He woke in an empty cavern. Around him was one man and a trial of green liquid that lead to another room. Small creatures no more then a foot high where busy cleaning the surface of the black quartz floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome&quot; said the stranger in perfect common. &quot;My golem was sent to retrieve you and it did. It seems you have damaged it, I'd like to know how? As I have monitored you in the past and did not think your magic was of that caliber.&quot; <br>
<br>
Drundam's common was slow and broken. &quot;it wus nat mei it wus Eioi bair technulagy&quot; The man seemed to be patient and let Drundam complete his sentence. His face was quick to nod with understanding. <br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, we have much to discuss. I am planning something grand, and I need your assistance.&quot; He realized he spoke to quickly for the Drundam no matter they had many months of planning, he would teach Drundam to speak eloquent common. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jarasmine Dranton Lamehstun was the name of Drundams captor. It was an interesting experience being captive because in these halls he had more feedom then he ever experienced. Nobody was trying to eat him, ostracize him or harm him. <br>
<br>
Jarasmine Dranton Lamehstun was a very cordial wizard who specialized in Golem creation. He employed the services of many small creatures who he thought at first glance where imps. Jarasmine corrected him, these where highly skilled worker golems made from the flesh of dwarves and the parts of stray waste canisters. He also housed a large mind flayer colony. How he kept them under control was a mystery, but they fed on the mental energy of any creature stupid enough to wander into their colony.<br>
<br>
The bodies where not of much use to the mind flayers, so they where given freely minus a few stray pieces for mind flayer trinkets to Jarasmine for his golem work. How he had never heard of this man Drundam did not know, as he seemed to have a rather efficient industry of golem creation, wizard training, and the first semi-civilized mind flayer colony he met.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a man of exploration of the body and mind. I have been trying to bring Teir'Dal from its state of chaos into the force so mighty that the other provinces will be forced to offer us respect.&quot; This was the first time his calm demeanor broke, and it only broke in his eyes where Drundam could see the flash of destructive force resonate inside the mans dark blue eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our goals are common, you have become an outcast and you want to be home against amongst your kind, but in order to do this, you must be educated, trained and made a fierce warrior mage to climb the ranks of their hierarchy to the TOP.&quot; The man spoke blasphemy all drow knew a male could never lead the female driven society.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can feel your thoughts Drundam and it is possible and I have the technology to make it happen. We can harness your fledgling skill into a fierce weapon, and by placing you at the head of your drow colony we will be one step further to uniting Teir'Dal and continue where the Dragon of the Void left off.&quot; Jarasmine's voice was full of passion and strength.<br>
<br>
Dundam's silence was consent and the pact was made. The first months Drundam sat in a library with a nymph who's body was beautiful naked, and exposed she too was a creation. She had been enslaved by the drow as a concubine slave, but the caravan owner drifted to deep, and the entire caravan learned the hard way what mind flayers where capable of doing.<br>
<br>
She now had the mind of a scholar and genius intelligence imposed on her reconstructed mind by Jarasmine. She would be Dundam's instructor and she would teach him languages many, many languages. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Two months passed and Drundam quickly learned English, he was even instructed on the rest of his native tongue, deep dwarf, and even that of the frail light barers. His learning rate was increased by a cocktail of drinks given to him by Jarasmine to speed him along. Drundam left the halls of the library leaving the nymph alone again to ponder her creation.<br>
<br>
Walking towards him was Jarasmine down the curved confined path that connected the intricate maze Drundam quickly memorized as home. &quot;So you are ready to learn the higher arts?&quot; Jarasmine knew already Drundam was a fairly decent warrior, and a mage of respectable skill. This was the reason he chose him, but by higher arts he meant skills that would surpass any known drow magician.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm ready for more answers.&quot; Drundam spoke clearly his voice resonating down the hall in a soft baritone. He cold feel the magic in him flow through his new voice and new the cocktails did more then just increase intelligence. &quot;I want answers.&quot; He said again the voice resonating passed Jarasmine who too noticed the subtle command in the voice that pulled at his mind.<br>
<br>
Jarasmine smiled placed his arm around Drundam pleased. He had monitored his progress off and on but overall Jarasmine had been monitoring and preparing for his ultimate goal of uniting Teir'Dal which needed more then just Drundam skills. There where many races and many colonies Drundam was one of many projects of Jarasmine.<br>
<br>
&quot;Walk with me, Drundam I will answer what you ask.&quot; He lead Drundam to an open stadium of sorts that over looked the mind flayer colony. They stood hundreds of feet above the quick footed creatures who's minds could feel the presence of the spies above them.<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you get them under your control?&quot; Asked drundam knowing that control was a strong word, almost insulting to mind flayers.<br>
<br>
&quot;They are not under my control Drundam. They are under my protection. You see I have lived in Menelmacar for many years hidden from the eyes of the leaders until recently. With the immigration of Archetype the mind flayers grew anxious, and feared for their lives, as Archetype is not one to have psion competition, so they grew scared as a few of their less careful brethren spied on the mad man of yellows home. They lost their mind.. painted their rooms yellow.. and could not function.. they starved to death inside their painted homes.&quot; Jarasmine continued to explain.<br>
<br>
&quot;So they fled because Archetype nightly began purging the depths of Teir'Dal of the competition he now had. There only protection was short lasted as the Dragon of the Void rallied them and broke away from Sirithil but this did not last long as Teir'Dal was once again re-united with Menelmacar under now.. Archetypes rule.&quot; Drundam listened intently to Jarasmines words.<br>
<br>
&quot;They stumbled upon my layer and found that Archetype could not find them here. The magical barrier I have around this section of Teir'Dal prevented his scrying eyes, and that of his brethren KinTCR and Pathfollower from viewing us. Archetype has been busy with the internal workings of Menelmacar but they doubt he has forgotten of their presence, so they remain here, as business partners so to speak. They will help us free Teir'Dal Drundam so long as we respect their right to live and feed just as we have a right to live and feed.&quot; Jarasmine looked away from the colony and looked at Drundam that insanity again flashed in Jarasmines dark blue eyes like miniature lightning bolts of psychotic splendor. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm ready to learn the higher arts.&quot; Drundam spoke not as confident as before he asked the question. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Drundam spent an hour each day sitting in a room with a mind flayer. No conversation took place, just the presence of the other was enough to train someones will power. This continued along with his other magical training. This would make him immune to mind control freeing him from any attempt that could be made by Archetype to stop the unification of Teir'Dal. However he would be forced to train long and hard as Jarasmine cautioned him that the Dragon who speaks through the void would lash out if they where not careful.<br>
<br>
All had to be done with precision, he began spending time in the library again too. Just fifteen minutes a day he didn't learn a thing about magical arts in the library, just spent this time relaxing with the Nymph. Fifteen minutes soon became nightly as he spent the night with the insomniac Nymph who lacked a name as Jarasmine rarely named his creation, he did not want them to feel as individuals but as part of a collective.<br>
<br>
Jarasmine noticed the attention Drundam spent inside the library and allowed it to continue. The young man trained hard and never attempted to tamper with the Nymphs mental programming, but simply lay on her lap as she stroked his black hair and slept in the silent library the only noise the page turning of a wandering mind.<br>
<br>
Drundam was forced to learn combat spells, the arcane art was not his favorite skill. Before he had trained in barriers, and invisibility but now that he was Jarasmine's pupil he learned almost constantly the art of destruction. Flame strikes, and explosive force balls. Jarasmine assured him, he would need these skills. <br>
<br>
Three more months where spent in this colony beneath Teir'Dal Drundam was alienated from Jarasmines other projects. He just knew Jarasmine had them and was forced to train, train, and train. <br>
<br>
Drundam stared into the mirror one night. His ash blue skin still radiated slightly but it was fading. He was from a special breed of drow whom where forced to spend time under the moon less their radiant skin fade to deep black. The elders in his tribe let it fade as they did not need to impress the mates, and it was a sign of wisdom to have all black skin. &quot;I will be wise soon enough.&quot; Drundam said to himself staring into the mirror. &quot;I will be the dark force that rises from these depths.&quot; His voice was common, but the passion resonated and he too could see Jarasmine's insanity now flash in his own dark pupils. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Drundam woke in the lap of the nymph. She was massaging his head like she always did gliding her hands across his defined cheek bone, a trait most fae had regardless of breed. He sat up they sat on the libraries intricate carpets. He could only speculate their origin but it wasn't uncommon to raid caravans passing through the wasteland. <br>
<br>
The Nymph spoke saying &quot;Drundam I have found something that may interest you.&quot; Her voice was like a musical instrument that resonated multiple pitchse simulatneously. It was fascinating no doubt most drow would abhor such a creature, he quite enjoyed it. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; Drundam inquired his voice coarse from just waking.<br>
<br>
The nymph slowly moved her hands in the fluid motions her body allowed and lifted a book from behind her. She then gracefully handed it to him. &quot;This.&quot; She said no more instead she crossed her bare legs and lifted another book and began to read.<br>
<br>
He looked at the book in front of him. &quot;The Darkness within Teir'Dal&quot; there was know author and it was the original. He opened it and on the front page was pencil art of a Drow. It looked just like him. He moved away from the Nymph and sat at one of the tables and began reading.<br>
<br>
<br>
And out of the depths of Teir'Dal will rise a young man frail of heart and not hard like other drow. This man will bring forth a revolution of the spirit of the drow.<br>
<br>
He stopped there and flipped through the pages where he viewed the pencil image again on a giant silver throne at the top of blood stained stairs. The authors notes are under the picture.<br>
<br>
He shall slay his own kind shedding their blood for his darkness.<br>
<br>
He set the book down confused, the book slid open slowly and the pages settled. He looked at the text before him.<br>
<br>
And he will be known as Drundam to a few, but Bringer of Darkness to many. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Before Drundam could collect his thoughts the door slammed open. &quot;NYMPH!&quot; bellowed Jarasmine. &quot;You have stolen my journal for the last time.&quot; Then Jarasmine noticed Drundam's presence and the journal in his hands.<br>
<br>
The insanity flashed in Jarasmine's eyes and the journal was ripped from Drundam''s hands flying through the air as if an invisible hand reached and snatched it. Jarasmine's anger did not subside with the recovery of his journal. <br>
<br>
A flash of bluish red beams flew from Jarasmine's hands crashing into the nymph who was thrown across the room. Her frail body hit the floor and a small snap could be heart. The Nymph looked up her nameless face stared at Drundam almost pleading to be saved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait!&quot; Yelled Drundam who launched a volley of short destruction balls that exploded on contact with Jarasmine. Jarasmine was knocked backwards but recovered quickly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Foolish pupil.&quot; The wizard muttered and moved his arms into a gripping motion, steel ropes conjured up around Drundam and quickly constricted him, he fell to the ground with a harsh crack, one robe writhed over Drundam's mouth gagging him.<br>
<br>
Jarasmine looked at the nymph who's face a tear slipped from her eyes. &quot;He should know the truth about his des-&quot; Her voice was cut off as Jarasmine sent an invisible crushing force down upon her with the downward motion of his hand. Her body was lifeless. He glared at Drundam, he said nothing meeting his eyes momentarily and leaving the room.<br>
<br>
The small impish creatures flew into the room gathering the Nymph's body and leaving, she would be recycled, everything was recycled. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Drundam sat there for hours which turned into days he was still constricted by the silver cords. He pissed himself ruining his once pair of leather pants. His mind went from anger, to frustration, to fear, to resolution, to wanting to bring death upon Teir'Dal. He did not know why he hated Teir'Dal but it was the only answer he could think of for his problems.<br>
<br>
Jarasmine entered the room, and waved his hands. &quot;Clean yourself you have been neglecting your training.&quot; Jarasmine's voice was calm, the ropes around Drundam loosened and dissolved leaving an oily substance on his body. Jarasmine exited the room without a word.<br>
<br>
Drundam stood and a small golem began cleaning the substance off the floor, it had crawled in just as quickly as Jarasmine left. <br>
<br>
Drundam went to his room and cleaned himself. His anger and frustration born again as he stared at his bed across from his basin. He'd have to use that bed instead of the lap of the nymph. &quot;Damn that wizard&quot; he thought to himself.<br>
<br>
He was naked and had no clothing he did not care at this point. He left his room his darkening skin showing signs of Drow wisdom. He entered Jarasmines main lab &quot;Explain Wizard.&quot; demanded Drundam.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a mission for you, as you know I am a man of many things. I have been calculating constantly and a caravan is coming. Your job is to destroy it.&quot; Jarasmine did not look up from the book he was writing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why not send a golem to do it?&quot; Asked Drundam curiosly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I already said why. I am a calculating man and it is your duty to do this. Slay every one in the caravan leave one alive. Leave the drow female alive, injure her so she must run. When she runs let her go, and bring the supplies home.&quot; By supplies Drundam knew he ment bodies.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave the north hall chamber, go across the bridge over moon lake. The caravan should be passing within attack range in an hour, now hurry.&quot; Jarasmine looked up momentarily as if to confirm Drundam was hurrying.<br>
<br>
Drundam's heart was heavy but he hurried. He left the wizards chambers almost excited to see the beautiful moon, that would once again restore the radiance to his flesh. The chamber was opened and he entered into a pitch black night. There was no moon, only star cover but stars did not do for his skin what the moon did. &quot;Damn you wizard, always calculating to much.&quot; He was left with the darkness that was his skin, his excited ment dashed again.<br>
<br>
He walked slowly now towards the Caravan's said location. his heart grew worse as he had no desire to kill innocent people. He set foot on the bridge it seemed to barely hold his weight. The wood was rotten in some areas and buckled beneath him forcing him to move quickly across it. The water on both sides of the bridge shimmered like a moon. It was called moon lake for a reason. It was no larger then fifty meters in both directions, hardly worth a bridge.<br>
<br>
There on the other side of the lake he could see it, a caravan with five wagons and riders wrapped in robes and cloth. He could see the drow female on the rear wagon, he did not want to harm these people.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wois Wius!&quot; He shouted into the air moving his hand to the left then touching the dirt. An invisible barrier erected in front of the caravan. Several of the riders stared at him making eye contact.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exwioi wouis&quot; He whispered and his body shimmered momentarily then vanished from view. They where left confused.<br>
<br>
The Caravan came to a halt as the first beast of burden reached the barrier, it would not move any farther. Then a mage from the middle caravan shouted. &quot;It's a barrier! Ambush!&quot;<br>
<br>
The entire caravan took a defensive posture, but Drundam sat effortlessly on a hillside gazing down at them. They formed a circle and armed themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Baysha sherum!&quot; He proclaimed from his perch sending a volley of red spheres at the caravan. They exploded on contact sending a wagon to its side wooden shrapnel skewed the dwarf rider and the rest of the volley hit the ground around them turning up the dirt.<br>
<br>
He became visible only for a moment before the invisibility claimed him again hiding him from there view. None the less a steady volley of projectiles flew in his general direction. He dove quickly behind a boulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fleis far!&quot; He yelled sending a small storm of fire down upon the caravan. It confused the masses who tried to dive out of the way of the falling flames. He charged the caravan drawing his sword his body again faded into invisibility as the spell had not yet worn off. <br>
<br>
&quot;He's amongst us!&quot; Screamed an old hag from one of the caravans. &quot;I can see him!&quot; She pointed her withered finger at one of the shorter dwarves in the crowd. The dwarf was then cut by an invisible force his head falling to the ground.<br>
<br>
From this point on the battle was a rage of mixed horror as his blade met nervous eyes quickly tearing them from their mortality. To once again meet their pagan gods the old hag shouted again and again until she too felt the blade cut across her flesh.<br>
<br>
Drundam's adrenaline settled and he breatheed heavily. Few remained standing, several dwarves and the female drow. His body shimmered and came into view. All three could see each other now. &quot;He's one of my kind.&quot; Announced the angry drow. She charged him with her sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;Baysha sherum!&quot; He yelled causing a red orb to fly from his hands exploding on her chest sending her backwards. She was alive still but unable to stand. The dwarves began to run, he ran after them and overtook their short legs quickly. He kicked their feet from out beneath them causing them to hit the ground face first.<br>
<br>
He did not stab them. &quot;Get up I need your help.&quot; The stood slowly their dark skin was obvious. They where deep dwarves. &quot;Gather the bodies into one caravan and tie one of the live beasts to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The dwarves did as they where told not wishing to meet the fate of their brethren. He walked to the drow who was breathing softly. &quot;Tell the others the outcast spared you.&quot; contempt was in his voice, not like how Jarasmine spared the Nymph though. He would save her just to kill her later he thought.<br>
<br>
He left the drow female and led the dwarvse and the caravan of dead bodies home taking the long path around moon lake. Jarasmine would be pleased he thought. The rage was acted and the blood was spilt. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jarasmine met them at the gate with a crowd of medium sized golems. The golems began unloading the caravan before a word was spoken. Jarasmine raised his voice &quot;I said to kill them all but the female.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My hands can only spill so much blood.&quot; Drundam responded his face had specks of blood from the battle. He made no effort to conceal his disgust, but at the same time he made no effort to show remorse as he had none.<br>
<br>
One of the golems stopped before the beasts of burden who resembled a large ox and bear cross breed. He then looked at the two dwarves then his master Jarasmine. &quot;Yes to the flayers.&quot; Jarasmine added &quot;As a gift from Drundam to them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Drundam tensed slightly he walked away he was going to his room to wash, and lay in his now solitary bed. He would wash away todays event. As he entered his room he poured from a pitcher the golems constantly refilled into the sink. He rinsed the blood from his face and arms. Drundam could almost feel his sins washing away. He looked in the mirror the wisdom visible.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will become the darkness.&quot; He slammed his fist against the mirror the shards cut into his wrist and fell into the red water in the sink. &quot;I will become it, but I will not watch myself become it.&quot; He unplugged the sink letting his sins flow out of the basic leaving only fragments of his image in the glass below him. He walked away dropping his blade beside his bed, he lay there. Alone. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Get up Drundam your glory awaits you.&quot; The drow stirred getting up quickly picking up his sword. &quot;Put on these pants you are naked as when your god created you.&quot; Jarasmine said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Close your eyes if my wisdom shames you, I have come to terms with my darkness.&quot; Drundam stood up from his bed and approached Jarasmine. &quot;What is the task.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;To hear the news, the female drow has reported your victory over their caravan. They suprisingly did not kill her for defeat by an outcast. Instead they have sent several small war parties in search of you. This is glory for a drow is it not?&quot; Jarasmine seemed pleased.<br>
<br>
&quot;Will they not follow my tracks to your northern entrance?&quot; Asked Drundam.<br>
<br>
&quot;No as my golems have created new tracks, using a back entrance that leads directy to the mind flayers feeding pits. They will only increase our strengths. Now to your studies Drundam you must learn more combat related magic&quot; Jarasmine seemed happier then he ever was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Things are going as plan I take it?&quot; Drundam slid his sword beneath his bed, he rarely needed it for magic training.<br>
<br>
Jarasmine handed Drundam a piece of paper. It was a page from the journal. &quot;Read, then return to your studies.&quot; Jarasmine left the room leaving the naked drow to read the page alone.<br>
<br>
He will learn the arts that so many fear, and conquer his own people beneath his rage. It will not be a battle of numbers, but a battle of spirit. There will be no banners waving or trumpets sounding, but a dark spirit without fear of death.<br>
<br>
He went to the mage circle to practice his arts. The black quartz covered the floor and in the center was a drow male tied to pike. There was instructions on the table. &quot;Free him from his radiance.&quot; He looked at the drow closer, it was a member of his own breed. He shimmered.<br>
<br>
&quot;The moon has been kind to you.&quot; Spoke Dundram in perfect common.<br>
<br>
&quot;Te mun has furgatan yu.&quot; Cursed the tied up drow who stumbled on his own words. The curse was only used on out casts meaning they had lost their bloodline. It was respected to be black and old, but not black and young.<br>
<br>
&quot;You fear my wisdom, and for that you will lose your radiance.&quot; Dundram turned the paper over and noticed a spell on the back. He sat on the quartz and memorized it slowly. He could see from his studies a mistake in the spell.. this made him think. What if Jarasmine was not as calculated as he believed.<br>
<br>
Doubts aside he continued to memorize the spell. &quot;Woius diwa iestafen&quot; He could feel the magical energy in him surge and fade. He was close.<br>
<br>
&quot;Te mun fersakin yu!&quot; Screamed the drow on the pike.<br>
<br>
&quot;And the darkness has found me.&quot; Responded Dundram calmly &quot;Woius diwa iestafen liustam&quot; He felt the surge of magic overcome him, and he shook his hand thrust outward arms length then pulled back towards him involuntarily. With that the drow fell silent his head hung over his body.<br>
<br>
Dundram could feel the drow now in him. There was no consciousness but he could feel the life force. The drows body's glow slowly faded to that of a black sage. Never had he seen a drow corpse fade so quickly. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A golem opened the door and tended to the corpse. He was used tot his routine by now. Unlike typical practice where he never used real targets. The body was replaced by a half conscious drow. Who's eyes met his in sorrow. The skin of this drow did not radiat, it was the ash color of all drow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Make it quick.&quot; Responded the drow knowing his sentence.<br>
<br>
Drundam had no anger for this man. He was not of the clan who had expelled him. What was Jarasmine thinking by sending this drow in here. He was bound and had no defense unlike the dwarves earlier today.<br>
<br>
Drundam knew now that there was little use in questioning Jarasmine as his calculations where almost flawless and killing this drow would probably change part of his destiny.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked Drundam.<br>
<br>
&quot;Prince Jan Dahai dark star the 3rd&quot; whispered with still a small ammount of confidence. Drundam knew that killing this drow would cause a war between the two clans. As they always blamed a loss in nobility on the other, and for good reason. Especially when the black ones in his clan would divine the spirits and confirm whom killed who.<br>
<br>
If a war was needed a war was needed. His cautious heart became colder every hour he stayed within the walls of Jarasmine's domain. <br>
<br>
&quot;Woius diwa iestafen liustam&quot; Proclaimed Drundam and again the surge overcame him but he had more conscious control this time and his hand reached out gripping the soul of Prince Jan Dahai Dark Star and pulled it from his physical body, he could feel the life force in him.<br>
<br>
The princes body hung dead on the pike, and like before the golems entered and retrieved it. This time instead of replacing it Jarasmine entered. &quot;Well done Drundam you are now a prince.&quot; Jarasmine's face smirked, laughed and that insanity flickered in his dark blue pupils. &quot;Now I will out fit this lifeless corpse with a new mind, and send it home to do my bidding. They will never expect that their prince will assasinate their queen.&quot; Jarasmine did as he sadi he would, and Drundam watched him do it. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Prince stood up from the operating table. He rubbed his head no scars remained from the operation. Jarasmine was an expert magician but he had his faults. One was his ability to weild a sword.. it did not exist. That was one reason he recruited Drundam, Drundam would make the prefect savior for his cause.<br>
<br>
The Prince stood confused. &quot;Where am I wizard.&quot; Demanded the creation not knowing he was a creation. It had worked perfectly. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are no one, and never will be again.&quot; Spoke Jarasmine waving his hands in front of the drow which entered a deep sleep. &quot;Return him to where we found him.&quot; The large giant golem took him and left the room in haste.<br>
<br>
Drundam was actually amused by the turn of events. Jarasmine could feel it. &quot;Ready yourself, war will be our savior.&quot; Jarasmine spoke leaving the room quickly back to his study to perform more calculations.<br>
<br>
Drundam was confident now and felt completed in his shattered state. &quot;Not our savior, your savior. I have no savior as nothing saves the darkness.&quot; The Drow left the operation chamber and returned to his small room. He sat on his bed he recalled The Nymph and his earlier training days. <br>
<br>
The anger and angst returned to his mind. His frustration was stronger then his magic could express, it would be made to express. Jarasmine's madness, became his madness, which will become his peoples madness. His people he thought not his people. They sent him away he was not worthy. They would pay in blood for his glory. He would be the last of the radiant drow, they turned away the wrong brother this time.<br>
<br>
He slept in his bed his body casted no shadow as it blended perfectly with the darkness. His skin became darker daily or nightly he no longer knew the rotations of this place. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jarasmine opened the door &quot;Wake up Drundam.&quot; but he spoke to the shadow as the drow was not here. The room was empty pure black. Jarasmine flicked his wrist creating an orb of light, there in the corner sat the dark drow huddled in fetal position against the wall. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am awake, more awake then I have ever been.&quot; Drundam stood up the only white now on his body was his eyes. His hair had fallen out in his sleep, leaving his head a smooth black surface. <br>
<br>
Jarasmine was suprised that the transformation was so soon. And the suprise could not be hidden as he stared nervous for the first time at Drundam. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't be so frightened Jarasmine I can feel it, and it feeds me.&quot; Drundam pushed past Jarasmine heading towards Jarasmines study. Jarasmine composed himself quickly following Drundam to his study but as he was going to follow him in Drundam slamned the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Calculate your misfortune I do not wish to be a slave today.&quot; Drundam said with contempt before he let out a howl in the room that sent childs through Jarasmine's body. He could hear his study being trashed by the Dark elf.<br>
<br>
Jarasmine was an adept magician but he had no idea what Drundam had become if he transformed so soon. He could not let his other projects be wasted by this creatures tantrum. He teleported intot he room. &quot;Stop it child.&quot; Demanded the wizard.<br>
<br>
&quot;You stop it, I am blacker then the night sky, I am blacker then any sage and I am still young enough to become a female's companion!&quot; Demanded the dark creature. <br>
<br>
&quot;Drundam do not lose focus, we have goals to meet.&quot; Jarasmine assured him only five more days until Jarasmine would attack.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not call me Drundam as that was once my name but it is hardly suiting.&quot; Drundam's distain was obvious he no longer wished to be called Drundam. &quot;It is appropriate that we call you bringer of darkness, but you are to pale but you brought to where I am. Now I will bring the darkness to their gates and show them true darkness.&quot; He stared at Jarasmine.<br>
<br>
&quot;In five days Bringer of Darkness, five days.&quot; His calculations where perfect.<br>
<br>
&quot;No your calculations have been off before, I will not wait for my eyes to become dark too. I must see to get where I wish to go, and I will go tonight.&quot; The Bringer of darkness responded.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you leave tonight the moon will cause you to glow again and ruin this training.&quot; Jarasmine cautioned him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes but I will travel in the belly of your earth golems and the moon will never set it's orb of light on my flesh again. I will bring my darkness to them.&quot; The conversation was ended as Jarasmine could not refute this idea. He had not considered it as he planned to storm the gates on Teir'Dal's darkest night of the year. <br>
<br>
&quot;I need to calculate this.. &quot; He trailed realizing there was little use in discussing the calculations now, The Bringer of Darkness had made up his mind and it was time to let the darkness unfold across the land of Teir'Dal.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have much to plan.&quot; Jarasmine rushed off coordinating with the many other cursed creatures and projects he was attending too. <br>
<br>
The Bringer of darkness sat cross legged and thought quietly of the silence behind his shadow. There was peace there, and he would bring it to the drow, but he'd first have to envelope them in his shadow before they could experience the silence behind it. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The meditationw as complete and his rage once again flew freely within his veins. He went to his room to pick up his blade. He laughed remembering it's origin and the ghost he trapped inside the barrier. Simpler times, the past was always simple, now things are so damned complicated. He had a time line so he left the room to the golem chambers.<br>
<br>
He walked up to one of the golems and touched it's chest. &quot;You will transport the darkness to my colony's gates but you will not let me leave your chest until the moon is covered by clouds.&quot; The golem was slightly confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;You heard him, let him enter your chest and transport him. I will insure their are clouds tonight.&quot; The voice behind them was Jarasmine. The golem opened his chest to reveal strange contraptions and green liquid that dripped to the ground. The golem removed them to make room for the elf. The Bringer of Darkness entered the chest and the golem sealed him in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quickly now before he runs out of air, and before you break. Once you drop him off return home to be repaired or you will be of no use to use. &quot; Jarasmine told the golem who turned away and entered the earth wall, traveling swiftly without inhibitions through the rocky barrier. <br>
<br>
It came to a crashing stop as the stopping mechanism was not present inside the golem. It caused a deep metal ring to emanate from the black moon gates to the entrance of his colony. The Bringer of Darkness breath was growing short he needed out soon but he waited like the stillness that most shadows endured. He felt as if he was going to black out, and soon he did.<br>
<br>
He woke to the feeling he was falling. The golem had fallen on it's back and a small crack had developed, and like his brethren he still was accustomed to breathing the small air pockets beneath the ground. Years and years of evolution assured these creatures survival.<br>
<br>
He was unsure if it was safe to come out, but he did not care. He would emerge from this cocoon of a bed. He cut open with his blade and stepped out of the Golem, the moon could not be seen it was pitch black. He felt at home and he heard explosions in the distant.<br>
<br>
The wizard had detonated bombs to hide the moon, and he continued to detonate them knowing it would take time for him to enter the gates. Before him stood the guardians of his colony who came to investigate the noise. His eyes now too where almost all black, he could barely see, their skin shimmered like a light house for his blade.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wu ie dier!&quot; Bellowed the leader of the gate guardians<br>
<br>
&quot;The Darkness...&quot; His voice became silent and his body passed through the bars of the gate. It is then he realized he had transformed. He really was bringing the darkness home. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
He passed through the gates his flesh acted like a shadow. He looked behind him and his body was laying inside the Golems chest. But the sword still felt solid in his hand.. what had the magician done to him... he did not have time to reflect.<br>
<br>
The Gaurdians where charging his position lead by his voice. They draw long glowing swords that lit up the area but he did not produce a shadow, he was the shadow now. They charged swinging wildly their blades touched the shadows about him, and he felt their pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Baysha sherum!&quot; He yelled issueing forth a multitude of destructive spheres knocking the first wave back. They did not stop. &quot;Baysha sherum!&quot; He exclaimed again sending even more explosions into the crowd of twenty on coming drows. <br>
<br>
&quot;Fleis far!&quot; He casted the firestorm above them and prepared his blade. This was going to be a long fight. Blade met blade, blade met drow, and blade met the shadows. Every swing at the shadows enraged him as he could feel the shades pain around him and it angered him. He would not die by the hands of these drows, they would be overtaken by his rage.<br>
<br>
He cut through them and moved amongst them like a black mist wielding a glowing short sword that broke the flesh of any drow within reach. The drow fell about him, and the explosions continued to rattle in the background, he needed to make ground before the wizard ran out of munitions.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exwioi wouis&quot; He muttered and his darkness became transparent in the depths of the cavern he moved past them he needed to get deeper. Ten or so of the gate guardian lay dead bleeding at the mouth of the cavern, another ten probed the shadows with their blades. <br>
<br>
He was going to bring the darkness to the depths of this great colony and no one here would stop him. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
He swiftly floated past most of the residence. He passed the main guard posts and now before him stood the grand city that stretched for miles below the ground. All here would face the darkness. The town's edge was met with a large staircase at the top a throne at which the queen sat. He remember the pictures from Jarasmine's journal. <br>
<br>
&quot;Not yet&quot; he thought to himself, they must taste the darkness before they succumb to it. He raised his blade and slew the closest commoner. He then began a rampage cutting anything that moved. The responce was quick as screams spread the guards responded like a hive, it would not be easy. He did not care he was the darkness whom they could not deny.<br>
<br>
As his blade cut down the drow around him he slowly became visible again. <br>
<br>
&quot;Baysha sherum!&quot; He yelled, &quot;Baysha sherum!&quot; he repeated. &quot;Baysha sherum!&quot; he demanded. Each time sending torrents of explosions about him causing the subterranean structures to follow on the commoners and guards alike. The guards continued to attack the shadows, and ever time it weakned him. &quot;You will not stop my rage!&quot; The bringer of darkness cried out his voice resonating like a crisp morning chill.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Woius diwa iestafen liustam!&quot; He yelled at the closest guard, his shadow self lurched like his mortal self once did. The guard fell lifeless, and he felt full. &quot;Woius diwa iestafen liustam!&quot; He repeated this seemed to restore his strength as the guards fell about him. He could feel their spirits join his darkness. &quot;Woius diwa iestafen liustam!&quot; He cried out again causing a guard to stop in mid run his blade flew through the air which The Bringer of darkness side stepped. It skewed a drow that was fleeing.<br>
<br>
It was not woman and children who fled, it was children and men. The females had all the nerves in drow colonies. They would not be so easily defeated and the fleeing drow did not get far, as the darkness surrounded them, cut them, entered them and molested them with it's short blade. Tearing, cutting, ripping at any flesh that was in his view. The silver streets became tarnished by the blood of his brethren.<br>
<br>
&quot;Estam ama kan!&quot; Cried a voice from far away, and then lightning bolts seared from the hands of a drow mage burning at his shadow self. <br>
<br>
&quot;Fleis far!&quot; He responded, &quot;Fleis far!&quot; he demanded and &quot;Fleis far!&quot; he raged. Fire enveloped any flammable structure and confused any near by mage. Children where scorched alive, and The Bringer kept on cutting at his brothers and sisters with his blade.<br>
<br>
They too would find silence in his darkness. His internal peace would be there's once they over came the anguish of his slaying them. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As the battle raged all black drow dead lay about him, their life force ripped from their ash skin. Red blood spilled from those whom died from his blade over the silver streets. The thin cutters which were used to redirect water that filtered down in rain now filtered the blood of his brothers.<br>
<br>
Rats and denizens from below scurried over the corpses drawn to the scene by the smell of fresh death. He continued to get charged by warrior males, the females began sending volleys of lightning at him from behind their battle armor. <br>
<br>
They lightning bolts blinded him as they reflected off the females silver armor and seared through his dark ghostly body.  They passed effortlessly through him, but their magical properties where relentless causing him to groan inside form the anguish of the constant volley.<br>
<br>
He was becoming weak, he would not perish by the females. They gave birth to him, they made him fight in the pits, they made him the outcast. His rage brought new life and new vigor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Estam ama kan!&quot; Cried the females a constant volley of their thunderous powers. The light continued to flash through him. He was numb from the pain, his anger was to strong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Woius diwa iestafen liustam!&quot; Was his only rseponce to their screams. As the first woman fell he watched the glory of birth as they joined him in his darkest womb. They would be his eternal children locked inside his ghastly cloud of darkness.<br>
<br>
He charged the steps the bolts of lightning flying about him, the men no longer pursued him because the volley of lightning was to thick. As he charged the steps screaming &quot;Woius diwa iestafen liustam!&quot; The females before him fell. Instead of stopping to slay them with his sword he charged forward past them, the large trail of darkness that flew like a war banner behind him enveloped them blinding them in his darkness. <br>
<br>
He charged to the throne where the queen was armed with her sword throwing volleys of lightning with her free hand. He did not scream any magical incantations he embraced her like a mother does his child. Her screams where horror as she felt his hands overcome her, she swung wildly with her sword. He was not phased he hugged her with his horrific body tightly his shadowed fog solidifying about her.<br>
<br>
The hug of his blackness turned to a constricting grip the queen fainted in his dark arms she was not dead but asleep at his feet. Before this day they had made him the outcast, now he had made himself one. The outcast king, bringer of darkness he slowly turned about the bolts of lightning had stopped his darkness collected itself about his being.<br>
<br>
The drow breathed heavily, the wounded fought off the rats and carrion crawlers whom tried to eat them alive. The females on the silver steps had their back to him, staring towards the other part of town. There entered a loud thunder as if a large creature was approaching.<br>
<br>
Then from the darkness he had created entered a large crystaline dragon who's skin shimmered but it's transparency gave way to it's creation. Gears where inside of it and upon it's back was Jarasmine. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The dragon roared it's gears releasing steam. Its large feet crushed the dead beneath them. Jarasmine's calm demeanor was present in him again, only moments of insanity flicked in and out of his blue pupils. Jarasmine stepped off his steed sliding to the ground. <br>
<br>
&quot;Unification under one Teir'Dal&quot; Bellowed Jarasmine. &quot;The Bringer of Darkness has forced the drow to listen.&quot; Jarasmine's plan was coming into play. He wanted unification but he could not let the Bringer live in his current state. Jarasmine feared the bringer but he had made preparations and calculated many things.<br>
<br>
Jarasmine looked upward at the large throne shrouded in the presence of the Bringer of darkness. The staircase was littered with the dead princess drow, and the queen at his feet. Some drow remained alive dispersed about the colony there forces still large but there was nothing they could to against the bringer. He was the darkness they had cultivated for years with their dark ways. <br>
<br>
Jarasmine looked to the dragon and nodded. The Large golem's mouth opened and aimed upward at the stalagtite covered ceiling. A large projectile issued forth from the creatures mouth exploding on contact with the ceiling which broke and gave way. Moon light pierced through the crack of the opening shining down on the throne.<br>
<br>
The bringer of darkness revolted and churned inside himself. Jarasmine had sentenced the bringer to slavery once again inside a mortal body. The bringers body solidified and formed once again to that of a drow. His skin began to radiate and the darkness retreat slowly into his eyes.<br>
<br>
Drundam bent over vomiting, the pain of transformation was tremendous. He screamed through heaves his eyes shed tears that did nothing to wash away his sins and shame. He slowly rose above them, he did not whipe his lips. The taste of death was on them and he held down the little acid that was left in his stomach. The tears in his right eye stopped, but his left eye was relentless and coalesced on his chin then fell down across his chest. His tears slowly flowed over the rest of his naked body where they touched that of the fallen queen who slept.<br>
<br>
He was proud for the first time. He had conquered his own people he held with his right arm his sword high. The living drow beneath him screamed in rage and support. Any other race save demons would have been furious.<br>
<br>
This day Drundam had experienced the death of his people, and the glory of his race. He was a moon drow, King of the Moon and would unify the Tears of the drow. <br>
