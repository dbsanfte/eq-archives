Reine took things cooly, he know things about dealing with guards like this. He let the guard see him while he putting on his most authoritative face and spoke calmly but purposely. &quot; I am Reine Medieve 2nd in command of the aronia army, we are here on official business under my authorization. Surely you have heard of my name &quot;<br>
<br>
With ligthning speed, Reine drew one of his twin blade and poised it in the neck of the guard, &quot; Anything that stand in the way of this mission may be eliminated. I can rationalize your death if need be.

<br>
Pops: Surly there can be a non violent solution. *Pops reached into Reine's pocket and took the 100 coins* Here 100 coins for letting us pass.<br>

<br>
Kenyon: This isn't helping!<br>
<br>
Pops: Quiet Kenyon. *Back to the guards* Good sirs, the liklyhood of us surviving the demon horde once we leave is slim to none, so why should we need papers to goto our demise? We will be dead and then you can not be blamed in any way. And if we succeed, we will bring back a way to defeat the demons, and you can be the people who meet us before we started our journey and let us through. You'd be quite popular.<br>

Reine answered indignantly, &quot; As you may know you are under my charge. This expedition was my whole idea, I have fought the demons before. And I do have the authority to pass, they may not be directly in my command but I am a superior to them as to military rank. Had they bothered fighting i would have slit their throat one of them at least since our friend there would have had the other. &quot; Reine gave Thruldor an approving look.<br>
<br>
&quot; I wasn't lying when i said that i can rationalize the killing and I can take its responsibility. I was whom I said I was, second in command of the aronia army, the 4 guards here are under my regimen and the mage too. If you are in doubt of this, then you may leave the group we have a replacement for you anyway, a wizard that one of our companions mentioned.

<br>
Iyiro rose his hand a bit, forming a swirling ring of gray in the middle of his palm.  The smoke formed slowly, and then formed into a mass ring of fire.  Iyiro twisted his hand slightly, and the flame formed a small curl in wind, and he put up his other hand and began to point his finger at it drawing several designs.  After a bit of playing, a few letters in smoke appeared, &quot;Luck is not what you think.&quot;<br>

Reine answered not lifting his eyes from Iyiro &quot; That is why you may be of a liability to the group. Your power is your weakness. What you have done earlier would have cost us all our lives had it been a true encounter with the demons. Tell me  Iyiro, can you control those things if we are to face them?

Iyiro went silent hearing, whether or not he would be able to face the demons.  &quot;I am more than able, I only get the dreams when I least expect, it does not matter on the situation.

Reine granted Iyiro a small space, this would ensure cooperation from him. Iyiro may be a master psionist but he is master of influence, one of the most important traits needed to be a strategist. &quot; I can accept that, in fact I expect everyone to do the same.

The group of 5 circled around, backs to each other, and faught off the demons. Kenyon fell to his knees from fatigue. Pops made a barrier with his magic, and forced the demons back a bit, but pops was too old. His barrier gave way soon after, and the demons resumed their attack. The otehrs tried to help, but their demon foes were not giving them the chance too. Eventually the group of 5 fell, and they were all killed. Pops, Kenyon, Ryngo, Bulkor, and Kenjo were all dead. Now the group was facing 10 demons, and only 8 (Iyiro, Thurdolor, Reine, the 4 guards and 1 mage) of them were left to fight this new threat.* <p>Don't fear that which you do not know I wont hurt you</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goergyboy>Goergyboy</A> at: 10/6/03 6:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=clockworkmist>Clockwork Mist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/6/03 10:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> Iyiro fought his demon till the 5 had died.

Iyiro pressed the button on the end of his grip, and the sword extended into whip form.  He swung it methodically and then lunged it forward to a demon, catching it would be more stupid than sweeping the desert.  Even with steel palms, it would surely leave a nice gash.  But if it weren't blocked it would sending one demon into hell where it belongs.  <br>
<br>
He wasn't sure if this would work, but as a double up, he flung his lashknife free with his other hand and swung it towards a second demon.  Using both weapons like a pirate steers a ship.  Both would deal certain death, or perhaps wound severely. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coolrain@goergyboysroleplayingpalace>coolrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/6/03 6:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://.<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.gamespy.com/avatars/av/MA/ma148" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->[/img]<br>

Reine dodge the attacks of the demons, then moved to make sure of the space between them. Reine called out to his mage, &quot; Haste and slow spell. Others protect him. &quot; Signifying to the mage to cast slow spells to the creatures and haste spells to the adventurers.

Already they claimed 5 and one of them was a wizard. Thruldor, Iyiro, and Reine were each facing off with two demon while the 5 from Reines army fought 4. First Iyiro used his whip like weapon, and the demon caught the whip with his hand. The whip was made of metal, and could severally wound pretty much anything, but the demon hide was unussally strong, and capable to withstand the full force of Iyiro's attack. The demon and Iyiro began a tog o war with the whip, while the lashknife scarred the other demon. Iyiro and the first demon kept up the tug o war, while the other approached Iyiro from behind.<br>
<br>
Thruldor kicked the demon closest, and sent him flying, yet the blow hardly phased the demon. The demon got up and now Thruldor was again facing two demons.<br>
<br>
Reine threw his knives at the demons eyes. Somehow the demon dodged even with the slow spell working against it. It appears all the demons had thicker skin, unnaturally thick and that the slow spell was not working. <br>
<br>
The 5 who were fighting off 4 demons were forced to defend the mage. The 4 demons went straight for the mage of the group. The 4 tried to defend the mage, but their wepons were uncapable of peircing the thick hide of the demons. The demons threw the 4 guards aside, only bruising them, but got to the mage and killed him, taking away the haste advantage the adventurers had. The three adventurers looked ontop of a hill, and saw another figure. He seemed to appear out of nowhere, from 100 feet to 10 feet away in the blink of an eye. The 10 demons regrouped around the figure.*<br>
<br>
Unknown: This is demon land you shall die.<br>
<br>
Reine: Who are you?!<br>
<br>
Unknwon: I'll take that as your last request, my name is Malakye. *The figure was 5'11, and seemed to weigh about 180 pounds. His hair and eyes were both a blood red color. He was armed with daggers, yet seemed a bit young to be feared by these 10 other demons. (if you dont realize it this is Emporertim's character that I brought into play as GM, since he has been &quot;busy&quot;. I think he's just dodging me.*<br>
<br>
*The demon Malakye dissappeared into thin air, or so it seemed. Thruldor pulled out his elven longbow, and shot an arrow that barley missed Malakye.*<br>
<br>
Malakye: So you can see me?<br>
<br>
Thruldor: You make too much noise, any tracker could have found you.<br>
<br>
Malakye: Then enough with these little tricks, ATTACK!<br>
<br>
*The demons began another assult against the now 7 members, while Malakye used his powers to rush the adventurers.* <p>Don't fear that which you do not know I wont hurt you</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=clockworkmist>Clockwork Mist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/7/03 9:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> Iyiro pulled his lashknife back, which would scar the second demon.

<br>
Hearing the sound of footsteps and the smell of rancid behind him, he spun his lashknife around to wrap it around the other demon's neck.  Iyiro grinned as he pressed the button on his handle, and it began to detract on his side so he was pulled swiftly to the demon grabbing the other end.<br>
<br>
He planted his foot into the demons chest, hopefully knocking it off balance and leaving it at the mercy of his whip blade. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coolrain@goergyboysroleplayingpalace>coolrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/7/03 10:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> With, the regrouping of the creatures, Reine took the opportunity to hide himself in the shadows after giving commands to the others to be near enough to him.
