Not much here, she realized. Some tables, a counter, she didn't see many waitresses either. 'Well, Maybe it'll be more comforable here than out in the open...' She looked around and headed for a table, expecting Crow to follow. She looked at a menu... &quot;Well? What do you think you'll want?&quot; She thought she'd just get something small...'I'm just here to talk a little while, that's all.' She noticed some pitiful flowers growing outside the window and wanted to go near them. 'No..Not now! I can't now! If I make something grow or heal, he'll be sure to notice!' She crossed her arms in front of her and acted interested in the menu.<br>

Crow looked around with mild interest.  Quaint.... Not nearly so busy and crowded as a fast food area, but then again one couldn't have it all.  He sat down across from Derla and picked up the stained laminated menu.<br>
...He had barely looked down at it when a voice sprang out in the open again.  Somewhat louder than before.  Even the waitress looked around at their table.<br>
<br>
/The girl looks at the plants./<br>
<br>
Crow buried his face in the menu, peeking once from behind it to stare at Derla.  She had seemed preoccupied with the wilted plants for a while, yes... But at the moment, he was more worried about whether or not she'd notice that strange and smooth vocalled outburst.<br>

She turned back to Crow and wanted to crawl in a hole and die...'My only friend in so long it's not even funny...' She turned back to the flowers and noticed something...Someone was out there staring at her! 'That's... NO NO NO! YOU CAN&quot;T BE HERE!' She got up and turned away from the window for a minute to get up, but when she looked back at the window, the face was gone, but the flowers were moving in the wind, almost dancing...Like they were motioning to her. She sat back and took a few deep breaths. &quot;Well, umm....Waiter? I think I'll just have some water for now, thanks.&quot; She glanced at Crow. 'God, I must look stupid. He Probably wants out of here as fast as he can... Not that I can blame him... This is freaking me out too. That face has only been visible in my nightmares since the night I ran away, the night I spent broken in the ditch, on the side of an old forgotten road...' She looked back a Crow and tryed once more to smile, but only succeeded in a small switch of her mouth. &quot;I get jumpy around loud noises...&quot; she mumbled. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/22/03 1:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm41.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Black Star Cafe</span><hr size=1> <br>

Crow stared at Derla and wondered if she was a little more than uptight.  Something seemed really wrong...<br>
The waiter was looking at both of them with an odd expression (for several various reasons).  Crow needed for him to go away, so he quickly composed himself and asked for a chocolate milkshake, some corn cakes, a slice of apple pie and two cheeseburgers to start.<br>
&quot;You alright?&quot; he asked Derla, as quietly as he could.  He was feeling a bit unsettled. He should have told her about his 3i before.... Then maybe this wouldn't have come as such a shock....  &quot;You wanna tell me about it?&quot;<br>
After this, he was definitely paying for whatever she bought.  It was the least he could do for upsetting her so much...<br>

Crow was still upset, but at least he could explain here and now.  He sighed, thinking this whole episode must be his fault.  He leaned over the table to get Derla's attention, and was nearly distracted again by her eyes.<br>
&quot;Listen... Derla?  That voice was from me, okay?  It was nothing, really... Whatever you heard is nothing.  It comes from this.&quot;<br>
Here Crow pulled back the hair covering his forehead, displaying the golden eye there.  He could feel it opened wide.<br>
&quot;Just ignore it,&quot; he sighed, letting his hair fall into place.  He suddenly realized it probably hadn't made much of a difference since his hair was transperant and the 3i was so bright, but... Well, at least now she knew.  Would she still be so edgy after what he'd done?<br>
<br>
&quot;........Yeah.....I'm really sorry.  I should've warned you...&quot; <br>

Trying to be a little more careful about what he said, Crow looked blankly at the wide arrangement of food spread out on the table, listening to Derla's restrained laughter through his 3i.  &quot;Uh... I ordered this.  You can have some if you want,&quot; he said, not knowing what she found so funny about corn cakes.  <br>
He began wrapping up bits of the food in napkins and sticking them in his trenchcoat pockets.  <br>

<br>
Crow stopped stuffing his pockets and decided to actually eat something.  His instincts were always sharp, but they had traces of the common scavenger in them, too... Picking his meals apart was another habit he was prone to.<br>
While mutilating a corn cake with his fork, Crow mused over Derla's question.  &quot;Worry?  Me?&quot;  He thought some more.  &quot;Oh, I was just afraid that I had upset you in some way.  I mean, you seemed freaked out about the time my 3i- that's what I call that big golden eye there-started talking.  Put one and one together, and I came up with the idea that it might have frightened you or something.&quot;<br>
Crow sucked down the last fo his milkshake, which he hadn't been able to stick in his pocket.  &quot;So, yeah... I really have no problem with myself; not now, anyway.  It's just that people get a little leery about a guy with a talking third eyeball.&quot;<br>
He shrugged, lightly.  &quot;Not that common, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br>
<br>
He tucked the rest of the apple pie into another pocket.  &quot;Well, that's the last of it.  After I-&quot; Crow stressed the word 'I'- &quot;-pay the bill, shall we depart for your Floral Shop?&quot;<br>
He stood and looked at her, with his head cocked to one side again, expectantly.<br>
