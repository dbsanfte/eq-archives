Good question <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't hold to the belief that God forbids us to use birth control.  I know that there are some Christian sects that say that scripture implies that, but I'm just not seeing it.  That being said, I personally don't use any form of birth control.  My reasons are:<br>
<br>
1)  I don't like the idea of putting artificial hormones into my body.  My best friend just got off of Depoprovera (sp?) and she's had nothing but problems with her system adapting without the hormones.<br>
<br>
2)  There is conflicting evidence as to whether or not &quot;the Pill&quot; acts as an abortificient.  Some doctors say that it does, others say that it does not.  If there is the slightest chance that I might harm my baby if I use &quot;the Pill,&quot; then that's a chance I'm not willing to take.<br>
<br>
3)  We tried condoms, but my goodness!  Talk about a mood killer!  Plus, my dh doesn't like the way they feel so it was kind of a distraction.<br>
<br>
4)  We also tried NFP, but found that I'm just not disciplined enough to take my temperature at the same time every morning and all the other stuff that goes along with it.<br>
<br>
So those are my reasons.  But I would never say that we should ban &quot;the Pill&quot; or anything like that.  Like I said, there is conflicting evidence, so I can't say one way or the other about whether it *is* an abortificient or not.  I just prefer not to take that chance, kwim?  But anyways...I have to go finish dinner.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1. It's good for women. Birth control is possible the single most important factor in women's liberation. This is not to say that suffrage and economic power are not, but they would not be fully realized by women without reproductive freedom. The leading cause of death for women until the early 20th century was childbirth, the average woman not only started having children earlier than we do today--she stopped later and was therefore tied to her home and pregnant most of her reproductive life. The implications of this go beyond how healthy it is to have 12 or 14 kids one after another for the mother and/or children (we are much better off today and can ensure better health and more space between children and a mother conceiving only when her body is ready) to the issue of how in the heck a woman can get out there and go to school and work and get daycare and run for congress etc. without control of her own body. The pill in particular had a huuuuuge impact on the women's movement and our ability to exercise these freedoms and newly found powers.<br>
<br>
2. It's good for kids. Like I said in the paragraph above, not being able to use birth control for whatever reason can lead to unhealthy women conceiving which is never good for the kid. If a women doesn't want a child or is in no position to carry one (alcoholic, prostitute, HIV positive) it is particularly important she have the ability to prevent a pregnancy. Mistakes happen and most babies are not planned out that meticulously, but with more and more women waiting until they are educated, financially stable and under a doctor's care to carry a child the ultimate winner is that baby.<br>
<br>
3. It's good for society. When women have more social/economic/political/reproductive freedom, regardless of religion or party, there is more open discussion, benefit to society from the full use of her skills and having a happy, fulfilled, productive woman. This doesn't have to mean a woman not having children at all, rather having how many she wants and can handle when she is ready with the support she needs---they are less likely to go on welfare, be born with handicaps the tax payers foot the bill for or have developmental problems themselves. I could go on and on here but...<br>
<br>
4. It's good for the environment. The extent to which we are depleting our resources, especially in the industrialized countries is just plain nuts and each of our children destroy 10 times more than kids in 3rd world countries. Either way, overpopulation has startling consequences and we best get a handle on this real soon. I remember someone here saying the earth kills of humans every once in a while, but not since the dinosaurs died out has extinction occured on a large enough scale to help and we weren't around yet. There are 6 355 543.4 billion people in the world and number is expected to increase by 50% in the next 50 years!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> The rate at which we consume and degrade natural resources jeopardizes the health of the planet and threatens the availability of clean water for generations to come. Almost one-half of the global population is under the age of 25 (too, too many babies=not adequate access or ability to use birth control), the choices families make today will have a tremendous impact on the future.<br>

I don't think it's an all-out evil, but it's not for me. We use FAM. I don't like Hormones and once I read Taking Charge of Your Fertility, I felt like I had a lot more knowledge and power over my body!<br>
<br>
I don't think people should have children &quot;just because&quot;. Children are a gift and should be welcomed and loved. That's ideal. However, there are times when it's wise to wait. I think it's fine to wait, space, what have you, but I have mixed feelings on the methods out there.  <p>Paige<br>

Haven't been on it since January '98, and won't be going back on it.<br>
<br>
Currently we are going through a bit o' reproductive testing, so we are &quot;not allowed&quot; to get pregnant right now...so if he wants to to do anything, then he knows that he'd better be prepared with his latex collection!<br>
<br>
I actually don't mind them, and he's not complaining either!  Though it is definately easier to not have to worry about such things.<br>
<br>
Here's a kicker - why was it when he wasn't ready for kids, I had to be the responsible one and religiously take my pill every day (even though I was really, REALLY wanting a baby)...and now when it is best for me to NOT get pregnant right now, and it's up to him...I have to constantly remind him!  I hate that!  Do your part would ya!!<br>

After #2 my doctor sent Dh to get snipped.  With 2 kids one newborn and one 3 and all the problems I had and the meds I was on, I couldn't remember to take my BC pill, and 1/2 the time my meds would interfer with the BC making it a waste anyway.  So for my safety, Dh got snipped.<br>

I have decided we are not ready for any permenant form of BC yet so I will be trying them again and hopefully getting a betetr result. I also like the idea of the ( i think this is what it is called) Seasonal?? where you only have a period every 2-3 months.<br>

I guess what really bothers me about the pill and religion is the Catholic Church. My best friend is Catholic and she has three kids (all c-sectioned). After the birth of her third, she found out that her uterus is dangerously thin and if she gets pg again within two years of having #3, she has a high likelyhood of rupturing and dying. She called me a few weeks ago and said that she may have messed up her FAM. Her youngest is only 10 months old. I have highly suggested to her to get on the pill and top talk to her priest about it, but I guess she feels very intimidated talking to him and she lives two hours out from the nearest bishop to talk to him about it. <br>
<br>
I guess for me, I do not see a problem with it. All they would put her on is progestin (she is BF #3 right now) and that would just plug up her cervix so sperm can't get through. Her mom does tend to tell her horror stories about the pill as well (They will give you cancer, they abort the baby, you will not ever be able to get pg again... etc). <br>
<br>

I find very little credible scientific evidence in favor of the abortifacient factor, only theoreticals. As an atheist, I have no philosophical objections, but as a patient who got pregnant while on it, I dislike it because for me, the efficacy wasn't there. As that baby was my first, and she was welcome, it was no big deal, but if I was using it to prevent our family fdrom expanding, I wouldn't rely on it, but that's me, fertile Myrtle that I am.<br>
<br>
I have had 6 pregnancies, and 4 babies, and my pregnancies are all high risk, so with the last baby, we snipped DH, so that we don't have to think about it anymore.<br>

If health wasn't a consideration, I think, like Gaia, I would have babies forever ;-)<br>

I particularly hate to hear people say that &quot;pregnancy is an inconvenience.&quot;  Having your body hijacked for 9 months, followed by the trauma of labor and then your enslavement by a tiny tyrant is more than &quot;inconvenient.&quot; Personally I love babies, but that's just my little quirk and not something I'd feel good about foisting on others.<br>
<br>
I have a friend who is a devout Catholic and tries to follow EVERYTHING Rome asks and believes BC is a serious sin. She suffers from bi-polar disorder and has to take very heavy meds. Let last time she was pregnant, she had to be off those meds and got so depressed she was suicidal. As it happened, the pregnancy was a blighted ovum (no baby) and ended at 14 weeks - which probably saved her life. Now she knows she can't risk getting pregnant again, because she would more than likely commit suicide and leave her 2 children motherless. So she practices BC now. The fact that her faith tells her this is a sin and makes her feel guilty about it is just sick, sick, sick.<br>

<br>
I don't think people should interfer with a woman's right to have or not have babies (this includes abortions as well). Its completely up to the woman. Only she knows how she feels about it, if she is emotionally ready etc etc. <br>
<br>
That said, I'm currently searching for my next bc option. We are using condoms right now because I'm breast feeding. Last time I went right back to the depo shot (I liked it) but I had a difficult time nursing DD, so didn't risk it this time with DS - I really wanted our nursing relationship to work so far I think it is.<br>
<br>
But I hate condoms. They feel funky to me. Ruin the mood big time - and whne you have a baby and a toddler just getting in the mood is hard at times <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Gaia you said you liked the IUD, can you tell me more about it? I'm a horrible pill taker, I'm SICK of the shot, and would just like more options to consider. We aren't ready for a perminate ending of the possibility of children (though I'm closer then dh) but if/when we have a third child, DH is getting snipped if I have to do it to him myself! Also if I reach 35 without having made that decision that in and of itself will be the decision.I don't want children that old. I want to enjoy my midlife sans children like my parents currently are (they go on a cruise twice a year! I can't wait until that's MY TURN) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My family is basically all Catholic. I've a cousin who has 6 children under the age of like 10. I feel so sorry for her. She has HUGE babies and is 5 foot (if that). I mean HUGE babies, like 9 pounds +, that includes her twins! It has to be rough on her. <br>

I have no idea what a fertile sign is. My body has been on hormones or pregnant since...ummm 7 years now I think and the depo shot does stop all periods. And I REALLY don't want to take a chance. You have no idea how much I HATE pregnancy. I was not happy during that 9 months, and I have easy pregnancies! If I wasn't waivering on the third child issue, DH would be snipped as soon as possible <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Have you read Taking Charge of Your Fertility? It talks about fertile signs and how to use it to get pg or avoid it. It was very interesting and i learned a lot. You can go by, um, er, well...your cervical fluid. There is fertile fluid and not fertile fluid. You can also temp daily, but I don't. I learned about luteal phases and all kinds of stuff.
