<br>
Equilibrium<br>
<br>
____________<br>
Jean shivered at embrace.  She hated the cold.  It was the anti-thesis of all that was the Phoenix.  She heard herself sigh with pleasure as fingertips traced wandering lines across her bare stomach.<br>
<br>
It physics.  When two objects, hot and cold, come together they both change.  One cools, and the other warms.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I should hate you,&quot; she whispered even as lips pressed against her neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just a thin line...,&quot; came the response behind her.  They only spoke in whispers.  Whispers were loud as thunder to a telepath.<br>
<br>
&quot;You used him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I use everyone.&quot;   <br>
<br>
&quot;You manipulated me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I let you be what you truly are, what they don't let you be.  What they are afraid of.&quot; <br>
<br>
Jean rolled around atop Emma and straddled her thighs.  Her hands gripped the flawless almost porcelain skin and pinned her wrists above her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, Emma?&quot; The redhead hissed.  Her gaze burning with the eyes of the Phoenix.  &quot;Why all this...I could have just as easily tore your shields to shreds, raped your mind and kill you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I still would have won.  I still would have felt something,&quot; Emma whispered.  A trace of fear and anticipation in her voice.  &quot;Tell me why I'd win this time,&quot; Her voice desperate.  Jean leaned down pressing her thigh against lying women's center.  &quot;You were inside, you know why...&quot; Emma arched her back and gasped at the sensation.  &quot;You know because we made love like only telepaths could...no shields...no barriers...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You didn't need to @#%$ me to know I was the Phoenix,&quot; Jean cursed through gritted teeth.  Her nails raked across chest leaving red lines.  &quot;So many shells, so many layers of ice...You needed Phoenix to see who you really are...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Emma groaned, &quot;I needed to burn.  I needed you, Jean.&quot; Emma said through heavy lidded eyes.    The glint of frost returned to her eyes for an instant.  &quot;Did you like what you saw?&quot; A tease, a tone of cold steel beneath the velvety voice.  Jean sagged allowing herself to fully lay against the women.  A hand stroked stray locks of blond hair from her eyes.<br>
<br>
Beneath the manipulative White Queen, the caring teacher, the wounded women, the broken child...beneath the shields that had grown so protective they were suffocating...<br>
<br>
&quot;Its beautiful,&quot; She whispered hoarsely before taking Emma's lips to hers. <p>_________________<br>

There was someone in her bed, next to her!<br>
<br>
&quot;Wu-ah?&quot; she mumbled, rubbing her face against the cotton pillowcase before lifting up to look down at herself. Draped across her body was a small, slim arm, the hand curled gently over her belly. She blinked twice, craning her neck to look behind herself...<br>
<br>
Into the sleeping face of a tiny, red-haired girl! A rather naked, and familiar, red-haired girl<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohmy...&quot; Rogue whispered, more to herself than for anyone else's benifit. Looking back down at herself, she shifted her legs, and gasped at the wet sensations she felt at her crotch. They hadn't just been sleeping naked... they'd been... the thought hit her like a fist. <br>
<br>
She'd had sex!<br>
<br>
&quot;OhmyGod!&quot; She started to pull away, realizing her own state of undress, but the arm around her tugged her back under the sheets. At the same time, the sleeping girl nuzzled her face against her shoulder, humming in a deep, contented tone as her body fitted like a complimenting puzzle piece against a taut belly and slim thighs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, geez,&quot; Rogue thought to herself. &quot;This... is NOT happening! How in... why is... how did we get like this?&quot; Looking away, she let her gaze drop to the floor of her bedroom... spying the crumpled remains of their clothes, scattered haphazzardly in a trail from the door to her bedside. The memories of the previous night came bubbling back through her foggy mind... the party, the music, as well as someone spiking the punch. She had only managed to make it back to the Mansion without running into any of the instructors or the Professor, because...<br>
<br>
Because... SHE had been waiting for her. Waiting, seemingly in her shadow ever since Rogue had made the choice to join Xavier's X-Men. As punchy as Rogue had been, she remembered enough of her being helped up the back stairs, past the other students - all asleep in their beds - up to her room. There had been a brief discussion, over what she couldn't say, but after that... after that...<br>
<br>
Her thoughts were interupted by another sleepy sigh at her back. The arm around her middle tightened slightly, pressing her back against her unexpected bedmate snuggly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Geez! How is this even possible?&quot; Rogue asked herself. Her powers isolated her from any intimate, skin-on-skin contact... now that she was more awake, the one thought struck her hard. They'd touched last night, and she hadn't absorbed her memories, or her powers! &quot;Ohmy... how is the Prof gonna explain this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;'splain what?&quot;<br>
<br>
She nearly jumped out of her skin at that whispered remark. Snapping her head around, she looked once more at the face belonging to her unlikely bedmate. Only now, her eyes were half-open, staring muzzily into her own.<br>
<br>
&quot;'lo...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um,&quot; Rogue replied with a flush of blush on her cheeks. &quot;Hi...&quot;<br>
<br>
With a soft smile, her partner yawned softly. &quot;What's wrong? Ye seem... upset.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue struggled to find her voice. &quot;I,,, I'm not. Really!&quot; She dropped her eyes down to their naked bodies briefly. &quot;It... It's just, well... I can't explain how you, well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How we're both like this,&quot; her parnter said softly, letting her hand rub over Rogue's belly in a drifting caress. &quot;Is that it, luv?&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue could only nod, the contact of her skin against the touch of her fingers stirring an electric pulse that shook her to the core.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can only tell ye this much... ye were three-sheets tae th' wind last night. Ye started babblin' somethin' about Scott an' Jean, an' then, well...&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue blushed again at that memory: she'd seen Scott and Jean necking in a dark corner, out of sight of the rest of the party-goers. She had wished she was Jean at that moment... even Scott, for that matter, she realized in hindsight.<br>
<br>
Her partner seemed to know what Rogue was thinking. &quot;Ye crave tae have that touch, that feeling... tae be so luved, it dinnae matter whoes touch it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue shifted to stare at her, turning so she lay flat on her back. &quot;How do you-?&quot; She paused, as her companion snuggled closer into her side. &quot;How are you even able to do this? My powers-!&quot;<br>
<br>
One hand drifted up from her waist, as it traced one finger between Rogue's breasts. &quot;I canna say why, f'r certain. Tho... I did discover it during one o' our trainin' sessions.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue blinked. &quot;What? When was this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A few weeks ago,&quot; her bedmate admitted shyly. &quot;Ye were supposed t'be getting Storm's powers, an' ye forgot tae replace yer glove. Everyone was tryin' tae get aboard th' Blackbird, an'... ye pulled me aboard.&quot; Two eyes twinkled with warmth as her hand cupped over Rogue's right breast. &quot;We'd been movin' so fast, it dinnae register tae me, until later.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue tried to ignore the tingling feelings that touch was generating, as she absorbed the words spoken to her. &quot;So... somehow, your immune to my power?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So it would seem, luv.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But... why hasn't the Professor clued in on this?&quot; Rogue's brow knitted with a frown. &quot;I thought he'd know if something like this was possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I dinnae know,&quot; her bedmate shrugged. &quot;But, f'r what it's worth, I'm glad I'm th' one that has this immunity.&quot; She leaned closer, gazing with smoky eyes into Rogue's surprised face. &quot;I've been waitin' since f'rever tae be like this, wi' you.&quot;<br>
<br>
That revelation shocked Rogue - surprisingly, in a pleasurable way - as she stared back at her. &quot;You... have?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye... ever since ye first came tae th' Institute.&quot; Now her bedmate ducked her head as her cheeks colored slightly. &quot;I've been havin'... feelin's, whenever ye've been around.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue had to smile a little at that. &quot;Funny... it's always the shy one's,&quot; she mused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye's not mad at me, are ye?&quot; Her bedmate looked back up at her with wide eyes. &quot;I dinnae mean tae take such advantage of ye... but, when ye started talkin' about Jean an' Scott... an' ye sounded so, so loney...&quot;<br>
<br>
Surprising herself, Rogue reached up and placed a finger across her lips. &quot;Hey, I... I understand.&quot; She looked sideways, smiling softly at the emotions that were coming to the fore at this time. &quot;I mean... I didn't expect this, at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But, that doesn't mean... I'm not, well, opposed to this now,&quot; Rogue admitted sheepishly. &quot;I mean, I did admit I'd have been happy to have either Scoot, or Jean, last night.&quot;<br>
<br>
At that, her partner beamed. &quot;But, ye've got me tho...&quot; She gave Rogue's nipple - which had been growing stone hard with every touch - a firm tweak. &quot;Right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Wincing, yet laughing softly, Rogue reached out and jabbed her fingers into her bedmate's ribs, tickling her in return. &quot;Hey!&quot; she chuckled as they suddenly were embroiled in a mutal tickle-fight; bundling up the sheets as they rolled over and over each other, jockeying for position.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Rogue ended up back on her backside, panting and waving her hands in surrender as her grinning partner straddled her hips, sitting over her with both hands poised to deliver more tickles. &quot;All right, all right, I give! I give!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a triumphant smile, her bedmate lowered herself on top of Rogue, throwing her arms around her shoulders in a warm embrace. &quot;Guid... I've been waitin' tae long t'have ye in my arms, Rogue.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I... I'm happy, I guess,&quot; Rogue admitted. &quot;I'm, not used to being this way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, I understand, luv... If ye'd rather not have me be this way...&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue shook her head. &quot;I didn't say that! I guess... I just need to get used to this,&quot; she said, giving a soft smile. &quot;Though, I don't know how the others are gonna deal with... well, this!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who says they have tae? I was sorta hopin' tae keep this between us,&quot; her partner said, running one hand along Rogue's cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hm, that... might not be a bad idea,&quot; Rogue mused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Does that mean ye's not gonna tell th' Prof about... us?&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue weighed the options silently for a moment or two. &quot;If I told the Processor,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;we'd both be pulled apart, while he and Hank try to figure out how we can touch like this. It might even unlock the key to my powers.&quot; She saw the sudden, crestfallen look on her bedmate's face. &quot;But... I think, having someone I can be close to would be something better,&quot; she grinned.<br>
<br>
At that, the red-head gasped, then swooped into place a kiss on Rogue's lips. Recovering from its suddenness, Rogue returned the liplock with a slow, smoldering passion, wrapping her arms around the naked body of her new-found lover.<br>
<br>
Breaking off, Rogue sighed deeply. &quot;I take it... you like that idea?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, oh aye, I do!&quot; The tiny woman tucked her head under Rogue's chin, hugging her as close as their bodies would allow. &quot;Oh, Rogue... you have made me so happy, luv!&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue felt moisture gather at the corners of her eyes, as she dipped her face to place a loving kiss on her red-tressed head. &quot;I'm glad, Rahne... so, very glad.&quot;<br>
<br>

How do you pronouce her name anyway? Kitty called her Ra-nee and Logan called her Rain. *Confused wolfie*<br>
<br>
*Sidenote - I bet theBizz would find a challenge in doing a Rogue/Rahne pic... what's your take?* I think he said when I mentioned it &quot;Only if I'm in a Furry mood&quot;*<br>
<br>
I wished they gave her a bigger part, I mean, she only had a speaking part once and that was in 'Retreat' and even THEN she didn't sound Scottish! And I still say they only gave her pig tails cuz the artists didn't want her mistaken for a boy. :P<br>

<br>
Stephen: awww, much Rogue/Rahne Evo sweetness!!!!  Lovely, really fun and I *hope* you write more, 'cos I will read it with much happiness.<br>

    My take on Evo Rahne is that she is, indeed, underage...16, tops. Of course, so is *Rogue* in that 'verse, so I wouldn't sweat it.  They are just precocious.  Awwwww.<br>

Morning <br>
<br>
     Ororo woke with the dawn.<br>
<br>
     It was her habit.  Outside, the sky was still dark, not yet tinged with that faint and deep, becoming blue that most people would call morning at its earliest.  She knew better, could feel it in the proud blood and fine strong flesh of her, feel the tilting of the earth, the expectant trembling of the plants, the water, the ground, the sky.  She met it when she could, witness to the waking of the earth, to greet the new sun.  It was a ritual of which she did not tire; Ororo did not often stay long abed.<br>
<br>
     This morning was different.  Memories came to her like sweet raindrops, and she sighed blissfully. Ororo stretched the lithe muscles of her supple arms, the long clean line of her neck, and stilled so as not to wake the other.<br>
<br>
     Brushing the silver fall of her hair from bare, dark shoulders, the mutant Storm looked down at the woman who nestled, still sleeping, in the soft, expansive comforters beside her.  The living warmth of a heartbeat called to her, gently as the sunrise.  Eyes that had begun to take the wild, excited cast of a building storm softened, and her lips curved.<br>
<br>
     Ororo lifted her long fingers and almost touched that sleeping face: almost.  Skin pale as porcelain, hair dark as a rook’s wing, a heavy, gleaming blackness spread wanton across the pillows.  Storm lowered her fingertips to the soft edge, stroked it carefully as she savored the sight of the other.  In all her years of knowing her, Ororo could not remember having seen that hair entirely loosed---always, she kept it in its complex and elegant coif, yet, ever practical creature that she was, she had not cut it.<br>
<br>
    Storm remembered the feel of it beneath her fingertips the night before, as, endlessly patient, she had found the tricks and catches to the style.  At last, Ororo had finally undone it---saw then the flash of defiance, of anxiety in the great cerulean eyes her teammate hid so often, hid behind the uplink glasses, the computerized omniscience of Sage.  Felt the most minute of tremors as she brushed so lightly the high plane of that pale cheek.  Saw the capitulation, visible decision in those deep eyes, the gift of her submission, her trust.  Taking from Sage the teasing scraps of her clothing had been nothing to the initial freeing of that hair.<br>
<br>
     Asleep, she looked both younger and older.  There was not the mask, the chill and uninviting calm that Sage habitually offered to the world:  so trained she was, so controlled and austere that she had learned finally to show nothing, to give nothing, even, perhaps, to feel nothing when it would most protect her.  Trained too well, she had been, and used too harshly.  That perfect mask that let her be the fabulously competent thing she was, that let her deny the deeper pain beneath and so worsened it, was mostly gone when she slept.  Without it, there was an unconscious sweetness to her noble features, something rarely glimpsed that Storm had seen most recently...last night.<br>
<br>
    But there was weariness there as well, the nascent sorrow which she also hid, plain on her vulnerable face as the clean, sharp lines of the tattoos which angled down her cheekbones like the edged groove of tears.  Breath hissed softly between Ororo’s teeth.  She was so beautiful.<br>
<br>
    When had she made the decision, Storm wondered, become aware that she would do this thing, try and break this one’s defenses?  As early as Spain?  Before she had brought together this team, even?  Ororo was not entirely certain; only that, some time after this most recent alien invasion, Bishop had come to her a little uneasily.  “She cares for you, you know,” the big mutant had told her, obviously uncomfortable with the topic but finding it too important to leave alone.  “I never would have guessed, but she does.”  Storm had nodded, and thanked him, and known.  And had not been surprised, not even that Sage had let their teammate see it.<br>
<br>
    The weight and intensity of Ororo’s gaze was too much---Sage’s throat moved minutely, and her shoulders shifted, and then she stilled entirely as her eyes flickered open.  Ororo leaned above her, felt her heartbeat quicken, as for the first time fear touched her like the taste of sleet.<br>
<br>
     Had this been too much, too soon?  Would she run?  Close herself, hide herself away?  On instinct, Sage reached for her glasses, but Ororo had removed them to a higher shelf.  They were left with each other and, locked into Ororo’s gaze, Sage did not know what to say.<br>
<br>
     It was as great a moment between them as the first careful touching of lips, as the heat which had risen mad as the Phoenix from the shreds of that cold and brittle resolve.  Greater: for by the time Storm had led her to this quiet corner bedroom of Rogue’s home, the game had been won, the other’s capitulation obtained.  It had been a long and subtle hunt, through the lengthy evening of dinner and talk, for Storm, looking upon Sage, had made her decision, and Sage, being Sage, had understood this, knew immediately.  But there was a gap, such a gap, between knowledge and meaning.  The living computer they called her, and perhaps there was some truth to it, but Sage was no machine.  She was tender as anyone in the face of possibility.<br>
<br>
     That briefest flash of vulnerability, unsurety, even fear, had taken Ororo’s breath even as the pain in it broke something within her:  for they all bore scars, her team, but none more so or more deeply than Sage, and Sage was not comfortable with what she wanted.  Perhaps, given what she had once been, her place at Hellfire, she was not entirely comfortable wanting anyone.  It had seemed at times almost cruel to press her.  But there had been the sick longing, so brutally quashed, the need she had glimpsed...and more than that.  So, patient, Ororo had pursued.  All of this had been gleaned in whispers of movement, the gesture of a hand on a cup, the tightening of porcelain skin around eyes she hid:  Sage was a subtle woman.  None of the others had even guessed at the dance between them.  <br>
<br>
    Was the tangled mess of Sage, the yawning gulf beneath that cold mask,  something she truly wanted to tackle?  It was a task of such magnitude, and Storm bore her own ghosts.<br>
<br>
      Looking down into those depthless eyes, there was no question, no question at all.  There was something like shock in Sage’s expression, something like disbelief, almost fear.  That she should have let herself know the sweetness that had been, or that she should lose it?<br>
<br>
     Ororo remembered those strong hands upon her body, the small insistent nips tracing the line of her collarbone, lower.  Sage’s tiny gasp as Ororo had reached for her, the fierce and needful passion, the...skill.  Ororo almost blushed, remembering.  And saw the chill distance bleed back into those eyes,  the mechanical quiet return to her still naked body, Tessa retreating to the safety of Sage.<br>
<br>
    “No,” Storm whispered, command more than plea, but both were there as she reached for the other, cupped the delicate point of her chin.  “Don’t.  Don’t be Sage just yet.  Stay with me.”<br>
<br>
     Still she said nothing, and the air itself seemed to hold its breath as emotions that this one professed not to feel flickered across that pale, still face.  Don’t.  Don’t you leave me, don’t you hide.  Ororo felt the seed of a hurricane gather in her eyes.<br>
<br>
     She held her, carefully drew her thumb down the sharp black line of the tattoo, leaned forward and down.  Silver hair caressed the strong, bare shoulders as their lips touched, soft, gentle.  Sage was stiff at first, and Ororo feared that she had lost her, that with the dawn she would leave, could not ultimately bear the intimacy which gave lie to her coldness, would flee forever that thing Storm had seen like a wound in her unfettered eyes.  Felt her give, then, felt the skin shudder and the heartbeat she controlled as thoroughly as any machine increase in tempo despite itself.  Felt the other woman melt suddenly, offer herself to the kiss.<br>
<br>
     When Storm pulled away, the coldness was gone, and Sage’s expression could not be read.<br>
<br>
     “You don’t need to run like that,” Ororo whispered, smoothing the dark and unkempt locks, fighting to keep her voice steady, pierced with a sorrow that anything should have put such shadows in this woman’s eyes.  “I didn’t want you just for the night, you know. I...understand.”  It was too early, far too early to say the word, ‘love.’<br>
<br>
     But Sage was the synthesizer, and the power of that mind was still at work, even now.  Ororo could see the meaning of the words settle, see that Sage saw what was given, the meanings that Ororo did not know yet quite how to frame.<br>
<br>
      She smiled, then, just a little, tentative, almost shy.  The strong and graceful hand rose to Storm’s cheek, brushed across coffee skin.  There was again the boldness to her expression, Sage the indomitable who would give anything, absolutely anything, for her friends and her cause.  Who had already given too much.  Who saw now in the compassion and desire of Ororo that some, at least, saw her as far more than merely a brilliant tool.<br>
<br>
      Storm placed her hand over the other’s and pulled her close.  Sage’s skin against her own was hot and inviting, the pulse like a trapped thing, her giving softness, her trust, unspeakably precious.  Was this woman and what she represented not, ultimately, what Ororo fought so hard for?<br>
<br>
      In the growing half-light of the still and quiet room, they held one another for some time.<br>
<br>
     “It’s getting late,”  Storm murmured finally into the sweet fragrance of her lover’s heavy black hair.  “Outside, the sun will just be touching the garden.  There will be a mist a few hundred feet off the ground, but the light will burn it off, and it will feel wonderful, coming off of us.  From that height, you can see the whole Earth waking.  It will be beautiful.  Will you come with me?”<br>
<br>
     Sage pulled away a little, stared up searchingly into the other’s honest gaze.  At last, she reached up, so lightly to touch her lips against Ororo’s.<br>
<br>
     “I’d like that,” she whispered, her voice a little rough.<br>
<br>
     Storm nodded and rose gracefully, taking the other’s hand, lifted her from the bed.  For a moment, they stared at one another, and Ororo smiled suddenly, bright and hopeful.  Sage’s eyes, her tiny smile, gave it reflection, and carefully, she took Ororo’s hand, let the taller woman lead her into the garden.  Together, they padded out to meet the coming day.<br>
<br>
