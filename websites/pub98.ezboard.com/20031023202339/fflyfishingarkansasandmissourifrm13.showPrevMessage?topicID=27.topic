He found some errors in my cast pretty early on. Of course Andrew totally waxed me in the distance casting. It's tough getting to be an old man. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One of the things I discovered was that I was gripping the rod too firmly in the back cast. this was introducing a considerable amount of &quot;bounce&quot; in my rod tip and thus opening my loop. We had a bit of a cross wind so it was difficult to throw &quot;tight&quot; loops but still it was a very productive day. <br>
<br>
Casting on a warm day with a cross wind is a little different anyway. It didn't slow Drew down too much. I'd be curious what he could do at altitude where they hold some of those casting contests. I know that while I'm in Denver at some of these shows I can carry probably 10 to 15 feet more line than I can at sea level. We wren't throwing any shooting heads or anything fancy. We were just casting plain old 5 weight fly rods with a big indicator on them for a fly. I think Drew could post some &quot;stellar&quot; distances at a higher elevation.<br>
<br>
I'd tell you guys what the tape measure said but you'd think I was lying if I told you Drew's distance, so I won't even go there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In short, the conditions were not suited to work on precision but I don't think I have had as much &quot;fun&quot; watching two people cast as I have watching John and Andrew.<br>
<br>
John is a strong caster who can hit 100 plus feet with a 5wt--now think about that, how many flycasters can hit 100 plus feet with a 5wt, especially in less than ideal conditions.  Further, watching John casting for accuracy, in a wind, let's you know that he is a very accomplished and more importantly dedicated caster.<br>
<br>
Andrew, well what can I say.  This was the first time that I have seen Andrew cast and he is exceptionally powerful.  Andrew consistently hit 130 plus feet (one as around 136') with an 8wt.<br>
<br>
  When we were serious and working on 5wt distance Andrew was consistenly hitting distances over 110' and several approaching the 115, 116 area, again in less than ideal conditions.  Casting over 100' consistenly with a 5wt is very, very difficult and when a caster reaches this level he/she has accomplished something.  Andrew has simply far surpassed that level.<br>
<br>
I look forward to the three of us getting together again.<br>
<br>

<br>
Andrew and I shot a show in February on the White. Drew was casting my &quot;8&quot; foot 5 weight down in front of Gaston's lodge on the river. We were doing all sorts of spey stuff and just general hanging out. Andrew shot well over 20 feet of backing out the tip of that 5 weight Trilogy. The line was definately slicker in those cool conditions but it was tilll far from &quot;ideal&quot;. We were on the river and in waders. Of course it was impossible to &quot;measure&quot; but I'm sure it was in excess of the distances we were casting yesterday. Plus it was an &quot;8 foot&quot; rod.<br>
<br>
I'd like to compare the differences between my 10 foot 7wt GLX and your 9 foot, Chuck. I'll bring it with me to the conclave. <br>

I tell you one thing for sure...those rods are SWEET!  Chuck, after playing with your 8wt CrossCurrent, I have found a replacement my 8wt XP.  That rod had a great feel up close and seemed to cast itself.   I would like to fish that 4wt you had John.  That would be an AWESOME fishing rod.  I would bet the 5wt would be pretty sweet as well.

<br>
That type of rod is the one I'm trying to get us for the competition. I'm also trying in the 10 foot. Talk about a sweet nymph rod. The distance rod is pretty sweet though. You could fling a wooly bugger half way across the White River with that rod. With a shooting head and a 12 weight you'd put that thing into lower orbit.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I'm still working on that project. We shot a show in February that we did quite a bit of &quot;real&quot; casting with fishing gear on, wind blowing, etc. I'm trying to get some of the footage into a digital format so that I can load it on the web. We'll be doing some footage specifically at the conclave for that purpose. I can still email you some footage of Andrew casting if you are intersted although the files are pretty large. Most of the time I'm the one doing the filming. I wish I would ahve gotten Drew throwing the 8 foot Trilogy this winter though. Geesh.....<br>
