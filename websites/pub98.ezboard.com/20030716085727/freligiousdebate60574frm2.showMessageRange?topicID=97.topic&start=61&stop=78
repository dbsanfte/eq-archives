<br>
&gt;&gt;How many times mikey?<br>
<br>
Any kind of scientific fact would do there denial boy.  I not particularly picky about how you support your faith, just that you actually do.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;How many do we have to tell you? What is so hard that you cannot wrap your little mind around this? I am giving up the disingenius idea about you and starting to think you may jst be rock stupid. <br>
<br>
Ah, more insults.  You are utterly pathetic.  How old did you say you were?  12?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Nonexistance cannot be proven. It can NEVER be proven. EXISTANCE must be proven.<br>
<br>
I has been &quot;proven&quot; to the public at large via experiencial reality.  I cannot be obligated to convince everyone.  Science itself is built upon fact and consensus.  You've offered me NO facts and you views represent a TINY minority of the human experience.  What then have you got but thin air to support your faith?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; That is the only way it works, no matter how much you seem to think differently.<br>
<br>
I don't think differently and I've supported my &quot;beliefs&quot; whereas you have not.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; The only way to prove that something does not exist is to know everything in existance,<br>
<br>
You mean like you pretend to know what created the universe?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and further know that what you are claiming doesn't exists is not one of those things. That will never happen. It is not possible.<br>
<br>
Then just embrace your &quot;faith&quot; in the matter and quit whining about it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You cannot prove there are no flying reindeer, invisible purple carp or pink unicorns. <br>
<br>
But these don't have the acceptence of 80-90% of the humans on earth.  God does.  Wanna guess why?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You CAN say the evidence does not support their existance. Aside from your fluid interpretations of what god is or may be or others think (talk about rationaliztions on your part) everyone does not believe in the same things. God is not love in Satanism.<br>
<br>
Satanism isn't a religion of God, it's a denial of God.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; There you go. You asked for one, you got one, now shut up already. <br>
<br>
You didn't provide me any support that a religion that honors God believes that God is not loving.  So shut up.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You are the one claiming something exists,<br>
<br>
Ya, me and 5.5 billion other human beings.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;so the burden of proof is on you. <br>
<br>
Which is why I provided you evidence to support my views.  Note that I am not obligated to MAKE you accept this evidence as truth, but then you've provided me nothing and then foolishly try to suggest your right.  How would you know?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Show me this god of yours mike.<br>
<br>
Meditate denial boy.  Try a wee bit of humility why you are at it, because if you treat God as you have treated me, you'll just wallow in your own ignorance for all time.<br>
<br>
&gt; You try and try and try to make the same tired and failing case. <br>
<br>
That is your &quot;opinion&quot; born of blind faith.  It is not &quot;scientific fact&quot;, nor does it represent 80-90% consensus of the planet.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I do not have to disprove gods existance,<br>
<br>
If you wish to deny God's existence you'll have to provide us with BETTER explainations for creation, NDE's, past life memories, and the overwhelming majority of personal experience of God that humans experience.  If you don't, then you're just whistling dixie.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I get to disprove your arguments for his existance (of which there are none so far aside from the 3 fallacies you abuse, argument from authority, fallacy of numbers, and revisionism.)<br>
<br>
Sorry, but your &quot;opinions&quot; here are born of pure ignorance and blind faith.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Show me the fossil of an angel.<br>
<br>
Eh?  Did I say anything about angels living within physical reality?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Give us gods thumbprint,<br>
<br>
Give me a neutrino on a platter.  How about an atomic structure?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;find the point in the equation where a mathamatician writes 'here a miracle happened' or the step in the big bang cosmology where a god explains better than physics what we think happened.<br>
<br>
You've never even bothered to explain what YOU think happened other than some lame idea about this &quot;singularity&quot; that blows for no apparent reason when there is no time and no change.  It's a logical impossibility.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You can even start by simply proving the logical fallacy I am hiding behind. <br>
<br>
Besides the one that suggests that differences in beliefs about God's character disproves the existence of God?  How about the one that suggests pure skepticism defines reality?  Do you need more?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Prove that the lack of evidence for something is cause for its existance.<br>
<br>
Prove that a lack of evidence disproves something.  If 200 years ago you'd have tried to demonstrate radiation,  and could not, by your definition, it didn't exist.  BZZT!  Logical fallacy!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;(and enough with the whiney cry baby attitude about the personal attacks, like any of us care. <br>
<br>
I'm simply amazed (YOU mainly) this group thinks personal attacks are useful in a debate.  I'm amazed that this childishness is so prevelent in every single one of your posts as though that's a valid arguement.  It's utterly and totally pathetic.  Grow up.<br>

<br>
Which is infinitely better than providing us nothing but a statement of faith.  Do you intend to offer me any explanation of how the universe got here, or shall I just assume you haven't got one to offer and live purely on blind faith?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;He called for us to prove a negative AGAIN,<br>
<br>
You've never demonstrated it's a negative to begin with.  Can you explain how the universe was created?  Yes or no?  If you cannot, then your opinions can only be a statement of faith.  PERIOD!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;used the claim that since most folks believe in god then it must be true at least 7 times (ad populum is it?),<br>
<br>
NO, it's scientific fact.   Thats the kind of evidence that scientists use to form opinions about topics.  <br>
<br>
You might now constrast that with you utter silence on the idea of what created the universe, what consciousness is, what life is, what causes NDE's, why people have past life experiences, etc.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; refused to elaborate on the experience he claims as proof of god saying that we don't need to know about it, <br>
<br>
You have no need to know what my experiences of God have been, and frankly I don't feel like throwing my pearls before swine.  All I need do is explain I have these experiences and demonstrate that others have personal experiences of God as well.  The exact nature of these MANY experiences is utterly irrelevant to the arguement being presented.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;even though he keeps saying that we cannot dismiss it without knowing the details..<br>
<br>
Yet you do it anyway.  HMMM.   <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;hmmm anyone else getting dizzy? Wow--I loved the response to using straw men being that DBC uses them too (no proof offered of course, just ironic) and the denial that he has ever said we are not open-minded and have not researched or investigated any of his beliefs.....then two sentences later going into another boo-hoo, whiny lament that he bets we've never even looked into NDE bulletin boards and don't even read or study this stuff. <br>
<br>
You clearly have not done any of these things, nor can you offer us a better explanation for these events.  Instead you hide behind a statement of faith and a couple of logical fallacies and act like that's &quot;scientific&quot;.  BZZT!<br>

Sure. Most people are raised with religion and taught that to question it makes them arrogant, egotistical, evil and that there will be horrible consequences for leaving it including being ostracized from social groups, family, friends, work associates and worse, perhaps eternal damnation. It doesn’t help that memes are still operating in favor of mysticism or tendency toward religion. None of this proves god is real. <br>
In other words Michael, it doesn't matter why 80-90% of the world's population believe anything---the thing must be proven on it's own merits regardless of popularity. This is why the National Enquirer is not taken as serious news despite the fact it is the #1 paper. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Satanism isn't a religion of God, it's a denial of God.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

Wrong—it is a recognized religion and you can find out more about it right here on the web or any library. See Anton Levy for a start. P.S. denial of your god and religion are not mutually exclusive.<br>

Wrong again. NDE’s have been explained here, but it is not necessary to explain these or reincarnation or any other tenet or specific religious sects when debating the existence of god itself. <br>

If you wish to take the high road here and point fingers I highly suggest you refrain from such jejune remarks when making doing it. It’s like telling someone to stop f*&amp;^uing cursing all the F@#$%% time!! So next time you want to address “denial boy” while he “wallows in his ignorance for all time” at age 12, think about what color your own pot is.<br>
You can “call things as [you] see them” without telling us how boring, stupid and pathetic we are, or go for insults and jabs when you can get them in. I actually like a smart ass, if he's smart too and can articulate and defend his position.<br>
<br>
Quit whining and make a choice. Want to take the gloves off or stop calling people names while telling then to grow up? <br>

<br>
You keep confusing &quot;belief&quot; with &quot;experience&quot;.  Why?  If I experience love, and most folks experience love then it's pretty fair to say that love exists and is &quot;real&quot;.  You keep suggesting these &quot;experiences&quot; don't matter only because a &quot;few&quot; have not had them.  Then by your definition, consciousness and love cannot exist.  See the problem yet?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;So Michael if 70-80% of the world changed their minds tomorrow and stopped believing in god, would he cease to exist?<br>
<br>
No, nor would they.  These &quot;opinions&quot; are born of experience and one doesn't change their mind that they've never experienced love or consciousness before.<br>
<br>
M&gt;But these don't have the acceptence of 80-90% of the humans on earth. God does. Wanna guess why?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Sure. Most people are raised with religion and taught that to question it makes them arrogant, egotistical, evil and that there will be horrible consequences for leaving it including being ostracized from social groups, family, friends, work associates and worse, perhaps eternal damnation. It doesn’t help that memes are still operating in favor of mysticism or tendency toward religion. None of this proves god is real. <br>
<br>
Yet folks like me rejected all this, embraced atheism for 9 years in my case and still ultimately changed their opinions after experiencing God.  See the problem yet?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;In other words Michael, it doesn't matter why 80-90% of the world's population believe anything<br>
<br>
Bzzzt!  It most certainly DOES matter.  I believe in love because I have experienced it myself.  I believe consciousness is real because I have experienced that myself as well.  I believe God is real because I have experienced God for myself.  Now you can deny these things lack empirical data, but that doesn't make them &quot;unreal&quot; or non-existent.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;---the thing must be proven on it's own merits regardless of popularity.<br>
<br>
Prove love or consciousness is &quot;real&quot; based upon this line of thinking.<br>
<br>
M&gt;Satanism isn't a religion of God, it's a denial of God.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Wrong—it is a recognized religion and you can find out more about it right here on the web or any library.<br>
<br>
If it's a &quot;religion&quot;, it's a religion based entirely on the absense of God in one's life and has nothing to do with honoring God.  <br>
<br>
M&gt;If you wish to deny God's existence you'll have to provide us with BETTER explainations for creation, NDE's, past life memories, and the overwhelming majority of personal experience of God that humans experience. If you don't, then you're just whistling Dixie.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Wrong again. NDE’s have been explained here,<br>
<br>
No, they've been inadequately rationalized here.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;but it is not necessary to explain these or reincarnation or any other tenet or specific religious sects when debating the existence of god itself. <br>
<br>
Yes it is if you wish to deny the existence of God.  If you can't explain how we got here or what causes these things then your &quot;opinions&quot; on these matters can only be seen as a statement of faith.<br>
<br>
M&gt;I'm simply amazed (YOU mainly) this group thinks personal attacks are useful in a debate. I'm amazed that this childishness is so prevelent in every single one of your posts as though that's a valid arguement. It's utterly and totally pathetic. Grow up.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;If you wish to take the high road here and point fingers I highly suggest you refrain from such jejune remarks when making doing it. It’s like telling someone to stop f*&amp;^uing cursing all the F@#$%% time!! So next time you want to address “denial boy” while he “wallows in his ignorance for all time” at age 12, think about what color your own pot is.<br>
<br>
Hey, if you guys intend to dish it out, I never claimed I'd take the high road forever.  Be prepared to get back what you dish out.  It's called karma.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You can “call things as [you] see them” without telling us how boring, stupid and pathetic we are, or go for insults and jabs when you can get them in. I actually like a smart ass, if he's smart too and can articulate and defend his position.<br>
<br>
If you expect me to sit here and take this kind of personal abuse forever, you have another think comming.  It's called payback.  If you intend to sling mud, don't whine to me when I sling it back.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Quit whining and make a choice. Want to take the gloves off or stop calling people names while telling then to grow up? <br>
<br>
I'll play by your childish, moronic and pathetic rules for a while I must, but my hope is you get the message and clean up your act.  If not, don't blame me when your insults get returned to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=powertotherae>Powertotherae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Satan's Lil' Minion</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/16/03 4:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=97.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: You keep confusing &quot;experience&quot; with belief.</span><hr size=1> You might have already told us but I missed it if you did.

Is consciousness real?</span><hr size=1> M&gt;If I experience love, and most folks experience love then it's pretty fair to say that love exists and is &quot;real&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Wrong--see Debate 101 thread, lesson #1.<br>
<br>
I see no point in doing this topic in several threads.  Here is fine.<br>
<br>
Are you suggesting then that love does not exist, and consciousness does not exist because these things cannot be empirically demonstrated?  What value is there in these human &quot;experiences&quot; as it relates to &quot;consensus&quot;?<br>
<br>
M&gt;You keep suggesting these &quot;experiences&quot; don't matter only because a &quot;few&quot; have not had them.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;No, I have never rejected these on the basis of numbers.<br>
<br>
I'm talking about EXPERIENCES, repeateability and verifyability not numbers.  If I experience love and I can repeat the experience, and I can see evidence of these same experiences in others, isn't it fair to assume that love is &quot;real' and exists?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;To the contrary, I have stated on several occassions that I do not refute your numbers of those who claim to believe in god or have mystical experiences.<br>
<br>
How do you know your opinion is valid?  Pure faith?   Are you trying to project your own lack of an experience on everyone?  Isn't that like claiming if you can't read, nobody can read?  If you can't surf, is that evidence that nobody can surf?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I DO say the experiences of NDE, transubstantiation, reincarnation, visions, etc. are separate from the issue of whether there is a god in the first place and that numbers are not proof. <br>
<br>
This then becomes your &quot;opinion&quot; and cannot be considered &quot;fact&quot; any more than I can suggest my beliefs are &quot;fact&quot;.  We then need to look for some kind of consensus, and you'll need to substanciate your views too.  So far, you've offered me nothing to substanciate your faith.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Again, I refer you to the Ad Populum fallacy explanation in the above mentioned thread.<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with Ad Populum.  This is about EXPERIENCE, and validating these EXPERIENCES in others.  I EXPERIENCE love.  I cannot emprically demonstrate it or put it in a jar for you.  My EXPERIENCE however is repeatable, and I can find evidence that others have a similar if not identical experience of love as well.  When then do we draw the line and accept &quot;experience&quot; as evidence that something is &quot;real&quot;? Is love real?  Is consciousness real? Can you empirically demonstrate either of these things?<br>
<br>
M&gt;No, nor would they. These &quot;opinions&quot; are born of experience and one doesn't change their mind that they've never experienced love or consciousness before.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;This doesn't answer the question. If you believe that whatever 80% of the planet believes in must be real, then you must also concede that if they cease to believe this or change their beliefs, then reality also changes. <br>
<br>
Actually, even if only a FEW folks experienced the presense of God, you could not entirely rule it out.  You could SUGGEST that the evidence doesn't support the case if the numbers were low enough, but it would be premature to conclude that NOBODY really experienced such things.<br>
<br>
The fact SO MANY people do experience love and consciousness and God would suggest that these phenomenon are &quot;real&quot; and they exist.<br>
<br>
M&gt;Yet folks like me rejected all this, embraced atheism for 9 years in my case and still ultimately changed their opinions after experiencing God. See the problem yet?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;No, and saying you were once an athiest and changed your mind is another fallacy. The problem is your inability to refute any of my arguments.<br>
<br>
Huh?  I'm simply conveying the idea that your explanation does not account for ALL theistic belief, nor can you use such an explanation to support your views.  I have refuted your arguements quite well IMO, and your arguements are frankly not based upon evidence of your own, just rationalizations for the evidence I have presented.  This is much like a creationist offering no proof at all that the world is really 10K years old.  Instead they argue about every real piece of evidence that is presented and then suggest this &quot;inability to refute their arguements&quot; is proof that they are correct.  It doesn't work that way.  <br>
<br>
M&gt;Now you can deny these things lack empirical data, but that doesn't make them &quot;unreal&quot; or non-existent.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Right. I never claimed that my personal experience was proof one way or the other. In fact, both DBC and I have said we CANNOT prove a negative and never once mentioned our personal experiences. Now you're getting it...<br>
<br>
No, you aren't getting it.  Just because you personally lack such experience is not evidence that nobody experiences God.  I experience God.  I would expect if this is a &quot;real&quot; phenomenon that others would also have such experiences.  I know from talking with many friends that this is so.  I also need to confirm that more than just my own little circle of friends have such experiences, and I can see evidence of this in the overwhelming number of theists there are among the human population compared to the number of atheists.  Pure (hard) atheists represent less than 5% of the total human population in fact.<br>
<br>
M&gt;Prove love or consciousness is &quot;real&quot; based upon this line of thinking.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I did this in another thread and you chose to ignore it. I won't repeat myself.<br>
<br>
You didn' &quot;prove&quot; any such thing in another thread.  You alleged it, you insisted it, but you didn't demonstrate it emprically.  Shall I assume you cannot demonstrate these things to be real either and that therefore they must not exist?<br>
<br>
M&gt;If it's a &quot;religion&quot;, it's a religion based entirely on the absense of God in one's life and has nothing to do with honoring God.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;So you concede it is a religion,<br>
<br>
No, I said &quot;if&quot;.  I've never even met a self proclaim &quot;satanist&quot; before, and the only thing I've seen on TV about such folks would suggest it's a form of atheims, not deity worship.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;just not one honoring your version of god? <br>
<br>
Just not honoring God at all.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Have you attended the Church of Set, read Levy's Satanic bible and known Satanists?<br>
<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; If not, I recommend checking this out since you enjoy personal contact with believers in the systems you are investigating. You do this for reincarnation and NDE, why not Satanists?<br>
<br>
Do you have a link that would demonstrate that a satanist is actually worshiping a deity as apposed to simply being an atheist?<br>
<br>

&gt;&gt;Wow--all this talk about reincarnation had led me to the false assumption you were familiar with Eastern belief systems. Look up kharma again on the web before you misuse the term again.<br>
<br>
You wouldn't know a thing about the idea.  Have you actually studied Vedic traditions, or shall I assume you are blowing more smoke?<br>
<br>

Is consciousness real?</span><hr size=1> Alright, if it's too much trouble for you to go to a fallacy link or read the thread that details why ad populum is weak and fallacious I will post it here for you..<br>
<br>
Appeal to Popularity (Ad Populum) <br>
Classification: A deductive fallacy of soundness with a falsehood in the major premiss, in the Ad Vericundiam family. <br>
<br>
Description: The argument supports a position by appealing to the shared opinion of a large group of people - the majority, the general public, etc. The presumed authority comes solely from the size, not the credentials, of the group cited.<br>
Discussion: <br>
<br>
<br>
Truth is not democratic. One person can reason as well as a hundred, and a hundred people can be just as wrong as one. A position is not necessarily true merely because it is held by a lot of people, nor is a position necessarily false merely because it is held by only a few. When Einstein was advocating pacifism, a group of fellow scientists tried to counter his influence by stating their opposition to pacifism. They published a collection of essays titled One Hundred Scientists Against Einstein. When Einstein heard the title, he remarked, &quot;If I were wrong, one would have been enough.&quot;<br>
However, the Ad Populum fallacy certainly has a powerful psychological effect - sometimes known as the &quot;bandwagon effect.&quot; And there are good reasons for this…<br>
<br>
The Ad Populum fallacy exploits the public nature of reasoning. However, the fallacy confuses the distinction between a popular (and often unthinking) acceptance of a particular conclusion with a public acknowledgment of the principles by which conclusions should be reached. Sometimes the fallacy is even used to draw conclusions about matters that really are just matters of personal taste (e.g. which soft drink you should prefer), thus confusing the public nature of reasoning with private questions of taste.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
So you see Michael the reason that NOONE HERE EVER rejected your scientific data that 80-90% of the world is religious, is that it proves nothing about whether god exists—only that most people believe he does. <br>
<br>
Love is an emotion and we can prove that we have chemical changes in our bodies when we encounter certain people or experiences that give us pleasure and we can also trace actual real actions taken by those who claim to love toward those they claim to love. I see no proof from you that god has done anything or that he even exists and as has been pointed out several times, 5 or 10 or even 20 billion humans or aliens can believe something, but this does not make it true.<br>
<br>
Please reread this post several times and visit fallacy links to understand why the bandwagon is being rejected. You might ask for help from some fellow theists at other debate boards as well who are more competent with logic and debate.<br>

What is love mikey? It is a feeling.  Do feelings exist?  I can define them and describe them and catalog representative characteristics of them and their expression.  Why pick just one feeling there mieky?  Is it because you think god is love and if we prove love we prove god?  Chemical changes, pheremones and attraction do not a creator make.  Your implication is that because I cannot wiegh it on a plate it must therefore not exist.  This is circular reasoning and yet another in your litany of logical fallacies.  You use the idea in the definition and then cite the definition as validation of the idea.  Some instances of this would be something like gravity.  What is gravity?  The force of attraction between two objects. Circular.  Yet we can measure gravity, experiment and reproduce quantifiable, measurable, repeatable results.  So that tautology is not the ONLY thing to describe it, just the only linguistic mechanism.  You idea of god however IS the ONLY thing you have.  What is a photon mikey?  We cannot see one or weigh one or put it on a plate, but we can certainly see its effects, measure its actions and reproduce the results.  Still don't get it?  Of course not...<br>

Oh please.  Don't even attempt to whip out some dime store redention of the vedic traditions on me.  Your grasp of these concepts is clearly infantile.  Do yourself a favor and actually read a book once in a while.  Just out of curiousity, what books on vedic traditions have you actually read?  Don't dodge that question, answer it honestly.  I'd like a list. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

&gt;&gt;Her karma from this life won'ty bite her until next life there Vedic boy. <br>
<br>
Denial boy, your comprehension of these topics is so rediculace, it's amazing you even have the gaul to put your foot in your mouth like this.  Karma comes back around to bite one all the time.  It needn't follow you into another life, it can affect you in this one.  Your infantile grasp of these issues is utterly appauling.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;(BTW - yer wrong, I am only 11 and I still kicked yer arse,  HAHAHAHAHHAHA  Tell me about pathetic again Mikey!)<br>
<br>
You are indeed a legend in your own mind I see denial boy.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

&gt;&gt;Main Entry: tau·tol·o·gy <br>
<br>
You need to read something more than a dictionary once in a while.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What is love mikey?<br>
<br>
I don't know denial boy, you tell me.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;It is a feeling. Do feelings exist?<br>
<br>
I experience them.  Do you?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I can define them and describe them and catalog representative characteristics of them and their expression.<br>
<br>
And I can define God in this way as well.  Your point?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Why pick just one feeling there mieky?<br>
<br>
One seemed to be enough there denial boy.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Is it because you think god is love and if we prove love we prove god?<br>
<br>
No, I was noting that whatever &quot;evidence&quot; you might cite to demonstrate the &quot;realness&quot; of such an experience, would also apply to ones sprituality as well.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Chemical changes, pheremones and attraction do not a creator make. <br>
<br>
Chemical reactions don't explain feelings or consciousness denial boy.  Is a battery conscious?  Does my portable computer have feelings?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Your implication is that because I cannot wiegh it on a plate it must therefore not exist.<br>
<br>
That seems to be your implication about the experience of God.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;This is circular reasoning and yet another in your litany of logical fallacies.<br>
<br>
You've not demonstrated the realness of love or consciousness.  There's no fallacy in noting that.  It's simply fact.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You use the idea in the definition and then cite the definition as validation of the idea.<br>
<br>
Huh?  No, you simply jumped to some of your famous irrational conclusions.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Some instances of this would be something like gravity. What is gravity?<br>
<br>
Er. what does that have to do with demonstrating love?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The force of attraction between two objects. Circular. Yet we can measure gravity, experiment and reproduce quantifiable, measurable, repeatable results. <br>
<br>
How does one measure love or consciousness?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;So that tautology is not the ONLY thing to describe it, just the only linguistic mechanism. You idea of god however IS the ONLY thing you have. <br>
<br>
No.  I experience God, just as I experience love and consciousness.  So do the vast majority of human beings.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What is a photon mikey?<br>
<br>
That has nothing to do with what I asked you denial boy.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;We cannot see one or weigh one or put it on a plate, but we can certainly see its effects, measure its actions and reproduce the results. Still don't get it? Of course not...<br>
<br>
It's you that don't get it Einstein.  You can see the affect of love and consciousness, but you can't possibly measure these things.  You experience them as I experience God, but any rational arguement you can use to describe love I can use to describe the presense of God.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Once again mikey, you have been DENIED!<br>
<br>
Once again denial boy, you used your favorite tricks to avoid the topic and jumped to irrational conclusions.  Having fun?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Heheh, denial boy denies mike his victory. Ooooh the irony.<br>
<br>
Denial boy is soooooo out to lunch he can't even follow a simple conversation.  I guess at your age that's to be expected. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 256<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/16/03 9:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=97.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Your dime store rendition of vedic traditions is laughab</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Denial boy, your comprehension of these topics is so rediculace<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

as is your grasp of the english language and spelling apparently. Perhaps you should pick up a dictionary once in a while and while you're at it a book on debate and logic so you can actually refute something rather than just ask for lists of books read.<br>

Classification: A deductive fallacy of soundness with a falsehood in the major premiss, in the Ad Vericundiam family. <br>
<br>
How many times do I have to tell you that this arguement has NOTHING to do with &quot;Ad Populum&quot; arguements.  I'm simply validating my OWN EXPERIENCES with the statistics.  Get it yet?  <br>
<br>
There is no rational way to know with certainty what I experienced is valid unless it can be corroborated with others.  Not only can I do that by talking with friends and family about their experiences of God, but I can look at the whole statistical data and find ample scientific evidence to support these experiences.  <br>
<br>
You on the other hand are projecting your own LACK of experience upon the whole human race.  When however you attempt to verify such a concept, you run smack into the contradiction that MOST folks DO experience the presence of God in their lives, even if you do not.  <br>
<br>
Now do you understand?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Truth is not democratic.<br>
<br>
But your IGNORANCE of this experience is not indicative of the human experience.  We can see that in the statistics.  Now you can whine and complain that this doesn't mean with absolute certainty that I'm right, but it surely looks that way based on the numbers, and science is all about building a consensus.<br>
<br>
I'm going to skip most of the rest of your post since it's a rehash of what I've already commented on.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;So you see Michael the reason that NOONE HERE EVER rejected your scientific data that 80-90% of the world is religious, is that it proves nothing about whether god exists—only that most people believe he does. <br>
<br>
It does prove that I share these experiences with MOST human beings.  I can validate my experiences in this way.  How do you validate your opinions which are clearly born of blind and self imposed ignorance and are not shared by the VAST majority of human beings?  Blind faith perhaps?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Love is an emotion and we can prove that we have chemical changes in our bodies when we encounter certain people or experiences that give us pleasure and we can also trace actual real actions taken by those who claim to love toward those they claim to love.<br>
<br>
We can do exactly the same thing with spiritual experiences as well.  We can see changes in brain activity as well.  You are ultimately describing the AFFECTS OF these experiences, not the experience itself.  That same logic can be used to validate the experience of the presense of God.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I see no proof from you that god has done anything or that he even exists and as has been pointed out several times, 5 or 10 or even 20 billion humans or aliens can believe something, but this does not make it true.<br>
<br>
Nor does your denial of the commonality of this experience across the ENTIRE human population make it so.  I speak from a place of knowledge based upon experience.  I can validate such experiences in others.  You speak from a place of utter ignorance and when you look externally for validation, you run smack into statistics that suggest otherwise.  See the problem with your brand of faith here yet?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Please reread this post several times and visit fallacy links to understand why the bandwagon is being rejected.<br>
<br>
Ditto, but skip the links since this is about EXPERIENCE and validation of EXPERIENCE.  It's not about an appeal to numbers, it's about finding validation of our OPINIONS in the world around us.  I can validate my experiences with the experiences of the vast majority of others.  You cannot.  What does that tell you?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You might ask for help from some fellow theists at other debate boards as well who are more competent with logic and debate.<br>
<br>
You might lay off the insults for a couple of posts and maybe we can find a place of mutual acceptence and understanding.  Perhaps you aren't interested in that, but frankly this childishness is old and tiring and of no value in an honest discussion.  I'm willing to tone things down.

We can't even agree on the definitions of words like god, supernatural and experience. Dictionary definitions just get you riled up until you call for us to &quot;put down our dictionaries&quot; and pick up your books on kharma and mysticism. In fact, you do not even agree this is a debate that must follow the rules of logic and continue to violate them. When there is common ground and terms are agreed upon, debate and discussion happens (check even the other ez debate boards to see what this looks like). You refuse to do any of this.<br>

Yet you continue to post with the same, fallacious arguments and totally incoherent ramblings consisting of fragments, phrases and disjointed arguments. I agree there is no value here since you have provided nothing of value to think about. We already knew most people believe in god, that some claim to have NDEs, that many are pushing intelligent design creationism and that lots of folks have &quot;experiences&quot; they feel brought them to their beliefs. None of these prove god.<br>
