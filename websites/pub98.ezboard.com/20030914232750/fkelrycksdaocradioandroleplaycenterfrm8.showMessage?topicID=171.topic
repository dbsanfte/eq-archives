If you've ever wondered why she's so fond of 'keens...well this will explain it! Hope you all enjoy her story...as much as I did writing it! **********************************************<br>
<br>
[b]Roxxie, Celt among the Lurikeens[/b] <br>
<br>
The two boys laughed making Roxxie frown and walk away. [i]How could her father put her in a training area full of bozo's[/i], She wondered. [i]What was it that was so funny?[/i] She went to sit under a nearby tree while her fingers played with the tall grass. [i]How much longer could this season's training be?[/i], she questioned. <br>
<br>
Out of her peripheral vision she saw a pair of cloth boots slowly coming around the back of the tree. She turned her back to the shoes, knowing they belonged to one of the boys who were laughing at her. A sigh came from the boy behind her as he knelt down just arms length away. &quot;We didn't mean to poke fun.&quot;, he started. &quot;Honestly we thought you were joking. You are joking, aren't you?&quot;, the voice tried to sooth. <br>
<br>
She turned her head, just so, as to see a young elf with blue hair. &quot;Why would you think I was joking?&quot; she inquired. <br>
<br>
The elf cocked his head to the side and a small half grin graced his perky lips. &quot;Well, I mean...um...well,&quot; he stammered obviously trying to say just the right words, &quot;I suppose we thought you were joking 'cause you are quite visibly a Celt!&quot; At this she frowned and turned her head again. <br>
<br>
&quot;I know what I LOOK like, silly elf...but it's not what I AM!&quot; The conviction in her voice startled the elf and he leaned in towards her, &quot;Oh? And and so you really think you're a ...a...&quot; <br>
<br>
She faced him now, her hazel eyes dead set on his, &quot;yes I AM a lurikeen!&quot; She could tell he was trying to contain his amusement. She sighed and turned her head once more. <br>
<br>
&quot;Look, I am sorry, but it confuses me why you would think yourself a 'keen. I mean you are nearly 3 times as tall as a 'keen, no large round eyes of a 'keen, no pointed ears of a 'keen, and no...&quot; <br>
<br>
She interrupted him again, annoyance thick in her voice, &quot;I know I know...&quot; <br>
<br>
He now sat a bit closer to her and tried to reach out and touch her hand that was still playing with the grass. She pulled away and sighed heavily. &quot;Um...,&quot; he began again, &quot;let's start over...okay?&quot; ,he inquired softly. &quot;My name is Jesp and I come from just near Innis Carthidge.&quot; He pointed over to a blonde haired boy with a silly grin on his face looking over at them, &quot;My friend over there is Nitle. And what shall we call you?&quot; <br>
<br>
She looked over at the elf, into his curious yellow eyes, &quot;I am Roxxie. The nearest town to my house is Connla.&quot; <br>
<br>
Jesp smiled wide, &quot;we live just a few towns over from each other!&quot; <br>
<br>
She rolled her eyes saying, &quot;yah...just a feeew.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Well, hmmmm...lets see...what else can I tell you about myself?&quot; He thought a moment then continued, &quot;I have ambitions to be an enchanter!&quot; At this Roxxie giggled, which made the blue-haired elf smile even broader. &quot;You laugh?&quot;, he beckoned her response. <br>
<br>
She nodded and glanced over towards him, &quot;only because you need .... um ... practice at being enchanting.&quot; <br>
<br>
Jesp laughed and nodded in agreement. &quot;Yes well, you have me there Roxxie.&quot; <br>
<br>
Exhaling hard she turned to sit facing him. She spied him hard and said, &quot;you wanna know about me then I suppose?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Only if you are willing to share it,&quot; Jesp replied. <br>
<br>
She thought a moment and nodded, &quot;Well, I'm sure you'll find this just as funny, but I find the path of a warden very intriguing to me.&quot; His grin didn't fade but his eyes twinkled in acknowledgement and encouragement. &quot;And my folks are both lurikeens and I have 10 lurikeen siblings,&quot; she blurted out almost begrudgingly. <br>
<br>
At this his eyebrow's raised, &quot;Ony 10 'keen sisters and brothers? For a 'Keen family that is a small number!&quot; She smiled and nodded. <br>
<br>
&quot;So...&quot;, his brow furrowed again trying to find the right words. <br>
<br>
&quot;Soooo, how did a couple of Lurikeens have a Celt child?&quot;, she finished for him. He nodded, his eyes full of curiosity. &quot;Well, I could tell you it was a miracle,&quot; she winked now jesting with him, &quot;but I suppose the truth is what you are seeking.&quot; She pursed her lips thinking, then began, &quot;My father...my lurikeen father was making his way back through Mount Collory when he said he found me. He doesn't know how I got there, but that I must've slipped past the guards while they were switching patrols. No one really knows. I was about 2 years old he figured as I was walking and could say a few words.&quot; Jesp's yellow eyes flickered in interest. &quot;Well, my father thought I was just lost and inquired the guards for who my folks could be. No one knew. Heck, they were surprised I was even there!&quot; She giggled, &quot;father says since he found me the switching of the patrols has been much tighter!&quot; She winked at Jesp making his perky elf lips open up in a wide grin. &quot;So anyway, father stayed at Drum Legion for a week looking for my folks as best he could. Although, he never did find anyone who knew anything about me or who my folks were. There is even a notice he left with Glasny about me and where I could be found should anyone come looking for me....&quot; She sighed, &quot;although, no one ever has.&quot; She paused, a smile parting her lips as she continued, &quot;So father took me home. He and mother raised me as their youngest and kept me as such. I suppose keeping a celt child fed and clothed was a daunting task for them. But they never showed it and always made me feel as if I wasn't any different than any of my older siblings. I was just...hmmm...height advantaged, a bigger eater, and the only kid in the whole brood with curly red hair.&quot; She chuckled and peered over at Jesp who was now sitting with his back against the tree. <br>
<br>
&quot;So...&quot; he began, &quot;you are a Lurikeen.&quot; They smiled at each other and she nodded. &quot;Why are you at this school then? I mean I've never seen you before now.&quot; His question seemed earnest enough and she felt comfortable telling him. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am here now because my folks could no longer teach me at home. My father is a mentalist and my mother, well, she's always stayed home and took care of us kids; though she was quite good at poultices and herbal healings and such. She noticed I was very good at assissting her when father came home to mend from the wars or adventures he'd have gone on. She taught me all she knew and said it was time for me to learn what she could not teach me...and so, here I am.&quot; <br>
<br>
He nodded at her, &quot;that is quite...hmmm...well to be honest it is VERY interesting!&quot; <br>
<br>
She giggled nodding towards the blonde-haired boy who now sat in the middle of a group of girls from all races plucking at a lute. Roxxie smiled, &quot;let me guess...Nitle is a Bard...right!&quot; <br>
<br>
Jesp looked over at his stout celtic friend and laughed out right. &quot;Yes, Nitle is to be a bard...or a casanova...whichever comes first!&quot;, he chided with her. <br>
<br>
[i]Maybe this training area won't be so bad[/i], she thought as the two laughed together, talking and sharing stories with each other the rest of their season. <br>
