<br>
Leviathan was written in the late 1600's.  There were certain views of the world that are not currently up to date.  It remains a fantastic book for the social comentary and philosophy, but not so very good for perhaps biology.<br>
<br>
All we are is more extreme at the same things they are.  The difference is we have larger brains and can bind time perspective more accurately. Why did this happen?  In part because we started eating meat at some point in our history.  The meat protiens enabled us to develop larger brains.  We have opposable thumbs so we can create and use dynamic tool sets.  We are land creatures so we have use of fire and energy consumption work systems that water creatures do not.  We developed a communication skill that enabled us to pass on more than just emulative learning schema.  We are pattern seeking, story telling creatures.  Then again, so are most mammals, just to a lesser degree than we are. <p>DBC67<br>

<br>
DBC asked this question...<br>
<br>
What makes you think that we are so very different?<br>
<br>
I just want to answer it in my opinion.  What I think makes us so different is that we as humans appreciate things that other mammals do not.  When was the last time a dog stopped to smell the roses.  What about a chimp looking at a sunset and crying at its beauty.  How do these human traits fit into survival of the fittest or evolution? <br>
<br>
I am sure that you will have answers for all of these things.  I don't really want to get into a debate (I know, so why post on a debate board<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) about this.  I just wanted to add my .02 on this subject.  There are so many things that separate us from animals that it is hard for me to believe that we evolved. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

certainly you are aware of other meat eaters out there.  vultures have bird brains.  i'm not discrediting that there may be some valid explaination out there but i think i'm going to need a little more convincing than that.  maybe you have a link to a more modern leviathan? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Double Latte</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(1/6/03 1:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Sentimentality</span><hr size=1> Trish,<br>
I think appreciation is part of what our big brains do. Sentimentality is just a side-effect of having a big brain that thinks a lot and remembers well. Just because animals can't talk, doesn't mean they can't experience appreciate the beauty of nature. Just look at a cat streched out and snoozing in a sunbeam. They really appreciate life! Ever hear about the ape, Coco, who wrote poetry? They taught her sign language and all by herself she came up with:<br>
<br>
Flower Pink<br>
Pink Stink<br>
Pink Flower Stink<br>
<br>
Once she learned the words, she figured out that they rhymed. Her poem reflects on the color and scent of her subject, the flower. Pretty impressive huh? Makes humans seem not quite so special after all.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm not all that impressed with humans. We can be quite creatively barbaric.  Look at circumcision... it doesn't contribute to survival but people just keep doing it. No other animal would do that to it's young. All other mammals sleep with their young, while many humans put theirs in cages. We are the only mammal that will feed its young the milk of another animal and deny it our own milk. It's not uncommon for the male of our species to hurt or kill the young of a female he has claimed, when those young are not biologically his (notice how most child abuse/murder cases involve mom's new boyfriend - in fact a little girl was murdered by mom's boyfriend in Chicago on x-mas morning).<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I actually think that the human tendency toward ritual and religion may be a part of our evolution.  There may have been some point where religious humans had better luck surviving, maybe by pooling their resources or maybe just because they killed off those who didn't believe like them (historically, this has been how the religious have behaved toward others, and it's still happening in the middle east today.) I think religion a human trait that has outlived it's usefulness.<br>
<br>
BTW dogs do stop and smell the roses, then show their appreciation by peeing on them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>

First of all I am not saying we got big brains simply because we eat meat.  Secondly, vultures are birds, so of course they will have bird brains.  Weight is everything when you are a flying creature.  Too heavy = can’t fly.  Thirdly I said it was a conjunction of a number of causes.  Because we have an opposable thumb, we are better able to make and wield tools.  Because we have an ability to use these complex tool sets, a complex brain has more leverage.  What good would a large brain do a squid or an oak? <br>
<br>
Consider this, an acorn grows into a large tree when it has enough sun, water and earth.  Similarly, our brains were able to develop because all the conditions were met to encourage them.  All of the proteins we need to live and develop as we have are not available to a foragers diet if you do not add meat to the menu.  Our bodies do not produce them. This is no longer true today because we are no longer migratory foragers.  None of this would have mattered if there weren’t sufficient arid land for us to walk on.<br>

Allow me to suggest a visit to the public library and some research.  This is a debate board, not a classroom.  You will find many of the atheist participants here have read the bible, and several other works.  If you have a position to take that is well reasoned and backed by something more than “Yeah? Well what about this then…” I will be happy to engage in cut &amp; thrust discussions.  However, many of us are spending a great deal of energy in bringing you up to speed and it wears thin for me at least.<br>

What I find interesting is that people discount intelligence of any type in plants. No. I do not think that plants think the way we do, BUT I was told about an experiment done in my highschool a while back. The teacher took a bunch of plants and connected them to electrodes and took the base measurement and left the room. After a while, one student came in and tore one of the plants to shreads. The electrical patterns of the other plants went crazy. After a while of being in the room alone, the electrical patterns returned to baseline. One by one, the students returned to the room. The plants' electrical patterns stayed at baseline, until the student that had ripped the one plant to shreads came in. They started going crazy again until he backed away. <br>

I cannot explain this, but I thought it was interesting.<br>

Brain size beyond basic capacity does not relate to intelligence as we understand it.  The closest physiological connection I am aware of for intelligence measure is the number of nerve connections bridging the corpus collosum between the two hemispheres of the brain.  Very few are fond in children born handicapped, and far more than average are seen in the profoundly gifted.  Furthermore, brain activity tends to relate to motion and decision processes related to them.  Nerves feed back so that we can act.  Aside from rotating leaves to face light, I am not aware of a significant plant population that twitches (quick, someone mention the venus flytrap!)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The teacher took a bunch of plants and connected them to electrodes and took the base measurement and left the room. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I would ask what it was she was measuring?  Plants do not have an electro-nerual network the way higher order animals do.  There isn’t any nerve, nerve conduction, or internal electrical generation.  Consequently, the teacher would have been measuring something like a resistance.  I would be skeptical of this for many reasons, the least of which being its simplicity and ease for a scientist to recreate, not to mention it being anecdotal (you heard about it, not read a published paper on it.) <br>

<br>
This State of Nature is simply every man for himself, whose only concerns are to keep himself alive while grabbing and holding onto as much as he can for as long as he can.  And because nature has made man basically equal in body and mind, man is in a constant state of 'Warre' to preserve his own life and his property (this includes wife and children).<br>
<br>
The argument in Leviathan is for rule under a absolute monarch, in which he uses the biblical structure to justify it.  Basically we would all have to give up our natural rights in order to be ruled by this absolute monarch who is essentially responsible now for protecting our freedoms.<br>

Very few are fond in children born handicapped, and far more than average are seen in the profoundly gifted. Furthermore, brain activity tends to relate to motion and decision processes related to them. Nerves feed back so that we can act.

The Venus Flytrap does!! LOL... just kidding!! Oh. I do agree with you. I am not saying that plants have any type of intelligence comparable to any animal with a brain, but I don't see why they can't have some type of energy exchange that can be inturpreted as communication (at some level).<br>

<br>
To tell you the truth, it was back in 1989 when the teacher told us this (It was in my psychology class and the experiment was done in the late 70s). I really do not know what he was measuring and I wouldn't doubt that I got some of the terms wrong. I do believe that he did this experiment, but you are right. Since I heard it from him and did not see it myself, it is purely anecdotal. I would like to try and repeat it sometime though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

ok, sorry, this doesnt have much (anything)to do with the op, but i saw a special on animal planet the other day about evolution and what direction scientists (which scientists, i dont know) thought life and the planet is heading in.<br>
<br>
long story short, this most amusing hour long show theorizes that in 200 million years the most intelligent life on the planet will be a land dwelling squid like creature with a very complex brain.  mammals supposedly will no longer exist on this planet. (oh and pangea (sp?) comes back) <br>

<br>
Because they do not have a means of generating that energy they would be exchanging.  Plants communicate, but they do it through flowers and pollens.  They open a flower to attract a vector for distributing their fertility.  They release pollens that trigger chemical changes and similar releases in the surrounding flora.  They drop fruit that it can be consumed and the seeds contained therein deposited elsewhere.  However, this not an intelligent dialogue among plants.  This is a reactive issuance to trigger further reactions.<br>
