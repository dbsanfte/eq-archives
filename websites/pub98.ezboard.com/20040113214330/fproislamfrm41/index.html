<br><br>
Those that would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither.       - Benjamin Franklin
<br><br>
A lot has changed since 9/11 in the United States.  
<br><br>
Americans have learned what the “terror” part of “terrorist” means.  When the World Trade Center buildings collapsed, so did our innocence and our faith in the inherent goodness of all people.  Our belief that the United States was insulated from the violence and death that plagued the rest of the world was shattered; no longer could we afford to believe that our borders were impenetrable and sacrosanct.  And with the fear that gripped our country on that unforgettable day, a confused and bewildered government unable to cope with the complexity of the violence and the ensuing public demand for action, committed itself to a path that would lead us to where we are today.
<br><br>
Where are we today?  One year later we look at our country, and no one can say that much has not changed.  We are a different country with different values and different beliefs.  9/11 changed us more deeply than we care to admit; it planted a seed of fear into our collective hearts that took bloom, and fundamentally altered our view of the world in which we live.  In the ensuing months after 9/11, we gave President Bush free rein to bring the perpetrators of this heinous act to justice, and in the process we sold our conscience and our belief in liberty and equality for all to John Ashcroft’s War on Terror.
<br><br>
Mr. Ashcroft was desperate to react to the public outrage that was sweeping the nation.  He did what any other warm-blooded product of Jim Crow America would have done; he made 9/11 into a racial and cultural war, rather than clearly defining the causes of the violence and targeting the criminals that carried out the act.  The Bush Administration blamed al-Qaida without hesitation, and Ashcroft began a series of mass arrests of anyone with Arab blood or Muslim ideology.  “Christianity is a faith in which God sends his son to die for you,” he proclaimed, “[while Islam is] a religion in which God requires you to send your son to die for him.”  Untold thousands were arrested, put into solitary confinement, and there they would languish for up to 400 days or more, without access to an attorney, a judge, or even the charges made against them.  They would get 30 minutes of daylight a month, and one call to their families every year.  Civil rights groups tell us that thousands were arrested; we will never know because our government refuses to tell us who was arrested and what ultimately became of them.  We do that not one single person was ever convicted or even charged with any crime greater than passport forgery, and that these thousands of people were coerced into deportation for crimes as trivial as parking or moving violations.  Their fault?  Their faith.
<br><br>
Ashcroft’s next move was more contentious, mostly because it targeted Americans rather than the swarthy dark-skinned Arabs.  He arrested Americans and held them in direct contraindication of the Bill of Rights by refusing to file charges against them or giving them unfettered access to an attorney.  He even refused to present any evidence to their guilt.  One was finally tried, and a few others still await justice in judicial limbo.  Although they are US citizens, Mr. Ashcroft believes that these people present such a colossal threat to the security of the United States that he fears making the charges or evidence against them public even to a judge, and refuses to allow legal representation to these citizens of the United States.  But since these individuals had really renounced their American-ness by converting to Islam, the American public once again tolerated this infringement on their rights.
<br><br>
Once Ashcroft had shored up the weaknesses of the due process clause of the Constitution, he brought his attention to another pressing concern of the War on Terror; freedom of assembly.  He convinced federal judges to grant the FBI the right to spy on US citizens in their places of worship, although most people would agree that few, if any, FBI informants would be floating around America’s churches or synagogues.  As John Ashcroft and his staff started their day with their daily prayer to their Lord Jesus, Ashcroft made sure that Muslims across the country would never feel secure in their places of worship again.
