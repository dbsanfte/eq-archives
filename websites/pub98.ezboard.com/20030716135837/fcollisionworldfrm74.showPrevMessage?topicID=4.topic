Perhaps he thought to much of this event and sought to seek out more of it's meaning..<br>
<br>
The young man walked along the wake of the water, the tide rolled in and broke into a soft murmur, as if it was hushing to him a gentle lullaby.. He thought to himself solemnly, his eyes  focused on the horizon where the solitary moon met up with the sea reflected in it a distorted mirror image &quot;What am I doing here? I don't even know what I am doing.... if only.. I could find something.. a signal.. a clue.. maybe even a damn hint.. to what it is..&quot;<br>
<br>
The cadence of his step slows to an eventual halt.. his hands slipped into his pockets nonchalantly to prevent them from balling into fists.. he needed to relax, and wind down.. at times he felt as if he was going to scream at the top of his lungs into the midnight air... but he couldn't he was so wound up inside that letting loose like that would just show an inner weakness.. He knew that even he himself shied away from his own being.. It is hard living with an enmity betwixt soul and psyche.. instead he drew in a breath and released a sigh..<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm probably gonna stay out here all night just like last time..&quot; He thought to himself, as he crouched down and wrapped his arms around his knees cradling himself, and swaying with the murmur of the sea..<br>
<br>
Lost in proverbial thought he ached for some meaning and purpose, to his existence.. Giving into times constant siege, and destinies bitter pursuit, there is nothing  he could have done then but wait.. Wait for fate to approach him..<br>

She had left her steed tied to a tree some ways back, hoping to find some solitude here -- the sound of the waves always seemed to calm her.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, she stopped.  It seemed the beach was not so vacant after all.  She lifted her concealing hood to get a better look at the man before her.  After a moment, she decided he was all right, and approached him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mind if I join you?&quot;  She asked softly, as to not surprise him.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <p>~Samurai Girl<br>

However the man didn't flinch or offer a response for a good minute or so. He was lost in the murmur of the sea, caught up in it's trance. <br>

He finally looked back towards the woman, who approached him, then lowered his sunglasses, which he often wore even during the night..

Tomoe blinked, wondering why he had waited so long to answer her.  Ah well...it didn't really matter.<br>
<br>
She sat down beside him with a small sigh, looking out at the moonlit waters.  After a moment of silent consideration, she decided to speak again.  &quot;It's beautiful out here.&quot;<br>
<br>
It had been a while since she had simply watched the lonely moon make its way across the sky.  She could identify with such things...perhaps this man could as well.  In any case, it was nice to just sit there and relax for a change.<br>

He never was one to sound ostentatious in the first place. It is if he withdrawn himself from emotion within the presence of others..<br>
<br>
It was no doubt though that he found solace in the night and under the stars. He laid himself back into the sand, sitting on his long black coat, fixing his palms back behind his head to gaze at the nighttimes revel of celestial display. A semi-smile even crossed his face for a moment, but was gone the next.<br>

<br>
She had noticed another soul wandering along the beach some ways away, but had chosen to ignore him.  If he -- and she did assume it was a he -- wished to join them, he was welcome to.  She considered inquiring upon the man beside her about this, but thought better of it and said nothing.  It was obvious he hadn't come here to chit-chat...in reality, neither had she.<br>

There was something that seemed to draw him here. Their energy perhapse or maybe it was just the water itself. <br>
<br>
For once he didn't worry about his mission or the other gaeas. He just sat in a tall tree and watched the waves on the water. He didn't have to look at the night sky to see all its splendour. The beauty of the night was clearly portrayed in the beauty of the water washing onto the beach.<br>
<br>
It was times like these that his mind seemed the clearest. His thoughts were no longer clouded by hate and darkness. He began to remember the old days back on Gaea. The days when he and Princess Trinity had been close friends. The days when he wasn't trying to kill her. He found himself wishing that things were back to the way they once were.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amazoniteix>Amazonite IX</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://groups.msn.com/isapi/fetch.dll?action=MyPhotos_GetPubPhoto&PhotoID=nIgAAAGoKcY17gMIv8pzftAE0fcd3NevgE9xjNpYENjIF*H5WWT9SoslPKp55nizT5wx2jui3KFs" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puck</span><br>  Posts: 180<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(5/12/03 10:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Continued- Moonlit Solace</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:orange;">Jet soon 'sensed' the strangers and slowed his pace.
