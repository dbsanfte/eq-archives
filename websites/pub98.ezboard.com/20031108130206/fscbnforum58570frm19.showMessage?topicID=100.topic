This was the 3rd time &quot;Tina&quot; (the only name she would give) had been in his care in the last month. She couldn't have been more than 14, and had been on the streets at least 3 years. Or at least that's how far back he could trace her in the hospital computer records system. An all too recognizable pattern. If she wasn't being treated for an STD it was drug use. If it wasn't drug use, it was a John who liked it rough. If it wasn't a John, it was her pimp, for not letting the John have his way. Two weeks ago it had been Tina and the John. Apparently the John had gotten TOO rough. Her pimp didn't like having his merchandise damaged by others. &quot;Bless the bastard's heart for looking after her so... nicely.&quot; he thought grimly. &quot;For his sake, it would be best that he never end up in my care.&quot; Dr. James pulled the privacy curtain in place, noteing the still-fading bruises on her neck and arm from her last visit, among the ever present needle tracks. &quot;She isn't<br>
here about that shiner. She didn't have it last time.&quot; he thought with a<br>
frown. Her chart indicated she was complaining of abdominal pains. She was pale (which wasn't unusual) and her temperature was up, which was.<br>
<br>
&quot;My stomach hurts, Doc.&quot; she said when she saw him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well let's see if we can't figure out why.&quot; he told her and proceeded with the litany of questions and exam. When he had her lie back and raise her gown, he noted a nasty bruise on her side. She groaned in pain when he probed her abdomen with his fingers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did your pimp do this to you?&quot; he probed her bruised side gently, feeling as no mortal doctor could the broken rib. She hissed sharply and grabbed his wrist, but didn't answer the question. He tried to look her in the eye but she avoided his gaze. She always avoided the subject of her pimp. He told her to lower her gown again and placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder, then picked up her chart. &quot;I'm going to order some x-rays and a blood test. He broke another rib and you may have appendicitis. You're staying here tonight.&quot; He made some notes on the clipboard and added &quot;I'll deal with HIM.&quot; as she was about to protest that her pimp wouldn't allow it. One of the first things he had done when he had taken over as head of this ER was to ban all but next of kin from accompanying patients. He wouldn't have pimps intimidating his patients or his doctors in the exam area. They had to wait outside. He finished making his notes, gave her another reassuring pat on the shoulder and stepped around the privacy curtain, handing the chart to a nurse and giving her instructions.<br>
He signaled Officer Edwardo, who was just finishing up some paperwork on the drunk he and his partner had brought in, and they went into the waiting room to have a word with her pimp. He wouldn't be showing his face around the hospital again for a while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=strongbow1800>strongbow1800</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF9300>(5/19/03 3:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A night in the ER (cont)</span><hr size=1> <p>Dr. James returned from the ambulance bay where he had watched Officer Edwardo "persuade" Coffee the pimp that being seen around the university hospital was an unhealthy lifestyle choice.<br>
<p>Checking the board, he decided to look in on the patient in 4, who was being treated by one of his interns. He picked up the chart and examined it, listening as the intern gave the two nurses orders. A motorcycle accident. The patient was conscious and responsive, which was a good sign considering the severe damage to his helmet, still secured to the back board. Obvious broken left wrist, probably a compound fracture of the radius. The left leg of his riding leathers was badly torn, but it did it's job: his left leg only showed minor signs of road rash. This guy was smart. He wore good riding gear.<br>
<p>The patient was able to give a good squeeze with his right hand but couldn't move his left at all. His toes curled in the correct direction when the soles of his feet were probed and he head sensation in each toe.<br>
<p>"Can I get this damn helmet off?" the patient complained.<br>
<p>"Soon." Dr. Warowski said. "We have to be sure your head and neck are OK first."<br>
<p>Dr. Warowski ordered the relevant xrays, left arm and leg and Dr. James moved on, satisfied the intern was following correct procedure and could handle the situation. Dr. Warowski was new, but was already shaping up to be a fine physician.<br>
<p>Dr. James looked up at the clock. Three more hours to go. As head of dept. he could technically leave whenever he wanted, but he preferred to stick it out when he had new interns working the night shift. It gave him an opportunity to see them in their most stressful situations, and he felt it was good for them to see the boss grueling it out with them.<br>
<p>It was almost 3 AM. Things were starting to quiet down. The bars had been closed for an hour. Most of the drunks were either home by now or had already crashed and been brought in. 7 tonight. Plus two gunshot wounds and 3 stabbings. 4 beat up hookers and 6 drug overdoses.  And SCPD had brought in 3 homeless drunks who had managed to hurt themselves. "All in all a pretty quiet night." he thought to himself, sitting down on a stool in a currently un-used exam area. He pulled his last letter from Michelle out of his coat to read it again. Reading his Dame's letters always made him happy.<br>
<p>(OOC: Yes, I Googled it. I don't speak a word of French, but Dr. James and Michelle do, fluently. I'm sure the translation is horrible, but it will have to do. The entire letter is in French.)<br>
<blockquote><br>
<p>Mon Amour, (<em>My Love,</em>)<br>
     Je suis heureux d'entendre que la transition de San Francisco à Santa Carla est allée sans à-coup.  Je suis AM tellement très heureux vous San Francisco gauche. J'ai été tout inquiété...<br>
     (<em>I'm glad to hear the transition from San Francisco to Santa Carla went smoothly. I am so very glad you left San Francisco. I was quite worried. You remained there far too long.</em>)<br>
<p>     As for your query about Herr Orlock, I know very little. My inquiries have revealed nothing that causes me any concern, however. So far as I have been able to determine, he is a man of honor.<br>
<p>     My love, I know I need not mention this, but do please be careful around him. I know of your dislike for the German people. I know what you witnessed at Nordhausen and Ohrdruf and Buchenwald preys on your conscience. But if Herr Orlock was able to claim his position unopposed, and supported by your superiors, he is a man of much power. You must avoid ever even the appearance of insult or disloyalty. I have faith in your diplomacy, my Childe.<br>
<p>     Thank you for the sketch of the full moon over the Boardwalk. It is lovely. I have hung it in my boudoir next to your charcoal "Retreat of Task Force Faith from Chosin to Hagaru-ri", the one you gave me when I left San Francisco for Paris. I hope I may visit you in your Santa Carla soon. The "Big Dipper" looks like great fun.<br>
<p>     Attendant avec intérêt la nuit quand je puis vous tenir dans des mes bras encore,<br>
     (Looking forward to the night when I may hold you in my arms again,)<br>
          tout mon amour,<br>
         (all my love.)<br>
               Votre Michelle<br>
              (Your Michelle)<br>

<p>The automatic sliding door to the emergency entrance disgorged a gurney flanked by paramedics rushing another patient in, accompanied by the flashing red and white lights of the ambulance. Dr. James stuffed the letter into his coat and went back to work. Two and a half hours to go. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=100.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=100.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm20">SchreckNET™ (Nos only)<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246i<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
