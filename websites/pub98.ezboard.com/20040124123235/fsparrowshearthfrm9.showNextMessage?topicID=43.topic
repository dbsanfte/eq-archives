<br>
Since Sat. I've been on pins and needles.  I did a photo-shoot and it was, by far, the most embarrassing episode I've had behind a camera. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
It was after a wedding, I was taking the usual pictures of the bride/groom, wedding party, etc.  After about 11 shots, my camera froze.  I panicked.  I mean, people, hear me....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:green;font-family:verdana;font-size:medium;">I am NOT the person you want beside you in a crisis...</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
Yes, I hate to admit it, but I do not do so well under stress.  I am thankful I didn't start crying.  ...seriously.<br>
<br>
Anyway, when my camera stopped working, my brain seemed to quit too.  The men I had posed were waiting on me, and the guests (over 100 of them) were waiting of course for the couple to come for the reception.  And, here I am...completely red in the face trying to figure out WHY my camera won't work!!!<br>
<br>
I tried everything I could think of (which wasn't much since my brain was frozen too) and nothing worked.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Thank the Good Lord,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I had a spare with me.  My old camera..nothing a'tall fancy, just a good reliable SLR.  I quickly loaded it up, changed my lenses and was back in the shooting mode.<br>
<br>
But, honestly, for the rest of the hour I was there....I think I was operating on auto-pilot.  I just could NOT believe that this moment had just occured....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :klt --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/kilt.gif ALT=":klt"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :klt --><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/Sparrow'sHearth/kilt.gif ALT=":klt"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When I left, I was so upset that I drove to a travel plaza and just sat in my van wondering what in the world went wrong.  I prayed...I just felt so humiliated.<br>
<br>
Later, as I was probing further into the problem with my camera I noticed that aside from the glitch, one of my exposure settings was incorrect.  So, I had been shooting with incorrect lighting too ......<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
By this point, I was already going over in my mind just HOW I would approach this wonderful couple and tell them that I had ruined their photos; what I might do to compensate them, the words I would use...everything.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I prayed a lot....not to sound too selfish, as I know having great photos is a trivial matter considering the state of the WORLD,....but He does say to take EVERYTHING to Him in prayer!  I just wanted to make something beautiful for this couple, and that special day cannot come again.  <br>
<br>
As I drove to the lab this evening, I said, &quot;Dear Lord, please just help me to accept this...if it's to be a lesson in humility, give me the strength and the grace to bear it...as I will know that if anything good results from my feeble attempts, it will be a gift from You.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I'm here to testify! [flashbacks of some tent revivals I've been to!]  .....these photos are nothing what I thought they would be.  A few of them are very poor, but some of them are truly, well, the light was just right, and the look in their eyes....well, all I can say is it's a gift from God.  And I am very, VERY thankful!!!!  <br>

In a good way.  I sort of knew where you were going with it when you said the first camera wouldn't work.  I was trying to think, ok... what's REALLY wrong with your main camera.<br>
<br>
People have said it before, people will say it again.  The Lord works in mysterious ways.<br>

Thank God and congratulations that things went well! <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man.<br>

<br>
Yes EVERYTHING to HIM in prayer!  That's exactly how I felt about the shower, I wanted to honor and glorify God, as well as give the best baby shower possible to my little sister.  So many times I've been put in your position, being the responsible party should anything go wrong, and there seems to always be glitches but God works them out.  I pray a lot too over 'little' things I suppose, but I don't leave out the 'big' things either, it's all for HIM.  Right?  <br>
I think you did wonderfully.  In the study I'm in now, today, it talked about how when we are close to God is when 'the enemy' does his best to try to get us off track where our walk with God is concerned.  How both large and inconsequential (to others at least) events are trials which we are perfected here on earth for God's glory in the kingdom to come.  THANK YOU JESUS!  HE always comes through, sometimes in the most unexpected ways.  <br>
