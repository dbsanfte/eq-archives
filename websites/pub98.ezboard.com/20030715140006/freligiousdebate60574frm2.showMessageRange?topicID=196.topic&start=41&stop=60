<br>
Thank you for clarifying this, Candy, because that is an important differentiation.  For whatever reason, ST, you acted defensively and not at all in the reasonable manner that I usually associate with your arguements.  I didn't hear anyone say that a woman should not work, period.  Some parents work because they have to, some do because they perform a vital service to the public, others because they enjoy the mental and social stimulation that working outside the home can offer.  There's nothing wrong with any of this, imo.  It's when I hear about a couple who dump their kids off on a nanny or in daycare for 10 hours a day, five days a week not because they need the money to survive, but because they find parenting a small child just a little too difficult or inconvenient that makes me wonder, Well then, why the hell did you bother?  These kids are only here because we put them here, and every one of them deserves better than that, from their moms AND dads.  That' all I'm sayin'.<br>
As for the sexism issue, I can only refer to the experience of my own family where the women always worked.  My grandmothers and my mother all worked because they had to.  But my mom and dad made darn sure that us kids were never without them for more than an hour or so, even when it meant working graveyard shifts or, as my mom did when I was a toddler, cleaning houses for rich folks so I could come to work with her.  We make these kinds of sacrifices for our kids because they are our responsibility.  And that's where I'm coming from.<br>
<br>
By the bye, on the sharing household duties: Dh is the kitchen man, he cleans it and does the dishes.  If he's home he'll sometimes cook (on workdays he gets home too late).  I do laundry and general cleaning, vaccuuming, etc.  We pretty much split up yard work.  After dinner, I consider myself mostly off the parental clock, except now that we have 2 kiddies we divide and conquer at bedtime.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I think that means you lose the debate when you get so upset that you cease to make sense. <br>
<br>
No one is attacking you, not anymore than you meant to attack us. You don't seem to have any ability to see what you said, and how it made be construed as non-support. You jumped on a tangent, over a point of DBC's post that you read incorrectly, and then you made a very broad, unsupportable statement, which you were called on. Some of us gave extreme examples to make a point. I don't think a single person on here ever said you shouldn't have kids because you work.  Your choice is to work, and for good reasons, but without saying &quot;For me, I've done both, and for me, it is less stressful to be home&quot;....you came across as belittling.<br>
<br>
I think what the vast majority of us have said has been crystalline. It's tough to be a parent, WOH or SAH. You have to do what works for you, and what works for your family. But you shouldn't stand up, and villify the other side to make yourself feel better, which is how you came across. I support WOH moms and dads, and the SAHP, on the presumption that they have found what works for them.<br>
<br>
I think that's what we were asking you to take a step back and look at. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=powertotherae>Powertotherae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Satan's Lil' Minion</span><br>  Posts: 267<br> <font color=#3333ff>(5/2/03 8:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=196.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Wow</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There's nothing wrong with any of this, imo.

Thank you Simone that was what I was trying to say but it obviously didn’t come out that way. I never meant to say that if you work you shouldn’t have kids.<br>

I don't mean to be sexist with my comments about my husband. He just is absolutely useless when it comes to infants. As DS gets older he is starting to do more and more with him, but I don't think he willingly held Edison the first 2 months of his life. Infants terrify him. Now he should have worked at getting over it, but that's neither here nor there. But frankly, he is the better parent (normally) of our toddler. He and she work out disagreements better. I think he compromises way too much with her, but I don't interfer with him and her and he doesn't interfer with me and her. I also think he probably believes I'm too unmovable at times. Of course I am also the one here all day every day. An almost three year old is hard at times. Especially one like Laurel.<br>
<br>
DH is also perfectly capable of cleaning and picking up. He just doesn't. And when he does pick up he won't put things into their right place. They just go into what every shelf, box, etc that is closest. And DH can't cook. His mother never taught him. And he moved in with me two weeks after leaving his mother's house. Ohh mistake on my part. Should have made him work on his own for a while. <br>
<br>
Thisisn't the example I grew up with. My Dad was very much an active part of house hold chores and child raising - well less of the child raising, his temper would never have suited him to be a long term sahd. Even now, my dad cooks easily 75% of my parents dinners. If I need cooking advice (more often then I like to admit) all but for one meal, I call Dad and ask him. Actually, a lot of house hold questions I call Dad and ask him. He's talked me through fixing my lawnmower, installing a perminate babygate, fixing a broken faucet, getting grease stains out of clothing. So its very frustrating that DH does so little. And I do worry about hte example it is setting for my children. <br>

I work part-time, so I can take offense from either side <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Seriously, I think there have been a lot of misunderstandings here, and that's not unusual on boards like this.  I read Stacey's first post as kind of a slam on SAH moms, saying how much less stress they have--and I disagreed with that.  I had not read anything I interpreted as negative about working women before that, so I didn't see her post as a defense.  Then the &quot;why have kids?&quot; posts about working women really rubbed me the wrong way, I have lots of friends who got pregnant knowing they would be going back to work full-time and they are great parents.  I thought that attitude was very judgmental.  But obviously none of these statements were meant the way they sounded.  I think we all agree that we all love our kids and have to do whatever works best for our families.  This is just a very sensitive topic-I don't think there are many things that make me more defensive than someone telling me I'm not a good mom.  But I honestly don't think anyone was saying that about anyone here, and I apologize if I misinterpreted anything that was said.<br>

<br>
DBC then said that being at work all day is a “way different order of pressure” than what a SAHM parent has, which is to say it is much less stressful to work than be at home. I took issue with this, just as many of you took issue with me saying I think being home is less stressful. If you equate stress with importance or value, you have bought into the mysoginistic, corporate mindset that eats away at the very credibility of socially important work in general and that’s too bad. When I typed that message out, I was actually thinking it was nice which is why I compared it to teaching, which I also found less stressful but far more important than corporate/technical work. But ya know—it’s not the double standard here I find most alarming…the fact that it’s okay to say SAHM’s have so much more stress but I can’t disagree…it’s the gratuitous, bullshit backpeddling going on by those who clearly stated that having children with no intent to quit work is selfish and these people have no right to have kids. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Candy—you didn’t direct your statement toward me? Odd because since you know both my dh and I work full time you know our kids are in daycare 50 hours a week. You did specify the hours in your post right? So to be clear, you WERE indeed saying parents like myself (more specifically mothers who choose to work) are &quot;dumping&quot; their kids off and &quot;why did they have kids anyway&quot; right?  <br>
If you feel kids in daycare are neglected or somehow receive less parenting, than whether we choose to work or not doesn’t change the fact that the children are suffering either so by that token all single working parents are also “dumping kids off” and not raising them. You can say it's a shame these children get sub-par parenting, but I think it's time you back that up with more than your opinion and stop differentiating by choice. If 50 hours of daycare is harmful, then it's harmful regardless of why mommy is at work. <br>
<br>
powertotherae--I understand about any parent staying home, but your statement would still apply to me and it was a general one, not one that said each should do what is best, if that's not what you meant than I'm glad, but I'm not sure what you did mean in that post. Perhaps since I am not part time and my dh works also I am still irresponsible and unworthy in your eyes, I cannot tell.<br>
<br>
As I have mentioned before, this is a DEBATE board, not a support one and since there has been not one shred of actual evidence yet provided here either way, and since there is clearly a double standard as to what can be said about what is stressful or fits each family, it is quite silly to claim there are winners or losers. <br>
<br>
I clearly got personal, but tried to be clear who I was directing it toward and had no intention of rebuffing an argument since no logical one has been made. Candy can say all she wants that working parents who put their children in daycare 50 hours a week don’t deserve children (like me), but where was the evidence data for her argument? Who was she being supportive of with that statement? Only the very next post even addressed it, so was her post so much less offensive than mine saying staying at home was less stressful? In what way? Did I ever say any SAHP's don't have the right to children or that children of SAHP's are receiving less parenting? You would think so reading through this thread. Was the &quot;workaholic&quot; and &quot;why bother&quot; not a nasty little comment in the first place? None of you seem to think so, but this is indeed subjective. <br>
<br>
If me telling her to fuck off offends some here, then I am sorry for that<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> …didn’t realize profanity was now forbidden since DBC often tells Candy her arguments are bullshit and I never minded that myself. Had this been an actual argument or debate where points and data were being presented this would have been Ad hominem Maximus and still is really, but when someone tells me I shouldn't have bothered to have kids they can fuck off, so you're right, this was just gut reaction...perhaps Candy wishes to make an actual point we can debate and I'll promise to forgo the logical fallacies.<br>
<br>
Again—my comments about stress WERE stated as personal experience and on the heels of my ACTUAL original post in support of individual decision and I specifically stated I hate prescribed gender roles and telling women their education is wasted. Anyone misunderstanding that and getting upset is unfortunate and I’m sorry for that too…but that is a different issue than the 2 ladies who are making specific statements about the worthiness of other parents and while my language may be too offensive for some on this board, I stand by the sentiment directed at anyone who feels she is a superior mother to women who &quot;choose&quot; to work or feels her kids are getting betther mothering than mothers who work regardless of circumstance. Hope you're always lucky enough not to have to work Candy so your kids don't have to be &quot;dumped&quot; in daycare all week.<br>

I've been tooling around on the 'net, and many of the &quot;experts&quot; on various websites say there is no study proving one way or another whether child care--or how much--is good or bad for young children.  The NIH conducted a study in the 90's of 1300 children which stated:<br>
<br>
[r]esearchers found that the amount of nonmaternal child care was weakly associated with less sensitive and engaged mother-child interactions. The more time infants and toddlers spent in non-maternal child-care arrangements, the less sensitive and positively involved were mothers with their infants at 6 months of age, the more negative they were with them at 15 months of age, the less positively affectionate the child was toward the mother at 24 and 36 months of age, and the less sensitive mothers were to their toddlers at the 36 month point.<br>

<br>
However, the study focused mostly on what constituted high quality child care, as the variables involved with mother-child bonding (i.e. family environment, education, financial status, etc) were too great, I believe, to make broad statements about the effects of child care in general.  They did state, however, that  &quot;[t]hey found that child care, in and of itself, neither adversely affects, nor promotes, the security of children's attachment to their mothers at the 15 month age point, provided the children were already receiving relatively sensitive care from their mothers.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;...the fact that it's okay to say SAHM's have so much more stress but I can't disagree...&quot;<br>
<br>
I can't speak for anyone else, but I don't think the issue was who is &quot;right&quot; about which is less stressful, or anyone's right to agree or disagree.  What I thought you were saying in your post was essentially that *everybody knows* it's way, way, way more stressful to work than to stay home--and I took issue with that.  Not because I know it's more stressful to stay home, but because that is my experience.  My point was that we all have different experiences in this area and there is no right or wrong--you can't say what someone else should or will find more stressful.  If you were not saying that working was definitely more stressful, then I misinterpreted.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Was the 'workaholic' and 'why bother' not a nasty little comment in the first place? None of you seem to think so, but this is indeed subjective.&quot;<br>
<br>
You're wrong there.  Those comments offended me when I read them, and I said so.  Not because they applied to me directly, but because I have plenty of friends who had children knowing they would be going back to work full-time (some by choice, some by necessity) and I happen to know they are great mothers with happy children.  While perhaps poorly worded, after reading later posts I don't think either person meant these comments the way some of us took them.  I'm sure at some point we've all made comments that people have taken out of context, and I would hope people would give me the benefit of the doubt if I explained that I didn't mean it that way.<br>
<br>
&quot;If me telling her to fuck off offends some here, then I am sorry for that.  I didn't realize profanity was now forbidden since DBC often tells Candy her arguments are bullshit and I never minded that myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Profanity isn't forbidden here, obviously.  But I think there is a big difference in saying an argument is bullshit and telling someone to fuck off--that's just my opinion.  Candy is a regular here, not a troll or troublemaker, and I personally think she has earned more respect than that.  I didn't see anyone telling you to fuck off when they were offended by your comments--which you later clarified for those who took offense and misinterpreted them, just as Candy did.  I think it's better to give somebody a chance to explain before flying off the handle and getting so nasty.<br>

It seems that backfired because we were dismissed for not supplying hard data and studies &quot;proving&quot; where kids are better off. In truth I don't think you CAN prove kids are better off since every situation revolves around unique individuals in differing circumstances and with differing needs. <br>
<br>
Sometimes being in a daycare situation gets a kid OUT of a bad parenting situation for several hours a day. (and no Stacey, that was certainly <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> directed at you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) I also agree with Stacey that WHY a parent works makes no difference - whatever effects daycare may have are not negated by the parent's &quot;need&quot; to work. So saying someone shouldn't work if they can afford to quit is purely a moral judgement. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I got pregnant and had my daughter knowing full well I would have to return to work when she was just 6 weeks old, so even though I am now a SAHP I guess I am as undeserving of children as anyone else who was slapped with that epithet. Was she worse off being in &quot;daycare&quot;? Probably not. I had my cousin sit for her, an arrangement that allowed her to quit her low-paying job and stay home with her own two girls while watching my daughter. So my working allowed stay-at-home parenting for 2 more children AND my daughter was cared for in a stay-at-home parent situation. <br>
<br>
Again, that is all very subjective and was just what worked in our situation. I quit my job because I wanted to be home and enjoy the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of seeing my children through their early years. It was a personal choice not based on any statistics.<br>

the language here about throwing a baby into daycare (violent or at least careless imagery) the minute it's born...&quot; creates visual of careless working mom tossing 2 day old through KinderCare door while slowing her BMW down just enough to not scuff her Feragami's. You really didn't think that would strike a nerve? You really think that's the attitude and situation for kids in daycare?<br>
<br>
&quot;Not the parents who have to work just to make ends meet, but the ones who choose their careers over their children...why have children in the first place?&quot;<br>
<br>
Again...if being &quot;thrown in daycare the minute&quot; a child is born is harmful, it hardly matters why he/she is there. Are you saying it's okay to toss your tot carelessly into a neglectful situation and let someone else raise the kids you had no right to bear if that's what it takes to pay the bills? Perhaps not, perhaps you feel welfare would be in order for the single parent, but since you haven't clarified I cannot tell. Please explain daycare is worse for kids, but it's okay if you're poor.<br>
<br>
Oh--and making shitty statements about the right of groups to bear children doesn't make it okay. You could have said the same about poor, uneducated women, gay couples or even interracial. If you had said, &quot;why bother brining a child into the work just to suffer racism--what right to these interracial couples have?&quot; but not used names, would it have been surprising for a person with a bi-racial child to take offense? But why, you didn't use her name? Like I said, backpeddling and the fact is you still refuse to present a reasoned argument or proof. You aren't clarifying like some people, rather your response to me was along the lines of &quot;if the shoe fits...&quot;<br>
<br>
You see the difference is I actually respect the choice SAHP's make, not just accept, respect. I respect your motherhood and right to bear children, you do not respect mine. That's fine, but on a debate board you should bring something more than stereotypes and false assumptions (workaholics, poor daycare, etc.)<br>
I guess it's the same as the hell thing. I respect your right to believe and practice what you want, you think I will burn in hell. Should I have been surprised? Shit, no. Should I have told you to fuck off? Gosh, probably not...it's a good point that getting emotional is not appropriate in debate.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It didn't seem like much of a debate, but I honestly knew when I posted it, it wasn't furthering anyone's argument--guilty there. Purely an expression of my feelings there.<br>
<br>
Like I said though Candy...if you have anything more than condescending, baseless, judmental quips to offer, we can discuss the merits of the SAHP vs. WOHP thing. If this is just opinion and labeling, then I would say we've beat this horse to death.<br>

<br>
You didn't ask me, but I will share that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I wanted children</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and that's why I got pregnant even though I worked and had to return to work when my daughter was a newborn. It was never an either/or choice between children and working. Some people are lucky enough to have the brains and energy to manage both. <br>
<br>
Simone, I have some questions for you:<br>
<br>
Why would a SINGLE woman who MUST return to work to support herself and her baby <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>choose</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to have children in the first place? Would you prefer she abort? Or should she remain celebate rather than risk pregnancy, birth and the dreaded daycare?<br>
<br>
Why would a woman, pregnant and facing divorce CHOOSE to continue the pregnancy and put the child in the dreaded daycare to support it? Would you prefer she abort? Or must she give the child up for adoption? If not, why is daycare okay for her child?<br>
<br>
What if she was widowed? Must she abort or give up her deceased husband's child rather than put it in daycare? What if she gives it up for adoption, and the adoptive mother chooses to return to work and the child ends up in daycare anyway?<br>
<br>
What about kids a woman already has when she ends up single for whatever reason (death, divorce)? Should they be farmed out to SAHP's rather than be put in daycare?<br>
<br>
Edited to add: What if her husband is simply demoted at work and can no longer support the family on his income alone? If the mother must return to work, should they put the kids up for adoption to avoid the trauma of daycare?<br>
<br>
Why is daycare fine if you &quot;must&quot; work but a no-no if you have some kind of choice in the matter? Those slagging off on daycare have not bothered to clarify this very good point that Stacey brought up several posts ago.<br>
<br>
Why should a married career woman forgo the joys, love and challenges of motherhood or be forced to choose between that and her career? <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>More importantly, when would you  suggest a MAN should choose between the two?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Most importanly, I would like you to clarify what is so terrible about daycare REALLY? Do you object to all non-maternal care (as I write this, my toddler is playing with his sitter on my front porch - she's a college student majoring in child development... she helps me out with him when I'm writing grants -- isn't this daycare of a sort?) My working neighbor's son is cared for all day by his doting grandma while another SAHM on my block puts her children at a large daycare center about 8 hours a week so she can have a little time to herself. A mom in my LLL group works all day while her husband watches her child. Another mom runs a group daycare out of her home 12 hours a day - she's home with her son yet he's in a daycare situation all day anyway. Which kids do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>you</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> think are better off? I can't tell, they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> seem healthy and fine to me.<br>

<br>
When I said the comment what is the point of having kids. To be honest I really don’t know. I am an all or nothing person so for me if I couldn’t SH then I wouldn’t have kids. So I honestly cannot understand what the purpose of having children would be for me if I couldn’t be there all the time. I also don’t want to share the joy of my children with anyone (except of course my dh).<br>
<br>
My worst fear in life is that I will die and my kids will end up in daycare. I honestly don’t know why. So I guess I am a hater of daycare. Maybe its because I have been a SAHM this whole time and haven’t had any experience with daycare. All I hear are my friend’s horror stories and that is what sticks in my mind.<br>
<br>
The distinction I made about someone choosing to go back to work didn’t come out right. I personally have friends who had kids because that is what they are supposed to do but really don’t want to be involved. So they couldn’t wait to put their kids in daycare so they could get their life back. To me that is annoying. I have friends who don’t work but have full time nannies so they don’t have to be tied down. That is where I was coming from with my comment. And yes to me I see no point in having kids if you don’t even enjoy them. <br>
<br>
Does this clarify at all where I am coming from? I have been thinking about this for days trying to figure out a way to explain where I am coming from without making it seem that I think people who put their kids in daycare are bad parents.<br>

So they couldn’t wait to put their kids in daycare so they could get their life back. To me that is annoying. I have friends who don’t work but have full time nannies so they don’t have to be tied down. That is where I was coming from with my comment. And yes to me I see no point in having kids if you don’t even enjoy them.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know people like that as well and it IS annoying. The worst example is that my dh used to work with this woman who expressed shock that I would ~choose~ to stay home with our dd and said in her opinion, women who stayed home were drains on society and when she had kids, she put them in daycare as soon as possible because she wanted to be &quot;productive&quot;. She didn't seem to like her children very much and even said that she had had them because she was in &quot;that part of life.&quot; I don't know what her husband's feelings about having children were.<br>
<br>
Now I certainly don't advocate abortion, but, in my opinion, I do wonder why she had kids. Not why she continued her pregnancies, but why she chose to go off birth control and get pregnant in the first place. (Yes, I know BC fails sometimes but in this case, she chose to get pregnant..she said as much.) <br>
<br>
I'm not a &quot;daycare-hater&quot;...I have many friends who work and have their kids in good daycare situations and everybody is happy and well-adjusted. My own dd goes to daycare at the local YMCA a couple mornings a week while I work out. And it's been a great experience for her because she is learning to socialize and interact with other children. She loves it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am starting to ramble now, and I think I need to go change a diaper....there's a suspicious smell coming from the general vicinity of my dd and her toybox! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I don't know how old your kids are, but do any of them go to preschool or kindergarten, and do you plan to send them to regular school instead of homeschooling?  I was just wondering where you draw the line at sharing the joy of your children with someone else, and if there is some magic age where it's OK for you to not be with them 24 hrs. a day.  I'm not trying to be sarcastic here, I just don't understand what you mean by that.<br>
<br>
&quot;All I hear are my friend’s horror stories and that is what sticks in my mind.&quot;<br>
<br>
What kinds of horror stories?  Are they really all bad--no good ones?  I've had my dd in the same home daycare 3 days/wk for 2 years (she is now almost 3) and I have not one horror story to tell.  My daycare provider is wonderful and dd loves it there.  She is an only child and the social skills she has learned from being with the other kids has been invaluable.  She has a blast with her little friends and talks about them all the time.  She has been sick a total of one time in 2 years.  I have no doubt that this arrangement is better for her than if I stayed home with her full-time--can you understand why I feel that way in this situation?<br>
<br>
&quot;I have friends who don’t work but have full time nannies so they don’t have to be tied down.&quot;<br>
<br>
No great insights here--you just must have richer friends than I do! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They are 3 and 17 months. So I am not there yet. I signed Bella up for pre-school next year and it was very traumatic for me! Like I said I am an all or nothing person so the thought of my kids not being with me always has been a hard one. I do realize that I have to let go. I just haven’t wanted to yet. They are just little girls.<br>

That is why I said I have no experience with daycare. So I have a biased opinion. My opinion only comes from other people. Most of horror stories are not extreme but enough for me to feel sad for their little kids. Mostly mean care givers and things like that.<br>

<br>
I have two kids (an one more on the way)  and tons of friends who are SAHM. We are also involved in a lot of activates. So I guess if I didn’t have that I would find some way to have Bella in an activity where she gets to be with kids. It wouldn’t be daycare. I honestly think I have a phobia about daycare. Not to say you are bad I just wouldn’t do it. Maybe I am abnormal because I am not ready to let go of my kids. I don’t know. It is going so fast and I don’t want to miss one thing. I don’t want to have any regrets. Does that make sense?<br>
