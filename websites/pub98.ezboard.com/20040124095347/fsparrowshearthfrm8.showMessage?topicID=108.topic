Posted: August 4, 2003<br>
<br>

<br>
California Gov. Gray Davis added fuel to his opponents' recall fire by signing a controversial bill that authorizes fines of up to $150,000 for companies or nonprofit groups, such as the Boy Scouts, that discriminate against cross-dressers, transsexuals or drag queens. <br>
<br>
The governor signed the measure Saturday along with the $71.1 billion budget for fiscal year 2003-4. The move fell under the radar screens of most California media outlets. <br>
<br>
The law, which will take effect Jan. 1, 2004, adds &quot;gender identity or expression&quot; to the characteristics protected under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act and specifically protects residents whose &quot;perceived gender characteristics are different from those traditionally associated with the individual's sex at birth.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Assembly approved the bill in April by a vote of 41 to 34, the minimum needed to pass. The state Senate, led by Democrats, followed suit earlier this month with a vote of 23 to 11. <br>
<br>
The new law, which provides an exemption for religious groups, makes California the fourth state to bar discrimination on the basis of &quot;perceived gender,&quot; behind New Mexico, Rhode Island and Minnesota. <br>
<br>
Homosexual-rights advocates hail the law as a victory that's been a long time in coming. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's a very big issue for the LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] community in California,&quot; Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, told the Associated Press. &quot;It's something we've been working on for three years.&quot; <br>
<br>
The measure, titled AB 196, was one of a package proposed this year by the five-member Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Caucus. Earlier this year, the state Assembly passed a bill that would award virtually all the rights of marriage to homosexual &quot;domestic partners.&quot; The Senate is expected to take it up next month. <br>
<br>
&quot;Having a law that specifically states who's protected makes it clear to employers that the majority of people in California want transgender people to be able to work in a nondiscriminatory environment,&quot; said Chris Daley, co-director of the Transgender Law Center in San Francisco. <br>
<br>
Arguing for its necessity, the bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, cites a 1999 study by the San Francisco Department of Public Health indicating the city's transgender population had a 70 percent unemployment rate. <br>
<br>
&quot;We must do everything in our power to protect such fundamental human rights,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
Opponents call the move bad for business. Employer groups such as the California Chamber of Commerce and the California Manufacturers and Technology Association warn the law's overly subjective definitions will spawn frivolous lawsuits. Just about any comment or action between workers could be grounds for a lawsuit, they contend. <br>
<br>
Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy of Monrovia was one of several members who spoke about how the measure harms California businesses during debate in the Assembly. <br>
<br>
&quot;If I have a Christian bookstore, how could I possibly follow this law?&quot; he asked. &quot;How could I possibly have an employee that's here today in a dress, tomorrow may come in a suit, and then stay in a dress? How can I possibly employ this employee and still have the Christian bookstore and live by my faith?&quot; <br>
<br>
Randy Thomasson, executive director of Campaign for California Families, a statewide family issues leadership organization, describes the law as &quot;attacking persons of conscience.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Average people think it's outrageous to force the sex-change lifestyle upon businesses and Boy Scouts. Gray Davis has apparently lost his senses,&quot; he said. &quot;With his signature on AB 196, Davis has declared war on Californians who object to sex-change operations.&quot; <br>
<br>
As WorldNetDaily reported, Davis' signature will likely motivate opponents to turn out in greater numbers for the Oct. 7 recall vote. <br>
<br>
Less than a year into his second term, Davis is grappling with a staggering deficit projected at more than $38 billion and rock-bottom approval ratings. He becomes the first sitting governor in the history of California and only the second in U.S. history to face a recall election. <br>
<br>
The governor derides the drive to oust him as &quot;a hostile takeover by the right,&quot; and allies have said they expect to spend $15 million to $20 million to keep him in office. <br>
<br>
With the Aug. 9 filing deadline looming, hundreds of people  from activists and filmmakers to a comedian and billboard queen  have filed to have their names added to the ballot. Self-described &quot;smut peddler&quot; Larry Flynt joined the dozens who have paid the $3,500 filing fee. <br>
<br>
U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, who bankrolled the recall signature-gathering recall effort with $1.7 million of his own money  is the only declared Republican in the race. Failed gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon and state Sen. Tom McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks are expected to run. Others contemplating a run are state Sen. Bruce McPherson, R-Santa Cruz, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and controversial, nationally syndicated radio talk-show host Michael Savage. <br>
<br>
Opponents of the &quot;cross-dresser bill&quot; plan to hold a news conference tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. at the State Treasurer's Building in Sacramento to highlight the law's detrimental effect on business. Speakers will include Thomasson and other pro-family leaders, including local ministers representing black, white and Latino voters. <br>
<br>
&quot;By supporting the transsexual agenda that hurts everyone else, Gray Davis has earned his recall,&quot; said Thomasson. &quot;The in-your-face transsexual agenda makes voters very angry. ... Gray Davis tried to hide his actions by signing this radical sex-change bill under cover of the budget, but he won't get away with it.&quot; <br>

Davis signs ban on bias against transgenders <br>
Leno bill makes state 4th in U.S. to provide them with protected status <br>
<br>
Mark Martin, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau   Tuesday, August 5, 2003   <br>
<br>
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis, quietly jumping into a potentially hot-button gay- rights issue as he struggles to persuade voters to keep him in office, has signed legislation making it illegal for landlords and businesses to discriminate against transgendered people. <br>
<br>
Davis' signature means California will become the fourth state in the country to add gender to the list of protected traits such as race and sex in the Fair Housing and Employment Act. <br>
<br>
The signing of the measure San Francisco Assemblyman Mark Leno originated comes as recent developments such as the Supreme Court's rejection of sodomy laws has generated a larger discussion about equal rights for gay, lesbian and transgendered people. <br>
<br>
The signing also became the latest example of the politics of the Oct. 7 recall election coloring the governor's every move. <br>
<br>
Davis' critics suggested he had signed Leno's bill to woo gay voters -- a crucial voting bloc for the unpopular Democrat -- but avoided publicizing the signing to avoid alienating moderate voters. Davis' press office listed the bill with 23 other measures the governor signed in a statement released at 6 p. m. Saturday, the same day Davis signed a new state budget. <br>
<br>
Still, Leno and others said the governor's approval of AB196 was a noteworthy victory. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is a significant piece of civil rights legislation,&quot; said Leno, who held a news conference in San Francisco Monday to tout the new law. &quot;We have had a segment of our community who up until now had no protection against discrimination.&quot; <br>
<br>
CALIFORNIA IS 4TH <br>
<br>
California joins Michigan, New Mexico and Rhode Island as the only states to specifically ban discrimination against transgendered people in areas such as housing and employment. Gender is defined as a person's identity, appearance or behavior, regardless of whether that identity is the same as the person's sex at birth. <br>
<br>
Employers would still be able to use dress codes as long as workers are allowed to dress as the gender they prefer. <br>
<br>
The state Department of Fair Employment and Housing could issue fines as high as $150,000 to employers or landlords who discriminate. <br>
<br>
The bill was approved by the Legislature entirely along party lines -- no Republican voted for it. <br>
<br>
Davis' signature was seen by many as part of a political strategy by a governor who needs big help from special-interest groups who have supported him in the past. With Davis running a campaign against the recall at the same time that hundreds of pieces of legislation will be landing on his desk, expect the governor to reach out to liberal interests who will work to get out the anti-recall vote in October, critics said. <br>
<br>
'SIGNING BILLS LEFT AND RIGHT'<br>
&quot;He's going to be signing bills left and right to build a coalition to save him,&quot; said Phil Paule, political director for Rescue California, the lead group that supports the recall. <br>
<br>
Paule noted that Davis had recently announced he would support legislation allowing illegal immigrants to obtain California driver's licenses. It's a bill the governor vetoed last year; that rejection angered Democratic Latino lawmakers, who in turn publicly said they would not back Davis' re-election. <br>
<br>
This year, many agree Davis needs all of his allies to show up at the polls and vote against the recall. <br>
<br>
A Davis spokesman insisted the governor had signed Leno's bill because he thought it was good anti-discrimination legislation. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is the most gay-friendly governor California has ever had,&quot; said Russell Lopez. &quot;Add this to the long list of gay and lesbian issues he has supported.&quot; <br>
<br>
Lopez denied there were any recall-related discussions about how to inform the public of the new law, saying Davis was extremely busy and didn't have time to do a larger media push touting the signing. <br>
<br>
OPPONENTS TO SPEAK OUT<br>
That will be challenged today at a Sacramento news conference about the legislation by the anti-gay group Campaign for California Families. <br>
<br>
&quot;Gray Davis tried to hide his actions by signing this radical sex-change bill under cover of the budget, but he won't get away with it,&quot; said the group's executive director, Randy Thomasson. <br>
<br>
Gay-rights activists said they were too pleased with the new law to worry about how the governor presented his decision. <br>
<br>
And whether gay-rights groups invest time and money in helping save Davis' job may rely on a forthcoming decision. The biggest gay-rights measure this year is AB205, which would give gay partners many of the same rights as married couples. That bill will most likely move through the Legislature later this month and land on Davis' desk. <br>
<br>
&quot;That (Davis' signature on AB205) would certainly energize a lot of people, &quot; said Geoffrey Kors, executive director of Equality California, the state's largest gay advocacy and lobbying group.  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:fuchsia;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:x-small;">....·´¨¨))</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:small;">-:¦:-</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:teal;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:x-small;"> <br>

<br>
That's certainly true about the legislature... Right now we're held completely by Democrats, and they've been in a spending frenzy like never before. AND, for the first time, since we joined the union, more people left the state that joined.. AND many of those joining did it illegally.<br>
<br>
&lt;Every state is in the same boat as California, when it comes to the budget.&gt;<br>
<br>
Except for the fact that our deficit is larger than ALL the other state's combined. We've been downgraded again.. our status is only one step above junkbonds... we're on a fast track to bankruptcy.<br>
