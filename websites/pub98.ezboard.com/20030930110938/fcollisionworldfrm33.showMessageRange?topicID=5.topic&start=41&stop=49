I sighed, a bit aggitated. ((Feel like I'm only here to be used for battle...)) I raised my hand lightly towards the oncoming force. Zil grabbed the stunned Nina and pulled her into a decent perimeter of me and Fearix. <br>
<br>
&quot;Silence wall.&quot; I said the command calmly as a shield activated and deflected the blow. Leon smirked and clapped in a good-manner fashion. I waved my fingers to the side as the shield dropped with a 'I could care less' expression on my face. My dark energy shield was starting to break even more as my fist shook. ((I don't need other bounty hunters on my tail now. Damn Rianchrist for putting that on my head...)) I adjusted, double checking that it covered my face. Nina's calm, smug composture took over as she cocked a brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;A Sorceress?&quot; She asked bluntly. I glanced at her, answering,<br>
<br>
&quot;Fallen Angel.&quot; She gave a puzzled look as I turned my attention back to Mr. Show Off. ((Always fighting. When will I be able to live a 'normal' life? -_-)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninainhertz>Nina Inhertz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/3/03 12:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Haha, you bastard! You can't fire me! &gt;_&lt;</span><hr size=1> Nina blinked, her daze momentarily passing. She did her best to keep a collected composure, even though she was deeply enraged underneath that smug grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;A Sorceress?&quot; she asks of Hotaru bluntly, as if making casual conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fallen Angel,&quot; the immortal replies nonchalantly.<br>
<br>
Nina shrugs, turning her attention to Leon with a scowl. &quot;Listen you!&quot; she cries, waving her katana at the man, &quot;you can't fire me! You asked me to do a job and I'm going to do it, goddammit!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't I make myself, clear??&quot; Leon reiterrates, a hint of agitation in his voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;No! You said you'd help me if I did this job!&quot; Nina replies in desperation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=silverwill>SilverWill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/3/03 8:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ha!

<br>
&quot;I say a lot of things, sweety. Besides, you obviously aren't doing much of a-&quot;<br>
<br>
His words are stifled and replaced by a choking sound. Leon grips his head as if suffering from a massive migraine. With his free hand he sends another force at the group. It is smaller and faster but the group still dodges it. The force hits a tree, bursting it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Have... to kill... you...&quot;<br>
<br>
The pain becomes worse and he kneels on the ground. He bends down in agony and six long, green feathers are revealed on the back of his head. They retract slowly and eventually disappear. Leon releases his head and holds the grass beneath him, breathing hard.<br>
<br>
The crowd looks at him confused. Hotaru tries to approach him but Leon springs up and shifts into a defensive stance. His right leg is bent and held close to him, ready to fend off any attack. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know who the hell any of you are but you better keep the hell away from me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nina realizes that the group's weapons are aimed at him. &quot;Hey, you attacked us first!&quot;<br>
<br>
Leon looks as if he has had an epiphany. <br>
<br>
&quot;No... It's starting too soon!&quot; he whispers.<br>
<br>
Leon glances at the group one last time and leaps into the night sky, right over the hospital, right next to the limousine. He opens the door and gets in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Henry! How long have I been out?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir! You're back! Thank goodness... About 10 days.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NO! Ugh! I'm losing control.&quot;<br>
<br>
Henry looks disappointed by the news. His employer is splayed on the back seat, rubbing the ridge of his nose. &quot;Should I drive you home?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. I'm expecting company. You might want to go get some coffee while I take care of it.&quot;<br>

((Why do they all have to run away?)) I shrugged it off and put my thoughts into more important things. ((This damn shield I have to keep up is pissing me off.)) I gave a confused look as I watched Nina sheath her weapon and started to head in the guy's direction.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where you off to?&quot; I asked, not amused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Give you one guess-&quot; Zil stepped in front of her, Uzi planted firmly into Nina's forehead.<br>
<br>
&quot;First, Answers.&quot; I sighed and cracked my neck. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tootles.&quot; I commented as I gave a slight formal bow then headed in the direction where I parked my bike. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hotaru!&quot; Fearix grabbed my shoulder. My vision shifted into a black, purple static as I heard a yell of pain from behind. I blinked twice as I turned halfway around. Fearix winced an eye as he sat up as a little spark of dark energy flickered off the shoulder he grabbed. &quot;What's..wrong...with you damn it-&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Let her go, Fearix. Give her a minute to herself without biting her head off.&quot; Zil cut him off. I glared at him then glanced up at the other two who were staring. I turned my back to them and kept moving. ((My control is going bezerk...ugh This gift; my curse...)) I sighed and walked over to my bike. I glanced at the limo without much care then at it's driver. The driver left the car as it's ocupant came out.

Catching sight of Hotaru, he glares, flips her off, and mutters &quot;stuck-up bi-&quot; before shutting the door and curling up for a nap.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whoever they are, I can't seem to avoid them.&quot;<br>

The mysterious stranger had been an old friend of Zil's with a tendancy to overdo practical jokes.  And she was sure Hotaru, Nina, and Fearix hadn't been thrilled with Leon's attack earlier, but they would just have to get over that.  <br>
Realizing that Hotaru might 'run into' Leon again, Zil lowered her weapon and casually walked down the street 'til she saw Hotaru, glaring at the limo, debating her next move.  <br>
&quot;Relax 'Taru.  Old friend.  I'll chat with him.  Cya at the casino or something later...&quot;  <br>
Before the startled and now confused Hotaru could utter another word, Zil tapped on the car door before opening it and stepping in.<br>

A gust of &quot;awkward-momentness&quot; wind tosses her unkempt hair in front of her eyes.<br>
<br>
She sighs heavily, shrugs, and shakes her head nonchalantly, replacing that fleeting facade of dissapointment with a bemused smirk. &quot;What is it with these people and gambling?&quot; she asks herself, as she had the slightest hunch she wasn't going to get a definitive reply from the two recently dejected vampires.<br>
<br>
With newfound amusement, she slings her katana over her shoulder starts off in the direction of the sunrise . . .<br>
this scene was getting too old, its not good to dwell in the moment . . .<br>
<br>
On the other hand, she was seriously considering satiating an urge for poker . . . or just a chance to see that cutie with the open shirt again? (Ha . .  ^_~)<br>
