Author’s Note: This sixth story is based on Sami’s challenge.  As usual, the requirements will be listed at the end.  I would like to say that I think you guys are really going to get a kick out of this one. *smile*  This takes place a few weeks after the last story left off.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk watched on thoughtfully as Lionel entered the Luthor castle.  After some deliberation, he decided that an alliance with someone that Clark wouldn’t automatically disregard might be in order, and he was looking at the magnificent bastard right now.  The scene was set; all Mr. Mxyzptlk had to do was wait and see whether or not Lionel would take the bait.<br>
<br>
“Son?” Lionel called out half-heartedly before entering Lex’s empty office.  It was the middle of the night, so he didn’t expect Lex to be there, but it never hurt to make sure.  He smirked to himself as he made his way over to the desk.  “Quite underhanded of you to steal the Tanaka Taro account away from me, Lex.  But I’m sure I can find a way to ---”<br>
<br>
Lionel stopped talking to himself when he caught sight of a picture on his oldest son’s desk.  He fingered the 8 x 10 inch frame, lifting it to bring it closer to him so he could make sure he wasn’t just seeing things.  It was a picture of Lex in a lilac-colored bunny costume standing next to a beautiful young blonde woman who was holding a red-haired baby girl in her arms.  <br>
<br>
He blinked a couple of times in complete surprise.  There was no question in his mind that the little girl in the picture was Lex’s daughter, as she looked achingly similar to how his dead wife Lillian looked when she was a baby.  But, why hadn’t Lex told him?<br>
<br>
True, their relationship was strained at best, but he felt a strange tightening around his heard at the thought that his own son distrusted and detested him so much as to not tell him that he was now a grandfather.  He set the picture back down on the desk and set off in the direction of his son’s bedroom.<br>
<br>
Lionel opened the door without knocking and glared at Lex’s sleeping form from across the room.  He cleared his throat loudly, but Lex showed no response.  Lionel pursed his lips and stepped closer to the bed.  His eyes widened for a second at the wedding picture of his son and the blonde woman from the picture in the office.  <br>
<br>
Not only had Lex not told him that he had a daughter, but he hadn’t told him that he had done what Lionel considered the responsible thing and married the girl’s mother after he found out that the baby was his.  Lionel looked questioningly down at Lex, who was still blissfully unaware of his father’s presence in the room.  The thing that struck him was that Lex was sleeping in the bed alone.  He knew that Lex had a poor history with relationships, but to drive away his wife and child?  It was unacceptable.<br>
<br>
“Lex,” Lionel said in what was practically a yell.  Lex’s eyes fluttered open and he squinted at his dad as he tried to make out who was standing in his darkened room in the middle of the night.<br>
<br>
“Dad?” Lex asked, pushing himself up to a sitting position.  “What are you doing here?  What time is it?”<br>
<br>
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Lionel asked accusingly and with a touch of hurt lining his voice.  “I know our relationship isn’t what you had hoped for, but to not tell me that I have a granddaughter ---”<br>
<br>
“What?” Lex asked in sleepy confusion.  “I ---”<br>
<br>
A light knock came against the open door, accompanied by the sound of a crying baby.  Lex looked over to see the older woman he had previously called Agnes holding Lena in her arms.  Lena’s crying went to a full-pitched screaming and tears poured down her cheeks.  Suddenly realizing that it wasn’t a dream, Lex snapped to attention and slid out of his bed, clad only in his pajama pants, to walk over to her.<br>
<br>
“I’m so sorry, Mr. Luthor,” Agnes said.  “But she ---”<br>
<br>
“It’s alright, Agnes,” Lex interrupted and took the wailing baby away from her nanny.  “It’s okay, Lena.  Shhh.”  He bounced slightly with her in his arms but she refused to calm down.  “What do you want, sweetheart?  Hmm?”  <br>
<br>
The baby sniffed and barely managed to blubber out one word.<br>
<br>
“Mama.”<br>
<br>
Lex half-snorted in amusement.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, join the club,” he said under his breath.  Lionel arched an eyebrow at him and Lex let out a sigh.  His dad just had to pick now to visit, right in the middle of when an imp was playing tricks on everyone in town.  There was no reasonable explanation that Lex could give him that Lionel would even begin to believe and it frustrated Lex to no end.  <br>
<br>
Lena scrunched up her face as the moonlight and the light from the hallway lit up Lionel’s face.  Her eyes grew wide and she sniffled again as she stopped crying.  She leaned forward in Lex’s arms and held her hands out in Lionel’s direction.<br>
<br>
“Gam-pa!” she said excitedly.  Lionel’s eyebrows rose in surprise and a partial giggle erupted from Lena’s lips.  “Gam-pa, Gam-pa!” she repeated.<br>
<br>
“I ---”<br>
<br>
“You want Grandpa?” Lex asked with a small smirk on his face.  ‘Good,’ he thought.  ‘This will keep him occupied while I call Chloe and get her over here to help me come up with a story.’  Lex flicked on the lights and then walked over to Lionel, holding Lena out for his father to take from him.<br>
<br>
“Gam-pa,” Lena said again, a bright smile on her face as she clapped her hands together.  <br>
<br>
“I ---” Lionel trailed off again as the little girl lunged from her father’s arms into his.  She rubbed her runny nose against his and then gave him a drool-filled kiss on his lips.  Lionel made a face and Lena started laughing with delight at the expression.  <br>
<br>
She snuggled in closer to him, eyeing him the whole time and letting out spurts of giggling.  Lionel wasn’t sure what he was feeling.  Pride, certainly.  Amazement, definitely.  Love?  Lionel cleared his throat and looked down at the little girl who seemed fascinated by his hair.<br>
<br>
“And what’s your name?” he asked.  <br>
<br>
“Gam-pa,” she answered.  The corners of Lionel’s mouth lifted into a small smile.<br>
<br>
“No, that’s my name,” he replied.  Lena started laughing again and Lionel’s smile grew wider.  She stopped laughing and gave him a look he knew only too well from Lex and Lucas.  Mischievous.  He arched an eyebrow at her and she twisted her tiny fist into the back of his hair and gave it a hard pull.  Lionel yelped in pain and Lena started cracking up.  <br>
<br>
Lex walked over and smirked at his dad’s reaction to Lena.  He leaned down slightly to match Lena’s eye level and then smiled at her.  <br>
<br>
“Mommy’s on her way over,” he said.  Lena’s green eyes lit up and her smile beamed across her face.  <br>
<br>
“Mama!” she yelled.  Lex nodded.<br>
<br>
“Mama,” he said in agreement, placing his hands on her sides to take her away from Lionel.  Once she was in his arms, he smiled down at her and tweaked her nose with his thumb.  Lena snuggled against his chest and he kissed the top of her head, ignoring the look that Lionel was giving him.<br>
<br>
“Son,” Lionel started quietly, noticing that despite the fact that Lex was sleeping alone he was still wearing his wedding ring.  “Why didn’t you tell me?”  Lex glanced at him and then turned his eyes back to Lena.<br>
<br>
“It’s hard to explain, Dad,” he said.  Lionel scoffed.<br>
<br>
“How hard can it be?  You were involved with a woman and at some point one of you broke it off, she had your child, and you did the right thing by marrying her,” he said.  “I’m hurt that you didn’t feel you could tell me, and I’m concerned that your wife is no longer living under the same roof as you.”  Lex stared blankly at him and then shook his head.<br>
<br>
“It’s a long story,” he said.  “And it’ll have to wait for tomorrow when I’m more awake.”  Lionel frowned but nodded.<br>
<br>
“Alright.”<br>
<br>
“Lex?!” Chloe yelled from downstairs.  Lex grinned at his daughter and then walked out the door to go meet Chloe.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” he greeted from the top of the staircase.  Chloe gave him a flustered look as she smiled and practically ran up the stairs.<br>
<br>
“Mama!”<br>
<br>
Lex handed Lena over to Chloe, who hugged her tight against her and kissed her forehead.<br>
<br>
“How did you get here so fast?”<br>
<br>
“I’m not sure,” she answered and shook her head lightly.  “One minute I was getting into the car and the next ---”<br>
<br>
“Ah,” Lex said in understanding.  “Transportation was courtesy of our little friend.”<br>
<br>
“Since Lena’s here, that would definitely be my guess,” Chloe agreed.  Lex looked down at the baby girl when Chloe mentioned her name and saw that she was finally drifting off to sleep as Chloe stroked her head lovingly with her hand.<br>
<br>
“We might have a problem.”<br>
<br>
“Besides for having a baby that we don’t really have?” Chloe asked with a lopsided smile.  <br>
<br>
“My father’s in town.”<br>
<br>
“Uh-oh.”<br>
<br>
“Mmm,” Lex hummed in agreement.<br>
<br>
“So ---”<br>
<br>
“He thinks we’re married and that you’ve moved out or something,” Lex said.  “I didn’t catch all of it because I was half-asleep when he started rambling.”<br>
<br>
“Well, don’t worry about it,” Chloe said and switched Lena over to rest on her other arm.  “We can tell him the truth tomorrow – not that he’ll believe us, but it’s the thought that counts.”  Her left hand went up to stroke the baby’s red hair and Lex’s eyes were drawn to the large diamond ring and wedding band on her ring finger.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe,” he said.  She looked up at him and he motioned to her hand with his head.  Chloe’s eyes grew large with the sight and then her gaze darted over to him.  He held up his left hand and her mouth opened slightly when she saw the wedding band on his finger.<br>
<br>
“You remember how to pronounce that guy’s name?” she asked in a slightly panicked voice.  Lex shook his head.  “Crap.”<br>

He kept his eyes on Lex and Chloe until he noticed his granddaughter’s nanny coming his way.  He grinned to himself.  Servants were highly observant and could be valuable sources of information if the price was right.<br>
<br>
“Agnes,” he greeted quietly as she walked by him.  The older woman gave him a nod of her head and a kind look.<br>
<br>
“Mr. Luthor,” she replied.  He started to walk with her, giving her a smile as he did so.  <br>
<br>
“If you don’t mind, I’d like to see my granddaughter put to bed.  I so rarely get to see her,” he said, hoping to play upon whatever sympathy the woman had within her.<br>
<br>
“Of course, sir.”<br>
<br>
When they had walked far enough away from Lex and Chloe, Lionel decided it was time for the thinly veiled questioning to begin; but Agnes beat him to the punch.<br>
<br>
“I’m so glad that your son called Mrs. Luthor back to the house,” she said.  “It just hasn’t seemed the same without her here.”<br>
<br>
“Yes,” Lionel said in agreement, trying not to sound too conspicuous.  “Where was she?”  Agnes let out a displeased huff.<br>
<br>
“She’s been seeing after a sick friend, but between you and me, I think that Clark Kent has ulterior motives,” she said quietly and in a gossipy manner.  “I mean, what kind of man takes a woman away from her husband and child to take care of him while he’s sick, especially when he’s fully grown and capable of taking care of him of himself?  Not to mention the fact that his parents will be back in town tomorrow night?”  She tsked and shook her head as they entered Lena’s nursery.  <br>
<br>
“What is it that you think he’s trying to do?” Lionel asked.  Agnes rolled her eyes and lay the baby down in her crib, covering her with a small blanket.<br>
<br>
“Trying to win her back of course,” she replied.  “Not that he ever had her to begin with, and even if he had, Chloe – Mrs. Luthor - isn’t the kind of woman who would ever leave her husband – not ever.”<br>
<br>
“Of course not,” Lionel said consolingly, seeing that the woman was getting a little worked up about the situation.  Agnes shook her head again as they left the room and she closed the door behind her.  Lionel followed her a few steps down the hallway before speaking again.  “It would seem as though I have an apology to make to my son.”  Agnes raised an eyebrow, well aware that the elder Luthor never apologized to anyone.<br>
<br>
“You should wait until tomorrow, because you know how those two are” she started as casually as she could.  “Like rabbits.  I’m surprised she’s not pregnant with their second child already.”  Lionel’s eyebrows rose, but the woman didn’t notice as her eyes were focused on the hallway in front of her.  She came to a stop at her bedroom door and gave him a polite, yet curt nod.  “Good night, Mr. Luthor.”<br>
<br>
“Good night,” he said and took a few steps back in the direction they had just come from.<br>
<br>
“Mr. Luthor?” she called out.  Lionel turned back around and looked at her questioningly.  “Since you’re in town, are you going to want to spend part of the day with Lena tomorrow?”<br>
<br>
Lionel’s mind quickly flitted through what he had heard since he had arrived there and landed on the memory of Lex taking his daughter out of her nanny’s hands.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>‘It’s okay, Lena.  Shhh.’</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
One corner of Lionel’s mouth turned upward and he nodded at Agnes.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I think that would be lovely,” he answered.  Agnes nodded knowingly but then gave him a strange look.<br>
<br>
“Alright, but just to warn you ahead of time – she’s teething and has a nasty temper because of it.”<br>
<br>
Lionel barely resisted snorting.  He sincerely doubted that his granddaughter’s temper had anything to do with teasing, but more likely had to do with her genes.  He simply nodded at the woman and turned back around to walk down the hall.  <br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk watched on invisibly through the whole thing and a wide smirk played upon his lips.  Getting Lionel to become so attached to his granddaughter that he wouldn’t want to give her up was going to be easier than he had anticipated.<br>
<br>
The next morning, Chloe woke up, stretching her body against the silk sheets of Lex’s bed.  She furrowed her brow until she looked around the room and her memories from the previous night came rushing back to her.  She rolled over onto her side to see that Lex was no longer in the bed and she frowned.  The least he could have done after the whole Lena surprise and then convincing her to stay the night so they could make love was to be there when she woke up.  She sighed and shook her head, letting the covers unveil her body as she climbed out of bed.<br>
<br>
She glanced around the room and saw that the clothes that had been strewn so haphazardly about the night before were now completely gone.  She ran a hand through her hair and her mouth dropped open ever so slightly.<br>
<br>
“You’ve gotta be kidding me,” she mumbled to herself.  <br>
<br>
Lex leaned against the door frame that led to his private bathroom, watching Chloe search in vain for her clothing.  <br>
<br>
“Going somewhere, *Mrs. Luthor*?” he asked somewhat teasingly, making sure to emphasize the last part of his question.  She whipped around to see him smirking at her, only a towel tied around his waist and his skin still a little damp from the shower he had just taken.<br>
<br>
“Not if I can’t find my clothes,” she retorted with a terse smile.  Lex’s face fell and he stepped toward her.<br>
<br>
“What’s wrong?”<br>
<br>
“Where would you like me to start?”<br>
<br>
“Chloe ---” he reached out for her, but she dodged his hand and shot him a warning look.<br>
<br>
“Not only do you call me in the middle of the night, waking me up from the very little sleep that I actually get, to tell me that our non-existent daughter is back; but then you talk me into *staying* with you,” she said in an upset tone, “which I can’t *believe* I did – and then you’re not even here when I wake up!”  She motioned wildly with her hands and then took a deep breath.  “Where are my clothes?”<br>
<br>
“You’re not leaving,” Lex said with a light chuckle.  Chloe’s eyes widened as she looked at him and he placed his hands on her shoulders.  “I’m sorry I wasn’t in bed when you woke up, but you looked…cute…just sleeping there…and I didn’t want to wake you up.”<br>
<br>
“Oh.”<br>
<br>
“You want the shower?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah,” Chloe said almost absently and started walking toward the bathroom.  She stopped and turned around with a suspicious look on her face.  “Where *are* my clothes?”  Lex shrugged and smiled.<br>
<br>
“If you mean the ones from last night, then I have no idea,” he said.  “But our flying friend has apparently seen fit to provide you with closet space.”  He motioned toward the walk-in closet and Chloe arched a questioning eyebrow.  He walked over and opened the doors, pointing to what was seemingly her half of the closet, complete with several designer outfits in her size.  <br>
<br>
“Wow.”<br>
<br>
“Go take your shower,” Lex said and gave her a half-smile.  “I’ll keep my dad occupied for as long as I can.”  Chloe’s eyes grew wide in panic.<br>
<br>
“Your dad?” she asked.  Lex winced a little and his face held an apologetic expression.<br>
<br>
“He wants to spend the day with you, me, and Lena – something about getting to know his daughter-in-law and his granddaughter.”<br>
<br>
“Please tell me you’re joking.”<br>
<br>
“Sorry.”<br>
<br>
“Well, what about Lucas?  If this is supposed to be some familial bonding thing, shouldn’t he be there too?” Chloe asked somewhat irritably.  She watched Lex cough into his hand to cover the laugh that erupted from his mouth.<br>
<br>
“The doctors that treated his broken arm put him under a month-long psych evaluation since he was telling wild tales of a little floating man and how punching Clark’s stomach fractured his arm,” he replied.  Chloe couldn’t help the small chuckle that shook her body.<br>
<br>
“Oh, man,” she said, “that’s so mean.”<br>
<br>
“Karma’s a bitch,” Lex said with no hint of sympathy in his voice.  <br>
<br>
“Karma?” Chloe asked skeptically.  Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
“It serves him right for trying to take you away from me.”<br>
<br>
“So, basically his situation had nothing to do with karma and everything to do with you paying off the hospital employees?” she countered.  <br>
<br>
“Not everything,” he argued.  “They did want to give him a 24 hour psych eval, I just *convinced* them that it should be a little longer given that mental instability runs on his mom’s side of the family.”  Chloe laughed and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“You’re evil.”<br>
<br>
“You haven’t spent time with my dad yet.”<br>
<br>
“Nor do I want to,” she said in a bit of a grumble.<br>
<br>
“I can’t blame you, but I don’t think you’ll have much of a choice since he already talked to your dad.”<br>
<br>
“What?!”<br>
<br>
“Next time you leave the house in the middle of the night, you should probably get someone *other* than Lana to cover for you,” Lex said.  Chloe groaned.<br>
<br>
“Lana told him where I was?” she asked, more to herself than to Lex.  “I’m so going to kill her.”<br>
<br>

Thanks for calling and telling me about it.”  Lana arched an eyebrow at him.<br>
<br>
“If I didn’t know you any better, then I’d say you were just sticking around to see Gabe blow up at Lex, rather than give Chloe moral support,” she said.  He smiled impishly at her.<br>
<br>
“Yep,” he answered.  Lana rolled her eyes and shook her head at him.<br>
<br>
“You know that they have no control over what’s happened.  It’s all Babu’s fault.”<br>
<br>
“Babu?”<br>
<br>
“Uh, okay – that’s not his real name, but it’s the genie name he gave me and it’s easier to pronounce, so I’m using it,” she said.  Pete snickered.  <br>
<br>
“Just don’t let Clark catch you saying it,” he said.  Lana looked confused, so Pete decided to elaborate.  “He’ll get jealous.”  Lana frowned.  “Uh-oh.  Trouble in paradise already?”  Lana let out a suffered sigh.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know, Pete,” she said sadly.  “I thought that knowing Clark’s secret would help things between us, but he’s just as withdrawn as ever.”  He gave her a hint of a smile.<br>
<br>
“I hate to break it to you, but that’s the way most of us are,” he said.  Lana chuckled in amusement.  “Seriously.  Most guys aren’t in to talking about feelings and stuff.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but you do,” she pointed out.<br>
<br>
“Only because I’ve had years of being whipped into shape by having Chloe as a best friend.”<br>
<br>
“Hmm,” Lana said thoughtfully and then smiled.  “I’ll have to thank her for that.”  <br>
<br>
“Hey, hey, hey,” he said, wagging and then pointing his finger at her.  “No making fun.  I’ll have you know that particular skill has gotten me many a date.”  Lana’s smile grew wider.<br>
<br>
“And here I thought you were a ladies’ man because you’re just so cute,” she said and reached over to pinch his cheek.  <br>
<br>
“That too,” he said with a slight blush rising to his cheeks.  “What can I say?” he asked and thumped his chest proudly.  “I’m the complete package.”  Lana giggled loudly, but it died the second she saw who was coming in.  <br>
<br>
She flashed an uneasy smile at Chloe as she walked in the Talon’s front door, followed by Lex carrying Lena with a stuffed dragon in her arms, and then Lionel.  Pete turned around to see what Lana was looking at and he grinned when he saw the baby in Lex’s arms.  He turned back around and beamed a quick, mischievous smile at Lana before lowering himself from the stool.<br>
<br>
“Well, it’s been real Lana, but if you’ll excuse me, I have a best friend who needs teasing.”<br>
<br>
“Pete,” Lana said warningly.  He playfully waggled his eyebrows at her and made his way over to the table where Chloe and the Luthor entourage had joined Gabe.<br>
<br>
“Hey guys,” he said a little too cheerfully.  Lex glared at him, but Chloe smiled at the fact that Pete didn’t look like he was going to try and kill Lex for what was happening.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” she greeted back.  Lena smiled brightly and held her arms out from where she was perched on her father’s lap.<br>
<br>
“Pee,” she squealed.  Pete gave the baby a tight smile as Lex snickered at his daughter’s pronunciation of Pete’s name.<br>
<br>
“Hey monkey,” Pete replied.  Chloe slapped his arm.<br>
<br>
“Lena is not a monkey!” she berated him with a smile.  Pete tilted his head to the side and smiled again.<br>
<br>
“Please.  You have her hair all done up like those cartoon monkeys – damn.  What were they called?” <br>
<br>
Chloe and Lex exchanged a look and shrugged, and Lionel simply looked furious that the boy in front of him was referring to his granddaughter as a primate.<br>
<br>
“Young man, if you ---”<br>
<br>
“Monchichis,” Gabe interrupted almost absently.  Chloe and Lex both blinked.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“The Monchichis,” he repeated, looking up at Pete.  “I think it’s the cartoon you were referring to.”  Pete’s smile seemed to consume his face and he nodded giddily.<br>
<br>
“Yup.  That’s it.  My brother’s girlfriend collects those stupid little dolls and even has a couple of the episodes on tape,” he said.  “Weird.”<br>
<br>
“Well, I guess that’s where the ‘monchichi’ nickname came from,” Chloe whispered to Lex.  He nodded in agreement and grinned at her.  Gabe frowned as he saw Lex and Chloe smile at each other.<br>
<br>
“Chloe, could I speak to you for a minute?” he asked, scooting his chair back, already knowing what her answer would be.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah, sure,” she answered, scooting her own chair back as well.  “Excuse us,” she said to Lex, Lionel, and Pete.  <br>
<br>
“Look, I know what Lana told me,” Gabe said quietly after they made it to a far corner of the room, “but I’d like to hear it from you.”<br>
<br>
“What did Lana tell you?” Chloe asked.  Gabe ran a hand through his hair and his gaze flipped over to the table before turning to Chloe again.  <br>
<br>
“She said that something – someone – I don’t even know how to say this, it sounds so ridiculous,” he said.  Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Tell me about it,” she said.  <br>
<br>
“But she said, whoever this guy is, he’s responsible for everything weird that’s been happening in the past few months.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, that sounds about right.”<br>
<br>
“So – you and Lex ---?” he asked, leaving the question dangling at the end.  Chloe winced and gave him a nervous smile.<br>
<br>
“Going out, but not married.”<br>
<br>
“And the baby?”<br>
<br>
“Lena,” Chloe said.  “The – um – guy kind of zapped her here a while ago but kept taking her away.  Lex called last night and told me that she was back, that’s why I went over there.”  <br>
<br>
“Uh-huh,” Gabe said, not entirely convinced.  Chloe sighed.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, Dad.  I just don’t know what else to tell you.  It’s not like I know why this is happening either,” she said, bringing her hand up to sweep some loose strands of hair behind her ear.  Gabe’s mouth opened slightly at the sight of the ring on her finger.  Chloe noticed what he was staring at and she let out a humorless chuckle.  “Uh, yeah.  That was kind of there when I appeared over at Lex’s last night.”  Gabe frowned and Chloe gave him an apologetic look.  “Dad ---” He held up his hand and shook his head.<br>
<br>
“No, no,” he said.  “It’s okay.  This is probably my fault anyway.”<br>
<br>
“How do you figure?”<br>
<br>
“Well ---”<br>
<br>
“Lena – NO!” Pete’s voice yelled.  Chloe and Gabe turned their heads to see Lena laughing in delight after apparently throwing her stuffed dragon at the back of Lana’s head.  Lionel scowled at Pete.<br>
<br>
“I’ll thank you not to reprimand my granddaughter, Mr. Ross,” he said, taking the giggling girl away from her father and into his own arms.  Pete opened his mouth to speak but Lex gave him a warning look and shook his head ever so slightly.<br>
<br>
“We should get back,” Chloe said.  Gabe nodded.<br>
<br>
“She’s got quite an arm,” he commented with a smirk as he folded his arms across his chest.  Chloe couldn’t help the snicker that escaped her lips, but it turned to a gasp as she watched Lena’s stuffed dragon start to grow.<br>
<br>
“Uh, Dad?” she said to get his attention.  “We need to get out of here.”<br>
<br>
“What?  But I ---” he trailed off as he saw what she was staring at.  “Right.”<br>
<br>
Lex took Lena out of Lionel’s arms and motioned to Chloe to leave the building.  <br>
<br>
“Would someone like to explain what is --- dear lord,” Lionel said as he watched the stuffed dragon crash through the top of the building as it grew larger and larger, faster and faster.  <br>
<br>
The dragon let out a ferocious growl and then snarled down at Lana.<br>
<br>
“Oh, no,” she said, waving her hands in front of her face.  “Not again.”  Pete motioned for her to hide behind him, but the dragon snorted in amusement at the action.<br>
<br>
“Mxyzptlk!  Mxyzptlk!” Lena cheered happily, clapping her hands with glee.  The dragon looked in Lena’s direction and actually seemed to smile at her before turning its attention back to where Lana was huddling behind Pete.  <br>
<br>
It ducked its head down, baring its large, drool covered teeth as it sneered at Pete and Lana.  In the blink of an eye, it darted its tongue out and wrapped around the two friends, bringing them into its mouth and swallowing them whole.  Chloe’s eyes grew wide and her mouth was hanging open.<br>
<br>
“Oh, God,” she said under her breath.<br>
<br>
“Mxyzptlk!” Lena cheered again, her arms high in the air as she laughed wildly.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe?” Gabe asked quietly.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah?”<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry I ever doubted you.”<br>

<br>
“Long story, Dad,” Lex answered shortly to the unspoken question.  He turned to Chloe and held Lena out to her.  “Take her home, I’ll ---” Chloe took the baby girl, but scoffed at what Lex was about to say.<br>
<br>
“Oh, no,” she argued.  “You stay, *we* stay.  Besides, Lena’s the only one who can pronounce his name.”  <br>
<br>
“Good point,” Lex conceded.  <br>
<br>
“Well, if you won’t take my grandchild out of harm’s way,” Lionel started and stepped toward Chloe, arms poised to take Lena away from her.  <br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, Lionel found himself unable to move anything but his head and everyone around him completely frozen in place, including the dragon.  <br>
<br>
“Ah, ah, ah,” Mr. Mxyzptlk’s voice chided and then the imp appeared in between Lionel and Chloe, waving his finger back and forth scoldingly.  “I’m the only one allowed to do *that* disappearing trick.”  He snapped his fingers and Lena vanished.  Lionel’s eyes grew wide.  <br>
<br>
“I demand to know what’s going on.  Who – what – are you and what have you done with ---”<br>
<br>
“*I* am Mr. Mxyzptlk,” he interrupted, poofing his chest out.  “Everything you’re seeing is because of me – including Lena.”  Lionel scoffed.<br>
<br>
“I hardly think you ---”<br>
<br>
“How else would you have been able to see your granddaughter before she’s actually been conceived?” Mr. Mxyzptlk asked.  <br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“Oh – that’s right – they didn’t tell you, did they?  Not that you would have believed them anyway, but one would think a *little* honesty might not be too much to ask.”  Mr. Mxyzptlk smirked at the confusion on Lionel’s face; sure that it was an expression that most people never got to see on him.  “Okay, here’s the deal.  Your son,” he said and motioned to Lex with his head, “not really married to Chloe – not yet anyway – which means no baby Lena since she won’t be conceived until after they get married.”<br>
<br>
“But ---”<br>
<br>
“I know, I know – you saw her,” Mr. Mxyzptlk cut in again.  “Why does everyone in this dimension have such a hard time with things that don’t exist in this time?”<br>
<br>
“What do you want?” Lionel asked.  “If you are indeed the one responsible for all this, you must have a reason for doing it.  What do you want?”<br>
<br>
A broad grin spread across Mr. Mxyzptlk’s lips.  <br>
<br>
“You’re the only other one who knows that Clark Kent is an alien,” he said.<br>
<br>
“Lex knows.  He was there when ---”<br>
<br>
“Actually, he thinks that the bumbling boy wonder is another meteor mutant, much like --- too many of those damn people in this town – I should have done my research before coming back in time.”<br>
<br>
“You ---”<br>
<br>
“Yes, yes,” Mr. Mxyzptlk said with a wave of his hand.  “From the future, different dimension, the laws of physics don’t apply to me.  What you really want to know is how *you* fit into the picture.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t suppose you’re planning on telling me anytime soon?”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk laughed at the discomfort in Lionel’s voice and snapped his fingers.  Lionel found that he was able to move again and he stretched his arms out just barely enough to be effective.  <br>
<br>
“I need you to help me expose Clark Kent – or rather, have him expose himself,” Mr. Mxyzptlk said.  Lionel’s eyebrow arched at the last part of the sentence and Mr. Mxyzptlk rolled his eyes dramatically.  “Is every Luthor’s mind always in the gutter?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t see why you would need my assistance, Mr. ---”<br>
<br>
“Mxyzptlk,” he filled in.  “And the problem is that he’s figured out that it’s me who’s causing all the sudden torment in his life.  Normally I would be flattered, but he’s taken it too far and has started to opt out of my little game.”  Mr. Mxyzptlk motioned to the area outside hardware store across the street, where Clark was frozen in place just like everyone else.  “There – you see?  He was in there the whole time when Lena’s little dragon came to life and swallowed his friends, and he didn’t once come to try and rescue them.  He knows he would have to use his powers and he doesn’t want to risk further exposure.  Plus, he knows that his friends will be just fine at the end, just like they always are.”<br>
<br>
“Perhaps you’ve considered this already, but it seems as though your solution is simple,” Lionel started.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” Mr. Mxyzptlk agreed, “you join me.  Clark will think the more ‘realistic’ things are due to something else – namely you – and will let his guard down a little more.”  He stopped and rubbed his hands together evilly.  “And then, *then* we will *really* start having fun.”<br>
<br>
“Or you could simply stop returning his friends back safely,” Lionel pointed out in a somewhat condescending tone.  Mr. Mxyzptlk looked surprised.  He knew the man was evil, but he hadn’t expected him to say that.<br>
<br>
“But ---”<br>
<br>
“Now then,” Lionel said, adjusting one of the cuffs on his shirt before meeting Mr. Mxyzptlk’s eyes head on with a threatening glare, “I highly recommend that you bring my granddaughter back here.”  Mr. Mxyzptlk felt a smile start twitching at the corners of his mouth.  <br>
<br>
“Not until you agree to help me,” he said.<br>
<br>
“I already --- fine,” Lionel said, unwilling to put anymore effort into the conversation.  “If I help you get Clark to admit that he’s an alien, will you bring my grandchild back?”  He watched as a solid smirk took over the imp’s lips.<br>
<br>
“Already on its way,” he said in a cryptic voice and then added, “Just not the way you think.”  He snapped his fingers again and vanished.  Lionel blinked as everyone around him became animated again and the dragon disappeared from sight.  <br>
<br>
Chloe frowned as she looked down into her empty arms and then at the bare ring finger on her left hand.  Her eyes started to well up with unshed tears and she felt Lex’s hand on her back and his warm lips against her temple.<br>
<br>
“I’ll give you one he can’t take away,” he half-whispered, not bothering to explain whether he meant the ring or the baby.  Chloe leaned against him, but her gaze went to the now untouched Talon, and her gut twisted into a knot when she realized that Pete and Lana weren’t there.  <br>
<br>
“He can take anything away,” Chloe said quietly, letting a single tear slip down her cheek.  <br>
<br>
“Hey,” Clark greeted, suddenly appearing behind them.  “I caught the last part of our little friend’s newest thing.  So, where are Pete and Lana?”  Chloe’s hands bunched into tiny fists as she quickly swiveled around and glared at him.<br>
<br>
“You *caught* it?” she asked menacingly.  “You mean you saw what he did to them and you didn’t even *try* to come and help?!”<br>
<br>
“I ---”<br>
<br>
“Damn it, Clark!  They’re *gone*!” she yelled, her voice pent up with anger and grief.  “And it’s *your* fault!”<br>
<br>
“What?” Clark squeaked out.  <br>
<br>
“That little floating guy – Mr. ---” she stopped and shook her head, “The only reason he’s here is because of *you* and you don’t have the decency to come and save your friends.  The jig is up - everyone knows you’re wall of weird material, Clark.  But instead you decide to try and keep your secret instead of helping them.  And now --- now my daughter is gone again too,” she said in a choked voice.  “All because you didn’t want to play his stupid game.”  She took a breath and then buried her head against Lex’s chest.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe,” Clark started in an almost pleading voice.  “You wouldn’t have been ready to have her around all the time anyway.”  He paused when Lex and Lionel both shot him icy glares that sent a shiver through his body.  “You know I’m right.  You still have to graduate and what would you have done?  Actually gotten married to Lex?  We all know that the only reason you’re going out with him is because ---”<br>
<br>
Lex loosened his grip on her waist, meaning to hit Clark himself, but Chloe beat him to it.  She took a couple of steps toward Clark and then kicked his shin hard.  Clark’s eyes widened with surprise when the kick actually hurt – a lot.  He yelped and bended down to rub it, looking up at Chloe’s trembling lips and pointed finger.<br>
<br>
“If you do anything, and I mean *anything* to have Lena taken away from me again, you will know what pain *really* feels like,” she said.  Clark nodded almost absently, still surprised that Chloe had been able to hurt him – and without a hint of kryptonite in sight.  <br>
<br>
“He’ll bring them back,” Clark said, his voice betraying the doubt he felt.  “Pete and Lana - *and* Lena eventually – they’re alright.  I know they are.  He’s never hurt them before.”<br>
<br>
“Maybe you should go find him and make sure,” Lex said coldly.  Clark nodded again, his eyes trying to catch Chloe’s to give her an unspoken apology.  <br>
<br>
“I’ll bring them back, Chloe,” he said.  He turned around, but found he couldn’t use his super speed due to the throbbing in his leg.  Instead, he walked as briskly as he could to his dad’s truck and sped off in it.  Lex looked down at Chloe.<br>
<br>
“You hurt him.”<br>
<br>
“Good.”<br>
<br>
“I mean it – he’s practically invincible and you managed to hurt him with a well-placed kick to the shin.  How did you do that?” Lex asked.  Chloe took in a breath and then released it, unsure of what to tell the man next to her.  Gabe stepped up beside her, his hands in his pockets as he stared straight in front of him.<br>
<br>
“That reminds me – your mom called.”<br>
