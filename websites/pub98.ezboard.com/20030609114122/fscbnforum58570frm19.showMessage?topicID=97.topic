<br>
The six ghouls didn't know who exactly it was that they'd been sent to dispose of. The previous night, their master had stated simply that the target was a vampire, and that the strike needed to be done during the day if it was to succeed. An address was given, weaponry was distributed, and the mission began.<br>
<br>
For weeks they'd been training in urban combat procedures, prepared to face other ghouls in a shootout that would inevitably result in their victory and the destruction of their target, but as they surrounded the small cabin near the top of Mount Diablo, there was a disturbing silence. If the vampire was here, wouldn't his ghoul protectors be patrolling? Wouldn't at least one be visible in the daylight? Maybe this was some kind of trap.<br>
<br>
But they were prepared for that situation.<br>
<br>
There was a 1974 Dodge Dart parked in front of the cabin, the exact car they'd been told to look out for. A quick look at the license plate confirmed their suspicions. The target was either here, or very, very close by. <br>
<br>
A quick search of the perimeter revealed nothing. No one. Maybe he was alone. That would make things easier. The ghouls got themselves into position and waited for the signal...<br>
<br>
...and it was given.<br>
<br>
Three ghouls kicked in the front door, while the other three forced their way in through the back. As luck would have it, the cabin was simply one large room, with a kitchen and two doors. One undoubtedly led to the bathroom, while the other would lead to a bedroom. Their target would be in that bedroom.<br>
<br>
Both doors were smashed to the ground. The bathroom was ignored, and in less than a minute, six ghouls surrounded a bed in which an unmoving lump lay covered by blankets.<br>
<br>
If they'd been paying attention, they would have seen the electronic eye on the wall to their right blink red for only a second.<br>
<br>
The ghouls prepared themselves to strike. One moved to pull back the covers. Two more equipped themselves with stakes and stood next to the bed. The remaining ghouls trained their firearms on the bed, prepared for any sudden attacks. The ghoul at the head of the bed grabbed the corner of the blanket and silently mouthed a countdown from three...<br>
<br>
Two...<br>
<br>
One...<br>
<br>
The six ghouls stared in shock at what they saw. A group of pillows lined up to present the illusion of a human body, and in the center of the simple shape they formed was a small shoebox. On the lid of the box was a simple post-it note.<br>
<br>
     Screw you!<br>
<br>
          Love,<br>
            Vicious<br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
Vicious walked slowly up the path to the cabin. As anticipated, Ryan had tracked Vicious to Portland and undoubtedly asked around as to where he'd gone to. Vicious had made sure to leave false information as to his destination before he left to throw Ryan off the trail. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Annoying fuck</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Vicious thought to himself as he checked his car for damage. A few paint scratches, but nothing serious. He turned his attention to the burnt-out husk of the cabin, smirked, and walked in through the front door. Vicious wasn't surprised by the presence of charred, dead bodies. Ryan wasn't the type to come after a person himself. He was a lover, not a fighter. Just like last time, he'd sent a group of ghouls into a trap. Except that this trap was more efficient and didn't involve battery acid.<br>
<br>
It took Vicious three hours to sift through the wreckage and remove all evidence of a bomb. He'd already opened the gas main the night before, and although the fuel had already run out, the authorities didn't need to know that. He lit a match, let it burn down a bit, blackened the rest with his lighter, and tossed it carelessly onto the bed. Gathering up the various weaponry lying around the room he headed out and returned to his car.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oops. I almost forgot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dropping the weapons in the back and opening the trunk, he stared coldly at the young couple who'd been in the cabin when he'd first arrived. The girl, a pretty blonde, couldn't have been older than 19, while the man, who had a light german accent, was at least in his mid twenties. He dragged them out, waking them in the process.<br>
<br>
&quot;Scream, yell, anything, and what I'll do to you will make death seem like a happy little painkiller.&quot;<br>
<br>
He ripped the duct tape off their mouths and stood up, smiling broadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;So! What d'ya think I should do with you two, eh? I figure it's only a matter of time before blondie's friends and family come lookin' for her.&quot; Vicious moved so he could see them both.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, the problem here is that, well, you've seen my face. And that's NEVER good. Nope. Nuh uh. Never. So do you two promise never to mention this to anyone?&quot; Vicious smiled as he said this, trying to look as friendly as possible.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I promise! Please don't hurt me!&quot; The girl moaned. The man simply nodded. Vicious smiled, happy to hear the news.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great! Let me just cut you loose then!&quot;<br>
<br>
He freed the girl and told her to run down the path. She complied.<br>
<br>
She got about 15 feet away before a pair of throwing knives hit her in the neck and the heart. Before the man on the ground could make a sound, Vicious was already standing with his boot on the man's throat, pressing just enough to make clear the man's fate if he made even a peep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, man. I don't get much practice on moving targets. I'll make sure she's disposed of in a manner that implicates you as the suspect, you dirty, lecherous, psychopatchic, homicidal bastard,&quot; he leaned over to look into the man's eyes, &quot;But for you, I've got a SPECIAL treat. It's been awhile since I've eaten German...&quot;<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
I apologize for the length of this. Once I start, I don't like to stop.<br>
