As I have posted the &quot;History on Angels,&quot; I shall post on the History of Demons and Devils.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
Let it be known that Demons and Devils are quite different.  Devils were first, demons were second.  The denizens of Hell are there for various reasons.  Hell was created as an after life prison.<br>
<br>
The Devils were there to act as guards in Hell.  From the lowest imp to the highest Pit Fiend, all devils are guards and all were there first.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
Demons were once angels.  After the first angelic war, all Angels who sought to claim equal status to Father, and all of their supporters, and those who were just as ambitious as those who sought to claim equal status to Father were banished to the Material Plane.  Everything was stripped from them.<br>
<br>
Wings, powers, status, recognition, weapons... the whole enchilada.  Once they were banished to the Material Plane, their ambitions took on darker forms.  Greed, lust, all of their ambitions over took them with a vengeance.  Let it be known that several high demons say &quot;God fucked up.&quot;  Let it be known however that that is hardly the case because Father never screws up.<br>
<br>
Because of the stronger desires that the fallen angels had, after they lived out their mortal lives, they went to Hell to pay for their crimes.  A transformation happened when they entered the burning gates of blood.  Those that had evil ambitions transformed into the figures we imagine today.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
Demonic scholars contend that there is an alliance between Demons and Devils.  Let it be known that in a sick sense, there is.<br>
<br>
After the second Angelic War, the one with Lucifer, the renegade angels and all beings who did not participate in that war were sent to Hell.  The angels that declared themselves as neutral and had sufficient status and recognition to get away with it were looked down on but not sent to Hell.<br>
<br>
Lucifer and Satan are not one and the same.  According to my sources, a deal was struck between the two.  Who betrayed whom first?  Your decide.  All that can be said is that Lucifer and Satan swabbed the decks with testosterone.  Lucifer was Demon, Satan was Devil.  Because of this fight, the Devils declared war on the Demons.  <br>
<br>
This is known as &quot;Hell's Civil War.&quot;  Both sides took heavy casualties.  Lucifer was killed by Satan.  Satan was mortally wounded by Lucifer and died about 2-3 years ago.<br>
<br>
Let it be known that there is still some order in Hell.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
Now we see the purpose of Hell, the difference between Demons and Devils, and how they each came to be.  But how did the Devils get there first?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
Devils got to Hell first because of their actions.  In Genesis it talks about the Eden, Adam, Eve, and the Tree with the Serpent.  Let it be known that those events are not accurate and were generally rewritten in order to keep the scene politically correct.  Let it also be known that the Bible hasn't changed much with each copy, except the wording.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
Getting back on track...  When the human race learned truth about their nakedness and were no longer ignorant, greed, lies, deceit and all of these things were given to the human race.  Murderers, rapists, politicians that were corrupt even then, when they died they went to Hell first.  Let it also be known that the more darker and eviller the soul, the higher status it gained.<br>
<br>
How other races got into the Burning Hells is beyond me, nor do I really care to know.  <br>
<br>
(On a side note it can be argued that there are actually three gods:  Good, Evil, Neutrality;  as a balance has to be maintained.)<br>
<br>
Ang so getting back on track again, those who were murderers, rapists, generally evil and dark beings who were beyond redemption, beyond saving and the like became the first Devils.<br>
<br>
As Father was given Heaven and the power to create, Satan was given Hell and the power to destroy.  Satan saw the more malevolent the soul was, the higher the status the soul got.  <br>
<br>
This happened for about the first 2000 years.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
By this time Heaven saw what was going on and has been waging it's war against Hell.  These skirmishes, combined with the few uprisings in Heaven, will become a full blown war.  This will be known as the &quot;Third Angelic War.&quot;  Let it be known that when this war happens, all angels, regardless of wing color, status, and recognition will have to choose a side.<br>
<br>
Let it also be known that there is a chance that Creation can be destroyed as well, and I'm not talking about the place &quot;Creation.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
Like Heaven, status and recognition exsist.  Just differently.<br>
<br>
There are seats of power at a big circular table.  The seats and the table are in what's known as &quot;The Hall of Eternal Darkness.&quot;  There are 13 seats in total.  A throne is in the middle, at the head of the table where Satan would sit.  But because of his death, the throne has been empty, even after all of these years.<br>
<br>
The closer to the throne, the more status the Devil has.  The more accomplishments gives recognition.  Only Devils are allowed to sit in the chairs.  Demons are allowed in the hall, but they are required to stand at the end of the table, and only one at a time.  This reason is for treachery.  It goes back to &quot;Hell's Civil War.&quot;<br>
<br>
Like I said, it is unclear as to whom betrayed whom first.  Sitting in the chairs are the 13 highest Devils in Hell.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
Satan's absence:  It has been confirmed that Satan is indeed dead.  2-3 years ago, the mortal wound gradually became critical.  Because of the natural distrust in Hell, several assassins help the wound claim the life, but not before they themselves were sent in exile to the &quot;Nether Realms.&quot;<br>
<br>
In Satan's absence, order has been maintained in Hell.  The two highest authorities in Hell have been fighting each other for the throne.  This includes battles between the two, battles against the angels, contests held, recognition going through the roof...<br>
<br>
Only the two Devils closest to the throne can fight for rulership.  Any one else faces extreme consequences.<br>
<br>

They need to be deleted.  <br>
<br>
Such knowledge is not to be discussed, nor are any ready to receive it.  There is hope though, since strangely enough 50% is accurate.<br>

So please, some mod, delete these threads, or delete the original posts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkickbanned.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mzpenguinz@kickbanned>MzPenguinz </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://fans.papervixen.net/penguins/image9thumb.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>American Hero</span><br>  Posts: 1253<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/30/03 11:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkickbannedfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=59.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: History of Demons and Devils</span><hr size=1> 50% of what is accurate?
