<br>
NORFORK -- Producers of a new TV fly-fishing series are looking for the most skilled anglers in America, and a Norfork fishing guide is in the running. <br>
<br>
Fishing guide John B. Gulley has been selected to compete in the southeast qualifier for the 2003 Fly Fishing Masters Tournament. The southeast qualifier will be Sept. 20-21 in Atlanta, Ga., for casting and Sept. 23-24 at Helen, Ga., for fishing. <br>
<br>
From the field of 200 fly-fishing teams in four regional casting competitions, 32 teams will advance to the fishing competition. Then, four regional teams will advance to the national finals at an undisclosed location in October. The four final teams will be judged and ranked first through fourth according to performance. <br>
<br>
The top ranked two-person team will receive a cash prize of $30,000, with the fourth ranking team winning $2,000. The tournament is being produced for incorporation into a new television series called &quot;Fly Fishing Masters&quot; for initial broadcast on the Outdoor Life Network, which is carried by Cox Communications in this area as Channel 61. <br>
<br>
Gulley is an award-winning fishing guide and conservationist. He was chosen by the Orvis company as &quot;Guide of the Year&quot; in 1998 and remains one of two Orvis-endorsed fly- fishing guides in Arkansas. <br>
<br>
Gulley, who has nearly 30 years' experience guiding on Ozark streams, was named Arkansas Water Conservationist of the Year in May by the Arkansas Wildlife Federation and other sponsors of the award. He operates his own fly-fishing service and instructs others in fly fishing. <br>

<br>
Although, Jason Borger knew who I was at the show which kinda freeked me out. I have a feeling that everyone will know Andrew's name after he casts at this thing. The more opportunity I have to see some of the best casters in the country the more I think Andrew may be the best of all of them. Or at least he &quot;could&quot; be. I have to say that Steve Rajeff is a &quot;VERY&quot; good caster as well as his brother Tim. I don't think they are heads and above Andrew though. Steve and I were talking about distance casting at the show. He pretty much felt that casting in excess of 130-140 with an 8 weight was a super human feat. I've seen Andrew do it with consistancy. <br>
<br>
Amazing....<br>

Historically, in fly fishing, &quot;they&quot; (whoever &quot;they&quot; are, but somehow it exists) don't let you be considered anything special, or a &quot;celebrity&quot;, or worthy of being well known, until you are older. Usually approaching, or in middle age. Sometimes older than that. This is a lot older than &quot;celebrities&quot; in any other sport. It's just the way it's been. There are few exceptions. Look, the &quot;top&quot; guy in fly fishing is in his mid or upper 70's. In baseball, at this age you're a relic. In football you don't even live that long to make any speeches. If you think about it though, as it stands now, this is a very cool sport for an old man. A unique situation in America, actually. But things on the fly fishing noteriety scene are ready to change some.<br>
<br>
     These new &quot;national&quot; competitions may be the driving, changing force. If they catch on, they will be. The people who'll win them and come close will be younger. Some much younger. They will start becoming the &quot;celebrities&quot; in the sport, alongside, I think, the older known guys. They won't &quot;push them aside&quot;, fly fishing's too traditional for this to happen. Anyway, it's one reason why good fishin young guys are getting into these things. It's virtually the only way they can become noticed, aside from if they are incredibly innovative, talented,  and truely head and shoulders in ability above everybody else as a fisherman. An example of this from yesteryear might be Stu Apte. There are few Stu Aptes in the history of the world. So you win competitions instead.<br>
<br>
       You'll also notice how few &quot;big names&quot; will take part in these things too. They know already that the very talented younger guys are going to win these things, and anyway it's just too big a risk for them (as they see it). See, they know they've had a pretty good thing going on, noteriety wise, for all these years. But no longer. No longer, that is, if the events catch on. This &quot;younger&quot; guy you mention, John, probably feels the same as the &quot;older&quot; ones, by the way. What they all may not realize is that they will still be no less noticed. It's just that the younger guys will be noticed as well. This is a wonderful and healthy change for fly fishing.  For note: the older &quot;celebs&quot; who do enter the competitions are to be given much credit, win or &quot;lose&quot;, they ARE special.<br>
        Think about it. Bass competitions already did this to bass fishing. Made the young guys &quot;stars&quot;. Before them it was the old &quot;geezers&quot; who knew &quot;how to get em&quot;.<br>
<br>
    So John and Andrew, or anybody, if you really are legitimately that good, it's simply just a matter of time. I don't mean thirtey years either. I mean a relatively short span. Looks like you were born at the right time.  Hey wait! Whose to say, actually. If you were here thirtey years before you were, maybe you'd be there already!<br>
<br>
     Best of luck this weekend guys!<br>

Heck I'm already past my prime. My distances slip farther down every year. Andrew might have a shot at it though. I looked over the 40 mile mark a couple of years ago. Andrew and I spent some time with Gully in Atlanta this year. He's a heck of a great guy. He is totally deserving of his name in the business as far as I'm concerned.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Welcome to the group. <br>
<br>
It's just sort of a trick shot. It's neat to watch someone who is one of the &quot;best&quot; at anything. Sort of like the fact that I enjoy watching you tie flies. It's not really about the fishing, it's more about seeing someone who is good at what they do.<br>
