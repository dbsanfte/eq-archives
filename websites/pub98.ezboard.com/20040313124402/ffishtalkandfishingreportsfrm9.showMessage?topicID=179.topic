Friend of mine from work invited me to come along.  We fished Randy's buddy's private lake in Perrysburg.  Probably 15 minutes from my house.  Randy used wigglers &amp; wax worms tipped on black and purple tear drops.  I used a gold tear drop and trout head with shrimpo combo on the other rod.  We started fishing a breakline that ranged from 10 to 15 foot of water.  Didn't get any bites there at all.  We moved deep from there and started catching some.  Chip(the owner) and Chris(friend of Chip's) also went out fishing on the ice with us.  We hooked up on some decent fish in 25 to 26 feet of water.  I'm not a very good deepwater ice angler, but it was a learning experience.  I managed 5 today.  4 good bluegills and one bass that went about 16 inches!  Randy out did us all catching 3/4 of his on wigglers.  He caught 2 jumbo Yellow Perch.  both were 12 to 12 1/2 inches in length.  He also caught 6 bluegill and one bass.  Chip and Chris didn't fair so well.  They went home empty handed.  It was pretty cold out there.  Single digits, and with the wind chill I would venture to say that it was double digit cold!  Fun day getting away not far from home.  Below are some pictures of the days catch &amp; Randy holding his Perch.  <br>
<br>
P.S.  Mike (mrm123).  Do you know the lake along 75 there in Perrysburg with the Pontoon boat parked there during the summer.  That's the place I fished today.  The owner tells me there's some monster bass in there.  Maybe I will be lucky enough to be invited to fish it again sometime this summer.   The owners were really nice folks.  <br>
Take care all, and have a great weekend.<br>

Let me know if you talk to some of those guys at the bay.  I would like to know if they are catching anything.  I had a friend stop by there 2 weekends ago.  He said he talked to the guys and no one had anything.  <br>
<br>
A buddy of mine and 5 of his friends fished the Findlay reservoir's Sunday.  Said they only caught one white bass all day long.  This was the guy that went fishing with me Saturday.  So I know it wasn't the fisherman.<br>
<br>
Also spoke with someone who said they fished La Su Ann's smaller lake with a couple guys.  They caught one small bass and one nice bluegill.  <br>
<br>
Heard of a guy catching 10 small perch out of the Delta reservoir, and one 3 lb. bass!  Wonder if that one is true.  Humm!  <br>
<br>
I'm planning on heading over to Evergreen sometime to do  some ice fishing.  So if you think you can brave the ice.  Give me a holler and I'll take you out there.  I don't have much time the next couple weeks for fishing, so it will be a quick trip when I do go.  I had a buddy go there last Sunday and he caught 3 crappie, and some small bluegills. <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">

There were plenty of gills if you wanted them but I wanted to fish for crappies in deeper water. Using the same setup kastmaster and ice jig tied 10&quot; below. I was fishing in 30 feet of water and finding fish at either 5 reels from the bottom or at 8 reels,most came at 8. I tipped the jig and kastmaster with a tiny piece of crappie fillet which seemed to enhance the catch. All in all about 40 crappie and 10 gills, most of the bigger crappies I gave to one of the other fishermen there.

<br>
John,  That's a interesting way to catch them.  I remember as a kid going out on Lake Erie with my Grandfather.  We would always cut off a piece of Perch belly and fish with it after the minnows were gone.  <br>
The funny thing about my trip Saturday was the two guys who didn't catch anything were fishing with a Ice Flasher.  It was picking up fish suspended in  12 to 14 foot of water.  Fished that depth and never got a bite while it was reading it.  All of our fish came within 2 to 3 foot from the bottom.  We couldn't get those suspended fish to bite.  The guys with the Flasher ended up getting nothing.  So you have to wonder if you should let a machine dictate how and where you fish.  Is it always better?  In this case it wasn't, because we were fishing for uncatchable fish, or were using something they didn't want at that depth.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for the report John, and congrats on all the fine crappie and gills you caught.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :thumpup --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif ALT=":thumpup"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">

Whats good about perch belly is it is tougher then crappie and you can cut it and give it a better shape then crappie. If you catch one take the belly fillet cut it up in thin slivers of 1/4 and 1/2&quot;s and what you have left after fishing put in some salt and store it in the frig and use that the next time out until you get some fresh belly. I find the fish one reel at a time coming up from the bottom.Bass601/John <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfishtalkandfishingreports.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bigbass101>Bigbass101</A></span><br> Posts: 924<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/4/04 2:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffishtalkandfishingreportsfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=179.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: perch belly</span><hr size=1> Good tips John.  thanks. <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">
