<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Why it was wrong to prosecute man for growing medicinal marijuana</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
By Sherry F. Colb<br>
FindLaw Columnist<br>
Special to CNN.com<br>
Wednesday, February 12, 2003 Posted: 1:45 PM EST (1845 GMT)<br>
<br>
(FindLaw) -- Last month, a federal jury in California convicted Ed Rosenthal of marijuana cultivation and conspiracy charges. Rosenthal will now face a minimum of five years behind bars for his actions. Theoretically, he could even be sentenced to life imprisonment. <br>
<br>
People are convicted of drug offenses every day, of course. But several factors distinguished this case from others. <br>
First, Ed Rosenthal grew marijuana for sick and dying patients. Second, Rosenthal acted as an agent of Oakland, California's program to dispense marijuana to people whose doctors have prescribed it. Third, California's Proposition 215 expressly authorized the program. <br>
<br>
At Rosenthal's trial, the defense sought to tell the jury these facts, but the judge ruled them inadmissible. As a result, Rosenthal was convicted by a jury whose members believed he was an ordinary marijuana grower. <br>
<br>
Following the verdict, upon learning the truth, several jurors called for a new trial. Horrified by what they had done, they felt they had been misled into making a terrible mistake. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>A Supreme Court ruling says even medical marijuana violates federal law</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I previously have argued that providing relief to suffering patients should qualify as a common law defense to federal drug charges. In an opinion by Justice Thomas in the case of United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative, however, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected such arguments. <br>
<br>
In that case, a cooperative that dispensed marijuana to sick people was seeking a declaratory judgment stating that their activities were legal. Though they lost the case, no one was sent to prison. <br>
<br>
The decision, however, brought the war on drugs to a new front. A battle that was once waged on unscrupulous dealers would now come to those attempting to alleviate the agony of extremely and terminally ill individuals. <br>
<br>
Because marijuana can combat nausea, it is an invaluable treatment for AIDS sufferers losing dangerous amounts of weight, and for cancer patients experiencing nausea induced by chemotherapy. After the Supreme Court's decision in Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative, helping such people could trigger federal prosecution. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Expecting federal prosecutors to look the other way</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Warned that their activities violated federal law, California officials and citizens – including Ed Rosenthal – nonetheless persisted in doing what they thought was right. Perhaps they reasoned that even if federal narcotics laws technically prohibited what they were doing, they could count on the Justice Department to exercise its discretion wisely. <br>
<br>
They might have hoped that, having made its point that the laws indeed apply, the Department would still use its resources to go after the kind of drug dealing that can blight neighborhoods and go hand in hand with violence. <br>
Rosenthal, after all, did not participate in the global drug trade, either by buying drugs of unknown origin from dealers or by selling them to the general population. Moreover, because his actions were regulated, like the actions of the alcohol industry after the end of Prohibition, they were not linked to the violence and mayhem of illegal drug trafficking. <br>
<br>
In trusting federal prosecutors to leave them alone, however, Ed Rosenthal and others made a serious miscalculation. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Federal supremacy: Here and elsewhere</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Rather than look the other way, Attorney General Ashcroft and his Justice Department have chosen to pursue Ed Rosenthal for openly flouting the dictates of federal law. Under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, federal law trumps state law whenever the two conflict. <br>
<br>
For the federal government to insist that all citizens in every state adhere to federal law is not inherently objectionable. Many states, for example, disagreed with the U.S. Supreme Court's view of segregation in Brown v. Board of Ed. Indeed, the phrase &quot;state's rights&quot; became a synonym for racism and segregation in part because states took the position that integration was a bad idea, regardless of how loudly a group of tyrannical federal judges insisted otherwise. <br>
<br>
Most of us believe, however, that when segregationists stood behind their beliefs with massive resistance, the federal government acted appropriately in crushing that resistance. It was doing what was necessary to ensure that African-American children could safely attend the same public schools as their white counterparts. <br>
<br>
The merits of the underlying dispute are therefore an inescapable part of any condemnation of the Rosenthal prosecution. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hypocrisy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Attorney General Ashcroft is nonetheless an easy target. He heads the Justice Department of an Administration that claims to value the sovereignty of states as well as the states' ability to embrace priorities that are distinct from those of the national government. In fact, the man who selected Ashcroft would not be in office were it not for an electoral approach that subordinates the will of the majority of the populace to the will of a group that more closely approximates the wishes of the states. <br>
<br>
When Ashcroft and the Bush Administration do not like what the states are doing, however, then their skepticism about federal supremacy seems to undergo a transformation. If California believes in medical marijuana, then California must be beaten into submission. Even if one does not accept the notion of a state's &quot;right,&quot; one can still point a finger at those who do and who nonetheless go ahead and violate that putative right. <br>
<br>
There's only so far the hypocrisy point can take us, however. Just because Ashcroft may be a hypocrite does not make the prosecution of Ed Rosenthal wrong. At best, it deprives Ashcroft of the moral standing to pursue it, leaving open the question of what a more principled attorney general ought to have done. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Beyond the merits</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There is something very troubling about the prosecution of Rosenthal, above and beyond the merits of the argument for a medical marijuana exception to narcotics laws. <br>
<br>
Consider a similar but fictional set of facts. Suppose that Compassionate Carl decides to grow marijuana for sick people in New Jersey because he believes that both federal and state laws are wrong. <br>
<br>
Carl feels strongly about what he does, just like Ed Rosenthal did, but Carl has no official authorization for his mission. In pursuing his agenda, however just and right, he engages in civil disobedience with his eyes open. He is as likely as any other drug-dealer to be charged with a crime. <br>
<br>
State or federal prosecutors could decide to go after Carl under such circumstances, because he chooses to disobey laws of which he disapproves. A person like Carl might be willing to disregard other laws as well, and such a person therefore poses a risk of general lawlessness. In addition, if Carl gets away with his crime, then others may infer that one need only obey laws of which one approves. <br>
<br>
Legal regulation works as a communal instrument of social control only if it compels compliance independent of any individual's views. <br>
<br>
The next civil disobedient to follow in Carl's footsteps, then, might choose a far less controversial set of prohibitions to violate, perhaps because he and others have developed contempt for law. There is thus something to be said for following the rules, even when a person is not a fan of a particular statute. <br>
<br>
Ed Rosenthal, however, did not simply choose to disobey the law. State officials specifically granted him permission to cultivate marijuana. In other words, whatever civil disobedience occurred was joined by the government of the state and the municipality, which might thus have appeared prepared to shield the individual from the wrath of the federal government. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What about segregation?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If we go back to the case of massive resistance to desegregation, we have another example of federal lawbreaking assisted by state officials. In spite of the states' involvement, however, most of us would not feel that the federal government was wrong to intervene. In fact, federal intervention became the only hope of children seeking equality in the classroom. <br>
<br>
Does the analogy to segregationists' massive resistance make the official recognition of Ed Rosenthal in California irrelevant? No. It only proves that if people are fighting for racial segregation, then they are engaged in activities that are so clearly wrong that the fight is benighted, regardless of who joins in. The fight against racial integration reflected and reinforced white supremacy. <br>
<br>
Unlike the segregationists, the state of California and the selected official medicinal marijuana-growers in that state are engaged in something whose worthiness of condemnation is far less clear. Even people who believe that illicit drugs exact a horrific physical and moral cost on their users, would not generally equate provision for medicinal with provision for recreational use. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>It all matters -- merits, hypocrisy, and state sanction</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
In considering the Rosenthal conviction, then, a number of factors turn out to be significant. First is the nature of the defendant's actions. Ed Rosenthal grew marijuana to relieve the suffering of sick people, and he harmed no one in the process. Second is the fact that he went to great lengths to ensure that his actions conformed to the law of California, by obtaining official authorization. And finally, the Administration that chose to prosecute Rosenthal was guilty, in so doing, of hypocrisy. <br>
<br>
Because California is not alone in singling out the medical use of marijuana for protection, the Justice Department has apparently decided to make an example of Ed Rosenthal. He is dangerous because he dissents from the Attorney General's position. <br>
<br>
Whether the issue is medicinal marijuana, our failure to execute enough people in the Northeast, or the legalization of physician-assisted suicide in Oregon, it seems, Ashcroft considers dissenters to be enemies of the State (or at least, of the federal government). <br>

The more I learn about the drug laws the more I can't believe how insane they are.  I can't believe how marijuana is treated compared to alcohol and tobacco.  Recently our PTA sponsored &quot;Red Ribbon Week&quot;, the &quot;just say no to drugs&quot; campaign.  The following week was the PTA meeting where they planned a dinner meeting for members, and they specifically ruled out restaraunts that didn't serve alcohol because some of the members wanted be sure to be able to have a drink with dinner.<br>
<br>
Uh, OK.<br>
<br>
I admit I have not followed the Ed Rosenthal case <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , that was interesting DBC.  I'll have to read up more about it, Ed seems like an interesting guy with an interesting history.<br>
<br>

&quot;I don't have very good soil so I used this book to teach me new ways to grow my weed. Thanks Man&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
OK, well seriously, I think the drug laws are kind of odd.  I'm not real big on the idea of smoking marijuana for recreational purposes but with what little I know about it, it doesn't seem to be hardley as bad as so many other things people are doing legally, including a few of my own bad eating habits <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  And the idea that it is being prosecuted when being used medicinally, seems to be as you put it, mindless.<br>

<br>
An estimated 56,606 felony cases were filed in the State courts of the Nation's 75 largest counties during May 1998 <br>
<br>
About a fourth of these felony defendants were charged with a violent offense, usually assault (12.2%) or robbery (6.1%). Those charged with murder (0.7%), rape (1.3%) accounted for a small percentage of defendants overall.. <br>
<br>
About three-fourths of defendants were charged with a nonviolent felony. The most frequently charged nonviolent offenses were drug trafficking (17.7%), other drug offenses (19.4%), theft (9.9%), and burglary (7.5%). <br>
<br>
About 3 in 8 defendants had an active criminal justice status at the time of the current charged offense, including 16% who were on probation, 14% on pretrial release, and 5% on parole. <br>
<br>
Fifty-two percent of all defendants were convicted of a felony, and 15% were convicted of a misdemeanor. <br>
<br>
The highest felony conviction rates were for defendants charged with a murder (68%), drug trafficking (66%), burglary (58%), a weapons offense (57%), or a driving related offense (56%).<br>
<br>
The lowest felony conviction rate was found among assault defendants (34%). <br>
<br>
Ninety-six percent of convictions occurring within 1 year of arrest were obtained through a guilty plea. About 3 in 4 guilty pleas were to a felony. <br>
<br>
Murder defendants (28%) were the most likely to have their case adjudicated by trial. Seventy-seven percent of all trials resulted in a guilty verdict.<br>
<br>
Overall, 68% of the defendants whose most serious conviction charge was a felony were sentenced to incarceration. Nearly all of the remaining convicted defendants received a probation sentence. <br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
The most frequently charged nonviolent offenses were drug trafficking (17.7%), other drug offenses (19.4%) = 37.1%; 56,606 felony cases were filed <br>
