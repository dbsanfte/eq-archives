Well, after reading Bucks review I just had to play this game. What is it about crappy reviews of games that are supposed to save of from wasting our time that makes us go out and play these games anyways. I don't know but My thumbs are hurting now because of it. You really have to tap the fire button a lot in this one and it is no short game. I was crazy enough to actually beat this game. Did you Buck? If so then I have a new found respect for you. Anyways, I did find a flaw in The Bucks review. He mentioned that there are 2 buttons that you use to play this game and he is most certainly wrong. I would say there is more like 4 buttons in this game. Friends, you will be putting in quarters and hitting the start button just as much as you would be pressing the other buttons in this game so I consider those buttons to be the extra 2. I dislike it very much when games are made such as this. It makes me wonder how it ever made it in an arcade. As I started out playing this game I thought &quot;hey, this isn't so bad&quot;. To describe it you can assume that the creaters were mixing drugs and tried to combine asteroids with centipede. Now, this game came out in 1988 and apparently the designers were very lazy. The game took minimal effort by the looks of it. With games in 88 coming out like robocop, ninja gaiden, and tetris, You would expect much more from a game like this one. If you think the game will change from the first level it won't. The game stays the same and I mean as in creatures you fight, the stuff they use to shoot you and the end bosses. You will fight the same end boss about 10 times in this game and there are a total of 5 big bosses. Some you play several of them per round. The bosses are stupidly easy too. The waves of creatures before the boss is much tougher. Now, Unlike The Buck I didn't die until round 4. There I died once and the game was still somewhat fun. Not till round 7 did the game take a twist into stupidity. From there on you will die die die. each time you hit start you will flash invulnerable for a couple seconds. Get as many shots off as you can because those are the onlly ones you will get off before you die again. After that the game loses all points of a fun factor. considering that there are 23 levels in the game that is a lot of dying, button mashin, cursing, and whatnot. Some of the guns that you recieve in the game are kinda cool but unless you are within the first 7 rounds of the game you won't last long enough to really get to use it. The controls are very bad. It would have been much better if they used a dial insted of a button and direction combo to change the direction in which you face. There are 2 &quot;super stages&quot; in the game Every single object in the round leaves a trail on the board till your screen looks like a swirl of paint (or something you puked up) At first I though &quot;OK this is kinda neat&quot; but soon realized that it causes great confusion and disarray. The stages are stage 16 and the last stage 23. Very dumb idea. The ending to the game sucked as well. It said the oddest thing. something about Boys need games to survive and if there are no games then we can do anything else. Don't think I typed that incorrectly. It sounds like some words are misplaced or something but I think thats what it said. I think it was the wierdest ending I have ever seen. Then it says &quot;here is the game info: &quot; then it shows technical info about the game. Resolution, refresh rates, pixels, really wierd stuff. THen at the bottom it said Have a nice day. How very very strange this was. After that the game starts over at stage 1 but it is named Stage 23. I had enough at stage 7 but I played till stage 25.<br>
Heres how I rate this one.<br>
Controls: 2<br>
Fun Factor: 2<br>
Replay factor: 1<br>
Overall: 1.5<br>
This game gets the wierdest ending award.<br>

after reading what jack wrote i had to go back and play it - this time till i beat it- took me 43mins give or take to beat this game, with a score of 218,300, in reply to his not dieing till lv 7 i dont blive this , yes the game isnt that hard in the start hell over all but to not die till then it a little to long if you ask me --- so i offer you this THE EDITORs CHALLANGE--- ( you must play in front of me and not die till lv7). i also fail to see the 4 bottons i hit everything and still only 2 bottons <br>

What did you think of the ending? and about the 4 button thing i was trying to say that putting quarters in and hitting the start button are like 2 other buttons in the game cause u hit them so often.

The LAN brings many games and what kinda gaming party is complete without a little MAME? Well, to fulfill this requirement me and Jeremy hopped on and played a few. The game that we did defeat was none other than arcade classic <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://roms.mame.dk/png/captaven.png" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> Captain America and the Avengers! Simply put this game is awesome and anybody that has ever played it knows this. Iron Man is always my favorite in this game and it seemed that Jeremys was Capt. America himself. This game is your typical side scroller with 4 selectable characters. Iron Man, Vision, Capt. America, and Hawkeye. There are two buttons that control the game which are attack and jump. When pressed together it releases a strong attack and if you hold them both down you will hold up a shield character dependent. The shield I found to be useless because the best defense is a good offense. The stages bosses are fairly easy till you reach the end of the game and even then they don't get too hard but this doesn't take away from the game at all. Afterall, I am sure that a couple avengers can take down any one of these villians so if anything they just made it realistic. If there had to be a problem with the game it would have to be the flying segments of the game in which there are 2. These parts require lots of button mashing and can get tireing pushing the buttons so fast for so long but these segments are short and this still isn't much of a setback. One of the most incredible parts of this game is the ending. After a hard fought battle and many quarters gone to arcade heaven it is really nice to see a little show for all of your hard work. Far too often have I beaten a MAME game and been disappointed by the ending. Well the ending for this game was one of the longest and best endings I have seen. Truely wonderful and very appreciated. <br>
To sum it all up heres how it scored on my charts.<br>
Controls: 9<br>
Fun Factor: 9<br>
Replay Factor: 10<br>
Overall: 9.5<br>
The replay factor is way up there because I don't know how many time I have beaten this game and who knows how many more times I will defeat it. This game gets the Editors Amazing Ending Award. <br>

tho never played it on Mame i have on the Sega and the real Arcade, this game is truly fun but not desing of the 9s it got, youre prob asking youself &quot;why?&quot;. The reason why is becuase this they used 2nd rate villains most of the time ( Ultron being the best out of them) and 2nd string Avengers (save Cap and Tin Head) i know i will get flamed for this but as cool as Hake-Eye and Vision are they were 2nd stringers back then i would have loved to seen Thor and Quicksliver as playable chars. this game is fun and worht some coinage.<br>
<br>
fun factor:    7 out 10<br>
replay factor 7 out  10<br>

If there is a reason that I haven't posted a review in a while its because I have been playing MAME! Well, there are a bunch of great new games out there as MAME has released a new version since last review. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://roms.mame.dk/emu/mame32v67b.zip" target="top">Get it here!</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> I guess it is only fitting to review a game from the .67 set so here goes. This issues game is <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://roms.mame.dk/png/gaiapols.png" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->. Immediatly looking at this game it looks like an old gauntlet game. To tell you the truth it plays a lot like it too. Kinda a mix between The origional gauntlet and the new gauntlet legends. The Buck and I started out playing this game and I thought it was rather cool. Justin picked some freakish beastly Character and I pick the guy with the sword. I guess thats prolly how it would be in real life for us (hehe jk Buck). Anyways, The game has very basic controls which I found to be a little too basic to my liking. There are 3 buttons. Slash, creature attack, and special weapon. The slash is very simple but you can hold down the button to use your shield and you can also do a dash attack whick comes in handy. By swinging the D-Pad you preform a circle attack. you can pick up friends along the way and they will attack for you until you die. Last attack is when u pick up blue spheres. You get a special attack! It will change and become more powerful and last linger the more spheres you get before you use it. There really isn't much of a difference between each character <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But the game remains entertaining. Too bad the cutscenes weren't in English. They were cool. A great feature in games like this is the ability to level up. You can get stronger and collect better weapons however I feel that they kinda missed the point. THe game allows you to keep a password so that you can resume later with your buffed up character but the game isn't long enough for any of these features to really be worth it. Granted this is an older game and granted I am not pumping in quarters to play this game but even still I do believe that with some different attacks and a much longer game this game could have been amazing. Instead I think it just inspired and paved the way for other games to incorperate these essentials. So I still give a bravo. The music was also very good. <br>
Heres how it pans out<br>
Controls: 7<br>
Fun Factor: 7<br>
Replay Factor: 6<br>
Overall: 6.5<br>
With just a little more of the right stuff this game could be an 8<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
it was a fun game but it gets played out fast, lvs are all the same as are the enemys, none thing to special about the atts they are diff from other games , and the cut sceens were a nice add-on. heres my ratings<br>
<br>
controls:7<br>
fun factor: 7 ( then it lowers as the game goes on)<br>
