<br>
Oct. 5, 2002 will go down in the country's sports history as the Ateneo Blue Eagles finally ended their 14-year title drought and became the champions in the Universities' Athletic Association of the Phillipines &lt;UAAP&gt; Men's Senior Basketball. Everybody cheered for them as if we all share the dream. They were hailed as heroes and became instant celebrities.<br>
<br>
From a group of young men just trying to do their own thing and playing what is supposed to be just a game to a pandemonium that even the not so interested ones are now becoming fanatics. Now, their faces seem so familiar as you can see them almost everywhere, magazines, television shows/series, and not to mention those billboards we see on highways, and to think that it's been months since tha big day occured.<br>
<br>
But even with all the fame that came along with their triumph, these guys remain to have a clear view of the whole picture, and that their studies is far more important than any of these. And yeah, did i fail to mention that some of them are as much of a pet lover as they are of a basketball player?<br>
<br>
So if i mention Rich Alvarez, Paolo Bugia, Marco Benitez and Gec Chia I'm sure that you'll get excited and will want to know more what and who's behind those names. Well, I must be the envy of most girls now since I got a sneak peek on their lives, homes, hobbies... to sum it all up, their lives outside the hardcourt.<br>
<br>
Marco Benitez: The Soft-spoken player<br>
<br>
He's part of the champion team and is been playing for Ateneo for four years. Though after graduating with a BS Management Engineering degree, he's still doing the same thing only this time instead of playing, he's an assistant coach for the school's junior team.<br>
<br>
Marco always loved to have pets. They used to have fishes though no one seemed to know how to go take care of them. It's really dogs that they want, but since his mom isn't fond of them, he was hesistant to get one<br>
<br>
Two years ago, it was his younger brother who did convincing to their dad to get them a pet, and yes! The three siblings chose a Golden Retriever. Why not, the opportunity is already there, and what a better pet than a retriever. They got the dog from a friend who breeds dogs.<br>
<br>
They named the dog Twixie, it was a unanimous decision from them. If you ask Marco, the dog's intelligent. Since they only feed her dog with dog food and in the mornings, she goes to the kitchen because the maids give her two cookies. One time the maid deliberately gave her just a cookie, Twixie's not too sure whether to get the cookie because she's probably waiting for the other one.<br>
<br>
Taking care, of the dog isn't a problem. It's more than enough that the dog gets to recieve affection from three persons. Even with his busy schedule, Marco still finds time for their pet. Their quality time is at night . &quot;It's nice na meron medyo malambing when you go home. It's nice, comforting, it's like having another person in the house,&quot;said Marco. Instead of going straight to bed, he'd spare some time to play with Twixie.<br>
<br>
The dog's free to roam the house, but only when mommy isn't around. But as they say, she'll get used to it. Don't take it against her though, she's just afraid of dogs that's why.<br>
<br>
Though not like other pet owners, they do not pamper her with unnecesaary stuff. Sure, when it comes to all the things she needs, sky is the limit for her, like food, her regular trips to the vet and stuff like that. I guess the way they treat Twixie is a reflection of what kind of lifestyle Marco has.<br>
<br>
A lot of people may have misconceptions that he's one of the spoiled-brat kids who've got nothing better else to do but play basketball, and that the dog is just a symbol for status quo sake, just two things that Marco proved to me that day. They were not pampered as kids. Sometimes you have to work hard for some of the things that you want.<br>
<br>
With Twixie, &quot;we treat her just like another sibling that you have to look after and have to attend to someone you have to take care of especially when all of them &lt;his brother and sister&gt; are already grown up.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the future he wants to breed dogs too, maybe there'll be a lot of running little golden retrievers in the house but even with his passion for dogs , he admits that it didn't change his way of life. Why should it, &quot;we're used to looking after each other&quot;, referring to the way he treats his family, especially his brother and sister.<br>
<br>
It was just a brief meeting, but I can sense that Marco will not only be a better basketball player in the future, but with a heart like his, he has the qualities of a good man, and a good dog breeder someday. <br>
