<br>
Night fell upon Tir na Nog. Even as the moon approached its zenith, the streets still bustled with the life of a capital town. Every now and then, a cheer would escape this or that tavern. The guardians of the city changed shifts for the last hours of twilight, though they did not expect much to occur in the dead of night. A few crafters remained at the forge this eve, trying to finish their last orders of the day, or work on that favorite project, tirelessly honing their craft. The forges burned bright, casting shadows into every corner of the merchant’s bazaar. <br>
<br>
Shadows that served well as the home for the kindred shade. <br>
<br>
He remained deep within the alley, watching the late night crowd dwindling in number, watched as the city guards grew careless in their patrols, watched as the clouded sky covered the moon for longer periods of time. He would bide his time, he knew the inevitability of this night’s business. He thought it over again and again, trying to convince himself that he saw every angle, knew every action and repercussion, thought of every wrinkle that could develop in his plan. <br>
<br>
With a frustrated grunt, he shook his head clear of the thoughts. The choice had already been made; there was no turning back at this point. With new resolve, the shade moved through the back alleyways, finding little trouble in coming before the building he sought. <br>
<br>
The rogue guildhall looked exactly the same. Even with the business at hand weighing on his mind, the shade could not help but think briefly of the first time he infiltrated this guild headquarters. That time had been much easier, having sent in a decoy through the front, allowing him the chance to enter through a secret window, high above the merchant bazaar. He knew precautions had been put in place since that attack. He toyed with the thought of what another “distraction” from that vicious blademaiden could accomplish this night, but quickly dismissed such impractical thoughts. This was his battle, and his alone. The stakes were much higher this time around, as were the dangers held within. <br>
<br>
As the next cloud made its way over the face of the moon above, the shadow darted across the street, slipping in through the door, and calmly walked through the foyer room. He kept his cloak about his head, nodding as he passed the night guard within the hall. <br>
<br>
He made his way toward the stairs, but continued past. Upstairs was the room of the “guild boss”, at least, as the rest of the guild riffraff knew him as. The shadow knew the front for what it was, a protective shield for the darker secret held deeper within. He continued down the first hall, finding the very common looking spiral stairwell leading below the guild house’s street level structure. The shadow descended the stairs, emerging below to an empty room with one door before him. Knowing by now that he had no choice but to continue the course, he did not hesitate in the slightest as he walked towards it, reaching out to open the door. <br>
<br>
The door opened before his hand even touched the knob. <br>
<br>
Expecting nothing less, the shadow strode calmly into the chamber. The room before him was large and lit by candles from across the room. Sitting in a very comfortable looking throne was a particularly bored looking elf, her chin resting in one hand as she reclined against one side of the throne. <br>
<br>
“Poor, poor Saiioth,” she purred, “haven’t we been over this once already? Need I show you the futility of standing against me yet again?” <br>
<br>
The bored expression was replaced with one much more sinister, as her eyes focused much more sharply on the young elf before her. <br>
<br>
“It’s unfortunate that things will have to end this way,” she continued. “You showed a lot of promise, and yet your attempts at betrayal, though quaint and flattering at first, have now become a nuisance. I’m sure even you can realize how this must end, after your last pitiful display of deception.” <br>
<br>
She rose gracefully, regally, her robes flowing about her as she raised her staff before her, the first, and last, spell she needed to strike down this fool before her already on her lips. <br>
<br>
“Have you anything to say, foolish, pitiful, poor, poor Saiioth?” she purred again, “or will you admit your failure, your defeat, your pathetic insistence of seeking a death at my hands?” <br>
<br>
Saiioth glanced up from tugging absently at one of his gloves, infuriating the mage with the look of boredom sincerely on his own face. He raised his arms out; hands extended upward and shrugged, shaking his head from side to side, his gaze looking down once more as he sighed with remorse <br>
<br>
“I see your point. All things being equal, I can’t see how this can possibly turn out any different than our last meeting...” <br>
<br>
The young rogue’s head slowly rose, meeting the gaze of the elven mentalist. The mentalist had overwhelmed many foes before, savoring their look of despair, of terror, as the realization that their time of reckoning was upon them. So it was with a sincere anticipation that she waiting to see the look upon this worthless, brash, boastful young elf, to see him swallow his pride in the last few moments of his useless life. <br>
<br>
It was with sincere disappointment and seething hatred that that anticipation was replaced, as Saiioth smirked. <br>

<br>
Saiioth watched the sun rise, just as he had done every day for the past month. He sighed quietly, looking at his unused bed. Even though he had yet to remember, to glimpse the cause of his many sleepless nights, he knew it to be the same nightmare. Since returning to Tir na Nog one month ago, he had been plagued with restless nights and listless days, each brief moment between sleep and wakefulness leaving him with the same vague feeling. <br>
<br>
That feeling was one of pure terror, casting off any idea of returning to sleep. He could not remember upon waking what would cause such emotion, only that it was something to be feared, to be avoided. <br>
<br>
To be left alone. <br>
<br>
Saiioth stretched and decided to travel into the merchant bazaar today, just like every other day. He could not help but smirk as he looked down at the collection of herbs, incense, and sleeping potions he had already purchased, each and every one proven useless. The few merchants who dealt such novelties had come to know Saiioth, or more importantly, Saiioth’s money. They would surely have yet another miracle cure for him to try tonight. <br>
<br>
Saiioth found the city quiet this morning. A few craftsmen and merchants were about, setting up their businesses and chatting amongst themselves. He realized that it might be a few hours before many were open for business, so he decided to visit the tavern, in hopes of finding something fresh to eat this morning. <br>
<br>
As he turned the corner leading out of the merchant bazaar, Saiioth ran directing into a young man, knocking him down. <br>
<br>
The man looked up, a slow smile coming over his face. Glancing from side to side, he rose and leaned toward Saiioth. <br>
<br>
“Good morn to you, kind sir. Say, could you spare a few gold for a man who’s found a bit of poverty?” <br>
<br>
The man peered oddly into the rogue’s eyes, watching him closely. Saiioth felt a bit dazed, hazy from his lack of sleep and the shock of bumping into the man. Numbly, he reached down, untying the strings to his coin pouch. <br>
<br>
“Here now, no need for all the trouble, good sir. Why not just give me the whole pouch?” the man said, calmly, reaching out a hand towards the purse. <br>
<br>
Saiioth nodded, placing the pouch into the awaiting hand. Without another word, the man turned away, walking briskly to the nearest alleyway. <br>
<br>
Moments later, Saiioth shook his head and glanced down where his coin purse should be. He went over the events that just took place, replaying them again and again in his mind. Even with his lack of sleep, and haziness that suspiciously seemed to now be gone, Saiioth could only come to one conclusion. <br>
<br>
He had just been robbed. <br>
<br>
___________________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
Saiioth stood within the alley’s shadow, and watched the girl walk into the building just across the street. It had been the fourth thief he had watched accept a “donation” from an unsuspecting traveler, and the fourth thief who then returned to this building. <br>
<br>
Saiioth held a hand to his head, trying to think through his afternoon headache. They always came around this time, which normally found him lying awake in his bed with the curtains drawn. Instead, he was out in the city - the very bright city - trying to concentrate beyond the pain and make sense of what he was now seeing. <br>
<br>
The building was quite familiar to the rogue. He had personally exposed the guildmaster as a spy against Hibernia, ruining his reputation amongst thieves, and forcing him to flee from the authorities. By affiliation, the guildhall itself suffered, and was closed down shortly thereafter. <br>
<br>
Except that now, it appeared to be still operating. <br>
<br>
He looked up, hearing the door from the guildhall opening. Out stepped two very well equipped guards. They turned, heading directly for where he was hiding. Saiioth flinched, looking about to make sure that his location could not be spotted from that far away. Regardless of the implausibility of being discovered, Saiioth slinked back, turning to leave. <br>
<br>
He stopped short, staring in disbelief at the robed woman who stood calmly before him. With a disarming smile, she motioned towards the guildhall as the approaching guards escorted him inside. <br>
<br>
____________________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
Saiioth was brought into a large room, candles from across the other side providing light. There before him stood a woman, bent over a table reading various scrolls with interest. As he and his escort entered, she looked up. As she dismissed the guards with a wave, Saiioth studied his hostess. <br>
<br>
She was an elf, on the young side of middle age, though it appeared she had not lost much of her youthful looks. Her hair was white, but it retained its vibrant shine. She was dressed in very exquisite clothing, both expensive and comfortable looking. He noticed as well that although the guards had left, the robed woman who confronted him in the alley was still by the door. <br>
<br>
His hostess turned to regard him, an amused smile on her face. “Welcome, fair rogue, to my guildhall. I think you will find a few things have changed since you were last here.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth bowed, saying “I fear you have me at a disadvantage. For you obviously know who I am, and yet, I’ve never had the pleasure of your acquaintance.” <br>
<br>
The hostess nodded, seeming pleased. “I am Elzadaeli, guildmistress of this hall. How may I be of service?” <br>
<br>
Saiioth responded, “It seems one of your guildmembers had mistaken me for a common mark, and made off with my coin purse. I understand that this is what a thief does, so I will not insult you by asking for it to be returned. Instead, I will simply inform you that I will retrieve the amount owed me from the man himself.” <br>
<br>
As he finished speaking, the robed woman moved forward and handed Saiioth his coin purse. The rogue took it, conscious of the fact that it was quite heavier than when he parted with in. <br>
<br>
He bowed to the guildmistress, “Thank you, Guildmistress Elzadaeli, for this gesture of honor. Tell me, to what do I owe the excess coin?” <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli purred, “Perhaps I hope to gain favor with one as skilled as you, Master Saiioth. I have need for one of your talents, and would pay handsomely for them.” <br>
<br>
She raised a hand as Saiioth made to speak, “Come now, I have spent too much of your time already. Please, enjoy my hospitality, and we will discuss this more in the morning. I’ve your room prepared already, and I think you will find it to your liking.” <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli returned to the scrolls on the table before her, assuming the discussion was over. The robed woman bade Saiioth to follow her. She led him to his room, allowing him to refresh himself, and later brought him to the dining hall. <br>
<br>
Later that night, after a very good meal, Saiioth found himself alone at last in the guest room prepared for him. He lay back on the bed, exhausted from the long day’s activities, and closed his eyes. <br>
<br>
Saiioth’s eyes opened to the sound of birds chirping. With a start, he realized that the light pouring through the window was from the noonday sun. Subconsciously, he brought a hand to his head, slowly becoming aware of the lack of pain, of tiredness. <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli greeted him with a smile as he was led into her room later that afternoon. Her smile grew wider as Saiioth asked slyly, “So tell me, which of my talents you were interested in, exactly?” <br>

<br>
Saiioth sat in the commons room, enjoying his morning meal. The past months had been rather enjoyable, finding both a reprieve from his sleepless nights, as well as making a fair sum of money. He nodded to the friendly gestures of those coming in from a long night’s work, many of them looking up to the elf who had worked his way into a prominent position within the rogue guild so quickly. There was no animosity, no jealousy coming from those who worked for the guild. Everyone profited equally, regardless of their role, from those that worked the streets, those who smuggled supplies into the guildhall, even to Saiioth who had become Elzadaeli’s senior enforcer. <br>
<br>
He had to admit the respect he saw in each of their eyes was worth more than all the money he stood to make from this agreement. <br>
<br>
Saiioth smiled as he looked about the room. It didn’t take long for one to see just how effective a guild Elzadaeli ran. Street thieves and mentalists worked in tandem, befuddling their marks and walking away with full coin purses. Assassins and enchanters would stalk their prey, magically holding them in place for the perfect enchanted strike, only to elude detection by running away with enchanted speed. <br>
<br>
He glanced up at the woman who sat down at his table, idly reading a scroll of the day’s assignments. They had been assigned together since his first day at the guild, and had progressed quickly into becoming the most respected pair here. They were now the guild’s official “emissaries”, which was a fancy way of saying they made visits to those who didn’t see things the guild’s way to convince them otherwise. <br>
<br>
She normally wore plain brown traveling robes, like the ones she wore when she confronted Saiioth in the alleyway at their first meeting. He noted that she was wearing her audience robes today, quite radiant and charming. He was almost positive they had an enchantment about them to increase just that emotion. Her dark violet hair was pulled back and braided intricately. It was apparent they had an important visit to make today, as Saiioth knew the mentalist before him despised dressing up this much. <br>
<br>
He was about to ask as much, when a figure entered through the front door. At first, he was a little intrigued that such a young boy would be seen walking into a rogue’s guild, but something stirred within his heart, as recognition knocked quietly in the recesses of his mind. <br>
<br>
Kaejar. <br>
<br>
The little lurikeen boy walked through the room, apparently knowing where he was going, and looking every part of belonging there. Saiioth’s partner glanced up, a questioning look on her face as she noticed both the boy and Saiioth’s stare. <br>
<br>
“Something wrong, Saiioth?” <br>
<br>
“Huh? Oh, no…nothing. I just…thought I knew that boy.” <br>
<br>
The woman nodded, returning to her paperwork, “He’s fairly new here, but you might have seen him around I guess.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth shook his head, “No, that’s not it. I know that boy from my hometown. He’s from Ardee, but he’s no thief. There must be some mistake.” <br>
<br>
The mentalist looked up again, taking notice of Saiioth’s growing agitation. Putting aside the scroll in front of her, she asked him plainly, “Why is that?” <br>
<br>
“Because he’s just a boy. He doesn’t belong here. He shouldn’t BE here!” Saiioth said, growing more and more concerned. <br>
<br>
The woman sighed, saying, “I guess we need to go talk to Lady Elzadaeli. It’s obvious you’re not going to let this just drop. For your own good, you better hear what she has to say about it.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth nodded grimly. He was sure Elzadaeli would understand. <br>
<br>
________________________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
“Who?” Elzadaeli said, with the same bored tone she produced the first two times she asked. <br>
<br>
“Kaejar. Young lurikeen boy from Ardee,” Saiioth said, his patience nearing its limit. <br>
<br>
“Ah right,” Elzadaeli said, with very little conviction. “And what is the trouble with the boy?” <br>
<br>
“He doesn’t belong here. I don’t think he should be a part of the guild,” Saiioth said, with a little more emotion then he wanted to use. <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli sat quietly for a moment, letting the words hang in the air briefly. <br>
<br>
“I disagree.” <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli turned back to her work at the table. Saiioth did not move to leave. <br>
<br>
“Surely he can not be that important to our guild? There can’t be that much of a need for a mere boy to play a role?” <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli stared at Saiioth, a look of annoyance at being interrupted from her work. <br>
<br>
“He plays a vital role, just like everyone in this guild. There are many benefits to having an “innocent” child about, the most obvious being their ability to get close to a target without them being suspect.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth tried hard from keeping his mouth from dropping open as the meaning of her words became clear. Using children for petty pick pocketing was one thing, but this? <br>
<br>
“Surely you wouldn’t put a child in harm’s way?” <br>
<br>
“How do you think we came to need “another” child assassin?” she retorted. Saiioth thought he detected a slight edge of amusement to her voice. He felt his body grow cold. <br>
<br>
“But you said that everyone is vital to the guild-“ <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli cut him off. “I said he plays a vital ROLE, Saiioth. Just like everyone here. Everyone knows the danger associated with his or her rank. They know that, if they fall, they can be replaced with another, whether that other be a young apprentice mentalist, a mercenary assassin, or even another worthless lurikeen street urchin.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth stared, unblinking. <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli held the stare for a long time. Finally, she said, “I do believe you have an important meeting to attend, Saiioth. I would hate to see you miss it.” <br>
<br>
With that, Elzadaeli turned to her worktable, focusing at the work at hand and forgetting about their discussion. <br>
<br>
Saiioth left, knowing that he had work to focus on as well, but could not forget their conversation. <br>
<br>
He would not forget. <br>

<br>
Saiioth sat in his room, fuming. He had returned from his most recent job, a contact in Lough Gur who had not been as forthcoming with guild funds as he now knew he should be, to watch Kaejar walk calmly through the commons room. <br>
<br>
With a bloody dirk hanging from his belt. <br>
<br>
He knew he had already decided what he had to do. Even if he were able to get Kaejar away from the guild, he would have to deal with Elzadaeli chasing after them, or at the least, recruiting more children for such dirty work. <br>
<br>
Saiioth could not allow himself to be a party to that. <br>
<br>
As night fell in the city of Tir na Nog, Saiioth strapped on his blades, and waited quietly in the darkness of his room for the dead of night. <br>
__________________________________________________________________________ <br>
<br>
He made his way down to the lower floors, staying within the shadows and avoiding the few other guildmembers who were awake this late at night. He found it rather surprising that he encountered no guards, but was not about to question his good fortune. He found the door to Elzadaeli’s room easily enough. <br>
<br>
Saiioth heard a sound from above the stairs, heading down. Without concern, he moved into position, just inside the shadows, but close enough to the door to slip in should this person open the door ahead of him. The guard entered Elzadaeli’s room, with Saiioth diving quietly inside. The shadows were not long, and the rogue held his breath, crouching perfectly still. He knew he would have trouble if he made a move while the guard was in the room as well, but if he came to be discovered, he would be sure to get the first strike. <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli was pouring over a series of reports on the table. She took the guard’s report with little word, just a wave of the hand, and the guard promptly let her be, leaving her room alone. <br>
<br>
Alone for Saiioth. <br>
<br>
He stalked into position, finding a place to make his strike from behind. Gathering himself for one quick run, he crouched down, and leapt forward. <br>
<br>
Aided by his magical bracers, he moved exceptionally fast, even for an elf. As he closed the distance, still silent, Elzadaeli spun around in alarm. <br>
<br>
She raised her hands, as if to stop the blade’s advance. Already within striking range, Saiioth easily avoided the meager defenses, aiming his blade for a quick, deadly stab. <br>
<br>
He felt the blade strike something material. Forcibly, the blade was turned aside, as if Elzadaeli were wearing a suit of scale armor. Saiioth could not slow down his approach, and stumbled forward from the unexpected deflection. <br>
<br>
Into Elzadaeli’s hands. <br>
<br>
With both hands, she grabbed the rogue’s vest. Calmly, as if fully prepared for such a fortuitous situation, she shouted the incantation. An enormous blast propelled Saiioth across the room and into the wall, where he crumpled to the floor. <br>
<br>
He stood groggily, attempting to raise his weapons in a defense. He looked down to see his arms hanging limply at his sides. He strained to gain control of his arms, but could only watch futilely as his grip lessened, dropping the blades to the floor. <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli’s laughter rang in his ears as she calmly walked forward to the rogue, shaking her head. <br>
<br>
“I take you in, I bring peace to your mind, I pay you handsomely for performing the most simple of tasks, and this is how you repay me?” she asked sweetly. <br>
<br>
Saiioth could only return her gaze. <br>
<br>
“Do you honestly think you are the first rogue to EVER try and bring about my demise?” she purred. “Oh poor Saiioth, you have a lot to learn.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth felt his body returning to his control. He bent down, swiftly recovering his blades, and ran towards Elzadaeli. <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli only smiled. <br>
<br>
Saiioth raised his blades to strike, but as he came closer, he slowed. He began to feel an overwhelming sense of dread, of hopelessness, centering on the idea of striking down the woman before him. <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli laughed in his face. <br>
<br>
The turmoil in his mind was too strong. He stared at Elzadaeli, his greatest desire to strike her dead causing him intense mental pain. He knew beyond a doubt that to do so would be followed with his own death, caused by his own mind being overwhelmed by the mental anguish his brain was associating with the idea of causing harm to this elf. <br>
<br>
Tauntingly, Elzadaeli spread her arms wide, giving Saiioth a clean shot. <br>
<br>
Saiioth threw the blades down, disgusted. Elzadaeli nodded, and walked back to her throne. <br>
<br>
“You see, don’t you poor Saiioth? You have no chance against me. There is no point in following this any further. I hope you will now put away such foolish thoughts of harming me, and return to your work.” <br>
<br>
“My work?” Saiioth asked, astounded. <br>
<br>
“Of course. I understand your rebellion. You just haven’t had time to see things clearly. You’re a very capable servant, one that I would like to keep around. Do not give me any reason to doubt you, and you can remain here, working for me, finding escape from your ‘mental condition’,” she said with a sly smile to Saiioth’s shocked face, “and be well paid for your services.” <br>
<br>
“And I suppose if I refuse, you will strike me dead here and now?” Saiioth reasoned. <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli shook her head. <br>
<br>
“Of course not. Such a threat would have no effect on a man who has looked death in the face. No, I will not kill you.” <br>
<br>
Then, too calmly, she stated, “Instead, I will kill Kaejar.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth’s head spun, trying to think of any alternative he could. He cursed under his breath as he became aware of the fact that Elzadaeli was already reading his mind. <br>
<br>
“And if you try to leave, not only will I KNOW you plan to leave before you try, I will kill Kaejar…. <br>
<br>
“By your own hand.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth slumped, feeling defeated. He turned to leave, sickened by the complete failure of his attack, of giving up Kaejar to such a life of vileness, and by the condescending laughter that followed him out of Elzadaeli’s chambers. The laughter rattled inside of his ears all the way back to his room, and stayed with him throughout the night. <br>
<br>
For once in the past months, Saiioth did not sleep well. <br>

<br>
Saiioth sat in his room, where he had remained for the past few days. His equipment was left in a pile on the floor, sitting across the room and out of reach. <br>
<br>
Saiioth barely gave it a second look. <br>
<br>
He had no pressing business. Elzadaeli had purposely given him some time off, to ponder and fully realize how hopeless any retaliation would be against her. Leaving the room only to eat, Saiioth spent another evening alone with his thoughts. <br>
<br>
Saiioth smirked while thinking about that just now. His thoughts weren’t even his own anymore. Every intricate plot, every conceived idea of combating the guildmaster was second guessed, destroyed by doubt, and ultimately given up on. There was no hope in planning when those plans would be so easily seen through, even as they were written up within Saiioth’s own mind. <br>
<br>
His head turned at the slight knock at his door. Even before he could respond, the door opened. In slipped the woman in robes, his assigned partner. She quickly closed the door behind her, and turned to regard the rogue. <br>
<br>
“What is the meaning of this?” the elf asked. <br>
<br>
The woman raised a finger to her lips, removing an ornate candleholder from a fold in her robes. The candle’s design was a swirling pattern of black and white wax. Without a word, the elven mage lit the candle, placing it on a nightstand next to the rogue’s bed. <br>
<br>
Saiioth watched carefully, not completely trusting his “partner” after all that had occurred within the guild’s walls. <br>
<br>
“I’ll ask only once more. What is the meaning of this?” <br>
<br>
“I came to see how you were doing. It’s been a few days since your….altercation with Lady Elzadaeli. I had hoped you would not seem so defeated,” she said, looking over the elven rogue. <br>
<br>
Saiioth looked suspiciously at the woman. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” <br>
<br>
The woman chuckled, but quickly grew serious. “Saiioth, we don’t have much time. Let’s speak bluntly.” <br>
<br>
She noticed him glance over at the candle sitting beside him. <br>
<br>
“The candle is magical in nature. It envelops this room, protecting from prying ears and minds. Any who attempt to delve into the room will be met with a jumble of…amorous feelings and emotions,” she ended, looking pointedly away from the rogue. <br>
<br>
“I beg your pardon?” the rogue asked, raising an eyebrow. <br>
<br>
“Look, we don’t have a lot of time,” she said, returning her eyes to his once more. “I came to see if you were still determined to defeat the guildmaster.” <br>
<br>
The robed woman scowled at the sigh that escaped the rogue. <br>
<br>
“Of course I am! I must!” the rogue began, before losing his spirit. “But I just can’t see any way around her magical edge in this battle….” the rogue said, then just shook his head and shrugged. <br>
<br>
The woman stood before him, her arms crossed with one finger tapping, lost in thought. <br>
<br>
“Perhaps I can help, but only if you think you’re up for the challenge.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth looked up, a slight glimmer returning to his eyes. “Go on.” <br>
<br>
The woman shrugged, “I know of a man who it is said knows more about Lady Elzadaeli than any person. In his possession are many tombs of knowledge and items of magical power. He once worked for Lady Elzadaeli, but has since become a recluse. Only those seeking his treasures visit him now, though none have ever returned. The man was always a trickster, so I assume it is not pure coincidence. Your life might be your only bargaining item as well, but then again, it will be a gamble just leaving the guildhall for more than a day. <br>
<br>
“Of course, the moment you leave this room, Lady Elzadaeli will surely know your plans. Stepping outside of the hall will be the end of your life, and that of your friend, young Kaejar.” <br>
<br>
“So what do you propose?” asked the rogue, looking for guidance from the elven mage. <br>
<br>
“I know how to reach the trickster, and I could get you there by tomorrow morning. You would have to return by the following day. That would be as long as I could cover for your disappearance. All that leaves is how to get you past Lady Elzadaeli’s mental alarms,” she said. <br>
<br>
Saiioth looked to his equipment, piled up on the floor. His eyes stopped on the bracer. <br>
<br>
“Tell me, could you carry my body from this room and to the trickster’s location?” <br>
<br>
The woman followed his gaze, a slow smile crossing her face as she gathered the basics of his plan. <br>
<br>
“I could provide such means, yes. How long will the poison last? Should you wake up before clearing Lady Elzadaeli’s mental range-” <br>
<br>
Saiioth raised a hand, his eyes showing resolve once more. <br>
<br>
“I trust my poisons enough to place my life in their hands. Get me to the trickster, and I will surely return in time,” the rogue replied. “But, tell me, why do you risk involvement to help me?” <br>
<br>
The woman looked away, her eyes subconsciously drawn to the candle’s flame. <br>
<br>
“Though you might not be aware, there are reasons why such an obvious charade provided by the candle’s magic would be accepted by the guildhall’s members,” she said, her voice growing quiet. “Perhaps when you return, they could be discussed more in detail.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth’s eyes widened, but before he could respond, he found his bracer thrown to where he was sitting. <br>
<br>
“But for now, troubled rogue, there is business to tend to. We do not have much time,” she said, her voice once again strong and emotionless. <br>
<br>
The rogue removed the proper needle, poisoned and prepared. He looked up at the woman before him. <br>
<br>
“Thank you for doing so much for so little,” he said, pricking his finger with the needle and lying back on the bed. <br>
<br>
The rogue considered the woman’s smile that followed him into unconsciousness. His instincts grasped desperately for control of his quieting mind, not quite sure of the sincerity or integrity of that Cheshire grin, but ultimately losing to the power of his sleeping poison. <br>

<br>
Saiioth awoke to find the stars fading from sight above him. The rogue rolled over to find himself lying in an open field. He stood up and brushed himself off, trying to get a sense of his surroundings. <br>
<br>
“Ah, now that you’re awake, what do you think you’re doing here?” <br>
<br>
Saiioth turned towards the sudden voice. Standing before a weathered hut was an old man, staring at him. He did not look very happy to find the rogue sleeping in front of him home. <br>
<br>
“I do believe I’m looking for you, good sir,” the rogue responded. <br>
<br>
“Well, then you’re mistaken,” the man called out. “I’m certainly not a ‘good sir’.” <br>
<br>
With that the man turned and entered his small home, though he did not stop to close the door. Having no other option, Saiioth approached and entered the hut. As he stepped through the doorway, the door closed silently behind him. <br>
<br>
A bright chandelier suddenly illuminated the room, and the rogue found himself standing in a huge foyer. Surprised, he looked about the room, turning back to find the ornate door closed solidly behind him. The old man entered from an adjoining room then, with a carafe and two glasses. <br>
<br>
“Well then, perhaps I am the man you are looking for after all. I assume you’ve come to challenge me like all the others?” he said, a bit of mirth now entering his voice. <br>
<br>
Saiioth nodded, still glancing about the enormous room. <br>
<br>
“Come my boy, have a seat. I know, it takes a little getting used to, but you don’t think a man of my stature would waste away my last years in a little stone hut, do you? Now, let’s get on to business. I’m a very busy man, you know.” <br>
<br>
The old man poured two glasses of a dark violet wine. Setting a glass before the rogue, he sat in a chair and sipped thoughtfully. Saiioth took the glass carefully, sniffing the contents. Noticing the chuckle from his host, he decided that this day would be filled with chances, and took a sip from his own glass. <br>
<br>
“You assume much, sir, but let’s continue with that thought then. Suppose I have come to challenge you. What would I challenge you for?” <br>
<br>
The old man smiled, “A sly one, eh? They all think themselves pretty witty before the battle begins. Young man, as you can probably surmise from my very home, I am a man of many magical artifacts. And beyond the mundane and not so mundane trinkets that I own, I have an extensive library. Any object from my personal treasure is yours, should you defeat me. You have my word. <br>
<br>
“However, should I win, you must forfeit your magical items to me. In the event that you do not have any thing worth taking, then you must forfeit your freedom. Judging from your profession and equipment, I can already see that it will have to be the latter for you,” he finished. <br>
<br>
The rogue smiled, judging the old man standing before him as well. He wore fancy leather riding clothes; like aristocrats wore when taking their noonday horse rides. The man had no weapons visible on his person, and certainly did not appear to be ready for any type of battle. <br>
<br>
“I assume we are talking about something other than sword fighting,” the rogue said with a smirk. <br>
<br>
“Very perceptive, young man,” the man smiled, “we will in fact be playing a different type of battle. One I’ve imported from the far foreign lands.” <br>
<br>
He motioned then to a small table, made up entirely of a checkered top. On it’s surface were two lines of figurines, of different heights and shapes. <br>
<br>
“Course, it would be unfair to expect you to know the rules, so I’ll be sure to tell you when you play a foul,” the man began, grinning. <br>
<br>
“I know the game of chess. From Albion, correct?” the rogue smirked. <br>
<br>
“You’ve heard of it?” the old man asked, looking a little deflated. “Well, then perhaps I’ll finally have a challenge. It will be rather entertaining to play someone other than these classless country bumpkins I normally get wandering into my home.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth sat at the table, looking over the pieces carefully. The old man sat down across from him, still sipping his glass of wine. <br>
<br>
“I believe that I go first, correct?” the rogue inquired. <br>
<br>
“Indeed, lad. Be my guest,” smiled the old man. <br>
<br>
Saiioth moved a piece forward. He had read a few books on basic rules and strategy, but had not actually played a game against someone before. He decided to play defensively first, and see where the old man led the game. <br>
<br>
Seven moves later, the old man smiled and said, “Checkmate.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth stared at the board in disbelief. <br>
<br>
“That’s impossible,” Saiioth exclaimed with conviction. “How did you do that?” <br>
<br>
The old man cackled, “Simple lad, because I read your mind.” He raised his hands before the rogue, showing a richly embroidered pair of pale blue leather gloves, with gold stitching. “It wouldn’t matter if you were the best player in the world, you had no chance to win from the beginning!” <br>
<br>
Saiioth’s eyes narrowed as the old man continued to laugh heartily. <br>
<br>
“Play me again.” <br>
<br>
“I’m sorry boy, did you say something?” the man laughed. <br>
<br>
“Play me again.” <br>
<br>
“Lad, don’t take it so hard, everyone loses. There’s no chance to beat me, besides which, you’ve nothing noteworthy to stake another game on.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth’s smile calmed the old man, and piqued his interest. “Oh, I think I do. I’m sure you’ll think right away that I’m bluffing, so go ahead, read my mind,” Saiioth said, calmly closing his eyes and picturing the book stored safely in his personal room back in Tir na Nog. <br>
<br>
The old man tapped his hands thoughtfully. “Okay lad, we’ll give it another go. If I win, I still get your life, but not before you hand over that book.” <br>
<br>
“And if I win, old man, you give me back my freedom, plus the original stake in the first game. Otherwise, no deal,” Saiioth announced, a smirk on his face. <br>
<br>
“It’s not like you can’t read my mind,” he said, in answer to the old man’s trepidation. <br>
<br>
“Okay lad, you’re on!” the old man said, laughing once more, “You’ve got no chance of beating me anyway.” <br>
<br>
The old man’s laughter trailed off to silence at the look on Saiioth’s face. The old man’s fears were realized when Saiioth spoke again. <br>
<br>
“So, what are the rules to the game?” <br>
<br>
The old man began with a slight sigh of relief, “Well lad, each piece has a certain move-“ <br>
<br>
“No, old man,” Saiioth interrupted, “not that game.” <br>
<br>
The old man grew quiet, a look of concern on his face. <br>
<br>
“That’s right. There’s more than one game going on here. Isn’t it odd, that a man with such an advantage would so clearly give it away at the first question? Even when it was so general that one could clearly lie about it? And isn’t it odd that during our first game, you declined to provide the rules to the chess match, yet with but one request you’re prepared to tell me, even when I told you I know how to play the game? <br>
<br>
“So, old man, what are the rules to the game, not including this chess board before us?” <br>
<br>
The old man sighed, and then replied, “There is only one rule. Any question that you ask, I must answer truthfully. <br>
<br>
“Not that it matters, because I can still read your mind,” the old man finished, grinning once more. <br>
<br>
Saiioth studied the board, preparing for his first move. Even as his hand came down to grasp a piece, he looked up at the old man across the table. Placing the piece down and completing his move, he asked, “Tell me, what’s the capital of our fair land, Hibernia?” <br>
<br>
The old man looked vaguely confused, but shook his head and answered, “Such a silly question boy. It’s Tir na Nog.” The old man then completed his own turn. <br>
<br>
Saiioth’s eyes never left the old man, as his hand’s continued to work the board, each move followed by another question. The old man answered them all, continuing to keep up with his opponent’s movements on the board as well. <br>
<br>
“What gets harder to catch the faster you run?” <br>
<br>
“Your breath.” <br>
<br>
“What belongs to you but others use it more than you do?” <br>
<br>
“Your name.” <br>
<br>
“At night they come without being fetched, and by day they are lost without being stolen. What are they?” <br>
<br>
“The stars.” <br>
<br>
And so the questions and riddles continued, matched breath for breath and move for move. Saiioth forced the game faster, but was paced easily by the wise old man. Finally, Saiioth thought he had stumped the old man. <br>
<br>
“You are walking down a road and you come to a fork in the path. You look ahead to see two gates, one on each separate path. In front of both of these gates stands one guard. You've heard of this place before, and you know that one guard will lie to you, and one guard will tell you the truth, but you aren't sure which one is which. If you had to ask one of them one question to figure out which way to go, which person would you ask, and what would you ask them?” <br>
<br>
The old man pondered the question for a long time. Finally, he made his move on the board, answering the question with conviction and calm. <br>
<br>
“You would go up to either one of them, it doesn't matter which one, and say ‘If I were to ask the other guard which way to go, what would he say?’ and whichever gate that person points to, go the opposite way. Pretend for one moment that it is the Truth person you are talking to. He knows that the other one will lie and tell you to go a certain way so they will point that direction and you know that is the wrong way to go, so you go the opposite. But if it was the Liar that you were talking to, he knows that the other guard will tell you the right way to go, but the Liar wouldn't tell you that he will lie, so he will point opposite of what he knows is true...either way you go opposite,” the old man replied, nodding his head with assurance. <br>
<br>
Saiioth smiled, clapping at the old man’s ability. “Well done, good sir!” <br>
<br>
With that, he reached down, to make his next move. Looking up with a smirk, Saiioth announced, “Checkmate.” <br>
<br>
The old man stared with quiet shock at the simplicity of the trap he had walked into, both on the board and within the conversation. With a sigh, he laid down the king. <br>
<br>
“So there you have it,” Saiioth said, “our battle comes to an end. Now then, I do believe the prize was my freedom, and one of your many artifacts of my choosing?” <br>
<br>
The old man nodded numbly, having refocused on the young rogue; he already knew the object that had gained Saiioth’s affections. <br>
<br>
“Hand over the gloves, and I will take my leave, good sir,” Saiioth said, “For I have pressing business to attend to.” <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tylvillenria>Tyl Villenria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/30/03 4:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chased by Shadows</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>**Chased by Shadows** Chapter 7: Midnight/Morning – Emotionless</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
“Have you anything to say, foolish, pitiful, poor, poor Saiioth?” she purred again, “or will you admit your failure, your defeat, your pathetic insistence of seeking a death at my hands?” <br>
<br>
Saiioth glanced up from tugging absently at one of his gloves, infuriating the mage with the look of boredom sincerely on his own face. He raised his arms out; hands extended upward and shrugged, shaking his head from side to side, his gaze looking down once more as he sighed with remorse <br>
<br>
“I see your point. All things being equal, I can’t see how this can possibly turn out any different than our last meeting...” <br>
<br>
The young rogue’s head slowly rose, meeting the gaze of the elven mentalist. The mentalist had overwhelmed many foes before, savoring their look of despair, of terror, as the realization that their time of reckoning was upon them. So it was with a sincere anticipation that she waiting to see the look upon this worthless, brash, boastful young elf, to see him swallow his pride in the last few moments of his useless life. <br>
<br>
It was with sincere disappointment and seething hatred that that anticipation was replaced, as Saiioth smirked. <br>
<br>
“But then, how could I return to such a gracious audience without a gift?” <br>
<br>
Saiioth reached out with his mind, his hand unconsciously stretching forth as well, searching for the mental influences that were the defenses of this room. He quickly found what he was looking for, the mental blanket that made drawing a weapon against Elzadaeli a painful thought. In his mind, he could see the spell, entwined about the room’s walls like a string. He envisioned a sharp edged blade, and his mind gave it shape and form in the mental realm. With a quick slash, the string fell away, dropping the field that restricted such movement. <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli sensed that a spell had been removed, only to have it confirmed by the unsheathing of Saiioth’s very material blades. The blades whirled in his eager hands, as he slowly stalked forward, eyes never leaving the mentalist. <br>
<br>
His advance slowed considerably when Elzadaeli returned to her throne, a smile playing on her lips. She motioned to her right, presenting an opening door to Saiioth. As the door’s creaking finally ended, out walked a boy, adorned in battle armor and wielding two glowing blades. <br>
<br>
Saiioth’s blades slowly lowered as Kaejar approached. He glanced back to Elzadaeli, whose eyes were closed in concentration. The elf studied Kaejar again, noticing the blank look the young lurikeen boy could not shake. It was clear that he was under her control, yet Saiioth dared not engage in battle with the child for fear of seriously wounding him. <br>
<br>
The elf snapped his blades back into their sheaths, closing his eyes as well. He focused all of his strength through the gloves, opening his mind to the room around him. <br>
<br>
Though hazy for a mind untrained in the mental arts, the magical gloves provided enough of a focal point for him to observe the influences clearly, as if they had form and shape. Across the room, Elzadaeli was manipulating Kaejar’s mind and body, her own arms stretching like smoke from her seat. In that seat rose her mind, swaying like a snake’s head as it noticed him awaken in the mental plane. One arm relinquished Kaejar, flying across the room at Saiioth. Purely by reflex, the elf reached out and grappled with the attacking arm, holding it in place in the middle of the room. At the same moment, Elzadaeli’s remaining hand, still holding Kaejar’s mind, raised off the ground, taking Kaejar with her. Below the lurikeen, the ground disappeared into oblivion. Saiioth’s remaining hand, having instinctively moved to prevent the attack by Kaejar’s controlled mind, stopped midway and latched onto the hand holding Kaejar precariously. <br>
<br>
The room was perfectly still, each taking in the current situation in that brief moment. Saiioth realized the implications immediately. With each of them tied up on one side, he could remove his other hand, striking down Elzadaeli instantly. However, in that same instant, Elzadaeli would release Kaejar’s mind, sending it crashing down into the abyss below, causing the lurikeen boy to go into mental shock. And, should he allow her the first move, it would invariably be the same; release of the boy, knowing Saiioth would then rush to save him, leaving himself open to attack. <br>
<br>
Within that moment, Saiioth had made his decision. He released the hand holding Kaejar, moving his hand beneath the child to catch the inevitable drop as Elzadaeli took advantage of the freed arm. <br>
<br>
Elzadaeli’s laughter filled the room as her arm raced forward, aimed to strike Saiioth’s mind. The elf turned away, focusing on catching Kaejar’s mind and getting it to safety. <br>
<br>
The laughter was quickly replaced with a surprised gasp, then a scream of anguish. Saiioth spun around, attempting to make sense of what he saw before him. <br>
<br>
Two arms reached out from the shadows, one grasping the arm Elzadaeli was to use in her attack against Saiioth. The second had wrapped tightly around the mind of Elzadaeli, choking the snake’s head as it made a futile attempt at escaping its hold. <br>
<br>
With both her mental arms held firm, Elzadaeli was defenseless to the newcomer. Saiioth clutched the boy’s mind close and shielded it from the mental screams that emanated from across the room, as Elzadaeli’s mind was attacked by wave after wave of mental energy. The screams grew louder, ringing in Saiioth’s mind, vaguely familiar and stirring within him visions of another horrifying mental attack. Finally, the screams stopped, and the room was silent and still. <br>
<br>
Saiioth looked up and watched with curiosity as the murky mental projections around him slowly dissipated. Quickly, he concentrated on returning to the physical realm, urging his mind to recede to its normal interpretation of his surroundings, as he gently placed Kaejar’s mind and body on the ground before him. <br>
<br>
Standing over the wilted body of Elzadaeli was the woman in robes, a look of detachment on her face. Saiioth walked over, catching their fleeting exchange as Elzadaeli’s last breaths escaped her. <br>
<br>
“N..Naki, how could you do….do this to…me?” Elzadaeli barely uttered, the look of shock on her face following her waning life. <br>
<br>
“It’s just business, mother,” Naki said, her expression unchanged. <br>
<br>
“Nothing personal.” <br>

<br>
Naki knocked on Saiioth’s door twice, with no answer. Finally, she opened the door, to find the rogue sitting at a table, staring into a mirror. The woman glanced over at his bed, apparently unused. <br>
<br>
“Can’t sleep? The nightmares didn’t come back, did they?” she asked, sincerely concerned. <br>
<br>
The elf looked up, noticing her entrance for the first time. His eyes slowly focused on her standing there, and although it was clear he had not slept at all, a bit of spark returned to those eyes. <br>
<br>
“I’ve had a lot on my mind,” he said, smirking as he raised his hands before him, still wearing the magical leather gloves. <br>
<br>
“Don’t worry about me,” Saiioth continued, the mirth slowly leaving his face. “I’ve discovered my demons, and they will be dealt with in due time.” <br>
<br>
“Speaking of which,” Naki broke in, “I was wondering if you’ve given any more thought to remaining here and working with me. There’s a whole guild here, a lot of responsibility to return it to its former honor.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth smirked at the statement. Partly due to the irony of using the word “honor” when talking about a guild of thieves. The other part was because he was sure the irony was lost on the woman standing before him. <br>
<br>
“I must decline,” he stated. <br>
<br>
Naki nodded, disappointment on her face, though not surprise. “I figured as much. It’s pretty clear you’re not cut out for this type of work.” <br>
<br>
She raised her hands defensively as Saiioth narrowed his eyes, “Not that you’re incapable of doing it, of course. It’s just apparent that your heart is somewhere else.” <br>
<br>
“It is?” he said, genuinely amused. <br>
<br>
“I can understand the chance you took in saving Kaejar. From a business standpoint, he was one of your best contacts,” she mused, “However, even that seems secondary.” <br>
<br>
Saiioth sat quietly, thinking. He became aware of a gentle sensation about his mind, just on the outside, glancing in. Absently, he mentally brushed it aside like a fly. <br>
<br>
Naki hid her interest, even though she knew Saiioth had sensed that it was she. Speaking of Kaejar had led Saiioth to examine his own feelings on the matter, and give the curious woman a glimpse before his defense was in place. It was just the briefest of pictures, more like a vague feeling. Parental? <br>
<br>
Surely there was more to this young elf than he let on. <br>
<br>
“Well, I understand, of course,” she continued, “So you’ve decided to move on. Just don’t hesitate if you ever need our services here. I owe you at least that much. So what are you going to do now?” <br>
<br>
Even though Saiioth had pushed her away mentally just moments ago, even without focusing on him she could sense the anger within him, slowly building towards the surface. Naki unconsciously took a physical step back. <br>
<br>
Saiioth looked up, a smirk playing on his face at the display. Standing up, he gathered his belongings and turned to the door. <br>
<br>
Saiioth stopped in front of Naki as he walked past, his eyes meeting hers, only inches apart. Even though his mind was fully defended now from prying, Naki could see clearly through his eyes down into his very soul. His anger, his hatred, his indignation was so focused, Naki silently told herself to never consider crossing this man, and quietly thanked her good fortune that the advantages she already took with him hadn’t sealed her fate. <br>
<br>
Her body shivered noticeably as she watched him walk down the stairs and leave the guildhall, the single word he whispered as he past, like a secret once told would not dare think of being said aloud again, echoed in her mind: <br>
<br>
“Retribution” <br>
<br>
******************************************************************** <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She was running through the forest, the edge of the valley in sight. Even though she desperately wanted to return to her home, her beloved home, her gaze continued to be pulled behind her. As if something was there, in the shadows, watching her. Stalking her. <br>
<br>
Finally her legs slowed, and she came to a stop. The feeling was overpowering now, and could not be ignored. She spun around, eyes darting to every shadow of the forest, searching for whatever was hunting her so diligently. <br>
<br>
To her amazement, the wolf walked into the open. It’s body was black as night, it’s eyes golden like stars in the night sky. It’s eyes shone in the moonlight, staring into her eyes, never moving. They stood there together, motionless. <br>
<br>
A cry of alarm rose from the valley behind her. She knew from the panic it caused that her worst fear was coming true, the attack they expected but hoped in vain would never occur, was gripping her beloved home below. She longed to run to them now, to join them in the battle they had prepared for all of their lives, just in case. <br>
<br>
And yet, the wolf transfixed her, its eyes never moving. It continued to stare, watching for a reaction. It seemed oblivious, or at least uncaring, about the commotion behind them, concerned purely with the relation between itself and the woman. <br>
<br>
The cries of alarm quickly changed to yells of fear and pain, and then to death. She knew what was happening, knew there was no hope for her home unless she arrived and rallied her friends and family. She heard the sound of the fires as they consumed the trees, the fields, and the buildings of her home. She heard the fires as they consumed the bodies of her friends and family. <br>
<br>
Yet the wolf continued to hold her still, it’s eyes demanding her attention, judging her silently, as she listened to her village burn to the ground behind her.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>

<br>
Keeper Rasa awoke with a start. She tried to return to her meditative sleep, but the realization of the dream, the same dream, was the cause of her sleeplessness, made her resign herself to staying away. <br>
<br>
She tried a few relaxation exercises, with no luck. She sat up, taking up a meditative posture and decided to try, once again, to make sense of these images. <br>
<br>
The eyes of the wolf, filled with judgment. <br>
<br>
Every time she closed her eyes now, she saw them. <br>
<br>
The eyes of the wolf, promising retribution. <br>
