<br>
And even by this definition and hair splitting Einstein was indeed a &quot;theist&quot;.  Give it up DBC, just admit your wrong and be done with it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I cannot disprove his belief in a creator, only prove his not being a theist, as has already been done, repeatedly.<br>
<br>
That statement is ultimately an oxymoron when you think about it.  Even by your own definition, Einstein could certainly be classified as a &quot;theist&quot; since he claimed God was revealed through nature and therefor a part of &quot;reality&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;(see above) Until you can come to accept the dictionary definitions of words, there is no agreement you will be able to reach here, ever.<br>
<br>
I guess you just aren't capable of admitting when you're blowing smoke eh?  You'd rather split hairs over word definitions and play games with meaning.  Einstein clearly did believe in a creator and explicitly stated he was not an atheist.  Deal with it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Again, the language barrier. I went to a dictionary site, I copied the definitions found, how is this my personal definition or opinion? <br>
<br>
You tried to split hairs over the meaning of the word: <br>
Main Entry: im·ma·nent <br>
Pronunciation: -n&amp;nt<br>
Function: adjective<br>
Etymology: Late Latin immanent-, immanens, present participle of immanEre to remain in place, from Latin in- + manEre to remain <br>
Date: 1535<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  remaining or operating within a domain of reality or realm of discourse</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As this quote clearly demonstrates, not only does Einstein believe God operates within the domain of reality, but certainly within the realm of &quot;discourse&quot;.  Get a clue!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive With our frail and feeble minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible Universe, forms my idea of God. <br>
<br>
Quoted in the New York Times obituary April 19, 1955<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
 <br>
&gt;&gt;Do I need a consensus across dictionaries?<br>
<br>
No.  Upon further review, your own definition did quite nicely thanks!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Theism requires an immanent god,<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; Only according to ONE definition of the term.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Yeah, the English language one.<br>
<br>
And when you actually look at the meaning of that word and note what Einstein said, your definition actually works just fine.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Atheism says there is no god,<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; Which Einstein clearly didn't agree with and resented being associated with.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Point agreed upon…<br>
<br>
Yet you keep associating him with atheism.  Somewhat disengenious if you ask me.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt;Bzzt! Wrong! One ideology suggest that God doesn't exist. The other suggests God does exist but doesn't get involved in human affairs while on earth. These are RADICALLY different core beliefs.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Not so very radical if you cannot show any effect that they produce.<br>
<br>
You can see the effect produce on Einsteins &quot;discourse&quot; can't you?  I know I sure can!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Yes Michael, I think everyone here can see the difference in believe something exists and not believing something exists. The point is that it isn’t significant if it doesn’t produce an effect.<br>
<br>
But even by his statements, this &quot;deity&quot; did have an &quot;effect&quot; on Einstein's writings, on his beliefs, and on his life in general!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;A deist functions in act and motive the same as an atheist. A theist does not.<br>
<br>
NO!!!!!  That's your personal opinion as though you speak for all &quot;deists&quot;, and as though their beliefs have no effect upon their life that might be different from yours.  That's utterly and completely rediculace!<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; Only by your personal definition.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Yes, and apparently those of Miriam Websters Publishing and other deists as well, but if you disagree, then we all must be wrong, huh?<br>
<br>
No, actually once I took a closer look at it, Webster seems to be in agreement with ME, not with YOU!  Maybe you can find a better definition to support your case, but that one really didn't work.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;OOH, getting personal here Mike, be careful what you lay claim to, we may call you on it later.<br>
<br>
ooooh, I'm scared, I'm scared. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt;What a great rationalization to take a man's CLEAR statement that he WAS NOT AN ATHEIST, and turn it around to suit your own value system using flawed logic. Sorry, but that's a BIG TIME rationalization and a logical fallacy.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Please point out where I say Einstein is an atheist?<br>
<br>
You keep claiming he's a &quot;functional&quot; atheist.  Read your own last few posts there mate.  That's what you tried to claim.   I might as well turn things around and claim you are a functional deist who really does believe in a creator after all.  See the flaw in your rationalizations yet?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Is your understanding so limited that you think there is an either/or relationship here?<br>
<br>
Yes.  Either one believe in a creator or one does not.  Einstein clearly did.  You do not.  He resented atheists trying to use his comments to support their views.  You however continue to try and do exactly that.  What's clear here is that you don't like the idea that the world's greatest scientist accepted the idea that there is a creator, so you dance and rationalize and tiptoe around until you come up with some cockamaimy story about him being a &quot;functional atheist&quot;.  BZZZT!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;No other option but theist and atheist?<br>
<br>
Either one believes in a creator or not.  From there an infinite number of &quot;belief systems&quot; are possible, but the concept of creator is pretty much either/or, or undecided.  Einstein wasn't &quot;undecided&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The False Dichotomy is a logical fallacy, one you are comiting here when you try and imply more to what I say than I really do. I am saying (for like the 37th time) is that Einstein is not a theist. <br>
<br>
And you are wrong.  He was certainly a theist, even by your own dictionary definition!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Stamp your little feet and insist your definitions are right and we evil atheists are perverting language, but you remain wrong.<br>
<br>
I'm comfortable with the definitions you provided which clearly indicate he fit the term &quot;theist&quot;.  I'm sure you'll worm and squirm some more over the meaning of the term immanent.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Einstein was not a theist.<br>
<br>
Yes he was, even by your own definition.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What I said, and freely repeat, is that he may have been a deist (but he never came out and said he was) and that in practice,<br>
<br>
I've listed several quotes of his demonstrating the effect of his beliefs on his writings.  Clearly he was &quot;effected&quot; by his beliefs.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;the differences between deist and atheist are negligable.<br>
<br>
Bull!  That's just your pitiful rationalizations running amuck.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I am not saying they are nonexistent, just not significant.<br>
<br>
That's your rationalizing mind trying to avoid the obvious.  Either one believes in a creator or one does not, or one cannot decide.  Einstein believed we were created and had a creator.  He was no atheist.  Deal with it and stop the tap dance routine.  It's making you look bad.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Then Kim (MightyK) the deist interjected agreement. <br>
<br>
Kim is entitled to his/her opinion on the matter too, but Kim doesn't speak for EVERY deist.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;SO the atheist agrees with the deist that the differences in practice are insignificant, but the all-wise, all-knowing michael knows so much better than we. <br>
<br>
The all-wise, all-knowing Michael knows that people are &quot;individuals&quot;, not cardboard cut outs you can stick in little slots.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What Einstein describes and everyone quotes here is in total keeping with the practices of deism. One of us is perverting his words, but it ain’t an atheist doing it.<br>
<br>
You are the one trying to associate him with atheism, a notion he specifically stated made him angry.  I doubt he'd be the least bit bothered by me claiming he believed in a creator.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;(The definition from websters is very long, so I’ll cut to the chase.) Do you agree that a function is “doing” something? <br>
<br>
How creating the universe for &quot;doing something&quot;?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Where then is the action or effect produced in ones life when you think there is no god or you think there is a god but he isn’t doing anything?<br>
<br>
*IF* one believes in God, even if you do not believe he goes out of his way to meddle in physical reality, the do believe he created it to start with.  To suggest that's not DOING SOMETHING that has ultimately effected ones life is utterly preposterous.  Now you can claim that he didn't think God would answer prayers, but that doesn't mean he believed God never did anything.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; It does matter that God exists even were he decide to NEVER change things on earth. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Why?<br>
<br>
Because even in those conditions, what comes after this physical life is over is still in question and has relevance on how one lives their life here on earth!<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt;These REASONS are important however regardless of how you try to rationalize and squirm and twist the facts.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Why?<br>
<br>
Because a &quot;deist&quot; is not an &quot;atheist&quot; or we wouldn't have two term to describe these belief systems!  <br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; That is where you try to stuff YOUR PERSONAL OPINION into the discussion. That COMPLETELY depends on the individual, you don't get to decide that.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Ok, so I agree with the dictionary, a diest comes by and confirms her agreement with what I said, and yet we remain wrong.<br>
<br>
You two represent two possible beliefs.  You do not represent every deist in every way.  Get it?  Everyone is an &quot;individual&quot;, and while Kim may or may not agree with everything you've said here (that remains to be seen by the way), even still, Kim only represents one opinion on the matter.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;It must get lonely being the smartest and rightest human alive mikey.<br>
<br>
I'm not the one who looks up at the stars and night and professes to be the greatest intellect in existence. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Must be lonelier for you.  I share my core beliefs with 80-90% of the human population.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; No it isn't! The deist believes that God exists and created the universe. The atheist believes no such thing. I might as well claim that you &quot;functionally&quot; believe in a creator and you aren't really an atheist. Is that acceptable to you?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Sure, if you can show me the function part. As soon as I produce a function that is different between me an a theist (let’s take prayer for example) then there is a difference. Ooops, you are wrong again, so sorry.<br>
<br>
So I am right to claim that you functionally believe in a creator of the universe?<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; Maybe not now, but how about after this life is over? Are you going to tell me that every deist sees these issues just as an atheist would? <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I suspect so,<br>
<br>
You mean you really really really wish it were so, but clearly that isn't going to be the case for EVERY deist.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;but don’t take my word for it, Let’s ask one!<br>
<br>
One is not representative of ALL.  Shall you ask a &quot;Christian&quot; what my beliefs are because he's also a &quot;theist&quot;?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Also, I don’t have any evidence of anything ‘after this life is over’ if you do, please share it with us.<br>
<br>
It's called NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES.  You might check out the concept of reincarnation and read a few books on some of the case studies done by the doctor I cited. <br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; Are you a &quot;functional deist&quot;?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You could make a good argument for it. Except I openly declared my atheism and Einstein never declared his deism,<br>
<br>
But you don't believe in a creator do you?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;just described his views and they happen to thoroughly match those of deists.<br>
<br>
You took his words and twisted them to suit your purposes against the express wishes of the man himself.  Kind of a rude thing to do if you ask me.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; I see the difference, but you keep glossing right over the differences between a &quot;deist&quot; who believe in a creator and an atheist who does not. These are not the same belief systems and you know it, you just try and rationalize it away because it irks you to know the most revered scientist of our time believed in a creator and looked for evidence of this creator in the universe around us.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Actually, he wasn’t a scientist of our time. He died before my time. I think Richard Feynman, Carl Sagan and Steven Hawkins are some of the most revered scientists of my time. It also doesn’t irk me one bit what he believed. I said before (and judging from your inability to agree on language will no doubt say again)<br>
<br>
Even by your own definition, he was a theist.  Language is a tricky thing at times.  What is less 'fuzzy' is Einsteins belief in a creator.  Under no circumstances then can you define him as a &quot;atheist&quot;, functionally or otherwise.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I could care less what he believed,<br>
<br>
Ya right.  That's why you keep trying to stuff him into a box of &quot;functional atheist&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I only care that a theist was trying to advance a propaganda agenda that was unfounded, false and baseless.<br>
<br>
I haven't said anything I can't support or in defiance of his wishes.  You have.  If anyone is spreading false propaganda, it is you, not me.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;There is no difference in the life of an atheist and a deist.<br>
<br>
Bull!  That is a statement of faith if ever I heard one.  Are you a deist too and do you speak for all deists?  Give me a break!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Neither of us choose to behave as we do for fear of gods wrath. <br>
<br>
Neither do I, but that does not mean that you and I are exactly the same.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;We choose our morals based on common sense not dogmatic edict.<br>
<br>
Neither do I.  Are you and I the same?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;We appreciate the nature and beauty of life on its intrinsic value.<br>
<br>
Same answer.  Are we the same?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; We seek truth that can be empirically seen, tested, reproduced and is quantifiable. We can quest for answers about life and our universe without fear of it unhinging our views.<br>
<br>
Ya, so?  Are we the same even though we share these things in common?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;We do not pray and expect results, we do not uncertainly question his will or our fates.<br>
<br>
That is ultimate a statement of faith since don't really know what affect a deist's beliefs might have on their life.  How do you know they don't question their fate?  Faith?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;God is out of the equation for our decisions. Period.<br>
<br>
No.  God is out of the equation for YOUR decisions, but not Einsteins.  He believed in God.  He was not certain of his fate.  Even he did not speak for every deist and he didn't even claim to be a deist.  The one thing he did claim is that he WASN'T AN ATHEIST and RESENTED anyone using his words to promote the idea!  Period!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Oh, but Mikey, <br>
<br>
Is your use of the term &quot;mikey&quot; an attempt to bother me?  Is that your idea of intelligent debate?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I said earlier a few posts ago that deism was on the other side of agnosticism from atheism and you said I was wrong, am I not allowed to reply to your refutation? Do I *HAVE* to stick to the fight you want?<br>
<br>
As long as this thread is already, I see little reason to wander off on tangents.  Be my guest if it floats you boat, but I'll likely ignore it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; You aren't a qualified judge of my life or of my experiences are you?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Sure I am, you brought it up here, I am responding to it. See what happens when you take a stand?<br>
<br>
What are my life experiences?  How can you judge them?<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; When did this conversation become about me? <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;When you started posting your beliefs. Just trying to understand the rationale behind them since you won’t actually come right out and say them.<br>
<br>
Since you can't seem to remember the topic, this thread was about Einstein, not me.  My beliefs are irrelevant to this topic.  See how that works?<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; I can play this game too you know.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Mikey, you’ve been playing this game the whole time. Every time you say ideas ‘rock my world’ or I am ‘disrespecting his memory’ or ‘twisting meanings’ or something is ‘too much for me to handle’.<br>
<br>
That does seem to be part of the problem.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt;Perhaps the reason you are an &quot;atheist&quot; is because you have an ego problem and are unwilling to submit yourself to a higher power. Maybe you look at the stars at night and claim &quot;There is no God for I am the greatest intellect in the universe and smarter than 80-90 percent of humanity&quot;. Isn't this fun? <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Funny thing you bring up here Mikey, the smartest man in America happens to be an atheist.<br>
<br>
Who's that?  Did he accomplish what Einstein accomplished?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The rate of atheism among geniuses is twice that of average people and 4 times that of below average people.<br>
<br>
Ah, I see I DID hit a key issue then.  You equate intelligence with atheistic belief eh?  Why wasn't Einstein an atheist?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Maybe you are correct. I am an atheist, I MUST be the highest order of intelligence on the planet!<br>
<br>
You must have a large ego.  That has nothing to do with intelligence.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;No wonder I am unwilling to submit myself to any higher powers!<br>
<br>
Ego is indeed a difficult &quot;adversary&quot; to being open minded.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Well, that and there don’t happen to actually BE any higher powers…<br>
<br>
Can you empirically demonstrate this statement of faith, or shall we just take you word for it?  Why is it your views are only shared by such a tiny minority of the human population?  <br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; Yet you seem to have come to the CONCLUSION that God doesn't exist. How did you come to that conclusion? Blind faith?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Nope, no blind faith here, just a total lack of evidence that god exists.<br>
<br>
Which is ultimately BLIND FAITH since you have drawn conclusions that suit you, not necessarily the evidence.  NDE's, the statistical rate of theism, personal experience, studies of reincarnation, all support the concept of God.  Your reject this &quot;data&quot; in favor of your own faith system.  WhoopieeEEEEE<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I conclude that unless or until evidence is provided that god exists, I will not waste time with it.<br>
<br>
Can you empirically demonstrate consciousness or feelings?  Is love &quot;real&quot;?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Sure thing, assign a property to it and I will disprove it.<br>
<br>
I just did!  &quot;creator&quot;.  Disprove this property.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; Do you believe God exists? If not, what is the basis of your faith in this opinion?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;See above, total lack of evidence.<br>
<br>
There isn't a &quot;total&quot; lack of evidence.  Only evidence that you personally reject, i.e. NDE's, past life experiences, statistical rates of theism, etc.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I don’t believe in something just because I can’t disprove it, I believe in something because the evidence supports it.<br>
<br>
You are still &quot;interpreting&quot; data to suit your own preconcieved prejudices.  It's still ultimately an act of blind faith on your part to claim there is no God.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; Which is why I reject religion. See how that logic works for me too?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Yup, which is also why I suggest you examine deism, as a more rational stance than your current one.<br>
<br>
Those are &quot;labels&quot;.  What are my beliefs?  What give you the right to even suggest you know me well enough to know what's wrong with my beliefs?  Another example of that overinflated ego rearing it's ugly head perhaps?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Yes I can. I can base my belief upon my own life experiences and the expreriences of 80-90 percent of humanity.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Ah, but then that doesn’t inherently include logic<br>
<br>
Logically, if 80-90 percent of the planet accepts the presense of a creator, the odds would suggest I'm right, and you are wrong.  What &quot;logic&quot; do you use to avoid that &quot;fact&quot;?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and factual truth,<br>
<br>
Factually, people overwhelmingly accept the presense of a creator.  Factually poeple do have near death experiences of an afterlife.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;just a diluted form of everyone else’s opinion.<br>
<br>
Let's look at this logically now.  I claim to have personal expience of God.  I can verify that I'm not alone here by noting that 80-90 percent of the the human population shares my views.  I have external corroboration of my beliefs.  <br>
<br>
You on the other hand LACK any such experience, and PROJECT this upon the human population as a whole.  When however we review this human population, we find they don't share your views.  How then do you validate your beliefs exactly?  How do we know it's not you with the diluted opinion?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; It is a logical fallacy,<br>
<br>
It's statistical FACT.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;it is a weak argument,<br>
<br>
That's a judgment call on your part, not fact.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and it doesn’t prove anything.<br>
<br>
You haven't proven God doesn't exist have you?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You are starting from a falsehood so your conclusion is invalid. Lacking evidence, there is no cause to start from a belief in a god.<br>
<br>
Let's start with the &quot;evidence&quot; that 80-90 percent of the populations believes in God.  Let's state with the &quot;evidence&quot; of NDE's.  Let's start with the evidence of case studies of past life memories.  Not enough evidence for you personally?  I'd call that a judgement call based on faith, not a lack of evidence.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt;&gt; But he did come out and reject atheism by name. Funny you seem so intent on doing exactly what he claimed to resent.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Where? At what point do I say he is an atheist?<br>
<br>
Geez!  You callled him a &quot;functional atheist&quot;.  See above.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I say he functions as would an atheist, but I do not say he is one.<br>
<br>
You did exactly what he said made him angry.  You tried to use his words to promote or support atheism when he expressly shunned atheism and resented what you are doing.  How rude of you.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You really seem to have trouble with language here Mikey.<br>
<br>
You really enjoy that mikey thing don't you.  Is this what you consider &quot;intelligent debate&quot;?  Your superior intellect seems a bit underwhelming if have to resort to that kind of childishness. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; Yet you claim hes a &quot;functional atheists&quot;???????<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Yes, I did.<br>
<br>
Which he clearly resented and said so in writing.  Not exactly an intellectually honest approach from a guy who seems to think he's smarter than 90% of the human race and Einstein too.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; He functions no differently than an atheist in practice. <br>
<br>
Bull!  That's your projection.  He did embrace God.  That's functionally different than an atheist.  Deal with it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;He did not pray, he did not expect god to light up some bush and use is as a public address system, he did not believe anyone was crucified for him or he would burn in hell.<br>
<br>
Well I don't typically pray that much but I do at times.  Other than that I don't do any of those things either, but you and I aren't &quot;functionally&quot; the same.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; He believed here and now was what we get and that the universe was the highest order of beauty and mystery.<br>
<br>
You project that, but you don't KNOW that.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Exactly the same as me and many of my atheist buddies. Functionally an atheist.<br>
<br>
Disfunctional would be a better term.  You can't even separate what a diest is as separate from an atheist.  That's not functional, that's disfunctional.<br>
<br>
M&gt; NO! He came out and said he wasn't an ATHEIST!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Yes, he said he was not an atheist and he further rejected all the qualities of theism as well as flat out saying his views on religion were being systematicly twisted.<br>
<br>
Bull.  More rationalizing and tap dancing.  He embrace a creator.  Accept it.  Deal with it, and quit burying your head in the sand.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Please review the earlier posts for the quotes. I started off trying to respond to you in your idiom<br>
<br>
Ah, now this superior intellect of yours is resorting to fallacies in lew of rational arguement.  How quaint.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Jeez Mikey,<br>
<br>
More examples of your superior intelligence in action eh?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;between the two of us, it isn't me that seems morbidly upset at the idea of losing Albert as their theological model.<br>
<br>
I don't consider him my theological model. That's called a strawman.  It's another one of those fallacy thingies you keep resorting to.<br>
<br>
I am not trying to pigeonhole him into a belief system he rejected by name, and resented being associated with.  That's the product of your overactive ego, er make that &quot;superior intelligence&quot; in action. It's your game,  not mine.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Why does it &quot;irk&quot; you or &quot;rock your world&quot; so?<br>
<br>
It doesn't.  I simply respect his wishes and note that he rejected atheism by name. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Does your worldview totally lose its validation if 90% of the planet and one dead physicist doesn't agree with you?<br>
<br>
No, there are a few billion more folks I'd still share my belief in a creator with.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;There is more of the same drivel in your post but it is a repeat of what has already been responded to so I will spare our lurkers the pain of skipping this over for being even longer than it already is and end your rebuttal here. I don't think I'll try this way again, what a pain in the ass.<br>
<br>
Ah, more name calling and personal insult.  I'm in awe of your superior intellect...NOT.<br>

Oh blast my pile of work and conference calls and meetings while all this excitement is going on!!

Okay, I'll bite--<br>
<br>
dag, Mike, &amp; the jubled numbers guy--I admit to loving Einstein and feel he was a genius. I also tend to think of him as a deist, but don't give two craps if he believed in god...he proved on several occasions he was too arrogant to admit some stupid mistakes (like dividing by zero) and was a terrible womanizer. Does this make him less of a physicist or great thinker to me? No. Does it totally change his work? No. Lots of great men were religious or at least acknowledged a higher power and I try not to hold it against them<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I suppose this is why I've stayed off this thread from the beginning, but then DBC does us proud and hardly needs back up either do you my dear?<br>

<br>
Actually what I'm suggesting here is that I have had MANY personal experiences of God.  If these experiences are more than just a figment of my imagination, I would expect to see statistical validation of such things in the population as a whole and expect other to have similar experiences.  From talking with friends and family I know others have such experiences, and from the statical evidence that God is embraced by 80-90 percent of humanity, I think it's pretty well established that my group of friends is representative of the whole rather than a statistical minority. <br>
<br>
How do you validate your opinions?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;along with hehehheheeh...&quot;personal experience&quot; <br>

Are you dismissing these experiences out of hand without knowing what they are?  If I have them and you do not, is that evidence that your LACK of experience is representative of the whole?  Is that a &quot;scientific&quot; way of studying a subject?<br>
<br>

<br>
Dismissing that out of hand too?  Did you read anything from the author I suggested before concluding it was worthless, or is this another statement of faith on your part?<br>

I don't know dag all that well, but for the time being I'll take that as a compliment based on the atheist's presentation of information I've seen here so far.  Maybe that will change over time, maybe not.   I suppose that depends on how things go.  So far I'm not all that impressed with the athiests I've met here, and I'm not much impressed with my own stint as an atheist in my youth.<br>

Pronunciation: 'fa-l&amp;-sE<br>
Function: noun<br>
Inflected Form(s): plural -cies<br>
Etymology: Latin fallacia, from fallac-, fallax deceitful, from fallere to deceive<br>
Date: 14th century<br>
1 a obsolete : GUILE, TRICKERY b : deceptive appearance : DECEPTION<br>
2 a : a false or mistaken idea &lt;popular fallacies&gt; b : erroneous character : ERRONEOUSNESS<br>
3 : an often plausible argument using false or invalid inference <br>
<br>
There is no such fallacy in standard logical debate known as “ridicule as an arguement”.  That is neither a plausible argument using false or invalid inferences, nor trickery.  It is pretty much a reflection of the respect you have shown being returned to you.<br>
<br>
There are several childish acts that can be performed in a debate, kudos to you for using so many of them.  However, this will not be a productive exchange of information if you remain incapable of agreeing on terms and language.  Not that you have demonstrated an interest in exchanging ideas, just spewing vitriol as fast as possible and tenaciously refusing anything that might threaten your fragile grip on Einstein’s coattails.  <br>
<br>
Now, as I have said repeatedly, I do not care if Einstein was a deist or an atheist or a worshipper of The Great Pumpkin. It makes no difference to me personally.  What does matter is when people try and validate their position by attaching it to someone else.  This is a logical fallacy known as the Argument from Authority.  The implication that because someone is smart or has notoriety or a degree, their statements are inherently more valid than the opposing opinions.  What compounds this failing is when they are incorrectly attributing a position to someone who doesn’t hold it!  Which is the case at hand where you michael are trying to repaint Einstein as a theist when he clearly and repeatedly declared he wasn’t in word, deed and print.<br>
<br>
I can look at a deist organization and read their charter and self-description, I can speak to deists and ask their views, they can come forward and tell you themselves what they think and feel, and it will never be enough for you because it doesn’t support your beliefs.  Ultimately, we can never roll out each and every single deist in the universe and scrutinize their minds to the utmost degree and absolutely, conclusively without doubt or hesitation say we know exactly specifically precisely what they are.  That is not possible.  How sad that that impossibility is where your ‘proof’ stands.<br>
<br>
I have no problem admitting when I am wrong, I have spent my life doing it.  The nice part is that the more often you see your mistakes and acknowledge them, the less often they arise again, because you learnt from them and grew from the experience.  You have been asked directly to explain your reasons for your belief, and yet have not.  You have been asked for specific studies and explanations, which you artfully turn into higher demands from the requestor rather than reasoned responses.  You like the interjectory and chaotic reply style that lacks cohesion and thought.  A collection of one-liner jabs, how admirable.<br>

 <br>
&gt;&gt;However, this will not be a productive exchange of information if you remain incapable of agreeing on terms and language.<br>
 <br>
You are the one trying to split hairs over word definitions not me.  Even by your own reference, Einstein was certainly a &quot;theist&quot;.<br>
 <br>
&gt;&gt; Not that you have demonstrated an interest in exchanging ideas, just spewing vitriol as fast as possible and tenaciously refusing anything that might threaten your fragile grip on Einstein’s coattails. <br>
 <br>
I have no intention of riding on anyone's coattails, I'm simply appauled you would try to associate him with atheism when he clearly and directly refuted the idea.  Can you cite me a single statement I've made that suggests I'm trying to &quot;ride his coattails&quot;, or should I assume this is another of your famous strawman fallacies?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What does matter is when people try and validate their position by attaching it to someone else.<br>
<br>
When did I do that?  The only reason I got involved in this debate is because I couldn't believe an atheist was trying to suggest Einstein was an atheist, &quot;functionally&quot; or otherwise when he clearly rebuked the idea!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;This is a logical fallacy known as the Argument from Authority. <br>
<br>
Which I didn't do.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The implication that because someone is smart or has notoriety or a degree, their statements are inherently more valid than the opposing opinions. What compounds this failing is when they are incorrectly attributing a position to someone who doesn’t hold it!<br>
<br>
You mean like you tried to do by suggesting he was a &quot;functional&quot; atheist when he clearly dismissed that ideology?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Which is the case at hand where you michael are trying to repaint Einstein as a theist<br>
<br>
Even by your definition, he is a theist, and certainly did believe in a creator he called &quot;God&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;when he clearly and repeatedly declared he wasn’t in word, deed and print.<br>
<br>
Bull!<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I can look at a deist organization and read their charter and self-description, I can speak to deists and ask their views, they can come forward and tell you themselves what they think and feel, and it will never be enough for you because it doesn’t support your beliefs. <br>
<br>
Einstein never claimed to be a &quot;deist&quot;.  He did claim he WAS NOT AN ATHEIST.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Ultimately, we can never roll out each and every single deist in the universe and scrutinize their minds to the utmost degree and absolutely, conclusively without doubt or hesitation say we know exactly specifically precisely what they are. That is not possible. How sad that that impossibility is where your ‘proof’ stands.<br>
<br>
Yet you keep trying to claim that every deist is a &quot;functional atheist&quot;.  What nonsense.  My proof stands on the fact that he mentioned God often.  My proof stands in his clear rebuke of atheism and being used to promote atheism.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I have no problem admitting when I am wrong, I have spent my life doing it.<br>
<br>
Yet you won't cop to your failures here will you?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The nice part is that the more often you see your mistakes and acknowledge them, the less often they arise again, because you learnt from them and grew from the experience.<br>
<br>
Yes I know.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You have been asked directly to explain your reasons for your belief, and yet have not. <br>
<br>
Because I question your motives in knowing such things about me and my life.  I see no particular reason to tell you frankly, and this conversation is about Einstein, not me!  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You have been asked for specific studies and explanations, which you artfully turn into higher demands from the requestor rather than reasoned responses.<br>
<br>
I have asked nothing of you except to support what you claim.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You like the interjectory and chaotic reply style that lacks cohesion and thought. A collection of one-liner jabs, how admirable.<br>
<br>
Which seems infinitely better than the insults and ridicule and blatent disregard for Einstein's statements you have been hiding behind.<br>

<br>
&quot;Actually what I'm suggesting here is that I have had MANY personal experiences of God.&quot;<br>
<br>
And what I'm claiming is that personal experiences, or visions do not equal scientific evidence. <br>
<br>
&quot;If these experiences are more than just a figment of my imagination, I would expect to see statistical validation of such things in the population as a whole and expect other to have similar experiences.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not necessarily. Many claim to have had experiences with different gods or demons that most people would now not recognize as genuine. This neither validates nor disproves your personal experience. There are many perfectly sound scientific explanations for why people get warm and fuzzy during prayer, see visions, hear voices in their heads, are healed from meditation and &quot;prayer&quot; and see lights and tunnels in near death experiences. Some are proof of mental illness and others are merely explanations of why otherwise rational people might experience &quot;events&quot; that can be interpreted as supernatural. You have not yet provided a shred of actual proof for any of these, though perhaps you are preparing to do so. <br>
<br>
&quot;From talking with friends and family I know others have such experiences, and from the statical evidence that God is embraced by 80-90 percent of humanity, I think it's pretty well established that my group of friends is representative of the whole rather than a statistical minority.&quot;<br>
<br>
As are many of my friends. Tell me, Michael, if your friends all believed the earth was flat (as 80-90% of the planet once did) and they were a statistically valid representation of the population, would that make their claim of a flat earth scientifically valid? <br>
<br>
&quot;How do you validate your opinions?&quot;<br>
<br>
Well depends which opinions. My opinion that onions taste good needs no validation--it's subjective and personal. The fact that they are good for you because of certain chemicals contained therein and that eating a low-fat, low-red meat diet with plenty of onions and other healthy vegetables and fuits will be good for me is backed by medical science and actual studies--not stories my grandma and sister tell me about magical curative onions. See the difference?<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you dismissing these experiences out of hand without knowing what they are?&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I am dismissing your use of them as &quot;proof&quot; or evidence of a supernatural power. This is laughable..HAHAHA<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;If I have them and you do not, is that evidence that your LACK of experience is representative of the whole?&quot;<br>
<br>
No, it is proof of my mental stability. I am sorry to hear you are delusional and sorrier to hear you are embracing this as evidence of contact with an imaginary sky daddy, but hey--whatever numbs you to reality.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that a &quot;scientific&quot; way of studying a subject?&quot;<br>
Yes Michael. Apparently you have limited exposure to science or scientific experimentation if you believe that it involves gathering one's &quot;personal experiences&quot; and feelings and then drawing sweeping conclusions with dire and eternal consequences. Science is logical, methodical and objective. That is how I would approach studying a subject.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dismissing that out of hand too? Did you read anything from the author I suggested before concluding it was worthless, or is this another statement of faith on your part?&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't have to dismiss this &quot;out of hand&quot;, I have read many reincarnation books, including eastern ones and am familiar with Hindu and other major belief systems. I don't believe them, nor has anyone yet proven reincarnation. I do have pagan friends who belive in this in a sort of Jonathon Bach way, but they don't have proof either. They just &quot;feel&quot; it and don't pretend this &quot;feeling&quot; equals scientific evidence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you demonstrate that this &quot;opinion&quot; of yours is any more valid than mine, or are you just using ridicule as an arguement?&quot;<br>
<br>
Which opinion? That you put faith in phantom fears or that logic and reason are what I choose? Or is it that I defend your right to be irrational? This is not opinion. Faith is neither rational nor logical and those who embrace it pride themselves on the absence of proof here. Believing with no good evidence and in the face of reason is what faith is--some are proud of this--I am not one of them.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd love to see how you've deduced these issues to be &quot;anecdotal fairy tales&quot; without ever researching them. I fail to see how you can claim that's logical or reasonable.&quot;<br>
<br>
And here you assume I have no research. On what basis do you assume this? There are thousands of years of history and mythology/fairy tales/religion to back up my claim....how do you sort the fairty tales out?<br>
<br>
&quot;The last medical study I cited here did not have a medical explanation to offer. Do you have a scientific study that explains all these experiences adequatly, or is this just another &quot;opinion&quot; of yours?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, I will get them for you as soon as I am able, as mine are all hard copy.<br>
<br>
&quot;You guys are familiar with the basic definitions of fallacies, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
You got me honey---lamenting your ignorance and refusal to use reason on a debate board. Guilty and probably guilty again. Note that I did not dismiss your argument totally or refuse to respond based on this, just sad to see you're not the man I'd hoped to go head to head with that's all...I'm sure it's not the crushing blow to your ego you are pretending it is....or does Mama mean that much to you<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;So far I'm not all that impressed with the athiests I've met here, and I'm not much impressed with my own stint as an atheist in my youth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then leave. And sorry to hear how you are disappointed with yourself in your youth. I'm not that proud of being a mindless theist as a child, but then indoctrination and fear are powerful weapons used by the religionists and I was very small. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm simply noting that theism and criminal activity are not one and the same concept, and atheists commit crimes as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Duh, but they commit them less often and stay married longer and are more successful and intelligent in general. I'm not sure which is the cause and which is the effect, but quit acting like atheists are all just too stupid, uninformed or arrogant to believe in a diety and you'll get farther.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps you have a study you'd like to cite for me that filters out the affects of &quot;education&quot; from the notion of atheistic beliefs as it relates to these statistics?&quot;<br>
<br>
Several actually<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.objectivethought.com/atheism/iqstats.html">www.objectivethought.com/...stats.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
and the Barna study on marriage conducted by theists<br>

<br>
&quot;Or perhaps theism is healthier for humans and atheism is just irrelevant.&quot;<br>
<br>
Only that's not what the statistics say, and you love those don't you? <br>
<br>
&quot;And I will defend your right to deny the existence of God if you prefer, but don't expect me to share your views.&quot;<br>
<br>
But that's just it Michael, atheist are not forcing public school children to swear there is no god, theists to give money to orgs that promot atheism or otherwise violate your 1st amendment rights. These are the actions of theists--namely xians <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> (which you say you are not, so perhaps you embrace SOCAS as firmly as we). I don't just pay lipservice--I actually DEFEND your freedoms with my actions, money etc. I want us all free to disagree and not have to support financially any belief system or violate the rights of children with public money. I am so happy you agree with me and can join the struggle....<br>
<br>
until then, in case you didn't notice this is a debate board and we will argue with each other on any issues we find ourselves disagreeing on.

<br>
Wouldn't that depend on the nature and content of the experience?  You seem to be placing unneccessary constraints upon what constitutes &quot;scientific evidence&quot; and deciding to speak for the whole of the scientific community without benefit of knowledge related to the experiences themselves.  Any particular reason you are jumping to rash conclusions, or is that attitude more a statement of faith?<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;If these experiences are more than just a figment of my imagination, I would expect to see statistical validation of such things in the population as a whole and expect other to have similar experiences.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Not necessarily. Many claim to have had experiences with different gods or demons that most people would now not recognize as genuine. This neither validates nor disproves your personal experience. There are many perfectly sound scientific explanations for why people get warm and fuzzy<br>
<br>
First of all, I've had very specific information revealed to me through meditation which has later panned out once I researched the subjects in question.<br>
<br>
Do you mean the presense of love is a &quot;warm fuzzy&quot;, or a reality?  Are you using the term &quot;warm fuzzy&quot; to ridicule the idea or are you going to study the phenominon in earnest with an open and scientific mind?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;during prayer, see visions, hear voices in their heads, are healed from meditation and &quot;prayer&quot; and see lights and tunnels in near death experiences. Some are proof of mental illness<br>
<br>
It seems to me that you are going out of your way to frame this discussion around an arguement based entirely upon ridicule and ad homimem based on your use of language here.  It could equally be suggested that atheism is a form of &quot;mental illness&quot; since most people do experience the presense of God, and the few that do not might simply represent a form of mental illness.  This type of verbage is loaded and unproductive to a serious discussion IMO.  Why do you resort to it?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and others are merely explanations of why otherwise rational people<br>
<br>
Otherwise rational?  Again, your choice of terminology doesnt' seem particularly open minded or scientific.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;might experience &quot;events&quot; that can be interpreted as supernatural.<br>
<br>
I don't believe in the &quot;supernatural&quot; by the way.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You have not yet provided a shred of actual proof for any of these, though perhaps you are preparing to do so.<br>
<br>
What actual proof can you provide me for &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;love&quot;.  Perhaps if you demonstrate these empirically, I can demonstrate the presence of God for you.<br>
 <br>
M&gt;&gt;&quot;From talking with friends and family I know others have such experiences, and from the statical evidence that God is embraced by 80-90 percent of humanity, I think it's pretty well established that my group of friends is representative of the whole rather than a statistical minority.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;As are many of my friends. Tell me, Michael, if your friends all believed the earth was flat (as 80-90% of the planet once did)<br>
<br>
Can you demonstrate the truth of your claim that 80-90% of the planet once believed the earth was flat.  The Mayans certainly did not believe that, and even very primitive cultures have been demonstrated to have an increadible understanding of our universe long before the middle ages.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and they were a statistically valid representation of the population, would that make their claim of a flat earth scientifically valid?<br>
<br>
Once I see your reference, we'll talk.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;How do you validate your opinions?&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Well depends which opinions. My opinion that onions taste good needs no validation--it's subjective and personal.<br>
<br>
How about your opinion that God doesn't exist?  What scientific evidence can you provide to support that opinion?<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;Are you dismissing these experiences out of hand without knowing what they are?&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;No, I am dismissing your use of them as &quot;proof&quot; or evidence of a supernatural power. This is laughable..HAHAHA  <br>
<br>
It seems to me that unless you understand what the experience is, you are simply jumping to conclusions based upon your own personal faith.  I see nothing very enlightened or scientific about that attitude.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;If I have them and you do not, is that evidence that your LACK of experience is representative of the whole?&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;No, it is proof of my mental stability.<br>
<br>
Again, your use of such language suggests you are anything but fair or unbaised in your particular brand of faith.  Welcome to fundy atheism.  It's the flipside of fundy theism.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I am sorry to hear you are delusional<br>
<br>
How would you know that?  Faith?  How do you know that your personal lack of experience with God isn't due to your closed attitude and particular belief set?  Blind faith?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and sorrier to hear you are embracing this as evidence of contact with an imaginary sky daddy, but hey--whatever numbs you to reality.<br>
<br>
Well mama, whatever floats your boat too.  The problem here with your particular belief set is that you are trying to take the scientific high ground without doing any research.  Couch potato science isn't exactly very becomming on you either I might add.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;Is that a &quot;scientific&quot; way of studying a subject?&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Yes Michael. Apparently you have limited exposure to science or scientific experimentation if you believe that it involves gathering one's &quot;personal experiences&quot; and feelings and then drawing sweeping conclusions with dire and eternal consequences.<br>
<br>
When did I say anything about dire eternal consequences?<br>
<br>
You aren't the final arbitrator of the meaning and application of science.  Psychology is also a &quot;science&quot; and it is based PURELY on &quot;personal experience&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Science is logical, methodical and objective.<br>
<br>
Which clearly you are not.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;That is how I would approach studying a subject.<br>
<br>
You clearly aren't doing any such thing based upon your lingo and attitude.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;Dismissing that out of hand too? Did you read anything from the author I suggested before concluding it was worthless, or is this another statement of faith on your part?&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I don't have to dismiss this &quot;out of hand&quot;, I have read many reincarnation books, including eastern ones and am familiar with Hindu and other major belief systems. I don't believe them,<br>
<br>
So your disbelief (faith) allows you to ridicule the idea?  How amusing.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;nor has anyone yet proven reincarnation. <br>
<br>
Well, if you'd read any of the books written by the author I suggested, I'd say you MIGHT have second thoughts about that.  Then again, with your current fundy attitude, you don't seem open to any type of evidence that undermines your particular faith.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I do have pagan friends who belive in this in a sort of Jonathon Bach way, but they don't have proof either. <br>
<br>
It seems you require a greater amount of proof of reincarnation or God than you do for say consciousness or love.  Why?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;They just &quot;feel&quot; it and don't pretend this &quot;feeling&quot; equals scientific evidence.<br>
<br>
Are feelings a part of reality?<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;Can you demonstrate that this &quot;opinion&quot; of yours is any more valid than mine, or are you just using ridicule as an arguement?&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Which opinion?<br>
<br>
That these things aren't valid or real?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;That you put faith in phantom fears or that logic and reason are what I choose?<br>
<br>
What fear?  I embraced my fear of death and anihilation when I was 15 and embraced atheism.<br>
<br>
What logic have you used?  So far your attitude only seems to reflect your personal fear of being wrong.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Or is it that I defend your right to be irrational?<br>
<br>
How can you prove that I am being &quot;irrational&quot;?  Is that another statement of faith?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; This is not opinion.<br>
<br>
Sure it is.  You've not &quot;proven&quot; anything through science.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Faith is neither rational nor logical and those who embrace it pride themselves on the absence of proof here.<br>
<br>
Have I done that?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Believing with no good evidence and in the face of reason is what faith is--some are proud of this--I am not one of them.<br>
<br>
I haven't seen any &quot;good evidence&quot; to support your opinions on these topics.  What exactly is &quot;good evidence&quot;?  How would one use such good evidence to demonstrate consciousness or love?<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;I'd love to see how you've deduced these issues to be &quot;anecdotal fairy tales&quot; without ever researching them. I fail to see how you can claim that's logical or reasonable.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;And here you assume I have no research. On what basis do you assume this? <br>
<br>
I assume you haven't done so with an open mind based on your attitude.  How would you explain these events?  What books have you read on these subjects that make you such an expert?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;There are thousands of years of history and mythology/fairy tales/religion to back up my claim....how do you sort the fairty tales out?<br>
<br>
Name me one conclusively demonstrateable fairytale that has been held by the human race with 80-90 percent acceptence for thousands of years.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt;&quot;The last medical study I cited here did not have a medical explanation to offer. Do you have a scientific study that explains all these experiences adequatly, or is this just another &quot;opinion&quot; of yours?&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Yes, I will get them for you as soon as I am able, as mine are all hard copy.<br>
<br>
I'd certainly be interested in reading them.  I've never seen a scientific study that came close to explaining all these experiences.<br>
<br>
M&gt;You got me honey---lamenting your ignorance and refusal to use reason on a debate board. Guilty and probably guilty again.<br>
<br>
More ad hominems eh?  Do you figure that's likely to impress me?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Note that I did not dismiss your argument totally or refuse to respond based on this, just sad to see you're not the man I'd hoped to go head to head with that's all...<br>
<br>
Sorry to disappoint you.  Then again, you aren't exactly impressing me much either with that attitude of yours.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I'm sure it's not the crushing blow to your ego you are pretending it is....or does Mama mean that much to you <br>
<br>
I don't recall suggesting it was a &quot;crushing blow&quot;, I was simply surpised to see you jumping to such rash conclusions based on a couple of posts.  Oh well.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;So far I'm not all that impressed with the athiests I've met here, and I'm not much impressed with my own stint as an atheist in my youth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Then leave.<br>
<br>
Must I?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;And sorry to hear how you are disappointed with yourself in your youth.<br>
<br>
I'm disappointed with many things about my youth.  Wisdom often comes with age.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I'm not that proud of being a mindless theist as a child,  but then indoctrination and fear are powerful weapons used by the religionists and I was very small. <br>
<br>
Yes, I experienced that too.  Embracing death was a powerful fear I had to overcome. Embracing ego death and finding God for real was much tougher.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;I'm simply noting that theism and criminal activity are not one and the same concept, and atheists commit crimes as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Duh, but they commit them less often and stay married longer and are more successful and intelligent in general.<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting for your proof of such claims by the way.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure which is the cause and which is the effect, but quit acting like atheists are all just too stupid, uninformed or arrogant to believe in a diety and you'll get farther. <br>
<br>
Did I claim those things or are you putting words in my mouth?<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;Perhaps you have a study you'd like to cite for me that filters out the affects of &quot;education&quot; from the notion of atheistic beliefs as it relates to these statistics?&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Several actuallywww.objectivethought.com/...stats.html<br>
and the Barna study on marriage conducted by theists<br>
www.skeptictank.org/gen2/gen00101.htm<br>
<br>
I'll read them over and see what I think afterwards.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;Or perhaps theism is healthier for humans and atheism is just irrelevant.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Only that's not what the statistics say, and you love those don't you? <br>
<br>
Well, they do reveal patterns.  Then again while you embrace SOME statistics, you ignore those that you don't like.  I suppose I could just be like you and do the same, jump to the conclusions I wish to hear and ignore all the rest.  Fortunately I seem to prefer to actually consider ideas before blowing them off.<br>
<br>
M&gt;&quot;And I will defend your right to deny the existence of God if you prefer, but don't expect me to share your views.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;But that's just it Michael, atheist are not forcing public school children to swear there is no god,<br>
<br>
Who is forcing you or any child to even say the pledge?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;theists to give money to orgs that promot atheism or otherwise violate your 1st amendment rights.<br>
<br>
Am I doing that, or are you blaming me for the sins of others?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;These are the actions of theists--namely xians  (which you say you are not, so perhaps you embrace SOCAS as firmly as we).<br>
<br>
I believe there should be separation between church and state, but theism has always permiated american culture.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I don't just pay lipservice--I actually DEFEND your freedoms with my actions, money etc. I want us all free to disagree and not have to support financially any belief system or violate the rights of children with public money. I am so happy you agree with me and can join the struggle....<br>
<br>
I doubt I'll be joining your organization real soon.  You've already &quot;uninvited&quot; me from this board. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I'm happy being here and debating these issues with you folks as long as it's honest and open minded debate.  I don't do a lot of fundy Xtian boards because they tend to be closed minded.  Fundies though come in all flavors, and so far this board seems as closed minded as any theistic board I've ever been on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Michael</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(2/13/03 7:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Mama, mama, mama</span><hr size=1> First reference...<br>

<br>
2. Hilding Carlsojn, 1933<br>
Study of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>215 students</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> showed that &quot;there is a tendency for the more intelligent undergraduate to be sympathetic toward… atheism.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's really the most pitiful &quot;study&quot; I've ever seen referenced before. The ***TINY*** numbers of case studies are anything but representative of the whole of even the campus where the study occured.   I'm utterly appauled you'd even cite such studies.<br>
<br>
As to your second reference, it at least involved 4000 participants though that too seems like a pretty small number to be making blanket statements over.  Even still, if you are a practicing Catholic you have the same likelihood of staying married as any atheist.  I hardly think a few percentage points one way or the other demonstrates that atheists are happier or healthier overall than their theistic counterparts.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/13/03 7:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Mikey, Mikey, Mikey</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is a logical fallacy known as the Argument from Authority. <br>
&gt;&gt; Which I didn't do.<br>
<br>
Allow me to quote you, “the bottom line reality is that both Einstein and I believe(d) in a creator.”  Argument from Authority – Guilty.<br>
<br>
==================================<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Is your understanding so limited that you think there is an either/or relationship here?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Yes. Either one believes in a creator or one does not. Einstein clearly did. You do not.<br>
<br>
Okay, based on your reasoning, one either believes in gods or doesn’t.  From there, the group of ‘Those who believe’ is divided into camps of ‘Deist’ and ‘Theist’.  These two things are different systems.  You have some trouble on this point. As has been said, and confirmed by deists, their website and literature, deists believe in a god, but do not think he continues to be active or involved.  He has not revealed his will to anyone. He is not personally involved.  He is not meddling in our day to day life.  He is not waiting to punish OR reward. (At this point you will start to sputter and interject something about me speaking for all deists, and I submit that, if a person calls themselves a deist, but does not ascribe to these beliefs, they are not actually a deist, they are just calling themselves the wrong thing.)  The moment god shows his hand, reveals what he wants from us, grants us an ‘experience’, dictates a bible, it becomes theology.  It adopts a dogma.  It becomes disprovable.<br>
<br>
Einstein said: <br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” See how this suggests he followed the deist ideology more than theist? <br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” See the implications of your heaven idea?<br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” See how god DOESN’T enter into his decisions?<br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Spiritualism is for me no more than a symptom of weakness and confusion.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” See how this reflects on his views?<br>
<br>
(when asked if he believed in immortality) “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No, and one life is enough for me</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.”<br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” Again, the distancing of himself from theism.<br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility. This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing to do with mysticism.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” This may clarify your misconception about hairsplitting and definitions.  Certainly it speaks of what he felt was genuine feeling vs false mysticism. <br>
<br>
==================================<br>
<br>
As far as the studies go, I am not sure what you think our colleges were like in the late 1920’s and early 30’s but if I recall depression economics, those numbers probably reflect a substantial proportion of the campus.  All that aside, if you wish to refute the study, please roll out a study that shows other data or better diligence.  You can snear and deride (you do it so regularly) as much as you like, but you haven’t refuted it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I don't believe in the &quot;supernatural&quot; by the way.<br>

You have the most bizarre views of the world imaginable.  You believe in god and heaven, but not the supernatural?  What exactly qualifies as supernatural in your world?<br>

As has been said, and confirmed by deists, their website and literature, deists believe in a god, but do not think he continues to be active or involved.<br>
<br>
They do however believe he created reality and is something they tend to discuss.  So according to your definition that YOU PERSONALLY provided, they can in fact be categorized as &quot;theists.&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;... I submit that, if a person calls themselves a deist, but does not ascribe to these beliefs, they are not actually a deist, they are just calling themselves the wrong thing.)<br>
<br>
I didn't say that.  I said deism is a subset of &quot;theism&quot;, which is itself distinctly different from an atheist.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Einstein said:  “I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.” See how this suggests he followed the deist ideology more than theist? <br>
<br>
I see your reasoning and your reasoning on that point seems sound.  I do not however agree with your assesment of the term &quot;theist&quot;.  Theism only requires that you believe in a creator, regardless of whether or not you believe you can experience God personally.<br>
 <br>
“Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms” See the implications of your heaven idea?<br>
<br>
I don't believe what most folks think of their &quot;self identity&quot;, i.e. body, ego, belief systems, will survive physical death and the light of truth either, but I do believe we have &quot;souls&quot;.  Einstein also talked about souls and spirits quite often.  Why?<br>
<br>
“A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary.” See how god DOESN’T enter into his decisions?<br>
<br>
Yes, it's the credo I live by.  Your point?<br>
<br>
“Spiritualism is for me no more than a symptom of weakness and confusion.” See how this reflects on his views?<br>
<br>
I suppose that depends on how you define the term &quot;spiritualism&quot; and what context this sentence was used in.  Do you have a reference for that one?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;(when asked if he believed in immortality) “No, and one life is enough for me.”<br>
<br>
Ok.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;“In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God” Again, the distancing of himself from theism.<br>
<br>
Distancing himself from religion, not God.<br>

&gt;&gt;“What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility. This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing to do with mysticism.” This may clarify your misconception about hairsplitting and definitions. Certainly it speaks of what he felt was genuine feeling vs false mysticism. <br>
<br>
Of course he also said:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;The finest emotion of which we are capable is the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>mystic</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and lives in a state of fear is a dead man. To know that what is impenatrable for us really exists and manifests itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, whose gross forms alone are intelligible to our poor faculties - this knowledge, this feeling ... that is the core of the true religious sentiment. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>In this sense, and in this sense alone, I rank myself amoung profoundly religious men.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

&gt;&gt;As far as the studies go, I am not sure what you think our colleges were like in the late 1920’s and early 30’s but if I recall depression economics, those numbers probably reflect a substantial proportion of the campus. <br>
<br>
It's a pitiful study that didn't ask about theism vs. atheism, but only &quot;devotely religious&quot; vs. &quot;atheistic tendencies&quot; which leads to all kinds of interpretations as to meaning.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;All that aside, if you wish to refute the study, please roll out a study that shows other data or better diligence.<br>
<br>
I've yet to see anything to worth bothering to refute!  Why bother?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You can snear and deride (you do it so regularly) as much as you like, but you haven’t refuted it.<br>
<br>
Why do I need bother refuting a link that doesn't even ask pertinatent questions related to her claims.  <br>
<br>
M&gt;&gt; I don't believe in the &quot;supernatural&quot; by the way.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You have the most bizarre views of the world imaginable.<br>
<br>
How so?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You believe in god and heaven, but not the supernatural?<br>
<br>
No, I believe God is perfectly &quot;natural&quot;, in fact THE SINGLE MOST natural thing in creation.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What exactly qualifies as supernatural in your world?<br>
<br>
I dunno.  I don't much believe in the concept to start with, and I certainly don't believe in anything &quot;supernatural&quot;!<br>

&gt;&gt;Main Entry: su·per·nat·u·ral <br>
Pronunciation: &quot;sü-p&amp;r-'na-ch&amp;-r&amp;l, -'nach-r&amp;l<br>
Function: adjective<br>
Etymology: Medieval Latin supernaturalis, from Latin super- + natura nature<br>
Date: 15th century<br>
1 : of or relating to an order of existence beyond the visible observable universe; <br>
<br>
By this definition, atoms, electrons and neutrinos are &quot;supernatural&quot;.  I suppose maybe I do then believe in supernatural things afterall. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;especially : of or relating to God or a god, demigod, spirit, or devil<br>
<br>
Oh, so someone gets to decide that God is supernatural by their definition?  Does this mean that neutrino's are supernatural?  I've never seen one of those either.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;2 a : departing from what is usual or normal especially so as to appear to transcend the laws of nature b :<br>
<br>
I don't think God transends the laws of nature, though maybe it might &quot;appear&quot; that way.  Then again, a magnet floating above a superconductive plate &quot;appears&quot; to defy the laws of gravity too.  Is that a supernatural phenomenon too since it &quot;appears&quot; to defy the laws of gravity?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;attributed to an invisible agent (as a ghost or spirit)<br>
<br>
You mean like neutrinos?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Here comes the ad hominem.....you are a freak and a loony.<br>
<br>
I just love it when your superior intellect gets rude and uptight.  Do me a favor. Go stand under the stars tonight and tell me that you KNOW WITH CERTAINTY that this gigantic universe wasn't created intentionally.  Then tell me how you know this scientifically.   Until you do, I'll just figure you're blowing smoke and stuck in your own pitiful little ego.  How that for an ad hom on my part? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Michael</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(2/13/03 9:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Einstein and Spirit, mind and God</span><hr size=1> &quot;Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocre minds. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;If the possibility of the spiritual development of all individuals is to be secured, a second kind of outward freedom is necessary. The development of science and of the creative activities of the spirit in general requires still another kind of freedom, which may be characterised as inward freedom. It is this freedom of the spirit which consists in the interdependence of thought from the restrictions of authoritarian and social prejudices as well as from unphilosophical routinizing and habit in general. This inward freedom is an infrequent gift of nature and a worthy object for the individual.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason mastery demands all of a person.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I maintain that cosmic religiousness is the strongest and most noble driving force of scientific research.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Before God we are all equally wise - and equally foolish.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=86.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=86.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=86.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=86.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=86.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=86.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=86.topic&start=141&stop=141>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=86.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=86.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.threadControl?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=86.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="religiousdebate60574frm2">Debate Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm10">Christianity Discussions (G Rated)<option value="religiousdebate60574frm1">Announcements<option value="religiousdebate60574frm11">Test Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm5">Help Files</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574>religiousdebate</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2>Debate Forum</a> <font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
