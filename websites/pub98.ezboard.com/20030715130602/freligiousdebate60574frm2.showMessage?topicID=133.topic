It's been mentioned in passing in other threads but never directly discussed (or did I miss it?).  I hope a respectful and educational discourse can be had about it, but I've also seen things get extremely ugly even at a moderated board so I just kept hoping someone else would bring it up here...but I'm dying to get a discussion going about it here so I guess I'll just have to do the dirty work.<br>
<br>
For the record I had my first two sons circumcized and consider it one of the biggest parenting mistakes I've made (and not just because of the physical ramifications).  My most recent born son is intact and the process that brought to that point I consider to be a huge step forward for me, even a sort of &quot;born again&quot;* experience.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

GUIDE TO THE SCRIPTURES<br>
NATURAL MAN<br>
<br>
See also Born Again, Born of God; Carnal; Fall of Adam and Eve<br>
<br>
A person who chooses to be influenced by the passions, desires, appetites, and senses of the flesh rather than by the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Such a person can comprehend physical things but not spiritual things. All people are carnal, or mortal, because of the fall of Adam and Eve. Each person must be born again through the atonement of Jesus Christ to cease being a natural man.<br>
<br>
 The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit, 1 Cor. 2: 14. The natural man is an enemy to God and should be put off, Mosiah 3: 19. He that persists in his own carnal nature remaineth in his fallen state, Mosiah 16: 5 (Alma 42: 7-24; D&amp;C 20: 20). What natural man is there that knoweth these things? Alma 26: 19-22. Natural or carnal men are without God in the world, Alma 41: 11. Because of his transgression, man became spiritually dead, D&amp;C 29: 41. Neither can any natural man abide the presence of God, D&amp;C 67: 12. And man began to be carnal, sensual, and devilish, Moses 5: 13 (Moses 6: 49).<br>

So...though on the surface some people would say that this is a superficial thing (merely aesthetic preference or &quot;medical&quot; or &quot;hygeine&quot; related)...I think it actually drives right at the heart of the purpose of life.<br>
<br>
Anyway, so, anyone else want to discuss this from historical, religious, cultural and physical standpoints?  I would especially love to hear if anyone else who is Christian, but feels the way I do about this, has studied much about when it was used as a token of the covenant (like what it entailed exactly, why it was chosen, importance of token versus the actual spirit of the covenant, etc).  I have a few of my own ideas about this but I would really like to learn more, so I'm hoping someone out there will have a lot to say from that particular perspective.<br>

<br>
I guess that's what I'm getting at.  I know it is not a token of a covenant for Christians anymore, but I think the reasons why we may or may not choose it can be indicators for deeper things.  Hope that is making sense.  Thanks for the quick response!<br>

I know those are not exactly like circumcision, but examples of things that I am sure God has no opinion on.

<br>
I also feel that feeling too strongly about things like this is dangerous to your spirituality, I think it leads to thinking things like a person has received revelation that another should take as doctrine for the whole church.  If it isnt IN the doctrine, it isnt doctrine.  I feel so strongly about this because, dh and I have seen people in our own lives fall away from the church because they felt like the leaders had fallen, because they didnt &quot;know&quot; or teach the things that they felt should be doctrine from &quot;personal revelation.&quot;   <br>

<br>
I hear what you are saying Shirene.  I remember at one point thinking almost he same thing, that certainly the Prophets would say something about this if it was really something that mattered.  But at the same time, I could not deny what I was learning about the procedure, and as you know, saying that I do not think favorably of it is an undersatement.  This is not the only topic this has happened for me on either, where somethings I was somewhat ambivalent about at one points suddenly seems to have a very clear right or wrong for me as I learn more about it, and I wonder why on earth the Church leaders aren't saying anything more about it.  But not in the way that you implied, I know what you mean there, I've seen that happen too.  I mean more in a way of just trying to sort through things for myself and what I think about it from a moral and ethical standpoint and figuring out exactly how the Church is supposed to function as far as guidance in these areas.<br>
<br>
Anway, just wanted to share a couple of things that were good food for thought about that.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1995.htm/ensign%20october%201995.htm/a%20crisis%20a%20council%20and%20inspired%20leadership.htm?f=templates$fn=document-frame.htm$3.0$q=circumcision%20new%20testament$x=Simple#LPHit1">library.lds.org/nxt/gatew...ple#LPHit1</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is no doubt that Peter and the other Brethren knew that the law of Moses was fulfilled. (Latter-day revelation also makes it plain that the law of Moses was fulfilled in Christ; see, for example, 3 Ne. 15:4-5—the Savior’s comments to others who had been practicing the law—as well as Moro. 8:8 and D&amp;C 74.) Obedience to the law of Moses was no longer a requirement for salvation since Jesus had completed his atonement. Missionary work among the Gentile nations could go forth directly and without impediment. Yet still there was that conflict between the doctrine of the Church and Jewish culture. The long-standing cultural tradition persisted among many Jewish members for years, even after the doctrinal question was settled.<br>
<br>
In like manner today, there may be questions on which the doctrinal foundation is clear but on which tradition or custom are so strong that the Brethren are impressed not to take a firmer stand, trusting, as did Church leaders in New Testament times, that if the basic revealed principles are known, the Holy Ghost will eventually lead the adherents to forsake their tradition, or academic popularity, or peer pressure in favor of the word of God.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It is the responsibility of prophets to teach the word of God—not to spell out every jot and tittle of human behavior. Our moral agency requires us to know good from evil and choose the good.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It is our responsibility.  That is part of the purupose of this life and why we have agency, so we can come to know for ourselves, not just follow an arbitrary list of instructions with no understanding for ourselves of the principles they are based on or development of our own will.<br>
<br>
I agree that there are some things (like what color the paint the walls <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) that God does not have an opinion on, but that does not mean that God has given through his Prophets and exhaustive list of behaviours that we should or should not engage in, again, because ability to discern what is moral and what is not and then act accordingly is exactly what he wants us to develop within ourselves.<br>
<br>
Earlier in Elder Fausts talk (the second one I quoted) he said &quot; The Church counsel in this matter has been clear for many years.&quot;  I think there are a lot of things where we don't see the forest for the trees.  People look for a specific &quot;policy&quot; about some sort of practical application when the principles they are based on are being taught right and left.  I think circumcision falls into this category.<br>
<br>
What I have learned about it is that it was not &quot;made up&quot; by God to used as a token.  Genital &quot;marking&quot; (cutting, mutilation....take your pick) was going on in other cultures as well.  (See the LDS Bible Dictionary)  It was something brought in as a token after the people would not remember using other means.  Personally I think it was more that God resorted to using something base enough to reach the people he was working with.  They were in a very carnal state, and so a very carnal token was used.  It wasn't that it was something Godly that God passed down to man, it was something extremely Carnal that God resorted to as a tool when people would not respond to other methods (I'v touched on this in other threads, but I do believe that God works with man in ways which we are ready for, not because He is weak, but because we are and He wants us to develop through agency, which means sometimes &quot;lower laws&quot; were and are given).<br>
<br>
It became popular in the largely non-Jewish United States as a supposed cure for Masterbation which was thought at the time to cause any number of things from blindness to paralysis.  It did not cure masterbation and we now know that masturbation does not cause those things, yet this very powerful carnal tradition continues to perpetuate itself today under the guise of hygeine and medical benefit for the disease du jour (sp?).<br>
<br>
To prove my point, I would ask whether or not it seems reasonable to gather a sample group of youg women and have their labia cut away (in clean conditions and with adequate anesthia even, which not all infant boys are given for circ here right now).  We could then test to see if this would increase hygeine, save them time in the shower, small better, be easier to care for when they are elderly, decrease (evein if ever so minutely) any type of yeast or urinary tract infections and STDs, and let's not forget to see if men simply find it more attractive or if it &quot;tastes better&quot;.<br>
<br>
Seems like an absurd and even offensive proposal, yet that is what has been done with male circumcision.  The only difference is that it was already going on.  But if something isn't a good reason to start it, then is it a good excuse to continue it?<br>
<br>
OK...It's late and I'm rambling, but I basically wanted to brush upon why I think this is something that runs deep enough that it is something that God does care about.  I believe it is painful and harmful and I think, like I said, when we take a closer look at the context it is happening in we can learn a lot about ourselves and where we stand as far as having overcome the &quot;natural man.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to seeing what is added here tomorrow.<br>

<br>
I should clarify that it is *strongly recommended*, and is a general, preferred practice among Muslims.  However, it is not *required*, you do not become a non-Muslim simply by not being circumcized.  The discussion of circumcision is found in the hadiths, not in the Qur'an itself.  It is seen as 1) following the tradition of Abraham and 2) part of general personal hygiene.  <br>

<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/birth.htm#Brit">www.jewfaq.org/birth.htm#Brit</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Brit Milah: Circumcision <br>
Of all of the commandments in Judaism, the brit milah (literally, Covenant of Circumcision) is probably the one most universally observed. It is commonly referred to as a bris (covenant, using the Ashkenazic pronunciation). Even the most secular of Jews, who observe no other part of Judaism, almost always observe these laws. Of course, until quite recently, the majority of males in the United States were routinely circumcised, so this doesn't seem very surprising. But keep in mind that there is more to the ritual of the brit milah than merely the process of physically removing the foreskin, and many otherwise non-observant Jews observe the entire ritual. <br>
<br>
The commandment to circumcise is given at Gen. 17:10-14 and Lev. 12:3. The covenant was originally made with Abraham. It is the first commandment specific to the Jews. <br>
<br>
Circumcision is performed only on males. Although some cultures have a practice of removing all or part of the woman's clitoris, often erroneously referred to as &quot;female circumcision,&quot; that ritual has never been a part of Judaism. <br>
<br>
Like so many Jewish commandments, the brit milah is commonly perceived to be a hygienic measure; however the biblical text states the reason for this commandment quite clearly: circumcision is an outward physical sign of the eternal covenant between G-d and the Jewish people. It is also a sign that the Jewish people will be perpetuated through the circumcised man. The health benefits of this practice are merely incidental. It is worth noting, however, that circumcised males have a lower risk of certain cancers, and the sexual partners of circumcised males also have a lower risk of certain cancers. <br>
<br>
The commandment is binding upon both the father of the child and the child himself. If a father does not have his son circumcised, the son is obligated to have himself circumcised as soon as he becomes an adult. A person who is uncircumcised suffers the penalty of kareit, spiritual excision; in other words, regardless of how good a Jew he is in all other ways, a man has no place in the World to Come if he is uncircumcised. <br>
<br>
Circumcision is performed on the eighth day of the child's life, during the day. The day the child is born counts as the first day, thus if the child is born on a Wednesday, he is circumcised on the following Wednesday. Keep in mind that Jewish days begin at sunset, so if the child is born on a Wednesday evening, he is circumcised the following Thursday. Circumcisions are performed on Shabbat, even though they involve the drawing of blood which is ordinarily forbidden on shabbat. The Bible does not specify a reason for the choice of the eighth day; however, modern medicine has revealed that an infant's blood clotting mechanism stabilizes on the eighth day after birth. As with almost any commandment, circumcision can be postponed for health reasons. Jewish law provides that where the child's health is at issue, circumcision must wait until seven days after a doctor declares the child healthy enough to undergo the procedure. <br>
<br>
Circumcision involves surgically removing the foreskin of the penis. The circumcision is performed by a mohel (lit. circumciser; rhymes with oil), a pious, observant Jew educated in the relevant Jewish law and in surgical techniques. Circumcision performed by a regular physician does not qualify as a valid brit milah, regardless of whether a rabbi says a blessing over it, because the removal of the foreskin is itself a religious ritual that must be performed by someone religiously qualified. <br>
<br>
If the child is born without a foreskin (it happens occasionally), or if the child was previously circumcised without the appropriate religious intent or in a manner that rendered the circumcision religiously invalid, a symbolic circumcision may be performed by taking a pinprick of blood from the tip of the penis. This is referred to as hatafat dam brit. <br>
<br>
While the circumcision is performed, the child is held by a person called a sandek. In English, this is often referred to as a godfather. It is an honor to be a sandek for a bris. The sandek is usually a grandparent or the family rabbi. Traditionally, a chair (often an ornate one) is set aside for Elijah, who is said to preside over all circumcisions. Various blessings are recited, including one over wine, and a drop of wine is placed in the child's mouth. The child is then given a formal Hebrew name. <br>
<br>
It is not necessary to have a minyan for a bris, but it is desirable if feasible. <br>
<br>
As with most Jewish life events, the ritual is followed by refreshments or a festive meal. <br>
<br>
The Circumcision Controversy <br>
In recent times, circumcision has become controversial. Some have hypothesized that infant circumcision has harmful psychological effects and may cause sexual dysfunction. Many websites have sprung up promoting this point of view, and even in Israel there are those who want to outlaw circumcision as child abuse. <br>
<br>
To the best of my knowledge, there is no concrete, scientific evidence that circumcision has any harmful effect. The rate of complications from circumcision is one of the lowest of all surgical procedures, and the most common complication is simply excessive bleeding. At most, the latest scientific evidence indicates that the health benefits of circumcision are not as great as previously assumed, thus there is no reason to perform routine circumcisions for the purposes of hygiene. However, as stated above, Jewish circumcision is not performed for the purpose of hygiene. <br>
<br>
From the traditional Jewish point of view, there is no controversy. The ritual of circumcision was commanded by our Creator, and He certainly knows what is and is not good for us. The G-d who commanded us not to harm ourselves certainly would not command us to do something harmful to ourselves, and even if He did, the observant Jew would nonetheless heed His wishes. <br>
<br>
For more information on the traditional Jewish response to the circumcision controversy, see Bris Milah: Beautiful or Barbaric? at Aish ha-Torah's website. <br>

I observe Judaism more from a &quot;cultural&quot; standpoint, so that is why I didn't try to explain any of this myself.  I didn't even do a bris for my son, but if he feels that he missed out, then he can do whatever he needs to when he is old enough to make the decision.  My dh and I decided that we want our children to choose their own religious path anyway.  Maybe it would have been nice for me to do the bris for his circ so he didn't have to mess with it later if he did decide to follow Judaism, but we just didn't really think about it at the time.  We felt comfortable just having the doctor do it at the hospital, and then they could monitor any complications (of which there were none).  <br>
<br>
I also wanted to point out that Judaism and Islam share many similar rituals.  Circumcision is just one of those, eventhough Jews seem more strict about it than Muslims.  I believe there are similar dietary laws as well.  Kate can correct me here, but I think halach is the term used by Muslims for what Jews call kosher.  Then again, maybe I'm thinking of a whole different term.  Is it halal? Sorry to botch that Kate.  As you can see, I have enough trouble keeping track of what my own rituals are supposed to be.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
It's called &quot;halal&quot;, and it's not as strict as the Jewish kosher law, I *think*.  If we're talking about meat, my understanding is that kosher meat has to be salted or something to make sure all the blood is removed? (please correct me if I'm wrong)  In Islam, it must be slaughtered in a certain way and drained of blood, but no extra measures on top of that.<br>
<br>
There are some dietary laws, but again not as strict as the kosher laws, like the meat and dairy thing.  Muslims are able to eat Kosher meat, as they are just as strict -- if not more so -- than many Muslims.  Actually, you'll find some Muslims making a distinction between halaal meat, by which they mean anything that isn't pork, and dhahabi meat, meaning ritually slaughtered meat.  The difference is that some will say you can eat at McDonalds or wherever, as long as there's no pork; while others say you can only eat meat that is ritually slaughtered, which means no McDonalds.<br>
<br>
As with many things, there's a range as to how seriously people follow this.  I'm at the stricter end <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have never kept kosher, and even a lot my family members who are obervant don't keep kosher.  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure about the salting thing.  I know that the animal is required to be slaughtered in a certain way.  It is a real quick slice to the throat, and then all the blood drains out.  If I see kosher meat as an option, then I will usually choose it because I know it is closely inspected for parasites and such, and you are getting it pretty fresh.  I think there is a rabbi involved somehow for these inspections.  I'm not sure about the qualifications or anything.  You see, I suck at this.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Even Jews who keep kosher do it at different levels.  An ultra-Orthodox Jew will even use seperate dishes for meat and dairy.  Other Jews just try to do their best to not mix meat and dairy, or consume pork or shellfish.  Then there are people like me with a freezer full of pork chops.  If anyone is really curious as to how the process works, then the Jewish Families board at BC is very nice about answering questions.  Respectful questions are welcome anytime.  <br>
<br>
The other thing I can tell you about keeping kosher is that there are very spiritual reasons involved.  Jews do not like to mix the aspects of life and death, and they are also pushing respect for all &quot;God's creatures&quot;, and that is why they don't like to mix the meat of a dead animal with the milk that is supposed to nourish the animal's baby.  I would also like to share that the &quot;kosher tax&quot; is a myth.  A lot of people are up in arms over the thought of a cost being passed on to those who don't observe Judaism.  The cost of certifying food as kosher is very small, and when that is distributed over all the products, then it comes out to almost nothing.  Most companies won't even calculate the kosher cost because it is so minimal, and therefore a waste of the company's time.  Bird's Eye did calculate the cost, and it came out to 65 millionths of a penny per product.  When you consider the fact that a kosher certification attracts more people, thereby increasing revenues, one can argue that there is more of a gain to the general public than a loss for purchasing a particular kosher product.  I just thought I'd throw that in since observant Jews get attacked for supposedly passing off the cost of their religion to the public.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Previously, one of the most common justifications for circumcision was the inability to retract the foreskin (phimosis) of a newborn. It is a normal condition of the newborn male not to be able to retract the foreskin. The American Academy of Pediatrics task force found that about 90% of uncircumcised males are able to retract their foreskin by age 5. If your son's foreskin cannot be retracted after puberty, his doctor may suggest circumcision as a treatment.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Now, there is a 1 in 10 chance this can occur to a child.  Add to that the incidence of Priapism (frequent or prolonged erections) that runs in the family and you have what happened to my nephews that were not circumsized.  While it may happen to the general population 1 out of 10 time, it tends to run in a family and we are that 1 in 10 family, so it happens to us 10 out of 10 times.  The skin will not retract either for failing to detach or not being sufficiently elastic to permit the passage of the glans through before full engorgement, or tearing the skin in the process.  You can imagine how painful this is for a child.  <br>
<br>
My son expresses all the symptoms his father, his cousins and uncles did that reaffirm my decision.  He frequently has ‘system checks’ for no reason for extended periods throughout the day.  He has had them to my knowledge his whole life, and since he is only 3 now it is doubtful that surgery would be offered because he hadn’t passed the age for ordinary detachment.  My brother did not circ his sons and it was very traumaticfor them all.  Kids waking up crying at night or unexpectedly throughout the day, doctors declining surgery because it is a far more risky procedure at a later date than when new-born or adult.  Bleeding, infection, fear, embarrassment, nothing a new father wants to wait for his son to go through.<br>

If you are equating blindness to the loss of that little flap of skin, I would call that an unjust comparison if taken to the level of identicalness (beyond awareness of the condition) and I can say from personal experience, guys don’t walk up and discuss it, point it out in public or dwell on it.  You can ask every co-worker I have and maybe 2 of them can tell you if I am circed, but we ALL know who the blind guy is on the first floor.  <br>
<br>
My dislike of the comparison to blindness is based on proportionality.  It is frequently a ‘mountain out of a foreskin’ when debated about the impacts and the tragic horror or abomination being done.  I would equate it to a vestigal tail (as some are fond of trying to ridicule) in that it is a surgical process removing tissues and bears little difference later on in life.  I would also compare it socially to piercing a girl’s ears or the prophylactic removal of tonsils or wisdom teeth.  Can you argue that the person is irrevocably changed in all those instances?  Sure.  Can I argue that those changes are fairly insignificant?  Sure.  <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> You are right DBC. If Rick was circed at 30, he might expect the same level of keratinization by the time he is 60, that he would have had at 30 if he'd been circed at birth. DBC, relax and open your mind for a second. Take a deep breath. Now, run your tongue against the inside of your cheek. THAT is roughly the equivalent of the texture your glans would be if it were protected by a foreskin your entire life. Now imagine sex with that sensitive, tender tool and ask yourself, &quot;why not&quot;?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Okay, by this line of reasoning, my glans would be more like a hoof than a glans after 60 years of keratinization.  The process is not unending; deteriorating yearly until you have a knob of granite klunking around.  In fact, during sex (once lubricated) it does remarkably feel like the cheek as you pointed out.  This is also in keeping with both personal inquiry and statistics about the impacts.  You notice the difference when you get started, but once in full swing it is the same.

My mind is open, despite allegations to the contrary.  I do not claim that many do this without research.  I do not claim that it can be decided arbitrarily in many cases.  I only claim that it was the right choice for us, the impacts are not as debilitating as the propaganda poured out would have us believe, and that there in fact ARE valid medical decisions that when considered arrive at the choice to circ.<br>
