~ Duncan’s House, Bayville, Mass., Nighttime... ~<br>
<br>
The pulse of techno beats rumbled from the speakers of the house-stereo filled the air... On the lawn and the street, cars were parked in semi-ordered rows, while teenagers used them for perches, welcoming late-comers to the bash.<br>
<br>
It was Friday night, and once again, Duncan’s was the place to be.<br>
<br>
Inside, the tastefully decorated main room was altered by recently placed party-lighting, throwing swirling colors along the walls that flashed and danced along with the beat. Speaking of dancing, the center of the living room was dance-central; packed with the gyrating bodies of teenaged boys and girls weaving and grinding to the techno-pulse rythms.<br>
<br>
Laughter and the chatter of conversation filtered through the music, as some of Bayville High’s student population sought to kick of another weekend away from school and other responsibilities.<br>
<br>
Amid the noise and motion, a slim form dressed in subdued, goth-like clothing moved in between the clusters of party-goers. Her streaked, dark-auburn hair and darker eye shadow and lipstick enhancing her ensemble, Rogue tried not to bump into anyone. A hard-pressed task, considering how crowded Duncan’s home had become.<br>
<br>
“Mercy! Things are going all out... can’t really blame anyone,” she admitted to herself. “The last set of exams were a real monster! After that sort of grind... guess it’s time to unwind for a spell.” Rogue sighed. Unwinding from exams was part of the game plan, but with her extra duties as an X-Man, this seemed to the needed tonic for all that was stressing her lately.<br>
<br>
“This really isn’t my kind of scene... still, gotta thank Scott for bringing me here...” Ever alert to the student grapevine, Scott and a few of the other Institute students had heard of the shindig. She’d been moping around in the mansion, when they cornered her and brought her along for the ride.<br>
<br>
“Well, maybe this won’t be so bad,” she admitted. “I think I was gonna go stir crazy, just loafing around in the mansion.”<br>
<br>
Just then, Duncan and his jock buddies rumbled by, whooping and slapping each other on the back as they crowded around the refreshment table.<br>
<br>
Snorting, Rogue muttered, “Guess even the Neanderthal Clan managed to pass their exams.” She sidestepped a straggler in a red-and-yellow letterman jacket, who’d nearly brushed the back of his hand against her cheek when he waved to Duncan. “Man! This power of mine can be a curse sometimes,” she sigh, relieved when he was past her.<br>
<br>
“Woo-HOO! Who’s ready to try to beat Bayville’s best at foozeball?” Duncan crowed, grinning at his assembled athletes.<br>
<br>
“I’m game if you are, Dunc!”<br>
“Yeah! Tourney-match for the Pride of Bayville!”<br>
“C’mon, let’s get ready to RUMBLE!”<br>
<br>
Duncan and his cronies rolled away from the tables holding the spread party snacks: mobbing the dance floor as they continued to laugh and joke about beating each other as they headed for the game room.<br>
<br>
“Talk about testosterone-overload!”Wrinkling her nose, Rogue ambled towards the tables herself. “Good thing the pack moved on... how’s a gal supposed to get anything to wet her whistle?” She paused to snag a handful of chips, munching on the salty snacks before she scooped up a cupful of the ruby-red punch sitting in the punch bowl nearby.<br>
<br>
“Hey! Check it,” a guy on the other side of the table said, grinning to a girl behind him, “Someone added some extra kick to the libations!” He held up two cups, handing one over to the girl as they walked towards a cluster of people talking on the fringes of the dance floor.<br>
<br>
Blinking, Rogue looked down at the cup in her hand. “Extra kick?” She lifted it to her face, sniffing the contents before screwing her face up at the smell of alcohol fumes. “Eww, they spiked it!” She started to set the cup down, but several people suddenly arrived at the table, forcing her to move away before she could come into contact with any of them.<br>
<br>
“Geez! Don’t everyone go nuts... it’s only booze,” Rogue griped, moving away from the crowd and into a darkened hallway, leading deeper into the house. “Man... I really shouldn’t be here,” she muttered. Not wanting to head back into the music and noise, she looked down the hall with a frown. “Well, it’s either this or work my way through the crowds to get outside.” She paused then stepped further inside, nibbling on the remainder of her chips.<br>
<br>
#<br>
<br>
Deeper in, the noise from the music faded somewhat. Sighing with relief, Rogue paused to lean against a wall. “Peace and quiet,” she told herself. “Well, as much as you can get at one of Duncan’s shindigs.” She finished off the last of the chips, licking her lips to get the salty taste off of them. This made her thirsty, so on reflex, she started to lift the cup in her hand.<br>
<br>
“Woah,” she gulped, only realizing at the last second that it still contained the doctored drink. “Crud, I should dump this before I poison myself! No telling what Duncan’s boys poured into it!” She looked around for some place to dispose of it... but no planters or nick-knack tables were handy. Holding the cup away from her, she poked her head around a bend in the hallway, hoping to find a bathroom or some spare room to leave it in...<br>
<br>
That’s when she discovered that others were using the quiet of the house to get away...<br>
<br>
“Oh!” she gasped, only muffling herself when what she witnessed burned its way into her brain: two bodies, dressed in weekend, typical teenager attire, were tucked away in a corner at the end of the hall. They had both sets of arms wrapped around each eager body, pulling themselves in for a close-up clinch.<br>
<br>
Swell, thought Rogue, as the sounds of sighs of pleasure drifted to her ears. I go from one party to another. Only I’m not invited to this one! Not that it would matter if I was... one touch, and lover boy there’d be locked in a coma. She frowned, remembering the first boy she ever kissed; Cody. It had been that first touch between them that had revealed Rogue’s mutancy, and changed her life forever...<br>
<br>
The kissing sounds got louder: soft smacking sounds as the two lovers were upping the ante. Geez, get a room you guys! Rogue half-smirked silently.She started to pull away, not wanting to break the couple up...<br>
<br>
“Oh,Scott...”<br>
<br>
Rogue froze. That voice!<br>
<br>
Blinking, she looked back and stared harder, realizing too late that this wasn’t some nameless pair of students, looking to cop some feels in private. This was Scott Summers and Jean Grey! the slim, serious young man and the beautiful redhead who had been Xavier’s first students...<br>
<br>
Who were, from the sounds they were making it clear to Rogue that they’d dropped all pretence between them, and that they’d been at this for sometime.<br>
<br>
“Jean...” The light smack of a kiss followed Scott’s murmuring of Jean’s name.<br>
<br>
Mortified, Rogue couldn’t bring herself to look away. She watched as Scott’s hands moved with soft, loving caresses over Jean’s clothed form. Jean reciprocated, rubbing her slim hands over Scott’s back in slow, languid trails. The tall field-leader of the X-Men had never hidden his fondness for the team’s red-haired TP/TK wielder... this much Rogue knew. The fact that it was evident they wanted to up the ante and make their relationship even closer...<br>
<br>
Rogue felt the blood race through her temples, a hot flash running along her body as she remained locked in place.<br>
This was the first time that she’d ever seen the two of them in close, intimate contact. Every fiber of her good sense screamed at her to turn away and leave her two team-mates alone. Yet, a tiny part of her, the one that still had feelings for the lanky, dark-haired mutant snogging away in front of her... that part made her fervently wish it was her in Scott’s arms, kissing him back like Jean was.<br>
<br>
“...mmmm,” Jean purred, running her hand up into Scott’s hair as they began to move closer together.<br>
<br>
Shaking her head, Rogue swallowed past the heavy knot in her throat. Her breath sounded loud in her ears, certain that any moment either of her friends would hear that they weren’t alone in the dark. Finally, getting her feet to respond, she backed away from the two lovers, ducking around the corner before turning away and tip-toeing back towards the party.<br>
<br>
When she was sure she’d gotten out of their range of hearing, she let out the breath she’d been holding back, letting it explode between her trembling lips. “Geez-us!” she moaned, a sad tone coloring her exclamation of pained emotion. Her mind pinwheeling around like mad, she sought to calm herself... even though two thoughts were bubbling up to painfully, crystal-clarity:<br>
<br>
The lesser one, that she wished she’d been in Scott’s arms, rather than Jean... and the second - which was more alarming - that she’d also wished she’d been in Jean’s arms, rather than Scott.<br>
<br>
Shaking her head, Rogue looked around, seeking something to help distract her from these mad thoughts. Unconsciously, she clenched her fingers, which still held the cup of doctored punch. Feeling the plastic cup crinkle under her gloved hand, Rogue glanced down at the pink-colored concoction...<br>
<br>
“Oh brother, what am I thinking?” she muttered, not sure which was the lesser of two evils at this point. However, the pang inside didn’t seem all that palpable at this point, in comparison to what this stuff would do to her.<br>
<br>
Grimacing, she nevertheless raised the cup to her lips and sipped a mouthful, swallowing it almost timidly. The cloying-sweet flavor of pineapple and strawberry almost masked the quick, alcohol burn as the liquid slid down her throat. Shivering in reflex, Rogue half-expected to bring the punch back up as quickly as she forced it down...<br>
<br>
Ten seconds later, the punch blossomed a ball of warmth inside her belly, which spread out through her limbs in a rather surprising, yet pleasing rush. Unaware, she’d licked her lips. “Hmmmmm,” she mumbled, looking into the cup with a quizzical expression. Finally, she admitted, “This stuff’s... not bad.” Taking another swallow, she tolerated the burn much more easily this time.<br>
<br>
“Wow,” she half-grinned, seeing she’d actually drank about two-thirds of the cup in two gulps. The warmth seemed to smother the earlier pangs and feelings, making her giggle softly out of reflex. “Mmm, wonder if there’s more of this left?” Determined to find out, Rogue started back down the hall towards the sounds of the on-going party...<br>
<br>

~ Xavier’s Institute for Gifted Children, The Mansion House, [location], Hours Later... ~<br>
<br>
<br>
Sitting on the main staircase, Rahne Sinclair yawned softly, her jaw popping slightly as she fought to stay awake. Dressed in her short-set pajamas, the high-school student had the air of someone's kid sister, waiting on the stairs for her older siblings to arrive. Leaning her head against the banister, she groaned, feeling stiff from sitting for all of the three hours she’d been at her lone vigil.<br>
<br>
“Rahne?”<br>
<br>
Jerking upright, Rahne turned towards the speaker, her eyes widening slightly in surprise. “Oh... Professor Xavier!”<br>
<br>
Rolling around the side of the staircase, the bald-headed headmaster of the Institute smiled disarmingly at her. “I’m sorry if I startled you, Rahne... with all of the others in bed by now, I didn’t expect anyone else up at this hour,” he stated.<br>
<br>
“Sorry, Professor. I didn’t feel like sleepin’,” Rahne admitted. <br>
<br>
“Ah, are you having a little trouble falling asleep?” Xavier asked.<br>
<br>
Nodding, Rahne ran a hand through her short red hair. “Somewhat... Scott an’ th’ others all went out somewhere, an’... well, I usually feel better when they’re all home.” She ducked her head slightly, “Also, I must be a bit wound up, since th’ exams at school have been a real grind, Sir.”<br>
<br>
“Well, with them being over, you should have some of the stress removed,” Xavier said with a small smile. “Though, I should remind you, while it’s not a school night, I expact all my students to get their rest.”<br>
<br>
“I know, Sir,” Rahne sighed. “I’m... I’ll be of t’bed soon. I promise.”<br>
<br>
Xavier nodded. “Good. I hope you’ll sleep well, Rahne.” With that, Xavier aimed his powered wheelchair towards the lower level access doorway, and rolled towards it. “I’ll be joining everyone shortly, after I make sure the security systems won’t go off when Scott and the others get back from Duncan’s.” He looked one last time at Rahne and smiled. “Good night.”<br>
<br>
“G’night, Professor,” she returned, smiling shyly. When he was out of sight, she closed her eyes and sighed in relief. “Mercy! I don’t mean t’sound rude... I just thought he’d never leave!” Shaking her head, she turned back towards the entrance. It was one thing when it was clear Xavier was clearly looking after her best interests... she didn’t want to seem ungrateful for that.<br>
<br>
But, if the Professor had managed to fathom the thoughts that were going through her mind... Rahne shuddered, imagining how he’d have reacted.<br>
<br>
“It’s not my fault tho,” she whispered to herself. “I cannot help... who can ever help who they’re attracted to? I mean, I don’t know how she feels, but...” Her words trailed off in a sigh, as she rested her cheek on one drawn-up knee.<br>
<br>
“I can still remember when she first came here,” Rahne mused. “Th’ Professor said that she’d been forced t’think of us X-Men as her mortal enemies... but, thanks t’Scott an’ th’ others, she’s become one o’ th’ best of us.” She smiled softly, recalling when Rogue had been first introduced to all of the younger classmen in Xavier’s school. “She looked so... mysterious! Her powers kept her at a distance, at first... but, she’s slowly become a good friend t’us all.” Rahne’s cheeks colored slightly as she added, “And... she’s become something more...”<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the sound of the front doors opening broke her train of thought. Jerking upright, Rahne stared at the foyer’s domed entrance, a small gasp escaping her lips as she recognized the teetering figure silohueted in the light streaming from the porchlight outside: “Rogue?”<br>
<br>
The door banged softly, as the southern-bred mutant leaned on one arm, her head hanging down over her chest as she muttered hoarsely, “mmm-lo? Perfessor? Ah...I can... explain?”<br>
<br>
Rahne bolted to her feet, moving towards Rogue as the taller female swung around the door jamb, barely hanging on by the tips of her fingers as she wobbled on unsteadly legs. “Rogue! What is wrong wi’ ye?” she hissed, not wanting to shout, so as to alert anyone to come investigate. She barely caught Rogue about the waist, keeping her from collapsing altogether. “Oof!” she grunted, feeling her arms strain against Rogue’s dead weight.<br>
<br>
“Wha... whoze there?” Rogue mumbled, her head indexing side to side slowly, before she let her sight fall on the red-haired teen beside her. “Hey... itza puppygirl!”<br>
<br>
Rahne wrinkled her nose, catching a whiff of Rogue’s breath. “Ew! Ye smell like an auld wine bottle... only mair fruity!”<br>
<br>
“’Cause I’ve... been drinkin’... party, punch, m’girl,” Rogue slurred, a small, sad grin slipping over her face. “Not that th’party was... much of a much... t’get happy o’er,” she added, ending her words with a small hiccup.<br>
<br>
Rahne frowned, then looked away in alarm, to where the door that Xavier had vanished through just moments ago. “Oh no,” she gasped. “If the Professor catches ye like this...” She set her jaw in a firm line. “Rogue, listen t’me! Rogue?” Rogue had started to hum a wordless tune, starting softly yet growing louder as she tottered heavily against Rahne’s grip. “Rogue, listen t’me... we’ve got t’get ye up to yer room before Professor Xavier-!”<br>
<br>
“Xavier!” Rogue jerked upright, scowling as she let her eyes sweep the length of the foyer. “He promised... promised me,” she grumbled, her face a dark, drunken mask as she tried to push Rahne away. “He’d help me... help me... XAVIER!”<br>
<br>
With a squeak of fear, Rahne reached up and snagged Rogue’s arm, pulling her off kilter as she forced her to stumble away from the entrance. “Rogue! Quiet!” She staggered under the burden of the taller female’s body, ushering her towards the stairway. “Please, we need t’get you t’bed! Don’t let th’ Professor know yer like this...” She gasped as they reached the foot of the stairs, eying the length of the height they would have to climb.<br>
<br>
With a drunken hiccup, Rogue let her head sag back against one shoulder. “Aww... gotta think... gotta see... th’ Perfessor,” she growled softly.<br>
<br>
“In th’ mornin’,” Rahne hissed, levering herself so she could place one foot on the bottom step. “Right now, ye need t’ get yer head straight. An’ f’r that, ye need rest,” she reasoned.<br>
<br>
# # #<br>
<br>
After the several agonizing minutes it took to get Rogue up the stairs - fearing each moment that they’d be discovered by Xavier, Logan or one of the others - Rahne dragged her uncooperative body along the upper hallway, down to her room. After a short fumble with the doorknob, the tiny redhead slipped inside and pulled Rogue in after her.<br>
<br>
“Wh-wha... whaz, goin’ on?” Rogue asked, when Rahne leaned her against the wall next to the door, so she could push it closed.<br>
<br>
“Shhh!” Rahne hissed softly. “Yer home... in yer room,” she explained.<br>
<br>
“Oh,” she replied. As inebriated as she was, Rogue couldn’t keep her head upright as she pressed herself against the wall. “I... don’ feel... s’good.”<br>
<br>
“Let’s get ye laid down,” Rahne said, as she locked the door, hoping that no one would come to investigate until daybreak. “Perhaps ye’ll feel better then?”<br>
<br>
“S’hope so,” Rogue grunted, leaning over Rahne’s shoulder when the short redhead pulled her back onto her feet. With her head bobbling while Rahne shuffled across the room to her bed, Rogue let a sour burp slip through her lips. “Stop... whose, spinnin’... th’ room?” she mumbled, closing her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Hold, on,” Rahne said, trying to keep the drunk girl from crashing to the floor. She finally got close enough to let Rogue slip onto the bed, helping ease her onto the down comforter gently. “Whew! There we go,” she sighed, letting go of Rogue’s waist.<br>
<br>
“ooh, geez... what’s... wrong wi’ mah head?” Rogue asked softly, putting the heel of one hand to her forhead.<br>
<br>
Rahne looked at her teammate with concern. “Ye’ve... ye look drunk, Rogue,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Nah... I feel drunk...” Rogue tipped her head back, closing her eyes against the swimming sensation that made her vision blur. “Oh, next time I go tah one of Duncan’s parties... I’m layin’ off the punch!”<br>
<br>
Rahne crawled up onto the bed next to Rogue, her brow pinched with worry. “Rogue, what made ye possesed t’even drink anythin’ so doctored up wi’ liquor? Th’ Professor told us all ‘bout th’ evils of alcohol last s’mester.”<br>
<br>
Rogue muttered something unintelligable, keeping her face turned away from her.<br>
<br>
Rahne strained to listen. <br>
<br>
# # #<br>
<br>
[Rahne and Rogue have sex together.]<br>
<br>
# # #<br>
<br>
The next thought that flitted through Rogue's waking mind was the sensation of warmth... body warmth! There was someone in her bed, next to her!<br>
<br>
&quot;Wu-ah?&quot; she mumbled, rubbing her face against the cotton pillowcase before lifting up to look down at herself. Draped across her body was a small, slim arm, the hand curled gently over her belly. She blinked twice, craning her neck to look behind herself...<br>
<br>
Into the sleeping face of a tiny, red-haired girl... a rather naked, and familiar, red-haired girl! Rahne!<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohmy...&quot; Rogue whispered, more to herself than for anyone else's benifit. Looking back down at herself, she shifted her legs, and gasped at the wet sensations she felt at her crotch. They hadn't just been sleeping naked... they'd been... the thought hit her like a fist. <br>
<br>
She'd had sex!<br>
<br>
&quot;OhmyGod!&quot; She started to pull away, realizing her own state of undress, but the arm around her tugged her back under the sheets. At the same time, the sleeping girl nuzzled her face against her shoulder, humming in a deep, contented tone as her body fitted like a complimenting puzzle piece against a taut belly and slim thighs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, geez,&quot; Rogue thought to herself. &quot;This... is NOT happening! How in... why is... how did we get like this?&quot; Looking away, she let her gaze drop to the floor of her bedroom... spying the crumpled remains of her party clothes and Rahne’s pajamas, scattered haphazzardly in a trail from the door to her bedside. The memories of the previous night came bubbling back through her foggy mind... the party, the music, as well as someone spiking the punch.<br>
<br>
She had only managed to make it back inside the Mansion without running into any of the instructors or the Professor, because... because... SHE had been waiting for her. As punchy as Rogue had been, she remembered enough of her being helped up the back stairs, past the other students - all asleep in their beds - up to her room. There had been a brief discussion, over what she couldn't say, but after that... after that...<br>
<br>
Her thoughts were interupted by another sleepy sigh at her back. Rahne’s arm tightened around her slightly, pressing her back against her bedmate snuggly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Geez! How is this even possible?&quot; Rogue asked herself. Her powers isolated her from any intimate, skin-on-skin contact... now that she was more awake, the one thought struck her hard. They'd touched last night, and she hadn't absorbed her memories, or her powers! &quot;Ohmy... how is the Prof gonna explain this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;'splain what?&quot;<br>
<br>
She nearly jumped out of her skin at that whispered remark. Snapping her head around, she looked once more at the face belonging to her unlikely bedmate. Only now, Rahne’s eyes were half-open, staring muzzily into her own.<br>
<br>
&quot;'lo...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um,&quot; Rogue replied with a flush of blush on her cheeks. &quot;Hi...&quot;<br>
<br>
With a soft smile, Rahne yawned softly. &quot;What's wrong? Ye seem... upset.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue struggled to find her voice. &quot;I,,, I'm not. Really!&quot; She dropped her eyes down to their naked bodies briefly. &quot;It... It's just, well... I can't explain how you, well...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How we're both like this,&quot; her parnter said softly, letting her hand rub over Rogue's belly in a drifting caress. &quot;Is that it, luv?&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue could only nod, the contact of her skin against the touch of her fingers stirring an electric pulse that shook her to the core.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can only tell ye this much... ye were three-sheets tae th' wind last night. Ye started babblin' somethin' about Scott an' Jean, an' then, well...&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue blushed again at that memory: seeing Scott and Jean necking in that dark corner at Duncan’s... <br>
<br>
Rahne seemed to know what Rogue was thinking. &quot;Ye crave tae have that touch, that feeling... tae be so luved, it dinnae matter whoes touch it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue shifted to stare at her, turning so she lay flat on her back. &quot;How do you-?&quot; She paused, as her companion snuggled closer into her side. &quot;How are you even able to do this? My powers-!&quot;<br>
<br>
Rahne let one hand drift up from her waist, tracing one finger between Rogue's breasts. &quot;I canna say why, f'r certain. Tho... I did discover it during one o' our trainin' sessions.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue blinked. &quot;When was this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A few weeks ago,&quot; her bedmate admitted shyly. &quot;Ye were supposed t'be getting Storm's powers, an' ye forgot tae replace yer glove. Everyone was tryin' tae get aboard th' Blackbird, an'... ye pulled me aboard.&quot; Two eyes twinkled with warmth as her hand cupped over Rogue's right breast. &quot;We'd been movin' so fast, it dinnae register tae me, until later.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue tried to ignore the tingling feelings that touch was generating, as she absorbed the words spoken to her. &quot;So... somehow, your immune to my power?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So it would seem, luv.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But... why hasn't the Professor clued in on this?&quot; Rogue's brow knitted with a frown. &quot;I thought he'd know if something like this was possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I dinnae know,&quot; her bedmate shrugged. &quot;But, f'r what it's worth, I'm glad I'm th' one that has this immunity.&quot; Rahne leaned closer, gazing with smoky eyes into Rogue's surprised face. &quot;I've been waitin' since f'rever tae be like this, wi' you.&quot;<br>
<br>
That revelation shocked Rogue - surprisingly, in a pleasurable way - as she stared back at her. &quot;You... have?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye... ever since ye first came tae th' Institute.&quot; Now her bedmate ducked her head as her cheeks colored slightly. &quot;I've been havin'... feelin's, whenever ye've been around.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue had to smile a little at that. &quot;Funny... it's always the shy one's,&quot; she mused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye's not mad at me, are ye?&quot; Rahne looked back up at her with wide eyes. &quot;I dinnae mean tae take such advantage of ye... but, when ye started talkin' about Jean an' Scott... an' ye sounded so, so loney...&quot;<br>
<br>
Surprising herself, Rogue reached up and placed a finger across her lips. &quot;Hey, I... I understand.&quot; She looked sideways, smiling softly at the emotions that were coming to the fore at this time. &quot;I mean... I didn't expect this, at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But, that doesn't mean... I'm not, well, opposed to this now,&quot; Rogue admitted sheepishly. &quot;I mean, I did admit I'd have been happy to have either Scoot, or Jean, last night.&quot;<br>
<br>
At that, Rahne beamed. &quot;But, ye've got me tho...&quot; She gave Rogue's nipple - which had been growing stone hard with every touch - a firm tweak. &quot;Right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Wincing, yet laughing softly, Rogue reached out and jabbed her fingers into her bedmate's ribs, tickling her in return. &quot;Hey!&quot; she chuckled as they suddenly were embroiled in a mutal tickle-fight; bundling up the sheets as they rolled over and over each other, jockeying for position.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Rogue ended up back on her backside, panting and waving her hands in surrender as a grinning Rahne straddled her hips, sitting over her with both hands poised to deliver more tickles. &quot;All right, all right, I give! I give!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a triumphant smile, the tiny redhead lowered herself on top of Rogue, throwing her arms around her shoulders in a warm embrace. &quot;Guid... I've been waitin' tae long t'have ye in my arms, Rogue.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I... I'm happy, I guess,&quot; Rogue admitted. &quot;I'm, not used to being this way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, I understand, luv... If ye'd rather not have me be this way...&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue shook her head. &quot;I didn't say that! I guess... I just need to get used to this,&quot; she said, giving a soft smile. &quot;Though, I don't know how the others are gonna deal with... well, this!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who says they have tae? I was sorta hopin' tae keep this between us,&quot; Rahne said, running one hand along Rogue's cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hm, that... might not be a bad idea,&quot; Rogue mused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Does that mean ye's not gonna tell th' Prof about... us?&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue weighed the options silently for a moment or two. &quot;If I told the Professor,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;we'd both be pulled apart, while he and Hank try to figure out how we can touch like this. It might even unlock the key to my powers.&quot; She saw the sudden, crestfallen look on Rahne’s face. &quot;But... I think, having someone I can be close to would be something better,&quot; she grinned.<br>
<br>
At that, Rahne gasped, then swooped into place a kiss on Rogue's lips. Recovering from its suddenness, Rogue returned the liplock with a slow, smoldering passion, wrapping her arms around her naked body.<br>
<br>
Breaking off, Rogue sighed deeply. &quot;I take it... you like that idea?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, oh aye, I do!&quot; The tiny woman tucked her head under Rogue's chin, hugging her as close as their bodies would allow. &quot;Oh, Rogue... you have made me so happy, luv!&quot;<br>
<br>
Rogue felt moisture gather at the corners of her eyes, as she dipped her face to place a loving kiss on her red-tressed head. &quot;I'm glad, Rahne... so, very glad.&quot;<br>
<br>
