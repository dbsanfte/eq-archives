All three elements converged upon me today; this short little fic was a nice way to while away a very rainy evening.  I could, I suppose, go on from here and make the thing XXX (I will if the mood strikes me), but I think it works as it stands.  <br>
<br>
Oh, there are a bunch of italics that I couldn't make ezbaord do, so if you see something that looks like it belongs in italics...well, it probably should be.<br>
<br>
like it?  Hate it?<br>
<br>
enjoy<br>
Jackel<br>
<br>
Warm Rains...<br>
   <br>
<br>
     Pretty out here.<br>
<br>
    Oh, who ya kidding, Rogue?  Pretty lonely out here.<br>
<br>
     Long legs swung in open air, and she didn’t mind, never mind the drop because that couldn’t hurt her, oh no.  The crazy things like dropping down a steep ravine into a raging river should never give her pause; she could fly, after all, and even without that particular stolen ability, she’d survive.  Yeah, she thought bitterly, survive, always survive.<br>
<br>
    It’s the little things, the little ordinary things, I can’t manage.<br>
<br>
    Rogue, ya mopin’ again.  Doesn't suit you.<br>
<br>
    The young woman perched upon the log that stretched, along with the messy tangle of undergrowth which had accompanied the great tree on its fall,  across the steep mountain gorge, swung her long legs casually over the sheer drop below.  It was a warm afternoon, almost uncomfortably warm, but in the shadow of the granite cliff that rose above her, the thin cotton tank top she wore wasn’t quite enough.  This high in the mountains, the weather was chancy and odd.<br>
<br>
     Mission completed, as usual, bad guys defeated, world saved, again as usual.  Rogue breathed a tired sigh, flicked the pale streaks that threaded her chestnut hair out of intent green eyes, and stretched the kinks from her supple back.  All that was wanted now, was to round up Storm and head for home.  Or, rather, vise-versa, sense Storm was technically in command.  Not that it mattered.<br>
<br>
     Where was Ororo, anyhow?  Not that that mattered, either.  Rogue was in no particular hurry to go home.  Yeah, she missed Gambit, but seeing him was so bittersweet it was almost a relief to be away from him.  Maybe being out in these God-knows-where mountains was what she needed.  Irritated, the mutant shook her head.  Ya’ll’re bein’ maudlin, Rogue, it don’t suit ya.<br>
<br>
     “Time an’ again, Ah hate my power,” she growled to herself, her voice a soft drawl.  The emptiness below gave her no answer, certainly no sympathy.  Rogue shook her head, exasperated with herself.<br>
<br>
    Thunder pealed above her.  The mutant glanced upward, startled, just in time for the raindrops to hit her surprised face.  What, the...rain?  Now?  <br>
<br>
      Oh, right.  Rogue glared into the suspicious clouds.  “Storm?”<br>
<br>
      And there she was, on cue, stepping from the empty air as if coalescing from the mist she herself had wrought, the splendid pallor of her hair streaming behind her as though still a part of that mist.  An almost mischievous smile touched her haughty mouth.<br>
<br>
     Rogue had to sigh a little with the beauty of it, even as she made herself glare at the older woman.  The soul of elegance, of easy, unconscious grace, and a lithe, fearsome power.  Elemental, almost.  What almost, Rogue thought to herself disgustedly, that’s the whole point, isn’t it?<br>
<br>
     “What’s with the rain, Sugah?”  she challenged with a flippant lilt.<br>
<br>
    Storm touched down on the mossy deadfall, light as you please, and settled easily beside her teammate.  Something, Rogue noticed with a certain irony, quite possibly a personal electrical halo, was keeping the rain from that soft, flowing mane, the perfect coffee of her skin.  Rogue was already soaked enough that her shirt, what there was of it, was starting to stick.  <br>
<br>
     “You looked like you needed company.”  A tiny shift in Ororo’s dry voice made it a question.<br>
<br>
    Rogue shrugged, a little uneasily.  “Woulda asked for it.”  She paused.  “’Sides, what does that have to do with,” she gestured at the clouds above and raised an ironic brow.<br>
<br>
    “You’re brooding,”  noted Storm, and it was not a question. “Why, Rogue?  You did very well.”<br>
<br>
   “Yeah, yeah, another day, another mission.  What, you tryin’ to make the weather match my mood or something?” <br>
<br>
    A tiny smile graced Storm’s lips, and the rain stopped, and something in Rogue’s chest tightened.  Her friend’s strange eyes were full of compassion, affection, a little concern.  Damn, but she was pretty.  Rogue shook her head.  Pretty like this mountain, pretty like the river, like the sky itself.  Pretty wasn’t the word.  Not by half.<br>
    <br>
    “The usual reason?”<br>
<br>
    The two women stared at each other for a long moment, Storm endlessly patent, endlessly compassionate, while challenge and annoyance and things more complex chased one another through Rogue’s eyes before she finally had to look away.<br>
<br>
     “Yeah,” the younger Southerner sighed at last, “the usual reason.  Leave it, ‘roro.  Not gonna do any good to talk about it.”<br>
<br>
     She was staring down the gorge, and so she did not see the pain flicker in the other’s eyes, did not see Storm lift her long hands, did not know until she felt the touch, feather-light upon her damp shoulder.  Panic caused her to lurch back, and only exquisitely trained reflexes kept her stable on her perch as she jerked her head around.<br>
<br>
     What was it, what did she see in the beautiful strange eyes of her friend, still milky-hazed with the aura of her power?<br>
<br>
    “Damn it, Storm,” she hissed, and cursed her traitor heart for its leaping, her skin which was alert and needful like its own live thing.  A pause, the angry leaping of the river below.  “Ah’ll hurt you.”<br>
<br>
    Ororo shrugged, all liquid ease, unreadable calm.  Something more.  The rain began again, big, wet, warm drops that were almost soothing, almost comforting, like the caress Rogue could never receive.  The electrical haze she had kindled kept Storm’s head mostly dry, but the water sluiced down the long perfection of her throat, her hands.<br>
<br>
     Her smile was quiet, utterly sure of herself, and there was an edge in that quiet glare that made something clench in Rogue, made her want to run from the things she really wanted to do.<br>
<br>
    “I don’t think so,” Storm said quietly, so utterly calm.  “I think I’m better than that, that I can take this challenge.”<br>
<br>
   Ororo touched her shoulder again, let the edge of her nail and that maddening light shiver of her fingertip make a path across the clean lines of Rogue’s collarbone, her throat, skin slicked with the water, the rain.  Both of their skins now, soaked, and the gentle rain fell on and on.  Rogue felt the warning of her power, felt it reach for Storm, but the water, that molecule’s width of moisture held it so slimly, so very slimly at bay.<br>
<br>
    “’Roro,” she swallowed through gritted teeth, “Stop it.  Whatever you’re doing.”<br>
<br>
    Storm quirked an ironic brow at her teammate.  Rogue blushed through the warm torrent.  <br>
<br>
   “Ya can’t,” she tried again, almost desperate now.  “It’s too dangerous, you know that.  I...appreciate it.”  She shivered and looked away, though the rain was not cold.  “Ah can’t say how I appreciate it.  Ah can’t risk...risk hurtin’ you.”<br>
<br>
    Storm’s downpour increased, beat insistent upon them both, filled the air with the scent of moss and ozone and evergreen boughs, tangy and sweet.  Sweet as that one beside her, sweet and fatal and...leave, Ororo, she begged but didn’t voice, leave me, don’t do this...<br>
<br>
     The fingertips, soft and strong, so confident, so powerful, divided from her killing touch by the merest breadth of moisture, and Rogue could not move, could not bear to pull away from that terrible gentleness.  She trembled under her friend’s careful touch...too careful, Storm, but you can’t be careful enough, you can’t, don’t you know that?<br>
<br>
   Rogue wanted to be angry.<br>
<br>
   She could not look at her friend, did not want the other to see the raw need she knew filled her eyes.  Did not move until she felt the sharp point of the other’s nail beneath her throat demanded it, so tenderly cupping her chin as the deluge made warm runnels around long, dark fingers.<br>
<br>
     The rain came so hard now that it stung her eyelids.  Rogue looked up, gaze shining, troubled.  When had Storm come so close?  She hadn’t noticed.<br>
<br>
     “Trust me,” Ororo murmurred, and her voice was low, so sure, so full of a quiet desire as sharp and full as Rogue’s own.  Rogue’s limbs would not obey her, and her power curled in her like a serpent, the deadly thing that it was, but Storm was not touching her, not really.<br>
<br>
    Storm’s hands on the side of her face, the skin of water between them, but barely, not a real thing, and Rogue felt herself falling, down, forever and ever into the gorge and beyond, but still she was here with the moss beneath her and the water soaking her utterly, and Storm’s warm, sure hands holding her, cupping her face.  She closed her eyes, and there was nothing but that beautiful warmth, steely softness, the elemental majesty of the other as their lips touched, her Ororo soft and demanding, as quenching and needful as water upon a mouth parched with thirst, and the rain poured endless down, and down, and down.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#dddddd>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfemx>Fem-X</a><font color=#dddddd> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffemxfrm8>Fanfiction Workshop</a> <font color=#dddddd> - </font><a href="http://www.fem-x.net">Fem-X</a><font color=#dddddd> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
