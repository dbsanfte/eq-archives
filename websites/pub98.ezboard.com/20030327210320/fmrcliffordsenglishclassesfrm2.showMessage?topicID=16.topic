Tom and Huck had fun adventures at the beginning of the novel but as Huck traveled without Tom his adventures became more dangerous and life threatening.  When Huck joins Tom his perspective on life becomes surreal and playful.  Tom brings out the immaturity in Huck and allows him to think of life as an adventure.  The end of the book portrais Huck going back to his immature self as he follows Tom in their adventure to save Jim's life.  Jim also profoundly effects Huck. At the beginning of the novel Huck has some racist ideas ingraved in him by his society yet as he travels with Jim he manages to alter his views.  In the beginning Huck goes along with societies racist view but as he gets to know Jim he sarts making up his own mind about his feeling toward slaves and relies more on his own intelligence.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=muellerd3@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>MuellerD3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/12/03 11:55:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Danny's Response</span><hr size=1>      I believe that the two most influential characters to Huck are Tom and Pap. Tom would be the most influential person to Huck because throughout his entire ordeal Huck thinks about what Tom would do or say about Huck's adventures. Tom taught Huck about having adventures and how they work. it seems that Huck respects Tom more than anyone else. Huck respects Tom because Tom has read a lot and knows about the way things work. Huck and the other boys trust Tom because they figure he knows what he is talking about.<br>
     On the other side of being influenced by people, Huck constantly thinks about Pap as well. Huck probably respects Pap less than anyone else. Pap's influence on Huck is not as great as Tom's because it only comes up in instances. The scene where Huck doesn't find the rider at the circus funny because he is pretending to be drunk. Pap's influence on Huck prevents him from enjoying a potentially fun situation. Tom's influence on Huck is all in fun and harmless and is simply part of childhood. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thomsonb3h@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>thomsonb3h</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/12/03 6:57:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  brent's posting</span><hr size=1> I believe that the two most influencial characters on Huck are Pap and Jim. Pap is the most influencial on Huck in the way that he was mean and mistreated Huck. Because Pap mistreated Huck in the scene at the log cabin he forced Huck to run away. After Huck ran away he started a completely different life. If Pap had been good to him who knows where Huck would be right now and who knows how he would have developed. Jim is the second most influencial because he comes into the picture after Pap caused Huck to leave. Jim has many influences on Huck all of which may have been nonexisting or less influencial without the influence pap had on Huck causing him to leave and live the live he is living. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=timms3@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>Timms3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/12/03 9:31:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Stephanie's posting</span><hr size=1> I think that Huck was influenced by mostly Jim and Tom. I feel that Jim influenced Huck because he was the person that made Huck realize that black people are human beings just like white people are. This realization dramatically affects Huck’s outlook on many things. Huck is no longer believes what society has taught him to believe and he is able to think for himself. Jim brings these things out of Huck by showing different emotions such as fear when Huck is lost, anger when Huck tricks him, and longing  when he describes his family. Even though Jim obviously impacted Huck greatly, I think that Tom had an even greater impact. Although Huck learned a lot from Jim most of this knowledge seemed to disappear when Tom showed up. Huck was no longer thinking for himself and living independently. He was just listening to Tom and doing what Tom wanted him to do, no matter how ridiculous it was. This was a major step back for Huck, which is why I believe the person who caused this, Tom, is the person who influenced Huck the most. <br>

Jim is the most  influential because he is the main reason Huck is on his adventure.If Jim was not in the book Huck would not have had to run back to the island and tell Jim that slave hunters were coming with dogs, because there would not be any slave huunters coming for him. Further along in the book, Huck was forced to keep on going south in order to prove to Duke and King that Jim was not a runaway slave.Jim also was the reason that Huck ended up with the Phelps's. If Jim had not been turned into the Mr. Phelps, Huck would not have gone to find him and he would not have been reunited with Tom.       <br>
   Tom is the second-most influential character in the novel because does not directly influence Huck's actions like Jim does. Although, he does influence Huck throughout the novel.For instance, the whole time Huck was faking his own death he was thinking what would Tom Sawyer do. In many other of Huck's schemes he also think's about what Tom would do to add more style. Tom influences Huck again when they are going to free Jim by telling Huck how to make a prison escape by the book and he backs it up by saying thast he has read the book so he knows how it is supposed to be done. Still Jim has the most influence on Huck.       <br>
    The scene that influenced Huck the most is when Huck apologizes to Jim for playing a cruel Joke on him. Huck refers back to this scene when he tries to &quot;pray a lie&quot;. He decides to help Jim because Jim said that Huck was his only friend. Therefore Jim influenced Huck the most, followed closely byTom.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battey4>Battey4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 12:29:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Influence</span><hr size=1>       In the second ahlf of this novel, there is much more evidence of where Huck comes from and how he is influenced. I believe that the two characters that influenced Huck the most are Tom and Jim in a close second. The main reason that I would say that Huck is influenced by Tom the most is because Huck refrences what Tom Sawyer would do more than anything. He always considers what Tom would do and how Tom would feel or act in a situation. A reason that it is a good thing that Tom is a influence of Huck is because Tom is a very bright and well read kid. He has a strong system of morals and values, and always keeps Huck in check. <br>
        The reason that a reader would say that Hucky is influenced by Jim would be because of the shift in attitude that Huck has from the begining of the book to the end of the book. In the begining of the book, Huck has absolutely no respect for Jim and believes that he is just a dumb black man, but as Jim and Huck spend more time together Huck realizes that there is more to Jim than just the color of his skin. Jim shows Huck a lot about other pepole and a lot about himself.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=urgoa3@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>urgoa3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 1:42:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  ashley's responce</span><hr size=1> I believe that the two people that influenced Huck the most were Tom and Jim. Tom influenced Huck by showing him how important it was to be looked up at. Huck has always looked up to Tom because of his education strong will and knowledge. Huck is taking after him and wants to be a strong willed person and I think he got it from Tom. The second person that influenced Huck was Jim. Huck comes to love Jim and comes to learn about black people. Jim is Huck's friend and shows him that it is ok not to be racist. Huck grows so much throughout the book because he learns that it is ok to like blacks and to help them.<br>
I think that the most influential part of the book for Huck was when Jim was sold and Huck realized how much he really cared about him and that he wanted to help him. The part of the book when he writes the letter and then rips it up was the most crucial turning point of the book because it is revealed that Huck is not racist.<br>

Pap plays a huge part in Huck's life because he taught Huck how to cope. Huck learned at an early age how to live by himself, get alone in the wild, and to manipulate people. When the King and Duke come aboard, Huck lets them take over his raft, because he says that they are like Pap. He knows from past experiences that the best thing to do with men like that is just to leave them alone. If Huck had called them in their lies from the second they met, he would never have had all of the experiences with them that he did. Also, Pap made Huck want to get an education, and make something more out of his life. Just seeing how ignorant Pap was, and knowing that Pap didn't want him to make anything of himself was enough for Huck to go to school. Without Pap's influence, Huck wouldn't have had many of the experiences, bad and good, that form his character. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=willsont@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>WillsonT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 9:28:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Reply to #2</span><hr size=1>      The two most influential people to Huck's Character are Jim and Tom.  Eventhough Tom Sawyer is no present in most of the novel, he has been a big influence on the way Huck id today.  He has gotten Huck to love adventures and the wilderness and has been a very good friend to Huck over the years.  Jim however is also a very important person becasue he changes Huck's outlook.  When Huck first meets Jim, becasue he is in need of companionship, he overlooks Jim's race which at the time Huck would normally have a problem with. As the trip goes on, he starts to question he motives and wonders if helping Jim is really a good idea.  Over time Jim's friendship with Huck makes Huck see people for who they really are and not just by the color of their skin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morant3@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>MoranT3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 9:32:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Reply to Brent</span><hr size=1>    I agree with Brent that the two most influential characters are Pap and Jim. But I think that Jim plays more of a role in Huck's life than Pap does. Jim completely changes how Huck views the black race. Also, Huck would never have been able to have all of the Adventures he had if he didn't have Jim's company. He was lonely after only a few days on the island. Jim's presence made this novel possible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=campbellc4@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>CampbellC4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 9:32:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Chelsea's Response</span><hr size=1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The two people that influence Huck the greatest are Tom and Jim. Tom is the leader of the pack, he is the most educated of all the boys and every one follows him .Huck listens to what Tom says, and even though he does not agree with what he is saying, he goes a long with it. Of the two, the most influential is Jim.. After Huck’s experiences with Jim, Huck becomes more conscious of how he should treat Jim. Being with Jim and seeing that Jim has feelings and great characteristics Huck realizes that black people are no different from white people. For example, when Huck messes with Jim’s head, Jim is really hurt. Jim had been scared that Huck was in trouble and he was going to risk his life to help him. Huck gradually begins to realize that his tricks aren’t funny and that Jim is a human being. Through Huck’s experiences with Jim he becomes a better person and also begin’s to have more of an independent mind.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The most influential scene is when Huck apologizes to Jim for playing a joke on him. Before being with Jim, Huck had never thought of Jim or any other black man as some one who should be treated with respect or that had feelings.  It showed the transition of racist/sheltered Huck to aware/emotional Huck.<br>

Huck no longer sees people by the clor of their skin, and has embraced Jim as a very close friend who he is willing to help become free.

I think Jim definitely influences Huck the most and Tom is second.  I think that Tom helps Huck a lot in the book.  When Tom told Huck that he would help him free Jim it was very shocking for Huck.  I think that it helped him to realize that sometimes what's thought of as good and bad in society isn't always right.  It also at least let him know that there was one person on his side on the issue.  I think that Tom also helped Huck to loosen up and have more fun.  When they were getting ready to free Jim what Tom had them do was pointless but I think it took Huck's mind off of whether freeing Jim was right or wrong.  I think that Jim taught Huck to trust his instincts and to worry so much about whether every little thing that he does is okay by society. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heiskelle3>HeiskellE3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 10:01:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Who influences Huck the most?</span><hr size=1> I think that the scene that affected Huck the most was when Jim told Huck that he was his best and only friend.  This affected Huck so much that even after he decided to turn Jim in he lied to keep him from being caught.  When the  men wanted to come on the raft to check and see if Huck was hiding a slave was a perfect time to turn Jim in but what Jim said to him he couldn't bring himself to do it.  Later in the book he thinks about how Jim said that he was his only friend and it affects decisions that he makes.  That scene is when he finally decides that he really wants Jim to be free and shows that he and Jim have become loyal friends. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=winston1@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>winston1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 10:47:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Huck's influences</span><hr size=1> Bill Churchill<br>

Influential Characters<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I believe that the two characters who influence Huck the most in the book are his father, Pap, and the two con men, the Duke and King, because talks very seriously of the changes that they have caused in him. Pap is an awful mean drunkard of a father to Huck and only comes home to him when it will profit him in some way. Pap drinks incessantly and is violent and highly irrational when intoxicated chasing Huck around inside their shanty saying he is going to kill Huck. Huck reflects Pap’s influence not only in his crude manner but also in Huck’s reaction to drunkenness at a circus he visits by showing great concern for a performer pretending to be drunk. The King and Duke also greatly influence Huck in that they turn Huck away from lying because they con people out of what is theirs with their very hurtful lies. I believe that Huck sees what he might become in the future with the King and the Duke and is repulsed by their awful and unscrupulous characters. In the book Huck states that he thinks what they do is horrible and really shows their significant influence upon him.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I believe that the most significant event which changes Huck is when Huck sees Buck mowed down in a hail of gunfire. This event in the book amounts to a loss of innocence in Huck which all children eventually go through. While Huck has weathered a very tough childhood without a mother and a drunkard father he has probably never seen anything like someone he knows and cares about getting brutally shot to death. When Huck drags Buck’s corpse on to shore and cover’s it over he sits and cries over Buck realizing he is gone forever. I think that this single event in the book influenced Huck the most in the book.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=winston1@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>winston1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 11:00:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Response to Chelsea</span><hr size=1> Churchill's response <br>
<br>
I agree with Chelsea in that Jim influenced Huck greatly throughout the novel because he really made Huck think that slaves were like white people (but not great enough to make him an abolitionist). Though Jim’s character is not very well developed or respected in the novel he still manages to influence Huck greatly.<br>
The point I disagree with Chelsea on is her argument that Tom is more influential than Pap or Duke and King in influencing Huck in the novel. While Tom does serve as an influence to widen Huck’s education Huck only thinks of him as a fun friend and not as someone who really influenced him.<br>
