<br>
***<br>
<br>
Some of mine:<br>
<br>
Turn Your eyes upon Jesus<br>
Look full in His wonderful face<br>
And the things of earth<br>
Will grow strangely dim<br>
In the light of His glory and grace<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
You are my hope and my refuge<br>
You are the rock that will not be moved<br>
Your mercies endure forever<br>
Your love is so perfect<br>
Your ways are so true<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
I stand to praise You, but I fall on my knees<br>
My spirit is willing, but my flesh is so weak<br>
So light the fire in my weary soul<br>
Fan the flame, make my spirit whole<br>
Lord You know just where I've been<br>
So light the fire in my heart again<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
I want to know You<br>
I want to hear Your voice<br>
I want to know You more<br>
I want to touch You<br>
I want to see Your face<br>
I want to know You more<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Strip away all that remains<br>
That You would shine and I would fade<br>
Till there's nothing left of me<br>
Till there's nothing left of me<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
And one I wish they'd sing in church but I've only heard on CD...<br>
<br>
In need of grace<br>
In need of love<br>
In need of mercy raining down<br>
From high above<br>
<br>
In need of strength<br>
In need of peace<br>
In need of things<br>
That only You can give to me<br>
<br>
In need of Christ<br>
The perfect Lamb<br>
My refuge strong<br>
The great I Am<br>
This is my song<br>
My humble plea<br>
I am Your child<br>
I am in need <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

Turn Your Eyes was actually added onto and done all contemporary by the Newsboys (how much do those guys rock!) and they added some gorgeous verses onto it.  It's a bit long, so I won't type it in, but check it out, it's really cool!<br>
<br>
Here's a couple of mine... just a couple of out like, dozens!<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
I'm forgiven,<br>
Because You were forsaken.<br>
I'm accepted,<br>
You were condemned.<br>
I'm alive and well;<br>
Your Spirit is within me,<br>
Because You died and rose again.<br>
<br>
Amazing love, how can it be<br>
That You, my king, would die for me?<br>
Amazing love, I know it's true,<br>
And it's my joy to honor You.<br>
In all I do, I honor You.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
What if what they say is true?<br>
What if You walked on water?<br>
What if You calmed the seas?<br>
Can You calm me?<br>
<br>
What if what they say is true?<br>
What if You fed five thousand?<br>
What if You healed disease?<br>
Can You heal me?<br>
<br>
I don't wanna believe it.<br>
I don't wanna receive it.<br>
Why would you do anything for me?<br>
<br>
What if what they say is true?<br>
What if You rose on Easter?<br>
What if You conquered death?<br>
Can You conquer me?<br>
<br>
Your life to conquer death.<br>
And I'm asked to walk my steps with You.<br>
Can it stop the pain that covers me?<br>
<br>
What if what they say is true?<br>
What if You came to love me?<br>
What if You heard me say....<br>
I love You, too...<br>
I love You, too...<br>
(fade)<br>

Well, they aren't church songs, exactly, my church hasn't adopted them, anyway, but I heard them at youth conferences and retreats, and I think a lot of more up-to-date churches use them.  I like the worship songs that are sung straight to God like a prayer.  My other favs are God of Wonders and Draw Me Close. *sigh* Gorgeousness...<br>

The story behind it reminds me of a some-what modern day Job story. You should find it and read it sometime. Anyway, here's the lyrics...<br>
<br>
It is well<br>
<br>
WHEN PEACE,<br>

CONTROL<br>
THAT CHRIST<br>
HAS REGARDED MY<br>
HELPLESS ESTATE<br>
AND HATH SHED<br>
HIS OWN BLOOD FOR<br>
MY SOUL<br>
<br>
IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL<br>
IT IS WELL IT IS WELL<br>

<br>
<br>

PEOPLE AND REALMS<br>
FROM EV'RY TONGUE<br>
DWELL ON HIS LOVE<br>
<br>
WITH SWEETEST<br>
SONG<br>
VOICES OF CHILDREN<br>
SHALL PROCLAIM<br>
THEIR EARLY BLESSINGS<br>
ON HIS NAME<br>
<br>
Also one by Martin Luther...<br>
<br>
1. A mighty fortress is our God, <br>
a bulwark never failing;<br>
our helper he amid the flood <br>
of mortal ills prevaling. <br>
For still our ancient foe<br>
doth seek to work us woe;<br>
his craft and power are great, <br>
and armed with cruel hate, <br>
on earth is not his equal.<br>
<br>
 <br>
2. Did we in our own strength confide, <br>
our striving would be losing, <br>
were not the right man on our side, <br>
the man of God's own choosing.<br>
Dost ask who that may be? <br>
Christ Jesus, it is he; <br>
Lord Sabbaoth, his name,<br>
from age to age the same,<br>
and he must win the battle.<br>
<br>
 <br>
3. And though this world, with devils filled, <br>
should threaten to undo us, <br>
we will not fear, for God hath willed <br>
his truth to triumph through us. <br>
The Prince of Darkness grim, <br>
we tremble not for him; <br>
his rage we can endure, <br>
for lo, his doom is sure; <br>
one little word shall fell him.<br>
<br>
 <br>
4. That word above all earthly powers, <br>
no thanks to them, abideth; <br>
the Spirit and the gifts are ours, <br>
thru him who with us sideth. <br>
Let goods and kindred go, <br>
this mortal life also; <br>
the body they may kill; <br>
God's truth abideth still; <br>
his kingdom is forever.<br>
 <br>

sing my tongue the glory<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Corporis mysterium,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

and the blood (precious)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Quem in mundi pretium</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
what/who in world ransomed<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fructus ventris generosi,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
springs forth as fruits of the womb (generous/gentle)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rex effudit gentium</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
(a King) poured forth from the nations<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Nobis datus, nobis natus</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Ex intacta Virgine</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
from the untouched virgin<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Et in mundo conversatus,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
and in the world dwelt<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sparso verbi semine,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
scatter (sow) the word as seed <br>
(there is a play on words here: conversatus/verbi recalling the opening passage of the gospel of Saint John)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sui moras incolatus</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
who in this time inhabits (earth)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Miro clausit ordine</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

undiluted (wine) now Christ's blood<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Et si sensus deficit,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
and if the senses fail<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ad firmandum cor sincerum</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
the sincere firm heart<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sola fides sufficit.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
finds faith sufficient (to believe)<br>
<br>
The last two lines are know as the Tantum Ergo, sung during Benediction:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tantum ergo Sacramentum</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Great therefore is the Sacrament<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Veneremur cernui:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Laus et iubilatio,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
praise and jubilation<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Salus, honor, virtus quoque</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
health, honour and also goodness (virtue)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sit et benedictio:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
and blessing<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Procedenti ab utroque</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
proceeds from both<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Compar sit laudatio.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
an equal praise to him (the Holy Spirit)<br>
<br>
<br>
There are numerous translations of the Pangue Lingua (Pange Lingus) and Tantum Ergo available. It is a favorite amongst Gregorian chant fans, and I think most beautiful in Latin.<br>
