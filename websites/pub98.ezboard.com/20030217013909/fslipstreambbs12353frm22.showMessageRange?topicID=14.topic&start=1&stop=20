<br>
Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost. To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction. For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, even while inspectors were in his country. Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons -- not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities. <br>
<br>
Almost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world. The 108 U.N. inspectors were sent to conduct -- were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California. The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy them as directed. Nothing like this has happened. <br>
<br>
The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax -- enough doses to kill several million people. He hasn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it. <br>
<br>
The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin -- enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure. He hadn't accounted for that material. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed it. <br>
<br>
Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He's not accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them. <br>
<br>
U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them -- despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them. <br>
<br>
From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents, and can be moved from place to a place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them. <br>
<br>
The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide. <br>
<br>
The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary; he is deceiving. From intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the U.N. inspectors, sanitizing inspection sites and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses. <br>
<br>
Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations. Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say. Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with U.N. inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families. <br>
<br>
Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But why? The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack. <br>
<br>
With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly havoc in that region. And this Congress and the America people must recognize another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of al Qaeda. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them develop their own. <br>
<br>
Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans -- this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes. (Applause.) <br>
<br>
Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent. Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike? If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option. (Applause.) <br>
<br>
The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages -- leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained -- by torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning. (Applause.) <br>
<br>
And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country -- your enemy is ruling your country. (Applause.) And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation. (Applause.) <br>
<br>
The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country, and our friends and our allies. The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi's legal -- Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors, and its links to terrorist groups. <br>
<br>
We will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.

The above statement provides no evidence at all.  For many years I have had the materials in my house to make all kinds of explosives, and a copy of the Anarchist's cookbook.  Yet, I haven't made any explosives.  Possessing ingredients doesn't mean one has to bake a cake.  The inspectors present <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>now</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have not found sufficient evidence to support military action.  I won't support war on the basis of supposition and hearsay, nor one supported by logically fallacious reasoning.  You can all stand up and cheer Bush's idiocy all you want, just don't expect any thinking, inquiring, intelligent people to join in.  I think the fool should be impeached for violating the separation of church and state.  He did get one thing right (quite by accident I'm sure) in that lengthy BS he called a state of the union address.  He said, &quot;If . . . Then evil has no meaning.&quot;  Bingo.  Evil has no meaning; it's totally subjective.  It's a question/answer of perspective and value.  Using Bush's own definition of evil, Bush is far more evil than Saddam.  However, if you enjoy his dog and pony show, keep on supporting him.  Ancient wisdom says the people will vote for bread and circuses rather than anything productive or useful.  Enjoy your clown.<br>

First of all.. Separation of church and state?  you're getting your civics lessons from the papers apparently...<br>
<br>
THERE IS NO SUCH THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
The only thing that even comes close is this....<br>
<br>
&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof&quot;<br>
<br>
That does NOT mean that there has to be an absolute divide between church and state.  It's just the excuse idiots use to push anything vaguely religious out of schools.<br>
<br>
I am not a religious man and I don't give a SHIT about religion one way or the other, but i'll be god damned if i'm gonna sit and listen YET AGAIN while someone tries to tell me that there is a separation of church and state.<br>

Saddam Hussein has been purposely thwarting UN weapons inspectors almost from the INSTANT that we withdrew from the Gulf.<br>

Saddam is an evil fucking man and the day he dies will be a day to mark on my calendar.  To bad it was over a decade too late.<br>

We don't have any separation of church and state when we have a leader basing his decisions for all of the people of this country on what he thinks his god wants.  If you want religion in schools and government, fine.  I insist that all religions should be included and respected, as well as the beliefs of those folks who follow no religion.  To force a whole country into war as a result of his personal religious convictions is utter bullshit.  Why can't Bush and people like him learn that ethics and religion are not one and the same?  He shouldn't be promoting any religion or god while he represents an entire country.  He has responsibilities to all of his constituents, not just the ones who share his religion.  <br>
<br>
By the way, I can discuss politics reasonably and politely and respectfully and must do so almost daily.  I appreciate that I need not do so in this forum.  In other words I'm offering a disclaimer that you all may bear the brunt of my frustration and backlash from other, more polite conversations elsewhere.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

What gets me is this: Saddam is hardly the only one out there doing nasty shit. What about China and what it's done to Tibet? Or abuses that go on all the time in 3rd-world countries run by warlords or tin-pot dictators? If our main reason for taking out Hussein is that he is committing evil acts, then there are a lot of other countries and dictators that we should also invade.<br>
<br>
So why aren't we?<br>
<br>
That's why I roll me eyes whenever I hear Bush yapping on about how wonderful and altruistic the US is, and how we've got &quot;God&quot; on our side, blah blah blah. What a pile of crap.<br>

Well that would just be too damned difficult, even for the good ole USA.  A war with China would touch off WWIII, there's no doubt in my mind.  So we carry on a somewhat more cordial relationship hoping that democracy will eat the bastards from within.<br>
<br>
Iraq has been on our plate before. The USA is the ones that forced these conditions upon them.  If Iraq doesn't abide by the agreement then who is going to step in there?<br>

Not any of the people in Europe that no longer have the balls for conflict.  Not Saddam's arab neighbors...<br>
<br>
Who?<br>
<br>
Only the U.S.<br>

Isn't this our responsibility since we're the ones that are responsible for him in the first place?  He's gone horribly awry, there is no one else to stop him, but us. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

So, there are lots of places that we could invade based on humanitarian criteria. Of those we chose Iraq.<br>
<br>
What makes Iraq so special? Particularly considering that Iraq has been committing these atrocities for decades. Are the humanitarian concerns suddenly a zillion times worse there? In regards to how he treats the people of his country, Hussein isn't doing anything now that he wasn't doing several years ago, when he was our <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ally</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Saying that we are invading Iraq for humanitarian reasons is like saying you're eating a chocolate bar for the gram of protein listed on the back under &quot;RSDA Recommended amounts of vitamins and minerals.&quot;<br>
<br>
IMO, we are invading IRAQ for a lot of reasons, and it pisses me off that our leadership is bullshitting us about why.  If the real reasons are good ones, then Bush shouldn't need human rights rhetoric to sell this war to the public.<br>

My first instinct is to say, &quot;Yeah! We've got to stop Hussein from getting weapons of mass destruction!&quot; But then I wonder, just what criteria are we using? I mean, why can some countries have them but not other countries? Who gets to decide that? I'd prefer that NO countries had weapons of mass destruction, but the cat's already out of that particular bag.<br>

<br>
We went to war when he invaded Kuwait. Who has he invaded since then? No one. That war was for the purpose of liberating Kuwait, wasn't it? So who are we going to war to liberate now...?<br>
<br>
I admit that I was flabbergasted that we didn't get rid of Hussein back then, but nothing new has happened since to make him deserve being taken out any more than he did then, when we chose not to. So why choose to now?<br>
<br>

<br>
At last, we agree on something. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We helped him come to power, we helped him stay in power, and we helped arm his military. So yeah, we damned well should take responsibility for him.<br>
<br>
But it would have been a hell of a lot less trouble if we'd been responsible about who we helped and what we did in Iraq in the first place. It's stupid to make a deal with the devil, then act outraged when you get jabbed with his pitchfork.<br>

I prefer that evil people not have access to weapons of mass destruction.  As much as everyone rails against Bush, he's not an evil man.  Hussein most assuredly is.  Would you feel comfortable if Hussein had the destructive power of the USA at his beck and call?  You may not feel comfortable with Bush in that position, but be honest...   Who would you fear more in that position?<br>
<br>
Saddam is producing these weapons.  He has helped terrorists financially and by allowing them refuge.  How long do you think it'll be before he starts providing them with deadlier weapons to boot?<br>
<br>
What's changed since the last war?  September 11th.<br>
<br>
Hussein is a part of the problem.  One<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> easily</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> rectified.<br>

Even our idiot president admits that Al Queda was responsible for September 11.  Last time I checked Iraq wasn't the same as Al Queda not was Saddam in charge of Al Queda so using that excuse is BULLSHIT.  And don't repeat that drivel about Al Queda forces operating in Iraq.  Al Queda forces are operating in France and America and England and many other countries.  I can't wait until the tanks and bombers show up to hit American cities.  Last time I checked it was wrong and evil to condem a whole people for the actions of a few.  <br>
