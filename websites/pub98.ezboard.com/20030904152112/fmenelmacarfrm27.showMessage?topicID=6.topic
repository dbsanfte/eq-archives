In the beginning, there was a forum called Apolyton dedicated to the game Civilization II. I and another Apolytoner, Evan von Christoph, discovered micronationalism and tried to get some of the Apolytoners to form a micronation together. It didnt work. After two weeks, Apolyton Independent Nation collapsed through people getting bored and not participating in the elections. This took place from August 6 to August 17, 1999. The two people who did not get bored with micronationalism, Bill Dusch and Iain Lindley, moved to Morovia and did some politics over there.<br>
Evan asked me to try again in late November of that year, and we did. For copyright reasons, we changed the name from Apolyton to Audentior. Audentior flourished, and Bill and Iain returned, as did many other Apolytoners. The population skyrocketed with the easy citizen base the forum provided. Soon it was at a hundred, although not all were active.<br>
Bill, however, was interested in testing his new government form, Demesos, and left Audentior to found the United Demesos. He attracted even more Apolytoners into micronationalism with it, and somewhat annoyed the Audentes, who were hoping to keep a unified front. The Audentes assumed Bill would just go away and Apolyton micronationalism would be united once again soon enough. They decided to wait. Theyre still waiting.<br>
Meanwhile, I met a friend in my social studies class who I thought was the sort of person who would be good at micronations. I invited him to Audentior. At first he thought it was the stupidest idea he had ever heard, but soon it grew on him. He joined, and started his own political party. I was right about him being good at it  too good. He recruited some more Apolytoners (including some people named Jason Steffke and Tony Au) and then (holding some kind of weird grudge against me for whatever reason) turned his party against the Audente government of the time. His name was John Drake Sager, but he was usually called JDS.<br>
After a major war of words and political battle, his party, the Automatic For The People (AFTP) revolted (this is Feb 2000). I tried to rally the Parliament to declare war, but they werent interested. Luckily, the United Demesos, which was afraid AFTP was looking to take them over, was, and attacked. (also around this time, Bill recruited someone he knew from elsewhere on the Internet to be a high Demesosian official  his name was Erik Metzler) And Evan, who was leading the super-secret and extremely competent Audentior Intelligence Agency, convinced the AFTP Communist Party to revolt. Finally, some people calling themselves Ceres who we had never heard of randomly came in and attacked AFTP too. A third group of Automatics under Jason Steffke left to form the Flying Islands of Jasonia rather than participate in the absurd conflict. We were happy. It looked John and his bunch would go away after all. This was the Automatic War.<br>
But AFTP and the communist rebels decided to remerge into a Communist country called the Great Automatic Peoples Republic. Peace treaties were signed with Ceres and the United Demesos, although the United Demesos never really stopped hating them. Evan was, needless to say, not pleased. He decided that since Audentior was obviously the sort of two-ton gorilla of the area, it really ought to be able to take care of GAPR itself. It was just this annoying Parliamentary system and bureaucratic inefficiency that was holding it back. So he got the intel services and military to back him in a revolt to make him Emperor. (plus he was EZOp, which helps). At first I was against this, but when he said he was going to do it anyway I figured if I helped him I could prevent a bloody civil war. This was in fact what happened. About five or six Audentes (remember that our population was so large that five or six did not pose a problem) left under the leadership of Mark Laanen, the rightful Prime Minister, and were given refuge in the GAPR, which had really gotten this whole international politics thing down. Evan then built a huge military machine and tested it on ACOL, a forum that had been a traditional Apolyton rival. We didnt do so well, but we got it on a technicality. This demoralized a lot of people, and it was almost time for an election. GAPR double citizens started infiltrating trying to bring the system down. Mark Laanen was spreading his propaganda, and we probably had a number of their infiltrators with us. Evan thought the situation was dire enough that he had to ban all dual citizens. He did, and we lost most of our best and brightest people. Lots of Audentes started clamoring for a return to the Republic. Evan refused. I got very annoyed and left along with my best micronational friend at the time, Lord Adam Stone. A few days later, Evan abdicated, but it was too late. Audentior was dead.<br>
Adam and I decided to found a new type of country, Hyperborea, which would be less into the politics and intrigue and could stay neutral and concentrate on culture (this wasnt exactly new  Jasonia had done it a month before, but neither of us thought they had done it too well). In the meantime, Bill and Erik had a falling out, and Erik left the United Demesos and founded Shireroth, a nice little democratic nation which, for almost a year, got absolutely nowhere.<br>
Remember when I said Bill and the UD had never really forgiven the GAPR? Well, somehow (and were not clear how) he got their forum password, attacked them, and took them over. Unfortunately, he didnt do a very good job. The GAPR not only got their password back, but took Bills in the process. A coalition of them and Jasonia then took over the United Demesos. This was the Demesosian War.<br>
Bill became a citizen of Jasonia so they could keep watch over him. Also, a new body was created to regulate international politics  the Apollo Confederacy (we had wanted to call it the Apolyton Confederacy, but copyright issues again reared their ugly heads, and so we randomly chose Apollo as the name for our Sector since it sounded a lot like Apolyton and was a cool name and god), which was similar to the UN in being very good at bickering and somewhat less good at getting stuff done. Bill decided to revive the United Demesos spirit by creating Tapfer, which didnt really get off the ground. Matt Lamantia created a tiny nation called MyNation that was more of a parody than an actual country. And a country called Istvanistan introduced itself to the rest of us, claiming to be a descendent of the old Apolyton Nation that had existed for eight months in total isolation. Noticing that there were a lot of little nations with barely any people in them, John suggested we merge. Everyone was up for it, but John changed his mind at the last moment. But the rest of the Confederacy merged anyway (that is, Hyperborea, Shireroth, Tapfer, and Jasonia  Blackrock and Istvanistan demurred). I managed to pressure everyone else into making the merge a new Audentior, and in fact we used the old Audente forum for it. By this time, Evan von Christoph was long gone, so he wasnt a problem.<br>
The new Audentior, besides getting set up, had a major goal  get rid of GAPR. As long as they existed, they were a menace and a threat. Luckily, this was a lot easier now than in the days of the Audente Empire. Time had not treated the communist nation well, and they had succumbed to a common micronational disease of changing their name every five minutes so that no one knew who they were. There wasnt too much activity either. The Audentes covertly supported Erik Metzler for their leadership in their election (as opposed to a loyal soldier named Patrick Foley), and Metzler won. He had a number of misgivings, but eventually the Audentes convinced him to give the nation over to them and Ceres (which had just renamed itself Blackrock). Metzler claims to regret this, but if he does, hes crazy. They had to be eliminated.<br>
Audentior did extremely well for a month. Everyone had a lot of fun doing crazy stuff like news broadcasts and playing bagpipes and that sort of stuff before trouble started. The Audente government was a republic, but many of the former Jasonians wanted a direct democracy. I held a good deal of the power there, and I was opposed, as were some other non-Jasonians, so there was a big standoff. A new Apolytoner named Ryan Caruso (called WarVoid) joined up and became something of a leader of the pro-democracy team. One day when I was away on vacation, they took the whole thing over. When I got back, we worked out a compromise with some democracy. But definitely no President. Audentior was to remain executiveless. This caused two more riots, until finally we amended stuff again and said, okay, well have a President. Two parties, the Boomists and the Demesosians, both having surprisingly few beliefs besides the other party being the Antichrist, fielded candidates. The Demesosian candidate, Bill Dusch, won. Later investigation proved that he had mainly done so by getting inactive citizens to vote, getting random people to join just for the election, vote for him, then leave, and other not so ethical methods. Shireroth, a Boomist stronghold, said enough was enough and seceded. (this was July 00) Jasonia, which had never been particularly happy, seceded as well. Bill, despite apparently being in charge of the nation and having everything he wanted, decided a trend was a trend, and seceded with Tapfer as well. Finally, Hyperborea decided to get the heck out and left. The only person left, really, was WarVoid. This was the time that Evan von Christoph decided to make a random cameo appearance and declare himself High Priest. WarVoid declared himself Emperor. The two sat around talking about how great titles they had until they realized there was no one else left. Then they gave up, and Evan disappeared for the last time. A last-ditch attempt I made to keep Audentior going failed too.<br>
But no one was really used to independence, and so they decided to join with the biggest and best country, which at that time was Jasonia. Shireroth, Hyperborea, and Tapfer all became Jasonian provinces. WarVoid decided to stick it out for a while and founded The Republic of Antarctica, but that failed after a week and it became Jasonian too. John was still kind of around and created the Hawaiian nation of Hauoli Ena, but that didnt work either, so FIoJ swallowed it.<br>
Now (August 00) we get to what is called the Golden Age of Jasonia, which was famously called by Jason by far the best thing in the history of anything ever. Jasonia developed a huge culture, bits and pieces of which remain in the Apolloist religion thats being preached here. This was also the age of the first Control of Destiny game and of my first epic poem, the Jasoniad. Jason constructed a really nice tour, and many relations were contacted abroad. Bill Dusch became Chief of Staff, and a number of ministries flourished  a military which would seem pathetic these days but which was good for the era, a research department working on all kinds of brilliant and cutting-edge (if fictional) projects, the beginning of the Fireball, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.<br>
Then someone noticed that the Antarctica forum said Peoples Republic of Hell, was decorated in black and red, had a big pitchfork up, and that no one had seen WarVoid around for a while. The Jasonian Intelligence Nexus (of which I was the leader at the time) put two and two together, and we politely asked them if they were revolting against us. The basic answer was yes. WarVoid had made Antarctica into a new nation (ever wonder why the PRH board is called balu? It stands for board of the Antarctic Libertarian Union) and had gotten Erik (who Jasonia had kicked out for a minor spamming violation that had more to do with Bill being a biased judge than Erik actually committing a crime) and Eriks friend Dan as citizens. Jasonia told them they couldnt revolt, and PRH said yeah, just watch us. There was a brief cold war, but people got bored of that, so there was then a lukewarm war. People started getting banned, and Jason instituted a Spire with all kinds of secret plans and stuff. However, in the end, I managed to convince WarVoid that if Apollo unification was his goal (which it was) it would be easier to join with Jasonia than to try and conquer it. Jasonia and Hell merged, and Hell went away for a few years.<br>
But scarce had one province stopped trying to revolt when another one started. John had decided Hauoli Ena deserved a chance after all and was pulling it out of Jasonia. There was an epic debate over whether this was legal, the conclusions of which were 1) that John was doing it whether it was legal or not and 2) that John and Jason would now have to hate one another with a vengeance for the better part of a year.<br>
Hauoli Ena actually did very well. dStryker was given the opportunity to lead its economic system, and with the help of a few people who actually were interested in participating, it did very well indeed. Theres no knowing where Hauoli Ena wouldve gone if not for the events that happened later.<br>
Meanwhile, WarVoid was trying to set up a new Apollo Confederacy. Which he sort of did. But there wasnt much loyalty to it. Its attempts to set up a worldwide economic system ended in failure, which was probably my fault, and it never got Hauoli Ena to join fully, which was a crippling blow. Finally, when it would rather be working on something important it was constantly occupied in fighting tiny wars with a person whose name will not be mentioned beyond that it begins with a T and ends with a homas Hubert. <br>
During this period, (October 2000) two tragedies occurred. The first was that Blackrock, which had become a superpower and was just starting to build itself into a super-duper-power, decided to disband itself at the request of its leader, Shane Odlum. And second, Istvanistan also disbanded itself due to inactivity.<br>
At this time, the Rasinate published a foreign policy saying it would be cool if the Apollonians would unite. I mocked them in the Fireball saying this would never, ever, EVER happen. Diga said try it and see. So we did. Hauoli Ena, Jasonia, and Treesia decided to merge. Except that Jasonia and Treesia decided not to merge after all but just to sort of send their citizens over to Hauoli Ena, which would be the one doing the actual merging. When they figured out the structure, the Atterans also sent some citizens in the form of the state of Lesser Attera. Thus ended Hauoli Ena, and thus begun the Union of Apollo States.<br>
The UAS was a sort of cultural Golden Age, even if it didnt last too long. It had a great court system, probably the best of any Apollo nation ever, a very efficient and well-used legislature, the beginnings of the MCS map, an economy better than any of you who werent around back then have ever seen, and enough conflict to be interesting without being divisive. Or so we thought. That part didnt really turn out too well. The Jason/John feud became a huge powder keg that flared up at the tiniest little provocation, to the point where we almost fought a bloody civil war over what to call our currency. I was President, and I had the less-than-enjoyable job of constantly having to mediate conflicts between the two. One conflict finally broke out into an out-and-out riot in which the New Jasonians (the people from Jasonia who had joined the UAS) almost seceded but were held back at the last second. Finally, someone attacked Huberts new nation of Umoja. For whatever reason, the Jasonians thought it was the UAS government, which was hiding it just to spite them. They rioted again. This was too much. WarVoid, who had been a high potentate, resigned in disgust. So did Stjepan Aracic, who had been working on constructing the very promising state of Novi Dalmacija. Finally, so did I. The few people remaining (because most Jasonians and a good chunk of Johns faction had also pulled out) united under Patrick Foley, the former leader of the military. The Atterans also made an impassioned plea to stick together. However, John Sager teamed up with Thomas Hubert and attacked the remnants with a Spam Cannon, at that point the devices only real military use. Everything fell apart, and the Union of Apollo States died.<br>
With it died most of what had been the Apollo Sector. After that point, the history lacks the power and grandeur of what came before. It was no longer a coherent, traceable story but just one damn thing after another. Many of the great Apollonians left in disgust, never to return again. And the air of anything-at-all-is-possible gave way to an air of resignation and the belief that everything wastes away and dies sooner or later, often more sooner than later. There is more Apollo history, but its barely worth telling, and will be covered under the headings of the original countries, because from this point on the Sector is individual countries, not a single great mass. But in this period, from January to November 2000, some of the greatest advances in micronationalism ever were discovered and implemented, and I feel privileged to have been a part in it, or to be in a society where it has existed at all.<br>
