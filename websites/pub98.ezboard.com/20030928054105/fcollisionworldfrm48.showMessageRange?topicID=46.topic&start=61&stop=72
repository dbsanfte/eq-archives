Held himself closer to him in his sleep, and sighed - then his body fell limp, the glow from his wings disappearing.<br>
And it was always a fright if an angel &quot;died&quot;, seeing as they didn't breath to begin with, so there was no pulse unless they got excited or scared.<br>
~*~<br>
Kokoru grinned cockily. &quot;Well, I'm sure you've never had one like me before.&quot; Then he turned, and began walking towards Yukari and Ayashi, his next course of &quot;playboy&quot; action - or lack of it rather - forming in his mind. <p>&quot;...Holding on to an unfulfilled wish, I travel high above the lonely sky...&quot; -Tooi Yoake</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>#3 hall of fame winner</span><br>  Posts: 1698<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(7/20/03 8:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> yah really...hmm (*needs fina somewhere else soon*)</span><hr size=1> Fina eyed the devil curiously, following him while Talon had crawled onto her head. <br>

Then he waved his hand as if to shoo her away. &quot;Have fun, beautiful,&quot; he said and winked back at her. His violet-red eyes fell back to Ayashi as he neared him and the girl, and he stopped in his tracks blinking.<br>
<br>
Something within him seemed to waver, and weaken, and he slowly sunk to the ground massaging his forehead - his shoulders shaking. [Wee! Kokoru angst! ^^;]<br>
~*~<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>His hand reached towards the boy, shaking violently. He didn't want to touch that bloody body, sliced and diced so grotesquely like some random vegetables. The blood dribbled down the boy's pale skin, glowing in the moonlight that flooded the windows. The gauze curtain drifted between Ayashi's hand and the boy's face, surprisingly intact, making the boy drift away like the after image of a dream.<br>
<br>
He couldn't do it. The angel pulled away suddenly, wings curling around his body - blocking the boy's mutilated body from his view. He felt tears collect behind his eyelids, and he tried flying back to (wherever he came from), but he knew he couldn't... This boy and girl could be saved... Reached out again, making the sign of the cross on the girl's forehead, then moved to [Kokoru].</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Ayashi woke with a start, jolting upright and standing, stumbling slightly. His eyes were wide, sweat rolling down the side of his face. Massaged his forehead again, remembering the vertigo that threatened to overcome all his senses... He caught Kokoru sitting on the street, just gazing at him with teary eyes, and Ayashi paled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kokoru...&quot; he whipered, and floated towards the devil. He wrapped his arms around him, the demonic creature shaking in his arms. But then, Ayashi wasn't too stable either...<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you doing here, Kokoru?&quot; he asked softly, stroking the devil's hair. &quot;I thought you left already, with Sakamae...(where'd she go anyway? Probably back to hell to wait for Styce! XD)&quot;<br>
<br>
Kokoru blinked slowly, and he gripped the white robes tighter. The white robes and then the black seemed to perfect opposites and negatives of each other... [pretty picture! *_*]<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know...&quot; he said quietly, and everything in his mind seemed to disappear... all that mattered was that he was being held in Ayashi's arms, which had been what he had wanted for so long... He sobbed quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;..I-if it's something I did, Kokoru-...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not you!&quot; Kokoru cried suddenly, pulling away slightly to look at him with wide eyes - glittering. Then he fell back against him, his lithe body racking with silent sobs. &quot;It...it's not you, Ayashi...&quot;<br>
<br>
The angel sighed queitly, his eyes regaining the worry again.<br>

Everyone she'd ever know closley had told her that. And  that day she'd met that prophetess...she had been so curious as to if she'd ever find love. All the prophetess had told her was &quot;You'll die without love, me dear. I'm sorry.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Your woman needs you...more than I do, Ayashi...&quot; he said, and his hands fell limply to his sides. Stood, swaying, and rubbed his eyes. As his fingers fell back, his tears glittered and dried in the air like jewels... [bishounen sparkle?]<br>
<br>
&quot;Ko--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be fine,&quot; he said, lifting the angel up to his feet and turning him, then pushed him towards Yukari.<br>
<br>
&quot;But--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just go!&quot; Kokoru said, red staining his cheeks. His pointy nails dug into the angel's back, in between the shoulder blades lined with downy feathers. Ayashi winced slightly, but didn't turn. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yukari...&quot; he whispered, sitting back down. &quot;...Why are you crying, dearest..?&quot; He pressed his lips to each of her eyelids, kissing the droplets away while wrapping his arms around her body. &quot;..Don't cry, dearest... Please.&quot;<br>
<br>
He didn't ask why she was crying; she would say something if she wanted to tell him. Or so he believed. He glanced at Kokoru, who was on the roof of the empty warehouse again, staring up at the moon that was starting to rise...<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Are you all right...?&quot; he asked softly, kissing her forehead. &quot;I'm sorry...if I've been worrying you...&quot; He beat himself mentally everytime he seemed to do something wrong, when he got worried she seemed to get worried also, but he never regretted meeting her..<br>
<br>
~*~<br>
<br>
Kokoru looked up at the moon, his legs hanging over the side of the building and elbows resting on his thighs. He sighed, wings tightening to his back to conserve what little warmth a being like him held. For living in a place that was eternally damned and filled with fire, devils were usually always cold...<br>
<br>
He closed his eyes, sighing slightly.. But that warmth coming from Ayashi was like nothing any fire could do for him.. A shiver run up his spine, and a sob caught in his throat. A hand covered his mouth, and his eyes closed. Of course he wanted Ayashi... he wanted to be with him forever, even if it meant disobeying Satan... But... Yukari was the one that had his heart now...<br>
<br>
He whirled around as a hand came to rest upon his shoulder, and his eyes narrowed as he realized it was Sakamae. &quot;What the hell do you want?&quot; he asked waspishly, glaring at her.<br>
<br>
Sakamae smiled slightly. &quot;I...I'm leaving to go back home...&quot; she said. &quot;I got word Styce just arrived, and I want to be there right now... He got injured on his duties...&quot;<br>
<br>
Kokoru blinked. Styce was an okay guy- better than his sister, that was for sure. He had never done anything to reach a grudge with Kokoru.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then go,&quot; he said, and turned away. &quot;Hope he gets better, soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sakamae took her hand back, slowly, and she frowned a little. Nodded, then disappeared in a flash of a shadow. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>#3 hall of fame winner</span><br>  Posts: 1718<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(7/21/03 3:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *sniff*</span><hr size=1> Yukari attempted to shake her head in the position she was currently. &quot;Nothing you've done.&quot; She whispered, her voice obviously carrying her depression and worry. <br>

<br>
How could she die without love? She'd lived without love her whole life...she couldn't possibly imagine dying without it now that she had it. Her body cuddled even closer to Ayashi's, and she sighed, finding comfort only in the hold she'd grown so addicted to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0
