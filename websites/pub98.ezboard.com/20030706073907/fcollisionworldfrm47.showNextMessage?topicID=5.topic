Crow looked around with interest.  Lots of flowery type things... Well, it made sense, considering the enviroment.  But Crow wasn't one for common sense.<br>
He sat down on a chair and was careful not to knock anything over with his synteshart.<br>
Blinking, he watched as Derla went around locking the door and shutting all the windows.  <br>
<br>
Hmmm... Takes some precautions.  I wonder...<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd ask what you were doing, but I guess I'll find out anyway,&quot; he said, meaning her promise to tell him about herself when they arrived at their destination.  He leaned forward, expectantly, like a little kid during Story Time.  HIs 3i glinted golden in what little there was of the light, all the windows having been drawn shut.<br>

I was beaten and throughn in a ditch by a man when I was younger. From then on, I never made any friends or wanted a family and I ran away from everyone and everything. Then, one day I was hiding in a park, in a bush and I touched the ground and consintrated on a beautiful purple flower and there it was, coming up the ground through my fingers. People have put up rewards and things for me and other missing children for years. I ran and evaded each one. Then I came here, where no one knows more about someone than anyone else and I made a living off my gifts. I can heal, stun and grow things with my hands, if I can visuallise it. The reason I got so upset is because I could've sworn I saw the man...THe man that beat me all those years ago, come back for me!&quot; derla waited for his reaction.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kerrifairy05>KerriFairy05</A> at: 2/22/03 11:52:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/22/03 1:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Floral Shop</span><hr size=1> OOC: Yes...

Crow stared at the girl; the information had come out so fast he was caught halfway between enjoying the stillness of the little shop and abject shock.<br>
He looked at the seeds in Derla's hand and wondered if he was hungry enough to eat them.  &quot;...Do you know who this man was?&quot; he asked, numbly, there being precious else little he could say.  No wonder she was so paranoid!  Traumatized, he thought, reverting his gaze to a potted plant to his left.  No wonder...<br>

<br>
<br>
Crow was so confident in his belief that anyobdy should be able to trust him he almost laughed out loud.  He realized this would have been a stupid mistake and caught himself in time.  <br>
Looking up at Derla, he smiled, reassuringly.  &quot;Of course you can trust me!  I know you have a lot of reasons not to... But I can say in all fairness that of all the people you could have met, I'm one of the most trustworthy out there...&quot;  He cocked his head to one side, his 3i flashing.  &quot;In fact there are not enough letters in the word 'trust' to fully express the trustworthiness of... uh... yeah, I think you get the point.&quot;<br>
<br>
During his little rant, Crow noticed Derla peeking at his synteshart.  He half turned in his seat, glancing at the deadly looking blades.  &quot;And don't worry about this.  The synteshart is for self-protection only.&quot;<br>
As he said this, Crow got an idea.  He'd win the girl's trust and become her friend, or die trying.  She needed him, and he felt the need to help her somehow...<br>
<br>
&quot;Trust me...&quot; he said quietly, holding out his hand to the girl, &quot;trust me, and I'll protect you.&quot;<br>

He drew his synteshart carefully out of its sheath, having to twist awkwardly in his chair to get at it.  &quot;Well, besides being seemingly immortal, that is...&quot;<br>
The twin blades of his weapon glinted in the faded light as Crow turned the long metal shaft, one end carving spirals in the air.  &quot;At any rate, immortal or not... This'll keep him at bay for a while, if he survives it,&quot; Crow assured Derla, smiling.<br>

I don't know what he is, but he's not normal, for any sort of creature. He's too fast, too unpredictable to be totally human, if at all. It's like he was sent by an immortal to retrieve people's souls and I'm the next target.&quot; She looked outside. &quot;I thank you for trying to protect me, Crow, but I think we're in over our head here.

<br>
Somewhat disheartened by Derla's despairing words, Crow stopped fiddling around with the synteshart and just gazed at her while she tidied up the room.<br>
After a few minutes of watchful silence, Crow dug out the scrap of paper he had swiped off Derla's shirt in the streets, along with a cracked ballpoint pen.  He began jotting down the man's description that Derla had given him before.  &quot;Okay, so, fast and possibly immortal... and maybe a little messed up in the head.&quot;  He thought for a moment, making connections in his head.<br>
&quot;Hmm... You know, he could be a jaded assassin or something.  I've heard of lots of hitmen who have killed too many for it to be fun anymore, so they just roam around randomly picking people off... Or sometimes merely playing with them, like you said.&quot;  He shrugged.  &quot;It's just a possibility.&quot;<br>
<br>
/Kaiwron Syntharsis wo yoursylv sylvisthess umenth,/ the voice whispered into the still air.<br>
<br>
Crow appeared not to have noticed.  <br>

Unaware of Derla's somewhat morbid but perfectly justified thoughts, Crow looked up from where he was musing over his little bit of paper.<br>
&quot;Oh... The 3i?  It does that sometimes.&quot;  As if to emphasize his words, the 3i spoke again.<br>
<br>
/Kaiwron Syntharsis wo yoursylv sylvisthess umenth... kivi kuersynten.../<br>
<br>
Crow's two normal eyes blinked.  &quot;As you have probably noticed, that was a completely different language.  It alternates between the two, but it hardly ever says anything in one tongue that it doesn't repeat in the other.&quot;<br>
Shrugging lightly, Crow returned to his notes, trying to memorize them.  &quot;I can understand it, and I can speak it, but I don't know anyone else who can.  I admit... It's really strange.&quot;  He grinned, and added, &quot;You have a right to remain freaked out.&quot;<br>
<br>
A few minutes passed by.  Derla seemed rather tense, causing Crow to look up again.  &quot;Is there something on your mind?  Something other than what's usually on your mind, anyway,&quot; he said, puzzled by his friend's consistently fearful behaviour.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes, Crow was just a little to carefree to understand how other people could live in a state of almost permanent anxiety.<br>

Crow looked slightly depressed.  First the 3i, and now Derla... They had both suggested that he leave.  What was this?  He had gotten himself involved in something deep and he, according to the rules of his somewhat exuberant lifestyle, sure wasn't going to back out now.  <br>
<br>
Especially since he was forever and now bound to Derla, in his mind...<br>
<br>
He sighed and flipped the paper over.  &quot;Derla... Do you really think I'd leave you after hearing that story?  I'd have to be a tad on the callous side, with a selfish value for my own personal safety over others.&quot;  He smiled gently.  &quot;Look... If you don't think I'm all like that... Then please don't persuade me to leave.  Don't make me break my promise, 'kay?  I won't be happy.&quot;<br>
Still grinning as he said these last words, Crow bent back to his pen.<br>
<br>
/Crow.  Take the girl.  Leave the city./<br>
<br>
And, immediantly following that;<br>
<br>
/Kairwron Syntharsis.  Dernwyss wyl sytentepsith yan./<br>
<br>
In the middle of scribbling down Kuro Kage's name, Crow suddenly looked up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Funny... S' never done that before...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
