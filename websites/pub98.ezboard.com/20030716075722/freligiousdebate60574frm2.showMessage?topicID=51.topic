If this is all there is (i.e. this life), then how would you justify ever taking someone's life, minus this belief.  And now that I think about it, if our justice system has no basis in religion at all, isn't it incredible that it would sanction the death penalty, given that officially they don't believe in an afterlife of any kind.. it's so... final.

<br>
Hope you don't mind me answering here (since I am agnostic... not atheist <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Personally, I do not advocate the death penealty. To me, it is an act of revenge (Like the US bombing Afganastan in the name of &quot;justice&quot;... but that's a different story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and I, for one, feel that revenge is a natural basic human response, but it should be restrained for more &quot;advanced&quot; (if you will) human judgement. The way I look at it is this: <br>
<br>
Two kids are playing on the playground. Kid #1 shoves Kid #2. Kid #2 falls in the mud. Kid #2 gets angry and embarrassed, so she hits Kid #1. Why did Kid #2 do this? Revenge. I was hurt/embarrassed, so you will pay. <br>
<br>
I realize that murder is much worse than a playground spat, but the outcome (with the death penelty) is the same. Murderer takes away family member and is found guilty. Family feels justified when death penelty is carried out. ie... He killed my family member, now he is taken away from his. I have heard it called closure, but like I said... sounds more like revenge to me.<br>

<br>
Wow--that's exactly right! For me anyway<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Besides the fact that it also strikes me as an act of revenge and is not applied fairly among ethnic groups even in the US, it is irrevocable. Even if there is a heaven, this should give pause to folks and it always amazes me when xians (whose savior was a victim of the death penalty poorly applied) favor this. I think jail is definitely in order and I'm not for parolling these guys, but killing them is not logical nor does it in any way solve the problem or act as an effective deterrent.<br>
<br>
Now I totally understand wanting your loved one's killer dead--that's a natural reaction and kudos to anyone who can overcome it, but we cannot base our justice system on the emotional desires of the victim. Society must take the higher path, ensure everyone's rights are honored and provide an avenue for which errors can be corrected or at least stopped.<br>

For various reasons. (For the record, I'm agnostic... well sort of)<br>
<br>
I think it is a penalty that is not uniformly applied, and the majority of people who are executed fall within the lowest income bracket.<br>
<br>
People have been executed or on death row and have been found to be innocent of the crime they are said to have commited.  That in itself is enough to question it's validity.<br>
<br>
The death penalty hasn't proven to be a deterrant to crime.  The example I'm thinking of is Canada, where they found violent crime actually went up after they reintroduced the death penalty - it was later repealed.<br>
<br>
Then again I think prison has become a little too cushy, it should be a punishment and not rec time.  I find it rather ironic that prisoners are given universal health care in the prison system, while there are millions of people who do not have adequate health care.<br>

When so many people are sitting on the outside who would love to do those things but don't have the money to do so. I also think they should give sex offenders the death penalty after so many offenses. They have proven that &quot;rehab&quot; doesn't work for the vastthese people.

I say, you get life, you go out in a coffin. <br>
<br>
We hate to hear about jails being cushy, but it is easier to control prisoners and prevent riots if they can work out their energies (exercise, work) and numb their brains with TV or even improve them with books. It also gives the guards something they can take away for behavior modification. If it's all just crappy and miserable, what would be the point in behaving? I wouldn't want our prisons to be like turkish prisons where they just send you to rot. Let's face it, no matter how cushy the prison, it is still a complete loss of privacy, freedom and liberty.<br>
<br>
People on death row appeal endlessly (and who can blame them?), making death row more expensive than just housing them the rest of their natural lives. On the other hand, my heart is hardly bleeding for someone facing the death penalty, because they murdered someone and that someone did not get even a trial, a chance to say goodbye, or anything. The death row inmate has it a lot better than the person he murdered, IMO.<br>

<br>
I agree with Stacy in that our judicial system should not be a vehicle for exacting revenge on behalf of the victims of crime.  I find the idea of &quot;closure&quot; a farce, and don't believe for one moment that anyone who's loved one died in the Oklahoma City bombing felt any less mournful the day after Timothy McVeigh was executed (though they may well have told themselves they did.)  George Orwell wrote a fabulous essay entitled, &quot;Revenge is Sour.&quot;  He forwards the idea that revenge - the &quot;romantic&quot; notions we've attached to our ideas of revenge, believing that it will be fulfilling, pleasurable, etc. -is an illusion.  I believe he is right.<br>
<br>
I don't see how we, as a civilized society, can deem the death penalty appropriate simply because it's cheaper to kill them than to incarcerate them.  <br>
<br>
I also agree with DL that maintaining a humane environment in prisons is important for a number of reasons -- I for one would hardly consider a stint in a maximum security facility a picnic, regardless of how often I got to work out, read, or educate myself.  And, since lack of education is at the root  of so much of what ails this country, I whole-heartedly support any effort even the most violent criminals might make toward improving their minds.  <br>
<br>
I see Leah's point:  that higher education isn't affordable and available to every citizen of the country is grossly outrageous.    But taking education out of prison reform is a step in the wrong direction.<br>
<br>
The bottom line, in my eyes, is that murder is murder.  We're supposed to be the good guys.<br>

I do not agree with the way our system works at the moment - you get a life sentence for murder, but only have to serve 25 years before you can apply for parole.  If life really meant life behind bars then I would agree with it much more.<br>

There has been a time when I sweated to my next af, when I was raped. I don't know, even after having two children I adore, if I could have kept my sanity and be pregnant from that incounter. I don't think its anyone else's right to question the choice a woman makes, except perhaps the father's. I'm not sure over that issue. But the rest of the world should just butt out of her body, no pun intended.<br>

I didn't think so.<br>
<br>
Here's my side of the story:<br>
<br>
I used to be one of those pro-choicers who was sure I'd never have an abortion myself. There I was, happily married, stay at home mom, one kid, wanted another one. Got pregnant ON PURPOSE. Thrilled!!!!<br>
<br>
Then, at my ultrasound I learned my baby had very severe multiple defects and could not survive. His &quot;life&quot; would have been a few days or weeks of suffering, then death. (I had very thorough testing done, so anti-choice folks please spare me the stories about your friend who had a bad triple screen or a sloppy diagnosis, because it really doesn't apply here.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
As a mother, I had to make a choice for my baby: Suffer and die at birth, or die painlessly at 20 weeks gest. I feel I made the most compassionate, loving decision for him - but it was emotionally devastating for me to lose a loved and wanted baby. I had a late term labor induction abortion which was very difficult. He was stillborn fully intact (so spare me the horror stories about what abortion does to the fetus.) We named him and buried him on the family plot.<br>
<br>
When it comes to termination after a very poor pre-natal diagnosis, I have yet to hear ONE reason not to do it that doesn't mention &quot;god.&quot; This wasn't about &quot;god&quot; this was about my right, hell, my RESPONSIBILITY to spare my baby suffering. If I had been the one in his tiny shoes, I would have wanted to be spared in the exact same way. Adoption was no option as it would have spared my baby nothing.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is, were it not for Roe v. Wade I would have had no choice but to carry this doomed little baby to term and let him suffer. The truth is, people who do this because they think &quot;god&quot; wants them to and imagine that letting their baby suffer will secure their own cozy spot in &quot;heaven&quot; make me want to puke<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
When it comes to abortion in general, I think it is crucial to women's rights and women who don't support it are foolish and deluded. Do I think it's a baby? Yes, but I think it is HER baby and since she is the one who is risking pregnancy, health, family, relationships, finances and career, it HAS to be the HER choice. To take that choice away is to destroy a woman's right to control her life. Birth control is grand but no method is 100% effective. To say she shouldn't have had sex is to say a baby is punishment for sex! If the law will force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, I say the jerks who get them pregnant should have to sit in prison til the baby is 18. (THAT would curb unwanted pregnancies!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
To pretend like adoption is viable in every situation is downright naive. Forcing it would put women with unwanted pregnancies in the position of being gestation slaves for rich, childless couples. If a pg woman WANTS to do it, great! Some of my best friends are adopted. But it's no love story when the pg woman has no choice - it then becomes a major hardship and again is punishment for having sex<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

And there is no such thing as abortion for &quot;convenience.&quot; Pregnancy is like having your body hijacked for 9 months followed by becoming a body servant to a baby-child for 18 years.

For the most part, I am pro-death penalty.  I figure that if you are cold-hearted enough to end the life of another, then you don't need to be around here depleting resources.  I just have no sympathy for cold-blooded murderers.  I do have some concerns about the death penalty though.  My latest concern is that they have been finding DNA evidence for people on death row to prove that they were innocent.  This shows our system needs an overhaul real quick.  If we need to suspend the death penalty until the authorities get their act together, then so be it.  I think this issue needs to be moved to the forefront regardless of whether the death penalty exists because I wouldn't want to spend my life in jail for a murder I didn't commit anymore than I would want to be put to death for it.  <br>
<br>
I am also pro-choice FTR.  I wouldn't consider an abortion for myself unless there were extenuating circumstances, but I do want the option available in the event of those extenuating circumstances, and it isn't my place to force having a child on another woman.<br>

<br>
Oddly enough, our compassion to allow a capital offender due process requires we exhaust their appeals before letting them be murdered.  This frequently (in the case of well represented clients) can overrun local budgets and drive the expense through the roof costing ten times what life in prison would.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>as far as the death penalty goes, there isnt enough of it, the punishment needs to match the crime, it needs to be swift and sure,thats whats wrong with our system, nothing is swift or sure, if you have a good lawyer or big bucks the punishment doesnt match the crime<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Simpleton, you are a very frightening individual.  Swift and sure?  How can it be swift and sure when half the capital offenders are in on questionable circumstantial evidence?  How about the fact that so many of the executed are later exonerated for their crimes?  If you were the kids in ‘My Cousin Vinney” and they railroaded you into an electric chair, how is justice served?  Killing the accused just closes the door on justice and eliminates our ability to correct the mistake if we later find the real killer.<br>
<br>
I do not support the death penalty.  It is an ineffective deterrent, and our government does it poorly.  The ones who go to jail for this are typically high media profile and it serves the career of the politician to demonize them and get a conviction, irrespective of where the truth may stand.  The service of societies best interests are in sequestering the offenders, not killing them.  Once we have an infallible system, perhaps, but until then I cannot support it.  Perhaps if we weren’t flooding our prisons with these simple drug offenders it wouldn’t be such a burden to house the true threats to society.<br>

<br>
Are you seriously suggesting we model any aspect of our society after a middle eastern country?  Are you willing to lower crime at the cost of your civil - even your basic human - rights?  You think it's grand that they chop off the hands of thiefs. . . how do you feel about women who are executed for having an extra-marital affair, or lashed in public for violating strict dress codes?<br>
<br>
In contrast, we can look our European neighbors, who have substantially lower crime rates, better medical and social services, free higher education, and who, incidentally, abandonned capital punishment many years ago.  <br>
<br>
Still think the middle eastern nations are the ones we need to emulate?<br>
