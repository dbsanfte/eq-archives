The paint job is &quot;interesting&quot; to say the least, since it is a combination of maroon and yellow-brown chipped paint covered in all sorts of graffiti.  The windows are boarded up hap-hazardly from the outside, and the entire house seems to be tilted slightly to the right.<br>
<br>
As you walk up the broken stepping stones towards the front door, the sound of thumping bass grows louder.  Evidently, the party has already started.  You may notice the “out of order” sign taped over the doorbell.  If you are polite enough to knock on the door, you hear a random voice yell “Come in!”  As soon as you open the door you are met by a thick cloud of smoke, and a general yelling of  “Hey!” from the people inside, as if they actually know who you are.<br>
<br>
The inside of the house is actually very plush.  There are fine leather couches and beanbag chairs, large mirror topped tables, and a full bar (that obviously used to be a kitchen).  There are hundreds of “pop-art” paintings covering the walls, and a full mural on the ceiling of a gigantic orgy.<br>
<br>
The room is filled with about thirty people and tons of drug paraphernalia.  Most of the people are entranced by the television, which is playing what looks like a colorful hippie screen saver.  The man closest to the door immediately turns to you as you enter “Are you straight edge?  ‘Cuz if you’re straight edge, Boomer called and said you should wait upstairs… or something.”<br>
<br>
You may choose to mingle if you would like -- it is your discretion.  When you decide to head upstairs, you would notice the sign on the door that says, “You are now entering the boom-boom room.  Prepare to have the time of your life.”  The upstairs is just one large room that has everything a good bachelor pad needs and then some.  An entire wallis covered with Polaroids of beautiful topless women.  Every electronic device necessary for the best home stereo that money can buy, and cables upon cables upon cables all shoved in one distant corner.  Next to that is a well kept desk with a very nice looking computer with all sorts of external devices sitting in a rack.  A few practically untouched leather sofas sit across from a big screen television that the average individual would wet themselves just looking are at on one side.  On the far end of the room there is an oversized, circular, rotating water bed that is obviously Boomers’ pride and joy.  In the center of the room there is a self serve bar with everything from alcohol to whatever else you could think of (including horse tranquilizers).<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
For the first person who arrives: There is a man sitting upstairs all by himself.  If you feel like talking to him, you find out that he was told to go to this house by a man in a yellow jacket who was sucking on a pacifier.  When he came to the door, he was told that he was “straight edge” and was sent upstairs.  So, he’s just waiting.  Mess with him as you wish.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
OOC: I do not care what you do at Boomers' place so long as it is done in character.  Eventually, I'll make another post, probably about starting &quot;Star Wars&quot; on the big screen TV.  You may mingle with the folks downstairs, make up their names, and make up their &quot;I'm ever-so-stoned&quot; diologue.  However if you kill them or something without covering it up, you may face reprocussions, so long as you do it in character, it is all fine by me.<br>
<br>
Hell, if you want to, you can even make up some of the random shit that Boomer might have in his house (like a 40 oz. bottle of lube) or on his walls (anything from old food to newspaper articles to a copy of the mona lisa with devil horns, etc.)  Play on! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=djboomer@scbnforum58570>DJBoomer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FF9300>(5/26/03 1:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Friday night</span><hr size=1> OOC: I don't know if you guys looked at this an' didn't know what this was in reference to, or what....<br>

He walks in the front door, and the man on the floor turns to him &quot;Hey, are you straight edge?  Cuz if you're straight edge, Boomer called and said that you should wait upstairs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Boomer stood there for a second, slightly confused. &quot;I'M Boomer you fuckin' moron.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yeah.  hey Boomer, hows it goin'?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright dickless, it's your turn to take out the trash.&quot;  Boomer did not like freeloaders.  That guy, well, he's a freeloader.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mitch, can you make a round of special drinks and take them upstairs for me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No one's here.&quot; Mitch replied.<br>
<br>
There was a long pause as Boomer attempted to think...<br>
<br>

<br>
A really long pause.....<br>

&quot;Yeah, sure&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you do me a favor and look up the fuckin address before you do it, cuz I guess I can't remember it right.... I guess we just chill down here till some one gets here.  Fuck.

As I (Sara) wondered if I should even be going out.  I wrap my arm around Steven's and  walk in the house.  The music was so load I could barely hear Steven say that he was going to find Boomer up stairs.  I notice some couples so making out so heavy that clothes had started coming off.  There were some people dancing to the music. I just stood and listened.  Some one came up to me and asked, &quot;Do you want a hit?&quot; as he waved a joint in front of my face.<br>
  &quot;No Thanks.&quot; I replied and laughed a little.  The rooms downstairs were so packed that it was hard to regonize faces. They all seemed to blur into one big rave party.  I started dancing to the side of the room near the wall away from everyone.  I closed my eyes and felt the beat throb on the floor and through the air.  I moved my body with the throb.  I then stopped.  Some one was watching me.  I knew.  I opened my eyes but could not see any one person gazing at me.  Until a girl moved out of the dance floor and there he was, the man in the dream, staring right at me.  Then a guy stepped in front of my view and when he moved the man was gone.  The next moment Steven was at my side saying something about going upstairs and so I followed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=djboomer@scbnforum58570>DJBoomer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FF9300>(5/29/03 7:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Upstairs</span><hr size=1> Sara and Steven walked into the plush upstairs room.  The music was still way too loud.<br>
<br>
Boomer got up off the couch and stumbled towards the new guests. He began talking at an incredible speed, with long unnecessary pauses. &quot;HEY!  What's up? glad someone made it.  And your name is.... wait... don't tell me....ah, gimmie a minute, it might come to me....fuck it, what was I saying?  Mitch, make these guys some drinks!  So, I was -- I was thinking we'd start th'-th'-the movie ra-right now -huh?- yeah, movie. So, it's starwars... the movie... so sit, get comfor'able an'... just sit, yeah.  I'll be right-- ummm...&quot;<br>
<br>
Boomer began to stand there staring at the wall with his mouth drooping open slightly.  Mitch brought a couple of drinks over and set them on the table near the door.  Boomer continued to space out until Mitch punched him softly in the arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right!&quot; Boomer went and sat down on the couch and stared at the blank television.  He did this for a while.  He is very good at it.<br>

He had waited until Boomer had arrived to his own party. Zarthus himself found it rude to enter a house without its host. He waited a moment before proceeding and found it to be a good call. He watched as Crowley and Sara stepped out of their car and approached the party. Zarthus found it extremely odd to see Crowley at a gathering such as this. Then smiled to himself. The only explanation he had was Crowley was surveying the party for any breaches of the masquerade. What a snoop that Crowley was.<br>
<br>
Zarthus moved swiftly toward the door making sure to put on his best &quot;face&quot;. As he entered the thresh hold a large smile crossed his face. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took a good look at those around him. Nothing but a bunch of inebriated kine for him to toy with. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh what fun. I haven't had an opportunity like this in ages. This should get interesting&quot; he whispered to himself. He began to walk through the crowd and looked for some poor sap to torture. His eyes locked onto a young female bobbing her head to the music looking dreamily into the crowd. He stared at her intensely and within moments her eyes shot up to meet his gaze. She smile slightly and grew a deeper shade of red. Zarthus returned her gaze with a slight nod. He paused for a moment to watcher her, then took a step forward disappearing behind some bodies. He girl attempted to look past the small crowd to find him again, but when he returned into view, it was someone else. This new visage she gazed upon was just as gorgeous and alluring as the first, but it wasn't the same person. <br>
<br>
She disregarded this, thinking it was just the drugs playing tricks on her so she smiled and continued her glossy eyed gaze. Zarthus continued his little game. He moved forward and again stepped behind a few dancers. When he emerged, he again had a different face. The girl started to worry. She rubbed her eyes and took a double take. When her eyes refocused, he looked different again. She began to grow nervous, her hands became extremely clammy and she began to shake. Her eyes were darting around the room and returning to Zarthus, who each time had a similar face, but not exactly the same. He began to approach her. Just as this happened someone walked directly infront of Zarthus. He took this opportunity and spun a complete 180 and walked deep into the crowd disappearing from her view. He chuckled to himself as he looked back to her as she grew incredibly paranoid and threw her drink to the floor and curled into a ball rocking herself sober. Zarthus smiled and moved to the stairs taking one last gander at the crowd. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have really got to get out more. That was just too much fun. But, first thing is first. Protection of the mas...&quot; He paused and chuckled to himself finishing the sentence in his head. He felt comfortable playing his games in Boomer's place... I mean realistically. Who would believe a bunch of drugged up kine that there was a guy walking around changing his face around?<br>

Boomer still sat, motionless.  Mr. Crowley and Sara had taken seats on the opposite side of the couch from him.  When the theme song started and the movie started, Boomer snapped out of it and looked over at Mr. Crowley suddenly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Woah! Fuck!&quot; Boomer jumped up on the couch awckwardly, then fell over backwards off the end of the sofa slamming himself to the floor. &quot;Holy shit.... don't sneak up on me like that... make a man go fuckin crazy, shit.&quot;  Boomer took a second to catch his breath (even though he didn't actually need to cuz he's dead) &quot;Steve-O, when'd you get here?  I didn't even see you come in.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before Crowley could get a word in edgewise, Boomer started talking again.<br>

&quot;Shhhhhhh!  The movie's starting!&quot;<br>

Boomer talks again &quot;Hey you guys want drinks?  Yeah you do, I know you do.  Mitch, get them some drinks!&quot;<br>

Its almost as if he's been there the whole time - but no one has really payed attention to him.  Reaching into the seeming endless pockets he has in his coat he pulls out a microwaveable package of popcorn and offers it to DJ Boomer, &quot;Hungry?  I brought this.&quot;  He doesn't look at Boomer, still watching the movie as it begins to unfold before him.  <br>
<br>
A few moments later, when the screen pulls back to show a landscape shot he mutters, &quot;...can't start a fire...you can't start a fire without a spark...&quot;  Then, more to Boomer he says, &quot;This party rocks.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then, he's gone - mentally at least, so engrossed in the film is he.<br>

Her usual calm exterior is belied only by a slight tightness around her mouth.  It had taken her several hours to calm the youngest of her coven.  She had taken the loss of the grove, which had been watched over by her mother, harder than most.<br>
  There was a guy sitting on the floor next to the door, obviously wasted.  &quot;You straight-edge.. fuck, 'course you straight-edge, fuckin hippy chicks.  Boomer called and... wait, didn't I see Boomer?&quot;  He began mumbling more incoherently and made a vague gesture toward the stairs.  Alia laughed in her lyrical voice at the mention of hippy chick and thanked him for the info.  She looked around at the scene, enjoying the throbbing rhythms.<br>
  Out of the corner of her eye she noticed a girl sitting in a corner, rocking herself, obviously distraught.  &quot;Damn,&quot; Alia muttered as she danced her way through the crowd to the girl and crouched down next to her, smiling reassuringly.  &quot;Hey, what's wrong?&quot;  The girl began muttering about changing faces and weird stalkers.  <br>
  &quot;Bad trip, eh?  It'll be okay.&quot;  Alia began smoothing the hair back from the girl's brow, willing the blood under her fingers to obey her Will.  In her mind she could see the drug coursing through the blood and willed it to separate, to begin moving toward her bladder, to be washed out of her system.  Sober, the girl relaxed, the logical part of her mind telling her it was just an hallucination. That complete, she told the girl to be more careful of her drug sources and to make certain she was in a safe place next time she wants to trip.<br>
  Heading back toward the stairs, dodging sweating hands and reeling dancers, Alia was looking forward to watching Star Wars.  She hadn't seen it in a few years and it would be interesting to see the reaction of vampires who had never seen it at all.<br>
  Arriving in Boomer's room, Alia chuckled to see Mr. Crowley sitting so stiffly on the couch, still picturing him rolling down a hill in a garbage can as she had heard had happened.  She was a bit concerned to see Boomer in a state of near catatonia with Crowley present.  She knew him to be a busy-body of the worst sort and figured he was probably racking up excellent gossip about Boomer's 'hospitality'.  'Oh well, I can't help people if they don't want it,' she thought and took a seat on the floor near the Herald, flashing him a smile before becoming engrossed in the movie.  <br>

I'll assume Vicious stopped by before he left.<br>
<br>
Vicious was about to kick the door open when he remembered that this wasn't his apartment. As such, he put down the unconscious girl he was carrying and opened the door about an inch. Then he picked the girl back up and gave the door a good kick, stomping hard as his foot came down. A few people observed this, but didn't really seem to care. Vicious tossed the girl onto the ground and looked around. Some idiot sitting next to the door stared directly at him.<br>
<br>
"Man, you....that.... fucking.... straight.... edge...." the man muttered. He looked tired and bored. Vicious delivered upon him a swift kick to the chest, knocking him backwards and causing him to slide a bit before coming to a rest and falling over. Vicious turned and glared at the individual members of the room until he spotted Crowley, looking extremely uncomfortable in his surroundings. Vicious walked over and sat on the couch next to him, putting his legs up on the table and pulling out a cigarette.<br>
<br>
"You doin' okay, Crowley?"<br>
<br>
((OOC: The contents of this conversation will be revealed later, as it leads into a certain situation that will be covered later that's currently being worked on.))<br>
<br>
Following his talk with Crowley, Vicious gave him a friendly pat on the back, stood up, pulled out his baton lifted it for all to see and jumped on the table.<br>
<br>
"OKAY, ANYONE <I>ELSE</I> WHO THINKS IT'D BE FUN AND ENTERTAINING TO FUCK WITH CROWLEY WILL QUICKLY LEARN WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE SIX FEET OF TITANIUM ALLOY FORCIBLY INSERTED INTO THEIR INTESTINAL TRACT!"<br>
<br>
Vicious turned, gave Crowley an approving smile, and sauntered up the stairs, cigarette burning a few unfortunate mortals along the way, because damnit, that's what Vicious does. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shiningflower7>shiningflower7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FF9300>(6/3/03 11:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> (OCC  You know that doesn't make any sence.  We were upstairs watching star wars.  It could have happened ealier that night while we were downstairs, anyway my responce)<br>
<br>
  Sara glazed around the room. She had seen star wars before.  She picked up her glass that Mitch and given to her and whispered something to Steven.  &quot;Steven, I want to go back down stairs and dance.  Do you think that will be ok?&quot;  Steven looked over at Boomer who didn't seem to have a clue what the movie was about any way, then he looked Alia, who had just walked in. Then Steven notices the hearald and says, &quot;I dance with you.&quot;<br>
  Steven and Sara move to the door.  Sara notices how every one looks at Steven.  They eye him w/ cynisism.  She feels safe with Steven there but at the same time feels as if all these kinderd think less of him. Somehow she shakes the feeling and they walk downstairs.  Downstairs, Steven and Sara pick a place that has some room. It is crowded and they get pressed againt each other more than once.  Sara could feel that Steven hasn't fed tonight.  She could see his hunger coming out.  It didn't scare her.  She had watched Willard feed many times and then she would dispose of the corpse.  These nameless people were sheep, she knew.  Then all of the sudden there was noice at the door and Sara saw the stoner that was sitting in the front door fly on his back.  And there stood Visious (occ forgive me I don't really know what you look like)she felt his hatred ozzing from his body.  Steven stepped up to talk to him and Sara shruck back.  In the mist of all this, Sara felt the same eyes on her as she had earlier that evening.  The mysterious man that she thought she had talked to in LA.  The man that she dreamed about.  Never had another man entered her mind before.  It disturbed her.  She looked around and then all of the sudden she felt breath on her neck.  She heard him say, &quot;Sara.&quot;  She turned and saw him again.  <br>
  &quot;You have been following me.&quot;  She said calmly.  She couldn't tell if he was kindred or not there was mystery shrouded around him.  <br>
  &quot;What gives you that impression?&quot;  He said back with a coy voice.<br>
  &quot;You are here, you was in LA.  Who are you?&quot; <br>
  &quot;You know me. Sara, I have been looking for you for 50 years.  I have had my eyes on you in New York.  Your past has come to claim you.&quot;<br>
  &quot;No, I am Willard's I will not leave him.  I love him.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;Do you?&quot; His brows twisted upward and visions of Willard's face as it was before he was turned and then after it was turned.  Sara started to cry.  Steven was so involved w/ Visious that he missed this.  Sara knew that if Steven was here that he would not have let this thing talk to her like this. But he wasn't talking.  It was the images....  The next thing she saw was her in bed with Willard they were naked and entwined.  After they had seperated. Willard went to another woman who was also naked.  He pierced her skin with his fangs and drained her until she was nearly dead.  Then, he pierced his own skin, and fed her.  'This isn't real,' Sara's mind knew it wasn't.  But jealousy came over her.  &quot;Stop.&quot; She cried and the man's hand brushed her hair.<br>
  &quot;Sara, I will come again.  I will claim you.  You will be mine.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I will not.  I am Willard's.  I will always be. I am going to tell him about you and then you will have to deal with the laws of this land.  Leave me be.&quot;  His laugh was so soft that she barely heard it, but it rang in her head.<br>
  Next thing she knew she was crouched down crying. Steven, finally done with his business with Vicious, stepped over and picked her up.  &quot;Are you okay?&quot;  Sara was crying so bad that she couldn't answer.  &quot;Here Sara, let me take you home.&quot;  Steven picked her up and took her through the crowded room.  Willard was due back any day now. Steven hoped that he would hurry. Steven, knew that where ever Willard went it must have been urgant and very dangerous to leave his retianer behind.  Steven looked at Sara who had calmed to a soft wimper as he set her in the back of the black BMW car.  her skin stuck to the leather seat as he gently pushed her to lay down. Steven thought to himself that three weeks without Willard's blood was the cuase of her current state.  He was unaware of the vampire that haunted her dreams or the most resent encounter with this mysterious man.  He got into the driver's side of the car and drove Sara to her house.  By the time they had got there Sara had calmed down enough to sit up and talk a little.  She did not mention the meeting and every time she thought about it the image of Willard embracing another woman came to her mind.  She started crying agian.  Steven walked her up to her bedroom and tucked her in.  &quot;Willard will be home soon.  Don't you worry.&quot;  Steven wispered as he pulled the blankets over her body.  Then he sat in a victorian styled chair that was placed next to an amoir and watched her sleep until the early part of morning.  He sat and thought about his loniliness and what it would be like to be loved again.  But those visions were all past for him.  His hunger for blood was too much when he finally left. Sara had stopped tossing and looked like a goddess as the calm sleep fell over her.  He must feed and so he went to the car and back to the party.  There were still a few people who were so drugged up they couldn't move but some had just crashed.  He picked up a random body from the sleeping many and took it to his car.  He drove until he got to Moss Landing. Then he fed and disposed of the body in a most descreat manner.  It looked as if she had overdosed on the beach.  A nice little suicide.  Steven smiled at the art of it.  But it would be nice to have some one to walk with him and enjoy this with.  Sometimes even Steven thought about breaking the masquerade.<br>

Crowley wouldn't have fed quite like that. Crowley's a Ventrue and Ventrue have feeding preferences, so it wouldn't really work that he'd collect someone at random. He'd need to find out if they fit his needs first. Also, Crowley wouldn't kill someone he fed off of unless it was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>absolutely neccessary</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. The city has a long history of Kindred just leaving their dead bodies around, or just of people dissapearing, and that sort of thing tends to attract hunters and Sabbat like flies to honey. Crowley is paranoid about that sort of thing, so he's pretty damned careful. Being able to erase memories of Kine you feed off of is NICE. <br>
<br>
No worries; just letting you know it couldn't have worked quite this way. If you need help please feel free to email me at mcrupp@ucsc.edu. <br>
