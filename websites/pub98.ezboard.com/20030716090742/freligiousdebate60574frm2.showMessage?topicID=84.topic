<br>
<br>
&quot;Kent is also infuriated by the US position on Israel - a nation that both has nuclear weapons and has attacked another country, he says.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh, first of all there is no proof that Israel has nukes.  Second, they have never attacked another country.  This claim is simply false.<br>
<br>
As for the chosen people comment, that is his opinion about what he thinks Bush might think.  Granted, Bush thinks he is pretty special, but I don't recall him referring to the US as the &quot;chosen people&quot;.  As for Jews being referred to as the &quot;chosen people&quot;, that is misconstrued by just about everyone.  &quot;Chosen&quot; just refers to the group who was chosen for the path of the Torah, and it has nothing to do with superiority.  The superiority complex that goes along with this has been made up by people who don't like the Jews, not the Jews themselves.  <br>
<br>
Sorry, I just had to clear those things up.  I get nervous when people make false claims like that because it causes trouble for innocent people.  For the most part, I agree with a lot of what this guy said.  Shrub is like a little kid who was left alone with daddy's Corvette, and he is definitely a fundie.  He may think of himself and this country as &quot;chosen&quot;, but not in the same aspect as the religious Jews.  His is definitely a superiority complex, and in the two years he has been in office he has created way too many enemies around the world.  I wasn't thrilled to have voted for Gore/Lieberman, but I am damn glad I didn't vote for W.  The guy is out of control, and I hope he gets the boot in 2004.<br>

There is no proof that Israel has nukes, but there is definitely a lot of speculation.  I don't deny that they have them, but there is still no proof that they have them.  The reason why I took issue with the man being quoted in the article is because he wasn't saying &quot;I think Israel has them&quot;, instead he was suggesting that Bush should snub them because they do have them.  That is a lofty accusation with no proof.  I wouldn't blame them for having nukes due to the fact that their sovereignty is at risk everyday, but I'm in agreement with the rest of the people here that no country should have them, not even the US.  I'm not as worried about Israel having them due to being a civilzed democracy, but as Bush is showing us, even a civilized democracy can get a little out of hand.  I wouldn't lose sleep over Israel having nukes, but I would lose sleep over someplace like Iraq having them.  It is wrong in both situations, but one situation is a little scarier than the other.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I think that is a question of interpretation. Some say invaded, some say it's &quot;defense&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't personally feel there is much to interpret here.  I'm guessing he is referring to the 1967 war.  In that situation 4 countries surrounded the border and publicly announced the attack on the radio stations throughout the Middle East.  They were cocky about it because they thought there was no way they could lose.  Israel didn't wipe out Egypts air force by going into Egypt and finding all the planes.  They wiped out the air force because the air force was right there ready to attack.  Israel would have been completely stupid not to take the first shot.  However, everyone was in place already, and there was absolutely no question over whether they were going to be attacked.  If you tell me that you are going to kill me, then you go around town telling everyone that you are going to come to my house on a certain day to kill me, then you step onto my front lawn with a gun, well, I'm not going to wait for you to take the first shot.  I'm going to do something to protect my family.  If I was to turn around and shoot you as you were coming towards me with your weapon, then I don't think people would accuse me of being the aggressor.  For some reason there is a double standard where Israel is concerned.  I disagree with a lot of their tactics, but I don't see a whole lot of interpretation surrounding the 1967 war.  Besides, they have already turned over more than 90% of the land they seized during that war in exchange for peace with Egypt.  They had even built on this land already.  If they were just interested in taking land, then the Sinai would still belong to Israel.  Instead, they gave it back and just said &quot;here is your land, leave us alone now&quot;.  All they want is to be left alone.<br>

Sounds like Iraq.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not as worried about Israel having them due to being a civilzed democracy&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm worried because they seem to have no hesitation in using heavy artillery (helicopter gunships, guided missles, etc.) in civilian areas.  They are targeting one or two alleged terrorists, but take out double or triple (or more) that amount in so-called &quot;collateral damage&quot;.  If they were able to design a nuclear weapon that could guarantee the safety of greater Israel, do you think they would hesitate to use it?  I don't.  What frightens me is those most likely to act this way are the people who keep getting elected to high office there.. I understand the Israeli people are desperate, but this, in my opinion, is not the way a &quot;civilized democracy&quot; should operate.  Recently they've begun demolishing Palestinian stores and shops that they say did not have &quot;proper permits&quot; to be there.. I think that's an excuse.  I think many of the policies are there simply to try and break the spirit of the Palestinians, and I think that's wrong and it's going to backfire.<br>

<br>
This is one area where I agree with you.  I understand that Israel is always the guinea pig when it comes to dealing with the war on terror, and therefore more likely to make the mistakes that come under scrutiny, but I don't agree with bombing areas that have the potential to house innocent children.  I was appalled when they killed the Hamas leader in that apartment and took out 14 children with him.  Israelis were appalled as well.  It isn't like taking out this one leader had the potential to save lives because there was another one to rise up and take his place.  Meanwhile, more innocent children died as a result.  I understand that they would be prone to making the most mistakes, but I do feel that some situations are just common sense.<br>
<br>
&quot;If they were able to design a nuclear weapon that could guarantee the safety of greater Israel, do you think they would hesitate to use it? I don't.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, they would hesitate to use it.  That doesn't mean they won't use it, but keep in mind that this nation is a democracy that has to answer to voters and the international community.  Contrary to belief throughout the Arab world, Israelis are not monsters.  Many of them protest Israel's actions as it is, and many of them go out of their way to stand up for the rights of the Palestinians.  If Israel just wanted to wipe out the Palestinians, then it would have been done a long time ago.  They have the means to do it, and definitely have the excuse in place.  If they could defeat 4 countries in 1967, who were backed at the time by the second most powerful nation in the world(Russia), then they could definitely wipe out the people in these territories that don't have their own military, and who only have the backing of nations that Israel has defeated before.  <br>
<br>
&quot;What frightens me is those most likely to act this way are the people who keep getting elected to high office there.. I understand the Israeli people are desperate, but this, in my opinion, is not the way a &quot;civilized democracy&quot; should operate.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not crazy about Sharon either, but let's put ourselves in Israel's place for a moment.  If we had either a successful or attempted 9/11 every single day, then we would be desperate.  If we thought that someone like Pat Buchanan had a never before used tactic that might protect us, then in our desperation we would end up electing him.  We have the luxury of looking at 9/11 as a moment in our lives instead of a way of life, and therefore we can be more critical.  If it was your child having to attend a kindergarten with an armed guard outside the door, then you just might be desperate enough to vote someone in who you think would protect your child at all costs.  Is voting for Sharon the rational answer?  No.  But these voters don't share his sentiments, just the desperation.  Looking at it from the outside, I think the rational answer would be to vote in someone who followed in Rabin's footsteps.<br>
<br>
&quot;Recently they've begun demolishing Palestinian stores and shops that they say did not have &quot;proper permits&quot; to be there.. I think that's an excuse. I think many of the policies are there simply to try and break the spirit of the Palestinians, and I think that's wrong and it's going to backfire.&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree with you that it is wrong to demolish Palestinian property like this, but it isn't being done to &quot;break the spirit of the Palestinians&quot;.  It is an irrational act of desperation to try and deter the terrorists from continuing with their actions.  If someone thinks they are going to be rewarded in the afterlife by blowing up Israeli civilians, then they aren't going to hesitate to do it.  However, if they think their family will suffer by losing their home or business, then they might think twice.  I don't agree with this tactic, and it is a prime example of how the ends don't justify the means.  However, it is not being done to merely break anyone's spirit.  People don't think of Palestinians as having &quot;spirit&quot; because the majority of the community supports terrorist activity, and when the terrorist succeeds, they throw a party.  When a Jewish terrorist gets caught trying to blow up Palestinians, then Israel doesn't throw a parade and call them a martyr, they lock the person's butt in jail and throw away the key.  This also applies to soldiers who overstep their bounds and take their actions to a personal level.  Israel already tried to boost the &quot;spirit&quot; of the Palestinians by building them 4 universities and providing them with modern amenities like utilities.  As of 1967 the vast majority of Palestinians living in the territories didn't even have utilities.  Jordan and Egypt left these people hanging out to dry.  For many of them, they wouldn't have homes or businesses to lose if it wasn't for the Israelis.  This doesn't make it right for Israel to turn around and take these things away, but if Israel was really trying to break their spirit, then they would be living in worse conditions than they were under Jordan and Egypt, if that is possible.  If the Palestinians would cease the terror activity, then they could be living free just like the Arabs within the Israel borders.  If acts of terror are considered &quot;spirit&quot;, then I suppose I don't want them to have &quot;spirit&quot; either.  <br>

<br>
The voters, yes.. the international community, I think that except for the US they could care less what the International community thinks.  There have been countless calls from the international community on various issues, and they are usually ignored.  I'm not saying they don't have the right to do that, I just think your comment is misleading.<br>
<br>
&quot;People don't think of Palestinians as having &quot;spirit&quot; because the majority of the community supports terrorist activity, and when the terrorist succeeds, they throw a party. When a Jewish terrorist gets caught trying to blow up Palestinians, then Israel doesn't throw a parade and call them a martyr, they lock the person's butt in jail and throw away the key. This also applies to soldiers who overstep their bounds and take their actions to a personal level.&quot;<br>
<br>
When I talk about spirit, I mean the will to survive, to have a life for their families, to have freedom and independence.  When a terrorist activity happens, I don't think most of them enjoy the terrorist part, but celebrate the activity part.  As with the Israelis, they are just happy somebody is doing something.. but I think the realization of what this means on a human level will come back to haunt them.  If you read some of the accounts, I believe most of this &quot;terrorism party&quot; stuff is perpetrated by the Suicide Brigade itself.  The general theme I've come across is that the families don't even know their kids are involved, until a bombing happens and they come home to find members from the Suicide Brigade there setting up a party... I think a lot of this is built up by this extremist group, and the people feel hopelessly caught up in it (kind of like Hitler, huh?).<br>
<br>
..and I also don't believe it's entirely accurate that Israelis are so circumspect about their own terrorists, the grave of the settler in Hebron comes to mind.. I think they still have annual pilgrimmages to his gravesite etc. etc.  I've also read many accounts of atrocities by soldiers, and the line is always &quot;well, it was unavoidable&quot; for one reason or another, or &quot;we're looking into that&quot; but you never here about it again, or &quot;we thought there was a terrorist there so we looted the house&quot;, that kind of thing.  I'm not saying the PA is any better (it's probably a lot worse), but I don't think they are on an equal par as to what they can do, the level of control they have, or the level of international recognition.  If you're going to call yourself a civilized democracy, I think you have a lot more to live up to.<br>
<br>
&quot;If the Palestinians would cease the terror activity, then they could be living free just like the Arabs within the Israel borders.&quot;<br>
<br>
How &quot;free&quot; are they really?  How are they regarded inside Israel, as beloved members of society or second-class citizens?<br>
<br>
I think this is one of the worst situations in the world, and I for one can't come up with any kind of reasonable solution.  I wish some university somewhere would have a contest for ideas to end the conflict, and maybe we'd get some fresh ideas.. it seems we keep hashing out the same old, tired, ideas over and over again, that have never worked and never will work.<br>
<br>
And on that depressing note, lol... <br>

<br>
It isn't that they don't care what the international community thinks.  Israel has diplomatic relations with most non-Arab nations.  The problem is that when another nation makes a recommendation to Israel, it isn't in Israel's best interest.  European nations are afraid of the Arab nations because of the terrorism and the oil.  US has the ability to strong-arm the Arab nations, but other places don't.  Israel is the only nation that is told to &quot;show restraint&quot; when they are attacked.  No other nation in the world would be asked to do such a thing.  This is why Israel sometimes needs to do what they feel is necessary despite what others have to say.  If they decided to &quot;show restraint&quot;, then they would be obliterated.  However, Israel doesn't just blow off the international community either.  Nuking their neighbors would definitely be crossing the line, and Israel knows that.  They have been accused of a lot of things, but stupidity isn't one of them.  They are just in a predicament where they have to walk a fine line between diplomatic relations and protecting their citizens.  They also realize that there are those in the international community that help them, and they can't afford to lose that.  For instance, Germany is providing them with a missile defense system in order to protect themselves from Iraq if the US invades.  Great Britain also provides them with a lot of military equipment.  If they piss off the US and Europe by breaking out the nukes, then they have way too much to lose.  As supportive as America is of Israel, most citizens wouldn't stand for Israel starting a nuclear war.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If you're going to call yourself a civilized democracy, I think you have a lot more to live up to.&quot;<br>
<br>
One can say the same thing about any civilized democracy.  US soldiers have done some terrible things as well, but nobody questions our civilized or democratic status.  Israeli soldiers do some bad things while following orders, but if a soldier oversteps those bounds and starts going outside their duties, then that soldier usually gets thrown in jail.  There are also many things soldiers get accused of, and then it comes out later that it wasn't true.  That isn't true in all cases, but it happens quite a bit during the &quot;smear Israel&quot; campaigns.  Some of these accusations are from the same sources that claim Jews sacrifice Christians and Muslims to drink their blood, which BTW is specifically prohibited by Jewish law.  <br>
<br>
&quot;How &quot;free&quot; are they really? How are they regarded inside Israel, as beloved members of society or second-class citizens?&quot;<br>
<br>
First of all, they are freer in Israel than any other place in the Arab world.  Each Arab individual has the right to vote, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, ability for all citizens to get an education, career choices for both men and women, etc.  Second, they are considered equal members of society by many.  I know they have the same problems there that minorities in most countries have.  I think that is human nature.  However, Arabs have the same opportunities as the Jews, Arabs are elected to the Knesset and many Arabs and Jews intermingle.  An Arab and a Jewish family being friends in Israel isn't anymore unusual than a black family and a whilte family being friends in the US.  The reason why it is so important to keep the Jewish majority is because the whole concept behind the creation of Israel was to guarantee Jewish people a safe haven.  If they lose the Jewish majority, then the Jews are back to square one with persecution, slaughter and exile.  This isn't to hurt the Arab, but to save the Jew.  The government also tries to be inclusive of Arabs.  They recently put up bilingual signs throughout Tel Aviv so the Arab population could get around easier.  Their voice is being heard, but like any other minority, there are various issues that come about.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I think this is one of the worst situations in the world, and I for one can't come up with any kind of reasonable solution. I wish some university somewhere would have a contest for ideas to end the conflict, and maybe we'd get some fresh ideas.. it seems we keep hashing out the same old, tired, ideas over and over again, that have never worked and never will work.&quot;<br>
<br>
I soooo agree with you.  I sometimes wonder if this perpetual cycle of violence will ever end.  I personally think that a two state solution is a good idea, but that the PA needs serious reforms first, and there needs to be some sort of guarantee for Israel's safety.  Jordan and Egypt have managed to achieve peace with Israel, eventhough I wouldn't call everyone friends.  That gives me some hope for settling the conflict.  I don't see it being settled anytime too soon though.  Sharon and Arafat are both too dangerous, and they have too many little personal games going.  Hey, they should put you and me in charge.  We can respectfully debate without hating and killing eachother, lol.  Its too bad Einstein had to turn down the Israeli presidency when it was offered.  Maybe he would have thought of something back then.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br>

I may be the only person in the world, but I don't think a two-state solution will work.  There's too much disparity between the two sides.  You'll end up with this really advanced country on one side, and a really backward and poor one on the other, and nobody will be safe.<br>
<br>
They were talking about this yet again on NPR yesterday.. the expert o' the day was basically saying the whole issue boils down to &quot;settlements and safety&quot;.. I think this is too simplistic.  I'm shaking my head as I'm sitting here, because it is just not going to be so easy -- &quot;here, we're leaving the settlements&quot; and &quot;here, we won't attack you anymore&quot; and they all lived happily ever after.. Yeah right..  I kind of liked the idea of making all the Palestinians Israeli citizens <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but I know that will never fly either.<br>

I thought that all pro-Palestinians were for a 2 state solution, either that or just a Palestinian state with dead Jews floating in the sea.  No, I don't think you fall under the latter category.  You do make a valid point about the problems with the 2 state solution, and the Middle East is already a prime example of that right now.  There are terrible conditions over there, and then Israel is sitting right in the middle with all their progress and advancements.  I believe that this is one big reason why so many people hate Israel over there.  They don't realize that if those countries gave their citizens the freedoms that the US and Israel give their citizens, then they would see a lot of progress as well.  NASA just sent an Israeli astronaut into space this week while citizens of Arab countries can't even vote.  I guess this all boils back down to those reforms we had talked about in the past.  <br>
<br>
As for making the Pals Israeli citizens, I believe you are right.  That isn't going to fly with either side.  Israel can't risk losing a Jewish majority because of the fact they are a democracy.  If the majority are Arab/Palestinian, then they will vote in Arab/Palestinian leaders.  Once that happens, they run the risk of the country being transformed into a nation that is just like the other nations in the Middle East.  Not only do the citizens in general lose their freedoms as a result, but the Jewish citizens wouldn't be safe.  They would either be exiled like they were in other Muslim countries, or they would be executed.  At least this is the risk that is run if the Jews lose their majority.  As for the Palestinian side, I don't think they would be too keen on becoming Israeli citizens.  They already had the option of living under Israeli rule in the territories, and they don't like that option.  Making them citizens would bring them back to square one.  The only thing that will help is to end the cycle of violence, but both sides have differing opinions on who needs to take the first step on that.  I personally feel that the violence started with the Pals, and that they need to take the first step to end it.  I feel that if Israel just withdraws all troops, then the Pals will just escalate the violence because nobody would stop them.  I'm sure you feel just the opposite as me, but I could be wrong about that too.  I just hope it doesn't get worse before it gets better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=84.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=84.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=84.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.threadControl?topicID=84.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=84.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=84.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="religiousdebate60574frm2">Debate Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm10">Christianity Discussions (G Rated)<option value="religiousdebate60574frm1">Announcements<option value="religiousdebate60574frm11">Test Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm5">Help Files</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574>religiousdebate</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2>Debate Forum</a> <font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
