 Rick thank you for bringing your knowledge to this board.  Your info is extremely informative to me.  The invert community would greatly expand with the amount of gravel covered  thus providing overtly more food for the food chain.  Ie:  more crayfish,sculpin,and minnows that the larger fish as well as the smaller fish can feed on.  HHMMMMmmmmm kind of like a geometric progression of the food chain eh Rick?  Inverted!!???<br>
<br>
Is my thinking right on this Rick?  Can do nothing but good for the fish and the benthic.  (did I use this term correctly)?<br>
<br>
John I doubt an extra 10 inches of water will allow boat traffic to navigate up through the state park as most of that water flows through the gravel as opposed to over it.   Tried to navigate down it on saturday and the main channel to get up and down it has changed considerably.  Impossible to go down without getting out and pushing a boat.  Did not used to be that way.   I figure that an ex-tra 10 inches of water would only actually cover 4 or5  inches of water over the gravel and it would take a channel of at least 10 inches to navigate up to the C&amp;R area so I figure you are safe from the hordes of bait fishers and boaters.  Jet boats would be a different story. (more on motors and size limits at another time) <br>
<br>
Dano and X-tra 10 inches of water year-round would move the fish in different ways.  It would only confuse the fisherman for a short period of time.  it would not take you long to figure it out.  It would however cover a little more gravel and allow for more spawning area over existing areas trout use to spawn in.  In a lot of areas you would not have to walk as far to get to the fish. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Rick...Your Lumnology explanation I think I got.  <br>
It explains why the water flow from the dam is actually warmer at this time of year and probably explains a good bit of why a shad kill happens. (especially in the winter)  We are still a little confused as to why we get a minor one in the late summer.  Perhaps you have more info on this one as well?<br>
<br>
My question Rick is when fisherman talk about a lake turning over how does that actually happen..  I do notice that there is an event on the river Ie:  the water in the river takes on a STAINED look to it.  During generation it is much more evident.  The clairty appears like a weak version of hot tea.  This seems to happen every year and this year happened during the later days of nov and through december....  There has to be some physics involved here in a big way. Tannin perhaps?  Ie: leaves staining the water or does the metalimnion hold such particles and gravity and heat take such particles towards the bottom.     As you can see; am searching for an answer on this one.    <br>
<br>
Thanks Rick.   <br>

<br>
There are many places that we fish where 10 inches might as well be 40 feet. Not to exagerate the issue but crossing to the island at Rim Shoal is a tough wade for me with 6-8 inches of additional water. For 90% of amature fly fishers it would be something that would not even be attempted. An additional 10 inches of water would effectively remove 75% of the wadeable / fishable water in one of the best C&amp;R areas in of the river.<br>
<br>
The issues of minimum flow are very complex. I have to agree that they would definately increase habitat. Bigger water would easily equal more habitat. The water temps we had in the previous years are not acceptable. But as a wade fisher I don't want to throw out the baby with the bath water.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the previous exaggeration.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yeah 10 inches would probably make wading a little more difficult crossing the river to the 1st Island.  I would be like some extra tail water that would not fall out for the return trip.    This is an issue that has been around awhile and seems to crop up only when there is drought conditions.  Yea the summer and fall are problems and it would be nice to see some extra water at those times and during the spawn.<br>
<br>
Min flow is an issue that has galvanized all groups concerned with the river.  But we either have min flow or not (I don't think we will see it for in the near future) and if the infrastructure is put in place to achieve it I think it would be hard to micro manage it after the fact.<br>
<br>
Remember it does take an act of congress and the presidents signiture to change the mandate.  Oh if we only knew then what we know now or even 100 years from now.  <br>
<br>
I do agree that O'2 is a bigger problem but the momentum behind min flow is much greater.  <br>
<br>
A weir dam has got to be cheaper and politically easier to deal with as hopefully it would leave SWPA out of the equation.  I don't think it would affect the lumnology but would greatly affect the benthic by adding O'2 for all the little creatures.  We might loose a little C&amp;R area though depending on where would be the best place to put the Dam thing.  There are test holes that were drilled 7 or 8 years ago.  My guess would be where the old bridge use to cross.  You can still see some of the concrete on the left bank (Baxter co side) about 100 yards or so upstream of the access.  We'd loose a few hundred yards of C&amp;R area if my guess is right.  It may not even be feasable but we all agree that something has to be done.  <br>
<br>
If however we do get 6to10 inches of extra water via min flow I don't guess you'll be wading to the first island.  I don't think that would be a legit argument to make to the corps or the SWPA that would get any traction.  <br>

<br>
Don't get me wrong I am completely for more water when the conditions call for it. The difference here is that 10 inches of water all year would be a considerable change for those of us that are wade fishermen. For a boat fisher I am sure it is a win/win so to speak. We can't have summers like we had 3 years ago. But I'd hate to be locked out of wadable sections also. It would certianly change our ability to sight fish as well.<br>

I may not have stated the tradeoff question very clearly in my last post.  I think that, with respect to minimum flows, the important tradeoff for you to consider is, which do you want to benefit the most from minimum flows, the standing crop of trout or ideal fishing conditions?  Ecologically, the native fishery is gone.  We are now dealing with the management of exotic species.  If we were going to talk about true &quot;ecological&quot; issues, we would be discussing how to manage minimum flows to most benefit native species.  I don't think that's that is going to show up as a realistic issue on the radar screen.  So, we are back to the tradoff between minimum flows to benefit the standing crop of trout vs. minimum flows to benefit wade fishermen.  In my mind, a solution designed for either output is fine, it is just a matter of whether you wish to maximize the benefit to either one, or meet in the middle.  AGFC and the trout fishing population in general probably (I'm guessing) want to maximize the standing crop, wheras fly fishing gurus probably are not that interested in maximizing standing crop.  Why should you be?  You aren't keeping the fish (and removing the biomass) anyway!  You want the best fishing conditions for the greatest amount of time, while keeping the trout population from being decimated from the low O2 concentrations that we discussed earlier.  The moderator's humble suggestion is to use your energy to keep the political discussion framed in these terms.  If you can pull that off, you can probably work a pretty good compromise.  If anyone insists on making fish ecology an issue, let me know, and I'll bring channel catfish and a host of other warm water species into the debate.  You will look so moderate by comparison that they will probably be happy to negotiate with you.  -- Rick  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyflinger82>flyflinger82</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#000000>(2/24/03 6:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Low disolved oxygen levels</span><hr size=1> Rick-<br>

Being a former biology major, I have a pretty good understanding of DO levels from some of the classes I have taken.  Is there a simple test that I could do streamside to determine the O2 content in the water?  Is this a very complicated test that requires special tools or chemicals and lots of complex calcuations?  I fish the White below Beaver and these things are not often mentioned so I was just curious if there is a simple test for this.  Thank you for all of the info you provide to the site!<br>

The sample was sealed and then heated on a bunson burner for a period of time. I can't remember the additive but it basically absorbed all of the available oxygen in the sample. From there we weighed out the results. I'm not sure if there is a simple test like a PH test or not. <br>
<br>
Another issue with the DO levels is the additional gasses that are dissolved in solution. Since this water is under several atmospheres of pressure under the dam some of these gasses will be immediately given off as soon as they pressure is released as it comes through the turbines. Some other gasses like the sulpher gasses will take some additional agitation before they can be released. The issue with the additional gasses is that they take up available space that could be taken by O2. <br>
<br>
I'm sure Rick has forgotten more about this than I'll ever know, but what I know about the process is that it is a little more complicated than a simple sample.<br>

Found myself wondering whether Cabelas had anything like this or not, as I generally like dealing with them. They do, though I can't tell if it's the same unit or not. Cabelas' description at least implies that there's a little more documentation included with theirs, and it's also a couple bucks cheaper.<br>

DO meters were the rage about fifteen years ago for big time bass fisherman. There popularity seems to have declined.  I was suprised that BPS still sold them.  They do seem to have advanced the technology.  Most of the units are rigged to go in a boat.<br>

Jimmy, to respond to your question about why lakes turn over (another post that I couldn't see until now).  In my earlier post about stratification, I explained that during the summer, the lake is cold at the bottom (4 degrees C), and warm at the top.  During a true winter stratification, it is warm at the bottom (4 degrees C), and cold at the top (0 degrees C).  This is all due to the maximum density of water being at 4 degrees C (let me know if you're curious why, it's simple, but pretty interesting).  Temperate (mid-latitude) lakes typically turn over in the fall and spring.  Let's take the fall turnover.  As the weather begins to cool, and days become shorter (less radiation), the warm waters at the top (epilimnion) of the stratified lake begin to cool.  When it cools down to the same temperature (density) as the hypolimnion, then a little wind will cause the entire lake water to mix (if it's a big wind, the turnover can be pretty dramatic).  Fall turnover is often accompanied by the lake changing color when the water from the bottom is brought to the top.  My limnology book is at work, so for now well just say that the discoloration is caused by chemical magic that takes place in the hypolimnion during the summer.  I have also heard of strong odors associated with rapid fall turnovers.  A spring turnover is the same thing in reverse, the water at the top warms until it is 4 degrees C, and a little wind mixes it again.  It has to be pretty cold to get true winter stratification, so I doubt that you get it here.  So, there may not a be a true spring turnover in most Arkansas lakes (unless they freeze).  -- Rick  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyfishar>FlyFishAR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#000000>(3/3/03 9:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://boards.justflies.com/Images/4/4551Photo1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm back! - lake turnovers.  </span><hr size=1> Rick:<br>

On occasion the EZ Board people run some sort of &quot;beta test&quot;. When they do it signs everyone out of their log-in. You probably just need to re log-in and everything will be back to normal. Or at least as &quot;normal&quot; as it can get with you that is. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
