And I agree that he should not have made that general statement about these 7 (though 2 of them were Christians)...I have this same dilemma with my mother right now, constantly saying that my step-dad is in heaven now, when I can't say that I believe that myself...but it's a comfort to her, so I let her believe it, but I don't confirm or agree with her on it. She's comforted in thinking that he's living on, and not just ceased to exist. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Live your life so the preacher won't have to lie at your funeral.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/3/03 9:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=99.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re:  Re: Bush</span><hr size=1> Candy--first of all thanks for replying. I don't think emotion was the problem. Yes, we think we are worm food when we die, but if you have read those threads have you not read about our secular funeral ceremonies and speeches at wakes etc.?? There have been just as many of those discussions--sort of like alternatives to baptism...many new A/A don't know what to do. You knew better but like many xians think we are incapable of providing comfort.<br>
<br>
As for keeping things quiet to avoid hurting feelings. Wish my JW MIL was more like that, but then again I want fundie theology right out there in the open where we can all see it for what it is and how intolerant and divisive it is, so maybe Bush being so open will help more folks realize the terrible danger he and men like Ashcroft pose to our nation. <br>

While the it is still religious, the most memorable line can at least cross through different religions and is still a lovely sentiment: &quot;We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God.' &quot; (January 28, 1986)  THe rest of the speech was better as well. <br>

<br>
If you lurk at our board at all, you know that we would never tell someone in mourning that their beloved is worm food. That's not how it works.<br>
<br>
It's just that we grieve with the absence of a belief that everything is all right on the other side, and that there's something more. It's loss without a net.<br>
<br>
That's a big difference, in my opinion, from pretending that &quot;they're not gone, they're just sleeping&quot;, or that the loved one is merely &quot;somewhere else&quot; away from those that love them.<br>

In a personal statement, Bush can say anything he wants.  However when he speaks <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>for</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the nation, then yes, I feel that SOCAS should be respected.  That his religious 'expression' is making its way into speeches on foreign policy etc. is unacceptable.

<br>

<br>
Read Reagan's speech from 1986 then Bush's from a couple of days ago...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ronald Reagan - 1986</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Ladies and Gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans. Today is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss. <br>
<br>
Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together. <br>
<br>
To the families of the seven: We cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, &quot;Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.&quot; They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us. We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers. <br>
<br>
And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them. <br>
<br>
I've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute. We'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue. I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: &quot;Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.&quot; <br>
<br>
There's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, &quot;He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.&quot; Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete. <br>
<br>
The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and &quot;slipped the surly bonds of Earth&quot; to &quot;touch the face of God.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bush - 2003</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, this day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country. At 9:00 a.m. this morning, Mission Control in Houston lost contact with our Space Shuttle Columbia. A short time later, debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas. The Columbia is lost; there are no survivors. <br>
<br>
On board was a crew of seven: Colonel Rick Husband; Lt. Colonel Michael Anderson; Commander Laurel Clark; Captain David Brown; Commander William McCool; Dr. Kalpana Chawla; and Ilan Ramon, a Colonel in the Israeli Air Force. These men and women assumed great risk in the service to all humanity. <br>
<br>
In an age when space flight has come to seem almost routine, it is easy to overlook the dangers of travel by rocket, and the difficulties of navigating the fierce outer atmosphere of the Earth. These astronauts knew the dangers, and they faced them willingly, knowing they had a high and noble purpose in life. Because of their courage and daring and idealism, we will miss them all the more. <br>
<br>
All Americans today are thinking, as well, of the families of these men and women who have been given this sudden shock and grief. You're not alone. Our entire nation grieves with you. And those you loved will always have the respect and gratitude of this country. <br>
<br>
The cause in which they died will continue. Mankind is led into the darkness beyond our world by the inspiration of discovery and the longing to understand. Our journey into space will go on. <br>
<br>
In the skies today we saw destruction and tragedy. Yet farther than we can see there is comfort and hope. In the words of the prophet Isaiah, &quot;Lift your eyes and look to the heavens. Who created all these? He who brings out the starry hosts one by one and calls them each by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.&quot; <br>
<br>
The same Creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today. The crew of the shuttle Columbia did not return safely to Earth; yet we can pray that all are safely home. <br>
<br>
May God bless the grieving families, and may God continue to bless America.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/3/03 2:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=99.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re: Re: Re: Bush</span><hr size=1> Candy – I am not trying to pick on you, but I think the mistake you are making is common among xians.  They feel that because the idea of taking comfort from some type of potential afterlife is so intrinsic to their worldview that they have no means of imagining life without it.  Your mother-in-law may wear a dress that she absolutely loves yet makes her look awful.  You may have the personal integrity to try and persuade her out of wearing it, but you’d never say, “Wow that dress shows off how fat you really are!  Did you swallow a beach ball?”  Not believing in god does not make us immediately insensitive, callous or cruel.  When my father died, I had to handle arrangements and deliver his eulogy and it was very difficult.  I dwelt upon his life and accomplishments, what the survivors had to carry on and the memories and love we all felt for him as well as the pain of his loss and how much we’d miss him.  I received many compliments including from the minister of his church.  I never once mentioned god or heaven.  We feel all the same feelings, we suffer all the same pains, god just doesn’t enter into it.  Just like a xian, when a loved one dies it hurts.  Just like a xian we face the rest of our lives without that person here.  Unlike a xian, we allow the full weight of that loss to be felt without deceiving ourselves into ‘something more’ after this life.  We do not try and diminish the meaning of their life, the significance of their loss or the tears that accompany it.<br>
<br>
I have no doubt that the reply though emotional was provoked out of not understanding how we can live like this.  I do not think it was vituperative or venomous, only shocked at how we could expect the world to behave any different than it is.  I do not want you to think you need to hide your feelings from us.  I have always had and continue to have the highest respect for you as a contributor and would not want that reduced because you felt you needed to hide something.<br>

I have to admit leading up to my step-dad's funeral after he was killed a few months ago, I had to wonder how my brother was going to handle the service.  (He's a minister in a very conservative church, unlike me, the pentecostal rebel!)  While we had no idea of Larry's final moments before his death, we both knew that he did not live the life of a Christian, nor did he ever profess to be.  So how would my brother conduct a funeral service that would comfort my mother and yet he could not lie about the very real possibility of where we (he and I) believed Larry to be...<br>
<br>
He spoke of Larry's character, the man that he was for the 13 years that we knew him.   More specifically my brother related his character to the Fruit of the Spirit in Galatians...I was impressed!  Most funerals I've been to have been all wishy-washy with false hopes given as to the eternal resting place of the deceased.  My brother chose to not touch on this aspect at all.<br>
<br>

But that's just the point:  why would Bush so fervently forward his own religious beliefs, when, as president of a nation of people with diverse beliefs, he *should* have been striving to touch everyone with his words, not just those who believe as he does?  No one is insisting he become a-religious;  but why must his speeches repeatedly alienate those tax-paying citizens who are not xian?  <br>

A total aside, but the lines he used at the end of his speech was from a poem written during WWII.  It was so appropriate for the speech...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In August or September 1941, Pilot Officer Magee composed High Flight and sent a copy to his parents. Several months later, on December 11, 1941 his Spitfire collided with another plane over England and Magee, only 19 years of age, crashed to his death.<br>
<br>
His remains are buried in the churchyard cemetery at Scopwick, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>
&quot;High Flight&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth<br>
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;<br>
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<br>
Of sun-split clouds - and done a hundred things<br>
You have not dreamed of - wheeled and soared and swung<br>
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,<br>
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung<br>
My eager craft through footless halls of air.<br>
Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue<br>
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace<br>
Where never lark, or even eagle flew -<br>
And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod<br>
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,<br>
Put out my hand and touched the face of God.<br>

I totally agree Jen.  I think Gaia can help shed some light on how people outside the US view this.  I know I've read several articles on BBC.com and from other countries where his religious beliefs and how they are intruding is of major concern.<br>

I lost my 18 year old sister last week in a car accident.  A lot of people have been telling me that their prayers are with me and such, and that isn't really offending me because I know that this is their way of expressing that they are concerned and thinking of me.  On the other hand, I don't think I would want to hear anything about her soul being in heaven or any sort of justification for her death.  I am actually taking comfort in the fact that accidents just happen as a result of our mistakes here on earth, and that this isn't any part of &quot;God's plan&quot; to get her up to heaven and blah blah blah.  W is acting very presumptuous by pushing his own religious views off onto the families of the astronauts.  He is also forgetting that the whole country(along with several others) are mourning this loss, and not just those with his religious beliefs.  If he came up to me and told me that my sister went up to heaven, then I don't know if I would think he is just being nice, or if I would think he is a jerk for pushing this off on me.  At least when people tell me that I'm in their prayers, they aren't pushing beliefs off on me.  They are just telling me how they are dealing with the news or how they feel they are helping me.  Besides, Jews supposedly go to hell anyway as part of W's dogma, and that would include my sister.  If anyone thinks my sister is rotting in hell right now, then they could kiss my ass, and that includes our POS president.  <br>
<br>
I think it was Leah that asked above if anyone noticed that we had our terror attack after the world saw we had an idiot for president.  Yes, I did notice this.  I mentioned this right after 9/11.  The terrorists knock us while we are down because they know we are powerful.  They bombed the embassies in Kenya right at the time of the impeachment hearings, and they pulled off the 9/11 attack after the world mocked our president for looking like such and idiot.  I wouldn't be suprised if they thought our guards were down again because of the shuttle, and then tried to pull something here or in Israel, or even India for that matter.  India is mourning one of their own as well due to the shuttle disaster(I wonder what religion she was).  <br>

I am so sorry to hear about your sister. That is horrible.<br>
<br>
My mom was a JW so when she died 4 years ago she had a service at the Kingdom Hall. We didn’t run in to the whole prayer and she is heaven crap because that is not what JW's believe. I didn’t really care about having a service for her because that is what she believed in and would have wanted. <br>
<br>
I do mind if a person who is supposed to represent a nation make assumptions about people. I highly doubt that if we had an A/A president that he would say at the end of a speech.... Well there gone and now they are fertilizer. It is just in poor taste to tell people what you believe when something tragic happens to somebody else’s family. These people were somebody’s brother, sister, dad ect. He should have just said he was sorry and left it at that. I am sure they could care less where Bush thinks their family member is know. Its just arrogance.<br>

I thought there was a chance that Kalpana Chawla was Hindu, but I didn't know for sure.  I also didn't know there was a Unitarian on board.  As we can see, no 2 astronauts had the same set of beliefs.  I don't think W would like it if something happened to his wife or kids, and then someone stood up and started talking about their fate in the context of a completely different religion.  There are a lot of nice things that one can say that don't involve specific religious beliefs.  I don't think he said it to intentionally be insensitive and inconsiderate, but this is all the more reason our politicians need to wake up and remember that this is not a &quot;Christian Nation&quot;.  <br>
