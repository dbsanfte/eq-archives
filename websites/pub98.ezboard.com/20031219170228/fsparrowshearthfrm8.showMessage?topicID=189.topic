Jessica Lynch Interview</span><hr size=1> Three major things stuck in my memory this morning after watching her talk with Diane Sawyer.<br>
<br>
1) Her relationship with Lori Piestewa (sp?) and how she described this lady; calm/determined/focused<br>
<br>
2) The nurses that cared for her in the hospital in Iraq; the one who sang to her and the one whose face made her feel safe.<br>
<br>
3)  The men who rescued her declined to be interviewed.<br>
<br>
Ok...4 things, that she considers herself only a 'survivor', not a hero.  I enjoyed the interview.  It was nice to hear from HER and not what all the reporters have to say--many of which don't seem to care if their sources are valid....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heartjoys>heartjoys</A> at: 11/12/03 1:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pseudologist>pseudologist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#B87333>(12/3/03 11:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=189.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pfc. Jessica Lynch Interview</span><hr size=1> I'd like to add that doctors who treated Ms. Lynch saw no bullet wounds, no stab wounds, nothing other than &quot;road traffic accident,&quot; despite reports that she had been shot and stabbed. Also, according to eyewitnesses the Iraqis had left the hospital where she was kept the day before the 'rescue,' and that U. S. forces were in complete knowledge of that. The treating doctor had also put Ms. Lynch in an ambulance to deliver her to the Americans, but the Ambulance was repelled by gunfire at a checkpoint. Also, the hospital staff offered keys to the military for the doors, but they declined and insisted on kicking the doors, and shooting blanks at invisible enemies to make it look good for the cameras. <p>Ego is a structure that is erected by a neurotic individual who is a member of a neurotic culture against the facts of the matter. And culture, which we put on like an overcoat, is the collectivized consensus about what sort of neurotic behaviors are acceptable.<br>

yes...thats been in all the reports for some time now. those were early reports...probably jumped on by media or maybe the miltary.<br>

so should they have walked up in suits and ties and asked that she be released? <br>

did the people at the checkpoint know she was in the ambulance?<br>

<br>
they had to knock the doors down...they would not have known why they were being offered keys....there is no evidence they were using blanks. that was the thought of one person on the scene. think about it...why would they use blanks? they are in the middle of a war zone. not only would it be dangerous to have guns with blanks but they could easily use real bullets.<br>

The baisc line is this, Lynch is the perfect PR are tool (wheather shes willing or not) shes 19, shes blond, and shes white. And its sssssssssooooooooooooooooo sad that she got captured by the Iraqis, never mind the other people who died in the skirmish. I'm glad at least she has some idea that they are trying to use her as a PR deivce. and frankly, I'm beginning to wonder and tire of this conflict, not because of the deaths or the anti-american sentiment, but because we have not found one single illegal weapon in Iraq, we have a whole hell of a lot of circumstancial evidense. And to date nether the Bush administration nor the media have sought to cover this. I supported this war because I was told that there were illegal weapons being stored there and Saddam refused to give them up. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">-----------------------------------------------</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

plus i've read of some males who were very heroic...but they didnt get mentioned much. <br>

blonde, young and female..works every time. the perfect american.<br>

i admire JL for what she did and for the things she has said...my only wish is that she had said them before it was during a book tour. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=189.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=189.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=189.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=189.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.threadControl?topicID=189.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=189.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=189.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="sparrowshearthfrm11">Hear Ye!
