Part 1<br>
<br>
A long time ago, an ancient and powerful pharaoh named Yami had a friend.  His name was Enrique.  He was the pharaoh's best friend.  When he was sick, he let Enrique take the throne for the day.  One day, a great battle broke out between the pharaoh and an evil mage named Seto.<br>
<br>
Seto: Yami!  I challenge you to a Shadow Game.  The stakes, the world!<br>
Yami: The stakes are too high!<br>
Seto: Are you afraid???<br>
Yami: No!  I will win the world.<br>
Seto: The world will be mine soon!<br>
<br>
Yami and Seto were in a heated Shadow Game.  Enrique saw it.  He had to do something to stop the chaos.<br>
<br>
Yami: I summon the Dark Magician!<br>
Seto: I summon the Blue Eyes White Dragon!<br>
<br>
Stone tablets rose from the ground, displaying monster carved into them.  Suddenly, holograms came out from the tablets in the shape of the monsters.<br>
<br>
Yami: Dark magic attack!<br>
Seto: White lightning!<br>
Enrique: NOOOOOO!  Stop this!<br>
<br>
Enrique runs to the center of the room where he gets caught between the attacks of the monsters.  It explodes right on him.  He was turned into stone almost instantly.<br>
<br>
Yami:  Enrique!!!  NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!<br>
Seto: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Pathetic fool.  He should have never gotten in the way.<br>
Yami: My friend is not pathetic!  You will pay.<br>
Seto: We shall see.<br>
<br>
The battle lasted for days on end.  Finally, the pharaoh won.  So he locked away the forbidden magic forever.  Or so he did.<br>
<br>
Yami: Enrique.  My friend.  My dearest friend.  Your death shall be avenged.  I shall see you again.....one day.......<br>
<br>
<br>
5000 years later.....  It has been 3 weeks since Battle City.  Everything is returning to normal.<br>
<br>
Yugi: I still can't believe Battle City is over.  Yami saved the world.<br>
Joey: You're right.  And I helped out.<br>
Mai: Joey, you couldn't help yourself out of my pants last night!  How could you have possibly helped Yami out? (Pitch-in: XD XD That was funny.)<br>
Joey: I had problems with the zipper, alright??<br>
Tristan: Sure you did.<br>
Joey: I did!<br>
<br>
Serenity walks by.  Tristan acts suave. (PI: Look forward to inner thoughts marked by *)<br>
<br>
Tristan: Hey, Serenity.<br>
Serenity: Hi Tristan. *Why must I trapped in this private hell?  Wasn't losing my sight punishment enough?*<br>
Tristan: Are you doing anything tonight because I would like to take you on a date.  For you can see the pretty lights again. *She loves me!  I'm so in her pants tonight*<br>
Serenity: Sorry Tristan.  I have other plans. *In simpler terms, FUCK OFF, RHINO WANNABE!*<br>
Tristan: NOOOO!!  I can change!<br>
Serenity: It's not you.  I'm just busy. *Change what?  Your clothes?  Oh and the 80's called.  They want their style back.*<br>
Malik: Get over it, Tristan.<br>
Tristan: She'll like me one day.<br>
Serenity: I'm still here.<br>
Group: *friendly laugh*<br>
Tea: Hey guys!<br>
Yugi: Hi Tea.<br>
Tea: I heard that there's gonna be another Egypt exhibit at the museum later today.  I heard they found a statue!  Wanna go later?<br>
Yugi: Sure.  Yami can learn more about his past!<br>
Tea: Yeah!<br>
<br>
*Inside Yugi's head*<br>
Yami: *Yugi.  They found a statue?  We must go!*<br>
Yugi: What do you mean by &quot;must&quot;?<br>
Yami: *That statue....is my friend......I'll explain later at the exhibit.*<br>
Yugi: Right.<br>
<br>
Yugi: Alright guys.  I'm going home.  I'll pick you up at 5:00, Tea.<br>
Tea: Okay.  See you later!<br>
<br>
*At Bakura's home*<br>
Bakura: I'm bored.<br>
Yami Bakura: I sense a spirit awakening.  An ancient spirit.  My Millennium Ring is showing me the way.  Come on, mortal.<br>
<br>
*Later*<br>
Yami: Now to pick up Tea.  Yugi, where does she live?<br>
Yugi: *Over there!*<br>
Yami: Okay.<br>
<br>
Yami walks down the street when he hears a whisper.<br>
*Yami!  Yami!*<br>
Yami: What's that?  Who's there?<br>
*Yami!  Friend.....*<br>
Yami: Who is it?  Enrique?<br>
*Help me!  I'm trapped as statue!*<br>
Yami: I'll help you!<br>
Tea: Hi, Yami!<br>
Yami: Tea!  Hurry to the exhibit!<br>
Tea: Okay but why?<br>
Yami: I'll explain it to you at the exhibit!<br>
<br>
*At the exhibit*<br>
Yami: Enrique.  My friend.  I'm here.  What is it you need?<br>
*Free me from this state!*<br>
Tea: Who are you talking to?<br>
Yami: Tea.  This statue is my friend.  A long time ago, he was turned into a statue.  I need to free him.<br>
Tea: How was he turned into a statue?<br>
Yami: The sorcerer and I were in a duel to decide the fate of the world.  Just before our attacks collided, he ran to the center to stop the fight.  He got caught in the crossfire and here he is now....a statue. *cries softly*<br>
Tea: Yami.....<br>
Yami: We need to change him back.  I'll use my Millennium Puzzle.  I used to let him wear it around his neck when I was sick.  Probably if I put the puzzle on him, he'll turn back.<br>
Tea: Well, give it a try!<br>
<br>
Yami puts the Millennium Puzzle around Enrique's neck.  After that, light emerged from the puzzle.  Then it surrounded the statue.  The gray stone was becoming flesh.  Moments later, Enrique stood there.  Flesh and all.  He was real again.<br>
<br>
Yami: Enrique!<br>
Enrique: Yami:  I'm alive again!<br>
Yami: I know.  My friend.<br>
Enrique: You still consider me your friend after all these years?<br>
Yami: Yes.<br>
Enrique:  Hello, who are you, my pretty lady? *grabs hand and kisses back of Tea's hand*<br>
Tea: You're such a gentleman.<br>
Enrique: Yes, of course I am.  Yami used to be jealous of my charm.<br>
Yami:  You still brag about that, eh?<br>
Enrique: Sadly, yes.<br>
Yami: That is what sets us apart.<br>
Enrique: Now, let's go and catch up.  What do you say?<br>
Tea: I would love to get to know you better!<br>
Yami: Enrique, you will stay at my counterpart's house tonight.  We shall go there and catch up.<br>
Enrique: Counterpart?<br>
*transforms into Yugi*<br>
Enrique: Hello, Yami's look alike.<br>
Yugi: Hello.  You are Enrique, right?<br>
Enrique: Yes.  And I presume you know this girl squeezing my arm?<br>
Yugi: Yeah.  That's Tea. I'm Yugi.  Nice to meet you.  Yami has told me so much about you.  Any friends of his our friends of mine.<br>
Enrique: That is nice to hear.  Now, shall we go to your home?<br>
Yugi: Sure!  Let's go. <p>          <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/business/fleming/1485/053de2c0.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
*At Yugi's house* (P.I.: This is becoming to a fanfic of Tea's obsessions XD)<br>
Yugi: No offense but in this age, you'll look ridiculous in that toga.<br>
Enrique: *strained voice*  O.....Kay......Help me!<br>
Yugi: Tea! Let go of &quot;him&quot;.  I'm too young to see that! (Yugi: Why do you make me see that?  P.I.: To add spice in this fanfic, f00!)<br>
Tea: Sorry.  He's just so irresistable!<br>
Yugi: I'll give you some money for some cliothes, okay?<br>
Enrique: Thank you.  I shall pick out my clothes.  Tea shall accompany me.  *winks*.<br>
Tea: OOOHHHHHHH.<br>
Enrique:  Right.  Anyways, I should leave you to your things.  Good day.  Come on, bitch.<br>
Tea: Ok.<br>
<br>
*At the store*(P.I.: Why did Tea respond when she was called bitch?)<br>
Enrique picks out his best clothes.  A sweat band, a basketball jersey, basketball shorts, basketball shoes and an expensive-looking necklace.  He alsos buys hair gel and AXE effect cologne.<br>
Enrique:  I also might need a mode of transportation.  I have a feeling that they don't use chariots anymore.<br>
He also buys a skateboard.  With a design of a skull bird. (Tony Hawk's Birdhouse brand)<br>
Enrique: Ok.  I'm all done.  Now to pay for them and put them on.  Tea, may I stop by your house and change?<br>
Tea: Please.<br>
Enrique: *annoyed* Ok.<br>
<br>
*At Tea's house*<br>
Tea: My parents won't be home for a few days.  You can take your time.<br>
Enrique: Whatever.<br>
Enrique changes into his modern day clothes.  Then he applies the gel and cologne.<br>
*10 minutes later*<br>
Enrique: Done.  How do I look?<br>
Tea: Great.<br>
Enrique: Now, I understand instead of stone tablets, you use papyrus for the Shadow Games?<br>
Tea: We use paper and they aren't Shadow Games anymore.  They are called Duel Monsters.<br>
Enrique: Then I shall buy my Duel Monsters.<br>
<br>
*At the store* (Again)<br>
Enrique:  I am done.  Now to find my rarest card, the Hayabusa Knight!<br>
Tea: It isn't rare.  You just suck at finding specific cards.<br>
Enrique: Found it!  It was in your thong!  I bet you put it there to seduce me.<br>
Tea: Yes I did. Check if I put the other one there.  Because I did.<br>
Enrique: Cleopatra!  It is you! :P<br>
Tea: Who is Cleopatra?  Let's go back to my place to check if I did hide that card.<br>
Enrique: Later.<br>
Tea: Haven't you noticed that I want you badly? (P.I.: Not in public, Tea! XD)<br>
Enrique: *big sweatdrop*  Ummmmmm.......<br>
Tea: If you want it so badly,  just tell me!<br>
Enrique: *hesitated answer* *exhale*  Fine.  Just to satisfy you.<br>
Tea: YAY!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Enrique: *thinking* Oh God!  What have I gotten myself into?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Enrique and Tea walk out the store.  When they're halfway to Tea's house, Enrique spots a kid struggling with another kid for a deck.<br>
Kid: Hey!  Let go of my deck!<br>
Kid #2: I'm gonna get that card no matter what!<br>
Tea: *gasp*  It's Weevil!  That's no good son of a bitch is trying to steal a kid's deck!  Stop him, Enrique!<br>
Enrique: Hey, Weevil!  Let go of his cards!<br>
Weevil: Well, well.  If it isn't the dollar whore, Tea!  With another guy?<br>
Tea: Shut the fuck up, Weevil!  This is Enrique and he's an equal of Yugi!<br>
Weevil: Equal, eh?<br>
Tea: Yea!<br>
Enrique: Stop this!  Weevil, I challenge you to a duel!  If I win, you will give back the deck!<br>
Weevil: Deal.  But if you lose, you are gonna have to give me YOUR deck!  HAHAHAHAHA!<br>
Enrique: Fine.  We'll duel!  Good thing I bought this before I left.  (Duel thing)<br>
E &amp; W: Duel!<br>
<br>
Enrique: 4000          Weevil: 4000<br>
<br>
Enrique: I'll go first.  *thinks* Good cards!  But not good enough.  *aloud* I put 1 card f/d and a monster f/d in def.  That ends my turn.<br>
Weevil: I'll summon the Insect Soldiers of the Sky!! *comes out*<br>
Enrique: Not so fast!  I flip Trap Hole!<br>
Weevil: Damn.  Stupid fucker!  I end my turn.<br>
Enrique: This is gonna hurt me but it's gonna hurt you more!  Dark Elf in attack mode.  I sacrifice 1000 of my Life Points to inflict 2000 Life Points on you!  And that's ends my turn.<br>
Weevil: NOOOO!!!<br>
<br>
Enrique: 3000          Weevil: 2000<br>
<br>
Weevil: You're good.  But not good enough!  Larvae Moth combined with Cocoon of Evolution!  HAHAHAHAHA!!!  And I put it in def mode.<br>
Enrique: *growls* Damn.<br>
Weevil: In 5 turns, you will lose to my moth!<br>
Enrique: We'll see about that! *thinks* I gotta crack that cocoon!<br>
Tea: Come on, Enrique!  Beat his ass!<br>
Enrique: I'll stick something up yours later, baby.(P.I.: Alternate Line)<br>
Enrique: You don't have to tell me twice.<br>
<br>
Enrique: 3000          Weevil: 2000<br>
<br>
Enrique: That was a bad choice, Weevil.  You just lost!<br>
Weevil: What are you talking about?<br>
Enrique: I flip my down card.  The Man Eater Bug!<br>
Weevil: NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!<br>
Enrique: Yep.  And now to atk you with Dark Elf.  Attack!!<br>
Weevil: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  I've been beaten in 3 turns.  You got lucky!<br>
<br>
Enrique: 2000          Weevil: 0<br>
<br>
Enrique: Now hand it over, Weevil.<br>
Weevil: No!<br>
Enrique: I'll beat the shit out of you!<br>
Weevil: Okay. *hands over deck*<br>
Enrique: Here you go, kid.  No cards taken.<br>
Kid: Thank you!  I'm your biggest fan now, mister!<br>
Tea: Second best. *strokes Enrique's hair*<br>
E &amp; K: Riiiiiiiiight...............<br>
Kid: Good bye!<br>
E &amp; T: Bye!<br>
Tea: Now, where were we?<br>
Enrique: Why did Weevil call you a dollar whore?<br>
Tea: He's just obnoxious.<br>
Enrique: He's just funny!<br>
Tea: Shut up!  *whacks Enrique on head with purse*<br>
Enrique: What the hell do you have in there?<br>
Tea: Condoms, dildos, whips, the usual. (P.I.: XD)<br>
Enrique: *big sweatdrop* *thinks* WHAT THE FUCK HAVE I GOTTEN MYSELF INTO?!?!?!??!<br>
Tea: Is something wrong?<br>
Enrique: Yes.  The stuff you have!  The way I do it is the old fashioned way!<br>
<br>
*At Tea's house*<br>
Enrique and Tea play video games!  What were you expecting? XD<br>
Tea: This isn't what I had in mind.<br>
Enrique: Just let me turn this off and turn you on!<br>
(P.I.: Too graphic because children might be watching.  Looks like the people who were expecting what wasn't supposed to be expected turned out to be what was expected.  What the hell was I saying?) <p>          <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/business/fleming/1485/053de2c0.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

*1 hour later*<br>
<br>
Enrique was kissing Tea goodbye as he left her house.<br>
Tea: Fuck you later!<br>
Enrique: *To self* Ow. *Aloud* Bye, babe! *To self* She hurt &quot;me&quot;.  She bitch-slapped me!  *Mocks Tea* What's my name, bitch?  Say it.  Louder.  Shove this in for me. *Normal voice*  I'm not going to do that with her again!  Well, maybe a few more times. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm so irresistable!  I'll go to Yugi's house to meet him.  I'm bored.<br>
Enrique goes to Yugi's house.<br>
<br>
*5 minutes later*<br>
Enrique enters Yugi's house.  Only to find Yugi's other friends, Tristan, Mai, Joey, Serenity, Malik, and Bakura.<br>
Yami Bakura *inside Bakura's head*: I sense the spirit close by.  My Millennium Ring shows me that he is the spirit.  I must dispose of him.  There cannot be any other ancient spirits besides the Yamis.<br>
Bakura in head:  I don't want to.  If he is a friend of Yugi's, he must be nice.<br>
Yami Bakura: If you won't, I will!<br>
Bakura gets up.<br>
Yugi: Hey, Bakura.  Where are you going?  Don't you want to meet Enrique?<br>
Yami Bakura: Yes but....(clears voice)Bakura's voice: Yes but I just need to get a little bit of water.  My voice is becoming a tad raspy.<br>
Yugi: Okay.<br>
Yami Bakura: That insolent Yugi doesn't suspect my plan.  My plan is to kill Enrique!  No other spirits shall interfere with me ruling the world!  Now to grab this ordinary butcher knife....<br>
Bakura: No.  I can't.<br>
Yami Bakura: You WILL!<br>
Yami Bakura grabs the knife.  When he walks back into the living room, Enrique has his back turned to the kitchen doorway.<br>
Yami Bakura: You shall die!<br>
Enrique turns around only to have his face stabbed by Yami Bakura! (Alternate line)(P.I.: I mean come on!  He's the hero!)<br>
Enrique turns around and suddenly grabs Yami Bakura's forearm.  Enrique's grip is so tight that Yami Bakura drops the knife on the floor.  Then Tea walked in the door.<br>
Tea, Malik, Mai, Yugi, Tristan &amp; Serenity: Enrique!!<br>
Enrique: Hold on!  *To Yami Bakura* Now.  Why are you doing this?  We barely met!<br>
Bakura: Sorry.  I'm not doing it.  My Millennium item is controlling me!<br>
Enrique: I believe you.  I know about the Millennium Ring.  I'll take it off for you.<br>
Enrique takes off the Ring off of Bakura.<br>
Enrique: There.  Now, no evil shall plague you.<br>
Bakura: Thank you.  My name is Bakura.<br>
Tristan: Hiya.  Tristan's my name.<br>
Joey: What up.  I'm Joey.  2nd in Duelist Kingdom, runner-up in Battle City.<br>
Malik: Evil used to plague once.  But Yami ridded me of it.  By the way, I'm Malik.<br>
Serenity: You are the best thing I've seen since my bandages have been removed.<br>
Mai: You can fuck me anytime!  Here's my number if you wanna get nasty with me. *hands paper to Enrique*<br>
Joey: Hey.  Serenity, you said that when I almost won Battle City.  Mai, you're my girlfriend!<br>
Serenity: He's just irresistable!<br>
Mai: I'm starting to feel my woman sensations kicking in!<br>
Enrique: Cool!  Well, I'm tired.  Tea should know why.<br>
The group turns to Tea.<br>
Tea: What?  He's irresistable!<br>
Yugi: Come on, Tea!  That's sick!<br>
Serenity and Mai walk up to Tea.<br>
Mai: How was it?<br>
Serenity: Is he as good as he looks?<br>
Tea:  Great and yes.<br>
Serenity and Mai: Yay!  WE wanna try!<br>
Tea: You mean the three of us!<br>
The three girls: YAY!<br>
Enrique: Yay I guess.<br>
Tristan: You are lucky, Enrique!  I can't even grab Serenity's ass!<br>
Serenity: That was YOU???  I thought Yugi was the one turning me on!<br>
Yugi: Me?  Cool! *gets horny* *inside Yugi's head* Yami: Not again.  Yugi, this is the 4th time this morning!<br>
Serenity: That's nothing.  I can't wait for Enrique to get &quot;into&quot; me.<br>
Mai: Neither can I.<br>
Tea: Let's go to my house!  It's fun over there!<br>
Enrique: Yay. See ya guys.  *Holds up banner that says, &quot;Help me from Tea!&quot;* <br>
Boys: See ya, dude!<br>
And so Enrique and the whores leave.  To Tea's house they go.  Enrique holds Mai and Tea's hands while he gives Serenity a piggy-back ride.  What a group, huh?  As you can tell, the AXE effect cologne really works with the ladies.<br>
<br>
*10 minutes later*<br>
Enrique, exhausted: We're....here.....finally.<br>
Mai: Are you tired already?  I bet that's just to get himself more pumped.<br>
As Enrique enters the house, he finds Rex Raptor!<br>
Enrique: Who are you?  What the hell are you doing here?<br>
Rex: Tea promised me sex!<br>
Tea: What are you doing here so early?  I said at 11:00!<br>
Rex: It is!<br>
Tea: 11 at night, dimwit!<br>
Rex: I find you with 2 girls and a guy??  Such a slut....<br>
Tea: Shut up!  Enrique will duel you.  If he wins, get the hell out of my house.  If you win, you can join us.<br>
Enrique:  What the fuck?!?  I'm not gay!<br>
Mai: Ya.  I don't want dino breath in my pants!<br>
Serenity: Just what I was gonna say!<br>
Tea: Do it for me, Enrique!<br>
Enrique: Fine.  Rex, let's duel.<br>
E &amp; R: Duel!<br>
<br>
Enrique: 4000          Rex: 4000<br>
<br>
Enrique: I'll go first.  I put two cards f/d and lay Goblin Attack Force in attack mode!  That ends my turn.<br>
Rex: I'll put one card f/d and put down Uraby in atk mode!<br>
Enrique: Fine.  I play Tribute to the Doomed!  And I sacrifice the Premature Burial to activate it.  Your Uraby's dead and I atk you directly with Goblin Attack Force.  That brings you down to 1700 Life Points.<br>
Rex: Asshole.<br>
<br>
Enrique: 4000          Rex: 1700<br>
<br>
Girls: Go Enrique!  Go Enrique!  Go Enrique!<br>
Rex: Shut up!  I play a mon in defense mode.  I end my turn.<br>
Enrique: I play Nobleman of Crossout!<br>
Rex: My Trakadon!<br>
Enrique: I end my turn.<br>
<br>
Enrique: 4000          Rex: 1700<br>
<br>
Rex: I play Soul Exchange and summon my Megazowler!<br>
Enrique: Sorry but say hi to Solemn Judgment.<br>
Rex: No, no, no, no, no!<br>
Enrique: I play it and sacrifice half of my Life Points.<br>
Rex: Damn.  I have to end my turn.<br>
Girls: YAY!!<br>
Enrique: Well, I switch my Goblin Attack Force in atk mode and hit you directly.  I win.  Now get out of this house and let me do my &quot;work&quot; in peace.<br>
Rex: Fuck!<br>
<br>
Enrique: 2000          Rex: 0<br>
<br>
Mai: You're gonna get it.  You have earned it.<br>
Serenity: She's right.  I'm gonna give it a little more than I wanted to give.<br>
Tea: You're gonna love me this time.<br>
Enrique: Hey, what else could I ask for?<br>
<br>
(And so they fuck each other all night)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, at Yugi's house, an unexpected visitor stops by for Malik.<br>
Isis: Malik.  Time to go home, brother.<br>
Malik: Ok.<br>
<br>
*Malik and Isis go home*<br>
<br>
Malik: Hi mom!<br>
Isis: Mom isn't here.  I called you for a special reason.<br>
Malik: You're my sister!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(echo)<br>
<br>
(And so THEY fuck each other all night)  God this is twisted. <p>          <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/business/fleming/1485/053de2c0.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
*The next day*<br>
Yugi and friends are at home.  All bored.  Don't expect anything.<br>
Joey: Let's go to the beach!<br>
Tristan: Sounds like a good idea.<br>
Malik: God please take me to the beach.  Away from my sister for now!<br>
Yugi: Okay.<br>
<br>
*At the beach*<br>
Enrique is enjoying his life at the beach.  Serenity, Mai, and Tea are with him.  Malik is also there.<br>
Enrique: Damn, life is good.<br>
Serenity: I agree.<br>
Malik: I don't.  My sister raped me!<br>
Enrique: Oh god no.<br>
Mai: Ewwwwww.<br>
Malik: I tried to stop her but she said that she saw that I will enjoy it with her Millennium Necklace. (P.I.: EWWWWWWWW!!!! XD)<br>
Tea: And did you?<br>
Malik: Sadly but yes.<br>
Enrique and girls: EWWWWWW!<br>
Enrique: At least you got some ass!!  Like me but I got 2 more asses 2 deal with!<br>
Mai: And I assume you had fun shoving your tree in my cave? (P.I.: ROFLMFAO!! XD XD XD XD)<br>
Enrique: Ummmm.  Ya, whatever.<br>
Yugi and friends join Enrique and friends.<br>
Joey: Hey Mai.  Are you ready to date me again?<br>
Mai: I found a guy that knows better than shoving his finger in my ass.<br>
Joey: That was my.....&quot;thing&quot;.<br>
Mai: That small?  You have problems.<br>
Joey: *disappointed voice* I know.  Serenity, I see that you got a boyfriend.  Looks like I will stop raping you at night when you're sleeping.<br>
Everyone: WHAT??<br>
Serenity: No wonder why I wasn't a virgin the night I woke up 4 weeks after my surgery.  Just before my bandages were removed!  I just thought that feeling was my dream!  (P.I.: Can this get anymore twisted?)<br>
Mai: You were cheating on me with your SISTER??<br>
Joey: You wouldn't give me any ass that night!<br>
Yugi gets horny. *inside Yugi's head* Yami: *annoyed tone of voice* Stop this please!  Goddammit!  Yugi, I've told you so many times.  Pay a fucking prostitute!  You use all that money on cards you never use!  You know what money.  The money your Grampa gives you to buy cards.  You get like 200 dollars a week! (P.I.: Looks like it can get more twisted)<br>
Suddenly a frisbee lands on Enrique.<br>
Mokuba: Sorry.  My big brother threw it too hard that time. (Mokuba: How come I'm never in any fanfics besides Eriko Myoujin's fics? P.I.: You're too small to get noticed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
Yugi: Hi Mokuba.<br>
Mokuba: Hey Yugi.  Hey guys!<br>
Everyone: Hey.<br>
Enrique: Hello.  I believe we haven't met.  I'm Enrique.<br>
Mokuba: I'm Mokuba.<br>
Kaiba: Hey little bro.  Where did you wander off to?  Hey!  Yugi, what are you doing here!?<br>
Yugi: I was bored so I came here with friends.<br>
Enrique: *inside head* He looks so familiar!  I've seen him somewhere!  But where.....?<br>
Kaiba: *inside head* Where have I seen him before?<br>
Bakura: Why are you guys staring at each other?<br>
Enrique: Oh.  No reason.  He just looks familiar.<br>
Tristan: Yea.  He's the intercontinental champion, Kaiba.  Everyone has seen him!<br>
Enrique: He is?  But that's not it.  Somewhere else....<br>
Yugi: *inside head* Yugi!  Enrique is remembering his past!  He is going to want to get revenge!<br>
Enrique: I remember where!  5000 years ago, you turned me into stone.<br>
Kaiba: That WAS you!<br>
Enrique: Tristan, Joey, hold me back. *Tristan and Joey hold Enrique's arms* Let me at 'im!  I'll get you!<br>
Kaiba: Come on little brother.<br>
Mokuba: Bye!<br>
Everyone except Enrique (who is still struggling): Bye.<br>
Enrique: I'll get you one day!<br>
&quot;YU-GI-OH!!!!&quot;<br>
Yami: Enrique.  You remember!  But I recommend you duel him but you have to practice!  He has an Egyptian God card!<br>
Enrique: Those rare cards?  Which one does he have?<br>
Yami: Obelisk the Tormentor.  I have Slifer the Sky Dragon.  Malik there has the Winged Dragon of Ra.<br>
Enrique: No way!  I have to beat him to get revenge!<br>
Yami: There's an upcoming tournament in my grampa's shop.  Practice there.<br>
Enrique: When is it?<br>
Yami: In 1 week.<br>
Enrique: Ok.  Let's enjoy the beach.<br>
So they enjoyed the beach.  Enrique ask Mai, Serenity, and Tea to bend over to see their asses in thongs but let's not get into that.  You guys know what happened between the four of them.  The week went by normally except for Isis wanted to join the girls.  Yes.  Everyday, the sparks flew.<br>
<br>
*1 week later*<br>
Enrique: The tournament is here.  I'm ready.<br>
Enrique walked up to Grampa.<br>
Enrique: I would like to register for the tournament.<br>
Grampa: Okay.  You are lucky.  Your grabbed the last position left.<br>
Enrique: Cool.  When is the competition going to start?<br>
Grampa: Soon.<br>
<br>
*Soon*<br>
Enrique's first opponent was Meiko Tsunami.<br>

E &amp; M: Duel!<br>

<br>
Meiko: I'll start.  I'll play 1 card face down. And play Red Archery Girl!  End turn.<br>

Meiko: I drew Turtle Oath, 2 Weather Reports, Root Water and and a ritual card, Fortress Whale's Oath!<br>

Meiko: Once you do, I'll be unbeatable!  I play 2 mons f/d and Root Water in atk mode!<br>
Enrique: I play Gearfried and Mech Chaser.<br>
Meiko: I'll end my turn.<br>

Then I play Axe of Despair on my Mech Chaser.  Raising his atk to 2850!  I atk your Root Water with my Mech Chaser.  Then I use Gearfried to atk one of your Weather Reports. I end my turn.<br>
<br>
Enrique: 2600          Meiko: 950<br>
<br>
Meiko: Damn you, fucker.  I play Swords of Revealing Light!  That will keep you at bay for 3 full turns.  I'll also play Umi.  The field changes into the sea!<br>
Enrique: Whoa.<br>
Meiko: Lastly, I'll sacrifice my remaining Weather Report and play The Legendary Fisherman!!<br>
Enrique: No....<br>
Meiko: I think I'll attack your Gearfried.<br>
<br>
Enrique: 2550          Meiko: 950<br>
<br>
Enrique: I'll play my Tributed to the Doomed.  By sacrificing my Premature Burial.<br>
Meiko: Damn.<br>
Enrique: I can't atk so I'll end turn.<br>
Meiko: I'll play Water Omotics and end my turn.<br>
Enrique: I will play a card f/d down and end my turn.<br>
Meiko: I'll play Twin Long Rods #2.  I end.<br>
Enrique: I pass this turn.  But your Swords of Revealing Light are gone.<br>
Meiko: I'm aware of that.  So I'll flip my f/d card.  Fortress Whale's Oath!<br>
Enrique: You have to have the Ritual monster card!<br>
Meiko: I do.  So I play Fortress Whale by sacrificing my 2 monsters to my oath!<br>
Enrique: Damn.  I'm in trouble.  That thing is big!<br>
Meiko: HAHAHA.  I place a card f/d and end my turn.<br>
Enrique: My Mech Chaser is stronger.  Attack!<br>
Meiko: Fuck.<br>

Enrique: 2550          Meiko: 450<br>
<br>
Meiko: I'll place a monster f/d.  I end my turn.<br>
Enrique: Attack!<br>
Meiko: It's a Magician of Faith!<br>
Enrique: No.  You're getting your Swords back!<br>

Enrique: I end.<br>
Meiko: I play Swords of Revealing Light!  3 more turns!  I'll end my turn.<br>
Enrique: I'll send 3 cards from my hand to the grave and end my turn.<br>
Meiko: I'll play Turtle Tiger in attack mode!  And end.<br>
Enrique: I'll send 2 cards from my hand to the grave and end my turn.<br>
Meiko: I play Skull Mariner!  That ends my turn.<br>
Enrique: I pass.<br>
Meiko: Again, I play another ritual card!  Turtle Oath!  I sacrifice and play the strongest water monster, Crab Turtle!!  I won't atk because your monster is stronger.  I'll end.<br>
Enrique:  I will play Swords of Revealing Light.  I will atk ur Crab Turtle.<br>

Enrique: I play Hayabusa Knight!  And equip him with an Axe of Despair.  I end.<br>
Meiko: I pass.<br>
Enrique: I'll send my hand to the graveyard.  And end my turn.<br>
Meiko: Swords of Revealing Light are done.  And so are you.  Crab Turtle, atk!!<br>
Enrique: This is a crazy move but if I'm lucky enough, I'll win.  I play........Skull Dice!  If I roll a 6, I'll win.  Go dice roll!<br>
The dice rolls......will Enrique be lucky enough to pull it off!  Or will he wipe out???  It all depends on a dice roll............<br>
<br>

Mai walks in.<br>
Mai: I knew I'd find you here!<br>
Enrique: Oh.  Hi, Mai.<br>
Mai: Well.  I came to ask if you need some energy.  If you know what I mean.<br>
Enrique: Hold on.  Give me two minutes.  Lemme fix up my skateboard.  Its wheels are unscrewed.<br>
Mai: Like me.  You gave Tea some the other day.  By herself.  It's my turn now.<br>
Enrique: Fixed!  Now, let's screw!!!<br>
<br>
They go to dark room.<br>
<br>
Mai: I want you baby.<br>
Enrique: Oh baby.<br>
Enrique takes off Mai's tube top to reveal a see-through bra.<br>
Mai: You're making me wet, Enrique.<br>
Enrique: You know I am.<br>
Enrique took off Mai's bra very slowly to soothe her needs.  He strokes her breasts as if they were the most precious thing in the world.<br>
Mai: Oooohhhhhhh.<br>
Enrique starts sucking them.  The milk was leaking.  It tastes like sweet nectar from a watermelon.  Enrique slowly takes off Mai's skirt.  She took off her thong herself.  Enrique lowers his pants and Mai starts grabbing his dick.  She shoves it in her cunt as if she was the most desparate woman on earth.  Enrique's dick feels warm in there.<br>
Mai: Stop.<br>
Enrique: What?<br>
Mai: I wanna try sumptin new.<br>
Enrique: What?<br>
Mai gets on top of Rick, her back facing him.  She starts bouncing on him with his dick in her cunt.  Up and down, up and down.  She gets off of him.  She bends down and starts tonguing his balls.  Mai strokes his sack slowly until the boner is in her face.<br>
Mai: I got you turned on enough.<br>
Enrique: What are you going to do?<br>
Mai give Enrique a handjob.  When he starts cumming, she opens her mouth until her mouth is filled with the cum.<br>
Mai: Time for foreplay.  She grabs his dick again and he moves it in and out.  In and out.  She rubs her pussy slowly.  Slowly.<br>
Mai: Harder.  Please!  (moans)  Harder!  So good!  HARDER!<br>
Enrique: How's that?<br>
Mai: Hold it there!  You got my G-spot.<br>
Enrique: Oh ya, baby.<br>
Mai: Ooh.  Ooooh.<br>
Enrique: Oh ya!  Lemme hear it!<br>
Mai: (moans loudly)  Let's try doggy-style.<br>
Enrique turns her around, bends her over and shoves his dick up her ass.  Her ass.  So soft.  Smooth.  Clean.  No blemishes or moles or anything nasty like that.  5 minutes into it, she starts to bleed.<br>
Mai: Harder Enrique!  Don't stop!  You have just gotten me turned on!<br>
In and out.  In and out.  Mai's breasts, swaying back and forth.  Left and right.  He picks her up and leaves his dick in her ass.  He starts fingering her.  Her hairless pussy smooth.  Her ass dripping with blood.  Her honey-blond hair on her neck.  He kisses her neck softly and caresses her gentle body.<br>
Mai: Enough.  Let's save some for tomorrow.  Well.  Just a little bit more foreplay.<br>
Enrique lays her down on the bed.  Her body layed on the bed.  Gently.  He starts kissing her neck, down, he begins sucking her breasts.  He works his way to her stomach.  He licks it.<br>
Mai: Ooooooooh.  That feels good.<br>
He goes further down until he reaches her pussy.  He starts licking it.  Shoving his tongue way up her cunt.<br>
Mai: Oh, Enrique.  You're making me wet.<br>
He gets up and shoves his dick in her pussy.  In and out.  Bringing his woman pleasure.  Pleasure she has never gotten before.<br>
Mai: (moans) Please.  Harder, Enrique.  Don't stop.  I'm just getting started! (moans louder)<br>
Enrique: Take it babe.<br>
Mai: My turn.<br>
She gets on top of him.  She starts chuckling.<br>
Mai: You're gonna love this.<br>
Mai starts licking Enrique's dick.  She shoves it in her mouth.  Jacking it off until his cum comes out.  Soon, her mouth is dripping with white liquid.<br>
Mai: Mmmmmmm......<br>
Soon after, she starts licking his balls again.  she shoves his bag in her mouth.  She starts sucking on it.  Enrique feels unexplainable pleasure.<br>
Mai: I'm done.<br>
Enrique: Me too.  Did you like that?<br>
Mai: I loved it.  But I forgot something.  I'll do it next time.<br>
Enrique: What did you forget?<br>
Mai: 69.<br>
She puts on her clothes slowly for Enrique can get enticed.<br>
Mai: Keep this.  For you can remember me. *hands thong to Enrique* For good luck.<br>
Mai walks to him and french kisses him.  With tongue.  As she walks away, her ass sways left and right.  Before she left, she blew him a kiss.<br>
Mai: Bye big boy. *winks*<br>
Enrique: Bye baby.<br>
When she turns around, she lifts up her skirt and shows him her ass.<br>
Mai: This got a lot of attention.  My pussy wants the same attention next time.<br>
She puts down her skirt and leaves.  Her ass is obviously showing. <p>          <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/business/fleming/1485/053de2c0.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Yami: Thank you.  Isis, let's go to the Dark Room.<br>
Isis: Yes, my pharaoh.  I will do it to you better than anyone has ever done it to you.  My brother won't mind.<br>
Yami: Malik?  What about him?<br>
Isis: He's my sex toy!<br>
Yami: All right!  I get a whore!!  Thank you, Rick!  Now let me show you what a pharaoh can do to a girl!<br>
Rick: Your welcome!  Remember, Isis has 6 G-spots!  If you finish and miss one, you'll have to do it again!  Get them all and she'll probably leave you alone!  She's like a video game, everyone loves to play her!<br>
Yami: I can tell.<br>
<br>
*25 minutes later*<br>
Yami: I got them all!!!<br>
Rick: You ready, Yami?<br>
Yami: Yes.  And the best of luck to you!<br>
Rick: You too.<br>
R &amp; Y: Duel!<br>
As Yami and Rick prepare to duel, one question remains unanswered: Will Rick win and defeat Kaiba, once and for all to get revenge for what happened 5000 years ago? <p>          <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/business/fleming/1485/053de2c0.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
