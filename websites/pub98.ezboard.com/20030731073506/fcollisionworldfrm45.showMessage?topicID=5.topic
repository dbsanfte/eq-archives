He was a big help in this port for a small fee.

Don't want anyone knowing she is here.&quot; He went up front with a fake ticket to get aboard. 'Mmm... going home again...' He put on his Kurt mask again and walked into the ship supposedly un noticed.<br>
<br>
(Derla)<br>
Derla panicked as she heard someone on a PA system say that this was the last call for flight 115ISSB... the one Kage had mumbled to the boy who put her here. 'Crow? Where are you?' She tried to knock open the bag to no avail. The PA came back on.<br>

Cursing, Crow glided through the crowded port, eyes searching for his quarry.<br>
<br>
Urgh... Forgot how much I loathed these places...<br>
<br>
/115ISSB./<br>
<br>
Spinning, Crow looked frantically at the departure times hanging above his head.  &quot;Twenty dang minutes?!&quot; he muttered aloud.  He turned his gaze back to the scurrying, rushing crowd, and was unable to see a trace of Derla or her kidnapper anywhere.<br>
<br>
/Contacting the contact... back there/<br>
<br>
Crow looked, his 3i attracting some odd looks.  He couldn't be bothered with that now.  He cautiously crept to the back of the wall, where he spotted a young man holding an oversized bag.  He was walking away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oi!!  You there!!&quot; Crow shouted, running towards him.  He stopped short of the boy, glaring.  &quot;You got the girl?!&quot;<br>

&quot;CROW! IN HERE HELP!&quot; Derla screamed round her gag. &quot;JEEZ, CROW! HE'S PUTTING ME IN THE CARGO AREA! HELP!&quot;<br>
<br>
The boy hit the bag, hard. &quot;It's nuttin', really. Just some dirty laundry and garbage.&quot; He turned around and began running to the cargo loading dock. &quot;Boss'll kill me if she's late...' he muttered, not paying any attention to the guy behind him.<br>

<br>
Crow blinked and held the boy's arm.  &quot;Crow?  Got no idea what she's talkin' about... Stupid, I know it's the girl.  Kage wants me to watch her.&quot;<br>
<br>
He folded his arms and narrowed his eyes, hoping beyond hope that the contact boy would figure that anyone who knew Kage's name was on his side.  &quot;Unless you want to disobey orders. I need money for the ticket though.  Kage said you'd have some...&quot;<br>

<br>
In the bag, Derla was practically shouting for joy. &quot;Thank goodness! He's an idiot! I'm getting out of here!&quot; Che felt the bag move from one person's hand to another's. Then she heard someone scream about a fake passenger. Kage, she hoped.<br>
<br>
(Kage)<br>
Kage not only was a slave trader, but an excellent pickpocket too. He had traded his ticket for some snob's. 'Sorry sir, but I'm going home to make my money. And I can't afford to get caught now.&quot; He had bought a real ticket, but it was null invoid until the right flight, two days from now. He had his prize now, he needed to make it home.<br>
<br>
Derla was uncertain where Crow was going. All she could get out of their location was that they  had turned and were going fast. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 348<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/2/03 7:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ship to  the SS (Space Station) Gingivere, now boarding!</span><hr size=1> <br>

&quot;Brother...&quot;  Crow rolled his eyes, but it was kind of hard to tell what with the lack of pupils and all.  &quot;Duh.  Just give me the ticket.  In fact, give me the girl, too.  I don't think I can trust you with her... Mebbe I should put her away myself.  Sheesh.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hoping that the kid wouldn't notice the abrupt subject change, Crow swiftly looked aorund and added, &quot;By th' way, have you seen the- er- boss around?  I need to ask him something.&quot;<br>

As casually as possible, Crow hoisted up the bag and sidled away with it towards the cargo bay; not intending, of course, to put Derla there at all.<br>
<br>
Once safely behind a wall, Crow gently let the bag down with a grunt and tugged at the opening.  &quot;...Derla?!  It's okay...

Temporarily at a loss for words, Crow returned Derla's embrace.  &quot;...good thing Kage hires numbskulls...&quot; was all he could think of to say.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, it was time to do a little thinking.  It wasn't that hard.<br>
<br>

Crow felt like cackling, but he wisely decided not to.  Already the pair were beginning to atract unhealthy looks, and to make matters worse, they were standing directly under a sign that said &quot;No Loitering&quot;.  He took Derla's hand and began ambling towards the exit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dinner sounds like a really good idea,&quot; he nodded, whistling.  <br>
&quot;Where to?  You pick; it's on me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unable to restrain himself at that point, Crow began to giggle foolishly.  &quot;Wish I could see the look on that lunatic's face... Heh heh heh...&quot;<br>
<br>
A security gaurd looked suspiciously at Crow's synteshart as they passed, and at the way he was leading Derla out; but in another second, they were out of there.<br>
