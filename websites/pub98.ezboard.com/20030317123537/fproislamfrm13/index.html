<br>
<br>
A few months back, George Bush Jr. suggested that a war with Iraq was not inevitable; in fact, it could be avoided altogether as long as Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi people turn over all information about their war machine and surrender any weapons of mass destruction.  Become a responsible nation in the world community, King George promised, and we will leave you alone.
<br>
<br>
Of course, this lie is as empty as the lie of a reconstructed Afghanistan.  As Bush and his playmates insinuate the probability of a possible peace if this happens or that happens, a steady stream of military personnel, heavy artillery, and military strategists has been floating to the Arabian Gulf.  His words are given the lie by the actions of his administration; a steady increase in the war rhetoric as the final judgment day for Iraq approaches.  Billions of dollars have already been invested in shipping our people there; I am sure the Bush Administration is not footing the bill for a day at the sand dunes.  After all, this is an investment, much like Afghanistan was.
<br>
<br>
Whatever became of Afghanistan?  Shortly after the mass murder of some 3,000 expatriate forces by our benevolent “allies” referred to as the Northern Alliance, we quickly lost touch with that part of the world.  In fact, according to world-renowned independent filmmaker Jamie Doran, US forces collaborated in the torture of POWs and the killing of thousands of captured Taliban soldiers near the town of Mazar-i-Sharif.
We also watched millions of refugees pour back into Afghanistan from Pakistan and Iran. We will now watch them starve to death and freeze to death, since less than 10% of the aid promised by Bush and his liberation forces has arrived in Afghanistan to date.  With Karzai in effective control of the Presidential Palace and bloodthirsty warlords controlling the remaining 99.9% of Afghanistan, our efforts at exporting democracy seems to have failed miserably.  This is, of course, based upon the premise that the US really did want to export democracy, rather than oil.
<br>
<br>
After these particularly embarrassing debacles, it was nearly a relief when ex-oil executive Hamid Karzi finally gave the United States the thumbs-up to build a trans-Afghanistan oil pipeline that would feed out of our other “War on Terror” partner, Pakistan.  This deal’s windfall would be in excess of $3.1 billion dollars just in construction, and untold trillions in the transportation of oil from Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to Pakistan.  
<br>
<br>
And now we look upon the evil and tyrannical face of Saddam Hussein.  We look at his murder of the Kurds over the last 20 years.  We look at his suppression of democracy.  Most importantly, we look at the potential for death in the weapons of mass destruction that he has pointed at us this very moment, coordinates set and fingers on the trigger, ready to destroy our way of life.  We know why we must go to war once again.
<br>
<br>
However, what we forget to note is that 20% of the oil reserves of the planet reside under Iraq.  The country is literally floating on oil.  It has more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia. These reserves are practically untouched; the last war destroyed most of the oil extraction and processing equipment, and the inability to repair damaged equipment has done in most of the ones that survived.  Trillions will go into rebuilding that oil infrastructure, and trillions will come out in black gold; that is the price of the blood of our youth.
<br>
<br>
The Bush Administration has no interest in promoting democracy.  They could care even less about the Kurds, who were annihilated in 1991 by the Iraqi Army the US failed to keep its promise and render support during a popular uprising encouraged by the first Bush administration.  
<br>
<br>
And the weapons of mass destruction?  That will end up as the biggest lie told to date by George W. Bush.  After weeks and weeks of frantic, frenzied searches using the most technologically sophisticated detection equipment on the face of the earth, the inspectors have turned up nothing.  Even with the alleged US secret evidence, the inspectors have found nothing.  Now the US is forced to suggest that the weapons have been sent to Iran for safekeeping, to avoid the long arm of the United States, never mind that Iran and Iraq are mortal enemies, and Iran suffered the only chemical attack in modern history courtesy of Saddam Hussein.
