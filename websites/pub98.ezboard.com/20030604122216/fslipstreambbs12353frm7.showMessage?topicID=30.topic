(Spoilers)</span><hr size=1> O.k. I promised a review, and here it is.  I don't have much time, so I don't think this is going to be long, but I have some semblence of coherent thought that I'd like to share.<br>
<br>
First things first:  I stand corrected.  I had originally refused to watch any more Andromeda eps.  But <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Neptunian</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> got me interested with a second-half spoiler review... so I peeked my head in to check out The Unconquerable Man, sat out (apparently mercifully) Delenda Est, and watched The Dark Backward.  I enjoyed the two episodes that I watched.  A lot.  I'm glad I've joined on the bandwagon of those who are tuning in for the ZackAsh eps.<br>
<br>
Now that that's out of the way, let me talk about what I really liked in this episode, and what I think of Trance Gemini now...<br>
<br>
Ok.  Correction.  Let me talk about Trance Gemini now... since that's what I really liked about this episode... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Some have complained that Trance is omnipotent as she has been drawn.  Certainly, she is very powerful.  But then, didn't we always know that?  We knew that she was manipulating things toward a perfect possible future - her powers therefore HAD to be to somehow create the same, either through calculations or SOMETHING... my greatest disappointment is that it appears to have been the something!  I was hoping for a mathematical genius in Trance... LOL!  Anyway, I don't think she is all powerful, and I don't think she is a reset button.  For one thing - she isn't interested in creating only good outcomes (which our voyager reset button does), but the ones that lead to where she wants to go.  For another - she can and has failed, hence, Gold Trance.  But more importantly - in this episode - NOTHING has been reset!  Unless I missed something - Trance started calculating possibilities over and over again once she saw the threat approaching - the ONLY time things started changing was AFTER it was determined that the missile spread wasn't going to work.  Every scenario picked up from that point and diverged.  Which tells me what, precisely?  Exactly what Dylan said - SHE experiences several possible futures as if real, and then chooses which reality she likes best - and SHE can't distinguish one from the next, other than that she chooses one.  <br>
 <br>
Why isn't this a reset button?  We will never see this perspective.  From OUR perspective - what happened is the very last scenario.  And in the ACTUAL timeline - THAT'S what happened!  Here's the problem with this... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Heroic Fool...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> come hoot with triumphant glee here... this necessitates diverging alternate timelines - because the big scary dark thing moving backwards in time really is moving backwards in time - and so all of those realities are actual timelines - somewhere.  Trance's perfect possible future suits exactly one person - Trance.  All of her fellow beings know that there is no such thing as a perfect possible future - all the other miserable, or even not-so-perfect possible futures actually still exist (and they can visit them at any time).  But Trance is a dreamer - she wants to see that perfect possible future...and she is working for it. (Note here that I am referencing one of the all-time worst episodes of RHW Drom ever - IHNAT)<br>
<br>
So, no... Trance isn't evil - she is what we've always seen her to be - an innocent idealistic pixie - who's quest for that perfect possible future has made her grow up a lot, but she clings to that vision the way Dylan clings to his...a good for the sake of good.<br>
<br>
Quite honestly, I really liked seeing this about Trance - I like having my faith in Trance's pixieness restored.  <br>
<br>
So why the sad face?  O.k. Go back and read <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ogami's</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> review.  I pretty much agree with almost everything he said (except the stuff about Trance...).  But during the episode, I simply ignored it.  It has gotten to the point that I've come to expect mediocrity from Drom- plot inconsistencies, crew that make no sense whatsoever (and serve no real function), aliens that have no motivation, science that shoots itself in the foot, and then, dissatisfied, shoots itself in the head...  I'm expecting all of this!  So when Drom delivers on all of these miserable promises - it no longer detracts from the episode - I go on either liking or not liking it on other merits...which, thankfully, Ashley and Zack know how to eek out.  I've realized that my expectations have been lowered so far for Drom that I CAN like this episode, in spite of it all.  <br>
<br>
And that makes me sad.  Well... anyway, Ashley and Zack are leaving after this season, and with them, any concern I might have for the future of Drom - Drom will become just another t.v. show that I don't watch.  So this sad state of affairs will last only 3 more ZackAsh episodes (or if we have high hopes for the GMW episode 4, and I'll throw in the 2-word-titled* MattJoe ep, 5), and then it will be over.<br>

<br>
That's the proper attitude to have, and I've tried to instill that attitude in myself in some episodes that I liked parts of (The Unconquerable Man, Mad to be Saved, etc.). But when an episode doesn't have entertaining bits, and just frenzied heroes running through the corridor to be shot, it's not fun anymore. You're just left with the mediocrity.<br>

I thought the ep was interesting, although the rewind grated after a while.  But just imagine being Trance, and having to rewind millions of times?!? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

(Spoil</span><hr size=1> Maybe this episode is actually an explanation of Trance's name. She looks like she's in a Trance to most everyone a lot of the time, because she's mulling over other possibilities and not really all there. You've heard about ditzes who aren't really all there, maybe in Trance's case this is literally true.<br>
<br>
I fear that any deep discussion on the nature of reality Trance is &quot;selecting&quot; would be far deeper than the writing process that is actually going into this season. For instance, I picture Bob Engels trying to focus on a head of beer, and he says, &quot;Bubbles! Bubbles of time, bubbly bubbly bubbly...&quot;<br>

<br>
But no fair imputing ZackAsh with that... they have turned out the best work this season, and the quality of their work demonstrates rather solidly that the new head writer sucks.  I'm glad that Zack &amp; Ashley are leaving this train wreck behind. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Anyway, I like my Trance theory, and I hope that we see something THIS season that confirms it, since next season is non-existant in my mind...<br>
