I haven't played any computer games in ages.  I don't think I have any of mine currently loaded.  I know I have some like Zork and Myst.  I prefer my Nintendo and I like board games and card games as well.  I also like group type games.  Like the game &quot;Four on a couch&quot; and stuff like that.  I also love stuff like Miniature Golf, Air Hockey, Pool, Ping Pong, Bowling and stuff like that. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

<br>
The Great Underground Empire and all that.<br>
<br>
That was back when 128k of memory in a computer was<br>
pretty good.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
(The book &quot;the Zork Chronicles&quot; is fun for those who ever<br>
played the trilogy.  It's set largely in the GUE.)<br>
<br>
Until I got my connections online all set up, I used to play<br>
a lot of the gaming platform &quot;RPG&quot;s.  (I put that in quotes<br>
because no computer or computer-type game can possibly<br>
account for all the things that can happen in an RPG.)<br>
The Final Fantasy series was always a lot of fun.<br>
I played FF II and III (US versions), and only bought a <br>
Playstation when it was announced FF VII was coming.<br>
I was also one of the people who liked 8.  I've played some<br>
of the others on the SNES and Playstation, also. <br>
<br>
I used to play the tabletop RPGs when I could find other<br>
players.  I ran AD &amp; D in my neighborhood, talked another<br>
guy into running the Star Wars RPG for variety (he had fun,<br>
too), and tried to get someone else to run Toon (the<br>
slapstick cartoon game).  That was before White Wolf's<br>
games pretty much took over (Vampire, Werewolf, et al).<br>
I DID play the Live Action Role Playing (LARP) versions of<br>
Werewolf when I could find the things in NYC.  <br>
(I've given up on attempts to run my own LARP.)<br>
That was a LOT of fun, and my best excuse to dress up.<br>
(My spiffiest photos are from when I played well-dressed<br>
characters.)<br>
<br>
I'm currently avoiding games like &quot;Everquest&quot; because I don't<br>
like the idea of work and sleep interrupting my gaming instead<br>
of the other way around. <br>
<br>
My favourite board game-when I can find people to play it-<br>
is the Star Trek vcr board game.  It's a boardgame where<br>
events onscreen affect what's going on during the game.<br>
(It's also funny to watch even if you don't play.)<br>
=========================================<br>
Peaches, there are many types of games CALLED RPGs.<br>
The oldest type is referred to as &quot;tabletop&quot; RPGs<br>
(RolePlaying Games).  Those involve pencils, paper and<br>
funny-shaped dice.   The most popular ones have included<br>
Dungeons &amp; Dragons (or Advanced D &amp; D), and the<br>
WhiteWolf games (mentioned above).<br>
Playing is by description.  Dice are rolled and compared to<br>
various charts to determine success or failure of various<br>
tasks. (The higher your skill, the more dice, or lower the<br>
number needed to roll.)  <br>
Live Action (LARP) is based on tabletop, but you act it out<br>
instead of describing it.  It's one part RPG, one part <br>
improvisational theater.  (I find it a LOT of fun.) <br>
The ones on game machines (like Final Fantasy) are not<br>
truly RPGs, but are called that.  They retain certain trappings<br>
of games like D &amp; D (combat, magic, experience gains you<br>
levels, which improve your skills), but without the interaction<br>
and flexibility which makes an RPG as fun as it is.<br>
Online ones like Ultima and EverQuest are based on those,<br>
but allow players to have their characters interact.  <br>
(STILL not as flexible as the &quot;old-school&quot; tabletops.<br>
 When HOW you cross a room can have infinite variety, <br>
 you REALLY have options.)<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WordWolf</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I got a free copy of Zork in the mail.  I have no idea which one it is.  I haven't tried it yet.  Maybe in my 'free time' I'll give it a go.  I've played part of FF7 (or was it 8?) but it didn't overly grab me.  I think at the time I just didn't have the time to get into it.<br>
<br>
I love going to the gaming shows (GenCon, RockCon, Little Wars) and playing the games.  There's such a huge variety.  The last one I was at I got into a spin-off of Lord of the Rings.  It was a blast.  But the one that I would've like to watch was some guy set up an Alien one.  He had the foot tall GI Joe's that the players moved.  It looked like it'd be a blast and it sounded like they were having a blast.<br>
<br>
Last summer we also played Desperado.  It was so much fun that we came back and bought some rules and some western figures and started painting them, hopefully being able to play that some day.<br>

The rogue is the stealthiest class on the game. Instead of doing the normal thing, though, and putting an emphasis on dex, int, and cha, you might want to put more of an emphasis on strength then charisma. So something like fifteen in dex, fifteen in strength, and then dump the rest evenly in constitution and intelligence. Go the thief class first, youll want all the extra skill points at the beginning. Then switch to the fighter, and distribute the levels something like 8 for theif and 12 for fighter (you can only get to level twenty in nwn) or maybe you would rather dual to a ranger then a fighter? That has major bonuses, but if you do that, you might consider lowering the intelligence and boosting wisdom, if your concerned with the spells. lol, i talk too much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i know im harping on the thief thing, but you should try it, they are very versatile and a lot of their special abilities are what you sound like you want. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You can ignore the pick pocket and open lock abilities in favor of the stealth abilities, and then dual class to ranger for their extra abilities and higher hit dice!

By the way, dragons in BGII are easy as pie.<br>
You must either have a mage or be a mage, and you must have two things; the ablity to cast some sort of summoning spells, and the spell that removes magic resistance.<br>
Basically, you go into the dragon's room, surround him with your summoned creatures, and then cast your remove resistance spell. He'll then start attacking your creatures (he'll probably kill some, but just keep summoning more as they die). Make sure you have cast at least 3 of the resistance removing spells, then let him have it with direct damage spells, especially magic missle (sometimes not all the resistance will go away, but a few of the missles will hit). If you have more than one party member, you'll finish off the dragon in no time. <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession.
