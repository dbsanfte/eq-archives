But the heck with it - I wanted to get back into reviews, and this seemed like a good place to start. It's not a full &quot;Thoughts On&quot; review. Not yet, but I hope to edit it into one soon. Right now it's just some first impressions.<br>
<br>
Just when we thought it was safe to turn on the TV, Bob Engles has come back through his dimensional tunnel, and he brought the Derivas with him. Right from the start when I saw that damned cat, I knew that &quot;Delenda Est&quot; wouldn't be one of Andromeda's best episodes.<br>
<br>
This is the second (or maybe third) episode in the Deriva arc, and it's not quite as bad as &quot;If The Wheel Is Fixed,&quot; but it's not great either. Apparently the Andromeda has been targeted for Deriva attack once again (no explanation as to how they opened their tunnel this time), or maybe the ship just wandered into a random Deriva invasion. (This seems more likely, since other ships have been attacked before Andromeda.) The invaders signal their presence by screwing around with the ship's systems, except this time they can't seem to do anything worse than the occasional prank with the video screens. Oh, and there's the little black holes. Or mini-tunnels.<br>
<br>
Apparently you can close mini-tunnels by shooting effectors at them. Dylan knew this instantly, but I have no idea how he figured it out.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Rommie &quot;explores the concept of revenge&quot; by ignoring orders and going after the Derivas. The black leathery aliens kidnap her and disappear into a mini-tunnel. But Rommie has a locator beacon implanted somewhere inside her, so Dylan, Beka and Tyr jump in the Maru and go on a rescue mission. (Apparently the aliens tunneled to an invisible ship nearby, but none of this is mentioned in the dialog.) Trance shoots at a Deriva ship, misses, and the aliens go bye bye.<br>
<br>
But wait! All is not lost, for Andromeda has picked up some kind of whacky emissions from an &quot;M Class Planet,&quot; and Rommie's transmitter is also there. So Tyr and Dylan get in their vipers - sorry, Slipfighters - and go on a rescue mission. Harper and Trance hunt for alien stowaways, Beka deals with her supressed sexuality (or something, I wasn't really paying attention by this point), everybody gets to shoot stupid pop-up Derivas in a big old video game, and a planet blows up.<br>
<br>
The Derivas wanted Rommie to &quot;focus the plasma below&quot; on their weird planet, or something, so they could use its energy to open another tunnel. Yawn.<br>
<br>
Then a Deriva shows up on the command deck just when you thought they were gone (yeah, right) and surrenders a dagger to Dylan, before dying. Maybe that means the Deriva arc is over and we'll never have to see this kind of horse-puckey again. Or maybe it's supposed to be cryptic. Or something.<br>
<br>
If the paragraphs above sound kind of boring to you... well, you're right. They're boring because this episode is boring. It's all formula  - start with a puzzle, put the characters in jeopardy, throw in a puzzle, put the characters in jeopardy, throw in a puzzle, put the characters in jeopardy, etc, etc, etc. It's bang, bang, bang, like a standup comedy routine, but without the jokes. The pacing is mechanical and lazy, with long stretches of dead air where the characters just stand around and watch weird things happen. In &quot;If The Wheel Is Fixed,&quot; the plot was so elaborately hidden it almost wasn't there, but in this episode the plot is obvious and trivial. Bad aliens steal Rommie to futher their Evil plans. Dylan and company stop them. The end.<br>
<br>
The dialog is actually quite a bit better this time out. Or at least, Dylan, Beka and Harper sound more or less like themselves. (Beka is the best one here, and she has a few lines that are funny.) Tyr isn't quite as looney in &quot;Delenda Est&quot; as he was in ITWIF (no lines about Dylan being &quot;the Leper of the Solar System,&quot; alas), but he still acts like a man who lost more than just his bone spurs in that tunnel. (Do the Derivas keep them in a jar?) Rommie seems to be rather sulky and terse, like she's just marking time until the next episode, and Andromeda is totally lobotomized. The least convincing character though (aside from Andromeda), is Trance. Poor Trance was her old mysterious, charming self just last week in &quot;The Unconquerable Man,&quot; but in this ep she's been possessed by the drunken spirit of Thoth Amon, or something equally demented. She goes on about not remembering the Derivas even though she's seen them before, and other strange rambling digressions, killing aliens left and right (What happened to the girl who loved all living things?), while the rest of the crew pointedly try not to notice her non-sequiturs. Trance needs help. Maybe an intervention?<br>
<br>
All in all, this episode wasn't great. It was better than ITWIF, but that's not exactly high praise. It's mindless action for the most part, with the &quot;mystery&quot; of the idiotic Derivas there to keep continuity alive. Or something.<br>
<br>
Please, Mr. Engles. If you don't want to write Andromeda scripts, leave them alone. Let someone else with a passion for science fiction handle these stories.<br>
<br>
I want Andromeda back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heroicfool>HeroicFool</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#0000FF, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='user title'>Triumvir</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 1148<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/2/03 9:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/angelwings/fhfx104.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Thoughts On Ep. 311: Delenda Est (Spoilers)</span><hr size=1> Man...<br>

<br>
Very well stated, I'm glad you're doing episode reviews. Bob did indeed come through the Tunnel, and he brought this script with him.<br>
<br>
One pictures a bunch of yes men at the office saying &quot;You're the greatest writer, Bob! Can you write even more episodes of Andromeda?&quot; Never mind that the ratings tanked thanks to his brain-dead third season premiere, he just coasts along while others get the blame and get sacked. At least we know the universe is unfair in our timeline.<br>
<br>

<br>
See, that's what people like Lil don't understand when I say I had fun watching parts of this episode. It's not quite as bad as Wheel. I never said it was great writing, or even first season quality. It's good for a third season episode, and that says many things on many levels. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I know this is a Roddenberry show, but &quot;Class M&quot; is a Star Trek concept. Why on earth would the Commonwealth use the same reference? Why not &quot;Class A&quot;?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bad aliens steal Rommie to futher their Evil plans. Dylan and company stop them. The end.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The deeper plot isn't all that deep. Bob Engels liked the idea of somebody tying up Rommie, perhaps he wrote this episode in his bathrobe, I don't know. And here we have the result. I have to give him the benefit of a doubt, for what else purpose could this episode have served?<br>
<br>
For the record I viscerally enjoyed the scenes of Rommie strongarming Harper and tossing around aliens, not her scene of being trussed up. But I guess we now know what floats Bob Engels' boat. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Trance needs help. Maybe an intervention?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I would like one character in an episode to ask Trance the obvious question: You, Gold Trance, are from the future. Cyborg Beka was from the future. Cyborg Beka went away after we solved whatever problem brought her into existence. Why are you still here? Where is purple tailed Trance?<br>
