Clauses 1 and 2 should be incorporated in 1.<br>
What we should think about: What do we want to gain from relations? What do we hope for?<br>
<br>
Section II<br>
3.  Nations must not act through war with other nations unless it is for their own defence. So wed recognize almost all nations, after we get to know them a bit. Nations we would not recognize are out breakers unless the mother-nation recognizes the outbreaking. If mother nation is dead we can recognize the out breaker nation (e.g. Baracão).  For an example if Babkha was experiencing a coup détat, and the Republic of Shahzamin asked for our recognition we would give it unless a) we get to know them, b) Babkha recognizes them (as the case with Ayllu)<br>
Anything else?<br>
<br>
4. Recognition can/should be terminated if a nation unprovoked attacks our nation or another nation. And if the nation plants coups or supports terrorist organizations/activities.  Recognition shall also be terminated if a nation stops recognizing us (as it was with Shireroth)<br>
Any further ideas?<br>
<br>
5. Types of Recognition<br>
Just 2 would work for me, allies and friends. Friends are all nations we have peaceful relations with and allies when we co-operate in defensive and/or political activities.<br>
<br>
Section III<br>
6. A foreign representative is a person who officially speaks on behalf of a nation in Menelmacar. Menelmacar reserves the right to decline a foreign representative; all foreign representatives must be accepted by the Foreign Edification (except for Heads of States, Governments and Foreign Ministers)<br>
<br>
7. Our ambassadors are the only people authorized to speak on behalf of the Menelmacari People. They will be assigned a country where they will act as the Menelmacari Representative. Communiqués/letters/statements of minor status/importance from a representative of Menelmacar will have to be accepted by the Foreign Edification, of major status/importance by the Conclave.<br>
<br>
Section IV<br>
8. *shrugs* <br>
9. Menelmacar could join any organization really, if the Conclave accepts. As long as it doesnt mean that the organization would have any legal authority over us theyre good. If an organization wishes to have legal authority over its members or we join one who has, we would have to put an extra clause in the Government Paper explaining that authority. That means a 3/5 amendment<br>
<br>
10, 11, 12. Menelmacari diplomats in International Organizations/Conventions would on minor issues have to ask the Foreign Edification for their opinion. On major issues, such as a new constitution for an organization, the Conclave will have the last word.<br>
International treaties must be verified by the Conclave before they are adapted in Menelmacar.<br>
<br>
Section V<br>
13. If a nation threatens Menelmacar the Menelmacari Foreign Edification will issue a protest. A counter threat must be accepted by the Conclave of Equals. If a nation attacks Menelmacar through destruction (hacking, spamming, bombs, timebombs), the Foreign Edification will advice the Administrator to temporarily ban the attackers and put the forums on MBA. The Foreign Edification will issue a protest to the attacker nation, either directly or in case we are banned from their community, through a recognized nation of ours we trust.<br>
The Conclave of Equals can if the attacks are severe declare war through a 3/5 vote.  The Menelmacari Police will conduct warfare.<br>
<br>
14. <br>
If there is an unknown attacker on Menelmacar, the Administrator is ordered to put the Forums on MBA, and all applicants shall be shown and discussed.  Menelmacari Police will order an Investigation of the attacks and bring the attackers to justice<br>
<br>
15. If a known terrorist organization, measures are the same as if unknown individuals attack. An investigation shall be ordered.<br>
<br>
Section VI<br>
16. If a recognized nation gets attacked, Menelmacar will offer her sympathies (lol that sounds bad). This needs further debate<br>
<br>
17. Coups détats needs also to be debated.<br>
<br>
This is at no way the agenda, only my ideas. Lets discuss them further!<br>

<br>
For the purpose of expanding the minds of our nations citizens to brothers and sisters elsewhere in the Micro-national world.  That both nations will benefit from cultural exchange and friendship.<br>
<br>
Section II<br>
3. We will not reconize or form relations with a nation who is bent on warmongering.  A nation who has performed Terror, hacking, cracking, bombing, or has employed any other micronational weapon will not be reconized by the Imperium. If said nation makes policy shifts from such behavior he may be reconized by the Imperium after three months of peace and friendship with the nations neighbors.<br>
<br>
If a nation is created by a rebel faction taking over the mother nations forums, or by said nation hijacking the nations boards it will not be reconized.  Reconigtion for such a nation will only occur if the mother nation reconizes the daughter nation.  If the split of is agreed by both parties peacefully and diplomatically then we may reconize the nation on a case by case basis.  Nations who put on a charade rebellion, revolution, or coup may be reconized as normal once they become stable. <br>
<br>
4. Recognition of a nation will be terminated automatically if the other nation stops recognition of our nation.  If a nation supports terrorist organizations or actions said nation will be dealt with by a vote in the conclave on a case by case basis to terminate relations.  If a nation attacks us it will automatically lose recognition from us.  If a nation supports or recognizes nations whom are formed through coups, rebellions, and unpopular uprising will be dealt with on a case by case basis in the Conclave.<br>
<br>
5. The types of recognition are as follows.  Friends, mutual recognition, and allies.  A friend is a nation who has not entered into a mutual recognition treaty but has began friendly diplomatic relations.  Mutual recognition is when both nations agree to reconize each other as a micro-nation.  Allies are nations who have entered into an alliance of any kind.<br>
<br>
<br>
Section III<br>
6. A foreign representative is a person who officially speaks on behalf of a their nation in Menelmacar. Menelmacar reserves the right to decline a foreign representative; all foreign representatives must be accepted by the Conclave of Equals.<br>
<br>
7. An ambassador is authorized to enter into friendly relations with another nation.  He is limited in that any mutual recognition, treaties must be passed through the Conclave of Equals.  His main purpose is to gather information, and cultural knowledge, and political affiliations of a nation, to present in the Foreign Edification forum to educate Menelmacari Citizens. An Ambassador may only offer comminque's pertaining to friendship, not mutual recognitions, or treaties.  <br>
<br>
Section IV<br>
8.  <br>
9. Menelmacar may not join any organization who's powers would extend over the Imperium of Menelmacar.  Menelmacar's status as a soveriegn micronation may not be threatened, or broken by any organization.  Organizations that do not affect Menelmacar's internal policy may be joined by vote in the Conclave of Equals<br>
<br>
10, 11, 12. Menelmacari Ambassadors if ever given admittance to Internal Organizations or major conventions may not act independetly.

This is my suggestions on what you had written so far.  I completely re-wrote what you had listed because I didn't care for what you had written so far.  Not only that you where giving Foreign Ambassadors more authority then they have been granted by the Conclave of Equals, and government documents.  I like what I have written sof ar if someone wants to add to it I'd be happy to look at it.  The number/etc is obviouslly not correct.<br>
