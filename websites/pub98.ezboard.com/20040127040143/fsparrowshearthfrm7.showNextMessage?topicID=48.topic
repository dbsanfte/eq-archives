Gothic now means dark and evil, I wonder if any of the &quot;Goths&quot; have ever seen a beatiful white Gothic tower gracing the skylines of a medieval city. <br>
<br>
Who cares what the Satanists think. If they want to do their thing on Halloween, fine by me. It doesn't detract from the fact that it is the eve of the feast of all the holy, all the Saints. My faith isn't so weak as to worry about boggy-men around every corner.<br>
<br>
And by the way, you got it backwards. Priests didn't force anyone to do anything. That would be quite an accomplishment. Halloween grew naturally out of the prior feasts of honouring the dead. God forbid that a pagan custom should be modified to fit with Christian celebrations and liturgy. Halloween has been baptized just like Christmas, just like Easter, just like Corpus Christi/Midsummer, just like Plato for Augustine, just like Aristotle for Aquinas. It has been &quot;Christianized&quot; just like any number of other traditional celebrations.<br>

Its the biggest night for many satan worshippers, pagans, etc and that's not something I personally care to be associated with. I think society has watered everything down so much that we accept evil as something good and do it anyway, rationalizing our way out of it. Just my thoughts.&gt;<br>
<br>
That's the wonderful thing about all this, we each get to choose how to handle it. (I LOVE Romans 14!)<br>
<br>
I figure, when at Christmas, some are only using it as an excuse to get presents and have a party, or on Easter, when we're rejoicing that our Lord is not just some dead nice guy, and other are merely using it as another excuse for a party and new dress.. I'm using Halloween for the same. There is no overtones of any evil at our family gatherings. And those there are believers. If it IS truly &quot;satanic&quot;, then he's got to be cringing when we're saying grace, and praying for the safety of all the little ones out getting candy. OUR Halloween has nothing to do with evil.. only another excuse for a party and family gathering with some of us putting on silly costumes. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Thanks to the internet we have a lot of knowledge available but it takes time to sort it out. I did dig into this subject as deeply as I could. It took several months to get to what appears to be the bottom of it, and it looks to me like Halloween, though confused today, was originally observed or remembered as the probable date of the flood. If this is correct, it began with Noah and/or his children or thereabouts and was a remembrance of what God did to a wicked world rather than an honoring of the dead who perished in the flood. <br>

I picked out some of the highlights, but I linked to the site so you can check it out yourself.  This is thoroughly documented, and the sources are accurate, so I think it has some merit.  It was written by a preacher, Dennis Rupert, pastor of New Life Community church of Stafford.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Folk tradition tells us of some divination practices associated with Samhain... Ducking for apples was a marriage divination. The first person to bite an apple would be the first to marry in the coming year -- like the modern toss of the wedding bouquet.<br>
<br>
Contrary to information published by many Christian organizations, there is no historical or archeological evidence of any Celtic deity of the dead named &quot;Samhain.&quot; <br>
<br>
Contrary to Christian criticism from many sources, Halloween did not originate as a Satanic festival, but was religious in nature (of course, the religion I am referring to is the Celtic faith of the ancient Druids rather than Christianity). This is an important distinction, for Halloween’s association with Satanic worship is a modern phenomenon. The Celts didn't worship the devil (or any god of death) on Halloween.<br>
<br>
Celts were pagans, not Satanists. Of course, from a Christian standpoint both are in error. But to my mind there is a major difference between pagans (who have not heard the gospel) practicing a holiday containing fairies and elves and Satanists (in rebellion against God) who sacrifice children to the devil. There is no original evidence to indicate that Samhain was any more Satanic than pagan harvest festivals of other religions, like the Romans or the Greeks. <br>
<br>
...there is absolutely NO historical evidence of costumed begging until a much later time (Christian times) and these costumed processions were NOT limited to just Halloween. The earliest actual historic practice seems to have been poor folk in masks and costumes going from house to house and putting on a simple play or musical performance in return for food and drink. This practice is called mumming or guising. This is a long way from the evil Druids killing people who didn't contribute &quot;to their demonic worship celebration&quot;!<br>
<br>
The origins of Halloween are NOT what most Christian literature teaches. Sorry, no pumpkins with candles of human fat! Sorry, no human sacrifices by evil druids. Sorry, dressing up can't be historically connected to the Celts. Sorry, treat-or-treat is not a Satanist plot to captivate our children.<br>
<br>
How did witches become connected to Halloween? Once the Druids were branded as evil by the church, their practices were looked at as &quot;witchcraft.&quot; Followers of the old religion were persecuted, went into hiding, and were branded as witches who worshipped Satan. This is why European witchcraft became connected with Satan, whereas witchcraft in other areas of the world is animistic in nature. October 31 became known as a witch holiday. It was called &quot;The Witches' Sabbath&quot; by witch hunters and eventually European witches began celebrating October 31 as one of their four great Sabbaths held during the year.<br>
<br>
In 835 Pope Gregory IV decided to move the practice of All Saints' Day to November 1. This was possibly done to correspond with the Celtic practice of Samhain.<br>
<br>
The powerful symbolism of fairies, elves, and the traveling dead had a strong tie with the people and they were not satisfied with the new Catholic feast honoring saints. When people continued some of the beliefs and practices associated with Samhain, the church increased the rhetoric against Samhain. They branded the earlier religion's practices as evil, and began to associate them with the devil. As representatives of the rival religion, Druids were considered evil worshippers of devilish or demonic gods and spirits. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Though it might be fun reading, just as KKK literature might be fun reading, I think that most likely anyone who takes it seriously has some serious psychological issues.<br>
<br>
But as I said earlier, most of the problems arrise from the Fundamentalist confusion of pagan and Satanist, as if all pagans are inspired devil worshippers.  It is little wonder why reformed style Christianity has had almost no successes in converting people from animist religions in Asia, Africa and the Americas (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/116/53.0.html">www.christianitytoday.com.../53.0.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ; <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/packages/iraq/globe_stories/042003_mission.htm">www.boston.com/news/packa...ission.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ). True they are able to frequently convert Catholics/Orthodox but seldom non-Christians. I recall this issue arrising with Protestant evangelists going to Iraq recently and actually targeting Chaldean Catholics for conversion rather than Muslims. The Catholic notion of natural law (natural theology) is beneficial in understanding the origins of these non-Christian religions. Rather than being Devil inspired religions they are expressions of peoples' longing for the divine though imperfect because of faulty mythology, erroneous reason and a lack of revelation. <br>
<br>
Likely the best site on the net for disproving the Druidic connection to Halloween (and frequently evaluating the anti-Catholic basis of most of the fundamentalist propoganda about it) is: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.illusions.com/halloween/hallows.htm">www.illusions.com/halloween/hallows.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

catch a common theme that brushed 2 of them.<br>
<br>
It was common practice back when to claim the other guy's<br>
religion practiced human sacrifice. <br>
<br>
It was claimed of early Christians, and when they &quot;came to<br>
power&quot; in Europe, they turned and did the same of others.<br>
<br>
About the Celts, I don't think we know enough about them<br>
to know for sure-they MIGHT have had one a year or <br>
something, like the Aztecs.  I've heard things along those<br>
lines, but I never followed up on them.  <br>
<br>
One of the things that makes this difficult is that various<br>
authorities at various times slapped on various accusations<br>
on outsiders, in order to point to them as an external threat<br>
to validate their own power.    It's an ancient strategy:<br>
 loose a lion in the streets,  wait until panic ensues, save<br>
the people from the lion, and they look to you for <br>
leadership.    That's one reason all the &quot;confessions&quot; of the<br>
Inquisition sounded the same-they were scripted by the<br>
Inquisitors, and eventually the &quot;confessor&quot; learned what to<br>
confess to.   Then all these identical confessions were shown<br>
as proof of some demonic or cultic conspiracy.<br>
<br>
So, many beliefs ended up getting mixed up, making it <br>
difficult to discern the true origins.<br>
<br>
The story I heard about &quot;Jack O'Lantern&quot; goes as follows:<br>
(Making it a post-Christian story)<br>
There was a man called Jack who was a real villain. He even<br>
cheated the devil once.<br>
Anyway, so one day he dies. <br>
Heaven won't take him, and the devil refuses him because<br>
he's holding a grudge.  <br>
So, Jack is forced to wander the earth, with his lantern<br>
he made out of a turnip or something. (Pumpkins were too<br>
expensive.)<br>
I don't know if that's the real story.<br>
<br>

I take the Satanists as seriously as I take the Heaven's Gate cults. Gothic now means dark and evil, I wonder if any of the &quot;Goths&quot; have ever seen a beatiful white Gothic tower gracing the skylines of a medieval city. <br>
<br>
Who cares what the Satanists think. If they want to do their thing on Halloween, fine by me. It doesn't detract from the fact that it is the eve of the feast of all the holy, all the Saints. My faith isn't so weak as to worry about boggy-men around every corner.&quot;<br>
<br>
No Adam, I don't care at all about what satanists think. I have no idea where you got that notion from. You completely misunderstood what I was trying to say. I don't appreciate you taking a crack at my faith either, that's really uncalled for.<br>
I'm not worried about any boogy men. Again, I don't know where you got that notion from. <br>
<br>
My point had been that its important for Christians to be careful what they do and don't do because those that are not Christians are always watching and that's part of our witness to others. <br>
<br>
I guess its how you're brought up or what doctrine you come from and how you personally feel about it when it comes right down to it. <br>
<br>
Again, I had hoped the original thread would be deleted but as the quotes still exist, well, it was a bit pointless so oh well. I guess I have to live with it. I'd just appreciate people not taking cracks at my faith or being rude or abraisive. Thank you. <p><font size="-2">

For the most part, I do agree with you.  But I find that Christians from all walks draw the lines at certain things while not thinking twice about something else.<br>

I still think about some Christians who totally disavow the use of playing cards because they were derived from the Tarot.<br>
<br>
There are also Christians who don't dance, seeing as that action can be viewed as overly sexual.<br>

No matter how much you protest, it was you who initiated this coversation by linking Halloween to priests forcing Christians to accept Satan-worship in not so many words.  Since you insisted that you have studied this topic ad nauseum, I am here calling your bluff.  I don't concider Jack Chick and Bob Jones University BS scholarship (some might be inclined to think BS stands for Bad Scholarship...but I don't think their publications are worthy of the title &quot;scholarship&quot;). Earlier I posted a couple of sites completely disproving your Satanist/Druid connection. As for what the Satanists think, you seem to have some pathological fear of celebrations coinciding with one another (along with a not so latent anti-clericalism and anti-Catholicism). Besides, is Satanists do celebrate on Halloween (or if they celebrate at all), it was they who stole the holiday from the Catholics and not vice-versa.<br>
<br>
As for cracks at your faith...since when do I need to tolerate ignorant opinions when they are presented as conclusions? You not so subtlely tried to pass off your anti-Catholicism as scholarship but when it was proven wrong, you decided to have the thread errased most likely to avoid embarrassement. And somehow I am taking cracks at your faith.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I'd just appreciate people not taking cracks at my faith or being rude or abraisive.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I understand, it is okay for you to voice your opinions about priests and such, but to expose your opinions as erroneous is concidered &quot;taking cracks at your faith and being rude and abraisive.&quot;  If you don't want me to &quot;take cracks&quot; at your faith, then I would suggest changing your faith.  Though I cannot be certain your exact &quot;faith&quot;, it seems that your version of Christianity (like all fundamentalist Christianity) is rooted in anti-Catholicism and American nativism. From this has developed an irrational fear of anything remotely Catholic, Irish or Italian and everything with any pre-Christian associations is deemed Satanic (as if all non-Christians are Satan worshippers).<br>
<br>
How is this for reduction ad absurdum: Nazis think Jews are subhuman, but to attack that notion is &quot;taking cracks at the Nazi faith&quot;.<br>

I won't be back to this forum again if this is how you are about sharing thoughts and opinions on spiritual matters. I had no problem with anything else anyone had to say when they disagreed with me becuse it was how they said it. Perhaps you should learn to choose your words more carefully (as I think we all should do).<br>
<br>
 As for studies and research, there are tons of things out there that support what I had originally said, and tons of things that support what you say. So then fine, you're smarter than me. Fine you're right. Fine, you're the say all and be all authority on this topic. I'm not fond of kneejerk reactions like yours and I'll just let you have the last assumption, er..word on me, my beliefs, anything you brought up. Whatever you'd like to call it. There are much more polite and respectful ways of communicating and disagreeing with someone. Continue to be as dogmatic as you like... me? I'm done with this and out of here. The moderators can do whatever they see fit to do. I shouldn't have to come to a place like this and worry about having false accusations drawn against me. <br>
<br>
I would like to thank everyone else though for sharing their thoughts and opinions kindly, respectfully, and in a very adult and Christian fashion. Its very appreciated. Thank you.<br>

I never wanted to have to use that here.<br>
<br>
Ok, I'm imposing the 24 hour lockdown here.<br>
<br>
I've had enough.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Adam</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, your an intelligent guy and I respect you knowledge and ability to hold your own - I've seen you do it with one of the tougher debaters on the net.  Sparrow's Hearth ain't that other board.  Your last post WAS over the top for this place.  Even if the slight is unintentional, I will still call it a slight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Klandagi</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, I'm sorry you feel the way you do.  Please don't think this is normal for this message board as I can assure you it is not.  I locked the thread because your last post likely would have fanned the flames from its sarcastic tone.<br>
<br>
Basically, I want the two of you to cool down over the next 24 hours.  Remember the fact that BOTH of you are Christians.  I expect you treat each other as such when here next.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
Thread will be re-opened by 10:30 pm EST Wednesday, November 5, 2003. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man.<br>
