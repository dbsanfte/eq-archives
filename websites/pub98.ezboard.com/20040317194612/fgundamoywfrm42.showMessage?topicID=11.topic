Bio:<br>
Born into a wealthy family my father was head of R&amp;D of a MS factory on side 1 so I grew up with all the things a Spacenoid or as I have come to know myself a child of the stars could want, friends, a beautiful girl, and a family that loved me as I them. It was about two years ago that this all came to a end and I joined Zeon but I wasn't always like this, I didn't always hate Earthnoids or the Federation/Union as they are called now, I guess you could say I was raised on war, but their was a time when I though my life wouldn't go beyond the colony I was happy with my peaceful life... hmm you know when I lay here in my suites power down sitting here in the dark and quite surrounded by the cold chill of space I can still remember it all as if I were still their. The war had just broken out was 11 at the time and didn't really understand what was going on, but my father seemed to along with my older brother. As my father threw his support behind Degin Zabi and my brother went off to join the Zeon army, I still remember the last thing he told me before going off. &quot;Hey squirt, I'm going off now to fight for what I believe in, and for our freedom. I'm going to fight this war and do the best I can to win, in the hopes that you never have to live your life under the control of another. Remember Matt never let anyone stand in the way of your dreams. Theirs my shuttle, so... I guess this is goodbye baby bro, and don't forget keep out of my room or else hahaha&quot; Two months later my mother received a letter saying he was K.I.A. My mother cry for a long time after that and would sneak into my room to watch me sleep almost ever night, my father was furies yet heart broken he made some calls and found out that my brother was part of a operation which took place on another colony in which they were looking for a new type of Federation Gundam. Seems this Gundam was more than they had thought and all unites were lost. The lose of my brother didn't really sink in at first until one day I went into his room, thinking he'd come in any minute and trash me...but he didn't and he never will, I fell onto his bed and cried for I don't know how long, until my hand grazed something under his pillow. It was a small piece of gold metal with insignia of Zeon on it, it was his ensign bars from when he graduated from the military school, and looking at them I remember how proud he was when he got them. I put them on and wore them everywhere to keep my brother with me always in this way. Reading up on designs and weapons systems for Mobiles suites seemed to please my father greatly as I would ask for more on suites and their systems and how they worked. The war went on and I kept up my studies along with my quest on mobile suites, by the time I was 12 the war had reached space and things were looking bad for Zeon. My father still believed the war could be one if only he could come up with a better suite a more powerful suite, so always he would be in his work room with me by his side taking in everything he did, until one night their was a blast that felt like the whole colony had moved, fire was everywhere as the emergency air lock doors started to close I remember running out to see a lone Zaku II fighting off two RGM-79's which I knew from the work my father had been doing on enemy suites. The pilot of the Zaku fought bravely and managed to disable one the GM's but when a third GM surprised him from behind he fell no more than 100 yards from where our house was choking on the dust I watched as my mother and the maid rushed out to try and help the pilot inside but just before they could reach the Zaku a intense beam of red tore threw armor of the suite like it was paper, the heat from the beam blinded my mother and would have killed her if the maid wouldn't have pulled her back at the last second. My mother wasn't the same after that and the days that followed were like a living nightmare as Federation soldiers arrested my father for adding the Zeon in the war against Earth. Even as my father was locked away and my mother and I forced to live in a shabby house barely getting by since they took all my father wealth &quot;To help rebuild what WE destroyed on Earth.&quot; still I pushed on in his work I was so young but I had a passion to free my father and avenge my brothers death, but sadly before I was able to do any of this things the war was over and thou so many people were happy, I somehow felt cheated. A few months later my father was released and was allowed to return to work and soon after had saved enough for us to be back on our feet. As the years pasted my father became good friends with a man called Delaz, many nights they would sit together and talk of how things would be different if the colonies could govern themselves and sometimes I would sit in and listen. By now I was working at my fathers factory with designs part time, I had always met Sandrenia my angel at a local store where she was working part time, the first time I saw here I had to look twice to make sure I wasn't dreaming and for a short time I forgot all about Zeon and avenging my family it didn't matter as long as I had her in my life I was happy, we used to always go to the corner ice cream shop and talk about everything in fact that's where I first heard the voice of Delaz over the mic. and I can't say that a smile didn't grow on my face as I thought it was time, I could really do my part this time, but Sandrenia wouldn't let me lie about my age and join and I could bear the look on her face nothing so beautiful should ever look so sad. So I worked night and day on MS designs and pulling old ideas out to make them better, faster, stronger. Sadly again I was denied as the war was quickly over with the assignation of Delaz, but some of the fleet had made it into deep space away from the Union fleet thou they were hunted like animals by the group known as the Titans. It was U.C. 0085 I was 17 that I attended along with my Sandrenia my father and mother a peaceful rally against the actions of the Titans the protest held about 500,000 people when all of a sudden several shuttles hovered over head and started to release a sick green cloud down onto the crowed all the screaming a running I can still feel Sandrenia's hand slip from mine as I was pulled down by others fighting to escape the gas, I thought to myself to let it all end here and now as the gas grew closer and closer but my father grabbed me up and shook me back and handed me a envelope and almost forced me down into a man hole that led away from the city and he told me of a old fall out shelter I would be safe at. I can't remember how long I ran in the dark following the twist and turns of the tunnels but even under all the steel and concert I could still hears the screams of those above me, or maybe it was just my mind screaming not knowing what was going on. I finally made it to the shelter and locked myself inside clenching the envelop my father had given me as I pushed myself into a corner. A day, a week, a month went by before anyone found me. Thirty million people were killed....murdered for being spacenoids, I sat in the hospital for another week gaining my strength back then one day a nurse brought me the envelope that was found with me, I had almost forgotten about it, the nurse left me as I tore the envelop open and read the letter which I still keep as they are the last words of my father. It told me of a abandon factory and that under it was a secret manufacturing plant where the S.Gouf II custom was being built, the letter continued on about the return of Zeon, and where I could find them. The end of the letter read how he was proud of the man I was becoming and how he wished me the best of luck on my road ahead no matter where it run. I put the letter away and left that very moment not wanted to waste anymore time waiting around here. I gathered my things and took a shuttle to the edge of where the factory laid, it wasn't long before I was standing in front of it or what was left of the factory since it was destroyed during the war, as I looked around the wreckage I found the secret elevator shaft that took me further and further down and I had noticed the tempter had dropped to almost freezing before the elevator stopped. I walked on down the dimly lit hallway but the was wasn't long as I entered a large hanger that was pitch black until I tripped the auto light which filled the room with a eerie blue glow and that when I got my fist glimpse of the S.Gouf custom III, I was shivering at the sight of it. It stood 20 meters tall, with a dark metallic color to it at first I thought it was black paint but later found it was just the after effect of Gundarium and Ultra dense Titanium blending together to form the Armor, on it's left arm instead of a hand was a razor sharp claw of four, three on top one on bottom they glowed a sick blue as they were charged with a faint pulse of energy that added to tearing through a enemies Armor could also short some of their electronics if the strike was placed right the claw could always be shot a med. distance and retracted back with a forceful pull ripping back anything it grapples onto, on the forearm was a thick shield with a drum of ammo at the top and a gatling gun at the base also behind the shield were two rockets with ultra dense titanium which had 4x the normal punch of large bazooka rounds, on the shield was the gold Zeon crest. The left claw had a narrow yet long rectangle hole right above the wrist on the forearm which concealed a dark energy blade much like that of the gundam equal in power but shorter in range. On it's back was a DOM heat rod but larger in size and more of a point at the end as it could be used for long range attacks if need be. Standing their I no longer felt the cold in fact I welcomed it as I placed my hand on the cold metal I knew the name as if it had called out to me I would call her Sandrenia, she would be my angel of death, spread the icy grip of her cold hand around anyone's throat that stood in my way. With that I opened the hatch and climbed in, it was the perfect fit the two of us, I knew most of her controls since I helped my father with the design, I started her up and listen to the soft hum of her Ultra compact Minovsky Fusion Reactor come to life. I reached into my side pocket and pulled out my brothers bars and placed them on my inner collar and opened the hanger doors and blasted off towards my future. <br>
Now were back to the now a new war rages on which is not really new since its still the old flames of a forgot war which will not be....*beepbeepbeepbeep* *flip* &quot;Sandrenia, it seems we have guest, save and turn off journal U.C.0088. We have company to attend to.&quot; <br>
