I am huge on freedom of (and for) religion, even some things many would be against like using marijuana and polygamy amongst adults. The point at which these activities impact others, however is where it gets sticky--particularly with innocent children who have no choice in the matter.<br>
<br>
Circmcision of female infants is illegal in the US for good reason. Unfortunately, there is a double standard for boys and this unnecessary, dangerous and extremely painful procedure is commonplace here, even though only 18% of the world's males are circumcised. Mostly this is done for religious and cultural reasons that revolve around reducing or eliminating sexual pleasure do decrease masturbation and infidelity....yup--even here in the US where the Catholic church started the campaign to circ boys. Interestingly, the Pope is not circumcised. I find this practice more repugnant and inexcusable the more I research it and though I don't know how we can outlaw what the bible commands be done to small children, it is definitely mutilation and it's a real shame.<br>
<br>
Not providing medical treatment is tricky since neglect is punishable here. Is a woman who makes her child die a tortuos death without treatment or pain medication better than a crack whore who's child is just left to die due to malnutrition or lack of medical treatment since mom needs the money for drugs and is out of it? And what about the danger my children are in let's say at school from these children who's parents refuse to immunize? If it's okay to allow a child to die from neglect and make her think it is because she is not devout enough, then what are the implications for our other laws around child abuse and neglect? Should medicare pay for &quot;care centers&quot; where no medical care is actually given, rather just prayers are said? <br>
<br>
The driver's license thing is easy. This is not a right, rather a privelege and the woman could easily have her picture taken maybe in a facility by another woman in a booth for more privacy. I work at a fab where not wearing your bunny suit is not an option and we provide private dressing rooms for Muslim and other women who wear dresses to work and wish to gown in private. If this is not acceptable, they would not take the job...same thing with driving.<br>
<br>
On the other hand I don't think a majority religion, like xianity should infringe on laws and the personal beliefs of people like gays who wish to marry in secular ceremonies or adopt children or those who want to marry more than one man or woman. If noone is getting hurt or being abused, it's tough to say it should be disallowed or restricted. We must also distinguish between forced or coerced things like using tax money to support religious activity and making rules around things like licenses that are priveleges.<br>

I think everyone has different ideas of what god commands. <br>
<br>
Circumcision I personally think is wrong. I have no idea why you want to cut a piece of your Childs body off. All of my friends have their boys circumcised not for religious reasons but for sheer vanity (i.e. I want my son to look like his father). So I tend to think most people use the guise of god but really do it out of vanity.<br>
<br>
The whole denial of medical attention rings very close to home. I was raised JW they don’t believe in blood transfusions. My youngest brother had a severe birth defect that required him to have brain surgery. My mom and my dad would not allow him to have transplant. The doctors only gave him a 10 percent chance at life. Luckily he lived due to some experimental procedures.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think in this country people still treat their children as property. I also think people have kids just procreate with no thought of what bringing a life in to the world entails.<br>
<br>
I have a hard time because I am a huge advocate of people’s rights. What does bother me is that the old and young (children) are not given the same rights.<br>
<br>
Now that I have gone off on a little tangent I will shut up.<br>

<br>
That's a tough question to answer.  Jesus sacrificed his own physical life in persuit of a religious goals.  MLK knew he would likely be assisinated, yet he continued his struggle for equality, and relied upon his faith in God as being &quot;more important&quot; than physical safety.  Would you have prevented either of them from persuing their goals only because it was physically dangerous?  I don't think I could honestly do that.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Health care - should parents be allowed to refuse medical treatment for their children if it goes against their beliefs?<br>
<br>
IMO, no.  The physical well being of the child should be more important than a religious belief.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Circumcision - should this legally be allowed and what of female circumcision?<br>
<br>
In the case of males, the process typically INCREASES the sexual experience.  While I wouldn't go out of my way to do that to my male child (if I had one), I can't really complain about the fact it was done to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As far as anything that would decrease the sexual experience of a woman, I would be against such a thing.  I would hope the individual would have such a choice, not the parents.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;What of some of the more fundelmentalist Islamic sects? Should a woman be allowed to have her picture for her driver's license be taken with her head and face covered?<br>
<br>
I don't see why not if that's a common practice within the society.  I don't think however that it will go over well here in the US where that license is used for indentification purposes.<br>
 <br>
&gt;&gt;What about some of the more fundamentalist christian sects that raise girl children to be nothing more then child-bearers (granted IMO) complete with arranged marriages? <br>
<br>
Oddly enough I correspond via email with a woman in Pakistan that recently got married in an arranged marriage.  She's really quite happy with how things have worked out.  I can't say that concept works for me, but I'm not sure I'm qualified to judge it for another, or that laws should be passed to prevent it.<br>

<br>
There is much urban mythology around the fact that being uncircumcised is not hygienic (doesn’t say much for god’s ability to create if you have to whack of parts of the penis right away), but this is unfounded. The logical arguments and studies done can be found at these sites.<br>

Again, how does my not having a penis play into whether this is medically necessary or whether you suffered from being strapped to a table and cut on your penis as an infant.

Michael I am glad to hear you have not done this to your son, but like many others who are horrified by female circ’ing you seem to feel it’s not so bad for boys.

<br>
No, that's not what I said.  I wonder however what makes you qualified to decide that the such an operation 'lessens' the sexual experience for the man.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I take it you feel men can have no opinion about abortion or treating uterine cancer then? Why am I surprised that you commit yet another logical fallacy here.<br>
<br>
No, I'm simply amazed that you speak from a place of ignorance about that particular aspect of the effect of this proceedure and act as though it is fact.  Where did you get such information?<br>
<br>
M&gt;WHAT! Most advocates do so on the grounds that it's m(ore) hygenic, though that claim is debateable, but I've yet to hear a LOGICAL arguement that it decreases the experience.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;There is much urban mythology around the fact that being uncircumcised is not hygienic (doesn’t say much for god’s ability to create if you have to whack of parts of the penis right away), but this is unfounded.<br>
<br>
As I said, the notion that it increased the hygienics is certainly debateable, but that is typically the primary reason for doing this proceedure on male children.  You however implied it was a form of sexual mutilation that lead to a decrease in the overall sexual experience.  I've never seen a credible study to support that idea.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;The logical arguments and studies done can be found at these sites.<br>
<br>
Only your first link worked, and it certainly didn't suggest that the man's ability to experience his sexuality was decreased by circumcision as you claimed, but it did have this bit of information:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Beginning in 1985, studies conducted at US Army hospitals involving more than 200,000 infant boys showed a greater than ten-fold increase in urinary tract infections in uncircumcised compared with circumcised male infants; moreover, as the rate of circumcision declined throughout the years, the incidence of urinary tract infection increased.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That would suggest that there are indeed medical benefits to this procedure.<br>
<br>
Maybe you could repair the other links and demonstrate your claim that circumcision lessens the sexual experience of the man?<br>
<br>
M&gt;Ya, and I've suffered horribly as a result. Give me a break. Do you have a penis now too?<br>
<br>
&gt;Again, how does my not having a penis play into whether this is medically necessary or whether you suffered from being strapped to a table and cut on your penis as an infant.<br>
<br>
You never demonstrated the claim you made about a male's ability to experience their sexuality to it's potential because of this experience.  Can you, or can't you?  You also seem to ignore the claimed health benefits not only to the man, but to the woman as well from this proceedure.  Less overall urinary track infections for the man would naturally lead to less urinary track infections for their sexual partners.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Since you have no uncircumcised sexual experience to compare this to, and since you were unaware of the extreme danger you were put in without your consent it would be difficult for you to remember what your feelings were.<br>
<br>
It's pretty obvious however that I'm able to fully enjoy my sexuality, and you've offered me no credible evidence to support any claims to the contrary.  As for cancer rates and urinary track infections, there is evidence to suggest their are positive benefits to the procedure, even in the one link you provided that did work.  Since I could not read the others, I could not comment on anything else you implied.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Michael I am glad to hear you have not done this to your son, but like many others who are horrified by female circ’ing you seem to feel it’s not so bad for boys. <br>
<br>
Most attempts to circumcise male children have nothing to do with a motive of lessening their sexuality in any way, quite the contrary.  In addition, there are demonstrateable positive health benefits as it relates urinary track infections and cancer rates.  Female circumcision is typically done for an entirely different motive.<br>
<br>
I would still not have had my male child circumcised, but I think since the motives are quite different, and the positive health benefits have been documented, it's less obvious that this procedure does more harm than good.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Unless you feel the two procedures should be treated and seen in the same way by the law, medical community and society you are being inconsistent.<br>
<br>
The motives are typically *COMPLETELY* different between male and female circumcision.  If they were done for the same reasons, and the female would not lose sexual functionality by such an operation, I probably would feel the same way about both proceedures, but I'd probably not have tinkered with God's design either way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 255<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/16/03 9:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Sexual functionality and male circumcision.</span><hr size=1> Start here for a history of the procedure<br>

Women are prone to urinary infections does that mean we should have something taken off? Also penile cancer is extremely rare in both uncircumcised and circumcised men.

These &quot;documented benefits&quot; have been completely debunked. Turns out it was actually exclusive breastfeeding that reduced infection.

I don't want to ask anyone to take my word for medical advice since I am not a medical professional, but the reason schools and daycares ask for immuno records is because a child that is not immunized is at much greater risk to contract and then expose the others.<br>

<br>
Now not all diseases are this subtle, but if it goes unnoticed, the exposure time to other chilren is longer and kids touch, snot and sneeze on each other so much the contact is increased. Yes, my children may be immunized, but this is not a guarantee against contracting the disease and having a case of it in the schools (or children not immunized and so at such greater risk of exposing mine) puts my kid in the second group listed below.<br>

It's not as serious perhaps as denying insulin to diabetic children and some of the other alarming things done in the name of religion to the innocent, but still it puts my kids at greater risk against my beliefs to accomodate their choice to be negligent with their own. <br>

I was against circing our son, but didn't feel it was worth the fight against my DH (he is bull headed sometimes). Now I wish I had. Oh well. Live and learn. I hope DS understands as he grows older. <br>
<br>
Vacs - another worry are parents who start a series of vacs on their child and then stop. A child isn't full immune, but it could cause them to get a virus, have it mutate a little and then produces a strand that can infect vaced children. Medical reasons (family history of reactions to immunizations) I can understand, but not religious.<br>
<br>
My DS had head surgery at 9 weeks old. Cosmetic head surgery, as his deformity would not have harmed him (aside from the psycological harm of being deformed) as he grew older. This proceedure usually needs a blood transfusion, heads bleed alot. They managed to get through the surgery without using the blood I donated, but over the next 24 hours DS's blood count didn't recover as quickly as they would have liked. He probably would have been fine eventually (longer time in PICU etc) but we decided to go ahead with the blood transfusion. He went from pasty white to healthy looking with the transfusion. I can't imagine not being able to give my son something he needed because of my religion. <br>
