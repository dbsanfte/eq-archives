<br>
Without warning, faster than Rachel could react, Lord Radek had her head tilted to one side, exposing her neck to his hungry gaze.  All rational thought flew out the window as his fangs sank into her neck, and he began to drink.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rachel expected pain.  She was utterly unprepared for the pleasure that coursed through her system as the vampire Lord drank.  Despite that, however, she could feel herself weakening as he drained her blood.  As she was about to black out, his mouth left her neck, and he supported her as she began to collapse.<br>

She collapsed in Radek's arms, completely passing out.  The last thing she remembered thinking was: *It's not so bad...to die...*<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The next night...<br>
<br>
Rachel slowly opened her eyes, her mind not fully awake yet.  She looked around sleepily, noticing it was dark again and she was...in the woods?  She sat up and rubbed her eyes.  As she did so, she felt an arm that had been around her shoulder fall limply to the ground.  She glanced over at it absently.<br>
<br>
Then her eyes snapped open in sudden alarm, and she stood quickly.  She turned to face the person who had been sleeping beside her in one swift movement.  It had been Radek, who also had his other arm around his daughter, Rynn.  They were both still fast asleep, propped up against a tree.<br>
<br>
Rachel sighed, placing her hand on her chest to calm her heart.  It had been beating rapidly, almost painfully...for some strange reason, the idea to run away had completely left her mind.  She suddenly remembered what had happened the other night.<br>
<br>
She remembered a strong sense of fear and yet...tranquility.  She remembered his eyes when he had her against the tree, extremely angry and hungry.  *Was I...dying?*<br>
<br>
She touched her neck gently, expecting to feel a deep scar.  Oddly enough, there was hardly any mark at all.  She pushed her hair behind one ear and sighed again, relieved.  She walked over to another tree and sat down under it.<br>
<br>
&quot;How strange...&quot; she muttered softly, placing her fingers on her neck again.<br>
