<br>
I am in a debate with my fundamentalist brother.  I asked him if he believed God to play favorites with people, since he feels so blessed to have been raised Christian.  I made the comment, if only Christians are to be saved, why is it God picks only certain people to be raised this way and have plenty of opportunity to hear of God, whereas others, due to culture, family, what have you, are highly lacking in hearing of the Christian God and more likely to be doomed.<br>
<br>
Here is a paraphrase of his response... &quot;Of course God plays favorites. That’s why guys like Abraham, Noah, David, etc. were highly favored or found in much favor or found to be righteous by God.&quot;<br>
<br>
Interested on thoughts and arguments on this, either way.  <br>
<br>
I guess I wonder, too, if God knew everything that would happen throughout time even before He created Adam and Eve (going off the assumption this is true), why not just place His favorites right in heaven and the ones He knew would be damned right in hell?  Why even give any of us &quot;free will&quot;, or a chance on earth?<br>
<br>
Thanks for insights.<br>

This is why I feel that if there is a God, then he exists on a different plane, and isn't necessarily involved in what is going on down here.  Sort of a deist approach I guess.  One could argue that if God really dictates our actions, then people can't sin because God is the one controlling us.  It would be his sin, not our's.  People born in certain areas of the world would never learn about God, so then I suppose that someone could construe God as playing favorites.  I guess the argument for God talking to Abraham, Noah, etc could be that he just spoke to people who could handle the responsibility.  However, why would he play favorites to the extent that he would choose for certain groups to never hear about him?  If we are all his children, then we should all have equal opportunities.  When I have a second child, I'm not going to take one child into a room alone and tell them that I love them, and that I am there for them, while leaving the other child out in the cold.  I might give one child more priveleges or responsibilities than the other if that one child proved they could handle it, but that is about the extent of it.  Professing my love to them or telling them I am there for them would be distributed equally among all my children.<br>

<br>
LDS believe god did know about the fall but that there is some celestial law outside of god to which even he must answer to we all have to be born into these human bodies and live on earth here for a time before our spirit selves can return to him. It seems there are several gods on Jehovah's level too so there must be some authority above him too.<br>
<br>
P.S. Any answer you get to this will be some sort of weak apologetic. There's no doubt some of us are given a natural advantage if raised in the &quot;true&quot; religion and some of us are apparently even given a chance to convert after death (when of course we would have more physical proof of the supernatural) if not alreay touched by missionaries in this life. Religion is not fair, god is not such a loving parent and the judeo-xian system of eternal punishment is a farce but those who embrace it will defend it the same way an abused child defends his mother and can't see the harm she's causing..it's sort of sad really.<br>

God knows where we are all going, but that doesnt mean, He is making our choices for us.  If he had just put us where we will all end up.  Justice would not be served.   You cannot punish someone for a crime that has not been committed.  You can't reward someone for good they haven't done.<br>
<br>
I had a conversation with a woman who was burned severely in a car accident.  Her fingers were burned off, they took her ear lobe to make a nose. It was realy bad.  She went around giving talks on positive thinking.  I told her that there was no way I could handle something like that and stay as optimistic as she is.  She said, that we only know what we are capable of once we are faced with it.  <br>
<br>
When Abraham went up to sacrifice Isiaac, he wasnt proving anything to God, he(Abraham) was teaching something to Abraham.  This life is more about us defining and understanding our own charachters.<br>
<br>
God uses some people, like Moses, Noah and others to teach us and show us the way.  <br>
<br>
Each of us is unique in our skills strengths and weaknesses and so the life experiences we are given are to help us grow in whatever way necessary.  God allows us to make our own choices and sometimes the consequences of our choices cause us or others stress in one way or another.  The test in these situations is whether we will turn to him for help and comfort  or turn away from him and become angry and bitter.<br>
<br>
As far as someone who isnt raised in a Christian home, we have discussed in some threads below the LDS doctrine of proxy baptism and missionary work in the spirit world where we await the resurrection.  God will provide EVERY person the chance to hear the gospel and allow them to choose.<br>
<br>
In the Old Testament where God protects the House of Israel and seems to favor them over others it is because he had to be sure that Jesus would be born into the situation he was so that he could perform the Atonement on our behalf.  The people in the OT are Jesus ancestors.  That lineage and the Abrahamic covenant had to be kept in tact.<br>

<br>
&quot;As far as someone who isnt raised in a Christian home, we have discussed in some threads below the LDS doctrine of proxy baptism and missionary work in the spirit world where we await the resurrection. God will provide EVERY person the chance to hear the gospel and allow them to choose.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know this is LDS doctrine and have read it several times, but I still don't understand.  This may sound really stupid--but if you're already dead and in the spirit world, then wouldn't that kind of be a tip-off that God does exist and there really is life after death?  And if so, why would someone in that state choose to not believe what God says--I mean, what kind of idiot spirit would say no and send himself to hell?  I don't mean that to sound sarcastic, I just really don't understand this.<br>
<br>

<br>
There is a book written by a man who is not LDS, I don't know what religion he belongs to but it is the story of his out of body experience after being pronounced dead while in the army.  I think the name of the book is called Return from Tomorrow.  He describes leaving his body and &quot;travelling&quot; at the speed of thought.  One of the scenes, he observed were spirits who were &quot;hanging out&quot; around this bar, mourning the fact that they couldn't have a drink or take a drag on a cigarette.  They couldnt see beyond what they were missing about being alive.<br>
<br>
I think for some people when they die  but they don't immediately go to heaven or hell, it might just be &quot;proof&quot; to them that God doesn't exist and that we just go on in a different sphere/plain.  So it wouldn't be an automatic, oh gee there really is an afterlife, that must mean that God exists.  If you still don't see him face to face, why would a skeptic be any more inclined to have faith at that point in time?<br>

Because there might be evidence given the skeptic could not possible have had available while living. A skeptic would never have faith, which is based on air....he would have a beleif based on evidence and logic, which we are assuming god would be better at providing after death and in person than you all are in this temporal realm.<br>

<br>
These are my own thoughts on this...not doctine.  We believe that when you go to the spirit world, you retain the same knowledge/desires/appetites that you had on earth.  God and Christ are not there, but there is missionary work going on.  So, my guess would be that people will gravitate to the same type of people that they were around while they were alive.  So there's probably different religions still.  I think that an a/a would probably be one of the first to admit that perhaps there is a God after all.  But I think fundies are probably still up there spreading their hellfire speaches.  They'll just tweak their doctrine enough to make it compatible to what they're experiencing.  And I think pride will get in the way big time.  Those blinders that a lot of Christians wear will stay right where they are and they'll &quot;damn themselves&quot; because they refuse to be proven wrong....  JMO<br>
