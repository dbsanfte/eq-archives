<br>
I've posted a few times here and always enjoy the discussions and while there are a few opinions that stretch the limits I've not ever read anything that was mean or contentious.  That says a LOT for the quality of person who frequents this forum and probably the quality of person who FF's.  You all seem conservation minded and that's something I have to respect and let me say I'm of like mind when it comes to preserving our natural resources.<br>
<br>
I've got to make a decision on my first fly fishing rod/reel/line/leader/tippet, etc.  I was browsing the www.tu.org site and saw where if you become a &quot;life member&quot; for $1,000 they will give you an Orvis T-3, 8' 6&quot;, 5 wt, 4 pc rod and a large arbor Battenkill 3 reel.  When they break down the math it comes out to over $800 worth of rod/reel.   <br>
<br>
I've got to buy a rod/reel anyway, but wasn't planning on spending anything like a grand to get started in the sport.  I was thinking TFO Western Series 4pc, 9', 5 wt and a Galvan OB-4 and getting buy for less than $500 initial outlay, plus of course, line/leader/tippets and all the other stuff I'm going to need to buy.  The only reason I'd ever pay the life member dues is if I learned that Trout Unlimited was a truly worthy organization and that you all endorsed it.  You guys are my borometer when it comes to this kind of stuff and I respect your opinions.  How 'bout it?<br>
<br>
Lastly, I'd be real curious to know what kinds of waders you use.  If you could comment on boot foot vs. stocking foot I'd appreciate it.  I'm going to be a year round FF in NW AR and want the right equipment.  <br>
<br>
I'm also going to start fly tying right away.  I figure that's the other half of the sport and when I catch that first trout on a fly rod I'd love it to be on a fly of my own creation.  Can you recommend a good fly tying pattern book?  And what are some of the best patterns for the White River basin for the fall and winter seasons, especially the Bull Shoals TW and Tallycomo (sp.).  Those will be the closest TW to me, except for the Beaver TW, which I'm hearing isn't very productive.  I expect to get to know Beaver really well because it will be 10 minutes away from where we anticipate living.<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>
<br>
John Dent<br>
<br>
P.S.  We're supposed to close on our Houston house on the 1st of October and then we'll be moving up to Eureka Springs, AR in the following 2 weeks.  When's that shad kill supposed to take place on the Beaver Tail Waters?  I'll be there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyfishar>FlyFishAR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 562<br> <font color=#000000>(9/26/03 7:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.flyfishingarkansas.com/Photo%20Gallery/tn_j.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting started in the sport of FF...</span><hr size=1> John:<br>
<br>
The TU rods are a realy good deal from what I've seen. Generally you get the lifetime membership for free with the cost of the outfit. My personal first outfit was a &quot;discovery&quot; type outfit from Sage. My brother-in-law just bought a Loomis discovery set up and he loves it. Generally the first rod becomes a second outfit sooner or later. My personal favorite rods are the new Loomis Stream Dance series. But since I am Loomis endorsed you may take that however you like. I can tell you that I wouldn't endorse a product that I didn't think was the &quot;best&quot; on the market though. T&amp;T and Sage make some &quot;very&quot; good rods as well though. If you'll notice there are tons of big fish on my site that I landed with a vector rod.<br>
<br>
For reels my personal two favorites are Galvan and Ross. Galvan because it is the most well designed reel on the market. Galvan could use a better finish on their reels but they are totally bullet proof. Ross is a staple of the industry. They are well designed, well built, and have a great finish. You couldn't go wrong with either.<br>
<br>
Waders are not a difficult issue, you get what you pay for. I use Simms stuff exclusively. Anyone that truly spends time on the water should be in Simms waders. I know they are expensive but they will outlast any other brand 4 to 1. Like I said, you get what you pay for.<br>
<br>
As far as fly tying goes, I wouldn't start with a &quot;kit&quot;. Those kits, unless they are prepared by a fly shop, will usually be set up for western streams. You don't have to spend tons of money to start out with. You might just get a tool kit a vice and some dubbings. Believe me you can spend more money on fly tying than you ever thought was possible.<br>

It appears to me that the local fly fishing clubs...North Ark Fly Fishers, the AFF in Little Rock, and the fly fishing club in Rogers/Springdale also the Jonesboro group, and Midsouth Flyfishers, and there are other out of state groups helping, are doing more on the local level than TU has ever done for &quot;our&quot; fisherys.  I would rather spend my money at home, than to give to a national organization where not all of the funds will go locally.  My thousand bucks would be better spent on my stream through the efforts of my local club, than  being lost in the administrative hubbub of TU.  I am not discounting TU as a great organization, and they have done great things in other parts of the country.  But unless I am badly mistaken and I certainly will apoligize if I am, but I am not sure what TU has done here.  At Taney, it very likely is a different story.  The Branson Chapter of TU is very active and there are good things happening on the Tablerock Tailwaters.  Just my opinion John, I would join the local club, pay the dues, cast some rods of members, make a decision, get what you want, then work hard ($1000.00 worth or more) to help the local club continue its good works on your home waters.<br>

I suppose with the lifetime membership to TU you would also get a lifetime subscription to their magazine, along with that rod that is not a bad deal.  As for you trying to find a rod, cast all the rods you can get your hands on.  The rod I like may not fit your casting style(or your soon to be casting style) so I will not try to push a rod on you.....St. Croix.....Sage......Loomis well maybe just a little.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I do like the large arbor Battenkills, but what I look for in a reel is smooth drag and a SWEET sound.<br>
<br>
I have to go with stocking foot waders.  Good all around waders are breathable; nice in the warmer months, and put a couple of layers on under them in the cold months.<br>
<br>
If you are going to start fly tying I think Wooly Buggers are great.  They are a real good fly to tie for beginners and they really catch fish on the White.<br>
<br>
The first trout I caught was on a fly I tied(ugliest thing you ever saw) and looking back I wish I had kept that fly.  I'm kind of a pack rat though, but It would be cool to have.<br>
<br>
I'm sure everyone else on here will help you more than I did.  All I can really say for sure is that you are in pursuit of the most beautiful sport in the world!!!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I was talking to a fellow named Michael at the fly shop section of our Bass Pro Shop store in Katy this evening.  He's been a FF for 35 years and has forgotten more than I'll probably ever know about the sport.  (He really thinks highly of Haulaholic (Troy) too.  Says all kind of nice things about him.)  Anyway, he tended to agree with you about TU not doing much for AR waters.  Maybe the dues would be better off spent on a local project up there, but I'm not sure there are any clubs in the Eureka Springs area.  I'll find out when we get there in about 3 weeks.<br>
<br>
I felt like a kid in a candy store in that fly shop.  And I was able to finally touchie feelie all those things I've been seeing online for the last 5 months; rods, reels, vises, tools.  Michael even tied a few flies for me while I was there.  It was impressive.  Going back for a fly lesson on Sunday and will get a chance to throw a number of rods under his watchful eye.  It's fun being around someone with a lot of knowledge and experience.  FF'er are special people.<br>

TU? Save your money for Stream help that will help your area.<br>
 FFF and your local FFF chapter/ club will give you a much better return. Not all fish in Ark. are Trout. <br>
 Boots? Stocking foot. With good boots will do you better.<br>
  I like neopreme 3 mm. winter and COLD water. In the summer Breathables are nice. I have worn my Cartharts coveralls under my breatheable in Michigan's PM in November. <br>
  Rod? This is a tough one. The TFO is a very good deal and cast well. I rep for St. Croix What can I say.American made.<br>
 Reel. Here I go with the STH I-M-POP casette I can carry several lines in my vest. Cassettes are under $10.00 each.<br>
 Tying. Got to www.flyanglersonline.com and read the 'beginning fly tying'.(left side) great info. on what to buy. How to tye several flies. each a learning step.<br>
 Vice? Master Vice II, bobbin, Thread in 6/0 brown, black, red, yellow. Chenille in olive, brown and black. Grizzly hackle saddle #2, Sally Henson's &quot;Hard as Nails&quot;<br>
 Now the fun begins. Finding &quot;Tying Stuff&quot; you will look at road kill diffently from now on. Friends that duck hunt are good to have.  Hobby shops have some great craft fur. I will say that you will end up buying much at the local fly Shop. You will up grade to maybe a Renzite vice, Ceramic Bobbins. Marzette whip finsher. Have 20 spools of thread. 8 hackle necks. Boxes of dubbing, feathes, fur, and assorted Tying Stuff. You will need a large Tackle type softside box to carry it in with wheels and of course a light and cord.<br>
 If you can get to any of the Conclaves you will soon find out just what fly fishing, Tying, and casting are all about.<br>
  It is a sport that grows as you what it to. It will become a Life style. not just a hobby. Welcome to the Brotherhood of fly fishers.<br>

Then there is the lake.  I've read the Stripers average 16 lbs.  Now that would be a handful on a fly.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In all my years here, I have never fished the Beaver Tailwaters.  I got spoiled on the White, Norfork and Taneycomo.  But tell you what, when you get here, lets check it out together and see if the story is true.  Seriously I think there just has not been the efforts applied to the Beaver as there have been the rest of the White River system. Now the other day I was badmouthing TU for not doing much to preserve and conserve Arkansas rivers.  I may have to eat mush now.  I just noticed that the arkansas tu chapter which is based in Springdale is working on improvements to Beaver.  Here is the info on that<br>
