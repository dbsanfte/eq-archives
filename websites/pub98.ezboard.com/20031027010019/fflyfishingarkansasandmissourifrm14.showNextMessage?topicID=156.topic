I have found that over the years there are many locations on the river we fish that Spey casting is a &quot;must have&quot; in some of the situations. The most basic of course is the &quot;Switch Cast&quot;. The Switch Cast is nothing more really than a long distance roll cast. The thread on Prairie fishing reminded me of situations where the pond is surrounded by trees and brush. I'd need to get a fly a moderate distance out into the center of the pond where an over head cast would be impossible. The switch cast has put me on some big bass in the past.<br>
<br>
The Snake Roll is an extremely useful cast as well. Fishing from a boat where you need some distance but you have 3 guys looking for space. In lieu of trying to make a long cast with an off hand, a Snake Roll can roll of the finger tips with little effort from a sitting position.<br>
<br>
The single or double spey. Fishing the White on high water can be pretty difficult. The water rises and restricts how far out you can wade. In addition it gets you closer to the trees and grass on the banks and makes a back cast more difficult. You are up to your waist in water, trying to keep your footing, with grass behind you, and you are trying to make a cast with an indicator, split shot, and some furry fly. It's an impossible task. A simple single or double spey and you can stand and cast all day. The best part is you don't have to wade back to get your fly out of the grass. You spend much more time fishing and you are much less fatigued by the end of the day.<br>
<br>
Andrew and I have spent some time going after some big fatties that would be impossible to fish for without spey casting. I'm sure that's why those big fish are parked in those locations. Have you ever seen a big fish holding and wondered &quot;If I could only cast to that fish but I have no back cast&quot;?<br>
<br>
Over he next few months we are going to have several opportunities to learn some spey casting. Mike aka Maddog is hosting a fish-in at the end of September. We are going to have the Southern Conclave in October. Plus we are trying to talk some of the fly shops here in Arkansas into talking Simon Gawesworth into coming and giving a couple of spey classes. Those would cost some money but it would be money well spent.<br>
<br>
I don't feel like I'm giving too many secrets away here, but if you are &quot;at all&quot; serious about your fly fishing you need to learn how to spey cast. That is especially true with a single hand rod.<br>

If you make it to Maddog's &quot;Fish-in&quot; that class will be free. Also, if you make it to the conclave you can get free lessons there as well. All the others will cost up to $600 per day.<br>

Reading through your Spey Casting info....I have often wondered why it would not be pratical in the salt.  I have often talked to FF75 about this, and he feels it would be very useful from a boat while fishing the flats. It seems a day of trying to double haul a big 9 or 10 wt to bonefish and tarpon would be extremely tiring.  Why not spey cast to those big boys instead.  I also see the practicality of spey casting while fishing the surf also. Your and the boards thoughts? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=holland@flyfishingarkansasandmissouri>Holland</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#000000>(8/28/03 2:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=147.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Just Say Spey</span><hr size=1> I have used a spey type roll cast often while idling away long days on the water just as something different to do.

     I am definitely interested in learning how to Spey Cast. I met you and Andrew at the Sowbug last March when I was certified as a Casting Instructor. I will be at Conclave in October. Did I miss something on the schedule of events re: Spey Casting clinic? Do I need to sign up? Is this something you are trying to put together? Please tell me more.<br>
     I just found this web site. Man, this is great stuff! I added it to my &quot;favorites&quot;.  Most of the others I'm hooked into in Ok, Colo., N.M., and Texas aren't nearly this active or informative. I see guys logged in anytime between 5am and 11pm. Good job. Keep up the good work.<br>

     Thanks for the welcome. I really worked hard preparing to get certified. First, I ordered the video and study guide from Federation of Fly Fishers in Montana. Look on their Web site. This is key. Most of the questions and nearly all the demonstration parts of the test ( 2 part test) come from the study guide and video. You can also get a print out of the casting part of the test off the web. Then I read from cover to cover and hilighted Mel Krieger's, Joan Wolff's, and Lefty Kreh's books and then went back over the highlight's. (not absolutely necessary but it did help fill in some blanks I didn't fully understand after reading the FFF material). I also bought Mel Krieger's and Doug Swisher's advanced videos and studied them until my wife threatened to strangle me. She said she knew I had to have them memorized because she certainly did. Then I practiced and practiced and practiced some more almost every day and sometimes twice a day for about 6 months in my front yard. I would like to have 5 dollars for every car that drove by and asked &quot;are you catching anything.&quot;<br>
Then when I thought I was getting close I called Allen Crise in Texas (a well known and very competent fly casting instructor) and made an appointment for a half day lesson, to fine tune me.It was well worth the 6 hour drive one way. Al and I went through the whole demonstration part of the test step by step. He picked up a fault I had (rolling my wrist which was causing my casts to curve) which I had been having trouble with for years and was killing my accuracy that I would never have picked up  on my own. He also got my backcast up higher which he said the testers, Chuck Easterling and Art Mazzier would nail me for if I didn't correct. Jimmy, I don't know where you live but if you are thinking about testing and you're in Arkansas, I reccomend talking to Chuck (if he can help you since he's a tester ) or John Wilson. I've seen John cast and he is very good and has been certified for a long time.<br>
     Even if you don't pass the first time, the process is priceless. Good luck and let me know if I can help you.<br>

By the way Chuck is no longer a Master Casting Instructor. He's been promoted to the Federation Board of Governors. I always knew Chuck was one of the most knowledgeable casters I'd ever seen. <br>
<br>
The spey casting thread was more of a what if.... I just had a thought that it is something I find myself doing more and more. I don't remember spey casting at all several years ago though. I continue to find more opportunities where it is more productive than before. I also seem to be catching bigger fish.<br>

John,<br>
     Thanks for the welcome.Count me in on the Spey casting classes provided I can get there from S.W. Okla. I know you will be busy at Conclave this Oct., but if you can work me in, I need some help with my distance casting and any thing else you think I need to work on. I do alot of open water casting to stripers and sandbass from a boat and I could really use the extra distance. Most of the time I'm using Teeny T Series lines on a 5wt. for Sandies and an 8wt. for Stripers. I would be more than happy getting the distance I saw you and Andrew throwing last March.<br>

Just give me a yell and we'll hang out some. Chuck is the real expert. I'll be happy to tell you what I know. There will be guys there like Chuck Easterling and Bill Gammel who have forgotten more about fly casting than most people in the world will ever know. You'll have some unique opportunities to hear some different perspectives that's for sure. Congrats on your test by the way. Glad to see more certified instructors in our area. Did you see the thread on the ACA? You might give that some thought as well.<br>
