Not speaking for athiests here, just myself and likeminded skeptics, but we don't cross our arms and say 'There is no god' then scowl waiting for a victim to prove us wrong. We start from the basis of accepting nothing, then examine things logicly as they are presented and add them to our collection of rules for evaluating our world and our existance within it.  You present us with the concept of god.  We do not spring forth with this idea ourselves.  We never met the war santa or his zombie kid so we would have to, at some point, be presented this idea from someone somewhere.  Then we compare it to reality, apply logical reasoning and conclude &quot;Nope, this isn't supported by the evidence&quot; and move on.  To blindly accept it is to be a sucker, to blindly reject it is to be a cynic.  In the middle stands a skeptic.<br>
<br>
If you are like most followers of a religion, you were indoctrinated at a young age in a belief system and it has carried you thru the rest of your days.  It may not have been LDS (most likely it was) but it was most probably a cult of JC and migration among these cults is not that big a stretch for your core beliefs.  The Jesuites used to say &quot;Give us a child until he is 8 and we have him for life.&quot;  That is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>*VERY*</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> true and most of the reasons people so passionatley defend things lacking reason or cause. There are hordes of systems out there.  Atheists spring from all of them.  They arrived at their conclusions from independant examination, exploration and reason. Yet they all arrived at the same place, because there is no god. <br>

No, please review the website again. This is also known as the numbers fallacy and goes something like this &quot;so millions of people are wrong??&quot;. I was saying you are ignoring the numerous posts we both made agreeing on an issue of fact, not stating that &quot;everyone else in this forum agrees so one of us must be right&quot;. Big difference. <br>
<br>
&quot;i am definately not saying you must witness only not know or care if there is a god.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wrong again. Atheism is a default position just as my saying &quot;there is no Tooth Fairy&quot;. DBC and I have both covered this at length, but still you think that whether one &quot;cares about an issue&quot; is relevant and that if anyone makes any claim about the existence of any mythical creature the burden rests with the rest of the world to prove it or tell you they have faith. Honestly, this is beyond hopeless now. You duck questions of proving other negatives such as Santa and the big Bunny or Hubert by saying you don't care whether they exist then just keep repeating yourself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Once and for all dag--just as another LDS has already proudly said in another thread--you have faith, we do not. Belief with evidence is not faith, nor is disbelief faith and whether faith is worth having or valuable is a personal decision, but wishing atheists stood on the shaky ground of faith to make you feel better is just that.....a wish. Doesn't make it true.<br>
<br>
&quot;as soon as you make the claim &quot;there is no god&quot; you are either (A) going on faith and personal feeling or (B) you have proof to back your claim.&quot;<br>
Wrong. You cannot prove a negative and the burden of proof is on you. Period. End of story. Regardless of the degree to which you care about Hubert or I care about HF. <br>
<br>
&quot;so which is it? mine is (A)&quot;<br>
Neither. Yes, yours is A. <br>
<br>
&quot;just make sure that it can be applied to all claims.&quot;<br>
Duh--have we not repeatedly described what we seek as proof and explained scientific method, reasoning, logic and how theories are changing and disproven. We apply this equally (unlike you who pick and choose when reason applies vs. faith). Another big difference between us is that I am at least consistent when seeking the truth--I always want to use reason and evidence, even if it goes against what I want or feel.<br>
<br>
&quot;believe me i want this one dead just as much as you but you haven't showed why your claim is true or denounced it yet.&quot;<br>
Yes I have shown why my position is correct and why you are the one with the burden, and I believe you want the thread to end only if I admit atheists have faith or that I really deep down believe in a deity. When you provide me of some sort of proof of this, we might get somewhere, but until then trying to convince me with feeling will leave you exhausted from beating this horse.<br>

We believe that He restored His Church.  For a long time (and still) many people did not know we believe that.

<br>
I personally don't think it would be such a bad thing if we were referred to as &quot;restored Christians&quot; or some other distinction since as MamaG points out there are obviously many doctrines that are core to the other Christian sects (Trinity for example) that are not to  LDS.  I look at it this way, there is Catholic, Protestant, and Restored.  We all believe Jesus was the Christ, Catholics believe the Church stayed intact, protestants do not and broke away and believe there is just the Bible (but still hold many core beliefs in common, which makes sense since they broke off after those core beliefs had been established, council of Nicea for instance) and then restored that believes Christ did establish a Church, but that true authority needed to be restored.<br>
<br>
But, in a broader sense, I really think that anyone who follows Jesus  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Christ</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Christ</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->ian. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whanda>Whanda</A> at: 1/7/03 4:28:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67@religiousdebate60574>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Convicted Skeptic</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/7/03 5:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=36.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Bang!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well, I was raised with no religion and and no indoctrination at all.

Paige – I spoke in general terms and said “usually”, “typically” and “most likely”.  A person can also start smoking as an adult, but usually they start as teens, typically they do it under peer pressure and most likely will continue as adults.  Not to criticize, but just how extensive was your survey of world religion?  Who was the person that brought you into the LDS church or at the very least explained it?  Upon what relative basis did you comparatively rate it as more true and viable than any of the other surveyed theologies?  Is it just because in this one you get to become a goddess?  Is it because it is newer and got a chance to clear up some of the old errors?  Were you just bored now that school wasn't filling your time?  Lastly, upon what empirical objective evidence do you conclude that a god exists and requires your homage?<br>
<br>
Are you now raising your children the same as you, without indoctrination so that they can choose as adults?  You speak quite casually and dismiss reason without exemplifying your decisions for us.  If the reasons are sound, then you are helping us all reach salvation.  If they are arbitrary then LDS is no better than any other mythology and I can go back to drinking beer for Odin or having sex for Satan.  (Older gods have much less complex marketing campaigns, one can appreciate their directness.) <br>

<br>
i was thinking about how you said if i told you that i saw a squirrel grab a nut then you would believe me without much convincing.  this is only because you know that squirrels exist based on personal experience.  objective reality says that squirrels exist so it doesn't matter if I was born and raised in antarctica without any access to squirrels, they still exist but they do not exist for me, unless of course I choose to exercise faith.  the fact remains that the universe is huge and we live in a much smaller place than antarctica comparatively.<br>
<br>
squirrels exist in objective reality and, as the one separated from the rest of the universe, the only choices i can see is to exercise faith or live without the knowledge of squirrels.  same goes for god and the &quot;super force&quot; described in the big bang theory.<br>
<br>
the choice each individual makes will no doubt vary, from person to person and from situation to situation.  the fact that billions choose to exercise faith doesn't make them arrogant.  there's a much stronger case for arrogance in thinking that as a speck in the universe, all there is to know can be objectively explained right now in our current circumstances.  ( that's one smart speck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    )<br>
<br>
edit: i forgot to add that i don't think you personally are arrogant.  only if you claim that it's not possible for god to exist in the universe.  if i remember correctly you said it's possible like it's possible for me to remove a brain tumor by shooting myself under the chin with a shotgun.  i can accept those odds since we are such a small speck. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dag@religiousdebate60574>dag</A> at: 1/7/03 6:51:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67@religiousdebate60574>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Convicted Skeptic</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/7/03 7:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=36.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Second Thoughts About DAG = sane</span><hr size=1> Ok DAG, I will try this again, slowly.  The point about the squirriel was about the proof required being in proportion to the claim.  So if I said a fish swam, a squirrel ate a nut, or a bird flew, it would not take extrordinary evidence to support it.  It had NOTHING to do with existance.  As you put it &quot;they do not exist for me&quot; is flat out wrong.  It is contrary to everything everyone has said.  There is no such claim as selective existance.  They exist for you, in an objective reality, irrespective of you ever having seen them or not.  The squirrel was selected because it is a common note between New England and Washington, obviously if I were dealing with an Inuit or Eskimo I would have said a seal, or other animal we could share experience across.  Once again, you have taken a fragment, run it up your agaenda incompletely and eneded up to the extreme left of reality.  If you claim a fish pulled a gun on you, a bird typed a letter you dictated or a squirrel did calculus, I would require extreme proof.  Not extreme proof because you claim it 'doesn't exist for you'.  There is no choice here for you to decide it doesn't exist.  There is no faith required.  None of that applies to reality.  The universe is indeed huge, and the laws that govern it are consistant, and the matter that makes it up is homogeneous.  Carbon on earth is the same as carbon on alpha centauri.  It is CARBON.  This is very true of the big bang theory as much as any physical rule we have come to understand.  This is not true for your persoanl god.  As a skeptic and an atheist, I do not presume that god exists and challenge you to prove me wrong.  I accept only what is shown and supported as existing.  Until you pull a reason TO believe in god out of that demented bag of arguments, it remains crossed off my list of things that are real.  Furthermore, your proof is going to have to be pretty damn extensive and incontravertable.  There is a wealth of reasons why god as you claim him to be doesn't exist.

<br>
but DBC keep your pants on.  you don't need to repeat yourself slowly.  i only used a squirrel for my analogy because you did so previously and i'm pretty sure you accept the fact of their existence as much as i do (just looking for common ground here not trying to open up an old thread).  <br>
<br>
i didn't mean to claim that the squirrel did not exist only that someone being raised in a remote corner of the globe could live their life without ever knowing about squirrels (that's the point i was trying to get accross by saying it didn't exist for them).  i could visit that remote corner of the globe and try and share pictures with them and relate experiences but as long as concrete objective evidence isn't given the person can either wait to see it (in this case a squirrel) or take my word for its existence on faith alone.<br>
<br>
do you refute this?<br>
[note: questions i am not asking: am i an idiot?  did i really go to school?  how hard should i hit my head with a rock?  which of my words did i spell wrong?  why don't i believe the same as you?]<br>
<br>
sure i could take an actual squirrel but i was just trying to come up with an analogy that closely resembles believing before seeing (a.k.a. faith) with a truth that we've already both come to accept.<br>
<br>
this, unfortunately, isn't possible to do with everything in the universe.  on the speck of dust that we live on, i can't take a sample of the &quot;super force&quot; that started it all only explain the observed effects to the point where:<br>
<br>
a) others choose to accept it on faith <br>
<br>
or <br>
<br>
b) try and get someone to beat their head with a rock, read 20 books, and indoctrinate them to believe as i do<br>

There is, to my knowledge, no stuffed god somewhere in a museum, you can't go take a picture of one and show it to someone, god is not in any National Geographic movie, and there aren't any gods in zoos.  <br>
<br>
The squirrel exists, god doesn't.  Whether or not it exists for that person is irrelevant.  <br>
<br>
My children don't know what a record is, does that make them not exist? Do they have faith that the records existed? Nope- they take it as fact that at one time, we played these big black things on turn table thingies.  Why fact and not faith? They have seen pictures of records, record players in the antique malls, and have seen them used on TV (American Dreams).  Records aren't used now, but they still exist- just like the squirrel.<br>
<br>
My children also know the fact that giraffe's, panda's, kangaroos, etc exist, even though we live in the desert in the US and don't have any running around. <br>
<br>
God doesn't exist until s/he proves otherwise, or those he say he exists prove it so.<br>

Eye-witness acounts (your stories to the eskimos) are evidence.  The fact that they know of other rodents with fur and you are claiming a similar one with some minor pheynotipic variations is evidence.  The claim is not that extraordinary so hurculean evidence is not required.  It is a rodent, not a supreme War Santa of the universe beyond physical law.  Claim a blue lobster, I can accept it on testimony, evidence in proportion to claim.  Claim that lobster was 3 feet long and the requirement increases, claim it spoke french and you are leaving the realm of provable.  These universal forces you seem to imply are unreasonable are verifyable right here on earth.  You know an atom is mostly empty space, an electron whirling randomly about a proton center, lots of space.  What hold those protons together?  The strong nuclear force.  What keeps the electrons and protons of other atoms from just passing thru the empty space?  The weak nuclear force.  Why do objects get drawntogether, what foce binds them all?  Gravity.  What about this lightning stuff?  Electromagnetic.  It is all VERY reasonable and you attempt at incredulity is not reasonable to say the least.  Furthermore, implying that our universe is so large that the laws discerned here may have no application elsewhere is further diembling.

The eyewitness accounts from the Bible, BoM, and Joseph Smith History, are as accurate as me seeing a record and telling my kids about it.  These people, Moses, the 12 apostles, Mary Magdeline and other women, saw the resurrected Christ with their own eyes.  JS saw god the Father and the Resurrected Jesus Christ with his own eyes.  They recorded these accounts and I find them compelling enough to believe.  I also have felt the Holy Spirit.<br>

I liken that to tasting salt and trying to describe it to someone who has never tasted salt.  You can give every descriptive word possible, but until they taste it too, they will never understand what you are talking about.  Until a person feels the Holy Spirit, they can't comprehend it.  <br>
<br>
The fact that you havent tasted salt and you dont know what it tastes like does not equate with the non -existance of salt nor does it mean that I am &quot;off my rocker, less informed, un enlighted because I cant describe salt well enough for you to have a comprehension of what it tastes like without tasting it yourself.&quot;  In order to know what salt tastes like, you have to taste it.<br>

As for eyewitnesses, would you care to explain why the accounts on resurrection given in the bible do not agree among each other? Are the reports of eyewitnesses who were seeing Elvis accurate? What about UFOs? Alien abductions? Haunted houses? What about Raelians?<br>
<br>
There is a huge difference between beleiving without seeing in records of natural world and stories about supernatural phenomena. Records of natural world are verifiable and reproducible. You doubt that there are squarrels? You just need to go to a place where you can surely find one (zoo known to have squarrels). &quot;Supernatural&quot; phenomena are not verifiable and not reproducible and also highly subjective. When someone reports seeing things and hearing voices, how do you know that that person is perfectly sane?

Then I must only have faith that GW exists and it's not a fact that he is President, since I haven't seen him with my own eyes, but only seen pictures of him, read articles about him, and heard stories about him.<br>

I've never been to Austraila either, must only be faith that it exists.  Dh has been to Bangladesh, or so he says, he took pictures, but since I wasn't there, I guess it's just faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry, but that logic is flawed.  Things that exist to take a picture of, to see with the eyes... exist, whether or not everyone on earth has seen them.  They exist, they exist, they exist. (Ever seen a giant squid?)  <br>
<br>
Most people think roadrunners are cartoon chacters.  They are birds that really exist and run all over the roads here.  Cute little things really, not more than 2 feet high.  Fast little buggers too.  It's a fact, whether you have seen one or not.  I can provide links, pictures... If you never knew roadrunners were real, and you look at the links, pictures, etc, you are no longer taking their existance on faith, you have just expanded your knowledge, you have learned a new fact.<br>
<br>
Like I said, there is no viable form of proof that god exists.  No one, anywhere can provide that proof to anyone.  Squirrels, records, Austraila, roadrunners and giant squid exist, whether or not you have seen them.  There is no faith there.  It's fact.  <br>

Context is an erroneous answer and proves nothing except how unreliable these claims are. <br>

Eye witness accounts are the LEAST credible form of proof and indeed, if this is the only evidence a prosecutor has he will not try to get an indictment without any physical evidence. Cases without physical evidence or bad evidence (poor forensic work like a 3 point fingerpring match) have notoriously bad decisions.

This formula is flawed and about the same as saying tithing is an effective financial strategy for those in debt. If it were independently verifiable and trusted by all the faithful xian bankers in this country we'd have them investing in churches instead of loan centers and CCCS. Perhaps we should repeal the bankruptcy laws so folks can tithe instead of turn to this &quot;temporal, worldly&quot; authority for help?? No? Not reliable every time for every person?
