Wang with a boisterous, &quot;Mesa gonnas wins!&quot; grabs his bow and quiver of arrows and leaps from the table and contines, &quot;We's must goes to regishtersh!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dandalus looks up from his mug of herbal tea and says with a short laugh, &quot;Yes yes. Let me grab my cloak and i'll be down shortly, tis a bit chilly out now adays and a trip outside of the city might take a while.&quot; he tosses a silver piece to a boy near the bar sweeping the floor and says, &quot;Fetch my horse lad.&quot; as the boy scurries off Dandalus swiftly runs up the stairs taking them three at a time. In no time he is back strapping on his swordbelt, adjusting his pouches and thenthrowing on his tattered black cloak which when everybody stares at its contrast between the tattered black cloak and the fine state of his normal clothing he says indignately, &quot;Tis the Blackcloak! Stolen by hands from the Great Blackstaff himself!&quot; he says proudly. Throwing the cloak on the ends of it tattered, but still doing much to keep him warm, Dandalus gives a delighted sigh and says, &quot;Who's with us?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/brealmspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cannondothmoria>Cannon Dothmoria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF9300>(1/16/03 3:33:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Tournament</span><hr size=1> With a look of PURE astonishment, Cannon mumbles something incoherent after hearing Dandalus brag about stealing Kelben Arunson's cloak!

All about the grounds armored men on horseback, on foot and even in carriages move about. Robed men of varying ages move about as well studying the grounds and registering. A long line of men and women of all races move slowly forward as the entrants sign their names and mark which competition they will be taking place in. As Wang and Dandalus stand in line a furious looking dwarf eyes Dandalus after he bumps into him and showers a string of curses his way. Dandalus apoligizes profusely and says to Wang, &quot;What did I do?!&quot; Wang shrugs and they stand in silence listening to the stories of others on the wind. The place is loud... too loud for Wang who groans in protest. Dandalus shakes his head and hears an emphatic, &quot;Ahem!?&quot; looking forward, Dandalus sees that they are at the foot of the line finally!<br>
<br>
Dandalus says, &quot;Sorry good sirs, I am here to compete...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never mind that! Sign your name, title if you have one... all LEGIBLY... deposit your entrant fee of one gold piece into the chest here and then mark which event you will be partaking in.&quot; says an burly, but old, man dressed in finery.<br>
<br>
Dandalus says, &quot;Okay...&quot; and picks up the quill next to the open ledger and writes in... Dandalus Dovinquis... then pauses and says, &quot;Um... never mind.&quot; and then leaves the title blank. Looking at the list of competitions, Dandalus chooses Jousting, Swordplay and Mage-Duel. Smiling to himself, Dandalus says, &quot;Thank you!&quot; and moves away. <br>
<br>
Wang moves forward tosses a gold coin at the loud mouth rich old man, glares at him until he closes his mouth and puts the coin in the box for wang, then writes down... Wang Fu... Master Archer... then puts a check next to Archery for himself and after a second one on Swordplay also. Dandalus's smile falters as he sees this and Wang winks at him. Dandalus remembering his last fight with Wang years back which had nearly cost him his life swallows uncertainly and moves to follow Wang back to the horses tethered nearby... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/brealmspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lordtorrelbraton>LordTorrelBraton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF9300>(1/23/03 3:23:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tournament sign-ups</span><hr size=1> Ignoring the conversation that has been taken place as Torrel looks into his mug of ale trying to recall where his holy symbol has gone to, he shakes his head and looks to the two remaining people in the inn that are at his table. &quot;I will be heading towards the tournament grounds right now to register for the tournament Cannon. I have the slightest clue as to where my holy symbol could have gone to but i feel sorry for the person if I ever find out who stole it.&quot; Shaking his head, Torrel get's up and turns to Cannon &quot;I will see you at the tournament grounds. Try to lay off of the drink.&quot; Torrel chuckles as he heads out from the inn. Going a round the stable and saddling up his horse, he gets up onto the horse and makes his way towards the tournament grounds using the signs that point towards the tournament grounds. Once getting there and seeing the line that is there for the swordmanship, Torrel let's out a low whistle &quot;Now this is what I call a long line here.&quot; Says Torrel as he waits for his chance to sign up. Once getting towards the table for swordmanship, he writes his name &quot;Lord Torrel Braton of Waterdeep, Warrior-Cleric of Kelemvor.&quot; Then marking the spot for swordmanship and placing a gold piece in the chest. Looking around, Torrel spots Dandalus and Wang and makes his way over to them.

Cannon was concerned about you losing your holy symbol and you did look kind of heartbroken back there at the inn.&quot; flexing his fingers anxiously Dandalus says, &quot;I wonder when this tournament will begin?&quot; Seeing a commotion near the signup booth, you hear someone shout, &quot;All contestants! The individual competitions will begin at high noon. The jousting tournament preliminaries followed by the swordplay preliminaries, then the archery, then the mage-duel preliminaries.&quot; The rosters will be posted an hour prior. All contestants are ordered to be prepared prior to their matches. Anyone late to a match automatically forfeits their rounds. No excuses! That is all!&quot; and then you look about and notice that there is a few hours until noon. Dandalus says, &quot;Whew!&quot; and wipes his forehead, &quot;Guess we should get prepared then huh?

Looking him up and down you can scarce believe it is him! Dressed in black clothing underneath Plate Armor with his helm strapped to his saddle and a trio of jousting lances tied to a pack horse beside him along with a shield and a large pack?!?! You see that he has his short sword at his belt along with his pouches. A Long sword is strapped to his saddle within easy reach of his weapon hand. Nodding to you he moves He is wearing his black tattered &quot;Blackstaff&quot; cloak secured at the front with a black gemmed brooch while the cloak hangs behind him. Dandalus says, &quot;It seems i have come in time for the preliminaries, lets go check the rosters.&quot; and swings off of his horse and ties it and his pack horse together and says some words of magic with some effort and then says, &quot;A little insurance that i'll know if someone is messing with my goods.&quot; <br>
<br>
Walking over to the rosters, you can see that Wangs scoring system is based on best shots so he will not be competing against others competing in the sword and lance matches. Dandalus says as he looks at the jousting list, &quot;Lord Mortimer of Belfast and myself joust third&quot; then points out the sword list and says, &quot;Ah Torrel!

A dark-armored Duke won the first joust. The second joust was won by a silver armored man called Valiant with a Blue Dragon on his shield. You hear the announcing trumpets for the next match and then the heralds speak...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Dandalus Dovinquis!&quot; an little bit of hoots and hollering is accompanied by mild clapping and many boo's. Dandalus sitting astride his horse shakes his head and dons his helmet. Wang runs out and hands him a lance.<br>
<br>
Then the herald gestures to the other side of the grounds at a black horse mounted man in plate armor with a horned helm on. The herald says, &quot;Lord Mortimor von Schilling of Belfast. Honored Knight and Lord of house von Schilling. Slayer of the Scourge of the Belfast Dragon. Protecter of the Republic and Magistrate of the Land.&quot; this oratory is accompanied by so much hailing and cheering that you are temporarily deafened!<br>
<br>
Wang says, &quot;Ahs.... I can no's watches.&quot; and turns his back and covers his eyes.<br>

The flag is raised by the herald and then dropped. Lord Mortimer kicks his horse into motion as Dandalus does the same and they storm towards each other. Dandalus's lance faltering here and there as he attempts to steady it. At midpoint they collide and both break lances on each other. Dandalus being struck dead center in the chest and Lord Mortimer in his shoulder! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Dandalus rides slowly back to his side and says, &quot;Ahhh.... cannns.... noooott.....breeeeafff.....&quot; and coughs alot for about a minute or so then starts talking normally. &quot;How'd i do? Did i at least hit him?&quot; and then looks at his broken lance and says, &quot;Oh...&quot; and then looks at the score card and sees that they are tied. <br>
<br>
Dandalus moves back into position and says, &quot;Wang hand me another Lance. And gather the remains of the broken one so i can fix it with a spell between matches.&quot; Hefting his other lance, Dandalus fits it more securely under his arm and then rushes forward with the drop of the next flag! <br>
<br>
At mid point Dandalus and Mortimer Collide again! This time Dandalus is his in his shoulder but the lance glances off. But miraculously his lance bursts on Lord Mortimers chest sending the man flying back from the impact and then to the ground in a pile! Dandalus can scarcely believe it and then all around, people cheer at Dan's Victory! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;By the Gods?!?!&quot; Dan screams! &quot;I am invincible!&quot; and heads back to where Torrel and Wang are.<br>

The herald outside of the ring says to the onlooking crowd of people. &quot;My people, I give to you. Lord Torrel Braton of Waterdeep! Warrior-Cleric of Kelemvor!&quot; The hushed nature of the crowd seems to put you off for a second then the cheers begin slowly. A black robed man in the crowd with a mace at his belt shouts, &quot;All hail the God of the Dead! My Lord Kelemvor watches over all of us and in the end the faithless will be taken! Be warned!&quot; and then the crowd deafens out the man in black robes as your opponent comes out, &quot;My lords it is my pleasure to give you the runner up champion for last years contest, Jaster Juliens!&quot; and the crowd literally explodes with cheers! Dandalus and Wang standing at the edge of the rails look about and shrug at you. Remembering Dandalus's entrance cheers you guess you have to show them something to make them believe in you... Perhaps winning this fight will give you some respect... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/brealmspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lordtorrelbraton>LordTorrelBraton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF9300>(1/27/03 8:32:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Tournament</span><hr size=1> Torrel blinks at the sight that is before, with Dandalus winning the joust. &quot;It looks like Dandalus does have a chance!&quot; Says Torrel as he claps his hands together for Dandalus victory, as he Dandalus coming over to them &quot;Dandalus, you did that joust as if you been doing that for years.

The herald yells, &quot;Fight!&quot; and the man Jhaster quickly saltues with his longsword and then lashes out like lightning with his whip scoring a hit on your swordhand casuing pain to go up your forearm! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That move came so fast and with a flick of his wrist the whip was gone again before you could even register the pain in your hand underneath your gauntlet!
