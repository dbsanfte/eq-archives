Its Creationist, and gives this example in an arguement kids can use to shut up an evolutionist.<br>
-------<br>
&quot;Evolutionists teach that whales evolved from a land mammal. Question 1: &quot;But what do you mean by that? Do you mean that a four-footed mammal was the ancestor of the whales?&quot;<br>
<br>
Answer: &quot;Yes. We used to think something like a cow or buffalo habitually ventured into the water eating seaweed. Through many generations of mutation and natural selection, it gradually lost its legs and gained the ability to swim. We now think it was probably a carnivorous animal, something like a wolf, which descended into the whales.&quot;<br>
-------<br>
Um. I thought life began in the water and then moved up onto soiL? I can't remember anyone ever telling me life began on land. Very odd. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/5/03 10:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Evolution again...</span><hr size=1> No one said life began on land, they said one mammal made the transitoin back into the water from the land (several did actually, dolphins, seals, otters, etc.)  Take for example a polar bear.  It is an excellent aquatic animal, well suited to functioning in the icey waters of the artic.  Were it's environment to change and survival pressure to force it into spending more time in the water than on land, those adaptations that give it competative advantages in the water would be selected for naturally.  Ones with better webbed toes would swim faster, larger lung capacity or vO2 max blood saturation would be able to submerge longer and consequently survive longer.  Each step carries it further away from its original form.  Allow enough time to pass and it will approach the phenotype of a seal, continue longer and it could wind up as a whale. (Not an actual whale, but sharing many of the physical characteristics that grant competative advantages, flippers, tails, dorsal fins, etc.)<br>
<br>
One of the common misconceptions is that any point on the line is considered an end point.  You look at a kodiac today or a cave bear from 60,000 years ago, you see the predacessor and relatives of polar bears today.  You don't look at a polar bear and see an animal in transition from land to water dwelling, you see an animal that is excellently adapted to its present environment.  Neither of those relatives would survive in the polar environment.  Changes in that environment (global warming breaking up the ice of its habitat, requiring more water time, less land time, etc) result in changes to what makes the animal successful.  It either adapts or dies out when something else comes along better at competing for its resources.  Look at the skeletal structure of a whale, it has bones that match those of other mammals, including leg, hip and finger bones.  Same for seals, other cetacians, pinipeds and aquatic mammals.  The structures have changed, but the underlying design is the same. Those flippers have finger and arm bones under the skin.<br>
<br>
So my question is why WOULDN'T an animal adapting to an environment be explained evolution?  How does &quot;God did it&quot; seem more reasonable?  It seems to me that if an animal could only adapt away from an environment it would not be a very sound system or promote survival.  Naturally organisms have to be able to adapt to whatever environment they compete in. <p><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>(1) &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; <br>

<br>
1) What I mean by that is yes, whales, dolphins, seals, walruses, otters, hippos, etc. all evolved from land mammals into very effective aquatic creatures.<br>
<br>
2) We know this to be true because the fossil record supports it, we can see it happening in the current world, it is in keeping with the predictive value of current biological theory and supported by the evidence.<br>
<br>
3) The difference it makes is that by its confirmation of current theoretical predictions, it supports them.  Were it to be otherwise, we would have to revise the current theories to adequately explain the anomolies, in other words, find better answers.<br>
<br>
4) If this is wrong, we revise (as indicated above) and look for how to be right.  However, this is not the case presently, because it IS in keeping with the predictive value of current biological theory.<br>
<br>
Now the dialogue presented and tactics explained were quite insidious.  They called the provocateur to not take an actual counter position and only attempt to undermine through the respondants ignorance or arguments from disbelief sound scientific principles. This is unethical.  The disproof of a theory should rest on the merits of the theory, not a short coming of the instructors knowledge or an attempt at ridicule. Furthermore, even if the provocateur were successful in undermining confidence, they have not advanced a better solution set nor does it validate their 'god did it' position of creationism.  This is not some either/or relationship where evolution gets disproved so god can take center stage again.  Just doesn't work like that.  That is called a False Dichotomy and is a logical fallacy.<br>
<br>
Corrected dialogue from your site:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Let me illustrate the use of these questions with a hypothetical—but likely—scenario.

<br>
Answer: &quot;Yes. We used to think something like a cow or buffalo habitually ventured into the water eating seaweed. Through many generations of mutation and natural selection, it gradually lost its legs and gained the ability to swim. We now think it was probably a carnivorous animal, something like a wolf, which descended into the whales.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Correct Answer:  As above, just fine so far...<br>
<br>
(Now begins the dishonesty)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Question No. 1 continued as appropriate: &quot;Do you mean that through small point mutations, it not only modified its legs to become a strong swimmer, but it also gained extra vertebrae, an oil-covered skin just right for life in the water, a respiratory system allowing the animal to hold its breath for extended periods, an excessively large bulk with insulation to protect it from continual exposure to the cold ocean temperatures, the ability to give birth and nurse underwater–all from changes in a wolf-like animal?&quot;<br>
<br>
Answer: &quot;I guess that's what we do think.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Correct answer: No, we do not claim it ever modified itself.  Evolution teaches that of the population present, the stronger swimmers survived better and had more offspring.  The blubber laden ones survived better and had more offspring, the oily ones survived better and had more offspring, the longer spined ones survived better and had more offspring, the heritable traits over time accumulated like the steps of a walk and the journey took them far afield from their original appearances.<br>
<br>
(Lets really crank up the dishonesty now.)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Question No. 2: &quot;How do you know this to be true? Is there evidence to support this theory?&quot;<br>
<br>
Answer: &quot;Well, the textbook shows a series of sketches, but, now that you mention it, these are hypothetical forms. I remember reading an article in the newspaper which said scientists had found a long, snake-like whale fossil with legs somewhat like a sea lion; but you know, that's not really wolf-like ... I don't know. How should I know? I'm just required to teach this stuff.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Correct answer:  Yes, there is evidence (See #2 above.) <br>
<br>
This is just rank propaganda and plain old silly.  There are fossils, there are current creatures on similar transitions, there is physiological evidence, there is theoretic consistency.  This is a deception and poor science.  Any teacher that bad better not teach my kids, I will do everything I can to have him fired for inadequacy.<br>
<br>
So lets look at the websites closing and see their true colors.  It isn't about teaching or learning, it is about getting kids in the schools to undermine scientific theory that is substantiated as agents of the cult.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Mr. Jack tells me that question number two is &quot;the killer question,&quot; and that seldom does a discussion ever get to questions three and four.

<br>
There are several of each, and I'll hit the highlights.<br>
<br>
Evolution (the currently generally accepted theories):<br>
<br>
Neo-Darwinism, a/k/a Modern Synthesis: This combines Darwin's gradualistic model of Natural Selection with genetic inheritance (sp?). (There are many parts to &quot;Natural Selection&quot; that I won't get into here.)<br>
<br>
Puntuated Equilibrianism: This is a challenge to the gradualistic model portion of neoDarwinism. You can kinda-sorta think of neoDarwinism as a slope, like a long wheel-chair ramp. Puntuated Eq. is more of a viewpoint that evolution takes place in short, quick spurts, with much longer periods of stability. Think of it like a flight of stairs, with the vertical parts being the short periods of quick evolution, and the flat stairsteps as the longer period of stability with relatively little change.<br>
<br>
Darwinism, strictly speaking of the exact theory which Darwin wrote up, isn't complete, and only consists of noting how gradual changes in populations via variability in inheritance cause &quot;evolution&quot;, without any understanding of how inheritance or the variations in offspring occur. The keeper part of Darwinism is &quot;Natural Selection&quot;, which is basically an unguided method of sorting &quot;better traits&quot; (traits better suited for survival) preferentially over &quot;lesser traits&quot; (traits &quot;worser&quot; suited for survival). For example, offspring that have clear eye lens are better able to survive when searching for food through sight than offspring that have foggy lens. So it is far more probable that the foggy lens offspring will die off before having grand-offspring that the clear lens offspring. Thus, the clear lens offspring are &quot;better suited&quot; to the environment of seeing food.<br>
<br>
Creationism (these aren't theories in the scientific sense, and one should know the difference between the scientific sense of &quot;theory&quot; and the secular, dumbed-down sense)<br>
<br>
Young Earth Creationism: Viewpoint that the earth was created in 6 days not much more than 10,000 years ago, as described by the Genesis account.<br>
<br>
Old Earth Creationism: Viewpoint that the earth is old, and that Genesis 1 describes 6 long periods of time rather than 6 24-hour days. May or may not be compatible with Theistic Evolution.<br>
<br>
Theistic Evolution: The idea that evolution occurs (yes, apes and humans share a common ancestor), but that it is directed by God.<br>
<br>
Intelligent Design: God-directed creation, where the &quot;intelligence&quot; that is doing the &quot;designing&quot; is left unspecified (they tend not to admit &quot;God&quot; as being the creator in their &quot;scientific&quot; papers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), but points to all of the &quot;design&quot; found in living systems and the universe. More of an attack on naturalistic evolution than a positive explanation of how things work.<br>
<br>
I'm probably missing a few, but these are the ones that come to mind.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.<br>

These, strictly speaking, aren't &quot;theories&quot;, but hopefully you'll see the point.<br>
<br>
A first theory could be that &quot;the earth is wavy&quot;. Meaning, that it has hills, valleys, etc. We get this from every day observance.<br>
<br>
A second theory might try to expand on that, and try to say that &quot;the earth is flat&quot;. Meaning that, overall, the hills and valleys even out, and that they extend in an infinite plane north, south, east, and west. &quot;The four corners of the earth.&quot; I mean, when you look from a high mountain top, it looks like it goes on forever...<br>
<br>
A third theory might be to say that the earth is round, a/k/a &quot;a sphere&quot;.  Certain evidence supports this if you look very closely; for example, carefully observing a sailing ship on the horizon, the body of the ship disappears first, and the sails last. Also, what happens to the sun after it goes down in the west and tries to rise again in the east?<br>
<br>
A fourth theory might say that the earth isn't strictly a &quot;sphere&quot;, but it actually is flatter at the poles and fatter at the equator, and is better described as an &quot;oblate spheroid&quot;. Precise measurements and an understanding of the forces of spinning bodies would lead to this theory.<br>
<br>
A fifth theory would note that more refined measurements would show that the fatter portion near the equator is actually slightly fatter just south of the equator than it is in the north. So we have a north-south asymetric oblate spheroid.<br>
<br>
A sixth theory would note......<br>

To understand the connection requires one to look at (and understand!) the actual fossils that tie A (Mesonychid) to B (Ambulocetus).<br>
<br>
This is the point where us non-specialists apply a bit of &quot;trust&quot; to the experts. (Of course, if we don't trust them enough, we always have the ability to go learn the stuff, and make our own independent determination. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
