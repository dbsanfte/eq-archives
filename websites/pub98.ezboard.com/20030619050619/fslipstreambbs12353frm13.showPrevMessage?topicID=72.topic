&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The World According to Seamus Harper</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (Chapter 1, Paragraph 1, Verse 1)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
<br>
Beka watched Bobby’s slowly retreating backside disappear into Winnepeg Drift. She felt the onset of tears but pushed them back. She wouldn’t cry over him, not again. This was the last time he’d leave her and the last time she would ever think about him. He’d betrayed her trust and that was the worst thing you could do to a Valentine. Bobby knew that from day one and he still went ahead with his plan. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, thanks for the ride. Send me a postcard if you ever find me again,” said the less irritating voice of the young man who’d tagged along on the missile debacle from Earth. The kid stood across from Beka in the airlock. He had nothing except the clothes on his back, a gun, and his rapid-fire mouth. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You’re leaving?” Beka asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He shrugged. “Sure. Why not?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I thought I offered you a place on this ship?” Beka said, remembering what she’d said in the heat of a very tense moment. Even then she hadn’t been sure about honoring the offer, but after looking at the kid, she realized he needed all the help he could get. He was all skin and bones, hidden terribly by the thin clothes he wore. His face was smudged with dirt and she was pretty sure his hair was sticking up from the grease accumulated from never washing his hair. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I figured that offer was bogus. You just needed me to help you stop Psycho-Bobby,” he said. Beka laughed. Bobby was off the ship for no more than a few minutes and she was already laughing. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Harper…”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Hey, you got my name right!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“As I was saying: Harper, how old are you?” she asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“How old do you think I am?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Cute, but I’m asking the questions right now. How old are you?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I turned twenty two weeks ago,” he said almost shyly. He was embarrassed to be an amateur. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Okay, and in those twenty years, how many drifts have you been on?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“None.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Exactly. You don’t know a thing about being a spacer. If I let you go out there, you’ll be dead in a week. And what would Mother Harper think if I let her son die?” Beka asked, trying to be slightly playful. Harper looked down at his deteriorating shoes. The flirtatious grin vanished.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“My mom’s dead,” he said, a host of painful memories crossing his eyes all at once. Beka flinched. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Sorry.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s okay. You didn’t know.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“But regardless, I offered you a job on the Maru and I intend to honor that offer. You won’t survive out there on your own, Harper. If you stay on the Maru, we can work on making a passable spacer out of you. Besides, I’d be a fool to let a good mechanic walk away,” she said, smiling. Harper looked at her, a genuine smile appearing. She couldn’t help but notice that he was a little cute when he smiled like that. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“So you’re holding me hostage for my own good?” he asked playfully. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I’ve got a rare mudfoot specimen fully intact. Do you know how many museums would kill to have you as their main exhibit?” she said. Harper’s face fell. His eyes darted around, looking for the fastest way out. Beka realized her mistake. “I’m kidding, Harper! I’m not gonna sell you!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper recovered, putting on a sly grin. “Oh, sure, I knew that.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“I’m sure you did,” she said. She stuck out her hand. “Seamus Harper, I’d like to offer you the job of Chief Engineer of the Eureka Maru. What do you say? I promise you won’t be bored.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper stared at her hand, weighing his options carefully. It took him a second to realize he only had two options. Leave and risk being killed, robbed, or sold into slavery, or stay and work with machines for a beautiful woman willing to give him shelter and food. He gripped her hand and shook heartily. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You got yourself an engineer, Boss,” he said excitedly. Beka smiled. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Good. Now let’s go get you some new clothes…and shoes…and you’ll have to take five showers before we leave…and lose the earring…”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What? What’s wrong with my earring?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Nothing, just get rid of it.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Fine. Can I at least keep the tattoo?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You have a tattoo?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He sighed. “I can cover it up if you think a yin yang will offend people.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
She glared at him, but her eyes remained playful. “Well I do try to maintain a small amount of respectability on board.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper snorted. He punched his fist against the wall, not bothering to look when a piece of panel fell to the floor. “Yeah, I see what you mean. There’s lots of respectability to be had on board the Junk Ship Maru.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“All right, you made your point, short stuff,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Oooo, low blow,” Harper said. Beka leaned in forward. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Very low,” she laughed. Harper laughed long with her. “Okay, you can keep the tattoo.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Gee, thanks, Boss,” Harper said. Beka smiled and walked away from the airlock. Harper followed her to the flight deck, a look of confusion crossing his face. “Aren’t we gonna go get all those things you wanted?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“On Winnepeg Drift? Not likely. Out there you’ll only find murderers, thieves, pirates, and the rest of the scum of the universe,” Beka explained. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Must be the perfect place for Bobby then,” Harper muttered. Beka chose to ignore the comment, though she couldn’t help but agree with him slightly. Maybe one day she’d feel differently about her estranged lover, but right now, she was mad and she didn’t quite feel like defending Bobby’s softer qualities. “So where we goin’, Boss?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Concordia Drift,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Why there?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Do you have a preference? Because I know you’ve been all over the Known Worlds,” she said sarcastically. Harper glared at her good-naturedly, but she could see a pang of humiliation in his eyes.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No. I was just wondering why,” he said quietly, shuffling his feet on the deck plating. Beka frowned, knowing she must have overstepped a line when she’d teased him. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well, so you know, we’re going to Concordia because it’s one of the best shopping centers and because it’s the closest to San-Ska-Re,” she said. She got into the pilot’s chair. Harper moved closer, putting his hand on top of the chair.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What’s San-Ska-Re?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s a docking facility that fixes ships, sells parts, and provides…other services,” she said, winking at him. Harper nodded, understanding completely. “And I’ve got other crew members waiting for me there.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Harper gulped. “There – there are other…people on the Maru?” he asked nervously. Beka was about to release the Maru from Winnepeg’s docking clamps, but stopped when she heard his shaking voice. She turned to face him, but he wouldn’t meet her eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You didn’t think it was gonna be just you and me, did you, Harper?” she asked. He didn’t answer the question. His eyes darted around the flight deck, searching for something to concentrate on. “Hey, don’t worry. You’ll love Rev and Vex.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Huh?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“The other crew members, Reverend Behemial Far Traveler and Vexpag,” she said. “You can call them Rev and Vex for short. I left them at San-Ska-Re while Bobby and I…well, you know. To tell you the truth, they really didn’t care much for Bobby.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Must have been his sparkling personality that won them over,” Harper said. Beka chuckled. His smiled brightened. He seemed to take pleasure in making her smile or laugh. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Yeah, you’re probably right,” she agreed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Shifting nervously Harper said, “So what’re they like?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Well Rev is a Wayist monk. I’ve known him for a little over a year. He can be annoying sometimes with all of his spiritual mumbo jumbo, but it always seems to work out in the end,” she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Great. He’ll probably try to convert me,” Harper said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Rev won’t convert you. He’ll – and I quote – ‘Show you that you’re already a Wayist.’ End quote,” she said. Harper smiled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“And Vexpag?” he asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Beka paused for a minute, thinking. She stared at Harper and smiled. “I think you two will get along great.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“You sure?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
She smiled sympathetically. “You’ve gotta have some friends in this universe, Harper.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He gave a defeated sigh. “I guess I could give it a try.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Good,” she said. Strapping herself into the chair, she waited until Harper was holding on to something before pulling the Maru out of the docking station. “Good-bye Winnepeg, hello Concordia.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
