<br>
A pitcher does have a glove and he is at an unfair advantage by being so close to the hitter and with the bats they are manufacturing these days it is very dangerous to be in his position, but they also make shin guards and helmets for pitchers to wear and I wouldn't think they were any less of a man if they chose to wear that equipment. So I would have to say that in my opinion in league it is probably wrong to hit the middle but in tourneys pitchers should prepare themselves for that to happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tavaroo>Tavaroo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#8B0000>(7/1/03 3:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=378.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Middle's Open?</span><hr size=1> You know, I look at this 2 ways:<br>
<br>
1.  Not every batter can place hit.  If a pitcher consistantly pitches outside on lefty who can only hit down the 1st base line, then you know I don't feel sorry for em if it happens.  You have pitchers out there that try to be fancy with the way the spin the ball or place a ball and don't realize that some of these guys will come up the middle if you are not paying attention.  Not because they plan to, but because they just can't control the placement of their hit as well as others.<br>
<br>
2.  There are those place hitters that do like to try and decapitate the pitcher intentionally cause they either think its funny, or dislike the guy or the team they are on, or plain and simple...cause they can.  Guys like that make this game dangerous for pitchers and to be honest, the main reason most do it is because..they don't have to pitch.<br>

Alot of people do it because they dont have to pitch. They just chill in the outfield and catch lazy fly balls. I sure as heck wouldnt want to stand up against the big boys and have them tee off on me.<br>
<br>
Alot of people Dont hit the middle out of respect. Its not like most of us are going to play pro baseball or softball (those days have passed) I would hate to see any local player die playing softball, over a league game or tourney game, or just some smack talk. Some people should think about the consequences.<br>
<br>
Some guys hit the middle all the time. I assume to build their ego. Its harder to get a base hit everytime than it is to hit the middle. <br>
<br>
And there are accidents and players who just swing at the ball and where ever it goes it goes. <br>
<br>

Third, the pitcher is NEVER defenseless! Throw and set up. Pitchers know what pitches are liable to come back. <br>

But because it's the easy way to get a hit.  Pitchers know what they are getting into.  Take Tim Brown for example he pitchers for the Mariners and he has been hit by some of the hardest hitters around and he don't complain.  He always says it part of the game.  He is in his 40's and he isn't scare.  Most people don't like people hitting up the middle cause there pitcher can't field.  You know what I hat most is when your playing co-ed and they put a women out there to pitch, some teams do it on purpose so the men on the other team won't hit the middle.  To me that chicken sh1t, but i will still hit the middle if thats what it takes to win.  And I hope no one gets hurt.  <br>

<br>
E- it is considered part of the game but generally considered an open invite for the other team<br>
<br>
D- it is still considered ok but players whom have played upper levels probably refrain against it.<br>
<br>
C- considered a direct attempt to hit the pitcher. Will be retaliation by the other team most likely(usually this is where the pitcher hands the ball over to the offending player if he is smart{this class has enough pop to kill someone})<br>
<br>
B- if you do it you are probably not regarded in the best way.<br>
<br>
A and above- almost always an accident, can and will kill someone. Refrained by all players as much probably by fear of retaliation as for respect for the other team.<br>
<br>
Oh and my two cents (and I pitch) I hit to the sides of the pitcher on occassion and if you do it just be ready to pitch. And I probably have been hit at by as many as anyone in the game. And just for the record I have been hit twice in my life both times it hurt like hell!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

It is a game!!!  Most people have to go to work on Monday but upper class players love to play every weekend they can.  And to try to hurt a fellow player when players are hard to come by any way is wrong.  If the pitch is outside or in the wrong place that is one thing but to move around and try to hurt someone is Bull SH**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C0D9D9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tmeigs@oklahomasoftball>tmeigs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#8B0000>(7/7/03 10:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=378.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Hit the middle?</span><hr size=1> This has been an issue every year I have played. Until recently a bigger issue. Everyone knows the favor will be returned if done. Typically, the lower classes have this problem more to the lack of bat control. I would say the upper classes only resort to these tactics when the door is opened by the opposing team. BUT, I have seem numerous teams with many players hitting the middle on every occasion given. The pitcher is at a disadvantage, only that he is the closest and has less time to react.<br>
With the new composite bats the reaction time for an infielder is not good either. This is going to be a issue for many moons to come. I think pads and head gear is OK but this is not an invite to hit the middle. If you hit the guy, at least have the class to ask if he is all right and apologize. But if the game is played in the middle, you have no choice in the matter but take what is given you.<br>
I personally try to lift and drive the ball when pitched outside. But occasionally I'll top it, the pitcher can tell you chop at a ball and drag your hands. Enough said by an old timer.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=378.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=378.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=378.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=378.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/baseball/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=378.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.threadControl?topicID=378.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/baseball/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=378.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=378.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="oklahomasoftballfrm2">Oklahoma Softball<option value="oklahomasoftballfrm9">Buy/Sell/Trade<option value="oklahomasoftballfrm10">Find a Team/Player<option value="oklahomasoftballfrm1">Announcements<option value="oklahomasoftballfrm6">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B0000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball>Oklahoma Softball</a><font color=#8B0000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2>Oklahoma Softball</a> <font color=#8B0000> - </font><a href="OklahomaSoftball.net">OklahomaSoftball.net</a><font color=#8B0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
