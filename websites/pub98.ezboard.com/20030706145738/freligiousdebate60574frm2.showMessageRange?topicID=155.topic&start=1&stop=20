Should it make a difference if someone vandalizes your car just because it's there and he's drunk, or if he does it because you're Jewish and he doesn't like 'your kind'?  Should there be stiffer penalties for breaking a mosque's window than breaking a store window?<br>

This is one issue that I agree with our idiot president about.  I feel that any violent crime is a hate crime, and that people should be punished based off the crime itself as opposed to the motive.  My husband is a white heterosexual male who labels himself as a Presbyterian.  If he was walking down the street next to a black-Jewish homosexual, and one guy beat up my husband while another guy beat up the black-Jewish homosexual, then I would want both men to get the same punishment.  Just because my husband is in the majority, it doesn't mean he doesn't deserve the same protection as minorities.  I also don't expect special treatment for having a Jewish background.  Whether someone kills me for wearing my Star of David, or whether they kill me because they want the $20 in my wallet, it doesn't matter.  I'm just as dead either way.  Violent criminals need to be stopped regardless of their motive.  Hate crimes just need to be addressed in the sense that our society needs education about different groups, and they need to realize that everyone is human.  Hate crimes are something that can be somewhat controlled IMO because education can curb the instances of these crimes.  JMO.<br>

<br>
&quot;Intention&quot; is quite relevant in these cases.<br>
<br>
Now as far as &quot;hate crime&quot; vs &quot;regular crime&quot;, I don't think it should matter who the victim was (white hetero or gay black), but the background/research on the perp. Does the perp's living quarters and previous convictions indicate a focused hate? A general hate? Situational stupidity?<br>
<br>
And I don't think the issue of conviction should hinge on the answer, but the question of &quot;rehabilitation&quot; [sic!] would come into play. (Which is a whole 'nuther ball-o-wax.)<br>

Some people are addicted to the hard drugs and steal to support their habit. Some people steal to feed a family. Some people are cold blooded killers. etc etc etc.. The 8th amendment has been interperted by our supreme courts to also mean the punishment ought to be proportional to the crime. The legal system takes into considerations many factors before filing charges but when the motivation is &quot;hate&quot; it is scary.

There is a world of difference if a woman kills her husband in a moment of rage over his infidelity, or if she coldly calculates his murder just to cash in a huge insurance policy and run off with the cabana boy. As Rusty pointed out, the law has always recognized this by categorizing murder based on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>intent</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. By making hate crime legislation, we are recognizing that hate is a very bad sort of intent - right up there with insurance gain.<br>
<br>
There is a difference between assault and robbery to support a drug habit, and assault and robbery to punish someone for their sexual identity. I think when a person is targeted for crime based on race, sexual orientation or religion it is far more heinous than if it is based on the perpetrator's drug addiction - even if the end result is identical. If some drunk asshole starts a little bonfire in my yard, that's bad, but if the bonfire is a burning cross started by an anti-abortionist, that's far worse IMHO.<br>
<br>
Hate crime creates a base level of fear for those in the target group. We ALL probably live with some level of fear/anxiety about getting attacked by a mugger or rapist, but if you are gay/Jewish/black or whatever, then you also may have to live with fear/anxiety about being attacked for your identity alone. It's unfair that anyone should be in a greater degree of danger based on their identity, and hate crime legislation tries to ameliorate that.<br>
<br>
The problem with hate crime legislation is that motivation can be hard to prove. If a xian and a jew argue in a bar and get in a fight, where they might have previously been charged with disorderly conduct or assault, one of them may now be faced with much harsher &quot;hate crime&quot; charges even though he didn't know the other's religion. Lawyers are going to leverage this legislation like crazy and that is the real problem that I see with it.<br>

Intent is separate from motive.  Intent is whether you meant to kill them or not.  Motivation is why you did it.  I can intend to kill someone for various motives.<br>
<br>
The problem with Hate Crime Legislation is that it sucks.  It is too vague and ambiguous and worst of all applied inequitably.  Example: A racist black kills a white, they will not be sentenced under hate crime law.  A white who is NOT racist kills someone and they happen to be black, they will be sentenced.  Every time. It is too volitile a political issue not to be subrogated by it.  DA's need to appear diligent in their prosections, but they don't want to appear racist either.<br>
<br>
Federal sentencing standards are rigidly controlled to generate equitable punishments.  They have a grid and an evaluation chart for totaling a score to determine the range the criminal falls within.  Statistics are kept and a &quot;Hanging Judge&quot; will be shuffled around out of damaging roles by assignment committees.  State sentencing is far more liberal with its applications.  It is not required to be reported and judges have far greater discretion in application.  Even so, in CT at least there is a sentencing review commission and if a criminal feels they were dealt with unfairly, they can file a complaint.<br>
<br>
Crimes are covered under the law.  Hate crimes are heinous in nature.  Heinous crimes are covered.  A new categorization does not need to be created simple so some legislators can book brownie points with their constituents for re-election.<br>

<br>
How accurate are these statistics if hate crime legislation hasn't actually passed?  These people were charged with crimes in general, and they haven't stood in a court of law to be charged specifically with hate crimes.  I'm sure that many of these convictions fit in with the definition of hate crimes, but it hasn't been determined exactly how many.  Also, what was the racial background of the victim in all 2,253 cases where a black was convicted?  Followers of people such as Farakhan commit crimes against Jews because he convinced many of them that Jews are at the root of all their suffering.  How many of them committed crimes against gays?<br>
<br>
&quot;!5 out of 20 death role convictions have been against a non white . This statistic alone suggest we do not apply our laws in a fair manner.&quot;<br>
<br>
This should be irrelevant when it comes to determine if hate crime legislation should pass.  We can't all of a sudden punish white people because some non-whites got screwed.  We need to focus on fixing the system to make sure that people in poor socio-economic conditions get fair representation in a court of law.  Throwing more white people in jail doesn't change the suffering of a black man who is sitting in jail because he was wrongly accused.  The statistics will also be skewed because of those poor socio-economic conditions.  It is no secret that kids who grow up in poverty have higher rates of criminal activity and drug use.  If a high percentage of blacks and hispanics live in these impovershed conditions, then they naturally will commit a high percentage of the crimes, and therefore they will make up a high percentage of the prison population.  I'm not saying that people of a certain race are inherently prone to crime, so I hope nobody is taking what I say out of context.  I am saying that certain living conditions breed more crime, and unfortunately many minorities live in these poor conditions.  I think improving conditions can help curb the crime rate among these groups, but if they do commit the crime, then they need to do the time.  I don't want a murderer released because our statistics need to look more &quot;fair&quot;.  <br>

   Some states have a hate law and these figures probably do have a margin of error but they are FBI statistics and you can't discredit them without something  to support your claim. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 283<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/18/03 4:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: motivation</span><hr size=1> conflict of deffinitions.<br>

FBI codifies statistics of crimes categorized as Hate Crimes.  very different from the legislative Hate Crime laws.  The FBI statistics are more accurately representative because they pull from the case based on crimes motivated as hate based.  The only control would be civil vs criminal actions.<br>
<br>
A minority person (black was an arbitrary choice for illustration) will not get charged by a politically motivated prosecutor (elected official, cares about public perception, career path, etc) because interest groups will wield it as a means of control.  They will use it for the only class of citizen that is legally allowed to be selected against, white males.  You won't see the same deferrence in civil actions because private citizens don't carwe about election.<br>
<br>
I stand by the reasoning, heinous crime is covered under current law.  Hate crimes are heinous in nature.  This does not need to be re-invented.  It would only serve to imbalance or destabalize current practices. <p>DBC67<br>

 That doesn't show its a bad law but instead shows  a bad prosecutor. Hate crimes isn't  about white and black nor black and white. Since 9/11 most of the hate crimes have been against moslems. Somehow this thread has narrowed it down to black versus white. Hate crime legislature has been in effect since 1969 and outlawed violence on the basis of race, religion, and color . The new legislature would expand protection to gender, disabliltiy, and sexual orientation.  The FBI statistics in question are FROM states sending the information to the FBI and a review of the statistics will also break it down state to state. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 284<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/19/03 10:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hate Crimes?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That doesn't show its a bad law but instead shows a bad prosecutor. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> The law does not exist in a vacuum.

The law can be written to cover any circumstance, and a new circumstance will invariably arise that has not been covered. New laws that are made have to be enforceable by the police, prosecutable by the attorneys, and decidable by the judges. If you write a law that does not work in this framework, it is a crap law. The purpose of this newest hate crime legislation has nothing to do with the crimes, and everything to do with scoring political points for the elected officials. Just like Dubyah's late term abortion laws, which already had existing statues covering exactly the same scenario. This type of unnecessary, redundant legislation only makes application of the law more difficult and unwieldy.<br>

I find it ironic that a girl from texas is arguing to expand protection to gender, disability, and sexual orientation.  Not because you personally are arguing it, but because of the Texas position on that.  Gender and disability are already covered under existing laws.  Sexual orientation is not.  No bill under the current administration will pass with the orientation group in an enforceable state.  Right now Texas has a case before the supreme court for their anti-homosexual laws, and every court so far has decided that they were constitutional, despite the fact that they apply and attack only homosexuals.<br>
<br>
Please, aside from attacking what has been said, demonstrate for us why you feel the laws should be enacted.  I am interested in why you are so concerned and what benefits you see as deriving from them.<br>

I was only using crimes against blacks as an example.  There is no need for me to list every single group that is attacked.  Blacks have the highest number of hate crimes committed against them, so they were the easiest example.  As for hate crimes since 9/11, it isn't true that most of the hate crimes have been committed against Muslims.  Crimes against Muslims are on the rise, this is true, but they still pale in comparison to attacks against blacks and Jews.  That doesn't make them less tragic, I was just saying that your statement was inaccurate.  Assuming every hate crime logged is truly a hate crime, attacks against Jews are more than twice that of Muslims, and attacks against blacks are more than 6 times that of Muslims.  In 2002, there were 480 recorded attacks against Muslims, almost 1100 against Jews and almost 3,000 against blacks.  I had obtained that info some time ago on the Anti-Defamation League website.  I'm not sure what the number was for hate crimes against gays.  Like I said, I'm not trying to minimize attacks against Muslims, I was just correcting the statement.  <br>

  Because I believe all men are created  equal and when a crime is commited based on the victems personal charactoristics , it is a crime we may be able to stop with tougher laws.<br>
  Yes I live in Texas, and so did James Bryrd JR., who was chained alive to the back of a pick up truck and dragged until his body was ripped apart all because he was black. The new legislature would allow the federal goverment to step in and assist states on hate crime violations which would insure equal justice for all.  My personal interest in this matter is I had a girlfriend in New York City that was the victem of a hate crime.  She was a male to female transexual that was dragged into an ally to be raped. When it was discovered she was a transexual, she was beaten and left for dead. She passed away a few weeks later. With the current system, in your own words, a prosecutor may not be willing to prosecute. With the new laws, the federal government would step in and make sure they were prosecuted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doublelatte>Double Latte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Got Milk?</span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/19/03 8:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hate Crimes?</span><hr size=1> Texasgirl, I just want to tell you am really sorry about your friend.

I agree that the crimes mentioned here are horrendous.  But shouldn't all horrendous crimes get the same punishment?  If I recall, the men convicted of the dragging death in Jasper got the death penalty.  If they already received the death penalty, then why is there a need to change the law?  They murdered an innocent man, and now they are paying the price.  They can't get a punishment that is anymore severe than what they are already getting.  Even if they dragged a white man to his death for no apparent reason, I think the punishment should still be the same.  Murder is illegal in this country, regardless of who or why you kill.  People who kill should be punished to the fullest extent of the law, period.  I have to agree with DB when he basically says that the only reason to add hate crimes on top of the conviction is to please certain interest groups.  If the killers are being executed, then there isn't anything more you can do.  <br>
<br>
I also want to make clear that I don't have a problem keeping record of motive when it comes to these crimes.  Although they can be subject to interpretation, it is good for us to see where people are coming from when they commit crimes so we can try to stop them at the source.  It is good to acknowledge when a hate crime is committed so we can educate the public about various groups in order to prevent further attacks.  I just don't agree with making hate crimes a charge in itself.  The act of violence says enough, and it should be punished accordingly.  <br>

   Yeah in the Jasper case it recieved national attention and a harsh sentance. Statistics are funny as we can make them say pretty much what we want. California has a high number of hate crimes and the general perception is its because of the higher population. There is some truth to that, however, California has a long history of being a liberal and tolerant society.  Both factors contribute to a high number of hate crimes as prosecutors are more willing to prosecute in a liberal society. Equal rights in this country have improved alot over the last 20 or 30 years but sadly, there are still pockets in the United States where any of us would feel unsafe in. I'm a white girl and and there are areas of this country I wouldn't feel safe walking the streets.  The same can be said for any race, color, religion, and or sexual orientation. This is a free country and we have equal rights but we don't enforce it very well do we? Some areas of this country are liberal and some are conservative. That makes a difference in the enforcement of hate crimes. The new legislature makes it a federal offense and allows federal prosecutors to prosecute and will ensure a more equitable enforcement of the law.<br>
<br>
  Yes, most hate crime violations can be prosecuted under another law, however, not all of them are that effective. If someone burns a cross on the lawn of Baptist Church in the deep south, and you are unable to use Federal Hate Crime statues, it's no more than a slap on the wrist. This country needed civil rights reform and new laws in the 60's and untill Equal Rights is a reality in this Country, I am for laws that force states, cities, and counties to enforce equal rights for all of us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 290<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/20/03 2:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hate Crimes?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The new legislature makes it a federal offense and allows federal prosecutors to prosecute and will ensure a more equitable enforcement of the law.  …and untill Equal Rights is a reality in this Country, I am for laws that force states, cities, and counties to enforce equal rights for all of us. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You are never going to be happy then.  First of all, equal rights IS a reality in this country.  If you disagree than ask anyone old enough to have actually lived through the days of Rosa Parks in the deep south.  Or perhaps you could travel the world and see how it is in some of the other nations today.  Nations where you can be picked up without charge, imprisoned without trial, or killed without a word by the gov’t. Secondly, federal prosecutors are just as politically motivated as state prosecutors.  You are not escaping the flaws inherent in the system this way.  The system will never be flawless, new laws are not going to change it.  You’ll have to change the system itself.  Thirdly, you live in a federalist nation.  Once the feds step in, they are there for all eternity.  Ask anyone in California trying to grow medicinal marijuana.  It is LEGAL there to do, yet the man who ran the STATE program was arrested and convicted and is sitting right now in jail for the FEDERAL offense of growing pot.  The worst part of the Hate Crime legislation (and it is legislation, not legislature, the legislature are the people, the legislation are the laws those people produce) is the fact that it makes the MOTIVE a question of law to be decided before a trial and determine the venue for the case.  So now, before a jury is selected, the judge sits down and looks at the case and decides “Yeah, this guy is a bigot, send it to the feds.”  Motive is a question of fact, and must be put before a jury as the trier of fact to determine.  You cannot just accept that any time there is a difference of ethnicity, orientation, theology, or ANYthing that it is a hate crime.<br>
<br>
I am very sorry for the loss of your friend.  I understand now a bit more your reasons for being so convicted concerning this solution.  However, I do not see it as the solution you would want it to be.  I am sorry.<br>
