What are your thoughts?   </span><hr size=1> I for one umpired baseball for 7-8 years. It helped pay for college and supplied me with some running around money. I will not say I was the best but I know that I worked my butt out trying to be. If I knew I got one wrong or didn't intrepret the rule correctly I did everything I could to reconcile it or changed the call all together. At no point did I feel like or play god. I never looked to see who would win before the game started. I was there for the players. <br>
<br>
That is why I get so pissed when umpires are so incompetent. I am not talking about judgement calls. Most of the time I don't argue on safe or out calls, that is the way they see it. But to often they do not know the rules or are flat not paying attention. To not see a guy who is half way to the next base when the ball is pitched. Or call a ball hit 15 feet over the fence a ground rule double is ridiculous. I have even had an umpire think a SuperDuper was a legal ball. Not to mention be playing ASA and a ball never getting over dick high being called strike two. <br>
<br>
I am aware they have a tough job. I for one go way overboard arguing calls; making that job even harder. But crap this preordained winner, I am the only one who knows what the rules are, by god this is my field attitude has got to go and go now.<br>
<br>
I go to many different places where there are some great umpires. Who hustle and get within 5 feet of each call or are 35 feet into outfield when a ball is hit deep. Are up on all the latest rules. And I salute and show them the respect they deserve but feel like those 3 or 4 at every park who have no clue give the others a bad name.  <br>
<br>
Umpires do have a tough job, but they are getting paid. So in my humble opinion they should earn it. That is the bottom line. If they respect the game and are working hard they will get the respect deserve. <br>
<br>
In the end, those that really work hard hardly ever have problems or people yelling at them. And if for no other reason, if I were still umpiring I know I would work hard to do the best I could just so nobody would be bitching and moaning at me. <br>

You should have been there Friday night. An ump started to throw out Netta's Velocite because it was &quot;one of those Miken bats.&quot; After I explained it to him, he said &quot;well, I'll have to check my list when I get home.&quot; The guy had already blown a couple of calls, so that one didn't surprise me. If you have a list, you might want to know what its talking about before the game.<br>
<br>
In most cases these guys don't play. They don't pay attention to the sport, they just show up and call games for money. We need to realize that and realize that you don't get quality umps in those conditions. If the sport were more popular and generated more money, maybe that would change. Until then, I'd say understand the situation and play it. Rarely will an ump actually cost you a game, unless you make a mistake or two to put yourself in that situation.<br>
<br>

Although the umps do get paid, they are still considered to be umpires of an &quot;amateur&quot; sport.<br>
<br>
Umpires do not control the outcome of a game. Although sometimes it seems that way. They don't. Players control a win or a loss.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> punchinjudy</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#8B0000>(4/21/03 2:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   pimp</span><hr size=1> No, we were hurt by the ground rule home run. It happened in the last inning their home half. I think it would have been their or at least next to last homer. Anyway it probably didn't cost us the game but it sure hurt. They got to hit another which happened to be a guy who couldn't keep one in the yard. It was the difference in us getting beat 8 instead of being down maybe 5 and playing another inning. They might have gotten the runs anyway. But that is the whole thing we don't know what might have happen.<br>
<br>
But the interesting thing is the umpire had no clue. He heard chainlink the guy who hit it deaked and stopped at second. Saying to the umpire it was a double. So the umpire basically took his word for it. Not having seen the ball or the second chainlink fence 20 feet behind the first. Dude I was in the outfield. It was gone by plenty, not even close. <br>
<br>
This happened in the second game of the finals. To basically end the night. Maybe I am wrong but it seems to me that the team in full uni's with the huge camper in the parking lot who are supposed to win always get the close call when they play the put-togethers/scrubs in with 5 different colored shirts. No matter how well we are playing. <br>
<br>
The better team probably won but hell I would have liked to played that last inning. Especially with a couple of homers left. By no means did this ruin a great tourney but it wasn't even close. Our RF ran into the fence on the play. Even a blind man knew it was a home run. Lets just say I had a few choice words for him. And believe me if the homeplate umpire didn't know I was right he would have tossed me because I dropped about 15 f bombs for the world to hear. But that is part of it. The ump behind the plate knew he was wrong and would not change it. <br>
<br>
Anyway I am quite ashamed of the way I acted. But no competitor who wants to win could have kept their mouths shut on this one.<br>
<br>
Ask Chev17 he knows just what I am talking about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C0D9D9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=batpimp>BatPimp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 231<br> <font color=#8B0000>(4/21/03 2:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: pimp</span><hr size=1> Sounds like I would have gone Bonkers on that one too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chev17>chev17</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#8B0000>(4/21/03 3:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   was it the same umpire?</span><hr size=1> Was it the same guy that made the great call in our game?

If we were all willing to pay more money, then more players would be umpires on the side and the weakest links would be trimmed.
