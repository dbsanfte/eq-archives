	Sabine Parish, Louisiana<br>
	<br>
<br>
	"BENJAMIN JAMES!"<br>
<br>
	Eighteen year old Ben jumped with a start at the sound of his name roaring from Mr. McCarrol a fraction of a second before the chalk eraser impacted his forehead. Ben coughed in the cloud of chalk dust that instantly surrounded his head as the rest of the class laughed uproariously.<br>
<br>
	Hands on his hips, the trigonometry teacher stalked up the aisle toward Ben's desk. "Ah'm tired of telling you to put that sketch book away.  This is not an art class!" Mr. McCarrol slapped the book closed on the desk, then scooped it up. As he returned to the front of the room he said "Now class, from the looks of Mr. James here, it would appear ya'll are ready for a pop-quiz. Turn to the supplemen'al exercises on page 237 of your books and do the odd numb'ed problems, 1-11. You have 'til the end of class." The entire class groaned, more than a few of them shooting Ben dirty looks.<br>
<br>
	"Thanks a lot, James." hissed one of the other students behind him, Marty, the football team's half-back.<br>
<br>
	"Yeah Ben, thanks a lot." whispered Ted, the quarterback, across the aisle.<br>
<br>
	"Oooh, how original." Ben stage-whispered as he opened his book to the appropriate page and began working the problems. "You follow Marty's butt aroun' the field. You follow him in the classroom. You follow it in bed, to?" The class erupted in laughter.<br>
<br>
	"MR. JAMES!" roared Mr. McCarrol the second time in as many minutes.  "See me after class."<br>
<br>
	The rest of the period passed quietly as the class worked on their problems. About five minutes before the end of class, Marty leaned forward and whispered to Ben "We're going to kick your ass on your way home, freak."<br>
<br>
	"'We' who, Marty? You 'n your girlfrien' Ted?"<br>
<br>
	Mr. McCarrol drawled from the front of the room "Marty, threats on the well-bein' of one of the James twins aga'in? Why do you waste your breath? You've made the same threat 'gainst him at least once a week for the las' 4 years, as have half the rest of the football team. Him n' Jacob both. And you know darn well no one has evah laid a finger on either one of 'em and never will. 'tween there fast feet and those brothers of theirs, ya'll never catch 'em." The bell rang, dismissing the last class of the day. "Leave your papers on ya desks. Mr. James here vol'un'teered ta collect 'em." he finished as the class filed out.<br>
<br>
	Ben slowly gathered up all the papers and brought them to the front of the room. The sketch book lay open on the desk in front of the teacher. "You know, one'a these days, Marty 'n Ted are gonna catch up with you 'n your brother. That, or they ain't gon' wait 'till school's out and just jump ya right here. Provoking 'em ain't real smart." Pointing at a picture of massed soldiers marching in formation, a banner with a swastika prominently displayed at the head of the column, Mr. McCarrol asked "Wha's this, Ben?" <br>
<br>
	"Uhm. German troops." Ben said unnecessarily. "Ah saw 'em ina news reel on Sat'day." Mr. McCarrol raised an eyebrow. The James's were hardly the poorest family in town, but they didn't likely spend their meager savings on movies often. "Ah took Amanda to see 'Love on the Run.'" he explained to the trig teacher's unasked question. The teacher nodded. The James's were as frugal as any in these hard times but Ben, as practical as any of the James clan, wouldn't spare any expense when it came to his sweetheart.<br>
<br>
	"If those two ain't married inside of a year, Ah'll be surprised." he<br>
thought to himself. "She could do a lot worse in this town." Aloud, he said "And of all the things you saw in that reel," he asked, having taken his wife to the same show, "you couldn' come up with someth'n betta'n this to draw?"<br>
<br>
	"Hitler's doing great things for Germany." Ben defended himself.<br>
<br>
	"Ben, siddown for a min." Mr. McCarrol got up and came around his desk to sit on the front edge. "You know Ah fought in the Great War, right?" Ben nodded. "Germany arming up ag'in is not a good thing. This Hitler, he's a mad man. You may think he's doing great things for Germany, but rarely are 'great things for Germany' good for the rest ah the world. It's an old cliche, but it's true, war IS hell. This country, this world, does not need another war. That's where Ah fear we're headed if Germany continues on this path." He reached behind himself and picked up the sketch book. "Enough about my phil-os-phy. Ah'm a math teacher, not a history teacher." He tossed the sketch<br>
book back to Ben, adding "You can have this back on the condition that there'll be no more drawin' durin' my stirrin' lectures on Pythagoras' theorems."<br>
<br>
	"Yessuh." Ben replied. With two weeks left in his senior year, it was unlikely his favorite teacher would be expounding on Pythagoras again.<br>
<br>
	"Now get outta he'e. And watch out fo Marty and Ted." he added<br>
unnecessarily.<br>
<br>
	Jacob was waiting in the empty hall outside the trig classroom. "Which 'n did you insult this time, Marty ah Ted?" Ben's twin asked him.<br>
<br>
	"Both." Ben replied with a grin. "Twenty points. Got your runnin'<br>
shoes?"<br>
<br>
	Jake grinned back. "You betcha. Out the back field, or through town?"<br>
<br>
	"Let's give 'em a sportin' chance and go through the field. You know they can' keep up on level groun'." Jake laughed as they headed for their lockers. No one on had a prayer of keeping up with the hottest relay runners Sabine Parish had seen in years, regardless of the terrain. The rougher ground of the cross country route only meant Marty and Ted might be able to see their dust cloud. The boys stuffed their books in their lockers and headed out the back door. They took their time stretching, giving Marty and his sidekick time<br>
to figure out they were going out the back way, then started out at a light jog.<br>
<br>
	They were half way home, with no sign of Marty or Ted when the two of them jumped out of the bushes by the side of the trail suddenly and took off after them. "Tryin' to catch us already winded while they're fresh." Ben thought.<br>
<br>
	"They're gettin' smarter, but not smart enough!" both twins shared the same thought as they poured on the speed. The twins managed to stay just out of reach the rest of the way home. Just as they were coming in sight of the family farm, it looked like the footballers would catch them.<br>
<br>
	Ted reached out to grab Ben's collar. Marty made a perfect flying tackle at Jake's waist. Coach would have been proud. If he had connected. At the same moment as Marty lept, a huge shape burst out of the bushes just as they had done, slamming Marty to the ground. Hearing the commotion, Ted turned his head, his fingers grabbing only air as Ben got away. Another form burst out of the bushes on the other side of the trail, Ted becoming an instant replay of what had happened just a second ago to Marty.<br>
<br>
	Ben and Jake stopped and turned around, chests heaving. A young man in a Navy seaman's uniform held Marty on the ground. The twins younger sister Jessica had already gotten off of Ted, standing out of reach, grinning like an idiot. The sailer stuck his knee in the middle of Marty's back as he got up.  "Marty. What uh surprise. STILL tryin' to catch my brothers? Two years Ah been gone, yet it feels like yest'day Ah was rubbin' yah face in the gravel." Looking at Ted he added "Glad to see Jessie's taken up the family tradition."<br>
<br>
	"Lettin' yah kid sister protect you know, you sissies?" Ted said,<br>
getting up slowly, a menacing look at Jessica.<br>
<br>
	Jake crouched in front of Ted. "We're not the ones who got tackled bya GIRL. Wait'll THAT gets 'round school..."<br>
	<br>
	"'Sides, Jessie's been kickin' our asses for two years." Ben said.<br>
<br>
	"Grow up with 4 older brothers', ya learn to fight real good." Jessica sniggered.<br>
<br>
	"Get the hell out ah here 'fore Ah repeat our last engagement." the<br>
sailer said, picking Marty up by the collar and shoving him down the road. The entire James clan turned and headed for the gate.<br>
<br>
	"Home on leave again, Freddie?" Jake asked.<br>
<br>
	"Yup. Made it home jus' in time to set up that ambush. Marty may be the brains ah that duo, but he still ain't very bright, plannin' in front ah Jessie here."<br>
<br>
	"Tha's our Jessie." Ben said, throwing an arm around her neck,<br>
grinding his knuckles into the top of her head.<br>
<br>
	"She'll make us all proud, you wait 'n see." Jake said with a smile.<br>
<br>
	"Speakin' uh proud," Jessie added, blushing "Ah almos' forgot. These came for you t'day." She pulled two thick envelopes out of the waistband of her jeans, one each to Ben and Jake. Ben turned his over, seeing the seal of Stanford University on the front. They tore them open and started reading the contents.<br>
<br>
	"You know we can' afford to send you to college, much less Stanford, even if yah do get in." Freddie said, looking at the envelope he took from Jake.<br>
<br>
	"Ah got in! An' Ah got a scholarship!"<br>
<br>
	"What, that track scholarship?" Jake asked, looking up from his own letter briefly. "Ah got in, to! We both got the scholarship!"<br>
<br>
	"Ah course you did. They wouldn' break up the James, James relay team." the youngest brother said, walking up behind them. "You'll be the firs' James's to go to college." Louis added with a smile.<br>
<br>
	"Don' worry, you and Jessie'll go to college, to." Jake said.<br>
<br>
	"Papa will never send me to college." Jessie said. "He'll never send a girl."<br>
<br>
	"We'll make sure he does." Ben said. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hart@scbnforum58570>Hart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#FF9300>(6/19/03 3:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=111.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Family time...</span><hr size=1> OOC<br>
