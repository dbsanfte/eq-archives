China attempts to claim its jurisdiction over Taiwan using four principles of international law: first, every sovereign country has the right to protect its unity and territorial integrity; second, Taiwan historically belongs to China; third, the proclamation issued at the Cairo conferences in 1943 states that Taiwan be returned to China; lastly, Taiwan is considered a part of China in the international world. The above may sound reasonable at first glance; however, we will demonstrate that these so-called &quot;principles&quot; cannot hold under an intensive scrutiny of international law. Taiwan, logistically or juristically, is a sovereign state that should attain an international status equivalent to that of its equals. It should also be stressed that Taiwan's future can only be decided by the Taiwanese, not any superpowers or alien regimes. <br>
<br>
First of all, China's claim regarding the territorial integrity of a sovereign country is based on a principle of traditional international law. Modern international law pronounces the idea that, people have a right, which is above the territorial right of a state, to found a government that can truly represent all the people in the said region and not to be subject to oppression as a result of racial, religious, ethnic and other differences. The principle of self-determination has been asserted time and again in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial countries and peoples (1960), in the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and co-operation among States in accordance with the chart of the United Nations (1970), and in various opinions of the International Court of Justice. Therefore, when a certain number of people, or the minority groups within an existing state are oppressed, they have the right to demand independence and self-determination. Tha t is, a state's territorial right cannot override the principle of self-determination. Tibet under the Chinese regime best illustrates this point. It is widely recognized and supported that Tibetans are entitled to the right of self-determination which overweighs China's right of territorial integrity. In the case of Taiwan, it is more so since Taiwan has never been ruled by the People's Republic of China. In other words, Taiwan's effort to become an independent country conforms fully to the principle of self-determination widely adopted in international law. <br>
<br>
Secondly, China's assertion that Taiwan historically has been part of China cannot definitively determine whom the jurisdiction of Taiwan should belong to. While such a rule may have been applied to the resolution of territorial disputed in the past, it was mainly used to settle disputes among two or more states such as those between China and India, and China and southeast Asian countries, etc. Therefore, it is inappropriate to apply this principle to our case. Moreover, this rule was adopted during the feudal era when a lord treated his people on his land as his own possession at his disposal. In modern societies, the will of the people on the land in dispute has become decisive in the judicature of the International Court of Justice. Therefore, Taiwan should not be all the disposal of any alien power; the will of the people should decide the future of the land, not vice versa. The claim of territorial supremacy laid by China, while neglecting the will of the Taiwanese, not only violates international law but also reveals its territorial ambition. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, China invokes the Cairo Declaration of 1943 and Portsdam Declaration of 1945 as proof that Japan returned Taiwan to China after the war. However, it is questionable whether the proclamation made at the Cairo conferences is legally equivalent to an international treaty. Above all, since Japan was not among the attendants of these conferences, it was not legally bound by the proclamation made during these conferences. That is, the Cairo Declaration had no virtual constraining power with regard to Japan and its occupied territories. Since international law recognized only mutual peace treaties signed by the warring states, the San Francisco Peace Treaty (1951) is much more appropriate in determining the status of Taiwan. <br>
<br>
The SF Peace Treaty stated that Japan gave up its claims on Taiwan and the Pescadores. However, there were no remarks saying that Taiwan would be given to China (According to Article 21, what China would gain was stipulated in Articles 10 and 14). After signing this treaty, Japan no longer has any right to give Taiwan away because according to international law it did not own Taiwan anymore. <br>
<br>
Fourthly, to justify its intent to annex Taiwan, China suggests that one hundred and fifty-seven countries recognize that Taiwan is part of China. In fact, these countries use words such as &quot;understand&quot; or &quot;notice&quot; instead of &quot;endorse&quot; of &quot;confer&quot; referring to the &quot;One China&quot; policy. Above all, countries not directly involved in a territorial dispute have no right to decide on the ownership according to international law. For example, it means little if Japan recognizes Hawaii as a part of Canada. <br>
<br>
All in all, international law is constructed on facts and actuality. If in fact, countries recognize Taiwan as part of China, they would and should have to acquire China's permission when they trade with Taiwan and when their people, aircraft, ships travel in and out of Taiwan; otherwise, these actions would clearly violate China's sovereignty. The fact that they do not have to deal with Taiwan vis-a-vis China again demonstrates their recognition that Taiwan is not part of China. <br>
<br>
Lastly, by asking the international world to recognize Taiwan as a part of China, the Chinese government indeed exposes its insecurity toward this false claim. Why would a country request that others recognize its sovereignty over a piece of land if it really governs and owns this land? Obviously, China knows that its claim of Taiwan is factually and logistically weak. <br>

<br>
Capital and talent will go west until Taiwan opens up <br>
 <br>
<br>
GEORGE KOO<br>
 <br>
 <br>
For the first time, thousands of Taiwanese living in mainland China will fly from Shanghai - very indirectly - to Taipei to celebrate the Chinese New Year at home. Instead of a short, one-hour hop from Shanghai to Taipei, the planes will fly two long legs of a triangle, roughly quadrupling the flight time, just to be politically acceptable to Taipei. <br>
Specially chartered planes will take off from inside China and touch down in Hong Kong or Macau before proceeding to Taipei. Why? Because there is no formal recognition between governments across the Taiwan Strait, Taipei reasons that the planes cannot behave as if they were bona fide commercial flights. <br>
<br>
Taiwan's business community has been clamouring for direct links to the mainland. About $600 million (HK$135 million) is spent annually on unnecessary airfare, to say nothing of time wasted in transit. <br>
<br>
Since he came to power in 2000, many of President Chen Shui-bian's backers have urged him to move boldly towards full independence from Beijing. The end result is like the charter flights - a compromise that pleases no one and solves nothing. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, it has become increasingly obvious that the benefits of cross-strait relations are all going in one direction: to China. Taiwan's capital, people, production equipment, ideas and products are going to China. By some estimates, as much as $100 billion - more than one-fifth of the total foreign investment in China - originates in Taiwan. <br>
<br>
What about investment in the other direction, from China to Taiwan? There is none, because in contrast to Beijing's open door, Taipei's policies restrict visitors from the mainland, rendering such investments impractical. <br>
<br>
Advocates of Taiwanese independence, particularly those residing comfortably in the United States, like to point out that one cannot live by bread alone, but must have the personal freedom of choice. Sadly, Taiwan's economy has been rolling steadily downhill, and unemployment is at a record high. <br>
<br>
Some of the best and brightest are choosing with their feet. They now live and work in China, most conspicuously in and around Shanghai. <br>
<br>
They are putting down roots in China, bringing their families and buying homes. <br>
<br>
One Taipei study estimates that those leaving for the mainland represent 25 per cent of Taiwan's economic elite. Their absence ripples throughout Taiwan's economy. Taiwan's housing market is depressed because more people are selling than buying. <br>
<br>
Even Taiwan's Lions Club feels the economic shift. In the first six months of last year, its membership dropped from 35,000 to 31,000. At its peak, club membership included more than 40,000 professionals. Now, someone else is missing at every meeting, having left for the mainland. <br>
<br>
Two out of three Taiwan tourists go to the mainland for vacation. Only one out of 10,000 tourists from the mainland is able to visit Taiwan. In just 10 months last year, 12 million tourists went globe-trotting from China. <br>
<br>
The Taipei government would see immediate economic benefits merely by welcoming an annual projected stream of 300,000 visitors from across the strait. <br>
<br>
Mr Chen dares not open Taiwan to the mainland for fear of losing his political support and out of paranoia. During the debate about direct flights from the mainland, someone in his administration actually opposed them on the grounds that an unfriendly plane could make a September 11-like beeline for the presidential palace in Taipei. <br>
<br>
Chen's approval rating is at its lowest point, as is Taiwan's economy. <br>
<br>
Everyone is watching to see whether or not he will take decisive action this year to turn things around. If not, his re-election next year is not assured. He came to power with less than 40 per cent of the vote. He may have to do considerably better next time, and not count on a divided opposition, to retain power. <br>

Next time resesrch information to support your facts then just jumping in. The only reason China has surpassed India is because how harshly corruption is dealt with. My father, a pure Indian Punjabi, living in India for 45 years, loves China, he sees how an authoritarian government has raised the living standards of a large amount of people. Look at the shiny, technological skyscrapers of Shanghai and then go look at the slum city of Mumbai, our nation's business capitol. History has shown that before democracy can take place that iron fist governments can work. I see China following the model of Singapore (the highest living standards in the world). India is torn by such insignificant problems such as religious strife, nearly 1,000 people died in the Gujrat riots a year ago. And there is so much corruption in India that it is not funny, do u know how much aid meant for the Gujrat earthquake was sold for a rich @#%$ politician's benefit? Have any of u ever lived in India? If all the money that went to corruption went to help the economy, India and China would actually be equals now. Let me tell u some Indian propaganda, Why haven't we crushed Pakistan for interfering with Kashmir for the last 50 years? So we can turn the people's minds away from the internal problems of the so called Indian &quot;democracy&quot;. Some of the most sacred rivers of India are so polluted that a mere touch can spread a handful of diseases. Yet our dumbass politicians plan to connect all the rivers, hey idiot, polluted river + clean river= both rivers polluted. The reason i bash India is because hiding the truth won't help anybody. China should be followed economically, only then will India become a superpower (every patriot's dream.) I also have ulterior motives, another reason i see India and China equally. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bindiachinaboard.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chinjap>Chinjap</A> at: 2/25/03 9:03:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bindiachinaboard.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brutegorilla>BruteGorilla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/26/03 7:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/findiachinaboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.gifs.net/animate/anigorilla.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Well I agree China will become supepower too, but on the other accounts China is as bad as India.

First of all India's FOREX has gone from 26 billion in 1998 to 87 billion today. This is a tremendous growth and any sane human would know that. Not only that but our cellphone market is 20 million today, and was less then a million at 1998. Last year we had 2 million pc's sold and that numbered our entire pc market. Our pc market is growing 3 million this year. Then there is our poverty rate, it is ~20% which is bad but it has increased significantly. It is quite clear that India is not as great as China however it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. <br>
<br>
Then there is the living standards of India. First of all you slow demented maniac, do you know that there is more then 20 million Bangladeshis in our nation and they are Muslim too (yes Sunni Muslim)??? Not only that but we have Pakis (Sunnis too), Iranians, Arabs, Afghanis, Sri Lankans, etc within our naiton as well. If you thought India was poor then why would so many go to India? Go on an Arab site especially the Yemenis ones and see how many emigrated to India for higher education. <br>
<br>
Then you speak of China surrounding India, with Sri Lanka and Nepal which is a sick joke as these nations are NOT anti-Indian. Go to any Nepalese and Sri Lanka site and they will laugh at your stupid remark. The Bangladeshis might try such stunts as they are pathetic and would ruin their nation just to get India. I know it is quite sad that we were the ones that saved their @$$, we should have let more then 3 million of them get slaughtered. India in the other hand can get her revenge. Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, ASEAN, etc all want to have stronger ties with India. Most of them are vary of China and we can join hands with them to contain China especially with Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and South Korea. Believe me, it's all true.
