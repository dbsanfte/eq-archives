Bruce wrote the following:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What books properly make up the canon for the church? In answering this question, it is imperative that we not confuse the nature of the canon with the recognition of certain writings as canonical. The legitimate authority of canonical books exists independently of their being personally acknowledged as authoritative by any individual or group. The nature (or grounds) of canonicity is thus logically distinct from the history (or recognition) of canonicity.<br>
<br>
It is the inspiration of a book that renders it authoritative, not human acceptance or recognition of the book. If God has spoken, what He says is divine in itself, regardless of human response to it. It does not &quot;become divine&quot; through human agreement with it.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the canon is not the product of the Christian church. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The church has no authority to control, create, or define the Word of God. Rather, the canon controls, creates and defines the church of Christ : </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;...having been begotten again, not by corruptible seed, but by incorruptible, by the word of God which lives and abides forever.... And this is the word of good news which was preached unto you&quot; (I Peter 1:23 -25).<br>
<br>
When we understand this, we can see how erroneous it is to suppose that the corporate church, at some council of its leaders, voted on certain documents and constituted them the canon. The church cannot subsequently attribute authority to certain writings. It can simply receive them as God's revealed word which, as such, always has been the church's canon. Authority is inherent in those writings from the outset, and the church simply confesses this to be the case.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
This quote was brought to my attention in another forum on the question of Church Authority.  It has relevance here considering the topics brought up in the Eucharist thread.<br>
<br>
While I want to applaud this quote, I can't help but feel the author short-changes the Body of Christ, who certainly has a role in the recording of scripture.  What are your thoughts? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heartjoys>heartjoys</A> at: 7/21/03 7:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wordwolf>WordWolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#B87333>(7/21/03 7:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Canon/Role of the Body of Christ</span><hr size=1> I think it shortchanges FF Bruce's understanding of the canon<br>
and related topics.<br>
<br>
I've a copy of &quot;The Scrolls and the Parchments&quot;, a <br>
compilation of several of FF Bruce's works on the canon.<br>
I'd recommend this book, having read it.<br>
<br>
Bruce has offered the most sensible explanations for the<br>
formation of the 'canon' that I've seen to date.<br>
(Of course, for people who are big on hierarchy dictating<br>
 everything, his ideas will not sound so good.)<br>
<br>
Simply put, his argument is that the canon is NOT the result<br>
of a handful of men sitting around and negotiating the <br>
inclusion of various books. (That would be a formality, in his<br>
opinion.)  Bruce said the Body of Christ as a whole had no<br>
difficulty distinguishing what was canonical or not, and knew<br>
the difference.  Official proclamations simply added the <br>
official stamp to what was common knowledge. <br>
<br>
(Go ahead, attack me for believing that as well.)<br>
==============================================<br>
Bruce also had some interesting insights on how some books<br>
could easily be considered a blessing while not be seen as<br>
canonical.  (I'll let the official outcry chime in before I <br>
consider posting on that.) <br>

At first reading it sounds good, but there is a flaw.  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The church has no authority to control, create, or define the Word of God. Rather, the canon controls, creates and defines the church of Christ :<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Except that the Church defined what the canon is as opposed to heretics such as Marcion.  St Paul says the Church is the pillar and Bulwark of truth.  Only the Church as the Body of Christ could give birth to the New Testament and to define its parameters.  What the Word of God is; is the Apostolic Witness which the Church guards as her heritage, and it is Spirit not letter.  As Professor Romanides points out, it only has its power inside the communion of Saints.  No where in the New Testament is there a claim that a certain writing is the Word of God, except maybe Revelation, and interestingly enough that was the last book to make it into the canon!  Not the first as it should have been if FF Bruce's ideas were correct.  <br>
For me as Orthodox the authority of Scripture is authority because of the Church, outside of the Holy Tradition which gave birth to the New Testament, there is a collection of writings, but they come to life inside the Church.<br>

It does not &quot;become divine&quot; through human agreement with it&quot;), but misapplies that logic to reach his conclusion about the canon. In other words, his premise I think is sound, but it does not logically follow that 'God's canon' is necessarily the canon approved by the Church.<br>
<br>
Bruce is correct when he says &quot;If God has spoken, what He says is divine in itself, regardless of human response to it. It does not &quot;become divine&quot; through human agreement with it.&quot; But the flip side is also true: If God didn't speak it, it is not divine in itself, regardless of human response to it. So how do we know the canon as recognized by the church didn't miss any inspired writings? How do we know it didn't include some uninspired writings by mistake? Bruce's conclusion breaks down - for an inspired writing would be God's word even if it wasn't recognized by the church, and an uninspired writing is not the word of God even if mistakenly accepted by the church. WordWolf said &quot;Official proclamations simply added the official stamp to what was common knowledge.&quot; This may be true (although there *was* some debate about certain NT books), but since when is &quot;common knowledge&quot; a guarantee being right? So we're still back to square one, and we have no real &quot;authority&quot; that the Church's canon is the canon God intended - unless we accept that the Church *did* have authority to establish what should really be in the canon.<br>

F.F.

<br>
Granted, I haven't read any of his books, so am just gaining a small glimpse here of his thoughts, but I wonder why he says &quot;corporate church&quot; here instead of the Body of Christ, as if you can separate the two.<br>
<br>
I think A. James Bernstein made a good point about this:<br>
<br>
&quot;In early times there was no organic separation between Bible and Church, as we so often find today.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Body without the Word is without message, but the Word without the Body is without foundation.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  As Paul writes, the Body is &quot;the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth&quot; (1 Tim. 3:15)  The Church is the Living Body of the Incarnate Lord.  The Apostle does not say that the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>New Testament</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is the pillar and ground of the truth.  The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Church</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is the pillar and foundation of the truth because the New Testament was built upon her life in God.  &quot;<br>

This hits a very personal note for me, as I have been one to think (for a long, long time) that the church was not necessary in my Christian life, as long as I was reading His Word, being steadfast in prayer and abiding in truth- but, I also see the pitfalls in becoming a church unto yourself!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=24.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=24.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.threadControl?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="sparrowshearthfrm11">Hear Ye!
