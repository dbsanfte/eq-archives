The 501st Legion of Imperial Stormtroopers (aka the Legion aka 501st) is a Star Wars fan club celebrating the movies using costumes and props, in particular those of the stormtrooper characters and their various incarnations. The Legion is a not-for-profit club formed for the express purpose of bringing together costume enthusiasts and giving them a collective identity within which to operate. The Legion's aims are to celebrate the Star Wars movies through the wearing of costumes, to promote the quality and improvement of costumes and props, and most importantly to contribute to the local community through charity and volunteer work. We the members of the 501st hold no rights to these characters and recognize it is a privilege to wear these costumes. We also acknowledge that while in costume we represent these movies and as such accept the responsibility to behave professionally and civilly while in public.<br>

<br>
Article II - Membership<br>
The 501st Legion is an inclusive, equal-opportunity fan club and will not tolerate discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, or religion. The only requirement for membership is &quot;ownership&quot; of a costume celebrating the Imperial characters from the Star Wars films or its expanded universe.<br>
<br>
Upon admission, members are assigned a unique four-digit identification number following in the tradition of the stormtrooper character, TK421, mentioned in A New Hope. Preceding this number is a two-character prefix code denoting the costume of the member. The prefix codes and what costumes they identify are listed below. Members owning more than one costume still have only one identification number but are referred to using whatever prefix codes are applicable. Identification numbers will be maintained by the Legion Membership Officer and are permanently assigned. If members convert to inactive status, their numbers will be retired until such time as the member returns to active status. <br>
<br>
Persons under the age of 18 are not allowed as listed members of the 501st Legion club. The 501st claims no responsibility for minors at events that are hosted or attended by its members.<br>
<br>
<br>
The prefix codes for costumes are as follows:<br>

Article III - Organization<br>
The 501st Legion is a worldwide club but it recognizes that most activities will be on the local level. For this reason, the Legion is divided into subdivisions to foster local identity and to encourage teamwork and fraternity. The current list of Garrisons, Squads, Outposts, and Detachments, as well as information on the boundaries between these units, is maintained by the Captain of the Guard.<br>
<br>
Garrisons<br>
The largest subdivisions of the Legion are the Garrisons, which ideally cover large distinctive regions that host unique geography, language, borders or other distinguishing characteristics. A Garrison requires at least twenty five (25) members and is headed by a Garrison Commander (CO), who is elected every February by the members of the Garrison. The formation of a new Garrison may take place when an Outpost reaches sufficient membership or when a region within an existing Garrison finds pressing needs to break off and form a new Garrison.<br>
<br>
Applicants must complete a Garrison Application Form in which they list their new Garrison name, roster of members from the 501st main membership roster, territorial boundaries, Garrison logo, working website and email forum, and a brief statement of purpose outlining the reasons for their Garrison to be formed. The form will also list the administrative staff of the Garrison, including a CO, XO, PR Officer, Webmaster, and Membership Liaison who will work with the main Legion Membership Officer in helping to make sure their Garrison members are properly listed and updated on the main 501st website.<br>
<br>
The application form must be submitted to the Legion Commander and Captain of the Guard. Upon their approval, the form is then submitted to the Legion Council and voted on by the Legion Garrison Commanders in a majority vote. If approved by the Legion Council, the applicant group undergoes a one year trial period, during which it must demonstrate that it can operate as an independent body. After the one year period the Council will vote again to approve the Garrison officially. It is highly recommended when a new Garrison forms within an existing Garrison that approval first be sought from the existing Garrison Commander. Garrison Commanders are free to assemble whatever rules and administrative staff they need in their area.<br>
<br>
A Garrison CO has the following responsibilities:<br>
- organize all 501st Legion events taking place within the geographical territory of his/her Garrison proper, or delegate garrison members to organize/coordinate specific events.<br>
- represent his/her Garrison members in the Legion Council where club policy is discussed and voted on<br>
- organize his/her Garrison by appointing an administrative staff to handle the Garrison website, logo creation, public relations, communication, and enforcement of club and Garrison rules<br>
- resolve disputes internal to the Garrison and make all potential problems known to Legion Command<br>
- keep in touch with all members of his/her Garrison, either personally or through an intermediary, and build good relations and good morale among the troops<br>
- help in deciding if new Squads or Garrisons should be allowed to form within his/her Garrison territory<br>
- perform his/her duties in a professional and level-headed manner befitting an officer<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Squads<br>
Garrisons can sub-divide into Squads for even smaller areas or areas where clusters of members tend to operate together regularly. A Squad requires at least ten (10) members and is headed by a Squad Leader (SLDR), who is elected every February by the members of the Squad. Applicants must complete a Squad Application Form in which they list their new Squad name, roster of members from their local Garrison membership roster, territorial boundaries, Squad logo, working website and email forum, and a brief statement of purpose outlining the reasons for their Squad to be formed. The formation of a Squad must first be approved by the Legion Commander, Captain of the Guard, and the Garrison Commander of the area in which it is formed. If approved, the applicant group undergoes a six month trial period, during which it must demonstrate that it can operate as an independent body. After the trial period the Legion Commander, Captain of the Guard, and Garrison Commander vote again to approve the squad officially.<br>
<br>
<br>
Outposts<br>
For areas that lie outside 501st Legion control and do not have enough members to form a Garrison, an Outpost may be formed. An Outpost requires only one member and is headed by an Outpost Leader (OL), who is elected every February by the members of the Outpost. Applicants must complete an Outpost Application Form in which they list their new Outpost name, roster of members from the main 501st roster, territorial boundaries, Outpost logo, working website and email forum, and a brief statement of purpose outlining the reasons for their Outpost to be formed. Application for an Outpost must be approved by the Legion Commander and the Captain of the Guard, at which time the Outpost immediately becomes official. Once an Outpost contains twenty five members it may apply to be a recognized Garrison as outlined above and may waive the one-year trial period at the discretion of the Legion Council.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Detachments<br>
Given the diversity of costumes in the club, special 'theme' units may be created expressly to celebrate a<br>
specific aspect of the Star Wars universe. An example would be a squadron of TIE Fighter Pilots. These units are called Detachments and lie outside the organizational, rank, and voting hierarchy of the club. A Detachment requires five (5) members and is headed by a Detachment Leader (DL), who is elected by the members of the Detachment. Application for a Detachment must be approved by the Legion Commander and the Captain of the Guard. Members of Detachments still report to their respective Squads and Garrisons. 501st members may be members of multiple Detachments.<br>

Article IV - Offices<br>
Two forms of offices exist within the Legion: command and administrative. Command offices exist to oversee the organization and deployment of troops and include Garrison Commanders, Squad Leaders, Outpost Leaders, and Detachment Leaders. Administrative offices exist to perform the administrative duties required by the club and are appointed by the Legion Commander within an Administrative Staff. The administrative offices are listed below.<br>
<br>
Administrative Staff<br>
<br>
Captain of the Guard - The Captain of the Guard assists the Legion Commander by serving as arbiter in matters of contention within the club, policing the code of conduct, keeping track of the Garrison and Squad boundaries, and updating the master garrison map. <br>
<br>
Membership Officer - The Membership Officer is responsible for receiving and processing applications for membership, tracking identification numbers of members to guarantee their uniqueness, and conducting a semi-annual census to assess the current number of active members.<br>
<br>
Webmaster - The Webmaster will be in charge of the club's web site, maintaining its content and appearance and incorporating information from the other administrative officers.<br>
<br>
Merchandise Accountant - The Merchandise Accountant will monitor all merchandising and fund-raising done for the 501st Legion for the sole purpose of record-keeping. The Merchandise Accountant will be responsible for making sure copyrights are not flagrantly violated or that funds are not misused. The Merchandise Accountant may be responsible for recording all transactions and making these records available to the public. While we are not an officially sanctioned extension of Lucas Film Limited, we strive to operate within tolerable limits of their control of copyright. For this reason it is the hope of this club to keep merchandise bearing the 501st name or emblems to a minimum that serves to identify the club and no more.<br>
<br>
Public Relations Officer - This position will be responsible for accepting all news of events and activities from the club members and chronicling them. This will include field reports and pictures and will distilling this information into a form that the Webmaster can use to update a gallery on the 501st main web site. The PR Officer is also in charge of making contacts with Star Wars celebrities, convention organizers, web and print publications, and other fan clubs for the purpose of promoting the club and coordinating cooperative relationships.<br>
<br>
Executive Council<br>
Policy and administrative decisions for the 501st are handled by an Executive Council, made up of two representatives from each Garrison and the Legion's Administrative Staff. The Council is moderated by the club President, the Legion Commander.<br>
<br>
Titles commonly used and recognized within the 501st Legion<br>
LC Legion Commander<br>
LX Legion Executive Officer<br>
CO Garrison Commander<br>
XO Garrison Executive Officer<br>
SLDR Squad Leader<br>
OL Outpost Leader<br>
AO Administrative Officers - appointed by LC to service the administrative needs of the club. <br>
AO's may also serve as unit leaders elsewhere in the Legion.<br>
Enlisted - standard rank for all stormtroopers unless appointed otherwise as above <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Article V - Elections<br>
The Legion Commander, Garrison Commanders, and Squad Leaders must be voted into office. Elections for these positions are held once a year. Nominations for command offices may be made by any member within that office's region during the month of January. If no nominations are made for a particular office by midnight January 31, the officers holding these positions will maintain their posts. Voting begins on February 1. Votes are cast via email or online poll or whatever mechanism the Captain of the Guard deems appropriate. The voting will be open for exactly two weeks (fourteen days) after which no more votes will be accepted. Every member in &quot;active status&quot; or in &quot;good standing&quot; of the 501st Legion may vote. Members that are placed on &quot;inactive status&quot; may not vote until their status has been changed back to &quot;active&quot; by their Garrison CO and the Legion Membership Officer. Notice of upcoming elections will be posted on the main mailing list one week prior to the election. Notification of any elections to individual members is ultimately the job of Garrison Commanders for members in their region.<br>
<br>
The Legion Commander is elected by popular vote of the entire legion. The vote is only valid if at least 33% of the active membership actually votes. The offices of Garrison Commander, Squad Leader, Outpost Leader, and Detachment Leader are all voted on by members of each respective unit according to rules that unit has adopted. Administrative Officers are appointed by the Legion Commander, with the exception of the Merchandise Accountant, who is also elected by popular vote of the Legion. This is to avoid any conflict-of-interest between a Legion Commander and his/her choice of appointments in this office.<br>
<br>
Issues of contention concerning the club may be voted upon by the Executive Council. A call to vote will require any three Council officers to request the vote. Following this, the Council members will have one week to cast their votes via email to the club's central mailing list or to an online poll overseen by the club's Captain of the Guard. Each member of the Council holds one vote. Calls to vote can be on any topic, including the topic of removing or replacing office-holders. In this instance, however, the cause must be great enough to call for a vote. Thus, a call to replace or remove any officer must be made by at least 33% of the current membership, rounded up. This Legion Charter may be amended at any time by a popular vote.<br>

<br>
Article VI - Code of Conduct<br>
The 501st Legion recognizes that its costumes represent characters from the Star Wars films and as such, costume-wearers carry the responsibility of portraying these characters professionally and tastefully while in public. For these reasons, all members are prohibited from using foul language or behaving lewdly or obscenely while in costume and in public. <br>
<br>
The 501st Legion is dedicated to creating an environment of friendship and good will. To this end, the Legion will not tolerate the practice of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment by its members. <br>
<br>
Members who engage in such conduct will be subject to disciplinary action, including termination from the 501st Legion. This policy applies to all 501st Legion members. It applies not only to unwelcome conduct that violates state and federal laws concerning sexual harassment but also to inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature.<br>

<br>
Article VII - Costuming Standards<br>
The 501st Legion celebrates creating, owning, and wearing the costumes of the Imperial Forces as featured in the Star Wars films. To capture the magic of these characters, our goal will always be the accurate presentation and portrayal of these costumes. However, we recognize that the purpose of this hobby is for fun and creativity. Therefore, the 501st makes allowances for the creative modification of these costumes within the confines of decency (defined as being without profane or vulgar features or statements and must be viewable by young children). By the same token, different events will call for different standards. For this reason, two categories are created to help 501st members communicate what standards will be in place depending on the event being hosted or attended by club members.<br>
<br>
FORMAL/CANON - Costumes must be authentic, canon Imperial costumes from the movies or licensed media (games, books, etc.). Costumes must be devoid of stickers, ornamentation, or any other decoration not found on the original costumes. Costumes must be complete, containing all the parts in good working order and appearance. If a member has a question whether his or her costume meets the specifications of a formal costume, they may refer to information provided by the 501st Chief Armorer. Formal events include any event involving Lucasfilm and its affiliates or any other event where formal presentation is expressly asked for or required. An example of this would be escorting celebrities associated with Star Wars - this is considered an official event and calls for the group to represent the club in formal dress, unless the event organizer has specified that non-formal costumes are acceptable.<br>
<br>
INFORMAL/NON-CANON - Costumes may be authentic, canon costumes or non-authentic, non-canon costumes never seen in any Star Wars movie or book and may be decorated and ornamented as the owner desires, within the confines of decency. Decency here is defined as being without profane or vulgar features or statements and must be viewable by young children. Costumes can be painted alternate color schemes, adorned with stickers or cosmetic changes, or supplemented with articles not found in the movies. Informal events include public parties or conventions or wherever the 501st is not officially representing the club.<br>
<br>
NOTE: The default for any public appearance of the 501st is INFORMAL, although the club's code of conduct still applies. Events must be designated FORMAL for the requirements to apply. The final decision is left to the Legion Commander, event organizer, or the senior officer present.<br>

<br>
Article VIII - Merchandising and Promotional Standards<br>
<br>
It is recognized that any organization requires promotion on some level to help it grow. It is also recognized that the 501st Legion is a club based on a copyrighted property and has no legal rights to profit from the sales of merchandise bearing images or ideas from the Star Wars property. Consequently, it is agreed that whatever merchandise or promotional materials are created to advertise the 501st Legion will be sold only to members within the Legion and at cost. No material will be sold to the general public for a profit. All promotional materials will meet the following guidelines before being approved by the club. All materials not abiding by these guidelines will be considered unauthorized and forbidden to all members of the 501st Legion. Any member producing and/or distributing unauthorized Legion material will be eligible for disciplinary action by the Legion CO and or XO and could face expulsion, as decided by the Legion Council. Members wearing unauthorized Legion materials at official events shall be directed to remove these items, and if members fail to comply, said members will be eligible for disciplinary action by the Legion CO and or XO and could face expulsion.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
501st Promotional Items Set of Standards<br>
This set of standards includes any item, print, or paraphernalia that bears the 501st Legion name or logo.<br>
---------------------<br>
1 - Any items bearing the words ‘501st Legion’, ‘Fighting 501st’, or ‘Vader’s Fist’ or the 501st Logo are considered representative of the 501st Legion club. Such proposed items are to be submitted to the Legion Commander and administrative staff before being produced. The Legion CO, Legion XO, and administrative staff have final word on approval.<br>
<br>
2 - 501st items must be free of vulgarity<br>
<br>
3 - 501st items must be as free of copyrighted material as possible<br>
<br>
4 - 501st items must be sold only to club members and at cost<br>
<br>
5 - 501st items must not be advertised openly on ebay or other forums to the general public<br>
<br>
6 - 501st items must not be tied to any outside commercial entity or venture<br>
<br>

No shirt will bear the label 'Security' or 'Staff' unless created with the full permission of an event organizer and labeled specifically for that event only.<br>
<br>
8 - 501st items specifying a sub-unit of the club are allowed and encouraged. Such examples would be items promoting 501st Garrisons, Squads, and Detachments.<br>

Article IX - Disciplinary Action<br>
<br>
A member breaking the Legion code of conduct or behaving in an unacceptable manner or violating the tenets of this charter may face disciplinary action. This begins at the Garrison level. Any member in good standing may bring a charge against another member from their Garrison. The charge is brought to the attention of their Garrison Commander, who must then call a hearing. During the hearing both sides of the conflict are related and witnesses and evidence submitted and recorded. This process must run for at least one week after the hearing is called, after which time the Garrison Commander has the right to close the proceedings at any time at his or her discretion. Once the hearing is closed the Garrison Commander renders judgement and outlines the requirements for both parties to follow. The Garrison Commander has the option to assemble a panel of Garrison personnel to vote on a course of action or to decide for him- or herself.<br>
<br>
If the losing party feels wronged, he or she may then appeal to the Legion Council. A hearing is called and both parties invited to speak and submit evidence to the Council. This process must run for at least one week after the hearing is called, after which time the Legion Commander has the right to close the proceedings at any time at his or her discretion. The Legion Council then decides if the charge is a minor offense, a major offense, or one without resolution. A majority vote rules and a course of action is laid down. A minor offense brings formal censure, to which the charged member must respond with a public apology and restitution of goods or services if these are involved as well. Failing this, the member is placed on one-month probation, during which time he or she is not allowed to participate in club activities. If after probation the accused refuses to comply with the Council's directive then the Council votes on the expulsion of the member by majority vote. In cases of a major offense, the Council may move directly to a vote for expulsion. An expelled member may have his or her ID number removed and released for use by another member.<br>
<br>
Any unit of the Legion, from Outpost to the Legion itself, may redress problems in leadership by calling for a vote of no confidence. A call for no confidence requires only one person at the Outpost and Squad level to make it. It requires three people at the Garrison level. And it requires five people at the Legion level to make the call. If a call for vote is made, the Legion Captain of the Guard is called in to oversee the process. A poll is opened for one week and a vote taken of the members of that unit. If at least one-third of the unit membership votes in favor of removing the unit leader, then a one-week period begins where nominations are taken. At the end of the week, a poll is opened for one week to vote on the nominees to replace the leader. In the case of a tie, the vote opens for another week and is repeated. In the case of no nominees, Legion Command will appoint a new leader.<br>
