Glad you like the idea, sweetie. : ) We'll have to confad and think about what tricks they can play on each other. &lt;g&gt; Yeppers---talk to you later---and before I go---I loved the ending of WTMW---and I tell you, that last line begs for a sequel or at least an epilogue---with Lex having to ask Gabe for Chloe's hand in marriage---down the line. Nice, Kris---really nice. Still friends and yet they know the secret. : ) I would love for them to find out Clark's secret on the show and still remain friends. It sucks that Lex will eventually go bad. :: sob :: Your friend, Peggy. <br>

&quot;Thanks,&quot; he said.  His smile fell a little when his gaze dropped to the large shiny stones on Chloe's wedding finger.  He looked over at Lex.  &quot;So, how are you going to get Mr. Sullivan to agree to letting you marry Chloe?&quot;<br>

You are an evil evil person with Chloe second guessing her love for him.  He's Lex freaking Luthor for god's sake!!!<br>

But hey, it's your story...blah blah blah, I'm just the lowly person who reads it and enjoys.  I love the story and don't care how long you make it go on.  Of course I ended up with a 40 chapter fic once that had mainly no plot so I'd understand if you felt the need to wrap it up soon.  I still love this fic and as soon as it's done I am sooooo sending it to a special someone.  I told him about it and he thought it was a good idea.  But don't rush to finish it on his account by all<br>

OMG---Kris, this was wonderful. Chloe is going to be fine and these two will still be attached at the hip, so to speak, for a while longer. Now, if we can get Chloe to admit she really does love Lex---that it's just not the heat of passion and practice some more safe sex in the head. : ) Gives new meaning to the phrase safe sex, btw---no condoms needed. &lt;g&gt; Thanks for a wonderful chapter, sweetie. : ) Talk to you later.

Hi dear friend... how are you????<br>
Sorry for the long time for the fb but my life is being such a crazy thing these days...<br>
 <br>
Welcome to My World<br>
I loved the end... Chloe and Lex together everywhere (I wish it was true in SV), Clark a good boy (man he was creepy when in the 'bad Clark' world), Clark sharing his secret...<br>
When Chloe and Lex returned from 'bad clark' world Lex was not hurt anymore and their things were all there. I'm a little curious to know how this happened... Could you give me a 'light'????<br>
 <br>
The Completely Mental Misadventures of Mr. Mxyzptlk<br>
Oh man... This fic is getting better and better each chapter. It's so crazy and so interesting... Please please please update it soon...<br>
I'm soooooo curious to know what will happen to Chloe and Lex after this crazy thing stops (the 'dreams') and to see if Lex is going to find out about this mysteryous Mr. 'something'... LOL<br>
 <br>
Accidents Happen<br>
Oh Man... Love is soooooooo great!!!!<br>
LOL<br>
Sometimes I really envy Chloe and this 'Lex's thoughts in her head' thing...<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
You're doing such a great job... I wish you could never end it!!!!!!<br>
 <br>
Consequences<br>
I loved this fic... Lionel was a big deception for me because I was thinking of him like a smart and great friend...<br>
But well, it's Lionel, right???<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Jack was so sweet... One of the sweetest new characters I've seen in fics.<br>
 <br>
Sibling Rivalry<br>
OMG... Lucas is dead??? He's really annoying me trying to take Chloe from Lex but I'm shocked.<br>
Lionel is going to punish Lex??? Poor Lex, he'll know what hell looks like...<br>
I loved Chloe and Lex's night... Man, he could convence a cat that it's a dog<br>
ROFLMAO<br>
 <br>
Five Questions<br>
He likes her??? Oh... sweet sweet sweet<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I loved the 'stupid Lana' thought... LOL... I think that in my head too...<br>
And the best, of course, was the test drive and the 'test mouth'<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
 <br>
Tell<br>
First of all I have a question: this 'tell' would be something you do with your body that shows that you're lying??? I understood that from the fic but I had never listened the _expression before...<br>
Anyway, the fic is great... Their usual banting (I love when that happen with them) and Lex really letting her drive the porshe??? Wow<br>
*jealous grin*<br>
 <br>
The Deal<br>
I laughed so much with the 'homing beacon/car alarm' comment... Man, I almost choked and spat all the chocolate cake that was inside my mouth in the keyboard. It happened once with spaghetti... What I mess...<br>
Well, back to the fb... The fic is greeeeeat... I kinda of like, actually I really like seing Chloe with another man and making Lex 'wake up' and conquest her, you know?? (am I weird???).<br>
I never read a fic without some Chlex and I usually like Chloe/another guy. I prefer other than Clark because he's too dumb for her... But Bruce is the best other pairing (I like Lucas too) to Chloe after Lex.<br>
I know you just want to post it in your board and maybe in Cat's... But I really want to post in my site, if you let me do it, sure.<br>
If you prefer not to allow me, no problems... I understand and I'll keep reading the fic anyway because it's interesting.<br>

I can't wait to know why Rachel is the queen instead of Lillian...<br>
You talked about Julian... this is something I never understood... did or did not Lex had a brother who died when a child named Julian??? And the Lena thing?? Doesn't Lex from Superman have a sister called Lena???<br>

Great chapter!!  Loved it immensely.  Stupid n-s.net, not letting people on.   I'm so curious now!  What's the deal with the pregnancy?  I need to know!!   As for the question of one last smut scene or not . . . well, as you were so kind as to nudge me in that direction, I'll just return the favor. ^_~  <br>

How could I ever have doubted your ability to give me a smile whenever I wake up? *sigh*<br>
<br>
So I'm not one of the disappointed Kris fans since this was my fave to begin with... hehe<br>
<br>
Now I think I would love to listen to how the doctor sees this <br>
weirdness. Is it Toby? And what happened to make this pregnancy so weird? Lex and CHloe are both as far as we know it, completely human. So it could only have been<br>
Chance. Did his powers include that? It couldn't have been Clark's x-ray vision.<br>

RE: Accidents Happen, I think this was the first one of your fics I stumbled across, way back on the first or second chapter, and it has since been one of my favourites.  The last few chapters have been particularly good, and I'm anxiously awaiting the next chapter (and can't wait to see who thought &quot;I love you&quot;.)  Kudos, by the by, for keeping track of all the &quot;'s and ''s.  I know it would have had me twisted in knots about 10 chapters ago <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
RE: Consequences, I absolutely loved the ending to this story.  I thought it was really fitting.  I would have hated to see Chloe run back to her dad, Lana, Clark and Pete, and I especially liked Lex's statement to Clark at the end; it fit the tone of the fic perfectly.  I'm sorry to see this one finish, but I'm hoping this means more time for other WIPs, especially AH.<br>
<br>
I just realized, belatedly, that I haven't actually reviewed these stories yet.  I'm so sorry, that was blatant oversight on my part, because I have been loving them both.  Sorry!<br>

Accidents Happen:<br>
 <br>
First off, it's working again. &lt;g&gt; Now to the story:<br>
 <br>
I love the last line being thought---and not knowing if it's her, him or maybe both of them thinking it---it had me sighing. And the interaction between Gabe and Lex---so nice to have the father's approval. : ) God, I really love this story. <br>
 <br>
As to Consequences---I know I came in late with this piece but I love what you did with it. : ) Chloe and the other's will have some bridges to mend but with Lex's help, they'll do it. : ) <br>
 <br>
You are the most incredible writer, sweetie. I mean, how you do 4 stories at once and never get mixed up is great but the way you portray these characters, warts and all, is truly amazing. They are not perfect but then, nothing is in this world---be it the real world or the reel world. Thanks for being my friend, my sounding board, my collaborator, a great writer and sharing your talent on TBT. Talk to you later. Your friend, Peggy. <br>

As to your latest---OMG---talk about a steamy kiss. And Lex finding the ring again and giving it to Chloe. And them knowing Clark's secret and Chloe feeling a tad uncomfortable around him. I tell you, I looked different at the character the next eppy after Red, when he was bad Clark. So, I know how that character felt in that instance. Heehee---and Pete feeling a tad uncomfortable about the kissing duo. : ) This was all so wonderful. And Lex doesn't seem to be that upset about Clark's secret. He probably understands the reason why he didn't tell anybody---especially him---because of his father. Wonderful chapter sweetie.

I think this is one of my favourite stories, Kris. It has to be one of your shortest and least smutty, but I loved it. I'm currently downloading 'Prodigal' so this fic will probably be even better when I have seen more of the character of Lucas, but this is just a wonderful story anyway.

Awww---but I know the answer to that, Kris. If you'll let me give my selection for your most romantic, because it inspired my most romantic---it's got to be----the challenge piece you just posted.

I was with Clark at the end of part 27  - 'What happened?!' And I'm still kind of wondering exactly what happened even now I've read part 28. So Chloe and Lex think Clark is a meteor freak? Interesting. Looking forward to the next part, hope you post it soon.<br>

~~&gt; Glad you're enjoying it Ultra.  Like I told Deidre, it will be explained in the next chapter or two.

Heehee---safety in numbers, eh? &lt;g&gt; I love this part, Kris. : ) Clark worried that Lex might take advantage, Lex jealous, Chloe stuck in the middle---probably wondering to herself, if she could without Lex reading her mind, geeez---I'm out of here. You two bozos aren't worth my while---although, one of you is pretty hot. &lt;g&gt; You know, I'm surprised she hasn't answered Lex out loud, while talking to clark by now. Pretty confusing talking--listening---or thinking to two people at once. Can't wait to see what you come up with next. : ) Ooooo, Clark, word of advice---Chloe's a woman who can take care of herself. Nobody is taking advantage of this woman---she'd drop kick him to the ends of the earth, if they tried too. &lt;bg&gt; So watch your step, bub or you might lose two friends. Prolific Peggy. <br>

I'm enjoying all three worlds in this story very much. I'm guessing some sort of spell is making Chloe feel the pain of King Alex in that world, but will Whitney and Lex and Chloe all live too see another chapter? Looking forward to finding out. I feel kind of bad for Jerome in the other world, but if Chloe and Lex together, it's worth letting that version of Clark suffer a bit, heaven knows I'm making Clark suffer in both of my fics at the moment! But certain sacrifices must be made for the sake of the wonderful Chlex. Great couple of chapters, Kris, and I'm looking forward to more.<br>

Ohhh Chlexy goodness? Lots? Well I'm not complaining. Although poor Luke. I still sympathize with him in this ficm despite all my love for the Chlex.<br>

Well, I for one, would be interested in seeing how you handle this upcoming eppy since it seems Lucas is going for Lana (of course he is---Clark is the main character of the series---and let's face it---Lana is the one he's interested in). I have to tell you, I started to read Chapter 11 and watching Lucas' reaction to Lex and Chloe kissing---well, I can't believe I'm saying this but I dislike this character more than I dislike bad Clark in your other story. And it takes a lot to really dislike a character---you have that gift down pat of creating these extreme emotions, good or bad, in the readers minds and it's a good one, sweetie.  Sorry, won't be reading anymore because it might affect how I'm trying to write Lucas in the eppy coming up. : (<br>

Well, the title just got very relevant. It should be kind of <br>
flattering for Chloe to have the two brothers practically fighting over her, but I'm sure that's not the way she wants it to be. I almost feel sorry for Luke, but if his suffering brings Chlex, then, so be it. Can't wait for the next chapter.<br>

Awwww, I'm so sorry you don't feel well, Kris. Just go to bed and drink plenty of liquids---try cola or diet cola---any brand.

Oh, and take out those tapes of Smallville---the Smallville gang will get you through this. : ) As we all will. <br>
 <br>
I was searching for some Chlex last night on Naughty and read this, sweetie. I love it when you bring the gentleman out of Lex---and considering he was the one who caused this---or partically the reason for it---he's owning up to the consequences too---this being a bad conclusion to what happened but still---the very good conclusion----they made love. : ) I just tell you, if those guys over at Smallville could read these sections----they'd change their tune pretty fast.

Oh yeah, Bruce Wayne is friends with Batman, just like Clark Kent is friends with Superman! Thank God Lex isn't dead, you really had me worried there for a while.

Doesn't Lucas learn----you don't call Chloe chick---or any woman for that matter---even when out of range of hearing. &lt;g&gt; He's not going to get anywhere with the ladies, if he keeps doing that. &lt;g&gt; Love the way you have Lucas challenge Lex and Lex using his networking system by going to the source to find out information about Chloe---her father. : ) It's not what you know but who you know----advantage: Lex. Can't wait to see the last part, sweetie. Ahhhhh----it's going to be a grand Valentines day tomorrow, I tell you. : ) Prolific Peggy, who loves the sweet, sentimental, PG-13 side of Kris. PS: With the added humor to this piece, it's spectacular, hon. : ) And I gotta say it---I actually like this Lucas---he's like that pesky little brother that Lex wanted---not like the cutthroat in the series. : ) Hmmmmm----maybe I should do a piece with him.

Utterly delightful! I love the way you fluffed it up without turning it into a piece of licorice. I always wince when the fluff is too... too... much. Do you get my drift? *g*<br>
<br>
Anyway this is the perfect formula. It's not too sickeningly sweet and everyone remained in general character without undying professions as such. But the reader knows Lex cares.<br>
<br>
I am almost sad that arrogant Lucas did not pop up again, but it was a short fic (gasp) and it was logical.<br>

My Valentine by Kris &amp; Peggy<br>
I knew before I started reading this that it would be wonderful, because it was written by two of the best Chlex authors in existence, and I was not wrong. This story had everything needed for a perfect romantic piece and it was all just beautiful. I laughed when they had a snowball fight, I smiled when they admitted their feelings and I <br>
almost cried with the emotion when she sang to him and when he asked her to marry him. I hope you two decide to write together again soon, because you've done an incredible job with this.<br>

And I know you did it for plot purposes---so we would yell yeah---when Clark is finally taken care of.

Take notes, people----the mark of a good writer is to convince people of the stories validity and also to create different feelings for a character you love---and yet those feelings change from story to story, within the writers universe and outside of it.

Aww Gabe is the sweet protective father again. But now Lionel rivals him in likeability! I'd like to see more of Lex and Jack's interaction soon though. Liking the whole pissed off but still cool Lex.<br>

Wow Kris. For a fic this long it's still progressing admirably well. I was a bit sad that the results could be negative but hearing Lex say that.. Awww... Of course, I remember a Friends ep when Phoebe told Rachel the test was negative and that was when Rachel realized she really wanted the <br>
baby. It turned out Phoebe was testing her. So I guess whether the test is negative or positive then this period will help her decide what she really wants. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Hey there ,<br>
<br>
I've just recently begun to read Smallvillefics (Smallville has just begun airing 4 weeks ago here in Germany), but since I'm a quick reader I've read a lot of them in that month. And I have to say, I really, really like your stories. All of them, whether it's the 'Lana zone' or 'Amour Noire'. I love your writing style, and the way you portray the characters. And I can't wait for the next part of 'Accidents happen', by the way ;o) , that's another wonderfully written  and funny story.<br>
<br>
If you're still reading this: Keep up your great work and I'm looking forward to reading more of your stories!  <br>
<br>

Consequences by Scifichick774<br>
OMG. Poor Chloe. She must be very sick after spending the night in that cold weather. It was so sweet seing Lex there worried about her. I hope she believes the nurse about Lex's feelings... I wish I had him there worring for me... LOL<br>
I usually like Gabe but he was an ass with Chloe. Why can't he understand that she would never lie to him about being engaged and the most important that she's feeling betrated because of Clark and Lana thing. I don't think that she's reacting very normal but it's her right to be angry with the man she likes and don't want her and with the woman that this man wants. Every human been would feel bad about this situation.<br>
I want to see this ball... I'm so curious about it.<br>

&quot;Be nice,&quot; she said in a hushed warning voice.  &quot;I'm hoping that<br>
Jerome's cousins will influence him in a positive manner and perhaps he'll consider courting me soon.&quot;<br>

Welcome To My World (Part 15) by Kris<br>
Is Chloe in this world blind or stupid? Does she not understand that Alex doesn't want Jerome, or anyone else, to like her? Oh well, great chapter. Gotta feel sorry for Lana tied up in that dress! Looking forward to more of this one soon.<br>

That was such a great chapter!!!!  It's about time Chloe started to realize that Lex is HOT, and she should be with him, because he really cares for her.  I love it, but i'd probably love the next chapter more. (grins) <br>

Kris, <br>
<br>
That kiss gave me the shivers . . . very sweet!  I hope Chloe listens to that nurse.  Then again, I want to see them at the ball - you're really building up the suspense.  More ASAP!!  Of course, after you update Sibling Rivalry, Accidents Happen, WTMW, and Lovestruck.  Wow, I don't know how you do it.  I can barely manage two at a time! <br>

Thank you so much!!<br>
 <br>
You have no idea how much it means to me that such a talented (that's gotta be the understatement of the century!) writer such as yourself actually likes my stories. Are you sure you didn't misread it?? Maybe if you take a second look, you realize its shittiness and high junk-factor.... (still in the denial-phase, here)<br>
 <br>
My favourite fanfics are written by you. I worship you. I worship the keyboard you type on.<br>
 <br>
But enough of that, cuz you're probably getting pretty sick of people telling you how wonderful you are day in and day out....<br>
 <br>
Uhm...where was I before the whole you-know? Oh yeah! Your fanfics! I just love consequences. It's fantastic how you portray Lionell in this fic. At first, you totally fooled me. I really thought the oldest Luthor wanted our favourite reporter for himself. Only later did I realize that he's trying to get her together with his son! (I'm gonna feel so incredibly stupid if I'm wrong about this)<br>
 <br>
The Gatehouse Series has also gotten my attention. It's good to know that if I accidentily fall through an interdimensional portal (or visit my grandma's house), there will still be Chlex, no matter what horrifying, anti-fanfiction (now, that's just cruel!) universe I'm in. Although, the evil Clark-thing kinda freaked me out.<br>
 <br>
me: &quot;Yes! Another chapter of Sibling Rivalry! Yes! more Chlex! Jess, come see this!!<br>
Jess: *burying herself deeper under the cushions* Leave me alone.<br>
^ this is practically my reaction to (surprise, surprise) Sibling Rivalry!<br>
 <br>
I could go on like this for hours, but I really don't want to keep you from your writing. I really, really don't! Again, thanx for reading my humble fanfics and I hope to read more from you soon.<br>
 <br>
Love,<br>

Awwww----sweetie---after that little piece of Chlexy heaven, the only thing that would get me mad is if they got into an accident and both died. I don't read CD's ever again. :: sigh :: I loved this part, Kris. Really loved it. &lt;g&gt; Prolific Peggy, who still has to read the last part to your other story, that's not Consequences.  <br>

Oh sweetie---this is going to be so much fun to read. : ) And if you want any ideas from me to drive Lex crazy---heehee---just e-mail me. And the first one----99 bottles of beer on the wall---going through Chloe's mind. &lt;g&gt; Sorry, couldn't resist that one. &lt;bg&gt; Wow----this is a really great start, hon. I really needed a laugh right about now. And an idea---I need a story idea.
