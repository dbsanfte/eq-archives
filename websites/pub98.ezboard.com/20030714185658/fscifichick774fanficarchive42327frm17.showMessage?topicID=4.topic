Awwww---bad germs, bad, bad, bad, germs.....grrrrrr. Take your time, sweetie. Health is so much more important than a story. And speaking of stories, liked the last chapter of AH---fiance don't you mean---okay, when the hell did you ask me to marry you and when did I say yes? And then he asks her and stupid Lionel has to ruin the moment. :: sigh :: The man is on the top ten most wanted list of Smallville, right? And number two--she who's name we will no longer speak---in honor of Sabby---who's really pissed at her right now. Loved it sweetie---loved them, hated Lionel----and I read the last chapter to SR and let me tell you, Lucas is really getting on my nerves---hope Lex gives him a licking so he won't be ticking for a while. Hit him and then send him to the institute; maybe he can have the room next door to his mother. :: grrrrrr :: Talk to you later. Your friend, Peggy. <br>

Hey, uh, this is Michelle, ignore the email address, i think this is my dad's...Anyways, I love Beloved (hehe) it's darker than your other fics. Maybe Lucas should attempt to rape her due to his obsession, she should escape (obviously) and I know she'll be the one to save Lex from his tormented life. You should keep going back to the normal world, because it's interesting to see the people's reaction, i don't know why <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Anyway, sure Lucas is hot, but Lex is downright *sinful* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I can tell this is gunna be one of those long fics coz she hasn't met Lex yet and it'll be hard to tear down that hard exterior, but I have full confidence in this fic, this'll be one that we'll be hearing about for a long time.<br>

OK, for some reason, Lucas is *really* getting on my nerves, I mean, the man is deranged! killing those guys should really put Chloe off him, shouldn't it? And the fact that he would kill his family, *Lex* in that family, is really putting me off any Chlucas shipping i may have had. But I really liked the short but sweet almost-chlex scene. i know this isn't going to be fully chlex for a long time, but just keep giving us scenes like this and i'll be fine!...for a while <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Also, Lana and her blubbering and that officer Adams chick is *really* pissing me off...but in a good way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Well, cya, the fic ROCKS!<br>

how Lex saw Chloe. It's enchantment and Peeping Tom at the <br>

First off, hurray for Chloe saying she can't pronounce the little floaty thing's name. I am not alone!<br>
Next, the entire conversation between Lex and Chloe about Lena and the cabin was very humorous and funny. I actually would adore a future part where they do look for a cabin. It's going to be so fun. They're gonna be cheating fate now because they might feel that they can make love anywhere except for a cabin and they won't conceive <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Okay, was about to work on our collaboration when I Imed with Sabby and she wants a sequel to a challenge I did for her and has yet to show up onlist. BTW----hint---when it's her birthday, write Sabby a piece with Lucas in it. &lt;g&gt; So then, I was sidetracked by the next part of AH and---Kris! Again? She's pregnant. &lt;g&gt; Not that I'm complaining----heehee---at least it's not icky Helen. Ewwwwww----now that's an awful thought----Helen pregnant with Lex's----uuuuugh! Okay. Love what you are doing with the piece, sweetie. : ) Can't wait to read more and I'm betting everybody else is jumping to this conclusion too. However---is it possible for her to be pregnant? I mean, how long has it been since they, you know. And how long does it take to show up? Course, this is smallville and the goop might have caused her to show faster. &lt;g&gt; Well, talk to you later. And I don't hate you, sweetie---none of us do----maybe a little irked by the cliffhanger but you are the queen of cliffhangers. : ) And this was so much better than last nights eppy, I bet. : ) Still hemming and hawwing as to whether to watch it or not. Getting conflicting perceptions of her in this one---well, everybody agrees that she's in cohots with somebody. I think the conflicting that's going on is that some say she's acting like a bad clone of Chloe and some say she's a whiny Lana. So, which is it. Maybe that's why nobody likes her---she doesn't have her own personality and she just ruin's Lex's personality when she's around.  Oh, love your insights into Helen, Kris. Your friend, Peggy.<br>

Ok, I know I've been slipping on the feedback.  So here is my attempt to play catch up.<br>
<br>
SR<br>
<br>
Way to end it.  I like Lex pushing for Chloe to have his child one day.<br>
<br>
Beloved<br>
<br>
Ok, so not expecting that.  Chloe is actually in her right dimension.  And how cruel was that of her &quot;parents&quot; to switch her in the first place.  I know they were trying to protect her but to sentence the other to death.  I can't wait to see how Chloe takes it.<br>
<br>
The Curse<br>
<br>
Two whole chapters.  And yes, Chloe knows!  Her evil smirk when she said she was going to tell Lex was just tooo cute.  (What can I say, I have a soft spot for evil Chloe.)  So looking forward to more of this one.<br>
<br>
Night Cap<br>
<br>
Hmmm, a darker fic from you no less.  (That alone is reason to read.)  I read the beginning and am intrigued.  I will definitely be reading more of this one.  I wanna see where you take it.<br>
<br>
Ok, I think that's all I need to catch up on.  Let me know if I<br>
missed anything.  Hope you are feeling better.<br>
<br>
Imp<br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
FB: Nightcap <br>
<br>
I...uh...I....*releases breath*...<br>
<br>
I can see why you said this would be a dark fic.  However, it's a well written dark fic.  Truthfully, I'm enjoying it so far.  Lex's<br>
repeated nightmare's of raping Chloe were both disturbing and<br>
heartbreaking.  You are doing a great job of portraying the fine line he walks between darkness and light.  <br>
<br>
I like how you brought in Chloe's cousins.  Tying it in with her<br>
family tree project was a great idea.  And her bitterness at Lana's seeming ability to find a common ground with anyone, (I think she must be a meteor freak), while she herself doesn't seem to be able to do that was spot on.  <br>
<br>
Oh and I have to say, just for the record, Lionel is an evil bastard.<br>
<br>
I look forward to reading more of this.<br>

You're going to find this one a tad different from my usual fbs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
If you will allow me to put my workshop critic cap on, read on.<br>
If you want my usual fb, scroll down to after the line.<br>
 <br>
I learned in fiction class that when you put certain scenes in<br>
a story, you better have once damn good reason or else you<br>
are only working to lengthen a work which could have done <br>
better if said in one sentence or scene. You're supposed to <br>
extend a description when every word throbs with allusion or<br>
a reference to the theme. This is probably one of the reasons <br>
why I don't do graphic sex scenes unless it does more than<br>
say that the characters had sex.<br>
 <br>
This is not to say that I do not enjoy the occasional smut. Fan<br>
fiction is entertainment, much like all those romance pocketbooks I devoured years ago.<br>
 <br>
That scene in Nightcap for which you warned your readers is<br>
actually the most logical insertion of a graphic scene I've read.<br>
It's not just for smut. It goes a long way in the development of whatever conflict will arise, it already casts light on a side of the shadow you are creating for Lex's character, and a contrast between what was going on in Lex's mind and the bright smile Chloe greeted him with in the Talon. There was the reason, the discomfort and the tension rolled into one. I really have to say that I appreciate the fact that this is not gratuitous rape reference, or even gratuitous smut for that matter. It's actually used to propel the plot, and that's<br>
more than welcome for me.<br>
<br>
 <br>
If I bored you with the above, just tell me *g* I've only ever done an overcritical analysis with Lucy plotwise, Adeylan plotwise, Cam and Humbug in the voices they used. And I totally hope you did not take that to mean I do not enjoy resolution smut. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Because as a fanfic reader, I adore those...<br>
 <br>
Now taking the CW cap off... So this is like my usual feedback... <br>
 <br>
Lex is going to the party then... He's going to Clark's property where Chloe is most likely going to be... That's where his dreams are set right? Ooooh.. I wonder why exactly these nightmares are recurring. Are you one of the evil Lex is hot Lex type of people? I've pegged you for a multishipper, as am I, but I never did ask if you adored the total Dark!Lex. <br>
 <br>
More soon...<br>

Hello sweetie,<br>
<br>
really no time to talk, exams etc. But I couldn't let two brill <br>
chapters of the curse go by without giving you a virtual pat on the back. Only I won't let it be too hard since I heard you were sick, hope you're felling better now and that it wasn't anything serious.<br>
<br>
Poor Chloe with the sabby/lucas image; great touch.<br>
Porr Lex, i'm feeling all thses maternal feelings towards him, hope they find a cure, but he stays addicted to chloe anyway.<br>

Hope to read more soon *Coughunstublehintcough*<br>

p.s a new 'In the dark' chapter is haunting me, and I'm trying very hard to resist, darn exams =) but they'll be over soon and I'll have a whole year (sandwich course, work for a year therefore no homework, therefore evenings free for witing, yeah!) in which to scribble!<br>

Just wanted to say that I have been reading &quot;Beloved&quot; and &quot;The Curse&quot; and I really enjoy both. I only hope that in &quot;Beloved&quot; Chloe is able to return to the Smallville we know of. I also really enjoyed the Gatehouse series. So keep it up so I can feed my Chlex addiction<br>

Hi!  You are my favorite fanfiction writer(The CHLEX stuff) I was wondering if you could do me a HUGE favor.  Would you possibly be willing to send me a copie of &quot;the misadventures of....and Beloved....and any new fic or updates?  I recently had my computer crash and so now I'm using my aunts and she has this wicked firewall that doesn't allow  any of my favorite websites to display.  Fanfiction.net isn't allowed through because they have adware and the like monitoring all users.  And that darn overprotective firewall won't let me visit! Anyway if you can, that would be much appreciated!  Thank you so very much,  Jen<br>

The Deal<br>
<br>
ok, first off why doesn't it surprise me that Bruce is just as<br>
possessive and suspicious as Lex is?  I liked the fact Chloe forced Bruce to ask her dad over the phone.  That was too cute.<br>
<br>
TCMMOMM<br>
<br>
Lionel all protective of his granddaughter was just too sweet.  Which is not a word I would have thought I would use for Lionel.  But I like that side of him.  And of course Pete.  Wanting to see Lex get yelled at by Gabe was just, classic Pete.  But really, did the dragon have to eat him?  Lana ok.  (and I hope the Dragon didn't get indigestion.)  But Pete?  <br>
<br>
Looking forward to reading more of these and all your other stories.<br>

 Well now I have the urge to smack Lucas *does just that* this curse wasn't such a good idea after all, and now Lex is all sick because of it! Gotta do something about that! I hope Chloe won't totally explode when she finds out. Why can't Lucas at least keep his mouth shut *smacks him again* I hope the updates keep coming like that, though I hope to see more Beloved soon<br>

Whoo hoo!  Go, reporter Chloe, go!  Poor, poor Lex.  All drugged up and nowhere to go. ^_~  I'm sure Chloe touching him isn't making the situation any better, either.  Call me twisted, but I can't help thinking that it's kind of sweet that he's so adamantly denying that Chloe could be his sister. ^_^  And Lucas . . . *heavy sigh*  Sabby, I leave Lucas in your capable hands.  Do something about him, would you? ^_~<br>

Loved chapter 8 too, aww Lex, I'm atually really feeling sorry for the physical illness he's feeling, poor guy,but his fault for looking up Lucas I guess, should have left him to the slums of edgecity.<br>
<br>
I'm so glad I have great fics like your to get me through the <br>
endofyearexamscramsessions, it's never fun, on top of that I'm not well, haven't been for a while and just don't seem to be getting better, doctors stink ^_^<br>
<br>
As to Smallville the tv show, they're runing my favourite <br>
obsession!!**sob** I can't take much more of this pink princess crap, so yeah! to fanfic that keeps me interested...<br>
<br>
Anyways back to revision for now, expect to see another chapter of mine soon, although I don't know when the next update after that will be since I don't write very well when I'm stressed. Need more curse to keep me going <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Wow, that was great. The plot throughout was very good and the story never got boring. <br>
<br>
I enjoyed how it was humorous in the beginning then got into the plot. Sometimes people get into the plot too early and it gets too serious too early (either that or they have no plot). But congrats you pulled it off wonderfully.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The ending was incredible, perfect. Lionel got what he deservers and Lex gets to enjoy it all. Psycho indecisive Clark finally gets his mind back on Lana. It was all worth reading.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Aside from the story youre a great writer. I didnt notice any errors and I was completely involved in the story and didnt have to think what the heck is she trying to say?<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I stupidly gave up fanfics for lent ( it was horrible horrible torture) so I have no idea when this story was finished.  But at least I know it was worth it and I got to read everything in one go so no cliffhangers for me!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I see you have about 24 smallville fics and Ive read most, so it the rest are like the ones Ive read theyll be great. I especially like your humor romance but the angst romance always gets me really into it, and usually riled up *sigh* but I guess thats a good thing when writers get responses from their readers.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Anyway Ill go read now, theyre calling me<br>
<br>
  <br>
<br>
Keep writing,<br>

Mwah hah hah hah!  Oh, Lex is gonna be piiiiiiiiiissed. ^_^  And I can't wait to see it!  Lucas better pray he can find a counter-curse, or I'm thinking he won't be much good to Sabby anymore. ^_~  And I'm sure Lex would be willing to do something about Chloe never having a date again.  More <br>

 Oh this is getting good! And I sure as hell no Sabby won't stop playing matchmaker, just cause Luke is saying so *g* At least Lucas got the main telling off! Now a counter curse eh? I thought there was none?<br>
 <br>
Whatever, hope you update soonish, cause I can't wait to find out how Lex will react when he finds out that he's been cursed by a wicca *g* Or doesn't he find out?<br>
