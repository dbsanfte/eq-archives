As previously mentioned, Sheri only wanted to know where are all the other competative teams?  Why don't they come to Northside to play?  She never said all the other teams are &quot;sorry&quot;.  We sure haven't heard anyone talking bad about Overstack's comments.  Furthermore,  The Violators only play on Wednesday night.  Friday night is The Knights... mostly the same people but with different coaches.  So NCSOFTBALL...chew on that for awhile.  One more thing...please note the date of Overstacked's post is dated earlier than Sheri's.<br>

 Our team name is Overstacked. No we don't always win the league, but if you want good competition you need to go to Boomer. Northside is mainly for rec teams and work teams. I think that right there says why Northside don't have many very good teams. Every league seams like it comes down to 2 teams that dominate. I don't think that its very fun playing one good team and 5 or 6 sorry teams every season. I'd rather play 4-5 good teams.  <br>

I've been playing softball at Northside for 18 years.  It's my home field.  I was playing there when it was the Northside Y.  Yeah there is a difference in fences, but Northside makes allowances for that too with homerun exceptions.  So if Northside is strictly business or rec as you say it is...then make it a closed league (played on one of those, too).  FURTHERMORE, ARE YOU SPEAKING FOR THE MANAGEMENT AT NORTHSIDE?  Until then, I think everyone is invited to play, so bring the competition to us....to OUR home fields.  We all started out at Northside, we live close to Northside.  Point of fact...one competitive team from Boomer came over last year to play Monday nights and quickly left before the season was over.  Don't believe me...ask Mr. Payne.  DOES MANAGEMENT AT NORTHSIDE WANT THEIR COMPLEX TO BE KNOWN AS STRICTLY REC AND COMPANY/CHURCH LEAGUES????

off i'd like to say thank you the the dude or dudes that came up with this board.  it is definitely great for oklahoma.  secondly let me say thanks for keeping northside near the top of the board.  any publicity is supposed to be good pub.  let me say that the comments are very interesting up to this point.  many are valid, many are not.  when this whole thing came about i talked with sherri and she said it got blown completely out of proportion.  all she was trying to do was find some more comp teams for them to play &quot;IN A LEAGUE AT NORTHSIDE&quot;.  everybody is fully aware that there is more comp on the tournament scene.  not as much as there should be, but is generally at any given event going to be better than the same ole league night.  i would also like to see more comp teams at northside.  and i might add that we are currently taking signups for the summer league as we speak and we do offer 3 hr's in the comp league.  violators and overstacked are two very good league teams.  we have good teams on friday night as well.  northside is not billed as rec park.  we advertise to rec and comp teams and who ever has the money in the hand gets on the board and that is how the leagues flow.  yes we do have 4-5 church teams so i guess that would definitely make us a church league park.  our work teams probably number around 15-20, so i guess we are mainly a church/rec park.  well that is only about 20% of our teams.  so i guess those assumptions would be wrong.  we do have more rec teams than comp in coed only.  we have much more upper mens teams than we do lower and i would put many of them up against some of the strongest c teams around.  many of our mens teams that are good usually do play in tournaments, they just combine to make their teams.  if you have ever been in the business ( and most people think they have, or could do better) you would soon recognize that the leagues are what pay the bills and not the tournaments.  looking at our tournaments schedule as mentioned, we don't have one.  we figured out that as long as boomer is around (even before we purchased it) that most teams do play there for tournaments.  so we have focused on youth fastpitch and boys baseball.  it works for us as a complex.  we have in the past tried to give away bat bags, t-shirts, the regular stuff and people just don't come.  that is ok.  northside has consistently been in the top four in usssa registrations each year usually behind boomer and carl smith.  we do have a place in this world.  we may not have the longest fences, we may not have the state of the art lighting, but we are located close to many people and this is the park that they like to play at.  we also draw teams from all over the metro each season.  one thing we do have, if i might give it up to myself, is the greenest freaking grass around.  now i did get lucky with the timely rains and fertilizing right before one of those nice soakers.  but check back with me in august and it will be YELLOW.  i try my best, but summers are hard.  as i finish this book i am writing, yes a team did come from boomer last fall to try to tune up for the state tournament.  and yes as soon as the tournament was over they quit showing up.  it was a 4 team league that quickly became 3 and that is hard to do.  i will say that they did take care of all their financial obligations including umpire fees.  so no hard feelings from the park.  we just wish they would have stuck it out and didn't use the excuse that the umps didn't like them.  i've been around this game for almost 15 years and not everybody is going to like our park.  i know people that hate boomer, people that hate usa, and that people hate northside.  can you feel the love.  as park operators it is a business.  and most of you that have never seen the inner workings of a small business have no clue how hard it is to run it.  but we get by.  i've been with northside for over 11 years now and have really enjoyed it.  what i miss the most is seeing the players.  since i don't work many nights i miss you guys.  even the quitters and whiners.  now as i close please understand that we welcome the talk on the boards, we welcome the criticism.  but if you truly want answers to your pot shots or questions, please don't hide behind a computer and talk smack.  have a set and leave your name and number.  better yet call me at the ballpark and we can get it on.  i would leave you my cell number but then you would be like overstacked softball and call me everytime it is raining.  just kidding lee.  we love all you guys.  the landscape of softball has changed over the last ten years.  used to be all there was to do was play ball.  now people have jet-skis, internet, 256 channel digital cable and so many other things to do with their time.  and who can afford to keep up with the technology?  the economy also has something to do with, disposable income is down, and if i quote my neighbor it is all george@#$%^bush's fault the economy sucks.  this isn't a politiacal board so we won't go there.  one last thought.  softball is just a slower form of baseball, which is a kids sport.  lets not act like kids.  remember it is just a game, and i bet everyone of you reading this has to go to work tomorrow where real life is played out.  thanks for listening.  720-2255 for more information on league or just to talk.   thanks dave  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek

Yes we went to Northside to play on some dirt and get ready for State there ( although it didnt help) lol. when the tournament was over we did leave. it was to far north for many of our players and we were having a lot of trouble getting players there on time. We did have some problems with a couple of the umpires, and there was only four teams including ourselves. when we combined all of the problems we were facing it was beneficial to us to just exit the scene. the teams we played in that league were awesome it was some great competion, i wished we could make a full league with that great of competion.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=129.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=129.topic&start=41&stop=42>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=129.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=129.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=129.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.threadControl?topicID=129.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/baseball/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=129.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=129.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="oklahomasoftballfrm2">Oklahoma Softball<option value="oklahomasoftballfrm9">Buy/Sell/Trade<option value="oklahomasoftballfrm10">Find a Team/Player<option value="oklahomasoftballfrm1">Announcements<option value="oklahomasoftballfrm6">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B0000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball>Oklahoma Softball</a><font color=#8B0000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2>Oklahoma Softball</a> <font color=#8B0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
