C-D Equa.</span><hr size=1> I just want to add my oppinion on why some teams wont step up and play C &amp; D Tournaments. Last year, I played Class E, and we played alot of D tournaments all over, but with some of the teams, they know they just cant compete in that level of play and dont want to waste there money on something that they feel they will go 0-2 . I will use this for an example. Last year at carl smith in the pre season tournament, Alcohol fuled played OSC, The pitcher from Alcohol Fuled took a line drive to the right eye brow and hurt him bad, now the guy that hit the ball did not do this intentionally, but it happened and a this is why some teams dont play upper tournaments,whether it be for money or of fear of getting hurt. I had guys on my team that griped about playing Class D tournaments last year because we were A class E team, but how does anybody ever going to get any better if they dont try better competition. I know that my team would get in it, but I have to many people that have kids in sports right now and that comes first to them so We will have to make it another time. And I know that some of you feel that if somebody is in fear of getting hurt that they should take up another sport or position for that matter. But accidents do happen to the best of us sometimes, And there are some teams that do go pitcher hunting to, and that is what makes the game of softball not fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=meat03osc>meat03osc</A></span><br> Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/14/04 8:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=895.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  COMMENT</span><hr size=1> I WAS THERE, WHEN DUDE GOT HIT.

And NO, his mouth did not cause this to happen, but I have played with and against him before and I know how he is, VERY MOUTHY, sometimes, and he cant understand why people hit at him. I would never stand on the mound and run my mouth like what he has before, it is not healthy to do so. And YES, your team should have your back if it becomes a middle war, I know if they start blasting me this year, K-BOB, B.J. and a few others of the noles will have my back, I can promise you that. But I hope it doesnt come to that at all, because you are right, that is what makes the game of softball unsafe and this is what gets people hurt. You and me both know as pitchers that there are teams out there that do go head hunting and there are teams that can be assholes abut it also.
