<br>
The acolyte shivered as he heard his mistress call him.  So soft was her voice, she never raised it, but her tone demanded respect.  He set down his book and hurried to her side at the experimental table.  On the table were masses of spell components, spellbooks, small dead animal waiting for dissection and analysis.  She was currently bent over the body of a bullfrog, peeling away its layers of slimy, bumpy skin to reveal its heart that was still beating and sending blood to its parts.  He shuddered at the sight, having a weak stomach.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Mistress?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Open the door.&quot;  She never even looked up from her diligent work.  &quot;There is someone coming.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh! Yes, Mistress Azalea.&quot; He hurried to the door, his own red robes flowing about him, and pulled open the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Azalea!&quot;<br>
<br>
A man burst through the door as it opened, sending the apprentice flying through the door.  He was a tall man, with silver hair and even purer silver eyes, dressed in a tunic and cape and flowing pants.  He wore a sabre at his side.  His face was contorted with anger as he made his way across the marble floor, which clattered loudly with his footsteps.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello, Sir Kuja,&quot; she said calmly, never even looking up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't fool with me, black witch!&quot; he snarled.  He grabbed her hand roughly and turned her around.  &quot;You promised me they would not fail! You told me Kyonae Falcona would be captured!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I promised you nothing,&quot; Azalea said cooly, her dark greyblue eyes roaming his face.  &quot;The elf cast black magic of her own.  Unfortunately, an elven black spell is always stronger against those of human mages.  As for her being captured, that is your own troop's fault.  They were obviously too weak.  Now, if you excuse me, I must return to my work.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To hell with your work!&quot; he growled, jerking her near him.  &quot;We had a deal, black witch!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What deal?&quot; she hissed.  &quot;I help you and I live.  It makes me laugh.  I could kill you without a thought.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And I you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Azalea's eyes flickered blue black.  &quot;Let go of my arm, Sir Kuja,&quot; she warned calmly.<br>

Her dark blue eyes widened, and she rushed inside, though she was aware that it was none of her business.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is going on here?!&quot; She said assertively. The young woman placed her hands on hips, briefly brushing a lock of raven-black hair out of her face with a delicate hand. She looked sternly at the man with cold, silver eyes. &quot;What do you think you are doing?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/5/03 11:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm122.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Black Magic</span><hr size=1> Kuja and Azalea glared towards the raven-haired woman, Azalea's eyebrows raising slightly, and Kuja's face turnign upward in a snarl, as if about to reprimand the mage for interrupting matters that weren't her own.  But then, the grimace curled up coolly into a sweet smile, and he finally, and abruptly, let go of Azalea's thin arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;And who is this?&quot; he purred, walkins swiftly and silently until he was before the woman, his eyes glimmering with intrigue.  &quot;I am familiar with this Tower, but I have never seen you before.  I am Commander Kuja.  It is an honor.&quot; He kissed her hand politely, never taking his eyes off hers as he did so.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is Sorena Aries, a very skilled mage,&quot; Azalea answered him calmly.  &quot;And she has better things to do than to stand around having her hand ravished by your vile mouth.  This is a place of magic, and intelligence, not testosterone.  So if you have made your point, Sir Kuja, you should leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kuja turned aorund and snarled at the black mage, who stood so calmly without fear.  &quot;I have yet to make my point, dear Azalea,&quot; he said so sickly sweet.  &quot;For you see, I am a Chosen.  I have the blood of a god.  You dare to tempt me?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A god has no blood,&quot; Azalea laughed harshly.  &quot;And so cannot bleed.  But you can.  So be gone, or my acolyte shall have a floor to clean tonight.&quot; <br>
<br>
Kuja drew his sabre and lunged at her.  &quot;Why you ignorant witch!  You will pay for defying Osiri--&quot;<br>
<br>
With a mere gesture of Azalea's hand Kuja was silenced, with a mere whisper of a word he choked on those unsaid words, and with a blink of her greyblue eyes he slammed back into the wall hard, flying past Sorena and hitting his destination with a sickening thud.<br>

Kuja struggled to his feet, seething in rage.  &quot;It's not over yet, Azalea!  By the damned gods, it's not!&quot; he shrieked, before turning abruptly and storming out the door, slamming it behind him and making the many beakers on the tables and shelves shimmer with vibration.<br>
<br>
Azalea sighed, as if pondering on the commander wasn't worth the time spent away from her studies.  &quot;What a child,&quot; she said.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kalirandone>Kali Randone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/7/03 9:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm122.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Black Magic</span><hr size=1> &quot;What a child,&quot; Azalea stated.<br>

The frog was dead.  &quot;Damn,&quot; she cursed silently under her breath.  &quot;Stupid Osirians...&quot;  She traveled to the other side of the room, pullign another frog from the tank and discarding the dead one into thin air.  <br>

<br>
Whipping a pair of reading spectacles from what seemed to be right of of the air, she glanced at Sorena.  &quot;I was curious...because it has come to my attention that the Empire that enslaved you and your people is regrouping.  They are making allies with the Osirians...and becoming stronger as we speak.  They have already, as I've heard, captured many of the Exilians and have imprisoned them again.  Or have put them to death.&quot;  She set the book on a table and opened its old, withering pages.  &quot;It has also come to my attention, that you have a brother...Darion?  He was in Exile also.
