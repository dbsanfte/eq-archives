<br>
CAMP BUSHMASTER, Iraq - In this dry desert world near Najaf, where the Army V Corps combat support system sprawls across miles of scabrous dust, there's an oasis of sorts: a 500-gallon pool of pristine, cool water.<br>
<br>
It belongs to Army chaplain Josh Llano of Houston, who sees the water shortage, which has kept thousands of filthy soldiers from bathing for weeks, as an opportunity.<br>
<br>
''It's simple. They want water. I have it, as long as they agree to get baptized,'' he said.<br>
<br>
And agree they do. Every day, soldiers take the plunge for the Lord and come up clean for the first time in weeks.<br>
<br>
''They do appear physically and spiritually cleansed,'' Llano said.<br>
<br>
First, though, the soldiers have to go to one of Llano's hour-and-a-half sermons in his dirt-floor tent. Then the baptism takes an hour of quoting from the Bible.<br>
<br>
''Regardless of their motives,'' Llano said, ``I get the chance to take them closer to the Lord.''<br>
<br>
A blue-eyed 32-year-old with an abundance of energy, Llano goes out every day to drum up grimy soldiers for his pool.<br>
<br>
He talks to truck drivers, tank drivers, computer specialists -- anyone and everyone. He goes out to the combat zone to the fighting soldiers and the combat support soldiers who keep them in supplies.<br>
<br>
''You have to be aggressive to help people find themselves in God,'' he said.<br>
<br>
He calls himself a ''Southern Baptist evangelist,'' and justifies the war and killing with a verse from the Gospel of Matthew, which he often recites: ``Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's.<br>
<br>
''This means we are called upon by our government to fight and that is giving unto Caesar, as the Bible tells us,'' he said.<br>
<br>
Earlier this week, word went out that portable showers might be installed here soon, but Llano was undaunted.<br>
<br>
''There is no fruit out here, and I have a stash of raisins, juice boxes and fruit rolls to pull out,'' the chaplain said optimistically.<br>

This is the line that killed me.  The role of an Army chaplain is not to convert, but to comfort - no matter the religion.<br>
<br>
Providing comfort would be to offer the soldiers a chance to bathe, and then attend a service if they would like to.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Onward Christian soldiers, cynically to war <br>
April 11, 2003<br>
BY CATHLEEN FALSANI RELIGION WRITER<br>
<br>
At Camp Bushmaster near the town of Najaf in the Iraqi desert, American soldiers who haven't been able to bathe in months can take a dip in a 500- gallon tub, courtesy of U.S. Army Chaplain Josh Llano.<br>
<br>
But there's an unusual entry fee: Conversion by full submersion.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's simple,&quot; Llano told a reporter for the Miami Herald last week. &quot;They want water. I have it, as long as they agree to get baptized.&quot; <br>
<br>
What a deal! One bath for the low, low price of your eternal soul.<br>
<br>
Before the soldiers can wash off some of the filth of desert warfare, they also have to sit through Llano's 90-minute sermon. And then comes the hourlong baptism/bath.<br>
<br>
&quot;They do appear physically and spiritually cleansed,&quot; said Llano, who is a Southern Baptist. &quot;Regardless of their motives, I get to take them closer to the Lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
The only place Llano is taking these guys is to the spiritual cleaners. And I don't mean that in a cute, evangelical way.<br>
<br>
They're tired. They're far from home. Sand gets EVERYWHERE. And in the middle of a desert water shortage, Chaplain Sneakypants has a big tub of relief. But it'll cost ya.<br>
<br>
That's the kind of thing that, as Annie Lamott says, &quot;would make Jesus drink gin out of a cat dish.&quot;<br>
<br>
What is it that makes some Christians feel Jesus has to somehow be sold, like a health club membership, or sneaked into allegedly altruistic humanitarian efforts like protein powder into a double-thick chocolate shake?<br>
<br>
And what is it about war that brings out spiritual opportunism?<br>
<br>
In the last week or so, many evangelical Christian groups have announced their intentions to help--and help evangelize--post-war Iraq.<br>
<br>
The Rev. Franklin Graham (Billy's son) announced that his organization, Samaritan's Purse, intended to bring humanitarian aid to Iraq. He also said it was an opportunity to evangelize.<br>
<br>
The International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention said it plans to send volunteers to Iraq to provide food, shelter and &quot;true freedom in Jesus Christ.&quot;<br>
<br>
The International Bible Society has printed a Scripture booklet especially for Iraqi refugees.<br>
<br>
&quot;This always happens in the wake of war,&quot; said Ken Vaux, my old professor of Christian ethics at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston. &quot;Subliminal to all war is a secret hope for conversion. It's usually a hope for the secular derivatives of the faith, not the faith itself. We hope for a different kind of society to emerge in Iraq.&quot;<br>
<br>
This time around, there seems to be a not-so-hidden theological agenda. <br>
<br>
Capitalizing on the dire humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people for anything other than an opportunity to relieve their suffering is disgraceful. <br>
<br>
I suppose it's not surprising, however, considering President Bush's successful attempts to theologize the war. I mean, the man thinks God told him to do this, for heaven sakes.<br>
<br>
&quot;That makes the linking of evangelism and war philanthropy much more complex, and should lead us to much more humility about the gifts we offer,&quot; Vaux said. <br>
<br>
Before the war started, Tony Campolo, a leading evangelist and Christian commentator, said he believed the war would set back the cause of Christian missions by 1,000 years. <br>
<br>
And now, with Operation Iraqi Freedom seemingly nearing its end, and Operation Iraqi Conversion mustering at the borders, he seemed even more certain about that.<br>
<br>
&quot;We should do good simply for goodness' sake and not because we have an agenda of trying to manipulate people through charity into affirming our belief systems,&quot; Campolo was telling me Thursday. &quot;I can identify with the heart of Franklin Graham to win people to Jesus, but when you're doing humanitarian aid you are not to use any form of coercion and I think it is coercion when you are dealing with desperately hungry people and desperately needy people and tell them that the help comes only if they're willing to listen to your gospel message.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To make feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, or ministering to the sick contingent on a willingness to listen to a message that the needy might not want to listen to is oppressive and manipulative in a way that Jesus would not do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
That goes for bathtubs as well as rice sacks.<br>
<br>
According to the Gospel accounts, Jesus never bartered for grace. He didn't say, &quot;Hey, before I get you those loaves and fishes, and some salve for that nasty leprosy, I've got to tell you something.&quot;<br>
<br>
When people were hungry, he fed them. When they were sick, he healed them. And sometimes, the people Jesus helped didn't even know who he was.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

I've been wondering since I read the article what my DH would have done (he's ARMY), I know when he's been in desert conditions before he's complained that sand gets <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>everywhere</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and not being able to bathe even for a couple of days is really hard because of chaffing etc.<br>
<br>
After a couple of weeks... I even think he would be tempted to take the guy up.<br>

But to be honest, I guess I really shouldn't be surprised. DH was telling me that in basic training, if you went to church services you got time off from doing anything, but if you didn't go to church services you had to do chores and such back in the dorms. (Air Force basic). My husband who hadn't gone to church at that time in like 10 years went every weekend. He even started reading the bible. Now take that I rarely got to speak to my husband, only got two letters, when I saw him after basic was over I was in for a slight shock. And I was kind of concerned that my mostly antireligious (he doesn't like anyone including atheists) dh was quoting the bible to me. But it didn't take long before he was back to his usual self. <br>
<br>
Anyway, so I do know that in basic, religion of any sort got you free time, when lack of religion got you more work. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a chaplin would take advantage of soldiers like that. <br>
<br>
