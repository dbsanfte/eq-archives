We are fortunate to have such a great fihserie in our backyard but politics as with ALL POLITICS is for special interests.  I am not going to get on my soap box to critisize our fisherie managers but I will say this, &quot;the White River can be managed better for all fisherman&quot;.<br>
<br>
Case in point is that OUR River needs to go to slot limits:<br>
Browns over 21&quot; is harvestable and Rainbows 20&quot;.  This will produce a greater number of larger fish and the Fisherman wanting to take home supper can still harvest a nice mess.  It will take at least three years for the 8&quot;-10&quot; fish to grow to a harvestable size, but man the fisherie would be great.   Bigger and more fish = more fisherman from other areasand more fisherman = more money for ALL our business's related to our River.  This idea is not new, the Western States have use slot limits for years and Missouri @ Taneycomo has used it for 4 years and now can proclaim it as a great fisherie.<br>
<br>
Darrel Bowman and AGFC can save our Tax money and time by adopting slot limits now, not by patronizing everyone with some sort of Politcal cat &amp; mouse game!<br>
<br>
With slot limits Everyone is a winner, even Forrest Wood.<br>
<br>

We were talking about this over on the VFS (southern) board.  I've only fished Taney a few times, but it's obvious that the slots are working up there. I think the problem on the White would be that due to a lack of education and the nature of it, the bait fishermen kill about every fish they catch, doesn't matter if they keep them or not.  Possibly if it took a little longer for them to get a limit for lunch and a limit to take home, they would fish another part of the river. I'd like to see slots from the dam down to my place at Wildcat or even Cotter.  That would give Gaston Gas! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=danoinark>Danoinark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#000000>(8/11/03 7:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-7/265463/danofishin.jpeg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It could be a lot better...</span><hr size=1> Gary<br>

OK I'm with ya on the slot limits.  Phill Lilley has convinced me via reading his articles and fishing reports.  I would also really like to see Cane Island become a C&amp;R area.  I could also go for another reduction of the limit to 4 fish.  Gastons is coming around to the Idea of slot limits Steve.  This could be a big help.  Floated from Gastons down to cotter yesterday.  Once I got past hurst hole there basically weren't any fish.  The big fish were not in their usual haunts so I did a little scouting and still couldn't find very many.  I think I have a good Idea as to where they went and the slot limit thing may or may not help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyfishar>FlyFishAR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 426<br> <font color=#000000>(8/12/03 5:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.flyfishingarkansas.com/Photo%20Gallery/tn_j.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Jimmy:<br>
<br>
I'd like to see them expand the trophy areas as well. From what I've seen they are working extreamly well. Places like Cane Island, Wildcat, between the bridges at Cotter, extending the section at Rim up river, and perhaps even Buffalo Shoal, would all be candidates in my mind. At least to a one fish limit or a slot. Frankly I'd like to see all the trout rivers in Arkansas have a slot limit from one end to the other. It can be a very effective management tool.<br>
<br>
The river is improving again but will never be what it was before all the pressure hit it. The best way I can think of to improve the fishery is to reduce the pressure. Seeing what the first few miles of the San Juan are like should tell us something. That river is a prime example of C&amp;R practices. <br>
<br>
I don't want to jump too hard on what the AGFC has published in their goals. Frankly, so far I think they have done a pretty good job over all. The politics of the river will be &quot;very&quot; slow to change. The main thing I'm looking at is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>trend</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. As long as there is constant change in the direction of a better river, I'm happy. <br>

<br>
Having a person such as Mr. Gaston being in favor of slot limits would definately be a positive beginning.  I agree also, that maybe the right thing to do would be to enlarge or add additional C&amp;R areas through out the river.  I was fishing from Rim to Ranchette on Sunday and as we left Rim there was a fisherman just on the outside edge of the C&amp;R , we asked how he was doing and he held up 5-6 good fish  that looked like from 15&quot;-20&quot; fish. He said &quot;he had enough for supper&quot;.  I understand people, with me included, like to eat fish, but if we had slot limits 3 or four of those fish would have been let go and 2-3 would be enough for a mess.<br>
<br>
If Mr Bowman would call the Missouri Conservation Dept I am sure they would share any studies they have on their slot limit program on Taneycomo. Maybe that would speed up things.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=danoinark>Danoinark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#000000>(8/13/03 9:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-7/265463/danofishin.jpeg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: planning guys</span><hr size=1> I have always been a proponent of slot limits...I fish Taney alot and its definately working there.

Thanks for the reply.  I think everyone who has an interest in the White nad Norfork rivers should Heed Dano's advise and show up at the Mountain Home meeting.  Maybe I can bring a study from Mo G&amp;F. to give to Mr. Bowman.<br>

They introduced another C&amp;R area and were putting a measure to outlaw corn and chumming. At the time &quot;none&quot; of those objectives passed. Now years later they at least have the chumming and corn regs in place. If they are trying to bring things to change they will eventually, but it's about like watching paint dry. Actually paint dries alot faster.<br>
