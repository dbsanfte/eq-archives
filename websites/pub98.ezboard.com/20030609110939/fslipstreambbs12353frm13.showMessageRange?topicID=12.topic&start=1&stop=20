Vision-of-Faith II <br>
Keeper of the Way <br>
CY 9884 <br>
<br>
Chapter Eleven <br>
<br>
Nearly twenty systems had fallen to the Empire already in this short campaign. Along virtually every front little or no resistance had been offered to the onrush of Imperial military power. The Than species and the Neitzschean's has thus far produced the only noticeable fight A Than fleet was holding a small Imperial task force at bay in the Catrole system and the Drago-Kazov Nietzscheans were performing raids against military positions. Not one of the major powers in this part of space had formed any type of strong resistance to the Imperial onslaught. <br>
<br>
Captain Meduk supposed that this knowledge should have pleased her. Imperial forces were on the advance, new worlds and technology were being examined all with minimal loses. <br>
<br>
She could not help thinking about how she managed to get the command that brought her here. <br>
<br>
It had been a long road from her childhood to the command of a Imperial cruiser. Her father had been an Imperial Governor and using his influence had secured her a place at the academy on Carida. Graduating the academy with top marks didn't mean much for a woman in the Imperial Navy and so Tealara found herself shuffled off to various low priority assignments. Realizing that in order to get a timely promotion, Tealara found herself bribing superior officers in order to secure them. As she began to be promoted she found that the personal costs were getting overly excessive. She had done some things she was not proud of to get the promotions she deserved. <br>
<br>
The Starhammer was by far the easiest promotion she ever managed since leaving Carida. In a battle with a group of Rebel warships the Starhammer's former captain had been killed, Tealara as first officer stepped into position to take command. <br>
<br>
The crew wasn't following orders, and the ships second officer tried to take command. Faced with a dilemma Meduk did the only thing she could do, she shot him. It wasn't a killing shot but it was bad enough that he had to be dragged from the bridge. No one refused her orders after that. Ironically that same man was now her current first officer. <br>
<br>
&quot;Captain,&quot; Kelar reported, &quot;We have been ordered to join the offensive in the Catrole System, we are to leave immediately.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Very good Commander,&quot; she replied, &quot;Make it so.&quot; <br>
<br>
Perhaps she felt responsible to this Dylan Hunt somehow. They had after all made an arrangement that had benefits for both sides. Hunt proved himself honourable in his dealings with the Empire and it was obvious that the Empire had not responded in kind. <br>
<br>
She put her thoughts aside for the time being as the massive warship began to move from its orbit to join the battle already raging in Catrole. <br>
<br>
As the ship entered hyperspace, Meduk was all calm and business as she prepared her ship for battle. <br>
<br>

Harper had taken Luke halfway across the galaxy without saying too much too him. Well that wasn't true, Harper had said quite a lot since escaping the Imperials but Luke hadn't said much at all. He simply sat at a console asking few questions and responding to almost nothing. <br>
<br>
An alarm began to blare in the engine room and Harper dumped the ship out of slipstream. &quot;What's going on,&quot; Luke cried. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Exotic Matter core is leaking,&quot; Harper called out, &quot;The system is starting to overheat.&quot; <br>
<br>
Harper disentangled himself the pilots station and ran back to the engine room. Luke watched as Harper began to work various systems trying to vent the excess heat. Running around and jumping on and off ladders worked to stay ahead of the systems failures. When he was done Harper walked up to Luke who had a strange smile on his face. <br>
<br>
&quot;What's up with you?&quot; Harper asked with annoyance. <br>
<br>
&quot;You just reminded me of a good friend of mine, that's all,&quot; Luke replied. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've got about an hour of work to do before we can head out,&quot; Harper said, &quot;You any good with a hydrospanner?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I'm not bad.&quot; <br>
<br>

Dylan sat slumped behind his desk reviewing tactical scenarios and the latest intelligence from the front lines. In only a few short weeks the Empire had taken twenty star systems and was establishing itself as a major force in the Triangulum galaxy. <br>
<br>
Commonwealth forces had only engaged the Imperials directly a handful of times but each time they were soundly defeated by the Empire's impressive vessels. <br>
<br>
&quot;Captain Hunt,&quot; the holographic Andromeda appeared beside him, &quot;Can I get you anything?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No thank you Andromeda,&quot; he replied distractedly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan, you haven't eaten in three days. I'm bringing you some food and you will eat it, understood.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes ma'am,&quot; Dylan responded with a chuckle. <br>
<br>
Within seconds on of Andromeda's androids entered the room carrying a platter with a simple meal, a sandwich and some orange juice. <br>
<br>
Beka followed the android into the room carrying flexi and looking rather annoyed. <br>
<br>
&quot;We lost the Deliverance Task Force,&quot; she said without preamble, &quot;Dylan they're killing us. <br>
<br>
&quot;I know Beka,&quot; he replied, &quot;Our Intel reports that the Drago-Kazov and the Than are in a similar position. I've tried to contact both governments but they refuse to even consider working together.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We need to get more information on their movements,&quot; Beka decided. <br>
<br>
&quot;I agree,&quot; Dylan replied, &quot;The question is- how?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;They have established a major forward base on Kafreion, &quot;Rommie told them,&quot; we could try to infiltrate that facility.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dylan seemed to consider that for a moment but before he could speak Rommie interrupted his thoughts. <br>
<br>
&quot;A ship has just entered realspace on an unauthorized trajectory,&quot; she reported quickly as a smile began to cross her face, &quot;It's the Eureka Maru.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;My ship,&quot; Beka said with a start before turning and bolting for the hangar with Dylan close behind, his lunch forgotten and untouched on his desk. <br>
<br>
________________ <br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome to Sinti, Luke,&quot; Harper said, &quot;provisional capital of the Restored Commonwealth, but not exactly the best place to find a date, if you know what I mean.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Not really Harper,&quot; Luke responded as he peered through the forward view port. <br>
<br>
&quot;There seems to be a ship approaching,&quot; Luke noted. <br>
<br>
&quot;That's the Andromeda,&quot; Harper told him, &quot;The High Guard flagship and our final destination on this fantasy cruise.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Andromeda Ascendant,&quot; Harper called out into a open comm. channel, &quot;This is the Eureka Maru requesting permission to dock.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Permission granted Maru,&quot; Trance's voice replied, &quot;proceed.&quot; <br>
<br>
Within moments Harper had the Maru settled on the deck in Andromeda's hangar. He motioned to Luke to follow him and both men walked together across the deck. <br>
<br>
Waiting impatiently on the other side of the blast doors, Beka nearly burst through the door when it opened and tackled Harper before he could say a word. <br>
<br>
&quot;You better not have done anything to my ship,&quot; she said with mock anger, pulling Harper from the deck,&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We'll we rearranged the furniture a little but I think you'll like it, it has a very classic feel,&quot; he responded. <br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome back Harper,&quot; Dylan said extending his hand, a gesture Harper completely ignored instead going straight in for a hug. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan, this is Luke Skywalker,&quot; Harper said as he released him, &quot;He saved my but back on the Imperial ship, it was one of the most impressive things I've ever seen.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We are in your debt, Mr. Skywalker,&quot; Dylan told him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Commander Skywalker actually,&quot; Luke told them, &quot;Of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, we are a rebel group fighting the Empire within our own galaxy, but please call me Luke.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan,&quot; the captain said indicating that Luke should call him buy his first name, &quot;This is Beka Valentine, my first officer and the hologram you see in just one incarnation of this ships artificial intelligence, Andromeda.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Harper, show Luke to some quarters and get some rest,&quot; Dylan ordered, &quot;We will meet tomorrow for a full debriefing from both of you.&quot; <br>

Chapter Twelve <br>
<br>
Luke had been sitting there for over an hour, waiting for Harper to finish his debriefing with the High Guard Command. Inside the room Harper was telling them everything that had happened to him aboard the Running and Lusankya, the torture, the work he did, and the information he gave up. Harper had confided in Luke about the torture he had endured under Lord Krell's direction, about what he had told him and the pain he had felt. The one thing that seemed to worry him most was how Dylan might react when he found out that he had been broken. <br>
<br>
Beside Luke, Artoo-Detoo let out a little beep of concern for his master. The little droid was not entirely comfortable waiting here either. <br>
<br>
&quot;I just a little worried about Harper,&quot; Luke told the little droid, &quot;Leia was tortured by Darth Vader and she still has nightmares about it. Harper's a good guy, but nothing could have prepared him for the power of a Sith Lord.&quot; <br>
<br>
The door to the conference chamber cracked open, and a golden figure stepped out of the room visibly upset. <br>
<br>
This was Trance Gemini, Luke figured from the way Harper had described her. She walked over to Luke and sat down on the bench beside him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you OK?&quot; Luke asked cautiously. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I'm fine,&quot; she answer with a sniffle, &quot;You're Luke right?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes and you must be Trance,&quot; he responded extending his hand. <br>
<br>
Se took his hand lightly, but as she gripped a strange look crossed her face she bolted from her seat, letting go of Luke's hand. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have to go,&quot; she said distractedly, &quot;I have to go&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Commander,&quot; a voice called from inside the chamber, &quot;We are ready for you now.&quot; <br>
<br>
Luke entered the chamber and took a seat at a largish desk facing a panel of High Guard and Commonwealth officials. Dylan seemed to be at the head of the panel and he greeted the young Commander. <br>
<br>
&quot;Commander Skywalker, welcome,&quot; he said, &quot; Sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That is all right Captian Hunt,&quot; Luke responded, &quot;I sure you had much to discuss.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;As a member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, or Rebel Alliance, I am here on there behalf to offer my services in your fight against the Galactic Empire.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What can you tell us about this Empire, Commander&quot; a panel member asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;I can tell you that it replaced a benevolent, and ancient Republic that lasted over a thousand generations, that they massacre innocents and oppress virtually every non-human species that they rule. I can tell you that the Empire has tried to build weapons that can destroy entire planets in a single shot. I can tell you that given half a chance they will do the same here.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What can you tell us about this Lord Krell,&quot; Dylan asked this time. <br>
<br>
&quot;Krell is a Sith Lord,&quot; Luke responded, knowing this would be the hardest part of this presentation for these people to believe, they did not know the Force. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Sith are an ancient order dedicated to the Dark Side of the Force,&quot; he told them, &quot;The Force is an energy field that binds all life together, it allows him and other trained in its use to move objects of great size, read thoughts, deflect weapons fire and much more. Those who serve the Dark Side seek power and domination. The Emperor himself is rumoured to be a powerful Sith Lord and his Chief Lieutenant, Darth Vader, is also a Dark Lord.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You expect us to believe this nonsense,&quot; a Perseid panel member scoffed. <br>
<br>
Luke responded by closing his eyes and lifting the Perseid's stylus from of the desk in front of him. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am a Jedi apprentice, I also study the Force, in the service of the Light Side, &quot;Luke told them, &quot;My skills are not as great as those of the Dark Lord, but I assure the Force is quite real.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What useful information can you offer, Commander,&quot; Dylan asked, &quot;That we might consider aligning our forces with yours?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I can give the co-ordinates to the system where the Empire has located the conduit to my galaxy,&quot; Luke told them, &quot;That information in located in my droid.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That may indeed have some value, Commander,&quot; Dylan told him. <br>
<br>
The meeting went on for another three hours as Luke described the rise of the Empire and the calamities they had caused. He told them about the Ghorm Massacre and the destruction of Alderaan and the Death Star. The panel member continued to fire questions at Skywalker concerning specific actions that the Empire had taken. Luke answered as best he could but in time was sent away. <br>
<br>
On the bed with his legs dangling over the edge in the rather nice room they had provided for him, Luke was lying exhausted. <br>
<br>
&quot;That was almost more exhausting then my dual with Darth Vader back on Mimban,&quot; Luke told his little droid.&quot; <br>
<br>
Artoo responded with a supportive series of beeps and warbles. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your right, they'll do the right thing,&quot; Luke told the droid, &quot;Goodnight Artoo.&quot; <br>
<br>

Stay away from Sith Lords, her mother had warned her when she joined the Imperial service, they are nothing but trouble. Rather her mother would have warned her if she had known. <br>
<br>
Captain Meduk looked across a large metal table at Lord Krell. <br>
<br>
&quot;You have performed well Captian,&quot; Krell told her, &quot;Much better then expected. The Emperor himself is speaking of you in glowing terms.&quot; <br>
<br>
Despite herself she could not help but feel pride at those words. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, My Lord,&quot; she responded quietly. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is the current status of our armed forces,&quot; Krell asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have nearly a full sector fleet worth of ships available to us currently,&quot; Meduk responded, &quot;Forty Imperial Star Destroyers, Twenty-five Victory-Class Star Destroyers, and over One Hundred and Fifty support ships ranging from corvettes to strike-cruisers.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We have established a Imperial Intelligence Ubiquitorate Base on Kafreion with a full garrison and heavy defence systems. <br>
<br>
And we have engaged in thirty battles or skirmishes in the last month and have won all but two of them.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent Captian,&quot; Krell praised her, &quot;The Emperor will be most pleased.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;My Lord, we still understaffed for the task we have been given,&quot; Meduk continued, &quot;We need more ships to press the attack, but now new ships have arrived in nearly a week. We were supposed to have nearly double the ships we have right now by the end of next week. Please in your report to the Emperor, request that the ships promised do arrive.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Of course Captain,&quot; Krell replied, I'll see to it personally. <br>
<br>

Beyond the fringes of the known worlds a Dark presence moved. A familiar sensation tingled the mind of the Spirit of the Abyss. It was time, he had found what he was looking for over the centuries and millennia. Appearing before his thralls the Spirit used his will to drive them into action. Hundreds of swarmships departed from the world ship to join the thousands already waiting. These hundreds were no ordinary swarmships, they carried the weapons of Magog, Point-Singularity Projectors and tesseract phasing devices, no fleet could stand before them. <br>
<br>
History was in motion, he could not be late. <br>
<br>

<br>
The Drago-Kazov fleet was in ruins, as limped back from battle with the Imperial forces. The Empire was pressing their attack on nearly a dozen local Dragon systems, and winning. <br>
<br>
Fleet Marshal Cuatemoc, was standing quietly on his command deck, contemplating his future. This Imperial fleet was made up solely of Kludges, and yet their ships were far superior to anything the Drago-Kazov could through at them. <br>
<br>
&quot;Has there been any word from Enga's Redoubt yet?&quot; Cuatemoc asked quietly but with a fierce edge to it. <br>
<br>
&quot;No sir,&quot; the communications officer reported. <br>
<br>
The Fleet Marshal nodded, and hid his disgust. They Drago-Kazov Pride was hiding, if they gathered their forces together they could easily defend against the Imperial attacks. Perhaps they could even strike back. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, a slip courier is exiting slipstream,&quot; the sensor station reported, &quot;It has Commonwealth markings.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;They are transmitting a message,&quot; the comm. officer told him, &quot;For your eyes only.&quot; <br>
<br>
______________________ <br>
<br>
It had been almost a week since Harper returned with Luke to the Andromeda. Imperial Forces in that time had turned their considerable attention to the Drago-Kazov fleets nipping at their flank giving the High Guard some need breathing space. <br>
<br>
Dylan had invited Luke to remain aboard the Andromeda to work with him to find a way to drive the Empire from this galaxy. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have entered the Erihs system,&quot; Beka announced from the pilot station. Erihs was a system on the very edge of the Imperial expansion, and a likely target for their next attack. The system had only one small inhabited planet, Nottibboh, peopled entirely by a small cheery human-like species called the Tibbohs. <br>
<br>
The planet itself wasn't important but the system was located strategically in the war with the Imperials being set in a direct line with the Commonwealth world of Ekindu. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm detecting a hyperspace event on the edge of the system,&quot; Rommie reported, &quot;An Imperial Star Destroyer is approaching, ETA, twenty-five minutes.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Battle Station's,&quot; Dylan ordered, &quot;Is it just the one ship, Rommie?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; she responded, &quot;And Dylan, I think its the Starhammer.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Intercept course,&quot; Dylan ordered, &quot;Beka keep us at least one light minute away from the Starhammer at all times.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The Star Destroyer is approaching,&quot; Rommie warned, &quot;ETA now six minutes.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Prepare fighters for launch,&quot; Dylan ordered, &quot;Tyr, full spread kinetic missiles on my command at full force.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan you are aware that this is a bad idea,&quot; Beka said without sarcasm. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yep,&quot; he responded. <br>
<br>
&quot;So long as we're clear an that,&quot; she quipped. <br>
<br>
&quot;ETA, now two minutes,&quot; Rommie reported, &quot;Imperial fighters on approach.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Launch fighters,&quot; Dylan ordered, &quot;All right Tyr, Let's bring it.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;With pleasure,&quot; Tyr barked as he let lose hundreds of missiles at the opposing warship. Each missile sailed across the space between the Andromeda and the Imperial craft in a little more than one minute striking the shields of the powerful destroyer with nearly six and a half gigatons every second. Normally this amount of power would be easily absorbed by the Imperial shields but each missile imparted its power in a fraction of second causing damage at a rate the shields could not absorb. Nearly thirty seconds went by as Andromeda continued to pound the Star Destroyer from beyond the Destroyer's maximum range. All around the Andromeda the Imperial fighters were engaged in a deadly duel with the faster and more agile fighters of the Andromeda. <br>
<br>
&quot;Cease fire,&quot; Dylan ordered, &quot;Let's see what kind of damage we've done.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Their shield's are down,&quot; the holographic Andromeda reported, &quot;I am detecting radiation leaks from over a dozen locations, and the Imperial fighters are withdrawing.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Order our fighters into a escort pattern,&quot; Dylan ordered, &quot;Let's check it out.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I may be a trap,&quot; Tyr reminded him. <br>
<br>
&quot;It may be an opportunity,&quot; Dylan retorted. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan,&quot; Trance yelled, &quot;It's going to blow.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;They are launching escape pods,&quot; Rommie reported, &quot;And I'm reading a massive build up in the engine core. They seem to be scuttling the ship.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Star Destroyer exploded brilliantly in the night. Masses of thick, dense armour was vaporized instantly as the ship incinerated itself. <br>
<br>
&quot;Begin collecting the escape pods,&quot; Dylan instructed, &quot;No more then a handful at a time, Disarm any of the crew and lock them up.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan there are over twenty thousand people stationed aboard Star Destroyers,&quot; Beka exclaimed, &quot;We'll never be able to fit them all.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We will retrieve as many as we can,&quot; Dylan told her, &quot;I will not leave them behind.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan,&quot; Tyr's voice came in over the comm., &quot;I have someone here who demands to speak with you.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, who is it,&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Captian Meduk.&quot; <br>

Chapter Thirteen <br>
<br>
&quot;Captian Meduk,&quot; Dylan said cordially as he approached the cell door, &quot;Welcome back aboard the Andromeda Ascendant.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Your hospitality is somewhat lacking this time Captian Hunt,&quot; Meduk replied in a measured tone betraying no hint of her emotions. She stood near the back of the cell, her tunic unbuttoned revealing a simple undershirt beneath. She was flustered, that much was obvious, but there was something else in her stance, something that Dylan couldn't quite put his finger on. <br>
<br>
&quot;One must understand that circumstances are different now,&quot; Dylan responded. <br>
<br>
&quot;What have you done with my crew?&quot; she asked simply. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your senior staff is being held aboard the Andromeda for now,&quot; he told her, &quot;The rest of your crew is being held in a temporary facility on the planet surface.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I demand you release them into Imperial custody immediately,&quot; Meduk said. <br>
<br>
&quot;I can't do that,&quot; Dylan informed her, &quot;however, should the Empire move in on this system they will be here waiting.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;How many,&quot; she asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;9473,&quot; Dylan said quietly. <br>
<br>
&quot;From twenty thousand,&quot; she breathed, &quot;Captian, I'd like to consult with my officers, if I may.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, but not right now. First I'm going to bring you down to medical for a full exam. You can try to stop me but the guards are well trained, you wouldn't accomplish much.&quot; <br>

Vader was growing impatient. <br>
<br>
It had been nearly four weeks since he had received a report from the foolish Lord Krell and his expeditionary force. It had been three weeks since Vader had cut all supplies and reinforcements from this side of the universe. The Dark Lord of the Sith would not support a traitor. <br>
<br>
It that time Vader himself had sent several messages to his subordinate demanding information on his status and any data on the rebel pilot who slipped to the other side. He received only silence in response. <br>
<br>
Spy ships were sent to investigate the other side of the conduit and discovered that the Imperial fleet still survived on the other side. Again Vader demanded a report, and again silence. <br>
<br>
By the Emperor's order Krell had one more week to report in, failing that Vader was authorized to take command of the fleets on both sides of the Conduit and destroy Lord Krell. <br>
<br>

<br>
Another Imperial warship met a bitter end as Cuatemoc's fleet continued to blast away at their mighty task force. The Drago-Kazov outnumbered the Imperials three to one in this battle but the impressive quality of the Imperial ships made them difficult to destroy. <br>
<br>
Fortunately, Cuatemoc had discovered the Empire's fatal flaw and planned to exploit it. No two ships in Cuatemoc's fleet were any closer to each other then one light minute. In this way he was able to establish a killing field in which the Imperial's shorter ranged weapons would have little effect. <br>
<br>
Despite the problems of time lag for commands he wanted to give, Cuatemoc's fleet was slowly destroying the enemy. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sir,&quot; the communications officer reported, &quot;We've lost contact with the &quot;Purity.&quot; I believe she was destroyed.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Confirmed Sir,&quot; the sensor station added, &quot;The Purity is no more.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We've done enough damage here today,&quot; Cuatemoc began, &quot;Order all ships to the rendezvous point.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Sitting behind the large desk in personal Ready Room, Cuatemoc was viewing the tactical data that Captian Hunt had sent him. The strength of the Imperial warships was staggering, with weapons that were more powerful than entire Dragon warships. They were however not as invulnerable as the data made them seem. <br>
<br>
The Leviathan Roused type Nietzschean cruiser, was not as powerful as the mighty Commonwealth's old Glorious Heritage-Class Heavy Cruisers, such as the Andromeda. They did however pack quite a punch as the Empire discovered today losing five of their warships out of a ten ship fleet. <br>
<br>
His battle plan worked, and now he was about to do something that he never thought he would never have felt obligated to do. <br>
<br>
&quot;Prepare a slip courier,&quot; he ordered into the comm. as he transferred his tactical data to data chit, &quot;Send to the Andromeda Ascendant, top priority, top secret, for Dylan Hunts eyes only.&quot; <br>
<br>

&quot;Are you sure your up to this Beka,&quot; Dylan asked, &quot;This would be a tough mission for anyone.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm ready Dylan,&quot; she responded emphatically, &quot;Besides, has the Maru ever gone on a suicide mission and not come back.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What about me,&quot; Harper called out, &quot;I'm not ready. In fact I'm nowhere near ready. I have no desire to put myself any were near &quot;Mister Tall, Dark, and Deadly again.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry Harper,&quot; Beka reassured, &quot;Its just a quick hop in, get some data and back out again.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That is what I'm worried about,&quot; Harper moaned. <br>
<br>
A few hours later Beka, Harper, Trance and Luke with Artoo Detoo, boarded the Maru and left for Kafreion. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think she likes me,&quot; Luke told Harper as they sat back in the engine room. <br>
<br>
&quot;Beka? Don't worry about her she doesn't like anyone for the first couple of days,&quot; Harper told him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Not Beka, Trance,&quot; Luke corrected, &quot;Ever since we first met at the debriefing, she avoided me at every turn. I've tried to speak with her three times since we've been underway, each time she gives me the cold shoulder.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That's not like Trance,&quot; Harper mused, &quot;She's usually very friendly to everyone, so long as they aren't trying to kill her.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I haven't made any attempts yet,&quot; Luke told him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe you will,&quot; Harper suggested, &quot;Trance is kind of spooky. She can see the future sometimes. In fact she is from the future.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What,&quot; Luke exclaimed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Never mind,&quot; Harper told him, &quot;its a long story...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Harper, Luke, get up here,&quot; Beka ordered. <br>
<br>
Both men rushed to the cockpit taking their stations without any questions. <br>
<br>
&quot;Imperial patrol,&quot; Trance filled them in, &quot;They're nearly on top of us.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I count five Imperial TIE fighters,&quot; Luke told them, &quot;They're short range fighters, they'd never of gotten out here on their own. There is probably a control ship somewhere nearby.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;How long until slipstream,&quot; Harper asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;I need two minutes,&quot; Beka told them. <br>
<br>
The Maru lurched as Beka threw full power to the engines in an attempt to steam roll past the TIE fighters without a fight. But the whoever was commanding those fighters saw what she was trying to do and did his best to prevent it. <br>
<br>
&quot;They're firing,&quot; Trance yelled. <br>
<br>
The Maru began to roll as she evaded the oncoming green bolts of death. Harper, who was controlling the tactical systems, let two missiles fly and they struck the lead Imperial fighter blasting through that craft and nicking another fighter behind. <br>
<br>
&quot;Beka,&quot; Luke called out, &quot;I've got the control ship on the screen now. It's a Carrak-Class cruiser and its trying to block the slipstream point.&quot;<br>
&quot;Will just have to get their first,&quot; Beka told him as she poured still more power into the engines. <br>
<br>
The cruiser now began to open fire as the Maru approached, but she was moving to quickly and erratically now for anything but a luck shoot to get through. <br>
<br>
&quot;Prepare for slipstream,&quot; Beka called. <br>
<br>
The Maru passed only meters in front of the Imperial ship as Beka activated the slipstream drive. Space unfolded before both ships, swallowing up the Maru, but the Carrak turned away from the slipstream portal taking damage as the tendrils of energy tried to pull the larger ship in as well. <br>
<br>
&quot;We're safe,&quot; Trance reported. <br>
<br>
&quot;For now,&quot; Harper reminded her. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome to Kafreion,&quot; Beka announced, &quot;What do we do now?&quot;<br>
&quot;The Imperial Picket line won't be guarding the entire planet,&quot; Luke told her, &quot;If you set the ship down just of to the edge of the detection net, they probably won't know you were there.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;If you try to set down to far away, Imperial Intelligence will immediately know that we are here and we won't get ten steps before we're caught.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The edge of the net it is then,&quot; Beka said as she turned back to flying her ship. <br>
<br>
It was a matter of only a few minutes for Beka to set the ship down. They were sixty kilometres from the capital city on the edge of a dense forest far from prying eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;We'll need a transport,&quot; Luke said <br>
<br>
&quot;There was a village about a mile south of here,&quot; Trance said helpfully, &quot;We could probably find one there.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Then we've got some walking to do,&quot; Beka announced, &quot;Trance, Luke, stay with the ship. Harper, your with me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;If we're not back in six hours, come looking for us. Otherwise stay here.&quot; <br>
<br>
Trance did not look particularly pleased with this arrangement but she kept her mouth shut and starred intently at her monitor. <br>
<br>
&quot;All right Harper, let's go.&quot; <br>
<br>
Left alone aboard the Maru, Luke and Trance found it relatively easy to avoid each other in the confined space available. Luke worked to familiarize himself with the piloting controls while Trance maintained a constant watch on the sensor screens. In was four hours before they spoke to each other. <br>
<br>
&quot;You don't like me for some reason,&quot; Luke said, &quot;Why?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I know what you are,&quot; Trance told him. <br>
<br>
Luke tried to get some feeling from her in the Force but he was unable to, either his powers were not developed enough or she was somehow blocking him. <br>
<br>
&quot;What am I,&quot; he asked with real curiosity. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are a son of the Abyss, a servant of evil. You train yourself to control the energy of the universe for your own dark purposes. I see you Skywalker, commanding armies of Darkness. Though you do not realize it now, you have a dark path ahead of you.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It's not like that,&quot; Luke stammered, &quot;The Force isn't about control, that's the Dark Side. I don't want any part of that.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe so,&quot; Trance said starring deeply into his eyes, &quot;But it may well be your destiny.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
About an hour latter Beka and Harper returned with a rickety looking anti-grave sled. They said they had bought it of an old Kaf couple for twice its value. <br>
<br>
&quot;It will get us to the Capital,&quot; Beka told them, &quot;If I can ever get used to these Kaf style controls.&quot; <br>
<br>
The controls she referred to were two simple knobs for directional control and a squeeze handle for acceleration. These were perfect for the hundreds of fibre like &quot;arms&quot; and the tentacles of the Kaf people but awkward for humans and most other species. <br>
<br>
&quot;And then into a heavily guarded Imperial Intelligence base using only our own wits and this little astromech droid,&quot; Harper sounded somewhat discouraged. <br>
<br>
&quot;We better get going,&quot; Trance told them, &quot;We kind of stand out from the locals out here.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The city won't be so bad,&quot; Beka replied, &quot;But we can't take too many chances. Where going to need to disguise ourselves.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I have an idea,&quot; Luke said as they left the Maru. He explained it to them on the way. <br>

Caffeine isn't bad for you.  How could someone say that a necessity of life is bad for you.  The horror! j/k  Actually if there are any real caffeine addicts *ahem*, I mean fans, out there, there's this new stuff called Bawls (yah I know it sounds weird) and it comes in this blue glass bottle that's really cool.  And guess what...it has an actual warning on it.  It says something like: Warning: This product contains high levels of caffeine.  Me and friends think it's awesome.

Chapter Fourteen <br>
<br>
&quot;This isn't going to work,&quot; Harper announced as he struggled into the Imperial uniform they had just stolen. The boot he was trying to get on just wouldn't fit and he found himself hopping all around the back alley they were using for cover. <br>
<br>
&quot;Trust me,&quot; was Luke's simple reply, &quot;I've done this sort of thing before.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;How did it work out,&quot; Beka asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;Not bad,&quot; Luke answered sheepishly. <br>
<br>
Luke and Trance had elected to wear Stormtrooper armour while Beka and Harper had grabbed officer uniforms. Harper looked out of place in his borrowed Imperial Navy Lieutenants uniform but Beka wore her Imperial Intelligence uniform well. <br>
<br>
There was nothing they could do to disguise Artoo, but droids were common enough on Imperial bases that he should go unnoticed. <br>
<br>
&quot;All right everyone, let's do this,&quot; Beka ordered. <br>
<br>
The group slowly emerged from the alley with Beka and Harper leading the group and Trance and Luke following close behind. Artoo formed the rear as he struggled to keep up on the battle damaged roadways of the Kafreion capital. <br>
<br>
They approached the base from the south side entrance and walked in through the outer fortifications without a challenge. Stormtroopers were everywhere, guarding every door and corridor as the group wandered through them. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is a little easy, don't you think,&quot; Beka whispered to Harper as they turned a corner. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, that's a bit understated boss,&quot; Harper whispered back. <br>
<br>
&quot;We're here,&quot; Luke announced through the small transceiver placed in Beka's ear. <br>
<br>
It was a small adjunct operations centre not far from the main Operations and Command Centre down the hall. <br>
<br>
Beka turned away from the Stormtrooper guarding the door, pulling a datapad from her pocket and handing it Harper, she whispered to Luke. <br>
<br>
&quot;What now?&quot;<br>
&quot;Go in,&quot; Luke whispered back. <br>
<br>
Beka began to walk for the door once more but was challenged by on of the guards. <br>
<br>
&quot;Identification,&quot; he rumbled. <br>
<br>
&quot;You don't need to see her identification,&quot; Luke responded strangely before Beka could reply. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I do,&quot; the Guard insisted. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, you do not,&quot; Luke told him putting more force into his words. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, I do not,&quot; the guard returned with a distant sounding voice and both guards stood aside as the group entered the chamber. <br>
<br>
Luke locked the door as they entered and Artoo rolled up to the nearest console and jacked into the system. <br>
<br>
&quot;Artoo should be able to interpret the entire Imperial network,&quot; Luke told them. <br>
<br>
&quot;He better,&quot; Beka replied or this whole party has been for nothing. <br>
<br>
Luke smiled as she said that and turned away. <br>
<br>
&quot;What,&quot; Beka demanded. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing,&quot; he told her, &quot;You just remind so much of one of my friends, he's a lot like you.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Great,&quot; Beka respond without enthusiasm. <br>
<br>
&quot;Artoo,&quot; Luke said turning back to the task, &quot;We need tactical data and general information about the Imperial fleet in this galaxy. Try to stay away from heavily encrypted files we don't want to alert anyone that we're here.&quot; <br>
<br>
The small droid beeped his understanding and got to work. <br>
<br>
&quot;Handy little thing to have around isn't he,&quot; Beka commented, &quot;But not very talkative.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You haven't seen him with Threepio,&quot; Luke said with a smile, &quot;Those two never shut up.&quot; <br>
<br>
Artoo let out a loud electronic raspberry in response but continued with his work. <br>
<br>
&quot;That, I understood,&quot; Harper chimed. <br>
<br>
A moment later Artoo had something. <br>
<br>
&quot;They haven't brought in any new ships in a couple weeks,&quot; Luke read to them, &quot;Not since before I arrived. They are behind schedule for the arrival of over a hundred ships of all classes.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What's the hold up,&quot; Trance asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;They don't know,&quot; Luke told them, &quot;They seem to have been ordered not to contact the Imperial command except through Lord Krell himself.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, and Artoo has also confirmed the location of the Conduit between our galaxies and he has hacked into the tactical database. The Empire's next target is Ekindu.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Ekindu,&quot; Beka breathed, &quot;We have to get back to the Maru.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Luke said as he turned and gazed at the sensor station. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is it,&quot; Harper demanded. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Lusankya has just entered orbit, she has a fleet of four Star Destroyers with her.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We leave right now,&quot; Beka ordered. This was going to be bad. <br>
<br>
<br>
Krell was a man obsessed, not with the conquest of this galaxy, for that would come in time, but rather with the fourth DNA marker of the Magog. The first three markers were originally from the Empire's own galaxy, but the fourth marker did not conform with any know species in the galaxy. It must therefore be native to another galaxy. <br>
<br>
&quot;My Lord,&quot; the Lusankya's Captian approached the Dark Lord slowly, &quot;We have received word that the Starhammer was scuttled and her crew captured. They are being held on the planet Erihs and are awaiting rescue.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Send the escort ships to rescue Captian Meduk and her crew,&quot; Krell ordered, &quot;We have little need of them aboard this ship.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; the Captian replied and he hurriedly went off to relay the order. <br>
<br>
As the Captian walked away Krell felt a massive rush hit him like a turbolaser blast. He shot up from his seat stalk straight and began to focus on the feeling. <br>
<br>
It was the Force, strong and alive as he had ever felt it. He focused his feelings trying to locate this rush of power. It was difficult to focus, the energy was so overwhelming, but finally he was able to find the source. <br>
<br>
It was coming from the planet, that was certain, but now that he had narrowed in on it, Krell could sense that it was not one locus of the force but rather two, interacting with each other in violent way. <br>
<br>
&quot;Captian,&quot; Krell burst out into the come systems, &quot;Have my shuttle prepped for launch and a full squadron of TIE interceptors readied for me. I am going to the planet.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
They had made it all the way to the outer courtyard before being challenged by another Imperial guard. This one however was not so easy to manipulate. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I do need to see your identification,&quot; the guard insisted for a third time as Luke tried to use the Force on him without success. The guard lifted his blaster rifle to emphasis his point. A small squad of Stormtroopers came over to see what was going on. <br>
<br>
Beka reached into her uniform and pulled out the ID card that she found there. <br>
<br>
&quot;Her you go,&quot; she said with a note of annoyance in her voice as she handed him the stolen ID. <br>
<br>
The guard scanned the ID and looked back up at Beka. <br>
<br>
&quot;This isn't you,&quot; he said with satisfaction. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your right,&quot; Beka said pulling out her own blaster and dropping the Stormtrooper to the floor. <br>
<br>
Luke was sudden blur of movement, knowing he had to act fast to protect his new friends. <br>
<br>
He whipped of the restrictive Stormtrooper helmet and grabbed his lightsabre from a waiting Artoo. His Jedi skills were not yet advanced enough to block the shots of half a dozen trained Stormtroopers, but in their current close quarters he was able to cut them down with ease. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have to get to the gate,&quot; Luke cried as he joined the others behind cover. <br>
<br>
&quot;No kidding,&quot; Beka replied without humour. <br>
<br>
They were only about ten metres from the gate, but as it was they would never reach it. The courtyard was covered by anti-personal cannons and guards were taking up defensive potations around the perimeter. <br>
<br>
Beka and Trance had abandoned their 'borrowed' blasters in favour of force lances and were trying to pick of the soldiers manning the cannons while Harper concentrated on the perimeter guards. <br>
<br>
&quot;Artoo,&quot; Luke called, &quot;We need some cover,&quot; <br>
<br>
Artoo whistled his understanding and moved out into the courtyard. The Imperials carrying nothing for the little droid continued to fire on the infiltrators. When he arrived at what he felt was the best location Artoo began venting smoke into the courtyard obscuring everything. <br>
<br>
&quot;Go now,&quot; Luke demanded and the group scrambled to get to the gate. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's locked,&quot; Harper told them as he ran into the closed doors. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Luke told them brandishing his lightsabre, &quot;I have a lock pick.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well you better hurry,&quot; Trance remarked, &quot;Its not going to take them long to figure out where we are.&quot; <br>
<br>
Luke plunged his lightsabre into the thick gate doors and began to slice through them. The durasteel gave way slowly but soon there was a small gap in the door large enough for the entire group to escape. <br>
<br>
Luke made Trance go out first followed by Harper. Beka went next dropping her force lance on the other side, but Luke remained behind. He couldn't leave without Artoo. <br>
<br>
&quot;Artoo,&quot; Luke called out, &quot;The speeder leaving, we've got to go.&quot; <br>
<br>
Artoo came screaming toward the exit Luke had cut, his sensors allowing him to see through the thick fog he had made. <br>
<br>
Once out Luke and Artoo moved as fast as they could in the direction they had seen Beka and the others run in. In the near distance he could see Beka waving them on trying to get them to hurry. Luke could see that Beka was screaming into her comlink. <br>
<br>
Only seconds later the gate exploded behind him. Beka's force lance had been reconfigured as a plasma grenade. <br>
<br>
That gate was now closed. <br>
<br>
<br>
They made it back to the anti-grav sled in the burned out back alley without any real problems. They abandoned their Imperial garb for their more comfortable clothes and settled in to wait. <br>
<br>
The entire city was alerted to their presence, and right now Imperial troops were searching for them. Much of the city fringe had been burned and destroyed during the Imperial invasion, even if the entire garrison came out looking for them it would take days to search the entire area. <br>
<br>
&quot;We make for the Maru tomorrow,&quot; Beka told them, &quot;From there we'll take our chances with whatever space defences the Imps have.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I think we should leave right now Beka,&quot; Trance said, she seemed to be growing increasingly agitated, &quot;There is something coming; something very bad.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I sense it too,&quot; Luke admitted, &quot;It reeks of the Dark Side. Lord Krell is coming for us, I'm sure of it.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Okay then, lets pack are crap and get the hell out of dodge,&quot; Harper said as he jumped up from his place on the ground, trying his best not to look terrified, he was still nursing a mild burn to his leg, a near miss from a blaster shot. <br>
<br>
&quot;Fine, we'll go now,&quot; Beka said not sure what to make of the two creepy warnings she was given. <br>
<br>
<br>
Lord Krell piloted his own shuttle as he descended toward the planet. He focused on the strange sense he had in the Force and redirected his shuttle toward it. It was moving south now, away from the city toward a cluster of small villages near a small lake. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have you now,&quot; Krell announced to himself as he changed his course. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper, power up the engines,&quot; Beka ordered as they rushed aboard the Maru, &quot;We're getting out of here and we're doing it now.&quot; <br>
<br>
Trance took position at the sensor station bring the active and passive systems online as she scanned the area. <br>
<br>
&quot;Beka,&quot; she reported, &quot;We've got trouble. TIE fighters incoming from orbit, they're heading this way.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;OK then,&quot; Beka replied wearily, &quot;We're out here, everybody hold on to something.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Maru rocked as it lifted off from the planets surface. The Imperial craft continued to approach as Beka angle her ship away from them and rocketed off at the best possible speed in atmosphere. <br>
<br>
&quot;They're catching up,&quot; Trance told Beka. <br>
<br>
&quot;I can see that,&quot; she responded with annoyance. <br>
<br>
Green bolts sailed past the Maru as the Imperial fighters began to fire on the Maru, trying to force her from the sky. Beka for here part was doing quite a job of preventing that from happening. <br>
<br>
&quot;An Imperial shuttle is approaching,&quot; Trance warned, &quot;Whoever is piloting that thing is either a fantastic pilot, or absolutely insane.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Possibly both,&quot; Luke told them, &quot;I think that Lord Krell is on that shuttle.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What,&quot; Trance exclaimed, &quot;How can you tell?&quot;<br>
&quot;I can 'feel' him,&quot; he told her. <br>
<br>
The Maru shook with a grazing hit from one of the Imperial fighters. Luke manned the weapons station returned fire with the point defence lasers but with little effect. <br>
<br>
&quot;We're almost clear of the atmosphere,&quot; Beka announced. <br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe, but that Super Star Destroyer is still going to be in the way,&quot; Trance told her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Damn,&quot; Beka said as she dropped her ship into a lower orbit trying to get out from under the dagger shaped behemoth. <br>
<br>
The Imperial shuttle was now right on the Maru's tail and still gaining ground. <br>
<br>
Beka threw the ship into a sudden straight drive for space, leaving the Imperial fighters behind but not the shuttle. Bursting into space Beka pumped full power into the engines before the gunners on the Lusankya had a chance to fire leaving both the battleship and the shuttle far behind. <br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone prepare for slipstream,&quot; Beka ordered and the Maru opened the dimensional rift and the Maru was gone. <br>
<br>
<br>
Watching the Commonwealth vessel escape with his strange Force locus was very upsetting for Lord Krell. In his anger he demolished much of the shuttles interior throwing waves of Force into control systems and tearing apart flight components. <br>
<br>
He did so much damage in his rage that the Lusankya had to rescue him from disaster as his shuttle began to plunge back into the atmosphere. <br>
<br>
Back in the safety of his command ship he realized that it would not matter. Once he had found the final piece of his genetic puzzle nothing would ever stand against him again. <br>

excerpt - Commencement Address to <br>
the High Guard Academy <br>
CY 10089 <br>
<br>
Chapter Fifteen <br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome, Captian,&quot; Dylan said as Captian Meduk entered the room. Dylan was standing in front of a large monitor that was displaying the tactical situation the Commonwealth was facing. On it nearly two dozen worlds were represented in a dark red, worlds that had fallen to the Empire. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Meduk replied as Dylan directed her to a seat at a small conference table. <br>
<br>
Dylan sat down across from her leaning back he crossed his arms and waited for here to speak. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why have you brought me here,&quot; she asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;That's a more loaded question then you might think,&quot; Dylan told her as he leaned forward, &quot;Your Empire has, for the most part, been winning this war. The momentum is about to change Captian, and your going to be part of that.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What makes you think I would betray the Empire, my own people,&quot; she demanded coldly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Because I know you Tealera,&quot; Dylan said, &quot;I the very least I know your type. Your honourable, for the most part, and you don't like going back on your word. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your also angry, angry at an Empire that forced you to do things you are not proud of, just to get the very things you had already earned.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Idealistic bastard,&quot; Meduk shot back as she bolted from her seat, &quot;The Empire is my home, my life. I will not betray it. I can not.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It has already betrayed you Tealera,&quot; Dylan said quietly, &quot;You wanted to complete the deal didn't you. I heard it in your voice when we brought you the slipstream technology. They compromised you, and you like a dutiful officer let it happen.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Would you have done anything different,&quot; she returned with bitterness. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Dylan replied honestly, &quot;But if I would of hated myself if I hadn't done something different.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tears began to form in the corners of Meduk's eyes as she consider the consequences of her actions. She would never be able to return home again, never see her family or visit the Greenway on her homeworld. <br>
<br>
&quot;You do have an option Tealera,&quot; Dylan said quietly, &quot;In return for your help we will give you one of the escape shuttles your crew used. We have a pilot from the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker, with us. If you would like, once this is over, he'll take you home.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Luke Skywalker,&quot; Tealera breathed, &quot;He destroyed the Death Star right out from Darth Vader's nose. <br>
<br>
&quot;I accept, Dylan,&quot; she said, &quot;When do we begin?&quot; <br>
<br>

<br>
Brother Behemial Far Traveller walked the paths of the planet Kingfisher with a certain trepidation. He had been spawned on this world, he had been show the Way on this world. There was a small Wayist commune not far off where Magog converts were welcomed. <br>
<br>
The local population was not pleased by this, they still feared the Magog and with good reason. For the last forty years the Magog had come periodically to this world killing and raping and feeding as they pleased. <br>
<br>
It was in one of those raids that Red Plague had been born. <br>
<br>
He still did not like to think of himself as being Red Plague, he had cast that all aside to become Rev Bem, a being dedicated to peace. <br>
<br>
A child ran out in front of him nearly tripping over Rev Bem's all covering Wayist robes. A new Magog assault had started in the last few days, the largest in over a decade. The child was being chased by two of those Magog. <br>
<br>
&quot;Stand behind me,&quot; Rev growled to the child, &quot;I will let no harm come to you.&quot; <br>
<br>
The two Magog approached screeching out a warning as they detected the sent of one of their own kind. <br>
<br>
&quot;You will not harm this child,&quot; Rev told them simply, &quot;Go now, and find easier prey.&quot; <br>
<br>
The two Magog were not so eager to let their prize escape them and the continued to approach. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have warned you,&quot; Rev told them, &quot;The consequences will be on your own heads.&quot; <br>
<br>
This did not seem to bother these Magog at all as they launched their attack. Forced into no other option Rev struck back with a ferocity he had not felt since the Magog attacked the Andromeda. <br>
<br>
These two Magog stood no chance against him, Rev knew how to defend himself and how to fight in a worthy cause. The child he had protected looked in awe at what he had just seen. <br>
<br>
&quot;Go now to the commune,&quot; Rev demanded, &quot;You will be safe there.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I want to stay with you,&quot; the child cried. <br>
<br>
Rev pulled back his hood to show the child his gruesome face, the child looked back in horror to see that his saviour was in fact the same species as his enemy. <br>
<br>
&quot;Go now,&quot; Rev growled, &quot;You will be safe with my brothers.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Rev Bem discarded his Wayist robes as he approached one of the landing fields that the agile Magog Swarmships had used. Underneath was the armoured tunic he had stolen aboard the world ship nearly two years prior. It identified him as someone of a higher position in the loose Magog hierarchy. <br>
<br>
He was Red Plague once again. <br>
<br>
As he passed through the encampment that had grown near the landing sites he began to here whispers. They spoke of the Abyss, the fleet he had assembled, and a coming battle that could be the key to everything. <br>
<br>
A sudden realization dawned on Rev as he walked through the camp, none of the Magog that had been descended from the first invasions had known of the Spirit of the Abyss. The god of the Magog was all but entirely forgotten among his people, except for those aboard the Worldship. <br>
<br>
The fleet was from the Worldship, possibly the vanguard of the new and final Magog invasion. Dylan needed to know about this. <br>
<br>
Many of the Magog were talking of the invasion fleet from a distant galaxy. A people who called themselves the Empire. They were to be the first targets of Magog wrath. <br>
<br>
<br>
Rev hurried himself over to the parked Swarmships weaving his way through the carnage and death he had hoped to never see again. The Magog had little concern for guarding their ships, there simply weren't a lot of people foolish enough to try to steal them and so Rev found it easy to board one of the small but powerful ships. <br>
<br>
It was therefore, something of a surprise to find a already in the pilot seat. <br>
<br>
&quot;Great One,&quot; the creature growled, &quot;What you doing here?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I will go where I please,&quot; Rev bit back, &quot;Now step away from the controls.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I not moving,&quot; it responded. <br>
<br>
With no other choice Rev lashed out at the creature knocking it unconscious. He cast it out the airlock and took up the pilots station. <br>
<br>
It was only a matter of moments before he could bring the craft into the air. Other swarmships in the area seemed to be trying to launch in pursuit of Rev, but they would not catch him. However, the thousands of Magog ships in orbit might have a better chance. <br>
<br>
The sensor returns that Rev was now seeing showed the largest fleet of swarmships the galaxy had known since the invasion of Brandeburg Tor over three hundred years ago. That attack had devested the planet and killed nearly all of its three billion inhabitants. <br>
<br>
Veering away from the massive swarm, Rev decided he must go straight to Dylan despite the danger, and warn him of the impending doom. <br>
<br>
_________________________ <br>

<br>
The time had come. <br>
<br>
Dylan Hunt stood at the Captain's station on the Command Deck of the Andromeda Ascendant waiting for battle. The ship was ready, fully stocked with missiles, the antiproton tanks were filled to the brim and every slipfighter had just been reconditioned. <br>
<br>
Similar preparations had taken place on the nearly three hundred Commonwealth ships that were there with him at the staging area on the eve of battle. <br>
<br>
Dylan opened a communication channel to his fleet. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is Captain Dylan Hunt,&quot; he began, &quot;Today is the day we have been waiting for, the day we have trained for, the day we have prepared for. In a few moments time we, the combined forces of the Restored Systems Commonwealth, will go forward into battle for the first time as a unified force. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have fought together before to be sure, but we always fought for our own goals, now we fight for the security of the Commonwealth and for the goal of bringing lasting peace to the galaxy. <br>
<br>
&quot;This battle may not be easy but I have been told, long ago, that nothing worth doing is easy.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Today sentient beings of the Commonwealth, we turn this war around. Today is the first step toward restoring peace to the galaxy.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dylan paused in his speech for a moment, gathering strength. <br>
<br>
&quot;All craft, prepare for slipstream,&quot; he ordered, &quot;Jump.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Three hundred Commonwealth ships leaped into the Cheops system, the system the Empire called &quot;Beachhead&quot; and spread out across space. <br>
<br>
The Empire had seeded the system with thousands of mines since the last battle took place here but they did not stand in the way as High Guard group defence frigates began sweeping the mines from in front of the massive fleet. <br>
<br>
Defending the Imperial installation were thirty warships, a significant fraction of the Imperial fleet in this galaxy and they were prepared for a fight. Many of the ships were the large Imperial Star Destroyers and carried enough firepower, in Meduk's words, to slag an entire world. <br>
<br>
&quot;Imperial Forces,&quot; Dylan transmitted to the enemy fleet, &quot;Surrender immediately and you will be allowed to return to your home galaxy in peace. Fail to surrender and you may not survive.&quot; <br>
<br>
A moment passed and no response came from the Imperials. <br>
<br>
&quot;It seems you have your answer, Captian Hunt,&quot; Tyr remarked from the fire control station. <br>
<br>
&quot;All craft, engage,&quot; Dylan ordered. <br>
<br>
The Imperials were not about to give up without a fight, the Star Destroyers and orbital stations launched their complements of TIE fighters and were joined by fighters stationed on the planet. Assault ships and missile boats added to the Empire's military strength. <br>
<br>
The Imperial missile boats, shuttle sized heavy fighters capable of hyperspace jumps, began to make predetermined hops through hyperspace to engage the Commonwealth forces. Slower than even the TIE fighters when compared to Slipfighters the missile boats carried heavy shields and began to attack the gathered Commonwealth ships. <br>
<br>
A Sabra-Jaguar battleship suffered the brunt of the first assault as dozens in Imperial concussion missiles fired at close range peppered its hull. The ship's fighter escorts quickly swept away the missile boats but not before doing serious damage to the drive system and hull. <br>
<br>
Across the fleet the Imperial's first strike had meet with little success. Point-defence lasers were able to cut down most of the slow moving missiles before they were a threat to most ships and much of the damage that did occur was largely surface damage. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tyr, target the nearest Star Destroyer and open fire,&quot; Dylan ordered, &quot;Beka keep us just out of the main battle line, I want to be able to see everything.&quot; <br>
<br>
He received acknowledgements from both parties and began to focus on the larger battle. <br>
<br>
The Imperials were holding back, that much was obvious. They didn't want to risk themselves engaging a numerically far superior force. However the Imperial commander was he was smart enough to know that his ships could not stand a sustained attack from a ship like the Andromeda and so he was working to keep them away. <br>
<br>
&quot;These mines are a problem,&quot; Beka announced, &quot;The frigates are clearing them away as fast as they can but the Imperials just keep dumping more of the them.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That can't last forever,&quot; Dylan told her, &quot;But it will slow us down. Trance where are those mines launching from?&quot;<br>
&quot;They seem to be coming from the main space station,&quot; Trance reported, &quot;They are launching about two hundred mines a second, fist sized thermonuclear devices it seems.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Rommie, have the Wrath of Achilles tack out that base,&quot; Dylan ordered. <br>
<br>
The Wrath acknowledged the order and moved into a better strike position. It began to fire at its maximum rate at the large station. Fourteen hundred missiles struck the station every second for thirty seconds before the shields began to buckle. It took ten more seconds to finish the station off. <br>
<br>
Without the minefield to protect them any more the Imperial ships were forced to engage the Commonwealth head to head. With the fleet so spread out over the system the Imperials had to pick their battles carefully. The began to engage a force of Castalian destroyers defending a Commonwealth cruiser. The Castalians managed to disable one of the powerful warships before most of the rest broke through the line. <br>
<br>
Now it became a real fight as Commonwealth forces began to swoop down on the Imperial vessels. Ships that strayed too close to the Imperial suffered greatly as their powerful turbolasers often incinerated the offending craft. <br>
<br>
The Imperial forces knew they had lost and were trying to get clear to jump into hyperspace, most of their ships did not make the jump. <br>
<br>
____________________ <br>
<br>
<br>
Within days the reports began to come in to Dylan's office, the Imperials had begun to withdraw from over a dozen worlds. The destruction of the base in the Cheops system had change the momentum in the war. The Empire still maintained its base on Kafreion and in other systems but worlds they had not invested in with a great deal of resources were quickly abandoned. <br>
<br>
&quot;They'll move to reinforce the Conduit system,&quot; Tealera told him, still wearing her Imperial uniform. <br>
<br>
&quot;I figured as much,&quot; Dylan told her, &quot;I know this is difficult for you. But you are doing the right thing.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;He is right you know,&quot; Luke said as he reviewed the tactical data from the battle, &quot;The Empire has no business in this galaxy.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What would a Rebel know of it,&quot; Meduk snapped. <br>
<br>
&quot;Enough,&quot; Luke told her, &quot;More then enough.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Bickering isn't going to help,&quot; Dylan interjected before Meduk could respond, &quot;If you to want to go home before the end your going to need to work together, because one thing is for sure, I'm going to destroy your conduit once and for all.&quot; <br>

Chapter Sixteen <br>
<br>
Bits of furniture and computer systems lay strewn about the private quarters of Lord Krell. In the middle of the frenzied chaos stood the Dark Lord who was looking for something else to break. Seeing a chair that had somehow escaped his notice, Krell used the Force to pick up the chair and rip it to pieces. <br>
<br>
Not only did he have to abandon most of the systems the Empire had conquered in this galaxy but he also had to abandon his search for the final genetic marker, the last species that formed the very source of these Magog creatures. <br>
<br>
Worse yet, if this system fell, he would have to return to the Empire's home galaxy and face Darth Vader. Only two beings in the all the universe could make a chill go up Krell's back, the Emperor and Darth Vader. Vader had been sending ultimatums for some time now demanding a report, but he was reluctant to travel to this galaxy himself. That however would change if Krell could not hold back the native forces himself. <br>
<br>
But he would not ask Darth Vader for help. <br>
<br>
The Lusankya still functioned and the Commonwealth engineers were still hard at work, though reluctantly, on the slipstream modifications to the Corellian Corvette Running. Krell also still had nearly two hundred Imperial Warships at his disposal. Star Destroyers and Dreadnoughts, Strike Cruisers and Frigates. He even managed to relocate two of the new Golan III defence stations from their respective worlds. <br>
<br>
A light flashed on one of the few still functional monitors in his chamber. With a causal flick of the Force he activated the screen and saw that the tactical situation report he had asked for was here. <br>
<br>
He smiled, the defences of this system were adequate and there were enough ships to launch crippling raids on the nearest worlds. The Empire would not leave this galaxy without a fight. <br>
<br>
And he would find the secret of these Magog. <br>
<br>

Charlemagne Bolivar and Jack Fremont were nearly at each others throats, the former could have slit that throat without much effort, and would have under different circumstances, but Charlemagne Bolivar was far to gentile to do that sort of thing himself, at least not in full view of Dylan Hunt. <br>
<br>
&quot;Pride Sabra-Jaguar will not allow its forces to fall into an obvious trap, Minister,&quot; Bolivar bit out in his most aristocratic voice, &quot;I suggest that the Commonwealth should clean up its own mess from now on.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The Empire is still a threat to your worlds, Archduke Bolivar,&quot; Fremont replied with a measure of venom in his voice, &quot;It is in your best interest to continue the war.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Gentleman,&quot; Dylan interjected, &quot;Please take your seats. Let's try to discuss this calmly.&quot; <br>
<br>
When both men had returned to their seats Dylan continued, &quot;The tactical data provided by the Drago-Kazov Pride, and the date retrieved by our own Captian Valentine proved absolutely invaluable in the recent strike on the primary Imperial base in the Cheops system. Most Imperial forces have withdrawn to the system catalogued as T-12D-32147-C were the conduit to their galaxy is located. This conduit system is well defended and is being used as a strike point for raids on nearby planets.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What do you intend to do about this,&quot; Bolivar demanded. <br>
<br>
&quot;I intend to build a large enough coalition to drive the Imperial forces back through the conduit and then destroy it by whatever means are necessary.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid our members are not willing to contribute more forces to this battle Captian,&quot; Fremont told him, sending a glare to Bolivar, &quot;If the Archduke is willing to maintain his Prides presence for what should be the final battle of this war, then you'll have this ships you had at Cheops. If not then other members might withdraw their forces as well.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me what you intend to do Captain,&quot; Bolivar said shaking his head in resignation, &quot;If it is a worthy plan my forces will be at your disposal.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Captian Dylan Hunt, may I present Fleet Marshal Cuatemoc of the Drago-Kazov Pride and General Red Glow at Daybreak, Holoes of Bloody Shadow, Clarion of Loss, of the Than Hegemony,&quot; Rommie said as the two commanders walked into the conference room aboard the Andromeda. <br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome both of you,&quot; Dylan said as they approached the table Dylan was standing behind, &quot;It is good to see you both again.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I trust my tactical data came in handy Captian,&quot; Cuatemoc said smugly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Very much,&quot; Dylan told him, &quot;Our loses at Cheops would have been much higher without it.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps you can tell us why we are hear,&quot; the red carapace Than-Thre-Kull buzzed, &quot;I don't particularly enjoy sharing space with Nietzcheans.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Few inferior species do,&quot; Cuatemoc shoot back. <br>
<br>
&quot;Very well,&quot; Dylan said ignoring the Nietzschean's response, &quot;The Commonwealth's recent victory over the Empire at Cheops has presented us all with an opportunity to end this war. We have the location of the Empire's main access point to this galaxy. When we are ready, I want us all to be there to take it out.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The Empire still maintains bases on other worlds,&quot; Cuatemoc pointed out, &quot;The war will not simply end by destroying this access.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Without the support of their main fleet, the bases wont be able to stop us from liberating those worlds.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You understand that my people will not want work with Nietzscheans,&quot; Clarion of Loss told them, &quot;Particularly Drago-Kazov Nietzscheans.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;They wont have to,&quot; Dylan told her, &quot;We can hammer out the details later, but each fleet should maintain operational autonomy.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;This could be acceptable,&quot; the Than decided. <br>
<br>
Dylan smiled, &quot;Good, then let's get to work on the details.&quot; <br>
<br>

A human once said the &quot;devil was in the details,&quot; but rarely had the statement been more true. Rev Bem had torn into the swarmships database as soon as he was able, he need hard evidence to show Dylan the danger. <br>
<br>
Nearly three thousand swarmships were gathering. It was the largest single swarm that he had ever heard of and they were going to attack this Empire and utterly destroy it. Many of the ships carried Point-singularity Projectors, weapons that could destroy worlds. <br>
<br>
Rev dropped himself back into the pilot seat, he had less then a week before the Magog were ready to strike. And after the battle they would turn to destroy the known worlds. <br>

Vader hated waiting. <br>
<br>
Twenty Imperial Mark II Star Destroyers, the best ship Vader could find were arrayed around his Command Ship the Executor. It was enough firepower to leave entire worlds nothing but smouldering slag without an effort. This fleet alone could have stood against either the Separatists or the Old Republic in the opening stages of the Clone Wars and not have lost. All this power was to be arrayed against a new galaxy and perhaps against the Empire's own ships. <br>
<br>
Lord Krell was arrogant and foolish. Did Krell really believe that he that could hold the true Dark Lord of the Sith back without consequences? <br>
<br>
The Emperor had ordered Vader to wait just a few more days before going in to remove Krell on his own. He said he did not want to lose the Lusankya over this or risk losing forever this new galaxy. <br>
<br>
What the Emperor seemed to not realize was that Krell was a dangerous man, more dangerous than even Vader would ever admit to anyone else. The lesser Dark Lord had something planned, something that was evil enough that it would disturb the Emperor himself. <br>
<br>
&quot;Admiral Ozzel,&quot; Vader voice boomed, &quot;Open a channel to Imperial Centre, I would speak with the Emperor.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
The Emperor waited nearly three hours before returning Vader's call. <br>
<br>
The Emperor had decided to forgo his usual holoprojector setting, one of a dominating large head, for a wider panoramic view of one of his favourite Throne rooms on the Imperial capital world. Palpatine had decided to call his world Imperial Centre, forgoing the ancient name of Coruscant. <br>
<br>
Personally Vader like the old name better. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is it my servant,&quot; the Emperor demanded quietly. <br>
<br>
&quot;The fleet is ready my Master,&quot; Vader told him, &quot;I am ready to take command of our forces on the other side of the conduit. I ask you blessing on an early departure for your glorious forces.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Your thoughts betray you my friend,&quot; the Emperor said with a disquieting smile, &quot;You wish to leave now so that you may wring the life out of one of my servants. Why? <br>
<br>
Vader starred at his master for a moment in silence, there was no hiding from the Emperor's gaze. <br>
<br>
&quot;I do not trust him, my Master. He is dangerous to us.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I foresee no danger, Lord Vader. You will wait.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, my Master,&quot; Vader responded. <br>
<br>
The communication closed and Vader was left to wallow in his own frustration. <br>
<br>
<br>
Returning to the bridge Vader approached Admiral Ozzel, &quot;The Emperor commands that we wait, we will wait for one week. If Lord Krell has not answered me by then the consequences will be on his own head.&quot; <br>

Harper and Trance watched in fascination as Luke went through his Jedi exercises. He told them during the flight back from Kafreion that his old master, Obi-Wan Kenobi had left taught him only a little of the Jedi ways, but it was enough that he was able to do a few exercises that strengthened him in the Force. <br>
<br>
Luke had asked Harper to build him something called a &quot;remote,&quot; a small ball-like device that shot little stinger bolts at him. The unit Harper had built was simple enough and seemed to satisfy Luke as he continued to practice with the small device. <br>
<br>
&quot;He's pretty good with that thing,&quot; Harper said indicating the lightsabre. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, he is,&quot; Trance replied. <br>
<br>
&quot;I wish I could do stuff like that, its just so cool,&quot; Harper told her, &quot;I mean if I could do the stuff Luke's doing, old Mister Mental back there wouldn't hadda chance.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Luke is training to be something, Harper,&quot; Trance began, &quot;Something he doesn't fully understand yet. When he does it will change him forever.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Your not afraid of him anymore are you,&quot; Harper asked knowingly. <br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; she told him, &quot;His path is no longer so clear to me. But there is great danger, and horrible trials in store for him. I felt something on Kafreion, a presence, the one I truly feared.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Your not going to tell me any more than that are you,&quot; Harper realized. <br>
<br>
&quot;Not yet Harper, but one day.&quot; <br>
<br>
Luke seemed to have finished his exercise and was walking over to them. <br>
<br>
&quot;That's some pretty impressive stuff,&quot; Harper beamed as Luke approached, &quot;You think you could show me how to do that?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The Force is in all things, &quot;Luke told him, &quot;But not everyone can use it as I can. Besides, even if you did have the ability, I barely know what I'm doing myself, I wouldn't want to teach any one else.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Aw, I understand,&quot; Harper said, &quot;But it was still really cool.&quot; <br>
<br>
Luke looked with confusion to Trance. <br>
<br>
&quot;That means he liked it,&quot; Trance translated. <br>
<br>
&quot;I see,&quot; Luke replied, &quot;Well, I'm beat. See you two later.&quot; <br>
<br>
After Luke had left Harper picked up a piece of piping nearby and began swinging it around like a lightsabre. <br>
<br>
&quot;Aw, Trance, wouldn't be great to have that kinda power, to be a guardian of Justice and all that,&quot; Harper said. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your on a High Guard Warship,&quot; Trance told him, &quot;Your already a guardian of Justice.&quot; <br>
<br>
Trance left Harper alone to think about that. Not long after Harper dropped his make-believe lightsabre and walked happily back to his workshop. <br>
