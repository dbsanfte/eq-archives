Don't feel like you are the only one. I had an abortion at the age of 18. I had a boyfriend (who is now my husband) we were only dating for about 2 months and he was a student trying to better his life. I was busy parting and being 18. I would have never been able to give up a child. I would have not been a good parent. I don't think that our relationship would have made it through the first year of the child life. So I would have been a single mother on welfare. <br>
We talk and think about that baby all the time. It is really hard because all three of my pregnancies I have thought how could I already love this child and not love the one we didn't keep. We have a lot of conflicting emotions. Honestly I cant say that I totally regret it. I know we wouldn't have the opportunities we have. After we had are first child and felt the strain of what a child brings. I know that we wouldn't have had a future together. Come on we were only dating for like 2 months.<br>
I have 2 awesome kids and one on the way that would not have happened. So no i cant say that totally regret the decision we made.<br>
I have a lot to say but having a really hard time articulating myself.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>More than 95 percent of the millions of abortions performed each year extinguish the life of a fetus conceived by consensual relations. Thus the effect in over 95 percent of abortions is not to vindicate choice but to avoid its consequences.  Using arguments of “choice” to try to justify altering the consequences of choice is a classic case of omitting what the Savior called “the weightier matters of the law.”<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Dag - abortion IS a consequence. It is one women must face as part of their options when pregnant. If it wasn't a consequence then none of those sharing their stories with us would still to this day have feelings about it. No woman is left without some lingering doubt or sadness. Its part and parcel. It doesn't make their choices wrong, however. Not facing the consequence would be the teen having the baby and then her parents raising the child as if it were their own. Then it becomes the parents (or grandparents really) consequence... for something they didn't even due. <br>
<br>
Right now I'm struggling with a way to approach my little sister on how she is doing. When we were home I got a feeling she is having difficulties coping with her choice even though it probably was the best for her. But I don't know how to approach her about it, I don't want to make matters worse for her. And with it being very long distance now I don't know what I can do. <br>
<br>
I'm just thankful she was able to have it done in a clean and safer enviroment. <br>

Calling it &quot;the consequence of choice&quot; is the same as saying the &quot;choice&quot; to have sex should be punished with pregnancy and parenthood. It takes nothing into consideration other than sex was had and therefore the woman (never the man) must be punished! Breakout the scarlet letter!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Easy to say for your little apostle who will never be pregnant, will deny he's the father, duck and run and be knocking up some other chick next week. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   &quot;Men&quot; like this are legion and they are a pox on humanity. <br>
<br>
Men would never stand for women flatly refusing them sex, now would they? When in the hell are they going to stand up and take THEIR lumps for &quot;the consequences&quot;? <br>
<br>
BTW in my case not only the sex was &quot;consensual&quot; but the pregnancy was deliberate. If you believe in &quot;god&quot; then I guess you think he gave my baby lethal defects too. And you call him moral?<br>

I know of several failed marriages where the woman assuered her partner that she was on the pill, or using a diaphragm, or infertile and was really seeking military spousal support, then married the GI only to fail when it turned out she was interested in the meal ticket.  I even have a family member who was the result of her father trying to trap her mother into an unwanted relationship by intentionally knocking her up and poked holes in their condoms.<br>

It's true their are bad apples in both barrels. This is just a hot button issue for me. I have 7 nieces and nephews from unplanned pregnancies. The oldest is 29, the youngest is 11. One person could not live for 6 months on the collective &quot;child support&quot; they've received from all their neer-do-well &quot;fathers&quot; put together in their entire lives. My sisters bore ALL of the burdon, social, financial and emotional, for raising these kids. The first two of these pregnancies happened to my oldest sister when she was 15 and 17. The fathers were in their 20's and 30's respectively. Yes she was foolish, yes my parents should have put a chastity belt on her and tossed the key... By why did this little girl get stuck with everything while grown men who statutorily raped her just walked away - no shame, no child support payments, not even a stretchmark to pay for their &quot;fun&quot;?<br>
<br>
But no, I don't think men are the root of all evil and I do think women have the greater responsibility because they face the greater risk. I will teach my daughter that! Yes I've known of a few women who tricked guys by getting pregnant - what losers!<br>
<br>

<br>
But I wanted to add one thing:  while there are plenty of couples out there looking to adopt a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>healthy, white newborn</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with a documented family medical history, there are few families who are looking to take in a child of a minority with a drug problem.  White babies draw premiums for adoption agencies;  black ones do not. . . and many of them wind up in foster care for most of their infancy, at which point - regardless of color - they are less likely to ever be placed in a permanent home.<br>
<br>
Recently, I saw John Irving speak at the UNLV Barrick Lecture series.  He spoke of his research in preparing to write _The Cider House Rules_ and said that, in reviewing files from orphanages from the early part of the last century, he would find pictures of the same children growing older, year by year.  So few of them were ever adopted.  The legalization of abortion in the country coincides with the extinction of the American orphanage.  It is naive to think the number of adoptions in the country would increase to absorb the number of unwanted children if Roe v. Wade were overturned.<br>

However, on the issue of laws and abortion, I still maintain my position that you cannot legislate something like this. Sure, pass laws but people will still have abortions. They will just be &quot;illegal&quot; just like people do drugs with laws against them, people steal, kill, cross the street without a crosswalk, go over the speed limit, etc. Laws are only as good as people obey them. <br>

They did end up getting custody and adopting him (after making compromises such as attending a black church so he could be around &quot;his&quot; people. A few years later, they attempted adopting another African American child. This also ended up in the courts and (in the end) they did get to adopt him, but they said they would never do it again because the court battles are just too emotionally draining.<br>

<br>
I am pro-choice - You choose to practice safe sex or you choose to accept the consequences(not punishment- con sequence.) of your actions.  If I drive drunk and kill someone, it doesnt matter what the reasons behind it are.  I did something and there are natural consequences of those actions.<br>
<br>
As dag mentioned briefly, the LDS church opposes abortion, but allows for exceptions (not meaning they make the choice for the person but our doctrine accepts the following exceptions<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Rape, Incest, danger to the life of the mother and situations such as one of the ladies here described where the fetus was so malformed that life could not be sustained outside the womb.   <br>
<br>
The lifes of these fetuses are not any less valued, but in the situations of rape and incest, the woman was not involved in the choice or behavior that caused a pg against her will.    In the other situations, mom in danger, I think that is obvious, loose one or loose both.  In the last situation again, that life is going to end.  Why cause it to suffer unnecessarily.  We accept these exceptions , but encourage any woman, girl who finds herself in one of these situations to make the decision prayerfully.<br>
<br>
Until abortion is illegal, which may be never, I do think that every girl who would like to have an abortion should be educated as to the development of the fetus.  (A picture of where that fetus is along in development so that the decision can be an informed one, not based on the fallacy that the fetus is &quot;just a clump of cells.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I also think that any abortion procedure that&quot;rips&quot; the fetus apart should be outlawed as it is cruel and may cause inexplicable pain to the fetus (since they dont have a voice they cant tell us ,yet thy do have nerve cells so we must assume that they feel what is happening.)  I also would be happy to see late term and partial birth abortions banned (with the exceptions noted above)<br>

I understand what you are saying, your argument is a common one (and admittedly more compassionate than the &quot;no abortions ever&quot; Jesse Helms approach). But it has some weakeness.<br>
<br>
Please elaborate on the following from earlier posts in this discussion:<br>
<br>
If it's &quot;fair&quot; for the woman to &quot;accept the consequences&quot; of her actions, what are the consequences for the man who also chose to have unprotected sex? Is he not every single bit as culpable as she is? Why or why not (and please don't say &quot;God didn't make him to carry babies&quot; because there are a lot of atheists and agnostics here who won't buy that. And if you're talking about US law then it fails the SOCAS test.)<br>
<br>
To be fair, perhaps the man should be made to wear one of those lead pregnancy bellies for 9 months, buy a whole new wardrobe to accommodate it, at the end of the 9 month he must push a cinderblock out of his naval for 18 hours (and if he can't do it, they'll cut it out with a knife). Then he must take 6 unpaid weeks off of work to recover. Oh, and he immediately becomes someone's unpaid personal body servant for 18 years and if he is ever neglectful or abusive he can go to jail. <br>
<br>
Also, what about the burdon of proof for whether it WAS rape? One of our correspondents here told us her devastating story of rape. I guess you did not read it, (I hope you didn't just conveniently ignore it because it didn't fit your argument).  Had she been impregnated, how could she have proven it was rape and should she have had to prove it? Do you really want to add to the burdens of women who are raped by making them go to court, etc. before they can terminate? But if you don't make them go to court, any pregnant woman could claim she was raped, right? So how do you handle it?<br>
<br>
You also said the consequence (being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term) is for &quot;unprotected sex.&quot; But what about birth control failure? It happens all the time - in fact, abstinence is the only 100% effective method of birth control. So you have a woman who did &quot;practice safe sex&quot; but is pregnant just the same. Why do you still feel the need to punish her with &quot;consequences&quot; that she will face the rest of her life?<br>
<br>

<br>
I don't know what the differences are in the laws, but a lot of the perceptions about late-term abortion in the US are colored by pro-life rhetoric. My termination was at 20 weeks (fetal defects) and even so was difficult to obtain. I had to travel 2 hours away to a hospital in a major city, had to have ultrasounds done to confirm the fetus was less than 24 weeks (interestingly - that's the &quot;viability&quot; test which is assanine when you are carrying a non-viable fetus!). I had to sign consent forms and view fetal pictures and then wait 48 hours which meant driving back home, waiting through the weekend and then driving back again. (Like I hadn't already thought it through, like I was going to change my mind and decide to give birth so he could suffer and die of heart failure - give me a break!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Anyway, pro-lifers use terms like &quot;abortion on demand&quot; and &quot;partial birth abortion&quot; to make it sound like any woman, at any stage of pregnancy can just pop into a clinic during her lunch hour and say &quot;My skirt is too tight, I demand an abortion NOW!&quot; and they'd do it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
They bring this up CONSTANTLY because of course, who would agree with aborting a viable baby? Nobody would, not even me, a total pro-choicer. They bring it up because it gives them the moral highground. But because they talk about it non-stop, it creates the perception that it's a common occurance when it just isn't happening at all.<br>
<br>
I challenge any pro-lifer who believes we have &quot;late term abortion on demand&quot; to call up the nearest women's clinic and tell them you're in the third trimester with a healthy normal pregnancy and you want an abortion. Just try it, then let us know if they tell you to come on in.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The only women I have ever heard of having 3rd trimester abortions did so for severe, lethal defects. Period. NEVER have I heard of someone aborting a healthy fetus in the 3rd trimester. As far as 2nd trimester, they are rare and the majority of those abortions are done for girls under the age of 15 who were in denial about being pregnant; followed by married women terminating after very poor prenatal diagnosis. <br>

I had my ab. 4 days after I found out I was pregnant. that means I was about 2 1/2 weeks gestational. The fetus didn't have a brain or a heartbeat or a nervous system. Does that make me better? Does that make me better than DL just because mine was before all of the baby development? I don't think it does. <br>
Maybe you have never had to make a hard choice in your life, but I have. I have had to make a 100 hard choices. That is part of life. If you think that god guides us and has a plan for us who is to say this isn't what he had planned for me?<br>

Another thing I wonder is, why are pro-lifers so concerned about fetal development &amp; feeling but they are also against the &quot;morning after pill&quot; which prevents implantation; and very early abortificants such as RU486? Many of them are against birth control, especially the pill, and they believe only married women should have access to any bc.  To me, this just says the underlying agenda is sexual control of women.  <br>
