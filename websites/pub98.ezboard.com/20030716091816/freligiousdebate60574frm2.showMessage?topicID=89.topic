I completly agree with you that tone and intent is not always carried well over the net. I know that I have seen many things that your David has said in jest, but I had not taken it that way (like the laws of gravity) until he pointed it out. I can also see how he meant it (in this thread) as a joke, but when I read the entirety of his post, I was a little offended. Since I am 37 weeks pg and very emotional (and vocal) at this point in time, I decided to just let it be. I think I was offended because the popups have only just started today (I think) and he came on saying this. You are right about something else though... he did say it may be out of line and the above thread is pretty lenghy (I know I do not always read the long posts, but the posts in the thread above were pretty short). <br>
<br>
Anyway, even though I did not say anything to directly to him, I am sorry for thinking badly. He is only human and so are we <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Are you suggesting there are no trolls here?  Are you subconsiously feeling like one and offended for that reason?  Do you think dag is an a'hole or just that we think he is? Do not blame me if you do, I actually said I enjoyed some of the troll exchanges.  <br>
<br>
Furthermore, my 3 halves = a whole/a'hole mathematics was likewise in jest and directed sympatheticly to Raz.  It is a long standing joke that many I know of have heard, so if you were unexposed to it and take offense or draw from it personally, it is your baggage to carry.  <br>
<br>
If you must know what I think of dag, I find him wearysome and mentally lazy.  If he'd get off his arse and read some of the books, perhaps we could hold a real debate instead of spend all our time trying to bring the kid up to speed.  He might have some potential, but we won't know until he does and I'll not be honing my skills until then, just spinning my mental tires. <p>DBC67<br>

<br>
I thought a troll was a &quot;hit and run&quot; poster, or someone whose goal is to stir up trouble.  So, no I don't think I'm a troll, and of course I don't think dag is a jerk.  I married him, after all.<br>
<br>
&quot;For the record&quot; I'm not personally offended.  The whole time I've been here, the only time I was offended was when you compared my son to Bin Laden and Hitler.  Now I'm just defending a loved one.  Surely you'd defend your wife if you felt she was being attacked unfairly?<br>

As far as the Adolph Bin Laden thread, my point was not that your child IS going to be one, just that it is more likely with a strong religous foundation and it is irresponsible to ignore that as a parent.  After all little 'dolfie and osammy were kids once too and I am sure their mommy and daddy never thought they'd grow up to make the marks they did on the world.  To deny it reactively is to have blinders on to the consequences of our parenting.  My wife is fully able to tear people up on her own and doesn't need me to step in.  Heck, she keeps me in check so she is a pretty tough lady.<br>

I'm not.  I didn't come into this thread to debate with you.  As I said, I no longer think you were referring to dag in that way.  I didn't get the joke originally, and now I do.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure your wife could take care of herself, but if she didn't know she was being slandered, wouldn't you say something?  Dag hasn't read any of this thread.  Since I read it, I stepped up.  <br>
<br>
I completely disagree with you that the children of religious people are more likely to end up like Bin Laden or Hitler.   Well adjusted children will eventually make their own choices in life, regardless of what their parents religious affiliation is.  <br>

I'm just going to bash you for your bad manners. You didn't even bother to thank Leah for her generousity in paying for our premium service on this board - a service that will stop the dreaded pop-up ads. Instead you just ran off to another board - and invited everyone else to evacuate this board with you. <br>
<br>
You're like the guy who doesn't pitch in for the party keg, drinks his fill then splits for the next party (expecting a carload of people to come with you) the minute the hostess goes out to the store to buy another keg. <br>

If we lose our theists, then it just becomes another A/A support board.  A/A support boards are good, but we already have one over at BabyCenter.  Our whole purpose of being here is to debate with those who feel differently than we do, and if the &quot;other side&quot; leaves, then there goes the debate.  I also don't personally believe that the theists are here for any different reasons than the atheists.  I think both sides have strong convictions, otherwise they would be too afraid to venture over here.  I read the thread on the Christian board at BC a few weeks ago where they talked about this board.  Many of them wouldn't have the nerve to venture over here, some just might not have had the interest.  Dag, Misty, Candy, Kate, etc give us different perspectives on things, and I don't want to drive them away.  Okay, maybe dag is a little over the top, but where would a debate board be without at least one of those on each side?  I want to encourage people on both sides to stick around here, otherwise this board will end up dying a slow death.  JMO.<br>
