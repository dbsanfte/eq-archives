And I think its depressing to hear it out of a child's mouth. And its really something that only use when I'm really really pissed off. Sad to say I've told DH to f-off a few times during very stressful situations. And a few f-yous as well. I guess because I usually only use it when I'm being very mean and its wrong. <br>
<br>
DD has used a few of the words she has heard us say, but nothing in a memerable situation. But I do remember when my little sister first said &quot;damn it&quot;. We were driving in the car and Dad hit a curb and she was just got this look on her face and said &quot;DAMN IT&quot;. It was hysterical.<br>
<br>
And my parents love the tell the story of how they were driving my mother's grandmother (very proper southern lady, she scared my Dad those first few years of their marriage) and my older sister was in the car. They got cut off by another driver and when Dad didn't say his usual saying, my sister said &quot;was that a son of a bitch Daddy?&quot;<br>

Cranny seems like an apt euphamism to me. When my sister's kids were small and in the tub, she'd put on a sing-songy Swedish accent and remind them: &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Don't forget to clean the craaack of your kraaay-kel</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!&quot; <br>
<br>
They knew what she meant.<br>
<br>
I'm all for teaching proper terminology, but I definitely am more comfortable hearing my kids use a euphamism for parts we don't talk about in polite company. I learned this when I was weaning my daughter at 2.5. I was pregnant at the time, and explained to her that I couldn't nurse because my nipples were sore. So the next thing you know, we're in the middle of the grocery store and she is announcing &quot;My mama has sore nipples!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Oh for the days when she simply referred to my breasts as &quot;side.&quot; (As in &quot;other side?&quot;)<br>

My daughter banged her foot once and yelled “BAM IT!” very clearly.  DW gave me such a look.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think people judge you on how you speak. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Absolutely.  It is a sign of intelligence to have a broad language grasp.  In China they have thousands of characters in their written language and they evaluate people upon how many they know, the same goes for many cultures.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Francis is a very rare name here these days<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> How about Randal?  I have a friend named Randy that got a lot of guff when he went to the UK…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I honestly never thought of the N word because it is so disgusting same with fag or faggot. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I don’t really see the word nigger as bad, I see the meaning behind it use.  When I was in the army I hung out in one unit with a bunch of black guys.  They called themselves bruthas and in my association with them I did too.  I’ll admit I am a brain snob, I can’t stand to hang out with idiots.  The smart guys in this unit were all black, the rock-stupid drive-me-crazy morons were whites.  I hung out with the blacks. (Ususally there is a mix, this instance it was a clear division.)  They called each other nigger or their GF’s as their Nubian Princess etc and no one batted an eye if I matched pace.  Occasionally someone who didn’t know me would look askance at me but someone who was black would say “he’s down” and that would end it.  It is only a word.  My problem is when it is used with an emotive intent behind it, as in the case of a racist.  If a white guy calls a black guy a nigger to demean them, my problem isn’t with the word, it is with the thought process that makes it bad.  Similarly, when a black guy calls another black guy a nigger in an amicable way, I am bothered if they try and preclude me from participating the same way.  If it is okay for him as a friend to call him his niggah, why shouldn’t I be able to?  So I have disagreements with both sides.  The issue is that they seek to control the negative aspects of the ideas behind the words by just making a rule.  Rules are easy to know and follow, white guy says nigger = bad; black guy says nigger = ok.  When was the last time a white guy got upset being called a cracker or whitey?  I am not a racist, so I don’t like that rule because it makes me out to be one if I say a word irrespective of the intent behind it.  Our insurance agent is Italian and he called himself The Whopper.  Our old receptionist started taking karate and called herself the Ginja (ginny ninja).  Half the bagpipe band calls each other a good ole Mic or a stupid Mic depending on how they played.  They are only words.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So what is it about these words (not the degrading &quot;Stupid, or &quot;shut up&quot; comments - I'm talking the all-out swear words)that make them &quot;okay&quot; for adults to spout off when the kiddos aren't around, but we don't like to hear it come out of our kid's mouths and/or explain why they shouldn't use them? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Well the biggest difference is that kids don’t usually have all the dynamics behind the words connotation when they use it.  Crap, shit, poo-poo, defecation and feces all mean the same, but each has a connotation dependant upon it’s context of use.  Kids don’t grasp that so it is easier to just not let them use the more complex emotive ones until they do understand.  Parental control and freedom of expression need to balance as they learn.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>just what is it about these words that have made them &quot;unacceptable&quot; in public? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don’t think they are unacceptable.  I see them like picking your nose or farting.  You want to demonstrate a lack of self-control in public, go ahead and start digging away in your nostrils “mining for brain-stem” and showing the world your level of personal care.  I think it is crude, I think it is callous, I think it is totally inappropriate, but I don’t think it should be illegal.  I will teach my kids that if they need a tissue to get one and take care of nasal excesses discretely.  The same will go for swearing.<br>
<br>
Euphemisms are a creative way of challenging your mind to express itself in alternate styles.  These can also tie into intelligence and you will see loads of double-entendre in discussions among smart people.  The scientists where I work never stop.  I will encourage my kids to use them too for the same reason.<br>

Along that same vein, I've heard gay men (in particular) call themselves and each other &quot;fag&quot; in an unoffensive manner.  On a smaller scale, in the town where my parents come from--Seabrook,  which has long been the whipping boy of the NH seacoast--people call each other &quot;Bubba&quot;, but will not tolerate being called that by folks from other towns.  Does anyone know if this kind of linguistic double standard exists in other languages and cultures?<br>

I think this is more common than we realize. I would laugh if my sister or girlfriend called me a &quot;bitch&quot; but I would NEVER tolerate that coming from a male stranger. In the same way, I can say a totally joking FU to my husband and we will both laugh. But I would never say those words to him in an argument. So the standard is about familiarity and context.<br>
