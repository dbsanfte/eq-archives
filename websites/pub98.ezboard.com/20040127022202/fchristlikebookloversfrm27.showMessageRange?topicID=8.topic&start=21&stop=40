Now, I've done a ton of reading, so here goes:<br>
I got Someone Like You, which is an awesome book by an awesome author-Sarah Dessen, who also wrote Keeping the Moon, which is also awesome!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's about a girl (Scarlett) who gets pregnant, the father of the baby dies, and how her best friend deals with it.  It's not the most morally correct book-but excellent, and very true.  I also read Squashed by Joan Bauer, who I love-she wrote Backwater (read it!  now!  Go!), Hope Was Here, Rules of the Road, and more.  I love her books, they're so quirky, but good.  They're definitely unforgettable, because they're about the strangest things.  For example, this one was about a girl who grew pumpkins, and wanted hers (Max) to win a big prize.  It was crazy, but excellent!  Today I started 'Hang A Thousand Trees With Ribbons' (I know, I was supposed to start ages ago!), which so far is excellent.  I love how Ann Rinaldi takes real people, and makes you feel like you know them.  It's an amazing gift, and I really enjoy her books!  I'm happy I've been reading more lately, it puts me in a good mood.<br>

I have a newsflash for anyone living in a cave-it's HOT outside. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Like boiling.  Like a million degrees.  And I now, like always remember why I want to move to Alaska or Canada.  Not that the skaters in Canada wouldn't be a bonus.  But I'm really not a fan of hot weather.  And I&quot;m going to stop complaining now, because I'm sure it's not that entertaining.<br>
<br>
Yesterday (when I was allowed to cut school, hee hee <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) I went shopping in a burb a half hour away, just for JC Penneys, my favorite store of all time!!!!  I'm so mad they closed the one close to my house.  They were having a big sale (they always have a big sale!), and I got a TON of stuff, listed below:<br>
1) T-shirt, light blue, very pretty!<br>
2) jean shorts that are actually kind of flattering on me<br>
3) more jean shorts that are very cute<br>
4) light blue spaghetti strap shirt<br>
5) dark blue sleeveless top with 21 on it<br>
6) off-white top with a blue butterfly on it<br>
7) light blue flowery skirt<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  dark blue loose, strechy shorts-very, extrememly comfy<br>
9) light blue loose, strechy pants, for winter, but I'll be wearing them all the time anyway!<br>
<br>
And I was going to buy a jean dress that was very cute, but it was too expensive.  Mean old money.  But anyway, I got all that for under 100 dollars!  Woohoo!<br>
<br>
Yesterday was also my poopy dinner/dance, but I have to go to bed now, so I'll write up that later.  And about skating, which was awesome-I can spin again!  Later!<br>

PS-I found the words on the net so here goes- *It took all the strength I had not to fall apart <br>

I was not at all thrilled about going.  When we came, I talked to a few of my friends, and then I sat down.  Ironically, of all the people I could've been sitting with, I ended up with the infamous (in here) Laura.  We were right by the teacher's table, and I'm about 200% sure my homeroom teacher is incredibly mad at me for cutting, even with my mother's permission, approval, and encouragement.  However, ever since I didn't want to go on the 8th grade trip, he's seemed mad.  And I'm mad, because he's always making comments degrading to women.  Gah!  Ok, enough on that subject.  Laura's mom immediately told us to go get drinks for the parents, which I very much resented-I wouldn't have minded if it was a request, or if my own parents had asked, but I didn't appreciate that.  We then ate (I took two bites of potato salad and one of pasta-seriously, that was all I took), and everyone else had dessert (not me).  After that, they presents awards.  I got the best writing one!  Yay!  *Katherine does happy dance*  You can only get one for academics, and since I wasn't an altar server (I'm out of town for skating a lot on weekends), wasn't the last child, and wasn't on student leadership, I didn't get any of those.  I also got one for the Rebecca Caudill (our state reading program), because I've read all 20 books the past two years.  Then we cleared the floor, and I danced with my dad for the first song.  I stayed for the next two (another father/daughter dance, only I didn't, and the cha cha slide-let me tell you, the girls at skating move 20 times better than the ones at school, they're all so stiff!), and then went home!  Now that I look over this, I realize it's incredibly bitter and resentful, but I really didn't have a good time.  When I went home, I hung out with my friend from skating, Julia, who had been babysitting my brother and sister.<br>
<br>
Yesterday I skated in the morning, and I'm so happy-I can spin again!  I've been kind of off for a while, but it all came back.  I did all the spins I can do in my sleep (scratch, back scratch, sit, camel, camel-sit-scratch, and sit-change-sit), then started working on harder ones (camel-back-camel, layback, flying camel), and they were all going very well!  I started doing these crazy combinations, and it was lots of fun!  I also babysat in the evening, and finished watching the original 3 Star Wars movies.  Julia and I are planning to go see the new one today, and I now have to type my L.A. project.  I'm also going to Ice Dance!!!!!  I love it!!  Hee hee.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :crush --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/love/loveya.gif ALT=":crush"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And there's no one specific there I want to see, of course! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :angel --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/AZZANGEL.gif ALT=":angel"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

PS-tomorrow's my Birthday!  Yay!  14!<br>
PPS-Since no days actually disappeared, I'll just re-post the first verse and refrain now. <br>
*At first I was afraid I was petrified <br>
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side; <br>
But then I spent so many nights <br>
Thinkin' how you did me wrong <br>
And I grew strong <br>
And I learned how to get along <br>
And so you're back from outer space <br>
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face <br>
I should have changed that stupid lock <br>
I should have made you leave your key <br>
If I'd've known for just one second you'd back to bother me <br>
<br>
Go on now go, walk out the door <br>
Just turn around now <br>
('cause) you're not welcome anymore <br>
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye <br>
Did you think I'd crumble <br>
Did you think I'd lay down and die? <br>
Oh no, not I. I will survive <br>
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive; <br>
I've got all my life to live, <br>
I've got all my love to give and I'll survive, <br>

You are currently reading the journal of a girl who has but 5 and 1/2 hours left at Northside Catholic Academy.  Yup, tomorrow's the day!!  Can you say excited?  I can't wait 'till it's over.  My birthday was very fun!  I got the following:<br>
-Center Stage CD (I love the songs, and it's my good luck CD-Liz, one of the coaches, was playing it when I landed my first axel)<br>
-A Walk To Remember CD<br>
-My highlights (I know, they came early!)<br>
-A blown up picture of Michelle Kwan, taken by moi when I went to COI (champions on ice)<br>
-del sol shirt (it changes colors)<br>
-del sol hair clips<br>
-$20 gift certificate to Borders/Walden Books.<br>
Only one of my friends gave me a gift *sniff*  Ah well, I'll survive.  My Grandparents are coming for my Graduation at 1:00 tomorrow-yay!  I love my grandparents!  Despite being out last day, tomorrow will not be fun.  We clean in the morning, then go to St. Jerome's to practice for Graduation, then go to school for lunch and recess, then finish up anything unfinished, then go home.  Gaaah.  I really don't want to do this.  I have a headache just thinking about it.<br>
<br>
Oh!  I finally got a bible!  I've been looking for a while, but I didn't want to buy one because they typically give one to the graduates.  They had a assembly for us today, and it was not at all fun.  8th graders were completely goofing off-going up for the wrong person's name, making snide comments, whispering.  It was driving me crazy.  I'm really not fond of those kids.  We also got a picture of the whole class outside that was used in the yearbook.  The only sad thing at the moment is that I'm going to miss Mrs. Grant, my L.A. teacher (and my Confirmation sponsor), and Mrs. Holley, my librarian.  And to add to the crummy day, every single person who I was hanging out for some reason starting insisting I'd turn 'ghetto' just because I was going to a school on the west/south side.  What was bad was that they said it as if it were degrading, and it shows just how well they know me-hardly at all.  And the two girls most into this were, of course, Laura and Farhana, who were both accepted into NCP.  It's like they need to prove to everyone they're better than everyone just because they were accepted, and the only way they do it is by putting everyone else (specifically the one voted most likely to be sucessful and known as the smartest kid in the class of 2002, aka me) down.  This is not at all fun.  Wish me great luck in survival.  I can tell you, I'll need it.<br>

I finished Hang A Thousand Trees With Ribbons, and while I loved it, reading the author's note was quite depressing, to find out what really happened to Phillis after the book ended.  I'm trying to get myself to start An Acquaintance With Darkness (also by Ann Rinaldi), but have yet to.

You'd think that being out of school, I'd have more time, but, alas, it is not so.  Well, I graduated, which is always a good thing!  I didn't completely enjoy the ceremony, but I'm done.  It was kind of funny walking away, because I was hugging all these people I hardly talked to.  I was expecting it, though-when you leave some place, and doubt you'll ever see most of the people again, there tends to be a bit of hypocrisy.  Okay, okay, maybe a lot more than a bit.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   On Friday, I went to a kid's party in the afternoon, and it was pretty fun.  Nothing too thrilling, though.  I had to leave early, though, because I skated Saturday morning.  It was fun!!!  And I was doing pretty well, too.  I took my little sister to Star Wars, because it's an obsession, and I loved it the first time I saw it, so it was an excuse to go again.  Other than that, I really didn't do a lot.  Sunday I went to church, stayed at home, and went to ice dance.  Have I ever mentioned that I love ice dance?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :heart --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/herz.gif ALT=":heart"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's a lot of fun!!!  And now Liz, one of my coaches for my group ice dance (that's all I'm taking now), is going to be giving me private lessons, starting next Monday.  That means I get to test-yay!<br>
Monday I went to my 1A ballet class, which was supposed to be 1B or 1C, but new girls signed up, so my friend and I ended up switiching to the 1C Tuesday class.  However, since I haven't done ballet for a month (there weren't any classes), it was a good thing I went, because I need to get my technique back.  My calves were really hurting yesterday, and for some reason it feels as if I fell on my hip.  I can't for the life of me imagine how that happened, but it's quite painful.  Wait-did I fall Sat?  Hmm...<br>
Also on Monday I had my belated b-day party.  I had Edna, Julie, Ryder, Loca Alana, and Laura over.  I mostly invited Laura because I thought another girl, Nancy, would come, and they'd hang out.  However, Nan wasn't able to, so it was awkward.  Alana, Ryder, and I were being absolutely crazy, and I think we thoroughly scared everyone else.  It was fun!!<br>
Yesterday I skated in the morning, and went to ballet in the afternoon.  I also spent a lot of time writing.  Today I had an utterly dreadful practice-gah.  Bad.  I think it's because I was working so hard on side splits yesterday at ballet, so my reflexes were slow, which doesn't help.  And now (obviously) I'm on the computer again. <br>

I'm currently reading Specter of the Past, a Star Wars book.  This is turning into a very serious obsession, but I don't care-I love it!  I'm taking my time, because it's soooo complicated.  And you thought the movies were confusing...<br>

It's Post-Return of the Jedi, and is about the Empire trying to return to power with a guy named Flim disguesed as the late Thrawn.  I have a quick question-who exactly was Thrawn?  I need to do my catch up work if I'm going to understand that.  Anyway, according to my friend that I borrowed it from, Mara Jade and Luke fall in love, which is cool.  I'm also trying to get ahold of The Courtship of Princess Leia, which is when she married Han, which should be interesting.  I bought Attack of the Clones, just because I love the movie.  But does anyone else find it utterly depressing that the incredibly cute Hayden Christianson aka Anakin Skywalker is going to turn to the Dark side?  I do.<br>
<br>
I haven't been doing much lately, but my mom has limited my internet time, so I only have an hour a day.  Tell me, how am I supposed to get here, GLO, my Michelle Kwan forum, My Jamie and David forum, fanfiction.net, and my Star Wars forum and website, all in an hour?  I'm currently fifteen minutes over, but I'm almost done.  Then again, fanfiction.net is down, so I don't have to go there.  I'm working on convincing her to add a half hour.<br>
<br>
I also went out with a friend to eat for a semi-graduation celebration.  Another girl I know has her party today, and everyone was talking about it, only she didn't invite me (she mentioned it, but never gave me a date and time), so that wasn't very fun.  I went skating this morning, had a good practice (double loop was sooo close!), and have been reading and writing non-stop.  Okay, my mom will no doubt come up soon, so I have to get off.  Buh-bye!<br>

<br>
Now, let it be known far and I wide that I positively loathe needles, doctors, and, specifically, having my blood drawn.  Yuck!  Yes, this happened to me yesterday.  I switched offices because the two doctors I liked the best at my old office both left, and I wasn't comfortable with the one doctor they had left.  Anyway, these people are now on my really bad side-I haven't had blood drawn since I was five, for heaven's sake!  I haven't gotten a shot since then either, but I remember saying that the shots didn't hurt, and the blood did.  Well, I don't have another shot until September (only ER's have a supply of tetnus boosters, I guess.  That's not good!), but getting my blood drawn really hurt.  I am not at all a fan of pain (who is), and I was very unhappy they were going to do that.  Even worse, it bruised, so it still hurts now.  And they did it on my right arm, and I'm a righty, which means for some time yesterday I had to try to figure out how exactly I could do things with my left hand.  Anyway, I'm still whing (obviously!) and I'm still in pain!<br>
<br>
I've been doing a lot of skating lately-I do love having no school!  I had my first private ice dance lesson with Liz on Monday, and it was a lot of fun!  And some good news-I am finally started to remember the dances, which is something I've never quite excelled at.  Don't ask me why, because I haven't a clue.  So, it's lots of fun, and Liz said the one thing I have to work on is confidence, and I find that kind of amusing, because that's always been my problem!  I get the moves, but I'm really not very agressive.  That part of my personality really shows through in my skating style.  I've decided that I really hate ballet in the summer-don't get me wrong, it's fun, but it's HOT!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And Katherine is not in any way, shape, or form, a fan of heat.

Actually, I think he's been there twice, so he should be well prepared!  It's going to be quite the event, because we haven't had a wedding in our family since I was in 2nd grade-wait I know I already posted this!  This shows just how excited I truly am!  I get hyper whenever I think about it!<br>
<br>
And even more news-We're moving!!  We'll be staying in the same general area of Chicago, but different neighorhood for the first time in my life!  I've lived in this house since I was one, and an apartment two blocks away before that.  I have some close friends who I'll be just a few blocks away from, in one case, and half a block away from, in the other!  We're also about three blocks away from a library (always important!), and right by a Metra and el stop, both of which can drop me off right by my school next year!  I'll also have my own room, which is a huge thrill.  We move mid-August, as soon as we come back from Alaska on the 14th.<br>

Well, I finished Specter of the Past and Vision of the Future, and they were pretty good-but also very confusing.

This morning I went to skating at 6:15 (the times get all messed up during the summer at the rink), did off ice for a half hour (yuck!  We had to do running, and all sorts of conditioning at the park), and then had on ice for an hour and 15 minutes (it was supposed to be an hour, but the team before us let us on early).  I have ballet this afternoon, and it's supposed to get up to 96-yuck.  Hopefully it will have cooled down a little by five, as we're supposed to get some thunderstorms-yay!!!  <br>

So, since I obviously survived, it wasn't as bad as I'd originally thought.  I met quite a few people, and I'm putting them all down here, because otherwise I'll have forgotten by September.  British (isn't that a cool name?) is from St. Mary of the Woods (aka SMOW).  She's friends with Alex, Peg, and Kim-some girls who went to NCA.  She's very open and friendly, and plays tennis where I skate.  She claims she's very bad at skating, and she's always making up romances between people.  Lizzette (another cool name!) is a carbon copy of Mariyah, a girl I used to skate with.  She is quite used to the bus (takes it regularly), and also thinks she's awful at skating.  She went to a public school last year (there are too many public schools to remember!), and finds the fact that I skate very amusing.  She has a tendancy to day-dream, and I've already had to tell her what to do many times when we were in the tech lab.  She's also laughing about anything all the time!  She knows a girl named Barbara from her old school.  Paul is the only other guy in our group who went to a Catholic or non-public school, IC (Immaculate Conception).  Kyle is a skateboarder, is going out for football, and for some reason, I want to call him Micheal, and he reminds me of someone, but I don't know who.  Micheala went to Healy (a ton of kids there went to Healy), is tall, pretty, and very nice.  We're programmed for two of the same classes, so we'll see at registration if we got any together.  Denwel (I think that's how it's spelled) also went there, and is taking Honors Math, and all other classes regular.  Racheal wasn't in my group, but went to a Catholic school, and apparently our mom's used to work with each other.  She's very similar to me in many ways, but, unfortunately, I didn't get to know her very well, since we were in different groups for the 2nd two days.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm incredibly relieved I'm in three honors classes, because that means a B in an honors class is an A in a regular-always good for the GPA!  And in AP classes, a C is equal to a regular A!  That's always very good.  Sophomore year I can take one or two of those, and junior year i can take up to 4.  Senior, I want to take a lot!  I hope I can join the NHS-always good for the resume when applying to college.  I also miss skating, because I've had to skip a lot of class for orientation-mean ol' WY!  Okay, my mom needs to clean out her closet now (directly in the way of the computer), so I have to get off now.  Bye!<br>

I haven't written for a while mainly because I didn't have a ton to write about-nothing too thrilling happened this weekend.  We did tons of housework!  Gosh, this moving thing is crazy!  In case you're at all interested, I did all of the following things:<br>
-paint basement bathroom<br>
-paint posts in the basement<br>
-wash windows/storms<br>
-laundry<br>
-dishes<br>
-paint steps<br>
-wash posts on steps<br>
-Pack up my closet<br>
-pack up my books (I miss my books!  I want them back!  I've only got the ones I can keep on my miniscule lil' bookshelf in my room!)<br>
-pack up lots and lots of other stuff!<br>
And I can assure you there will be more to come!  We've only got about a week and a half until we show the house, and hopefully someone will make an offer then.  I went to mass on Sunday, had ice dance this morning (fun!), and ran into a girl I haven't seen for ages!  Vanessa skates at Homewood-Flossmor (a burb), and I never see her, except for summer, only she didn't think she'd be coming this year.  But she did-yay!  I also saw my friend Amber, who skates at Darien (a rink in a far, far away burb called Berwyn), and she's a lot of fun!  I really miss the friends I see over the summer.  Emily, Megan, Haley stayed around for a while after our session, and just talked and hung out, had fun.  Unfortunately, I have to see them tomorrow.  Why is it unfortunate?  Because it's at 6:15 in the morning, and the first thing we have is off-ice, which means lots of running and arms stuff-yuck!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Nevertheless, I will survive!  Wait...that motto's supposed to have changed, I graduated-well, I come up with something new.  I just talked to one of my cousins (dad's side) on AIM, and she was mad at me again-she keeps on getting mad for small things, and then gets off in a huff.  I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing wrong, but whatever it is, she's not happy with it.  And since that now has me down in the dumps, I think I'll post books and then go read one.<br>

I haven't been reading a lot of new material, but because I was going through Lurlene McDaniel withdrawal, I read 'Time To Let Go,' one of my favorite books of hers.  It's so sweet, I feel like tearing up!  *sniff*  The last paragraph, especially, which I'm going to put in here.<br>
&quot;Again Jody smiled, and the smile washed over Erin like a soothing balm. The child turned, tugged on her friend's hand, and together they darted across the field toward the track.<br>
David said 'I don't get it.  Jody gives you a bunch of raggy weeds, and you start bawling.  Girls are weird.'<br>
Erin poked one of the flowers into his button hole.  'Didn't you know that girls get to cry over dumb stuff for no reason?'  She reached up and placed her palm tenderly along his cheek.  'And so do clowns.'&quot;<br>
Awwwwww.....<br>

I don't have much to say, but a little.  I've been focusing a lot on the hostility from Cristy (my cousin) towards me.  We were rather close when we were younger, but we just grew apart-I turned into the shy, quiet, studious girl I am today, and she turned into a rather (and I'm really not trying to be critcal) superficial girl, always focused on material things, more concerned about popularity and boys than grades.  The other thing about her is that she puts on a show of being a good Christian, but she really isn't.  Once, she went and told her family I was an athiest.  Well, Cristy, thanks for telling me, becuase I hadn't the slightest idea!  Anyway, she's been incredibly insulting lately...called me everything from a snob to bossy...funny-my friends have spent the last year of my life telling me to be more assertive.  She threw a fit because I asked her to stop sending me so many forwards, and she's basically turning everything into a bigger deal than it really needs to be.  I try to stay calm and understanding, but when she was throwing a fit about the forwards, I told her just to let it go-it wasn't a big deal.  That's was when she informed me I was bossy and since she was older than me, what right did I have to be telling her what to do?  I just want to mention that she is older...by nine measly months, and I've spent my entire life being told I act a good 4 years older than I am.  Another thing is that she's been telling her little brother everything (from her point of view, of course), and we usually get along pretty well.  Oh yes, she's been doing this safely over the internet so she can retreat at any time and block me.  May I quote Julie Andrews/Maria von Trapp?  'You can't run away from your fears... you have to face them!'  I couldn't sleep at all last night (well, maybe 4 hours) because I was so worried.  I hate conflicts, and I honestly don't see what I could've done to prevent this, which is even more irritating.  Okay, now that I've dumped that, I'm feeling much better!<br>
<br>
Well, I skated this morning, and hung around an extra 45 minutes talking to Megan, Judy, Francis, and Melanie.  There were a few other girls that left, and for the last 25 minutes, it was me and Megan, and I was telling her all about applying to high school, since she's a year younger than me.  I also ran into my friend Ryder, who I haven't seen in ages (we have drastically different ice times), on the way out.  That's about it for now.<br>

Today I re-read Under a Different Sky (excellent book.  Amazing!), For the Love of Venice (another good book that really shows you an inside view of the tourist trap in Italy), and Betsy in Spite of Herself (I really with Maud Hart Lovelace hadn't died-her books are great!  I can read them over and over and over and over....in fact, I firmly intend to go to the library tomorrow and grab a bunch of 'em!)<br>

Now, I would like to remind everyone I cannot stand the 4th of July, so if you are extrememly patriotic (I'm not-may I quote Peter Tchernyshev by saying I feel more a citizen of planet earth than any country (especially one with such awful ethics!).  I'd also like to quote Maggie from Dreams of Gold by saying I'm thinking of declaring myself citizen of an ice rink!  LOL-That's an idea!), do not read!  Anyway, I'm dead sick of patriotic tunes and especially fireworks.  Yuck.  I really am not a fan of this holiday-I loathe, to be blunt!  I went to a parade in the neighborhood where we'll be moving this morning, and we stayed until 1:00.  So that wasn't too fun.  Let's see, I also went on the computer (you think?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and spent a good hour and a half (probably more!) messing with my sig.  Now I really like it (I think it looks good!), but it's too long, so I'm thinking of taking out a few of my keeperships and putting in a little flower graphic line like so many people have now at GLO.  I tried to put in a Michelle Kwan animated personal pic, but it only worked once, and then it always said 'Hosted by Tripod' so I had to turn it off-Hmph!  I also wanted to put an image in my siggy, but it was too big-Hmph again!  But I did figure out how to get the marquee, which is great-I think I'm going to use various songs skated to by skaters in the future.  Other than sucess, the only good thing is that I got about 10 posts just messing around with it and testing it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I miss skating (the rink wasn't open for my lesson today)-Lately I've only been skating Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  I do hate the summer schedules, although I am actually getting a lot of skating done, since I can stay for longer.  Well, I'm feeling very out of it right now, so I'm going to go read a book and eat some ice cream.<br>
