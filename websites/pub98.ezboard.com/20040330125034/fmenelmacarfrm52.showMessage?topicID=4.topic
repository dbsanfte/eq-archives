<br>
        Two nations were created by exiles from Varja after the revolution. Gozzle’s monarchist country of Czakatus withered away having barely even existed, to the vast relief of those of us who might otherwise have to write histories that include spelling its name. But the other, Sirithil’s republican country of Menelmacar, survived and prospered to become one of the most successful micronational experiments of the present era and “an echo and a light unto Eternity”<br>
        “As you probably already know, Varja has fallen from its noble origins and is now little more than a seething hive of communist villainy. Therefore, I have founded this glorious Imperium in response. Enjoy... all that I promised when elected the rightful leader of Varja, I promise again, and will honor. This may be a monarchy, but it is a monarchy in which the people have a voice, and where the monarch serves the people, rather than vice-versa.”<br>
        A better opening than that of Varja, for certain. This original post on Menelmacar’s boards was made July 25, 2002 by Sirithil nos Feanor. It was slightly misleading – although Sirithil gave herself the title of Elentari, “Queen of the Stars”, it was not so much a monarchy as a republic with a very strong executive. But this point would be the result of months of tiring political debate – and for the present, what mattered was that it was not a communist dictatorship like the alternative.<br>
        What it was was spelled out in the Elentari’s first decree, the Constitution of Menelmacar. The country would be an “Republican Imperium”, which sounds somewhat silly until one remembers Shireroth is an “Imperial Republic” – go figure. Its leader, the Elentari (male form Elenaran), would be elected to a four month term, in which she had the powers to declare war, command the armed forces, issue unilateral decrees, and veto decrees by the legislature. Although this is certainly a large amount of power to concentrate in one individual, in practice it caused surprisingly few problems for the first half of the country’s existence. The legislature would be the Conclave of Equals, which would follow a variant of the ever-popular Timed Direct Democracy system first invented in Jasonia. The final part of the Menelmacari government would be a Cabinet of Prefects each running a particular department.<br>
        The obvious similarities to the United States government continued as the Constitution got into its version of the Bill of Rights. Free speech, keep and bear arms, free press, free religion, free association, free et cetera. The single glaring exception was a hard-coded ban on there ever being a Menelmacari communist party. Despite the discrepancy, no one could really blame them, and the ban has survived to the present day.<br>
        But although the constitution provided a major framework for the country’s direction and future, perhaps more important was the beginning of the nation’s culture. In Elendor, Sirithil had been a High Elf, one of the descendents of the cursed Feanor who were doomed never to rest until they found the Silmarils. She brought this elven flavor to her new country, imbuing every detail with Tolkien references or fantasy themes. The most obvious (and yet least known) such reference is the name of the country itself – Menelmacar (Quenya Menelvagor) is the Swordsman of the Sky, a constellation symbolizing eternal vigilance against the forces of darkness. The executive name, Elentari, is Elvish for “Queen of the Stars”, with the stars being a well known Elvish symbol. The red dagger-star occupying a prominent place on the flag is the symbol of House Feanor and thus Sirithil’s personal crest, a fact which has not stopped her opponents from continuing to use it as their symbol. Virtually all the Menelmacari names on the MCS map are lifted directly from the Silmarillion or the Lord of the Rings. However, the ultimate importance of the Tolkien base was perhaps not so much for its own sake but in that it attracted a number of the micronational world’s more fantasy-minded thinkers. <br>
        The first great operation of Menelmacar, and one that never came to fruition, was Operation: Revival. Described as “an attempt to enforce the Hubert Doctrine”, it was begun when a number of micronational leaders, primarily old Apollonians, came to Sirithil telling her that they had a policy of always trying to deal with Thomas Hubert as soon and as decisively as possible, and offering their help should she choose to attempt something. The merits of action and inaction on this subject were discussed back and forth, providing a major boost to the country’s activity and introducing a number of people who might otherwise have not bothered to stop by the latest micronational upstart.<br>
Scott Siskind, who at that time was part of Tymaria, the declining but still influential colossus that had once ruled the world before suffering an agonizingly slow and painful death, briefed Sirithil on the history of the “Hubert Doctrine” as a loose and continual anti-Hubert alliance between most states of an earlier era was called, while Ryan Caruso advocated moderation and a “live-and-let-live” policy, saying that although Thomas had used EZOp power to steal Varja, he was not an immediate threat and therefore should not be considered a problem. It is widely considered that if even Ryan “WarVoid” Caruso wants peace on a matter, then peace is probably the only viable option, and the issue was slowly and regretfully closed.<br>
        Yet by this time, Varja was slowly fading from even the most militant Menelmacari minds as the country developed in its own right and began to grow…and grow…and grow…and grow…and….you get the idea.<br>
