<br>
it wasnt directed at me, but i believe i can elaborate on that sentiment...<br>
<br>
not necessarily legalize drugs, but to decriminalize small quantities(i wouldnet assume to define what small quantity would be, prob different for each type of drug) would inevitably lead to a better prison system that would cost taxpayers much less money. which would in turn decrease crime and possibly lead to more children having both parents in their lives. taxing the decriminalized drugs would lead to revenues that could be either dumped into the schools as someone else said, or used to provide rehab services, etc. i know these are broad statements, but it isnt hard to see how the decriminalization of drug use would benefit our society.  <p>&quot;i think the good book is missing some pages&quot;<br>

<br>
Decriminalizing marijuana is advocated even by ultra-conservatives like William F. Buckley and would surely get us out of some rather ridiculous political situations (can you say Noriega?) not to mention force us to deal with the REAL causes of drug addiction in this country. <br>
<br>
Unfortuneately, throwing everyone in jail and characterizing drug dealers as the worse scum of the earth-below murderers and rapists appeals to the sheeple masses out there who want a fast, easy solution and don't bother to notice that this &quot;War&quot; has been neither.<br>
<br>
P.S. I keep hearing the right say if we legalize drugs everyone will be running around with needles in their arms but I can tell you the reason I don't use heroine has NOTHING to do with it's being illegal and I never like pot, but see nothing wrong with that either if used in moderation (just like beer). Smoking kills more people than every single narcotic put together each year, but how are we attacking that? Public health messages and making it uncool. <br>
<br>
P.S.S.--those commercials about supporting terrorism with drug money could be used to say exactly the SAME things about our tax dollars. They are stupid and pander only to those who know nothing about addiction.<br>

<br>
My father spent over twenty years of his life as a special agent for the DEA.  His life was routinely in danger as he worked the drug-related homicide task force in Miami, as he followed heroin traffickers from Thailand through Europe to the US, and as judges and agents in high profile cases received death threats from Colombian drug lords.  He and I have discussed the war on drugs - which accounted for a huge part of his life - at great length, and he agrees completely with what I have to say on the matter.<br>
<br>
The war on drugs, as it is currently being waged, cannot be won by the US.  Period.  The only effective way to wipe out this criminal empire is by eliminating the &quot;criminal&quot; aspect, since it is clear that we will never, ever eliminate the &quot;empire&quot; itself.  By decriminalizing the drug industry, we gain the upper hand.   Why?  Basic laws of supply and demand come into play -- legalization would bring drugs out of the back allies and result in legally regulated suppliers, which in turn brings prices down and eventually brings about the end of the &quot;drug lords.&quot; (This is an over-simplification, but it is the general idea).  It would also de-stygmatize drugs and make treatment programs more readily available and effective.<br>
<br>
Americans will spend over $100 BILLION this year alone in arresting, prosecuting, incarcerating, and parolling drug users.  $100 Billion to deal with &quot;victimless&quot; crimes.  <br>
<br>
Repeated studies have shown that people on drugs do not commit crimes -- it's people looking to get money for their next drug purchase who perpetrate crimes.  Eliminate the criminal aspect, lower prices, and allow treatment facilities to supply drugs to junkies in a regulated, gradual reduction program, and you eliminate the crimes these people might have committed to try and get their drugs under our current system.  <br>
<br>
I spent many years in Switzerland, where the government considers drugs a medical issue, not a legal one.  Free needle programs, free treatment facilities. . .yet they maintain one of the highest standards of living, longest life expectancies, and lowest infant mortality rates in the world.  They have a literacy rate of 100% and offer free university-level education to all citizens.  Technically, drugs are not &quot;legal&quot;, and Swiss officials cooperate with American law enforcement in stopping large shipment of drugs from the Far East that are bound for the US.  But NO ONE is jailed for possession, and drug addicts are offered help, not harassment.  Stronger, healthier society?  Without a doubt.<br>

What has the war on drugs earned us that it would be preferable to no waging said war?  Well, as cited already, we have over crowded prisons.  What else do we have?  Lost revenues.  Violence. Deaths.  <br>
<br>
Lost revenues is probably the weakest argument and the most obvious.  No one really does check that box on their income taxes for ‘undeclared income’ and reports their drug sales.  Anyone can see how taxing a recreational drug industry would realize profit.  Just how much you may not know though.  The US Gov’t purchases pharmaceutical grade cocaine (100% pure) at a cost of $35 per vial retail.  The vials are 5 gram vials so it is $7 per gram for use in the medical industry (yes, it has a medicinal purpose and cocanimides are the root drug of many anesthetics and analgesics.)  Contrast this 100% pure vial against the $50 1/8 gram of 40-70% pure product.  <br>
<br>
50% pure 1/8 gram at $50 = $4,000 for that same $35 vial which was ALREADY profitable at $35.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, it isn’t just revenues that are lost.  Our prisons are full of ZERO TOLERANCE drug offenders.  Yet when you look at the record, it is never the Drug Lords in prison, it is the petty dealer or possessor.  They were arrested for having it in their possession.  They were arrested for trafficking in it.  Yet 90% of those traffickers are small time and only sold enough to others to support their own habits.  They didn’t go out and threaten anyone to get them to try it, they are sought out or seduced into selling it by friends who are mistrustful and want their friends to sell to them so they feel safe.  Hardly worth my money each year.  I’d prefer paying someone to keep Jeffrey Dahlmer out of my neighborhood.<br>
<br>
Why do we have deaths?  Well for one, because it isn’t regulated, drug quantities are subject to the tolerances of their market.  The coke you buy in Seattle is of a different grade from that in LA.  Harder to get means more tolerant of a lesser grade product. Let’s say you are a young musician who grew up snorting in Seattle then got a big record deal in LA.  You are used to snorting 3 inches of coke to get high.  You go to LA and buy some that is supposed to be ‘the best’ and it is far more pure than what you are used to in Seattle. For the sake of debate let’s call it 50% pure (WA) vs 70% pure (CA), after all 100% pure is a liquid at room temperature and would kill anyone.  Now then, our intrepid musician snorts his 3 inch line, gets far more than he has ever had in his life, goes into cardiac arrest and dies to the loss of fans every where.  How many times have we seen this same story?  So regulation to standardize naming, labeling, purity, etc is to societies benefit.  Can’t do that if it is illegal.  Perhaps if you equated it to drinking a 16 ounce beer in your home, then going to a bar the next night and ordering the same drink but getting a 16 oz glass of grain alcohol or vodka and pounding it down.  You wouldn't expect it, nor could you control for it.<br>
<br>
Now the least obvious aspect, violence.  Why do we have so much violence around drugs?  People do them to feel good, right?  So why shoot anyone for it?  Well, the first thing you lose when drugs become illegal is access to the law enforcement and court systems in transactions involving drugs.  If you are cutting into my sales territory, I can’t call the cops.  If you sell me a junk product, I can’t sue you.  If you take all my money or product, I have NO recourse.  The only way I can respond is with violence and taking retributive action myself.  With this basic template, the groups that survive and remain profitable in the drug industry are those who are good at violence.  Success in violence is rewarded failure is eliminated.  Furthermore, the crime wrapped around the industry is present in any industry, but it is without recourse.  If a kid wants a Nintendo game and can’t afford it, he might shoplift, or mug an old woman in the park, or steal from mom and dad.  The same thing will happen in any area, but with drugs, the cost is so high and the recourse so impossible that the crimes are reflective of it.  You can’t mug an old lady for a kilo of coke, you need to hit a liquor store, and a pretty successful one at that.  You don’t want a coke-head driving around?  Well we don’t want drunk driving either, so why should it be any different?  We also don’t want anyone driving during the rapture or sex or an epileptic seizure.  So criminalize THAT, not the unnecessary part.  If you want to lay on your floor at home stoned out of your mind, or drunk, or playing Nintendo, or watching porn, or reading bible verses, or other mindless wastes of time, go ahead.  It is not for me to criticize.  Freedom dictates that those are your choices and should have the right to make them.<br>
<br>
Gov’t should act in the best interests of protecting society, not in deciding for itself what people should act like and forcing them to conform (beyond basic safety, obviously.)  Coca growers in South America and abroad grow coca because it is hugely profitable for them as a commodity.  Not because they are evil and want to undermine US culture.  They have families and no car and want to feed their kids just like you and me.  They can grow an acre of coca and carry bushels to a refining plant (a tent with water and a brick to mash the plant) for 1,000 times the money the same acre of corn would yield.  Legalize it and the profit disappears and they go into a different marketable commodity that is more profitable.  <br>
<br>
Yes, I think we would be better off if it were legal.<br>
<br>
One last thing to consider.  Large-scale synthetic plants like DuPont and Dow Chemical would hate to see hemp (the stalk of cannabis AKA marijuana) legalized.  It is an incredibly cheap alternative to their synthetic solutions developed once hemp became illegal.  They will always fund the counter-choice programs for gov’t interdiction and restrictions on our freedom.  It is profitable for them.  Hemp ropes from colonial times are still on display at many historic seaports and museums.  How pleasing would the same display of yellow nylon rope look? <p>DBC67<br>

I am 100% in support of the reform of the drug laws. <br>
I'm a card carrying member of MassCann, the Massachusetts state division of NORML. <br>
Prisons are overcrowded, and a ridiculous percentage of inmates are there for petty drug charges. <br>
Besides all the points mentioned by DBC &amp; Jen, I don't think the gov't should be allowed to tell ANYONE what they can or can not put in their body. <br>
Cholesterol kills, too--should we make a law against red meat? Eating habits? <br>
Drug laws get me all sorts of fired up.<br>
I hope that the laws drastically change at some point during my lifetime.<br>

<br>
While I have never done drugs, the fact that they are illegal was never the reason why. Just never felt the need. I don't understand why pot is illegal - other then from the hemp business which I don't agree with. From what I've seen and what I've been told its less altering the alcohol or even cigarettes. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure about herion being legal. But I think that might be more of my prudishness then any other reason. And I'm all for anything that would mean more money for the government, and maybe less out of my wages (well DH's wages at least <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
I think the war on drugs is a joke. The people I know who have been arrested for drugs are in no way harming anyone else around them. They never once stole anything or got into fights. Nothing. It was a waste of money defending their arrests and even prosucuting them. None of them actually spent any time in jail, but still the money on both side of the issue for the miniscul amount of drugs involved is unbelieveable. I think its a shame. And there are much better uses for that money.<br>
<br>
I say legalize it. I would really like to see those who could use pot medicinally be able to get it, too. <br>

I would like to add that Europe isn't some unregulated drug den as some would imply from their allowing certain amounts of certain types of drugs. They are very clear on what is allowed, and if you step across the line the penalties are quite harsh.<br>
<br>
Plus, European nations have much tougher drunk driving laws than we do. The average BAC limit in the US is .08-.10, in the EU it is anywhere from .02-.08, with the majority around .05.<br>

History of Marijuana Use <br>
<br>
Marijuana has been used as an agent for achieving euphoria since ancient times; it was described in a Chinese medical compendium traditionally considered to date from 2737 B.C. Its use spread from China to India and then to N Africa and reached Europe at least as early as A.D. 500. A major crop in colonial North America, marijuana (hemp) was grown as a source of fiber. It was extensively cultivated during World War II, when Asian sources of hemp were cut off. Marijuana was listed in the United States Pharmacopeia from 1850 until 1942 and was prescribed for various conditions including labor pains, nausea, and rheumatism. Its use as an intoxicant was also commonplace from the 1850s to the 1930s. A campaign conducted in the 1930s by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Narcotics (now the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs) sought to portray marijuana as a powerful, addicting substance that would lead users into narcotics addiction. It is still considered a gateway drug by some authorities. In the 1950s it was an accessory of the beat generation; in the 1960s it was used by college students and hippies and became a symbol of rebellion against authority. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classified marijuana along with heroin and LSD as a Schedule I drug, i.e., having the relatively highest abuse potential and no accepted medical use. Most marijuana at that time came from Mexico, but in 1975 the Mexican government agreed to eradicate the crop by spraying it with the herbicide paraquat, raising fears of toxic side effects. Colombia then became the main supplier. The zero tolerance climate of the Reagan and Bush administrations (1981-93) resulted in passage of strict laws and mandatory sentences for possession of marijuana and in heightened vigilance against smuggling at the southern borders. The war on drugs thus brought with it a shift from reliance on imported supplies to domestic cultivation (particularly in Hawaii and California). Beginning in 1982 the Drug Enforcement Administration turned increased attention to marijuana farms in the United States, and there was a shift to the indoor growing of plants specially developed for small size and high yield. After over a decade of decreasing use, marijuana smoking began an upward trend once more in the early 1990s, especially among teenagers, but by the end of the decade this upswing had leveled off well below former peaks of use.

search for war on drugs, its the first article.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914 was the United States' implementation of The Hague treaty. The act's restriction took the form of a tax, and its purpose was to stop careless prescribing and easy availability of opiates and cocaine. This attempt to establish a national antinarcotic law controlling the health professions encountered serious constitutional impediments, however, and was not upheld by the Supreme Court as a legal prohibition of simple addiction maintenance until 1919. <br>
<br>
The laws against narcotics at the local, state, and national levels early in the twentieth century reflected a strong antagonism to drug use. By 1937 intolerance and fear of drugs had reached such dimensions that the Marijuana Tax Act was passed with little debate. As use of drugs decreased, punishment increased until by 1955 the death penalty for providing heroin to anyone under eighteen was added to federal statutes. Narcotic use retreated to the margins of American society. <br>
<br>
interesting tidbit....<br>
<br>
Heroin, a derivative of morphine, was commercially introduced by the Bayer Company in 1898.<br>
<br>
<br>
once again, it seems it all comes down to education, doctors did not know the effects of these drugs early on and carelessly prescribed them forming addicts, hell a derivitave of cocaine was used to make coca cola.  who knows what we use regularly today that will be known as highly dangerous in the future, in the 50's my gramma was prescribed amphetamines while pregnant to ease her nausea and fatigue. <p>&quot;i think the good book is missing some pages&quot;<br>

Based on what?  The fact that we have fewer infant deaths now than ever before?  Longer life spans?  Lower costs of basic goods?  That the people below poverty level have a better standard of living than the people below poverty level 50 years ago?  That our rich are richer, but even our poor are richer too?  The smallest percent of the population in history has to scratch their subsistence out of the ground and will starve or die at the whim of a weather cycle?<br>
<br>
I think that is a very simplistic and generalized statement that is in every way false.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, all your fears are either unserved by the illegality or hampered by it.  Facts remain that drugs are out there.  If your child wants to try them, there is nothing you can do to stop them.  Nothing.  If they are illegal then the one selling them has no regulation on what a lethal mixture is or standards and tests to confirm once it is mixed.  They have no obligation to sell only to older kids.  It is a free for all.  If they are illegal then there won’t be clean needles available.  If they are illegal then they buy them in back allies off predators.  If you don’t want your kids to be irresponsible with drugs then raise them in knowledge of what drugs can do.  Either way, once they are 18 and out of your house they will do what they want anyway.  The drugs aren’t gone.   An addictive personality will find a means of drowning the pain they are trying to escape.  Whether it is alcohol or heroin, they can find it.  You can addict yourself to Afrin nose spray for crying out loud.<br>

I hope you're not thinking drug laws will keep your kids off drugs.  Education is the way to go.  Legal or illegal, my kids will know the facts about drugs.<br>

People that are against decriminalization have this idea that when we discuss &quot;illegalization&quot;, it means an unregulated free for all, which is not necessarily true. I do strongly believe that marijuana should be sold just like cigarettes, and be totally decriminalized, but I don't feel the same way about heroin or cocaine or other opiates. I think the criminal possession charges should be overhauled, but I don't think you should be able to buy smack at your local Stop &amp; Shop. I also don't think that someone should spend 15 years in jail for possessing a minute amount of LSD. It's not a black &amp; white issue, but the &quot;war on drugs&quot; is complete and utter bullshit, and a 100% waste of time and resources.<br>

<br>
More than ten million americans smoke marijuana regularly. Seventy-seven million americans have tried marijuana at least once in their life. <br>
<br>
In countries where marijuana has been decriminalized, there has a been a significant decrease in the sales and consumption of tobacco and alcohol. <br>
<br>
Alcohol is of course legal, but drinking by minors has declined dramatically over the last twenty years. (Daily use by minors declined from 6.9% to 2.5% between 1979 and 1993.) Experience in Europe suggests that decriminalization does not seem to have an independent influence. There are also risks inflicted on minors by forcing pot underground, including insuring that consumption will never take place under adult supervision, contact with shady characters, and subjecting young people to the tender mercies of the drug war, including arrests and the possible loss of grants, student loans, and jobs. <br>
Marijuana prohibition needlessly destroys the lives and careers of literally hundreds of thousands of good people each year in this country. More than 700,000 Americans were arrested on marijuana charges last year, and more than 5 million Americans have been arrested for marijuana offenses in the past decade. Almost 90 percent of these arrests are for simple possession, not trafficking or sale. This is a misapplication of the criminal sanction that invites government into areas of our private lives that are inappropriate and wastes valuable law enforcement resources that should be focused on serious and violent crime. <br>
<br>
<br>
There is no conclusive evidence that the effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent use of other illicit drugs. Preliminary animal studies alleging that marijuana &quot;primed&quot; the brain for other drug-taking behavior have not been replicated, nor are they supported by epidemiological human data. Statistically, for every 104 Americans who have tried marijuana, there is only one regular user of cocaine, and less than one user of heroin. Marijuana is clearly a &quot;terminus&quot; rather than a gateway for the overwhelming majority of marijuana smokers. <br>
<br>
In Holland, where politicians decided over 25 years ago to separate marijuana from the illicit drug market by permitting coffee shops all over the country to sell small amounts of marijuana to adults, individuals use marijuana and other drugs at rates less than half of their American counterparts. <br>
<br>
According to the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM), fewer than one in 10 marijuana smokers become regular users of the drug, and most voluntary cease their use after 34 years of age. By comparison, 15 percent of alcohol consumers and 32 percent of tobacco smokers exhibit symptoms of drug dependence. <br>
<br>
And don't even get me STARTED on medical marijuana. <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, like most members of NORML, I am looking for the removal of all criminal penalties for for the private possession and responsible use of marijuana by adults, including the cultivation for personal use, and the casual nonprofit transfers of small amounts. <br>
NORML additionally supports the development of a legally controlled market for marijuana, where consumers could purchase it from a safe, legal and regulated source. <br>
<br>
As for heroin/cocaine/etc....I think it's less cut &amp; dry. I do not think possession of an amount suitable for personal use should be illegal. Sending smack addicts to prison does nothing except allow them to continue their addiction inside prison walls. <br>
A former friend of mine got arrested for robbery recently (to support his heroin addiction) and chose prison over rehab, because you can still get smack in prison. 'Nuff said.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying heroin et al is good stuff. I've lost several good friends to heroin, and I'm watching one of my best friends slip away because of the shit. He's been in and out of rehab 5 times this past year. Accessibility has never been an issue for him, and he lives in the middle of nowhere in rural Pennsylvania.He's $15,000 in debt because of cash advances on his credit cards to buy heroin.<br>
Now, I can't help but think that if there were some kind of program--a &quot;we'll sell you this much heroin a week, at this price, on the condition that you attend rehab&quot; and wean people off of the shit...something similar to methadone.<br>
The way it is now, the programs they do don't help at all. <br>
My friend with the problem went to a methadone clinic to try and get clean. They drug tested him, said he didn't have enough heroin in his system to qualify for the program. So, he went home and almost overdosed on h <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>so he could get help</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
How fucked is that? I don't have a well mapped system for what should be done with the hard drugs, but what we're doing now is NOT WORKING. The system has GOT to be changed.<br>
More later...<br>

Why are cigarettes legal when they have been proven to do way more damage than pot, but pot is still illegal? Also when is the last time you read about somebody smoking pot and beating up his or her spouse. That happens everyday with alcohol. I think what it comes down to is US is probably making more money having it illegal that if it was legalized.<br>
As far as the hardcore drugs. I don’t know, I think we need to do more than we are doing. I think people in general don’t care about drug users because we consider them scum or less than us. I don’t know if it would help if we legalized the hard stuff or not. I don’t think if we legalized it you would have more junkies I think you would have less. I think a lot of people start because it is illegal and dangerous.<br>

Terrorist attacks are one thing, especially given how illprepared we were for it all (and still are). But few countries have the ability to mass an attack on US soil simply through means of actually GETTING here. Few countries have the long range missils to get here as well. <br>
<br>
As for the war on drugs. I had three really good friends in HS who sold drugs. Heck, they would have given me the shit for free if I had asked. I just didn't want to do them. I didn't do drugs not because I didn't have access (I had plenty of access) but because I did not want to do them. Making them legal wouldn't have gotten me to try them, either. I waited until I was 22 before I started smoking (how dumb can you get <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
My BIL was arrested for having a SINGLE joint on him. One. My ILS spent close to 10K on bail, defense, etc for him. Who knows how much the government spent prosecuting him. I'm sure at least that much. That to me is crazy. He wasn't hurting anyone. He isn't a violent individual. His wife was far more relaxed smoking dope then she is when she's drinking - she can be a real bitch then. <br>
<br>
I have seen people totally waste their lives on drugs. But I've seen them waste their lives on booze. Hell I've even seen it done with sex and religion. People who use something as a crutch will find something to use if its not one thing it will be another.<br>

<br>
But how is this relevant to the war on drugs?<br>
There are not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>more</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> terrorists running around. Hell, the 80's were FULL of terror attacks. Quantity-wise, we're way better off now than we were 20 years ago. <br>
It's just that this time, they had a bigger target. <br>
<br>
And there's no &quot;war on the US&quot;. We're going to war basically for oil.<br>
