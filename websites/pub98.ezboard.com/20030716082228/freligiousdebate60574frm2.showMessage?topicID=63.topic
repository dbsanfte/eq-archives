so haven't checked into too many sites on the inernet, but the question of whether we are hardwired for religion was asked in another thread and I thought it was a great one worthy of a whole new topic! (sorry can't for the life of me remember who's question it was now...)<br>
<br>
Believe it or not there's actually a site called meme central--<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.memecentral.com/">www.memecentral.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and it covers more than just religion if my quick glance is right.<br>
<br>
And for the academic types that enjoy reading journals...<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://jom-emit.cfpm.org/overview.html.">jom-emit.cfpm.org/overview.html.</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> It's a history and overview of memes.<br>
<br>
I can't say I'm a believer in memes just yet as I haven't studied this enough, but it makes sense to me that man would embrace superstition and pass it on to his children believing he is helping them and perhaps not fully understanding how in evolutionary or social terms. These sites seem to be slightly anti-meme but perhaps after reading more they will concede these vestigial structures of the mind were once handy in the more brutish, primitive and unknown world.<br>
<br>
Thoughts?<br>
<br>
ST <p>&quot;I don't have any evidence of that... Just in terms of allocation of time resources, <br>
religion is not very efficient.  There's alot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.&quot; <br>

I haven't read the pages that you posted MamaGadfly.  Too late..I am too tired... but I wonder how much brain research has been done in this field.  <br>
<br>
Question for the brain researchers:  Do the brains of atheists/agnostics differ from the brains of believers?  <br>
<br>
I feel like I am just rambling, but I wonder how much research has been done, and I wonder what any conclusions in this field would do.  <br>

<br>
I know that atheists believe we are all born atheists, but I think we are all born with the light of Christ in us. We were all spirits before we were born, but when we are born, the veil is closed between here and there. I think infants know a lot! Sometimes I think they can't speak because they would spill the beans and tell us everything about heaven! When we have little babies, dh always asks them &quot;Who else is up there waiting to come to our family?&quot; They always look like &quot;I know, but I'm not telling...&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
As we grow, we forget things and sometimes we lose it all together. But, I will never get over how a small child can recognize the face of Jesus, to see His picture and know who it is without being told. I'm sure they remember...  <p>Paige<br>

<br>
From what you had said, I do think perhaps there was a time when it was a biological advantage to believe in God. I certainly believe that the teachings in the OT were more about assuring that the Isrealites survived an flourished. <br>
<br>
It was college where I did start my move away from the Church. And it was the Biology class I took (an overview of evolutionary biology) that got me actually critically looking at the bible, plus it was the first time I had ever been told that Catholics were christians!! And where I met and spent time with others from different world religions and even a couple of athiests. <br>
<br>
But I really could see how the OT was geared to survival as a group. <br>
<br>
As for myself, maybe that is the reason I can not let go of the concept of a deity. I'm too skeptic to accept blindly the concept of the christian God...but I can't let go of there being some type of higher power. <br>

NED - again, I could have written your post!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I usually like proof and evidence..but truely don't feel the need to have any when it comes to religion.  My own feelings and experiences are enough to know that it isn't for me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It's nice to find someone else who feels the same way!!  Normally all the A/A's have spent long years studying many major religions...but aside from the curiosity factor, I don't feel the need - I know that religion doesn't feel right for me.<br>
<br>
It that sense, I definitely think that some people are wired for religion and others aren't.<br>

<br>
Pure speculation on my part, but I have found that many A/As can find that sort of connection without the constructs of a religion - making religion itself unnecessary and actually hampers their ability to do it.<br>

To those of you who've had the experience of a non-believer or child &quot;recognizing&quot; a picture of Jesus, how do you reconcile that with the knowledge that, because of his birthplace and heritage, he would have been dark-skinned, dark-eyed, and wholly semitic in appearance?<br>
