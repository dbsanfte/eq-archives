I have time to write but I don't want to write everything out. Sunday was the day we picked up the Guatemela team form the airport and I ended up riding with Joshua, Jesse and Angie. Me and Jesse sat in the backseat together and I had to tell jesse to put his seatbelt on. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We talked about Lord of the Rings, Signs, and christian music on the way up. Oh and how Joshua is gonna surprise Laura in Texas this December.(Whole 'nother story. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy/biggrina.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) I'm happy for him. Then we got to the airport and for forty five minutes it was a frenzy of greetings, hugs and lots of other stuff!! it was fun. And then Josh and Jesse and me left to take me home. We stopped by a gas station by both our homes for Josh to fix hsi low tire and a lot of stuf happened there that someday I'll write about. And then I directed them towards my hosue and Josh foudn out that I'm a little younger than Jesse and he told me and Jesse he was going to hook me up with Jesse. I was actually not that emberassed. Then Josh told Jesse to stay away form all other girls because I was perfect for Jesse and Jesse said okay. I was kind of emberassed but mostly excited inside my heart. *GG* Life is great right now. I have never felt God so alive in my heart before. Today it's so beautiful outside and listening to Point Of Grace's, &quot;Blue Skies&quot; while it's a beautiful day I felt fulfilled to the overflowing. I start school on the nineteenth and I'm actually not that upset. I mean I've had an amazing summer. Filled with lots of things that I can't even remember all of them. A few more things are still left to experience. Like the Plus One Concert in tne days!! I am soo excited. I really think that is going to be an aweosme experience. Their music is so God-filled and they are such awesome brothers in Christ that I can't wait to experience them live. I will be soo excited if I meet them again. That would be soo awesome!!! <br>
Books-I've been reading Heather's(DaffodillQueen's) amazing story on GLO. She is such an amzing author. She could seriously get it published. I mean it with all of my heart. I LOVE her charectars Harvey and Cameron. Harvey kind of reminds me of Jesse in a more laid back way. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I wish heather would write more but she's starting another story so I can't complain too mcuh. But I soo wish she would continue with Harvey and Cameorn's married life. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/shakehead.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Other Books-<br>
At Home In Mitford-I've read a lot more fo this. I'm on like the eleventh chapter. Mitford sounds like such a cozy and welcoming little town. I wish it was real!! <br>
The Horse and His Boy-Ughh I need to read more of this tonight. Enough said......<br>
The Two Towers-I'm reading this again with my little sis. We're on The White Rider now. She's enjoying it but sometimes the Old English way of speaking gets a little boring for her but I still love it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Song of the Day-<br>
Blue Skies<br>
Point of Grace<br>
On days of gray<br>
When doubt clouds my view<br>
It's so hard to see past my fears<br>
My strength seems to fade<br>
And it's all I can do<br>
To hold on, 'til the light reappears<br>
Still, I believe though some rain's bound to fall<br>
That you're here next to me<br>
And your're over it all<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
Lord, the sky's still blue<br>
For my hope is in you<br>
You're my joy<br>
You're the dream that's still alive<br>
Like the wind at my back<br>
And the sun on my face<br>
You are life<br>
You're grace<br>
You are blue skies<br>
You're my blue skies<br>
When nights are long<br>
Seems the dark has no end <br>
Still we walk on in light of the truth<br>
For waiting beyond <br>
Where the morning begins<br>
Is the dawn, and you're mercy anew<br>
Oh, to believe we're alive in you're love<br>
There is so much to see<br>
If we keep looking up <br>
<br>
(Repeat Chorus)<br>
<br>
You fill the heavens with hope and a higher love<br>
A picture, a promise for life<br>
<br>
Repeat chorus <br>
<br>
I LOVE this song. It is soo true and it always reminds me that when dyas are hard and my hope dissapears, Jesus is still my Blue Skies and my hope. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It's just plain beautiful. I LOVE it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's the kidn fo day that makes you start thinkign about falling in love and finding your Prince Charming or thinking about someone you think might be your Prince Charming. * Dreamy Sigh*....  I'm such a hopeless romantic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But it also makes you think about the ultimate romance with God and that's more importent right now to me and it always will be. I want to find this one verse and I think it's in Psalms but I'm not completely sure. It's something about how God's mercies are new every morning. It's really bugging me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I talked to Kim a while ago. She's soo sweet, she just called to see how my week was going. I told her about the whole airport adventure. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  She was laughing at everything. I love having her as a support in this whole *boy* thing. She gives such good advice and she's wise beyond her years. She knows everythign I'm going through or at least a lot of it. I can't wait to see her Saturday at the flaot trip. I'm a little apprehensive about it. I DO NOT  want to get tipped over and find myself in the water next to a snake.! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/shakehead.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But I don't mind getting tipped over by boys as logn as theres no snakes but I can't count on that. But I will be getting whoever tips me back. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
Books-I still need to read more Narnia chapters. Ughh... I need to get disiplined with this book. I DO like it, it's just I've been so busy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Mitford Series-I've gotten a little farther. Like I said above I've been really busy lately. <br>
The Two towers-I read almost a whole chapter to Ellie today. Gandalf has returned!! She likes but nto as much as me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Song of The Day-<br>
Yes I Believe<br>
Point of Grace<br>
When I said that I would follow<br>
It was with an honest heart<br>
But I didn't fully understand the cost<br>
'Cause there are saints throughout the ages<br>
And there are those today<br>
Who show us what it really means to carry the cross<br>
That only fuels my devotion<br>
No matter what comes I will say<br>
<br>
(Chorus) <br>
Yes, I believe<br>
I believe with all that is in me <br>
Yes, I believe<br>
Though the world rises up against me<br>
I will be faithful<br>
To the choice I have made<br>
I am determined <br>
I will not be ashamed<br>
To live so the whole world can see<br>
That yes, I believe <br>
<br>
There will never be a reason<br>
To lose this confidence<br>
For I have found where my assurance lies<br>
It is not in my own power<br>
But in who my savior is<br>
And the truth of this conviction<br>
Makes me shout to the sky<br>
<br>
(Repeat Chorus)<br>
<br>
Yes, I believe he is risen<br>
Yes, I believe we are forgiven<br>
Yes, I believe and one day we'll see him<br>
And together we'll say <br>
<br>
(Repeat Chorus)<br>
<br>
I LOVE this song. It's so beautiful instrimentally and I LOVE the words. They're really powerful. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't think I'll have time to write all this but let me just say that the Plus One concert last Saturday was AMAZING!!!!! Jason looked adoarable!!! I took like ten pictures of just him and then like twenty of the group. They sang for a hour and fifteen minutes and they sang all of their best songs. Let me see if I can list them all......\<br>
  Camoflauge<br>
  I Don't Care!!(I LOVE this song)<br>
  Kick Me<br>
  Under The Influence<br>
  Forever<br>
  Last Fight Out<br>
  Soul Tattoo<br>
  The Promise<br>
  Start to Fly(This song was AWESOME in concert!!)<br>
  Written on My Heart<br>
  Going Crazy!!!(At the last part where Jason sings his solo they all stopped and the music stopped and Nate said, &quot;Oh let's just stop.&quot; But then suddenly the music came back with a boom and Jason sang his solo. it was soo cool. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
  <br>
  Let's see what has been going on with Jesse and ZAP..... Hmmmm.... I went to the Float Trip almost two Saturday's ago and it was AWESOME. I only got tipped over once,(Jacob did it to me.) I didn't see any snakes(Thank the Lord!) and the water felt awesome and was never that deep. it was very fun. I was sore though from Jacob flipping me over on my butt. Ouch! Well then anyway that night instead of going home I spent the night at Becky's house and went to Victory for church services the next morning. I went to children's church to help out with all the teen's. When I walked in jesse said, &quot;It's Amie!&quot; and then he immediatly said, &quot;Hey Amie, I heard your neighbor's house got TPied on accident!&quot; (Now at this point I still thought that Jesse and his brothers had done it although Jacob and Johnathen denied it.)  So that was a little suspicious for him to say that. Then Becky accused Jesse of doing it and he said, &quot;I didn't do it!&quot; He protested over and over and then his little brother Jerimiah said, &quot;Yeah Jesse didn't do it!&quot; But then he burst into laughter and Jesse hit him and said with his face turning red, &quot;Shut up Jerimiah!&quot; It was soo funny so I obviously still thought he had done it. We made up a skit for the kids and me and Jesse interacted talkign in it. It was kind of emberassing though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Then we went to worship and worship was AWESOME!!!! Then we went to children's church where we did our own little worship and then the skit and then a little teaching and more worship. It was fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Then after church everyone was trying to figure out what we wnated to do afterwards and it took su liek a hour to figure out where to go!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But I ended up going with Kim(my small group leader) to Cheryl's house with a group of guys and girls. The guys were Mikey, Micah, Robert, Jacob and Johnathen. So yeah I knew it was probably going to be intresting. We went to her hosue and we ate lunch and then we watched lord of The Rings!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   it was soo funny 'cause Jacob has read the books liek four times so he was doing all these fighting motions and making all these gross faces when the orcs were on. He's soo weird. But then he would be talkign and then he would say,&quot;Shut up guys, this is my favorite part!&quot; And we weren't talking at all. Guys. Sheesh. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Then we had to stop at the most exciting fighting scene at the end because we had to go to prayer meeting before ZAP at Victory. So we left and we got there and me, Elise, Rachael and Anna decided not to go to prayer meeting and so we were just talking and we didn't know that Jesse and his friends were already here but we DID notice that their bikes were hidden behind some bushes. So we said, &quot;They would freak if we his those bikes somewhere else!&quot; So we snuck outside and we their pretty expensive mountain bikes in this little alclove where they wouldn't think to look. We then were dying laughing and soo proud of ourselves. Then we headed toward the back parkign lot to go to the playground. I got out first and I said, &quot;Guys, someone TPied someone's car really good.&quot; They all rushed out and said that it was Cathy's car. (Cathy watched Lord of the Rings with us earlier and she's the kind of girl taht at least to me it seemed she might get upset over a joke like that.) So anyway we decided we were going to clean it up. So we went to the car and they had doen a very good job. We knew immdiatly it was Jesse and his friends. they had stuck paper cups, parer forks and straws in the cracks in the car and windows and strewn tp everywhere. it was bad and we had gotten everything almost cleaned up when suddenly the door form the cafeteria behind us slams open and Jesse runs out yelling, &quot;Mind your own freakin buisness!&quot; (I can't believe he said that even though it's not a bad word.) Well we all burst into laughter because we had ruined their joke and we ran back to where we had his their bikes and we threw the toilet paper all ver the bikes!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It was soo awesome!! We came back out and noticed that one of Jesse's best friends,(Kenan) had been watching us. So we went back inside and we thought everything was over and then me and Angie(She had just arrived.) noticed that the guys had snuck back outside and they were going to our little hiding spot with jesse yelling the whole way down. So meand Angie snuck out and we followed them and they were cleaning up the TP. Suddenly Jesse whirls around because he heard us and we jumped up and said, &quot;Hi Jesse!&quot; In these cheesy voices. Then we went back inside and went out the back door to follow them and there they were TPing the car again!! Now Angie was mad so I followed her out and they had a little heated discussion for ten minutes. I said, &quot;If you cna do this soo effiently then I knwo you did my house.&quot; Then Jesse said, &quot;For the millionth time I did not do that! I wouldn't have gotten the wrong house 'cause I know which house you live in! Besides your hosue has a jungle in front!&quot; (Now my dad did all that beautiful gardening so I laughed at that.) Then Jesse said, &quot;If you care this much about this car then go get Cathy and once she sees what we did then you can clean it up!&quot; Now we totally rejected this idea... So anyway we said a few more things and then we went inside. Then ten minutes later we see Jesse talking  Ikaiko(one of his friends) and then we see Ikaiko coming towards me and Elise. Now he opens the water bottle he has in his hand and he says &quot;Hi Elise!&quot; And then tries to spill the water bottle on her!! Elise dodges it and it spilled all over the floor. Then all the boys retreat to the little boys room and we run to tell Kim(See Jesse and his friends have this war going on between them. I haveNO idea why though.) So we tell Kim and she had been so excited earlier about our joke and then now she was ticked though. She said, &quot;Where are they?&quot; She was soo mad. We told her they were in the boy's bathroom and she says, &quot;I'm GOING IN!&quot; And she starts marching towards the bathroom door and then Jacob stopped her by grabbing her arm and said, &quot;Kim I'm NOT letting you go into the bathroom!&quot; So Jacob wouldn't let her get in. So meand Elise saw our opportunity. While they were practically hiding in the bathroom me and Elise snuck out and cleaned the the TP again ending the joke by throwing it away once and for all. Amd the boys didn't even know it till ZAP started. But anyway after that we called a truce inside Victory and I shook Jesse's hand and he held it a little longer then neccessary, I think. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Then I said, &quot;We may ahve called a truce but if you or any of your friends ever come near me with a water bottle I will be very mad.&quot; Then Jesse said, &quot;I promise that none of my friends or me will come near you with a water bottle.&quot; Then I we started talking about the trick or something and Kenan said,&quot; You know I think they're right. We were the one's that tpid her car.&quot; (Now Jesse thinks he 's sooo smooth in his manuevers .) Then Jesse said, &quot;Kenan you know it's not about Cathy, she's Kim's friend and that's why we did it!&quot; Then his afce turned really red and he was like, &quot;I didn't just say that.&quot; We were all like, &quot;Smooth, jesse, smooth.&quot; Well then anyway the night before Becky had told me she would do somethign to emberass Jesse if he really had tpied my house. I didn't know how she would do it but I found out when ZAP started. So Becky  and Audrey get up on stage for ZAP announcements. Becky says, &quot;We have only two announcements tonight and Cathy is going to tell out first one.&quot; Now Cathy comes up with a baseball cap full of something. Jesse and the boys were sitting right behind me. Anyway she pulls all the remains of the toilet paprer me and Elise hadn't been able to get out of the cap. And she says, &quot;Some people tried to Tp my car but I have friends in high places and they didn't succeed.&quot; Then she coughed and said, &quot;I don't knwo who did it though.&quot; And I pointed with my forefinger over Jesse's head because he was sitting right behind me and he grabbed my arm and wouldn't let go of it. He said, &quot;Shut up Amie.&quot; And he was holding really tight on my arm. It hurt actually. Then he let go. Well then Becky came back up on stage and she put a hand on her hip and said, &quot;Hmmmmm...... I WONDER if it's the same people who tried to TP Amie's house but they got her neighbor's!!!!&quot; Everybody was dying laughign and Jesse's face was bright red. &quot;I didn't do that.&quot; He said over and over. Then Becky said, &quot;Nice try guys but you didn't succeed either time!' Then the announcements were over. Jacob whispered behind m and he said to me, &quot;Amie I promise we didn't do it!&quot;  And then I said, &quot;I believe you.&quot; And I truly did mean it. So anyway we had worship and then small group and the sermon and it was all good. Jesse left thirty minute before ZAP ended and I didn't know why. I started feeling kidn of bad that we ruined their joke. So anway after ZAP I found out that Josh knows who did and so does Kenan but they didn't do it and they won't tell me who did. So anyway I was talkign to Josh and jacob and Jacob said, &quot;Really we didn't do it!&quot; And I said, &quot;I told you, I believe you!&quot; The Josh said, &quot;There's doubt in your eyes, Amie!&quot; The I laughed. Then Jacob said, 'What color eyes do you have? I'm a eye person. I have to know what coloor eyes you ahve.&quot; I was a little confused and he siad to coem over in the light and he got up in my face and then he leaned back and said, &quot;They're green but almost blue.&quot; Well anyway that was pretty mcuh what happened that night and the next set of events was the next Wednesday whe we had the Teen Leader party and Becky's house for Kids of Victory. It was really fun and I'll write about it later. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/umytodd1126.showPublicProfile?language=EN>myTodd1126</A> at: 8/21/02 9:52:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/umytodd1126.showPublicProfile?language=EN>myTodd1126</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CLBL Regular <BR> Cool unique title coming!</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#3333ff>(8/21/02 2:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Amie's Journal!!</span><hr size=1> Wow..

A lot has happened and I honestly don't feel like saying all of it. I'll give a summary. Two days after Jesse called me, me and him said face to face that we both liked eachother. Every since then it's been a whirlwind of twists and turns, heartache and happiness. Last night God turned my world upside down and not the way I wanted Him to. Now I see that He's just doing some housecleaning. He is now the most importent thing in my life. I will never forsake Him for a guy again. I jsut pray that this sticky situation will resolve itself and me and Jesse can go on with our lives and continue where we left off. Getting to know wachother and being friends for now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But never again will I put Gid down lower on my priority list. I'm going to read my Bible every day and have a quiet time almost every day. It's helping me grow spiritually. I'm just soo glad God can forgive and make any mistake into something wonderful. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
  Here's my new life verse and life bok of the bible *for* me. <br>
   Jeremiah 29:11 &quot;For I knwo the plans I have for you. plans to prospor you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.&quot;<br>
  And then my new book of the bible that's my special book is Song Of Solomen.<br>
  <br>
  My new song.......<br>
   Point of Grace<br>
   Begin With ME<br>
Lord I know sometimes you look down and shake Your head<br>
When we know what we should do and do the other thing instead<br>
We're living in glass houses and we're throwing sticks and stones<br>
The love that will come to us is the love that we have shown<br>
<br>
Ignite a fire in my spirit<br>
And when I want to make a difference<br>
This will be my prayer<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
Begin with me<br>
Turn my world upside down<br>
Come change my heart around<br>
Lord keep on washing me clean<br>
Begin with me<br>
Come and renew my mind<br>
And lead me to the light<br>
'Til I am more like You Jesus<br>
Begin, begin with me<br>
<br>
Have you ever noticed how we love to give advice<br>
We offer up suggestions without thinking twice<br>
Got 20/20 vision when we're watching someone else<br>
But it's a little blurry when we're looking at ourselves<br>
<br>
I can't forget to check the mirror<br>
That's where I find the only one<br>
That He wants me to change<br>
<br>
(Repeat Chorus)<br>
<br>
Starting right here, right now<br>
Lord I surrender to You<br>
Ready to serve <br>
Ready to love<br>
'Cause that is all that matters in the end<br>
<br>
(Repeat Chorus) <br>

God hit me with something powerful!</span><hr size=1> Last night was probably the best night of my life. Well besides when I asked Jesus into my heart. Last night at youth group I got The Babtism of The Holy Spirit and I spoke in tounges for the first time. There was this big teaching on it before ZAP in another class called Christianity 101 and after the teaching we all got in a circle and two of the adults were praying for us and the one guy said, &quot;Okay we're going to pray for you to recieve the Babtism of The Holy Spirit and when I say in Jesus' Name, you're going to have it because it's a promise of God from the Bible. So he prayed and when he said In Jesus' Name, I felt something rush through me. I truly did. Then he said, &quot;You guys all have it. If you want to be prayed for to recieve the gift of tounges so you can use it, we'll pray for you. I had my friend Jennie who's sixteen pray with me, 'cause she already had it before that day. We just held hands and Jennie said that the easiest way to start out is just to praise God's name and say stuff like that. I tried and it seriously took me five minytes of doing that, I started to believe that I didn't have it and that I wasn't going to get it. After the five minutes, I had like three people praying for me. It was mostly my friends who had recieved it and wanted to pray for me. The second I started thinking, &quot;Oh it's not going to happen.&quot; I suddenly just heard this tumble of words start to rush form my mouth. At first I didn't know that was it and I was doing it but then Jennie whispered to me, &quot;Do you hear that? You have it! That's your own personaly prayer language to God.&quot; I felt soo different. It was absolutely amazing. I went out of there practically anew person in God. jennie was soo on fire now that that had happened to all us younger girls. I went to Kim who was coming out of the bathroom before ZAP started and I said, &quot;Well i went into the teaching.&quot; and she said, &quot;Oh you did? as it good?&quot; and I nodded and then I smiled and I was about to burst out crying and I said, &quot;I got it.&quot; Kim just looked at me for a second of pure joy and then she screamed and pulled me into the tightest hug and she was practically crying and she was saying stuff like, &quot;Praise God!&quot; and all this stuff and she said, &quot;Yes! I have been waiting for somethign like this to happen all week! This made my week!&quot; Then I told her that all of us girls and even a guy had gotten it in the class and she screamed again. We went into the ZAP room and before ZAP started Kim asked us if she minded if she told everybody in ZAP what had happened in the middle of worship. Then her and Jennie kind of reinforced what the teaching had said by telling us that we really needed to practice doing tounges now so we can use and get more comfertable in it. And to especially read the Bible a lot and get in God's word. We didn't mind her telling ZAP so in the middle she told the story and Megan(my friend) went up on stage and told her story. Everybdy was screaming and clapping and soo happy for us. Then Kim gave everybody a chance that had not done it before to come up and do it and the people who had recieved it earlier were supposed to pray for whoever went up. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Jesse kind of looking at me in surprise. I think he thought it was cool.  So anyway after a few minutes and nobody was coming up, one of the guys on the worship team came up and said to people who even had already had it happen to them to coem up because they might need it. So then practically all of ZAP went up. Jesse was praying for a few guys. I prayed for a few girls. It was totally awesome! Then in small group, it was Elise's birthday,(one of my friends) and she had lost her tounges a while back so we prayed over her and she got it back! It was soo amazing. The same thing happened after the main teaching of the night. Us people that had gotten it in Christianity 101 went up and prayed for girls while guys prayed or guys. It was amazing. One of the worship songs we sangf that night really touched me too especially after what had just happened to me. It went like this.......<br>
We declare this place<br>
covered with your glory<br>
we declare this house <br>
a shelter to the needy<br>
we will say aloud<br>
that we are not ashamed<br>
no, we'll proclaim your name <br>
until your kingdom comes<br>
Chorus<br>
Come, Lord, come<br>
with fire consume our praises<br>
delight in our dance<br>
our strong tower, Holy are You<br>
<br>
Anyway..... Sorry for rambling. I hope I haven't offended anyone, if you don't like tounges and all that..  I hope I didn't offen you! I just had to share this experience with you all.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/ulaughinglauraj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>laughinglauraj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CLBL Newbie ~ Welcome!</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#3333ff>(9/30/02 4:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WOW!!!

God hit me with something powerful!</span><hr size=1> Hey journal!!! A lot has been going on with school, dance, my friends at ZAp and *you know who*. I really don't want to type out everything but God has really been showing up in my quiet times which is awesome. I've been getting into The Word a lot more. He always shows up when I do that. Things with *you know who* are great!!! I still can't believe all thsi has happened. I feel soo special and lucky. We've talked five times on the phone this week and I'm seeing him tomorrow. I saw him yesterday too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Books-I've been doing a lot of school reading and the books have been pretty good. Especially Mara-Daughter of The Nile which was my first school book. On the side I had been re-reading a lot of Clearwater Crossing books but then I decided to re-read the Lord of The Rings books. I'm almost to the middle fo The Fellowship fo The Ring. It's been fun re-reading them. <br>
Oh guess what??? Joy Williams came out with her sophmore cd!! It is soo amazing. I'm going to put all the songs at the end of my journal posts until I've typed all the songs. Today I'm going to put down this song that's really inspired me with my realtionships with my ZAP friends, my family and *you know who* Especially him. Oh and it even applies to God! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  Every Moment<br>
  Joy Williams<br>
We laughed out loud 'til we cried and the tears were sweet. Midnight melted to morning, a moment faded to memory... All these days just slip away through our fingers, so.....<br>
 Chorus<br>
Don't let go. Hold on to every moment. Always know, hold on to every moment that you can. <br>
<br>
We move on with no regrets to our destiny.. Held by the hands of The Father. We share his love and he leads us through all these days 'cause they slip away from our fingers. So....<br>
<br>
 Chorus<br>
Don't let go. Hold on to every moment. Always know, hold on to every moment that you can.<br>
<br>
Runnign through yesterday into tomorrow. Don't let it just drift away.. Forget about tying the hands of time, give every moment to the One who's given today.....<br>
<br>
 Chorus<br>
Don't let go. Hold on to every moment. Always know, hold on to every moment that you can...<br>
<br>
Forever,<br>
