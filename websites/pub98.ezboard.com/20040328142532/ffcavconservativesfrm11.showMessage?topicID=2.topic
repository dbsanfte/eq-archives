There is more than name calling going on these days. There seems to be a deep, palpable hatred of the “other side”. It doesn’t matter if you are left, right or middle, you can feel it being directed at you from someone. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is not exclusive to left against right or right against left. There is a visible distain between members of the same party. Dean goes after Clark. Clark goes after Kerry. They call each other unfit for the job. Joe Lieberman, the darling of the Democrat party just three years ago, is now called a Republican in disguise. The slogan “Dr. Dean: Doctor assisted suicide for the Democrat party” is making the rounds from the Hillary camp. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hate in politics is nothing new. History says that Julius Caesar’s last words were, “You too, Brutus?” His dying vision was his friend burying a knife in his back.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Campaigns can be rough places. If there is an incumbent, as in this election cycle, they not only attack each other but the incumbent. This year the battle cry is “I hate Bush the most.” <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
While election years are always interesting this particular one seem more vicious than most and it’s still early. Claims of campaign violations; charges that campaign workers from out of state will try and vote; videos from years ago surfacing to embarrass; the chance path crossing of one with some white supremacist group decades ago is being drug front and center. Private letters written years ago mysteriously surface. Men who are not used to having their words questioned are getting angry and candidates are shouting at people in the crowd when asked to tone down the hate speech. It’s getting ugly out there. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There is intrigue. Are the Clinton’s working behind the scenes for Wesley Clark? Are they fighting to get the General the nomination only to cut him off at the knees, to ensure that he will loose, thus keeping the path to the White House clear for Hillary in 2008? Bill is calling contributors; odd things are being leaked about Dean. Will the same leaky source remain active only this time against Clark should he get the nomination? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hate is encouraged by the head of the DNC, Terry McAuliffe, who perpetuates the lie about the Florida election results stating Bush is an illegitimate President. He and his party know better. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a new element thrown into the mix. The Internet is alive with political sites. One site that has gotten a lot of attention of late is MoveOn.org. This is the radical left-wing site that has received millions from George Soros whose only goal in life is to single handedly alter the American political system by buying the White House for the Democrats. He makes no excuses for himself. That’s what he wants and he says he is willing to pay whatever it takes. Millionaires have tried this before and the American people seem to take a general dim view of the practice. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Al Gore endorsed Dean. This was a slap in the face to his own running mate, Joe Lieberman as well as the Clinton’s who are quietly backing Clark and have a strong dislike of Dr. Dean. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Have past elections had the obvious outpouring of hatred? The left says that since the right coined the names “feminazi” and “Hitlary” it’s justified to call the President Hitler. However, with little searching, one can find pictures of Reagan in an SS uniform sporting a Hitler mustache. There were also comparisons between Clinton and Hitler. So the comparison of a President of the United States to Hitler didn’t start with Bush. It is interesting to point out that both Republican and Democrat Presidents, with diverse agenda’s, have been compared to Hitler. Somehow, we have managed to survive both. Hitler lives on through his legacy of hate. I can’t think of a better mascot for hate.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Many on the left say all this hate started with the perceived persecution of Bill Clinton. This is naive. Politics has always been down and dirty. The difference seems to be that it has spread from cigar wielding participants in smoke filled back rooms to the general population. It’s grown like a cancer and if not reined in could spell the death of the American political system. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Any fool with a photo program can make offensive pictures. Conspiracy theories abound and are foolishly repeated by Presidential candidates. This hate, of course, is only seen as hate when it comes from the “other” side. They themselves don’t hate, only the “other” side hates. Their side is honest, clever and enlightened. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have to wonder if there is any connection between the steady decline in the number of people who no longer care who the President is and all the hate that permeates the political scene these days. It’s frightening when adults are shown pictures of the Vice President and are clueless, but can quickly identify Ben Affleck. Over 50% of the voting population just doesn’t seem to care.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As the people of Iraq slowly realize they will be able to vote for the person of their choice instead of a brutal dictator, we in America seem to be dying a slow, self inflicted death from terminal apathy, uncontrollable rage and blind hatred.<br>
