<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once there was a large group of mice that lived in a closet in a huge, rich mansion. The closet was big, especially to the mice. There was one light in the ceiling and it was only turned on when someone in the mansion needed something from the closet. Otherwise, the only light came from under the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The closet was connected to a servant's bedroom and the bedroom was connected to the main kitchen. This servant was the main assistant to the chef. He loved cats and had a big gray one that was very aware of the mice that lived in the closet. Some mice had tried to get to the kitchen but were killed and eaten by the fearsome cat.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once a week the servant would take the gray cat and visit his mother in the next town and stay overnight. When the servant was away the mice would venture out to the kitchen and grab whatever meager crumbs of food and water that could be found and take it back to the closet for the week.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A set of double doors opened into a very immense dining room from the kitchen. These doors were usually closed. One day when the servant and his cat were away the mice noticed the doors to the dining hall were slightly ajar. The mice had no idea what was on the other side and were too afraid to peek in and see. They thought there may be more cats and felt safe where they were.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly, through the doorway walked another mouse. This mouse was not one of the other mice but joined them in the closet anyway. The mouse told the other mice about the dining room.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;In the dining room,&quot; began the strange mouse, &quot;are many chairs around a huge table that is almost as large as the room. At the end of the table away from the double doors is a very beautiful chair. The chair is covered with gold and silver and inlaid with many jewels of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires. In the chair sits a man dressed in fine clothes of a rich king. Many servants are around him, serving him an array of assorted foods and drinks that no man or mouse has seen at one time. But the other chairs are empty, so the king wishes that you would join him at a great feast in his honor.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;But we are mice and not men,&quot; said the leader of the mice, &quot;and besides, we could never go in there. That hideous cat will kill us all.&quot; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The king has sent me to save you from the cat.&quot; exclaimed the mouse, whose eyes flashed blue when he spoke of the king.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You?&quot; laughed the leader and his closest friends. &quot;And just who do you think you are?&quot; asked one of the leader's friends.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I am the king's closest servant and friend.&quot; said the mouse, whose eyes flashed again. &quot;Please come with me and I will kill the cat and you can join the king at his table for the feast in the dining hall.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What you say is ridiculous!&quot; cried the leader and scurried away to his corner of the closet, followed by his friends and most of the other mice. But some of the mice began to ask the king's servant questions. &quot;Can you really kill the cat? Is the king nice? What kind of food is on the table? The mouse answered them all except how he would kill the cat. &quot;When I kill the cat, you must go to the door of the dining room and shout my name which is Mesha. The doors will spring open wide and you can go in to see the king.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next day at dawn, the strange mouse left the closet and went into the bedroom to wait for the cat. Many of the mice cautiously found safe places to watch and see if the mouse would really do as he said. Soon the servant arrived and let the cat into the bedroom. The big cat immediately knew that something was different. He sniffed around and then spotted the bold little mouse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;These mice are to dine with the king and you are not going to stop them,&quot; said the mouse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, I'm surprised you are not afraid of me,&quot; replied the cat. &quot;The other mice are scared to death. You must not belong to their group. Nevertheless, prepare to die!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Whether I live or die, you will die for sure today.&quot; exclaimed the mouse passionately, his eyes flashing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The great cat drew back alarmed at the bold mouse, but only for a brief moment. Suddenly, he pounced upon the mouse. Around and around the floor they went. There was a great flurry for several minutes. Then it stopped. Lying in the middle of the room was the cat, dead, with the brave mouse's teeth sunk into its neck. The mouse's tail twitched several times and then was still. After a long pause the boldest of the mice crept up to the battle site and saw that the mouse was dead also. Several of the mice gently took the mouse's body into the closet and covered it with a piece of purple velvet found in the servant's rag bag. They placed the body in a corner and then began to ponder what had happened.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When the servant found his cat on the floor dead, he grieved. He took the body outside the mansion and buried it in the woods.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the cat gone the mice soon discovered they could go to the kitchen and take more time finding the choicest scraps left under the tables and in the pantries. The leader of the mice called for a day of celebration to honor the strange mouse and to rejoice for their new found freedom.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One day much later two mice,  who had helped with the burial ceremony, were scurrying by the great double doors when one stopped and looked up at them. &quot;Friend,&quot; he called out to his companion, &quot;do you remember what the strange mouse said about these doors?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;He said that the king has invited us to the feast and to go through the doors we have to say the mouse's name. The strange mouse claimed to be the king's servant.&quot; said the second mouse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;And what was the mouse's name?&quot; asked the first mouse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a long pause. &quot;Mesha, yes, Mesha was his name,&quot; said the second mouse, thoughtfully.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Should we go in?&quot; asked the first mouse. He was trembling with anticipation.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The second mouse turned toward the doors. &quot;Mesha!&quot; he shouted. After a very quiet moment, the doors suddenly sprang open!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before them was the longest table they had ever seen. It had every kind of food imaginable on it. It was just as the king's servant had said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Come in! Come over here and sit by me!&quot; boomed a powerful voice from the other end of the table. It was the king and on his right side sat a man. &quot;There is something very familiar about him,&quot; thought the mice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You have come!&quot; exclaimed the man. &quot;You have finally come to dine with the king!&quot; His eyes flashed blue as he spoke. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The mice looked at each other. But they were amazed to find that they were no longer mice but men! The king's servant walked up to them and took each one's arm. &quot;I'm glad you are here. Come meet the king,&quot; he said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They walked to the king. &quot;Welcome!&quot; said the king. &quot;Join me at this feast I have prepared for you.&quot; And they all ate and drank and talked and laughed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But the other mice... what of them? Well, they are free - and welcome to dine with the king, if they will just say the word. But until then, I'm afraid they will just have to settle for the scraps of the kitchen.<br>
