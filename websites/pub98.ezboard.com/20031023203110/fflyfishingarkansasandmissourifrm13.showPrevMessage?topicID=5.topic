When is the EXACT moment to pull on the line (and how much), to gain line speed for distance? and when is the EXACT moment to feed the line back?<br>

<br>
The hauls are something that you will learn to &quot;feel&quot;. You are pulling line as the rod loads. At the last instant there is a brief acceleration in your haul as you stop the rod.  Here are a few tips that might help you get started.<br>
<br>
1. Most of the people that I have worked with on their haul do not carry enough line speed in the back cast to allow the line to tighten. Be aggressive with your back cast. Eventually you will begin to feel the proper timing.<br>
<br>
2. Your hand should follow the line in your back cast. When I am shooting line I follow it with my hand. I can feel the line running through my fingers. I &quot;gently&quot; slow the line down with tension from my hand until I finally stop the line. <br>
<br>
3. At the point that you stop the line in your back cast your hand should be at the farthest position back as you can &quot;comfortably&quot; get it. This will give you additional stroke length to start your forward cast. You DO NOT want to have so much movement in your haul that it destroys your casting form. A long hauling drift can kill the straight line path of the rod tip and thus make for poor loops.<br>
<br>
4. As you load the rod on the forward cast you should feel the rod begin to load. If you have slack in your back cast your haul will feel as though it has nothing to pull against. As the pressure and speed increase on the rod tip prior to the stop, I make a hard &quot;follow through&quot; of a &quot;flick&quot; with my hauling hand. It feels like I am &quot;throwing&quot; the line to my side.<br>
<br>
I have a short video of me practicing my haul that I can email you. I was experiencing some casting faults with my loops so I video taped what was going on. If you'd like I can email you that video short.<br>

<br>
John gives some excellent advice.  Here are some other tidbits to consider.<br>
<br>
1.  The character of the haul (when it starts and stops, how the line hand moves) should precisely mirror what your rod hand is doing.  The haul should be a gradual acceleration to a stop, just like you stroke the rod.  So it's really pretty easy to get the timing right, just have your hands moving at the same time and with the same cadence.  On the backcast, your hands will be moving in opposite directions.  On the forecast, your hands will both be moving forward at first, then the line hand will break away and move down at your side.<br>
<br>
2.  The line will tell you when to feed the haul back.  In fact, giving the haul back after the stop is very much like shooting line.  The momentum of the loop moving forward causes tension on the bottom leg, which pulls the line back out of the rod.  As John mentions, you can shoot line and &quot;give back&quot; your haul at the same time, but that's more advanced.  For now, just work on gripping the line solid and don't try to mix in a shoot.<br>
<br>
3.  As you've probably heard, Mel K. invented a word called &quot;downup&quot;.  This is meant to imply that you don't spend very much time at the bottom of your haul motion.  You go down, you come up.  Maybe I should clarify --  you go down during the casting stroke, you come up after the stop is made and the loop has well-escaped the rod tip.<br>
<br>
4.  Lefty Kreh says that the rod is basically used to form a proper loop.  The haul is used to generate whatever line speed is necessary for the application.  So he maintains that (in general), your casting stroke should be relatively constant and your haul defines speed.  In his words, &quot;This is the steering wheel (holding out the rod), and this is the gear shift (holding out the line hand)&quot;.<br>
<br>
5.  Further to Lefty's comments above, I would like to add that a poorly executed haul can destroy what would otherwise have been a beautiful loop.  I've had students that have worked for years on fixing a tailing loop problem before we met up.  First thing I do is ask them to cast with one hand (no hauling) at 45 feet.  If the problem is power application (rod), it will still be present.  On the occasional student, the tail goes away and I can easily see that they are taking a vicious haul (which in turn overloads the rod into a concave path of the tip).  Make your hauls very gentle at first, until you get the rhythm and feel.  Work up from there.<br>
<br>
6.  The best exercise I know to engrain the proper muscle memory for hauling is to make &quot;single-direction&quot; sidearm casts, letting each one fall to the ground.  At first, don't even haul.  Just make a proper stroke and get your loop as perfect as you can.  First backcast with the rod horizontal, and let it fall.  Think about what you just did and saw.  Then forecast and let it fall.  This will let you come up with cause/effect relationships.    <br>
<br>
When you are happy with what you have, make that same backcast, but give a little tug with your line hand.  Don't even worry about giving it back at first.  Just see what it does to your line speed, and also see if it affects the shape of your loop.  Hopefully if you accelerate it gradually enough, you won't hurt the loop.  Doing it slowly like this, one direction at a time, allows you to stop and think about what's going on.  It's very methodical, and I've never seen any method work better.  Once you come to trust the haul on the ground like this, then you can gradually move it from sidearm, to 3/4 angle, to overhead. <br>
<br>
Once you have used a haul for a year or two, you will use it all the time.  It will get to the point where it feels awkward when you don't haul.  There is a side benefit to hauling that not many people talk about.  Hauling can help you maintain a reasonably snug line prior to loading the rod.  You know how you would like to remove almost all of the slack out of the line before you pick up into your backcast?  Because once it all comes tight, it shocks the rod and line, dispersing energy everywhere but where you need it?  Same thing once the line is in the air.  Any slack will reduce our gracefulness, sudden jarring impacts are not conducive to smooth flowing loops.  You can think of the early part of the haul as a sort of &quot;pre-load&quot; effort, without wasting any of your casting stroke with the rod. <br>
<br>
I can't imagine a casting world without a haul....<br>

<br>
I've watched you cast and you are no doubt a VERY talented caster!!  It is a thing of beauty.  <br>
<br>
I've been thinking about hauling and why one would want to learn the technique.  It occurs to me that for the vast majority of the time when trout fishing on the White the target will be within a distance that makes hauling unnecessary.  Am I correct in that assumption?  You are my expert and I'll defer to what ever you say.  At your class I was not hauling and didn't have any difficulty throwing line 50'.  After you got my tempo settled down it was almost effortless, in fact.  Aren't most trout going to be closer than 50'?  If so, then it stands to reason that under most circumstances hauling just isn't necessary.  It's overkill.  Kinda like using a 30-06 on squirrels when a 22 will do the job.  My thought is go with what makes sense and conserving energy makes sense when on an all day trout FF trip.<br>
<br>
On the other hand it also occurs to me that when the wind is blowing in your face and you're trying to throw that Double Bunny at a 40&quot; Brown 50' away then additional line acceleration over and above what the action of the rod/line/leader/tippet/fly can provide on its own would be desirable and maybe even a necessity.  (Sorry for the complex sentence.)  The name of the game has to be to do what is necessary to get the line where it needs to go.  <br>
<br>
I'm beginning to think your handle, &quot;Haulaholic&quot;, is perfect for you.  I think hauling is just something you've really enjoyed all these years and it has ultimately become a natural part of your rhythm as a caster.  You say you can't imagine casting without hauling.  Your own admission speaks pretty clearly.  My next question, which seems logical to me, is are you dependent upon hauling to be accurate?  Are you as accurate at 50' to 70' when you aren't hauling?<br>
<br>
I'd wager to state that you also have different modes when you haul.  In other words, when the wind is blowing 20 mph then you really RIP your hauls and when the wind is calm then so is your hauling.  Am I right?  If I've not figured out anything as a rookie caster I've figured out that FF is a lot like dancing with my wife.  When we get into a well practiced groove it is effortless.  When I dance with a certain friend's wife she won't follow and fights my movements.  It is work to dance with her and if FF was like that I'd go back to spinning tackle or bait casting.  I'm approaching FF casting as correct physical motion centered in rhythm, tempo and feel.  I'm looking forward to the day when I can say that fly casting is as comfortable as a waltz with my wife.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
BTW, Beverly says hi and that we should collaborate on a book that addresses the specific needs of the female fly fisher.  Clothes, hats, coodinating colors would be at the top of the list, I'm sure.  In the chapter on casting there would have to be a paragraph or two devoted to casting without ruining a manicure.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I asked her if a single console bass boat would work for us and her concern was for her hair blowing in the wind.  Bimini tops and tops with side curtains are more on her list of approved boat designs.  Live wells, transom height, freeboard, gunnels, bait wells, 12 vs. 24 volt trolling motors and hull designs are of no interest at all.  She is also invoking her right not to clean fish.  She wants to catch them and eat them and she might even be willing to cook them, but dealing with fish on the hoof, forget it.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You crack me up!  Thanks for the nice compliments.  You were doing very well on Saturday, for sure.  You'll catch plenty of fish with the casting you are doing.  If I can re-emphasize one point, it's to try to PULL THE LINE INTO MOTION.  If your acceleration doesn't begin before the rod reaches the 12:00 position, then you have to cram an entire acceleration stroke into a very short distance.  It brings on the tailing loops as you get more and more line out.<br>
<br>
Yes, I am definitely more accurate and comfortable overall when I am hauling.  It is not just about increasing line speed to me.  It's about overall control of the system.  Having two hands sharing the work allows better refinement of the mechanics.  The smoothness and grace is achieved by eliminating as close to 100% of the slack as you can achieve.  Hauling helps me to do that.  And since you are doing a significant portion of the work with the line hand, the rod hand will not get as tired as it would without a haul.<br>
<br>
Now I will admit, when I am casting very short, like under 20', I don't haul all the time.   Especially when I am tuck casting and high-sticking.  Then, I typically have my left hand on the wading staff, and my right hand is the only hand fishing.  <br>
<br>
My haul definitely has as many styles and intensities as my casting stroke with the rod.  Maybe more, in fact.  With a tiny dry fly that I need to flick sharply under an overhanging tree, my haul would be very short and sharp.  When I lob a big bass popper onto a glassy smooth surface, my haul is very long, but slow.  Just like the casting stroke I'm making with the rod.<br>
<br>
When I'm out in the bays in winter, blind casting the guts, I like to cast as far as I can.  The further you cast, the fewer times you have to.  And the more time the fly is in the water with the fish.  In this case, I start in a half-squat, leaning forward on my left foot, and the rod tip is in the water.  I aggressively accelerate the rod from this position to my final stopping position, about 180 degrees of total stroke.  80% of my weight has shifted to my back (right) foot.  And of course, there's a haul mixed in, and it's vicious.  My intention is to get that 60 feet of line SMOKIN, so I can shoot about 15 or 20 feet into the backcast.  Then when it's unrolled behind, a similar agressive forward stroke to launch the remainder of the line.  If I can get from 60 feet to 100 feet in a single pick up and lay down, I'm happy.  False casting in the wind is futile.<br>
<br>
As described in that previous paragraph, my casting stroke is very tight and controlled.  I think and concentrate very hard on making the tip move in the absolute straightest line that I can, right up to the stop.  It's easier to hold it all together with a single pickup and lay down.  But it's a lot like work, and not the relaxing &quot;zen&quot; kind of casting that most people crave.  Sure is effective for the purpose, though...<br>
<br>
I don't know much about women, ask my wife.  I don't think I could write a book about teaching them much of anything....  Just kidding, of course.  In many ways, it's easier to teach women and children, than to teach men that have been fishing all their lives with other types of tackle.  Ladies and kids listen better than we do....  And they don't have that darned baitcaster's wrist flick....<br>
<br>
Are you coming to the Sunfish Spectacular down at Seven Lakes this weekend, John?  We're gonna have our last casting class right after the BBQ.  We are also having a casting carnival before the BBQ that will be lots of fun.  Accuracy, loop control, distance.  Kinda like an obstacle course with a flyrod.  And of course, we'll have prizes for the longest cast, most consecutive casts in the hoola hoop, etc.  Let me know if you need directions.<br>

 Hauling is nothing more than Total Line control.<br>
 The single haul going backward or backcasting is the easiest. Your hands are moving apart. ON the front cast your hands are coming together. So you have to get the line hand moving a little faster. <br>
 Now to gain more control how about a third haul.<br>
 Lets say you want to cast around a stump.<br>
 right sidearm cast. little haul on the back cast to help load the backcast. A other haul on the front cast to increase the line speed. Now just as the line is straighting out. Give the third haul and watch the last 6 feet of line come around the stump in a nice left hook.<br>
 How about a Tuck or dump cast. Starts with a over head cast. increase the line speed. Aim a little high.<br>
 Give a Third haul as the line straightens. Watch the fly drop down under the loop and settle on the water.<br>
  These are all hauls the hauls are used to increase the line speed to almost over loading the rod and causing the kick back to help place your fly.<br>
 Like I said in the beginning Hauls are for line control. If your rod is loading you can control the line better. <br>
 As once was said I forget who. &quot;Line Speed line speed line speed.&quot;<br>

<br>
Enjoyed your post and after chewing on it a while I see the reasoning with respect to hauling.  As a FF rookie my mind works things through intellectually because I don't yet have the experiencial reference.  Things that are obvious to everyone else on the forum are revelations to me.  Right now I'm the proverbial sponge trying to soak it all in.  <br>
<br>
Your description of the third haul was great and it conjured the image you intended.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>
<br>
