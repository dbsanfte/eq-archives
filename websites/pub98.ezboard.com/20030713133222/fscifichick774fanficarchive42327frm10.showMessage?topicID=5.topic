Author’s Note: My CSI muse has been dead and buried for a long time, so this fic is more for Melindotty than anyone else because she requested it.  It’s all angsty fluff, so don’t go looking for a plot that isn’t there (in other words, all the case stuff is filler).  Hope you like it. <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“Sindee Campbell.  S-i-n-d-e-e,” Warrick said as he and Sara rode the elevator to the victim’s tenth story apartment.  “You think that was her real name?”  Sara grinned at the joking quality in his voice.<br>
<br>
“Could be.  You can never tell these days,” she answered.  Warrick gave a partial roll of his eyes and shook his head lightly.  “Warrick is *your* real name, and it’s not common,” she pointed out.<br>
<br>
“It’s a family name,” he said.  Sara smiled.<br>
<br>
“Well, Vegas is Sin City; maybe her name is some sort of tribute,” she only half-joked.  Sindee’s apartment wasn’t far from the elevators and the second Sara saw the living room through the open door, she smiled brightly at Warrick.  “Or not.”<br>
<br>
The police officers watched them slip on their synthetic latex gloves and then stepped aside as Sara and Warrick entered the apartment.  Brass gave a nod of his head to acknowledge their presence and they walked over to him; Sara carrying a collection kit and the camera dangling from Warrick’s neck.  Brass looked tired and gave Sara a warning look when he saw the teasing grin on her lips.<br>
<br>
“Don’t start,” he said.  The apartment, or at least the living room, was decked out much like a club.  The multi-colored lighting was spinning and pulsating, and Sara was certain they could find a button for the strobe light with a little effort.  The living room had a pole in the middle of the room and what little furniture there was seemed to be angled around it.  <br>
<br>
“Dancer?”  Warrick asked, guessing the woman’s occupation.  <br>
<br>
“Accountant,” Brass answered.  Warrick looked surprised and Sara just smiled as she got her collection kit ready.<br>
<br>
“Too bad.  If she was a dancer then she could have written all this stuff off,” she said.  Brass snickered.  Warrick frowned when he held the camera up to his eye.<br>
<br>
“Is there any other lighting in here besides *that*?”<br>
<br>
“You wish,” Brass said.  “You can open the curtains or I can request some standing lights be brought in.”  Warrick nodded.<br>
<br>
“Do that.  We don’t want to disrupt the scene by opening the curtains.”<br>
<br>
Brass nodded and left with the officers while Sara started collecting what evidence she could see that didn’t need pictures taken of it first.  Warrick looked around and pointed out the things that caught his eye, but he couldn’t take any pictures until the lighting was sent over.  Sara, despite the environment, was in ‘the zone’ and not talking much unless it was to herself about something she found.  Warrick was bored and decided to start up a conversation.  If nothing else, he figured he could tease Sara as subtly as he could about her relationship with Hank.<br>
<br>
“How’s Hank?”  He asked casually.  Sara didn’t even turn to look at him when she answered.<br>
<br>
“Fine as far as I know,” she said.  Warrick arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“As far as you know?”<br>
<br>
“What does this look like to you?”  She asked, bypassing his question by pointing at the still wet stain on the floor.  He narrowed his eyes as he crouched down to look at it.<br>
<br>
“It’s not blood.  It doesn’t look thick enough to be paint.  You get a sample?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah,” she said and flashed him a quick smile.  “I’m just impatient.”  He nodded knowingly and stood up.  Warrick took a few steps around the area and Sara smiled at him again as she placed a swab into a collection bag.  “You’re bored.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah,” he acknowledged.  “What kind of person has club lighting as regular lighting for their apartment?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” she said.  “Maybe she just couldn’t get enough of the scene?  Didn’t you tell me that it can be addictive?”<br>
<br>
“Sometimes,” he answered with a shrug.  “But it can also get really old really fast.”  She grinned at him.<br>
<br>
“Don’t tell me they won’t be expecting you at Venus this weekend?”  Sara asked in mock surprise.  Warrick grinned.<br>
<br>
“I’m working this weekend,” he said.  “But I could leave a message with the bouncer if *you* want to go.”  Sara snorted at the absurd teasing comment.<br>
<br>
“Not my thing, remember?”  She started to label something, but looked up at him briefly.  “And I’m a little hurt that you don’t think I could get in by myself,” she joked.<br>
<br>
“You could,” Warrick responded and then leaned his head to the side and gave her a measured look.  “But Hank couldn’t.”  Sara finished what she was doing and looked directly in his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Greg told you,” she said in an observational tone.  She shook her head and started to look around the room.  “I knew I shouldn’t have told him.”  Warrick allowed himself to frown, but only because Sara’s eyes weren’t focused on him.  Greg knew something he didn’t?<br>
<br>
“Yeah, because Greg and I are always having those deep, meaningful conversations,” he said sarcastically.  Sara chuckled and swept some hair behind her ear.  “What happened?”  He asked seriously.<br>
<br>
“We broke up,” Sara admitted.  <br>
<br>
“Sorry.  I didn’t know.”<br>
<br>
“It’s okay, no big deal,” she said.<br>
<br>
“Ouch.”<br>
<br>
“It wasn’t like that,” Sara argued.  “You know how it is.  You date someone from work, but you barely get to see each other *because* of work.  We’re still friends.”<br>
<br>
“Okay.”  His tone indicated that he didn’t believe her and Sara shot him a forced grin.  “But you didn’t actually work with him, so you can’t use that as an excuse.”<br>
<br>
“Yes I ---”<br>
<br>
“If you had worked *with* him, then he would be a CSI.  And no offense, but he’s not that smart.”  He watched her mouth open slightly to speak, but he cut her off.  “Which I’m guessing is the real reason you dumped him.”  Sara was silent for a second while she considered her response.  Warrick could be entirely too insightful for his own good.  <br>
<br>
“What makes you think I dumped him?”  She finally asked.  One corner of Warrick’s mouth curled upward.<br>
<br>
“Well, he wasn’t going to dump you,” he pointed out.  There was another pause.  “No comeback?”  Sara’s lips curled into a smile.<br>
<br>
“I was going to ask why you’re suddenly so interested in my personal life, but then it struck me.  You’ve been hanging out with Nick too much,” she finally said.  A strange expression crossed Warrick’s face and he nodded.<br>
<br>
“I think you might have a point,” he said somewhat begrudgingly.  After pausing for a minute he looked serious again.  “Another man?”<br>
<br>
“What?”  Sara had gone back to trying to scan the apartment with her eyes, and was taken a little off guard by Warrick’s question.  He shrugged.<br>
<br>
“You two seemed to be getting along okay, and if you didn’t dump him then ---”<br>
<br>
“I wasn’t cheating on him, Warrick.  Sometimes things just don’t work out.”<br>
<br>
“Another woman?”  He asked.  Sara laughed.<br>
<br>
“I’m straight.”<br>
<br>
“That’s not what I meant.”<br>
<br>
“I know what you meant,” she said.  Their eyes caught each other and they stared at each other silently until a voice came bellowing into the apartment from the doorway.<br>
<br>
“Let there be light.”  Brass’s voice snapped them out of their thoughts and both turned to look at him.  A couple of the officers helped to set up the lighting and then Brass turned off the club lighting in the apartment.  <br>
<br>
“Thanks Brass,” Sara said.  “I was starting to get a headache.”<br>
<br>
“No problem.  You need a ride back?”<br>
<br>
“I’m gonna take a look around again now that we have good lighting.  See if there’s anything I missed,” she said.  Brass nodded and gave a small wave of his hand.<br>
<br>
“Later.”<br>
<br>
Brass left and Warrick started placing number cards down and taking pictures for evidence.  At the same time, Sara began looking around for any additional evidence that she may have missed.  The next twenty minutes went by without them saying anything to each other.<br>
<br>
“Done?”  Warrick finally asked.  Sara nodded.<br>
<br>
“I think that’s all I’m going to get for now.  Good thing Brass brought the lights over though.  I would have missed a few hairs and fiber samples,” she said.  Warrick nodded absently as his eyes fixed on the tape outlining where the victim’s body had been.<br>
<br>
“Accountant,” he muttered under his breath.<br>
<br>
“You never can tell,” Sara said.  Their eyes caught each other’s again and after a while, Warrick nodded once in agreement.<br>
<br>
“No, you never can.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TBC… (maybe)<br>

So – this chapter will have spoilers for that episode and might not be very good.  Sorry about that.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Warrick spotted Sara peering into a microscope and quietly entered the lab.  It almost seemed like she had been avoiding him, but Warrick knew better than to take it personally.  She was the kind of woman who lived for her job – and that was part of the problem.<br>
<br>
He walked up right next to her before she even noticed him.  Sara glanced at him through the corner of her eye and then grinned.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” she greeted.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” he said.  Sara didn’t elaborate on whatever it was that she was working on like she usually did, so Warrick took the opening he was given.  “You lied to me.”  Sara looked up at him with a confused expression on her face.<br>
<br>
“When did I do that?”<br>
<br>
“You said you and Hank didn’t break up because of another woman.”<br>
<br>
“No, I didn’t,” she said with a slight twinkle in her eye, only dulled because of the topic they were discussing.  “I said that we didn’t break up because of another man.  When you asked me about another woman, I dodged the question.”  She stopped talking and tilted her head to the side.  “How did you find out about that anyway?”  Warrick gave her a small grin and she rolled her eyes.  “God, Catherine has a big mouth.”  She went back to looking at the samples under the microscope and didn’t notice that Warrick leaned his back against the counter.<br>
<br>
“Apparently so do you after you’ve had a few drinks,” he said.  Sara didn’t look up at him this time.<br>
<br>
“I don’t suppose we could *not* talk about this?”<br>
<br>
“Sure,” Warrick said with a shrug of his shoulders.  “But what was with all that female bonding stuff?  I would have taken you out for a beer if you told me about it.”<br>
<br>
Sara laughed.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but you would’ve taken me to one of those nightclubs on the strip.”<br>
<br>
“Where’d Catherine take you?”<br>
<br>
“Little bar over on Sahara,” she answered.<br>
<br>
“Nice?”<br>
<br>
“It served its purpose,” Sara stated with a wry grin.<br>
<br>
“The purpose being to get you drunk,” Warrick said in an observational tone.<br>
<br>
“Yep.”<br>
<br>
Warrick folded his arms across his chest and shook his head slightly.  Hank had really done a job on Sara and it might be a while before she even considered getting away from her semi-antisocial tendencies again.  <br>
<br>
“You talk to anyone while you were there?”  Warrick asked, already knowing what the answer would be.<br>
<br>
“Catherine.”<br>
<br>
“Besides Catherine?”  He asked.  Sara opened her mouth to speak, but Warrick cut her off.  “Or the bartender.”<br>
<br>
“Not that I recall.”<br>
<br>
“Ah.  So it was one of *those* drunk nights.”<br>
<br>
Sara turned to Warrick with an exasperated look on her face.<br>
<br>
“What’s with you today?”<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
<br>
“At the scene, you were asking me a bunch of personal questions, but I thought that was because you were bored.  And now, you’re ---”<br>
<br>
“I’m just trying to be your friend, Sara.  It’s not healthy to make your life all about the job.”<br>
<br>
Sara sighed and closed her eyes for a second.  <br>
<br>
“I thought you’d been hanging around Nick, but apparently you’ve been hanging around Grissom,” she mumbled under her breath and then turned to sort through some samples.  Warrick looked at her quizzically.  “He said the same thing a couple of years ago,” she explained.  Warrick raised his eyebrows thoughtfully and then gave her a pointed look.  Sara forced a tight grin onto her lips.  “Look, I’m fine.  *Really*.  Okay?”  Warrick got a determined look on his face and Sara barely held back a cringe.  “What?”<br>
<br>
“You’re going out with me tonight.”<br>
<br>
“Excuse me?”<br>
<br>
“You heard me,” Warrick said.  “I’ll take you to that dive on Sahara if you want, but I don’t want you to go back to the way you were.”  Sara arched an eyebrow at him.<br>
<br>
“And how was I?”<br>
<br>
“Completely anti-social,” he said without any hesitation.  “The people here care about you, Sara.”  Sara looked at him skeptically and he tilted his head to the side.  “And I’ll catch hell from Catherine if you crawl back under your rock again.”<br>
<br>
“Nice,” she said sarcastically.  Warrick grinned.  <br>
<br>
“So, are you goin’ or what?”<br>
<br>
“It didn’t sound like you were giving me a choice,” she said observantly.<br>
<br>
“Good point,” Warrick agreed, pushing himself away from the counter.  “We can leave after work.”  He started to walk toward the door when Catherine appeared in the doorway.<br>
<br>
“You can leave after work for *where*?” she asked curiously, and if Sara didn’t know any better, then she would say almost *teasingly*.  Sara flashed a smile at Catherine.<br>
<br>
“Warrick wants to have a girl’s night out,” she said cheekily.  Catherine arched an eyebrow at him and Warrick rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“I told her I was taking her out,” he tried to explain to Catherine.  Catherine’s lips curled into a Cheshire-like smile.<br>
<br>
“Like on a date?” she teased, stealing a glance past Warrick at Sara.<br>
<br>
“No,” Sara replied.  “And I wouldn’t even be going if you hadn’t told him about Hank.”  Catherine shrugged unrepentantly and looked at Warrick.<br>
<br>
“Oh.  Well, glad I told you then,” she said, giving him another smile.  Sara pursed her lips and went back to looking through the microscope.  “So, as long as this is just a ‘friends’ thing, do you mind if I come?”  Warrick shot her a look which Catherine had to try desperately hard not to laugh at.<br>
<br>
“Sure – whatever,” Sara answered, not looking up at the two of them.  Catherine’s smile was beaming and her eyes were fixed on a somewhat upset looking Warrick.<br>
<br>
“Oh, wait.  I forgot.  My sitter is out of town,” she said, the smile still plastered on her face.  Warrick gave her a tight grin.<br>
<br>
“Maybe next time,” Sara said, still not looking up from the specimen.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah!  That’d be great,” Catherine said.  She turned to walk out back into the hallway when she stopped herself.  “Oh, yeah!  Grissom wants us all in his office in ten – or at least it was ten a few minutes ago.”  She mumbled the last part to herself and walked away without another word.  <br>
<br>
Warrick leaned against the door frame and waited for what Catherine said to sink into Sara’s brain.  Sara raised her head and was seemingly staring at the wall in front of her.<br>
<br>
“Did she just say we’re supposed to be in Grissom’s office?”<br>
<br>
“Yup.”<br>
<br>
“Oh.”  Sara started putting away the samples and specimens and was surprised to see that Warrick was still waiting for her when she finished.  She smiled at him as they walked out of the lab.  “Why didn’t you just go ahead?  You could have told them I would be late.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, right,” Warrick said, unconvinced.  “If I told them that, then they’d think you were never coming.”<br>
<br>
“I am *not* that bad,” she protested.<br>
<br>
“Yes you are,” he said with a light grin.  Sara smiled and shook her head.<br>
<br>
This was going to be an interesting night.<br>
<br>

<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Warrick and Sara walked into Grissom’s office, the other CSI staff turning around to look at them as they came in.  Grissom briefly glanced at them, giving them a nod of acknowledgement along with a somewhat disapproving look for their two minute tardiness, but quickly turned his attention back to the folders on his desk.  <br>
<br>
“Ok-ay,” he started, stringing out his word as he looked back and forth between a couple of folders.  Making a decision, he held one out to Catherine as he spoke.  “You and Nick get the Jane Doe who washed up in the Lake Mead Rec Area.  The call-in said her head and hands were cut off, so we need to do everything we can to identify the body.”  Catherine’s eyebrows rose as an unspoken question.  When Grissom chose to ignore it, Nick spoke up.<br>
<br>
“Are we gonna have to call in the feds?”<br>
<br>
Grissom gave him an expression that lay somewhere between a blank stare and a cutting look.  <br>
<br>
“Not if you do your job,” he answered, raising his voice at the end as a hint that Nick and Catherine should be on their way.  <br>
<br>
Catherine barely resisted the urge to snicker as they made their way out of the office.  Warrick and Sara watched them leave and when Sara turned back around to face Grissom, she had a smile on her face.<br>
<br>
“So – Nick and Catherine get a db – what do we get?” she asked.  Warrick’s eyes fell to the floor as he shook his head a little in disbelief.  She lived for the job - that much was obvious; the question was how he could get her to live her life without her job being the central focus.<br>
<br>
“A night off actually,” Grissom answered without looking up from the other folder on his desk.  Sara looked like she had just been punched in the gut.  She stood there staring at him, blinking a couple of times as if she expected what he had said to change.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
Grissom finally looked up and gave her a small grin.<br>
<br>
“I know you’re unfamiliar with the concept, but you and Warrick get a night off.  Brass just let me know that the boyfriend confessed on the Campbell case you two were working on and I’m taking Greg on the Rick Everson case ---”<br>
<br>
“You’re taking *Greg*?” Sara interrupted, the shock and hurt coming through in her voice.  “But ---” <br>
<br>
Grissom sighed and placed his hands down on his desk as he looked straight into Sara’s eyes.<br>
<br>
“He needs field experience, Sara, and the Everson case looks like a nice easy one to get him started on.”<br>
<br>
“Easy?” Sara scoffed.  “I thought you said we should never assume anything?”<br>
<br>
“I said it *looks like* an easy case, not that it would be,” Grissom countered and then turned his attention back to getting his things together.  “Besides, Catherine said that you had a night out planned.”<br>
<br>
“Nothing that we couldn’t cancel,” Sara protested.  Grissom stared at her for a second.<br>
<br>
“We?” he asked.  <br>
<br>
“Wa---”<br>
<br>
Grissom quickly shook his head and grabbed his keys, choosing not to dwell on her choice of wording any longer than he needed to.  He placed his hand on her shoulder as he came around the desk and gave her a stubborn expression.  <br>
<br>
“The point is that it’s nothing that you *need* to cancel,” he said, cutting off what she was about to say.  “Life is a system of checks and balances and you can’t let one area of your life take over the others.”  Sara lifted one eyebrow into the air, silently mocking him, and Grissom gave her a tight grin.  “Unless you’re me.”  He nodded his head at Warrick as a goodbye and motioned for them to leave the room so he could lock the door behind him.<br>
<br>
Sara watched him leave, collecting an already waiting and somewhat hyperactive-looking Greg along the way.<br>
<br>
“Ever feel like you’re being ganged up on?” she asked, not turning around to look at Warrick as she spoke.<br>
<br>
“Only when I am.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“No offense, Sara, but ---”<br>
<br>
“I know, I know,” Sara interrupted and then took a swig from the bottle of beer in front of her, “I have bad taste in men.”<br>
<br>
Warrick tilted his head to the side and a bemused grin overtook his lips.<br>
<br>
“Sounds like you’ve heard that before,” he observed.<br>
<br>
“Several times,” she confirmed.  “But you know, maybe that’s the way it’s supposed to be.”<br>
<br>
Warrick raised an eyebrow before taking a drink of his own beer.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”  <br>
<br>
He knew it was a dangerous topic to get into, but he figured it was worth a shot given that their entire conversation since they had gotten to the bar an hour and a half ago had been teetering on the edge of appropriate for what kind of friends they were.   Friends, but there was always the hint of a possibility of something more; the awkward pauses when they would just be looking at each other, the not-so-subtle friendly flirting they did when they worked together; it was enough to make Warrick wonder whether he really wanted to hear Sara’s answer to the question he just asked.<br>
<br>
Sara leaned closer to him in an attempt to talk over the loud country music pouring out of the jukebox.  <br>
<br>
“Well, not everyone can have a boyfriend who buys them three hundred dollar purses, now can they?” she asked wryly, the corners of her lips curling upward into an almost teasing grin.  “Maybe, because of the kind of person I am, the job I do, maybe short and only partial relationships are the best I’m going to be able to do.  Can you really see me with the white picket fence, 3.2 kids, and ---” she trailed off when she saw the serious look on his face, like he was boring into her soul with his eyes.  “What?”<br>
<br>
He paused for a second before answering, shifting the intense look on his face into something a little more lighthearted, hoping that he had done it in time for her not to be too suspicious of what he had been thinking.<br>
<br>
“That always bothered me,” he finally said.  “How can someone have twenty percent of a kid?”  Sara beamed him an impish smile.<br>
<br>
“Joint custody?” she teasingly suggested, tilting back her bottle of beer to empty out the remainder of the cool beverage into her mouth.  Warrick gave her a half roll of his eyes and shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Leave it to you to come up with an answer like that.”<br>
<br>
“What?  They have to get the stats somewhere, right?”<br>
<br>
Warrick glanced past her and let out a small sigh before lightly shaking his head again.<br>
<br>
“Uh oh,” Sara said.  “Not another one?” she asked pleadingly.<br>
<br>
“What’s that make?  Five or six?”<br>
<br>
Sara groaned and let her head flop forward.  A different man had come over to hit on her every ten to fifteen minutes since they had arrived at the small dive of a bar and Warrick had made a game out of it by guessing how many drinks it had taken for them to get up the intoxicated bravado to come and ask her out.  She watched as Warrick leaned back in his chair, carefully observing the man who had just risen from his seat and was slowly making his way over to their table.<br>
<br>
“He’s had at least four,” he said confidently.  <br>
<br>
“Great,” Sara responded with heavy sarcasm.  “You’d think they’d get the hint after watching every other shlup walk away alone.”<br>
<br>
“Shlup?”<br>
<br>
Sara winced.<br>
<br>
“I’ve been listening to Greg too much,” she said.  Warrick grinned and nodded slightly as an acceptance of what she said.<br>
<br>
“Here’s what I don’t get,” he said, leaning forward in his chair again, “they seem to be disregarding the fact that I’m sitting here with you.”  Sara let out a half snort followed by a bright smile.<br>
<br>
“Upset that you’re not the one getting attention?” <br>
<br>
“Funny,” he said with a purse of his lips and a small glare.  “And no.  What I meant was that you’d think seeing another guy at the table would ward them off.”<br>
<br>
“I guess,” she said.  “But you’re not exactly ---”<br>
<br>
“What?” Warrick asked pointedly, the grin on his lips betraying his tone of voice.  “Just because I don’t have the Grissom glare down doesn’t mean that I can’t look imposing.”  Sara smiled again at her friend’s reference, knowing the look Warrick was talking about only too well.<br>
<br>
“Hey sugar,” a slurred male voice said from the side of the table.  “What’s a pretty little ---” the man trailed off when he noticed the look on Warrick’s face.  Sara followed his eyes and had to slap her hand over her mouth as her body shook with silent laughter at Warrick’s almost perfect impression of Grissom’s annoyed and threatening glare.  The drunken stranger cleared his throat and stumbled backward a couple of steps.  “Right.  Hey – sorry man.  I didn’t know she was taken.”<br>
<br>
Sara and Warrick watched him walk away and then a burst of loud laughter erupted from Sara’s throat.  Warrick smiled amicably and then took the last swig of his beer.  Sara shook her head, trying to get her laughter to lessen.<br>
<br>
“I’d say you have it down pretty well,” she said.  “How long have you been practicing that?”<br>
<br>
“Oh no,” Warrick said.  “I tell you, you tell Gris, and I’m in deep shit.”<br>
<br>
“What makes you think I’ll tell Grissom?” she asked, her smile threatening to spread off her face.<br>
<br>
“Cuz’ you think you need to get back into his good graces.”<br>
<br>
Sara frowned and it only deepened when she realized that she didn’t have any beer left to quell the awkward silence that seemed inevitable.  <br>
<br>
“You know me too well for someone who barely knows me,” she grumbled, half-thinking that Warrick wouldn’t hear her over the bar’s background noise.<br>
<br>
“I know you better than you think,” he retorted.  They stared at each other, the rest of the world seemingly slipping away for a moment.  Warrick leaned over and tucked some stray hairs behind her ear.  It was innocent enough to be construed as a friendly gesture, but tactile enough to illicit a response either way.  “But not as well as I’d like to.”<br>
<br>
Sara opened her mouth in surprise, but quickly closed it, the corners of her lips curling upward into a smile as she arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Well enough to make this girls’ night out thing a regular event?”<br>
<br>
Warrick tilted his head to the side and grinned at her.<br>
<br>
“Only if you stop calling it a girls’ night out,” he said.  Sara chuckled and nodded, pushing the fallen hair back behind her ear again as it fell with her laugh.<br>
<br>
“I think I can handle that.”  Warrick’s grin grew into a half-smile and when he rose from his chair, he offered his hand out to Sara to help her stand up.  When she stood and he didn’t let go of her hand, she looked down to where their hands were joined.  He noticed her looking and interwove his fingers with hers, looking expectantly at her for a reaction.  She smiled and nodded before looking down for a second as they started to walk out of the bar.  ‘Yeah.  I think I can handle that.’<br>
<br>
