Chapter 1<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matt sprung up in his creaky bed, cold sweat running down his face. He was having one of those dreams again. It was the same everytime. Walking along a long, dark hall, untill he stumbled into a room. He would look around him and see nothing but blue-flamed candles. Then they would suddenly go out and he would hear an ear-peircing scream.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Deciding that maybe a glass of water would make him feel a bit better, Matt dragged himself out of bed and slowly walked to the kitchen. Having done this many nights in a row. He no longer needed to flick on the lights. He filled a cup to it's brim and gulped hastily. He walked by his parent's room and glared at them enviously as they lay in bed, not a worry to their names.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next morning Matt woke up and stared at the sunlight flittering through his room. He rolled over on his side trying to avoid the light. His mother rapped on the door sharply, &quot;Matty, it's time to get ready for school, dear!&quot;. Matt hated the name &quot;Matty&quot;, but his mother loved it. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Okay...,&quot; Matt managed to mumble out of the side of his mouth. He slid out from under the covers and dragged his feet all the way over to the closet. He pulled a t-shirt and a pair of pants off of their hangers without even looking to see which ones he had randomly picked. He slipped them on and walked downstairs.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Toast, eggs, or bacon, honey,&quot; Matt's mom asked casually.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I-I'm not hungry,&quot; Matt grunted back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Okay, I guess that's fine...&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matt walked to the bathroom and brushed his teeth quickly. He had to meet one of his friends in... He glanced at his watch. Matt was late by 4 minutes!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh @#%$!&quot; shouted Matt out loud.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hey...&quot; Matt's mother had overheard him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Sorry mom...&quot; Matt choked out as he was running towards the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Forgetting something?&quot; His mom dangled his keys.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matt reached out and grabbed them, he was in a rush and had no time to fool around with his mother. He sprinted outside and leaped inside his camaro. He started it up and sped off to school.<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matt parked his camaro in the usual spot... Under the tree, next to the girl's locker room exit. He sat and waited for his friend to skate up to him, like every morning. He waited for about 5 minutes and started to get a look of concern on his face. He pulled out and drove around the outside of the school's vacinity. He could see no sign of his friend. He was really getting concerned now. His friend had a perfect attendance record. Matt decided to drive over to his house. It took several knocks before someone answered. &quot;Is Greg here?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Greg is sick...&quot; spat out Greg's dad.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What? Greg is never sick!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I don't care what you think... Greg is sick.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Can I see him?&quot; Matt pushed past his friend's father before he could answer. Matt ran upstairs and bursted into Greg's room. Greg was lying there... bright blue. &quot;What's happened to you?!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Greg could only fit out one word... &quot;cold...&quot; Greg feinted.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matt ran forward to help out his unconcious friend. Greg's dad stumbled into the room and Matt looked at him like he was mad. &quot;Why the hell didn't you take him to the hospital?!&quot; Matt picked Greg up and carried him outside to his car. Matt drove off to the hospital looking back to make sure his friend was still breathing every few seconds. &quot;Come on, hold on, you can do it!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matt pulled up to the hospital and leaped out of his camaro carrying Greg on pure adrenaline.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once the nurse at the front desk saw Greg she yelled out, &quot;It's another one!&quot; And she bolted forward to aid Matt. About another four doctors also ran forward to help.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matt looked at the nurse strangely. &quot;What do you mean another one? This has been happening to other people?!&quot; The nurse nodded. &quot;What is it?!&quot; Matt was losing his temper.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We don't know yet. All we know is that if we don't get him back to normal temperature soon. Your friends heart will freeze over.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matt stared wide-eyed at his friend that now was starting to turn a darker tinge of blue. &quot;Help him! Please!&quot; Matt was starting to grow tears in his eyes. Greg was always a good friend. And if Matt let down his friend now... He would never be able to live with himself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not knowing what he was doing, Matt grabbed Greg's face and it felt as though a part of him were going over to Greg. Greg's normal color was starting to return, and Matt was starting to feel a bit... chilled. Matt held on, amazed with himself. Greg's rosy cheeks were starting to return and Matt was starting to feel as though he were standing in front of an open refridgerator.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What are you doing?&quot; All the doctors asked at once. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matt shrugged and said &quot;I really don't know...&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One of the doctors shouted, &quot;Look!&quot; And he pointed out Greg's normal complexion. Matt was starting to get really cold, yet, he still clung on.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Greg coughed and slowly opened his eyes. He looked up at Matt and said, &quot;What are you doin', bud?&quot; Matt suddenly felt the cold ceasing from his fingertips. And the rest of his body started to dispose of the cold. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Matt felt normal again and he beamed at his friend, &quot;You're late for school...&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Greg looked at his watch and shouted, &quot;OH @#%$!&quot; <p><div align=center>
