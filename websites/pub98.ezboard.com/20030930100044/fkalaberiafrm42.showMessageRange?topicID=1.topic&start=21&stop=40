<br>
&quot;This city has hundreds of exits, and those can also be used as entrances to things we cannot afford to have brought in here.

I have to head up there in a few hours, if you wish to wonder about feel free, I know Taylee must be exhausted, and I need to catch a little bit of sleep myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>With that Vania rolled up the map and entered back into the dome, not waiting for a reply on what the woman would do.

She also wondered how many more she would find like Taylee, she could not keep on showing such kindness, she was going soft. But she was so sick of killing...so tired of it.

<br>
Gone was the harshness with which she'd informed Taylee what she wanted from her . It almost sounded like Vania was sympathizing with her. Hostility Taylee could deal with but she wasn't so sure about sympathy.<br>
<br>
Taylee watched as the other girl moved around the room putting away the map then she lay down on the bed and lit a cigarette. &quot;What other question are there?&quot; the blonde girl shrugged from where she sat with her back against the wall, &quot;Can you keep me safe?....I don't think for a minute that you can. Will the people here accept me? ...I doubt it. Will they hate me even if I do this and become bait?....I'm certain they will.&quot; Taylee laughed harshly, &quot;But what choice do I have. If I go back up there it'll only be a matter of time until they catch me and I become their slave again. So....I guess your answer is yes.&quot; <br>
<br>
Taylee leaned her head back against the wall and stared up at the ceiling.

<br>
&quot;I know you find yourself trapped in a situation that you do not understand. I did not intend to trap you with in our society, but I could not just leave you running about above, not with such things chasing you down. If you wish to leave, I am supposed to kill you, however, I will take you above, but do know this. If you ever speak to anyone of this city above grounds, I will hunt you down and kill you.  I may not entirely agree with our society, but I do care for the children that play in these tunnels. They are our hope, they are what we fight for. <br>
<br>
The councel will not be happy to see you, but they will accept you. Not because I brought you in, and not because they will see in you what I do, but because they can use you as they use me. They will use you as bait. It is dangerious, but I will do my best to keep you alive. I cannot promise your survival, but I will not put you in an overly dangerious situation either. You have a will to survive, I can see that in you. Honestly, I do not think I would have survived above ground as long as you have. I might fight them on a somewhat regular basis, but I have this refuge to run to, you had nothing. <br>
<br>
Your master, so to speak, is dead, hence forth you are technically no longer a ghoul. They won't see it that way, so it is important that you try to avoid the subject around people as much as possible. If people ask how you survived so long above, tell them that were's took care of you. The only people that need to know who you are is myself and the council. A few others know for the mere fact that I have been tracking you for sometime now. <br>
<br>
I suggest for now you get some rest, we go out tonight  after I present you. We need to get to the older vampires so we can get into the tower. I need to know your weaknesses, and your strengths because if I don't know your every anticipated move, I can not only get you killed, but myself as well. But try not to think about these things now, just get some rest, I will wake you in an hour or two and show you about the city and get you some new clothing, and some blankets for a bed. You can decorate this place as you want, I never seem to have time to make my home feel well, like a home. &quot;<br>

&quot;It is my job to know who you are Taylea, it is my job to know who  owns who. We track alot of ghouls in the city, hoping to get closer to the higher up. See, the older one's seek companions, companions such as yourself. They grow weary of their own company, they want fresh minds, nieve minds so that they can mold them into whatever their hearts desire. The younger ones, the ones that don't matter, just kill. <br>
<br>
I do know that another is seeking you, I did not know his name untill now. If we get high enough up, it will start a chain reaction, and the older ones will come out of hiding, they will come to avenge their companions. If we can defeat them, the others, the mass, will begin to fear. And then they will die off. It is a simple plan, but difficult. Many of us won't live to see the end of it, I hope I might be one and survive, though my chances are just as high as anyone else's. <br>
<br>
At this councel, I need you to try, try to remember everything you can about where they kept you, and who you spoke to. We have to get inside, there is no other way. Though I am not taking you inside once we get there, I might not be as pretty as you, but if I can get in they might concider trying to make me a ghoul, only thing is, before they even get a chance I will kill them.&quot;<br>

That's how they'd see it, her as just some vampire's possession. Shaking those thoughts away she turned her attention back to what Vania was saying.<br>
<br>
What did it matter if the other girl knew Cale's name...it wouldn't make any difference. Her plan was flawed. The old vampires were very smart...that's why they'd survived so long, and they wouldn't be fooled by her. <br>
<br>
Taylee knew that sooner or later she would have to say something to Vania about the plan but as the other girl set down her gun and looked Taylee in the eye, she knew now was not the time. Why would Vania trust anything she had to say until she knew Taylee better.<br>

Taylee followed the other girl out into the artificial light and stopped. Raising her face towards the light source she closed her eyes, basking in the fake sun. She knew in her head that it wasn't real but her heart lightened at being out of the darkness for even a little while and she could almost imagine being outside on a beautiful day before this nightmare had begun.<br>

Or at least she thought it was the way, all the while listening to Vania talk. She was kind of confused that the other girl was being so nice to her. <br>
<br>
At the mention of her appetite and getting something to eat, Taylee pushed the confusion away and smiled at the other girl. She was starving but was too embarrassed to mention it. 'Apparently my stomach wasn't though,' she thought, before Vania caught her attention again with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Ah! There it is. You will never taste anything better then this.

As the delicate scent of Chinese food wafted around her, Taylee closed her eyes briefly and took a deep breath. If it tasted half as good as it smelled Taylee figured she could die happy. <br>
<br>
As she heard Vania ask her <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;So, where are you from anyhow? Do you remember?&quot; </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Taylee quickly opened her eyes, blushing as she noticed the other girl watching her.<br>
Sliding into a chair she answered the question.  &quot;Ummm..well...I'm from the west coast,&quot; she didn't want to say exactly not knowing the other girl too well. 'Not that it matters in this new world,' Taylee thought remembering her family sadly. &quot;I was here...in New York...when things got...so bad. Then there was no way to get home,&quot; she paused for a minute thinking &quot;I wonder sometimes if it's this bad everywhere.&quot; Taylee picked up a fork and looked at it for a minute then put it down and looked up at Vania. &quot;How about you? Have you always lived here?&quot;<br>

<br>
Vania thought over what the girl just said then smiled softly, she did hope Taylea was correct in her theory. But she didn't know. Her voice was undertoned as she spoke, her eyes intent on Taylea.

&quot;The west coast eh? I have always wanted to go there. No I am not originally from here though. I was born in Russia. My parents left to come to America, and I was to meet them here. But by the time I arrived... New York had already fallen. I don't know what happened to my parents though. I like to think they perished in the war, and they are not one of these creatures outside. Though I will never know. Sometimes I do like to think that they are alive and well somewhere in the west. <br>
<br>
I wish I could confirm that New York is the worst, but sometimes we think we are the last. We have not recieved word from any other colony in the area, that they are surviving. I am sure though in my heart that there are still small groups out there somewhere, living day by day. Its my job to create a safe house for them. Hopefully we will have this city cleared out of vampires in the next year or so...&quot;<br>

She heard what the other girl was saying through a haze as her eyes became transfixed on the food in front of her. It had been so long since she'd seen a meal like this.<br>
<br>
Taylee reached out and took the fork Vania had placed in front of her, then slowly took a bite. As the flavor exploded in her mouth, she closed her eyes and sighed. Heaven. She'd been pulled out of hell and was now in heaven. Opening her eyes she looked over at the girl across from her, thinking...'but Vania's no angel.' A smile crossed her lips at that thought. No, angel's didn't carry the kind of weapons that girl had.<br>

<br>
As she finished, Taylee let out an audible sigh. She hadn't been able to finish half the food in front of her, and still she was so full she thought she'd never be able to move. Living on what you could scavenge while on the run didn't make for many 3 course meals. It was then she noticed the way Vania kept scanning the crowd, &quot;Is something wrong?

Taylee nodded and with a shrug turned a critical eye towards the offerings before her as she heard the rest of what Vania was saying, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;.....I can trust you not to leave the room?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Not bothering to turn back she answered, &quot;Where would I go?&quot; then moved to another rack of things. Her eyes skipped over clothes hastily, as she appraised them for possibilities, stopping occasionally to take a closer look. <br>
<br>
She picked up a pair of olive green drab camo pants and deciding they'd be a change from the black she usually wore, but yet concealing enough to blend into the shadows, lay them across her arm and continued on. <br>
<br>
Moving around to the other side of the rack her eyes stopped on a beautiful pale blue lace slip dress. Reaching up she brushed her fingers carefully over the soft material, momentarily wishing she could have something like this. Then with a sigh, Taylee moved on. There was nowhere in this world she could wear something like that, and it wouldn't do any good to wish things were different. Instead she grabbed a drab green ribbed tank that matched the pants, and a long sleeved dark brown soft flannel shirt. 'So much for fashion...,' she thought as she turned to head towards the changing room, '...but some things aren't worth getting killed over.' <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be right back,&quot; she said passing the other girl. As she went by she noticed the spider girl from earlier heading towards Vania,with a large wolf. <br>
<br>
Pulling the curtain across the opening of the changing room, Taylee turned and took the gun out of her pocket, inspecting it carefully for a minute to make sure there wouldn't be any surprises if she needed it. It wasn't that she expected trouble....well she always expected trouble. That was the only way to stay alive, these days....but she didn't totally trust that this council meeting that Vania was taking her to. What if those people turned on her? It was always better to be prepared.<br>
<br>
Satisfied that everything was in order she stuffed it back in the pocket and shrugged out of the leather coat. Next she toed off her boots and began removing her old clothes. She'd have to ask Vania if there was somewhere she could wash them later. After she'd changed, she looked into the mirror deciding these would be fine. Everything she had chosen would easily blend into the dark if she needed to escape.<br>
<br>
Bundling up her other clothes to take with her, she threw her leather coat back on and headed back out into the shop. Walking over to Vania, Taylee stopped beside her without interrupting, as she was now talking with Cynthia.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/8/03 1:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: war</span><hr size=1> (O.O.C.

George found getting past the guards easier done than said. The old throw-a-rock-and-they-will-follow-the-sound trick worked and George had easily slipped by when they went to check it out. From outside, George had noticed how bright it seemed but nothing had prepared him for the sight he saw. He was taken aback, not an easy feat for a guy with one good leg, at how dazzling the lights were. After his eyes adjusted slightly, George started moving about as best he could.<br>
<br>
Before he knew it, George found himself standing a few yards away from what looked like a clothing shop.  The reason he had stopped was standing right next to her protector, the same one who had saved her in the park. His first instinct was to go for his gun, which he almost followed. Then, looking around, George noticed the crowd. If any of them saw him pull a gun that could mean trouble he wasn’t ready to deal with just yet.<br>
<br>
With out completely knowing why, George started to limp towards the girl. Maybe he thought if he got close enough no one would notice the gun. The chance to try this never presented itself however, for, when he was a few feet away, somebody accidentally bumped up against his left leg, the one that was broken. A grunt escaping his lips, George tumbled and landed right at the feet of the ghoul. His eyes were closed and the only thought going through his brain was the pain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blindeserra@kalaberia>Blinde Serra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/9/03 4:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: war</span><hr size=1> He growls softly at her touch, a kind of rumbling wolf purr of pleasure, and trots behind her, following in her wake.

She noticed the large wolf beside Cynthia began to move closer to her drawing her attention from her surroundings and down to him. Watching cautiously as the beast bent his head down and sniffed at her feet, Taylea didn't notice the man heading towards them.<br>

Suddenly the man landed at her feet causing her to jump back in surprise. Taylea's hand went to the gun in her pocket as she took a defensive stance looking for trouble automatically. After realizing there was no immediate danger following the stranger she relaxed her grip and pulled her empty hand back out.<br>

Taylea looked down, noticing the man had his eyes closed, and a look of extreme pain on his face. Kneeling down, she put a hand on his arm trying to get his attention, &quot;Are you hurt?&quot; was all she could think to say to him.

Vania surveyed the man slowly, he was familiar but she couldn't place it. She merely shook her head and spoke a bit firmly, having no intention of inviting this man along, the council would already be angry enough with the number she would be bringing now, though she still had that sickening feeling that she would not be making it to the meeting. It took her a moment to actually speak though, pulling on Taylea and moving her away from the man, she did not trust him. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

&quot;I am afraid we do not have time to take care of you. Though if you continue down to the H corridor you will find a medical center. Come on Taylea, we have things to do. If you two are coming lets go.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Vania then adjusted her katana before pulling Taylea with her to exit the city, not giving her a chance to do much else. Though Vania did release her before pushing past the curtains, the endless stretch of black before them seeming as though it would sweep up and devour them.  For Vania that is what happened.<br>
<br>
She didn't scream, and with her last effort she kicked backwards, hoping to hit Taylea to keep her back. Blood spilled forth from Vania and dripped to the ground, the only thing revealing that anyone was ever there. Running could be heard, then the clatter of something metal, her sword, snapped in half and thrown to the corner in which the gaurds bodies lay dead. <br>
<br>
What the man had not known is the little time he had sent those gaurds away was time just enough for the vampires to get to them with out fear of being burned. It was then that a small girl began to scream in the distance of the city, her screams haunting, though how could she know? Her screams were of Vania's name, endless.<br>
<br>
Then everything seemed to grow hush as people looked from one another, they all seemed to have that sickening feeling, something was astray. It was then, everything seemed to hold still for what seemed an eternity then suddenly, black, everything was dark, the genorater off. No screams were heard, only the flutter of quick steps as they flooded the city streets.<br>
<br>
And then the power cut back on, the genoraters thrown full force, and the screams began, as what had to be at least 70 vampires burned and turned to ash before the city. Though the damage was done, for that instant was all they needed. The whole corridor seemed to have been wiped out clean, yet the were's were left untouched, along with the ghoul, and perhaps the man survived. Why? Fate would never reveal such a thing though. However who would ever suspect the council of shutting down the city to kill vampires easier, in mass, using those they save as bait.
