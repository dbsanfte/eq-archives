Her mother and father were killed when they were on the hunt, she honestly has no idea how. Her sister Kial went off on her own one day for a quick snack and never returned, her and her brother, Maolen looked for her for days. They never found her or a carcus so they don't know if she is alive or dead. Maolen and Nalocia basicly raised eachother into adolesence. They split up but promised they would meet again, so far that has not happened yet though, unfortunately. Nalocia found herself in Bree's land and met Queen Bree herself. They becamse fast friends. One day when she was out she chased a herd of Zebra, she did not know she had left the packlands. She was lost, and at that point had a whole life to lose. One day, when there was a bad storm she was still trying to find her way back when she met another lion. They fell in love and had six cubs, Palenzi, Denakai, Bakirtu, Nacido, Melocia, and Makenzi. Soon that lion changed and they decided to split up. It wasn't until she returned to Bree's that she realized that lion had been Mercaido, Bree's ex-mate. She felt ever so guilty. Bree and her remained very good friends, though. One day when she was froliking though a feild and being silly, like usual, She met a handsome lion name Maisha. They got along very well, he had a mate though, Angel. He told her that him and Angel didn't talk or do much at all. It was a bitter sweet moment when she found they had broken up, any friend of Maisha had to be lovely. After about a half a year she had fallen in love. She didn't tell for another three months...Maisha is still the hero of Nalci's dreams and they are now loving mates.</span></div> 		<div id="personalbio"><span class="title">Personal Bio ::</span> <span class="value">I am Nalocia, person and lioness.
