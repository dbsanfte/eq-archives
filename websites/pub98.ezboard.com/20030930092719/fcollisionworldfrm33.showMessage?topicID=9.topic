She put her hand on the cold steel of the ladder and began climbing up it.  Sobbing as she went, after several minutes she reached the top.  She pulled her self over, and gazed across the city into the orange sunset.  She looked and saw a mother in a lawn chair, two small children playing jacks at her feet.  Instantly, a flood of memories came gushing into her head.  She was sent back to a happier times, a time where she too played in front of her mother with her little brother.  She remembered the day it all happened, the sick crack of her brother’s legs as he fell.  She didn't mean to do what she did; it was... it was...she stopped herself.   But what could she have done to prevent it? She was so angry, angry at her mother for never being there.  She was angry at her responsibility; it seemed, to solve all the family's problems.  She needed to be a child, she was sick of it.  Sick of being the adult. She leaned over the top of the building and swallowed.  She new what she had to do.<br>
     But then she heard the children laughing.  She looked down and saw the three hug.  She knew she couldn't do what she intended.  She gazed out over the orange sky, and felt that somewhere out there was a person who, even though had caused her so much pain, loved her with all her heart.  A person who blamed themselves for everything Chloe had put her self through.  Chloe sighed and turned away, a sick smile on her face.  She trembled and fell to her knees, sobbing once more.<br>

She quietly moved out from hiding under a broken bill board, and stared across the roof.<br>
A girl is kneeling beside the top of the fire escape, wiping tears from her cheeks as they fall, one after another.<br>
Tari took a step, and as her foot scuffed the concrete the stranger looked up, eyes wide like a deer's.<br>
&quot;Um, are you alright?&quot;<br>
As soon as the words left her mouth, she realised how pointless they were.<br>
&quot;Can . . . can I help?&quot; she held out her hand to help the other girl to her feet.<br>

Her face flushed as she looked in the eyes of the girl.  She wiped her face and replied, <br>
     &quot;No, no....I'm fine thanks.&quot; <br>
Something about the stranger confused her, something else intrigued her, and perhaps it was the way she reached out to Chloe without even knowing her.  She blushed again, and looked at the ground.<br>
     &quot;So, uh...&quot; she started, still looking at the ground, &quot;what are you doing up here?&quot;<br>

     &quot;Well, um, actually...&quot; she paused, not knowing how to word her phrase.  &quot;I guess you could say my past.&quot;  She stopped and silently scolded herself for saying to much, shaking her head.  She fumbled desperately for a new topic.<br>

Chloe was sure her friendship with Tari was actually going to last. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blake@collisionworld>Blake</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(8/2/03 9:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rooftops</span><hr size=1> Tari led Chloe down onto the street. The two of them wandered, picked up food from the back of restaurants and watched TV in an electrical shop window. The last of the sunlight died and the moon rose.<br>
Chloe smiled constantly, and Tari couldn't help but grin. Inwardly she was singing, &quot;not on my own, not on my own,&quot; over and over. Everything about this girl was wonderful. Tari hoped she wasn't dreaming the whole thing.<br>
<br>
It was in the park that things went wrong. On the way back to Tari's rooftop, Chloe spotted a small group of teens throwing knives into trees out of boredom.<br>
Tari motioned for Chloe to move back into the shadows. But Tari's foot caught on a tree root, and she tumbled loudly backwards.<br>
One of the boys looked up and saw them.<br>
Tari swore, scrambling to her feet. They couldn't outrun all of the gang. She wildly looked to Chloe for help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ayscandie>ayscandie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(8/11/03 4:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rooftops</span><hr size=1> Chloe's swiftly turned around, her eyes wide and blazing with fear.  Her heart pounded with anxiety as the group headed towards them, knives drawn and ready to play.  She planted her feet firmly on the ground,  and out of sheer instinct grabbed Tari's hand for comfort.  The boys in the gang circled them.  Chloe's eyes darted from side to side.  <br>
<br>
     &quot;What would you two lovely ladies be doing alone in a place like this?&quot; smirked the boy who had spotted them.  Chloe was getting angry already, and the voice in the back of her head had already begun to mumble in it's own distinctive language.  She looked helplessly at Tari, hoping she would know what to say and do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blake@collisionworld>Blake</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(8/13/03 7:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rooftops</span><hr size=1> &quot;Uhm . . . &quot; Tari gripped Chloe's hand tighter and said intelligently, &quot;Nothing.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nothing?&quot; the boy, seemingly the leader, raised an eyebrow. &quot;So you'd have time to . . . &quot; he smirked at his friends, &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>socialise</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.&quot;<br>
Tari thought about their options. They could run, and get outrun. They could scream, but no one whould hear them who would care. They could try and talk their way out of things, but she doubted she'd manage that alone.<br>
There was always violence, but with the boy's knives that didn't look promising.<br>
&quot;Socialise?&quot; She rambled frantically, &quot;Uhm, actually we have quite a hectic, er, schedule as it is, so maybe we could take a raincheck on that social thing, kay?&quot;<br>
This was met with silence, then the leader sniggered. On cue, the rest of the boys laughed loudly.<br>
&quot;Raincheck? But <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>we're</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> free now, aren't we?&quot;<br>
Tari looked across at the other girl, whispering, &quot;How are you with your fists Chloe?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ayscandie>ayscandie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(8/27/03 4:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rooftops</span><hr size=1> &quot;Um.. fists?&quot; Chloe stuttered &quot;I dunno...&quot; Her voice trailed off.

She didn't want to risk her new friend Tari seeing the that part of her, her deep dark secret.  She knew it would probably scare her away.  The boy stepped towards them.  Chloe's grip on Tari's hand loosened.  Her eyes rolled backwards into her head...

A strange sound was whispering from behind her clenched teeth, something like a voice but as yet without words.<br>
Tari knew she didn't want to listen long enough to understand what the voice was saying.<br>
Chloe was sweating, her eyes had rolled back to the whites.<br>
The boys were glancing at each other, wide eyed and nervous.<br>
&quot;Look what you've done!&quot; Tari yelled, her voice cracking.<br>
Chloe jerked, lunging toward the first boy as if against her will. He screamed, turning and running as his gang scattered from her. The inhuman mutters and wails coming from something inside Chloe were enough to make Tari's blood run cold.<br>
&quot;Chloe, what is it? What's happening to you?&quot;<br>
The other girl just sank to her knees, her head tilting backwards. As the boys fled with their fear and their hatred, the fit seemed to be passing.<br>
&quot;Chloe?

Tears rolled down her cheeks.  &quot;I'm...I'm sorry&quot; she stuttered.  Her head seared in pain.  She covered her face with her hands, sobbing.  &quot;I'm sorry...I can't help it...I just...&quot; She lost her words.  She looked back at Tari, expecting the worst.<br>
