Crow looked up, yet again.  &quot;Oh... It hardly ever repeats things twice, one after another like that.  S' quite weird, actually.  I mean, the only other time it did that was when I was wandering around the countryside and it told me to get off the train tracks in both languages like what you just heard- Uhh,&quot; Crow said, pausing.  He didn't want to relate the consequences of his not following the 3i's directions for fear he might incur Derla's doubts again, so he changed the subject.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soooo... Anything else you know about hi-&quot;<br>
<br>
Crow stopped again, his 3i widening noticibly.  The gold there gleamed with inner light.  &quot;You're thinking of doing something and it's making me really nervous,&quot; he said, staring at her.  His weapon lay across his knees, glinting.<br>

Well..&quot; I can't lie, I'm not a good liar... What do I do??? She turned her back to him. &quot;I just was rearrainging some seeds..that's all. These plants are like my best friends sometimes... Are you saying that the 3i is telling you there's danger nearby? Shouldn't we do something??&quot; She turned back to him to see that he had not removed his gaze. She hung her head in shame. &quot;I'm sorry for scaring you...&quot; She whispered patheticlly, laying the seeds on the table. 'He's gonna kill me now.. I just know it... But why do I care? Him or Kage? It doesn't matter.. not anymore...' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 242<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/24/03 10:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm Still Here!</span><hr size=1> Crow broke into a grin.  &quot;Yeah.  The 3i only works when it's open, though... It can detect an opponent's future moves, but not very well... And it's inconsistent, besides.&quot;<br>
Finished with his notes, and unaware of Derla's resigned mood, Crow leaned back in his seat and put his heels up on the edge of the chair, lowering the synteshart to the floor beside him with a soft clatter.<br>
&quot;I can usually close it when I want, but sometimes it has its own way with me.&quot;  He peered at the girl, still huddled somewhat behind the desk, acting slightly guilty.  He tapped his forehead.  &quot;See?  I'd feel it if there really was danger lurking around.  The voice always does this.  Just trust me!&quot;  He laughed, and folded his arms across his knees.<br>
<br>
He continued gazing at her.  &quot;...Is there still something wrong?&quot;<br>

Oh.. It's nothing.&quot; She went to the seat across from Crow and sat down quietly. &quot;Crow? Would you believe me if I told you that you are one of the first people to even speak to me kindly? And what would you say if I said I didn't want you involved for your own good?&quot; She turned towards the door, suddenly and without warning. &quot;Something's wrong... The wind's not right... The flowers are upset...&quot; She went to the door and made sure it was locked before peeking out the spy hole. &quot;How strange... No one's there... I could've sworn...&quot; She stopped and listened. Silience, heavy and blaring, settled on the shop. &quot;Silience before the storm...&quot; She whispered the old charm from habit. A slight breeze whisped through the shop from the green house area. She glanced at Crow, as if waiting for an okay... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 247<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/24/03 10:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm Still Here!</span><hr size=1> <br>
<br>
Crow, still tucked up in the chair, suddenly lurched forward.  His 3i abruptly shut itself, and Crow, in a smoother movement than before, leaned down and grabbed the synteshart.<br>
&quot;Thanks for your concern, but seriously, I'm not going to leave you alone,&quot; Crow told Derla, smiling despite the fact that the 3i had once again opened and was spouting what sounded like gibberish to Derla's ears.<br>
&quot;Well, I guess the flowers never lie.  It's time to get out of here, Derla!&quot; Crow continued, hoisting his weapon over his shoulder.  There was a large nick in the floor where it had struck the surface.  <br>

Crow, for the first time during his whole encounter with Derla, looked positively paralyzed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gah... School girls?!  Oh my- Dahhh- Argh!!&quot;  Crow put his hands to his head and nearly decapitated himself with the synteshart.  &quot;No offense, but I don't think I have to point out to you that there is almost no way for me to blend in with ANYONE.  No crowd whatsoever can conceal this-&quot; He indicated his semi-opaque hair, &quot;and this stupid thing-&quot; Here he jabbed a forefinger at the glowing 3i, still open on his forehead.<br>
<br>
His mind finally registered Derla's other option, which would be following him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooer...&quot;  He thought as quickly as he could.  3i 3i 3i... Be useful for once...<br>
<br>
Silence from the attic.  Crow snapped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right then!!  C'mon, Derla.  We're making a break for it!!&quot;  He grabbed Derla's arm (carefully!!) and began making his way towards the door.<br>

P.S. Kerri, Could you make a place over there and continue off?<br>
