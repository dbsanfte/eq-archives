I say so-called because the vast majority of peace our country has obtained has been through war. The war of independence, the civil war, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and a good number of smaller actions over the past century. To have peace one must be prepared to wage war, and must be damn good at waging war to encourage that peace. <br>
<br>
Yet in all the protesting, in America and abroad, something was very noticable. There was not a single sign protesting Saddam Hussein. There was not a single sign demanding Iraq disarm for peace. Instead, the ire was all directed at America, and specifically, our republican president George W Bush. This raises an interesting question, and I have a habit of looking for interesting questions.<br>
<br>
Where were these worldwide peace protests when we were raining missiles and bombs down on Serbia? Where were these worldwide peace protests when (in 1998 )  Bill Clinton ordered the firing of over 450 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>CRUISE</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> missiles into Iraq? Where were these protests when we sailed an invasion fleet right up to Haiti? Where were these protests when we expanded a humanitarian mission into a nation-building mission in Somalia?<br>
<br>
We did all of these things through our military might, not through the UN. We only sought marginal UN support afterwards, we did not sit around waiting for UN resolutions authorizing use of force against Slobodan Milosevic. Yet there was no world outcry about U.S. warmongering and imperialism.<br>
<br>
Why? <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Why?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> What is different? What has changed? An interesting question.<br>
<br>
A clue is in the nature of the protests, where Bush is singled out as the villain of the day. He is compared to Hitler, yet no such comparison is made of Saddam Hussein to Hitler. It's telling.<br>
<br>
It's telling because the worldwide protesters are not protesting war, because if so they would have protested Clinton's military actions listed above. Rather they are protesting a Republican president, and a war that will occur under a conservative's watch. <br>
<br>
On the surface, this doesn't make any sense. The world at large knows little about the different American political parties, one American politician should be seen like another. Yet why isn't President Bush getting the reaction President Clinton got when he was bombing Serbia? Was it all image? And what is the image of the Republican president?<br>
<br>
There is a very definite image of the Republican president, loudly and proudly proclaimed to the world by his political opponents over the last three years. For three years, the Democratic party has announced to the world that Bush is a dunce, he's poorly-spoken, that he's corrupt, that he's a puppet for Cheney and others. This partisan campaign, done solely to win elections, has hurt the image of our country abroad.<br>
<br>
We saw it when Bush went to Europe, and there were the same protesters out there protesting his refusal to sign the Kyoto environmental accords. They had read and seen and heard what the American left had said about Bush, and were protesting him, not America. (Although It helps that America is also hated for its economic excellence. So much for principles.) <br>
<br>
I recall last year an interview with Nelson Mandela, where he stated it is common knowledge that Bush has low intelligence. Where did he come by this information? From the Democratic Party.<br>
<br>
Clinton acted unilaterally on many occasions. Clinton acted without congressional approval on many occasions. And Clinton did not secure UN approval for a single military mission, only bothering with it after the fact as a formality. And not a whisper of protest from these crowds that are all over television today. And that returns to the question, why? Because he was not a Republican.<br>
<br>
Read the signs, &quot;Drop Bush Not Bombs&quot;, &quot;Regime Change in US&quot;, and so forth. You'll see not a single sign condemning Saddam Hussein for anything. Yes, telling indeed.<br>

<br>
From the perspective of a European who doesn't watch american news on a regular basis, the image i've received of Bush is someone who is lacking diplomacy, and is very bad at effective improvisation making him a less than capable politician.<br>
<br>
Bush has a hard time reacting under pressure, the interview where he mangled the 'fool me once' quote is a veryu public example of this. His so call bushisms, such as 'misunderestimating' things don't help that image.<br>
<br>
His lack of large scale political experience is a well documented fact.<br>
<br>
Those two things combine to create an image of a poorly spoken bufoon who has no idea how to run a country, trying to impose his will on the world.<br>
<br>
regardless of the right or wrongs of that statement, it is the common perception of him, and in the game of presidents, perception is everything.<br>
<br>
Many people are also asking the question, why now? to which he has provided no satisfactory answer. Why not two years ago, why not before september 11 (and can i just say how much i hate that cutesy 911 date stamp)<br>
<br>
at this point it almost doesn't matter that he has turned a large treasury surpluss into a defecit, or that he is considered to be so contemptible as a president that other world leaders are being as obstinate and cruel as they are.<br>
<br>
What matters, is that as the leader of America, he has, in my view, failed as a leader of economy, politics and international relationships.<br>
<br>
but, as i said, these are just my impressions<br>

<br>
As a European, I trust playing politics isn't a new concept where you're from. Americans didn't invent it, but we've embraced it. There isn't a grain of truth to their claims. It's just the willingness to say anything to win elections. (This strategery backfired on our Democrats rather badly in the 2002 election.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>From the perspective of a European who doesn't watch american news on a regular basis, the image i've received of Bush is someone who is lacking diplomacy, and is very bad at effective improvisation making him a less than capable politician.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Yes, thank you! I agree completely, our president tells you the truth, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>fuck diplomacy!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Man, it should be a refreshing change to see an honest president for a change, who shoots from the hip and tells you the honest truth no matter how undiplomatic it is.<br>
<br>
I'll give you a perfect example. President Clinton signed the Kyoto accords. He was hailed as the champion of eternity by our friends in Europe. The U.S. Senate (which approves treaties) voted 92-0 against ratifying it. It would never have become law. <br>
<br>
Clinton signed it because he knew it had no chance of passing, and he would be hailed as the greatest guy who ever lived. A win-win scenario in his book. Never mind that it would never get passed, the bottom line is that he could lie and get praised for it.<br>
<br>
Now we switch to President Bush. President Bush also knows the U.S. Senate would not ratify such an industry-killing treaty. Bush went to Europe, and said so. Oh my god, what an incredible display of protesting! Bush was the enemy of the planet, Bush would blow up the world, he was the ultimate monster. On and on and on and on.<br>
<br>
For what? Telling the truth. The truth his predecessor had no intention of stating. And look where the two men are today in European opinion. Clinton is positioning himself as the friend of Europe, he's beloved wherever he goes, and Bush is hated as the ultimate Nazi. His crime? He's a truthful person. <br>
<br>
So yes, Bush is no diplomat. The French and German leaders? They are diplomats extraordinaire. But don't expect those weasels to tell the truth.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> His so call bushisms, such as 'misunderestimating' things don't help that image.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Mispeaking is not a crime, it happens. I daresay there is a large collection of such mistakes for any leader or any president. As Bush has proven, if that's the worse his opponents can say about him, he's doing pretty good.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>His lack of large scale political experience is a well documented fact.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Actually, it's absolutely not a well-documented fact. Bush was governor of a very large state (larger than most European countries) that had over a thousand miles of border with a foreign country, Mexico. He knows all about international relations. He also knows the essential truth of diplomacy, that if you give them the chance, others will walk all over you. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>regardless of the right or wrongs of that statement, it is the common perception of him, and in the game of presidents, perception is everything.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I readily agree its a perception. What Saddam Hussein fails to understand is that it's a lie.<br>
<br>
Let me mention an early foreign policy success by Bush, one the critics said he had no chance of winning. Bush was adamant to the Russians that we would proceed with missile defense (SDI) research. Putin was said to be intransigent. When Bush went to meet with him personally, the criticism rose in volume to a howl. They said Bush the dunce would get severely trounced, they said he'd be put in his place. What happened? Bush and Putin became friends, and found they were able to work together. SDI became a minor issue for diplomats to squabble over. Bush proved his critics wrong.<br>
<br>
I could point to many other examples, but bottom line is that the Democratic party of this country nearly destroyed itself believing the lie. They had told themselves so often that Bush was a dummy that they began to believe. And as a result, Republicans control the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. Now Bush's world critics have placed themselves in the same position. They readily believe the Democrat lies, it fits in with their anti-American propaganda. And just like the Democrats, they're about to find out that they can't depend on the lie. Bush is going to run rings around his critics abroad.<br>

I would also like to thank Ogami for placing this here for me to vent the following.<br>
<br>
Fuck Europe.<br>
<br>
Fuck the peace protesters.<br>
<br>
&quot;No blood for oil&quot;, my ass.  If America had wanted the oil, why didn't we take it the last time?  Fuck you and your cliche-ridden asses.  I've had it.  The next time I see protesters on the sides of the street with their &quot;pithy&quot; signs, I'm going to stop my car, roll down my window and flip them off.  I hate them.  But, why not just wait until Saddam uses a weapon of mass destruction?  I know that Saddam won't be using it against France, as they are selling him supplies.  <br>
<br>
But, I'd love to see them get the first of them.  &quot;Well France, we'd like to help, but first we want you to go on the public record and admit how much of an ass-monkey the lot of you are.  That and I want you to apologize to the world  for being such an ass-monkey.&quot;  Fuck you, you bunch of fucking handing-jews-over-to-the-Nazis ass-hats.  Collaborators are just as bad as those that they are collaborating with.  If you lay in shit, you can always use obnoxious amounts of cologne to cover up the smell.  <br>
<br>
I had a lot of reasonably written things typed up.   But decided against it, because why be reasonable with these people.  I'd much rather that they pull up this post and say, &quot;Oh, look at how conservatives think.&quot;  Use this as proof that conservatives are evil if you will.

Fine, we'll judge the modern collaborators with evil on their own merits. Not a single one of those windbags marched to protest Saddam Hussein's inhumanity to his own people or the Kurds. Where were these wine-soaked morons then? They disgrace themselves by declaring their solidarity with &quot;peace loving&quot; Iraq, and their contempt for America. <br>
<br>
America feeds the world, we have programs in every country whose sole purpose is to help people. President Bush announced last week <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>$15 billion for AIDS funding in Africa.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> You know what one of the African leaders said? It's not enough. The whole continent hasn't seen a GNP of $15 billion in their whole existence, yet they spit on our money. And then they call our president a dummy and us evil. <br>

After World War II, France ordered all U.S. military personnel out of their country, our bases closed. This is consistent with their modern track record of ingratitude. As our secretary of state put it at the time, should we dig up our buried dead at Normandy and take them home, too?<br>

Total economic war should be declared against both of these countries. Bribe their best computer scientists and auto engineers to come to our country. Embargo all goods that they deem crucial in their trade. As our leaders declared in 1802 when France demanded tribute money, &quot;Millions for defense, not one penny for tribute.&quot;<br>
<br>
Godeskian, I don't hate Europeans at all, I am quite happy to see the majority of European countries siding with the U.S. on Iraq. That includes all of the former Soviet Republics. They remember what an absolute dictator like Saddam Hussein is like, they lived under such leaders for decades. They know what evil is, but the French have apparently forgotten.<br>

<br>
First of all, thank you.<br>
<br>
I knew the stuff about France.  Frankly, I'm surprised that Godeskian didn't say anything about their current collaboration with Saddam.  That's what I was really talking about with the France collaborating with Nazis.  To show a connection between what France did then and what they are doing now.  But, leave it to me, to not make my point 100% clear.<br>
<br>
They may not be handing over Kurds to the Iraqi government right now, but what would happen if the Iraqi army was standing on their borders today?  I'm just pointing out possible correlations.  Things that if the world forgets about, then where do we end up then?  Here in America, white Americans are under constant scrutiny by minority groups for the sins of their (fore)fathers.  I don't think it's right, but as a &quot;minority&quot;, I claim the same right that they do, only I'm not aiming my venom inwards.  I'm tired of suffering other people's shit with a smile.  But, if this proves how ridiculous their argument sounds, I've done my part.<br>
<br>
One thing though, what I was intending was to regarding the &quot;Fuck Europe&quot; statement was not one of hatred.  No, in all honesty, I could care less regarding Europe.  They are in a day to day fashion below my notice.  It's only under the constant drudgery in which the media portrays Europe as important.  What once was a grand empire, what once held some cultural merit as the birthplace of other nations, is no longer.  I, for one, am tired of the thought that the european nations hold any real value.  But then, I feel the same way about most of America.  <br>
<br>
What I'm saying is this, Fuck the European peace protesters.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Fuck France's peace protesters.  I am not against peace.  I'm against people declaring the need for peace in the face of an evil as great as Saddam poses.  <br>
<br>
He is not the type of leader that I would want in charge of a country.  In a country where he claims to have received a &quot;100% of the vote.&quot;  In a country where U.N. resolutions have clearly been found in violation of earlier treaties.   A country that the United States of America decided to ignore under the thumb of a liberal president.  A liberal president that was so popular that his vice-president  couldn't get elected by the same or close to the same popularity that his predecessor had. <br>
<br>
The revolution will not be televised.  Because there isn't going to be one.<br>

<br>
When they willingly help a dictator like Saddam Hussein, these protesters have declared themselves enemies of humanity, and enemies of peace. These protesters are like chess players who never think more than one move ahead. The surest way to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>war</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is to give Saddam Hussein hope to hold out. The surest way to peace is to show Saddam Hussein he is isolated and the world holds him accountable for getting rid of those weapons, not inspectors.<br>
<br>
The protesters give succor and comfort to a blood-soaked dictator. They must be awful proud of themselves.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>why the hell isn't america going to a few dozen other countries with oppressive regimes where people are routinely murdered and tortured.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The answer can be read in the Bob Woodward book <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bush at War.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Donald Rumsfeld and the president have seen Saddam Hussein as a threat that would not diminish with time, they viewed him as a threat to world security from the moment they took office. <br>
<br>
The president was very clear in his language when he stated that we would take the 'War on Terrorism' to any country that harbored terrorists, or funded terrorism. Iraq fits that bill, even if not a single Al Queda member ever set foot in the country.<br>
<br>
As for a reason for going into Iraq, let's step back a moment and look at what's happened in a year's time. Bush said we needed to force Saddam Hussein to disarm, we were talking regime change. The critics said we have to go to the UN first, how dare we act unilaterally. Bush went to the UN. The critics said we have to have inspectors on the ground, there are inspectors on the ground. The critics said Bush had to consult with congress first, how dare he act unilaterally. Bush consulted with congress, and won authorization for force from both parties.<br>
<br>
The critics made every one of these demands, as if it were essential. These demands have all been met, and the critics protest and scream and shout that it's not enough. This only proves the critics were liars, scum bent on siding with Saddam Hussein, and it didn't matter what Bush or the U.S. did.<br>
<br>
We could have mounted a military operation last summer. How much more time has Saddam been given to prepare? How many more Allied soldiers will die because of the time Iraq was given? Those added deaths will be on the heads of those who demanded we wait. That blood will be on their hands.<br>
<br>
Those are the people I criticize, and I am fighting mad they still protest and jeer and curse and spit when President Bush has done everything asked of him by the critics. It proves nothing will satisfy them, because they never viewed Saddam as the enemy. I hope Bush's team has finally realized that.<br>
