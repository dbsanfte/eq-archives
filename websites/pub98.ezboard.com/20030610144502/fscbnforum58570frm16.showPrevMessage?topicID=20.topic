However, its going to involve some minor changes in several areas to the status system. I’ll go into roughly what we’re propsing to change and what we’re suggesting should stay the same.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What is staying the same:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How status is viewd in the game from a player standpoint.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How temporary status works in attacks, loans, etc.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How Permanent status is represented in the game.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The amount of status someone is given in the game for officer positions.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What would be changing:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What status titles are given with offices.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How status is given out/determined.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Status as a more accurate reflection of a person’s actual reputation or outward appearance.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Addition of negative status traits.<br>
 <br>
Many people have complained that status doesn’t really mean much. The primary reason for this that the status traits really don’t reflect how people feel about that character. Not all Primogen are revered and not all Seneschals are cherished. So why play a trait that really isn’t a part of your character? Kirstin and I have worked really hard to start revising status lto more accurately reflect the way people actually may feel about certain people.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What is a negative status trait?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
This is a status trait that reflects you doing something unpopular. It is actually a permanent status trait that can only be lost through work and redeeming yourself. Its impact is fairly profound however. Every negative status trait you have reduces your temporary status pool by that amount. So for example, if you are Acknowledged, (Hated), you essentially have no status to attack, lend, or do anything with. You are still technically acknowledged, but your Hated flaw makes it kind of worthless in many people’s eyes. Similarly, Bob the Vampire has Revered, Powerful, Connected, Untrusted. He’s still very powerful, but he only acts at 2 temporary status traits instead of 3. So yes, it is possible to attack a powerful Kindred by keeping their permanent status intact, but reducing their status power, but giving them a bad rep and assigning negative status traits.<br>
 <br>
This is how you get a leader who is appears powerful, but actually has little power because of reputation. This is how a paper prince would be – someone who had no power. If Marie for example got 4 negative status traits stacked against her, she would be ineffective in setting status. At this point she would have no choice but to relinquish her position on the status council, perhaps, to show her voice no longer has any power.<br>
 <br>
Otherwise, status bidding and temporary, permanent status still works the same as it currently does in the game. Negative traits do affect your pool however.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>So how is office with status going to change?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
Not in a terribly complex way. When you attain an office in the city, you simply gain the same number of status traits you do now, but you gain them in personalized adjectives that apply directly to your character’s methods, motives, and outward appearance. For example, Grifon attains the post of Senschal. He should normally get the “Cherished” and “Esteemed” status trait, right? Well, those really don’t reflect Grifon’s manners or how people view him. Instead, its decided that Grifon will get the “Feared” and “Efficient” traits instead so that its more reflective of how people view him.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How would status be determined differently?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
Well, we know we already have the harpies in place. Towards this end, once a month the Harpy PCs will chair a “Status Council”. The Status Council consists of all the city’s officers, plus the Prince, plus the Harpies themselves. This is a semi-OOC council that accurately reflects the feelings of those with status. The Prince and the Harpies both bring separate lists to the Council, of Kindred they wish to assign negative or positive status to. Similarly, those lists include any status they believe deserves to be stripped due to recent activities that Kindred may have done. Each change is addressed in turn, and then voted on by the members of the council – yes or no. Every member of the Council has 1 vote, save the Prince, who has 2. Similarly, in events where the same Kindred has been recommended for a certain status, the Prince is the final arbiter of which status is assigned. A kindred may never acquire more than 1 negative or 1 positive status trait per status council under normal circumstances.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Examples:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 <br>
Estelle and Keith bring their lists to the status council. Marie also has her list. The meeting begins with the Prince going first. She suggests that Cybel, the Nosferatu be given the positive “Adored” trait. She states her reasons for it and then the vote is cast. Estelle, Keith, Alia, and Trevor all vote “no” because they think its not reflective of how the city views her. Prophet, Marie, and Grifon vote “yes”. It’s a tie. The Prince breaks all ties, UNLESS both harpies agree to a certain vote opposite hers. In this case, Keith and Estelle both agreed “No” so the motion doesn’t pass.<br>
 <br>
However, lets say for example that Keith and Estelle both had Cybel down on their list to get the positive status trait “Helpful”. Well, in this case, the vote comes up to simply “award Cybel status”. If the vote passes, then the Prince chooses which status Cybel gets and the Prince decides “Adored”.<br>
 <br>
If someone is awarded positive status, they cannot be awarded negative status in the same council. Negative status is counted as either the removal of a current status trait or the addition of a negative status trait to a person’s sheet. The Primogen’s votes are not counted in the council primarily because they are supposed to influence status through the Harpies and the Harpies are permitted to sit in by the strength of the Primogen’s backing.<br>
 <br>
An individual can vote in their own status raising or lowering if they sit on the Council. This would make it more difficult for someone to simply railroad a powerful, respected individual’s status. Members of the Council are only allowed to cast their votes and make their suggestions for raises and lowers. All debate and Roleplay surrounding the creation of the lists should actually go on prior to the Status Council casting their votes on the matter.<br>
 <br>
So long as the officers of the city retain their position they can never lose the status trait(s) they acquired when attaining that position though they can attain a number of negative traits to make their word in the city all but ineffective. So if you want to discredit someone, attack them with negative traits! A suggestion can be made to change that status trait to something else, so long as the status trait still reflects the power of the office. Lets say for example Grifon goes soft-hearted all of a sudden, and well, the Feared trait doesn’t really apply to him anymore. Marie can suggest “Benevolent” perhaps instead and this change is made in the Status Council. The powers of the Prince on the Status Council are outlined below.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How will status council work?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
To speed things up, status council will be done in the form of a ballot. At the end of the night on the 4th week of the month, the harpies and the Prince will exchange their list of status raises/lowers/changes. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NOTE: If the harpies do not submit their list that night or during the next week, the Prince will simply name her list and she alone will be dictating the status of the populace. At this point the populace needs to take note that the harpies aren’t doing their job and well, this might anger some people who want a voice in status, right? This is the harpies responsibility and if they fail it, they will probably be removed.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The prince will take a week to compile this list into a ballot and on the 1st Friday of the month distribute it to the voters, who will cast their vote, yes or no and turn the ballots in. The 2nd Friday of the month at the start of game, status changes will be announced and people have 3 weeks to RP on those changes or attempt to get them modified. On /rare/ occasions the status council may meet personally in a semi-OOC fashion to discuss things.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What powers does the Prince retain over status?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Prince still retains the power to add or remove the “acknowledged” status from a Kindred at any time. The Prince can also offer “bounty status” as a reward for distinguished service or particular dedication. Bounty status counts against positive status for the month, but cannot be refuted in Status Council unless some evidence arises to contradict that individual’s heroic or distinguished actions. The Prince determines what makes “bounty status”, and if its frivolous things, then no doubt his/her status could be attacked and a negative trait assigned that would make assigning that status more difficult.<br>
<br>
The Prince’s permanent status is iron-clad. Because cities in the Camarilla need and require a strong leader, vampire society itself very rarely seeks to make a weak leader. However, an unpopular Prince may begin to find their power over the city undermined by a series of negative traits.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Example:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Samuel is considered to be Famous, Well-Known, Commanding, and Just. However, he begins to grow unpopular with the people and the populace (through the harpies) attacks his status by saying that he’s getting a bit too aloof. So he earns the negative trait “Aloof” if enough agree that is the case. This could go on to the point where Samuel has no effective status left and he is removed from the Council entirely. At this point the city’s status is in the hands of the officers and the harpies (the populace) and things can degrade even further from there for Sam.<br>
<br>
The Prince’s status is also influenced heavily by the status of the Camarilla. For excellent service as a Prince, many Camarilla Princes are awarded much status and acclaim, and thereby power. The more respected you are the more likely you are to receive help, advice, and favors from other cities.<br>

<br>
The main problem with status is how to balance the OOC and IC aspects of it.  What part of it should be played out and what part of it do folks dicker and dither about out of character.<br>
<br>
Ideally, status should be something that characters reflexively react to, the same as &quot;eerie presence&quot; or &quot;gorgeous&quot;, yes the player may need to announce it, but *characters* should not be quite so consciously aware that it is a currency that can be bought sold and traded.  A character may feel that they deserve more respect, but they shouldn't know that they have been assigned a *trait*.  A character may be completely unaware in game that they are considered &quot;cherished&quot; by the population, until everyone in game comes to their defense when they are in trouble.<br>
This may seem a little confusing to people.<br>
But what it comes down to is how people play the *character*.<br>
The combination of motivations, concept, merits and flaws should build a personality and entity that illicits a certain response from other characters.<br>
This is what makes the difference between LARP and table-top... the potential to explore these interactions and responses.<br>
Coming up with a way to balance this ideal and the actual practical application of game mechanics is a work in progress.<br>
John and Kirie have come up with some good ideas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nesuril>Nesuril</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/21/03 3:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Status Revisions (Suggestions)</span><hr size=1> Agree one hundred percent with you there Marisa about how status needs to be a complete picture of a character and that is an extension of how the player plays it. Your character could be the most competent and wise character on paper, but if you play him like a fool, expect people to regard him with that status. Ideally status should be an extension of RP alone and not attributes on a sheet. One of the things Kirstin and I attempted to do was to &quot;humanize&quot; the status system and put it in terms that were more directly related to the way people play, rather than some obscure term like &quot;Revered&quot;. For example, Keith is a very &quot;Suave&quot; character. That's a positive trait and its reflective of Ken's RP style with that character.<br>
<br>
I think by getting people more into a humanized status system, that process will eventually grow into the kind of &quot;thoughtless&quot; status that Marisa has described. The fact is, status has for a long time been a kind of nebulous entity in the Santa Carla LARP. Some people have abused it for their own gain and even powergamed with status (from rumors). People should learn to have fun with a system of status and the status system should reflect actual RP goings-on rather than projected super-heroic images of characters that aren't RP'd out. I hope this suggestion will try to bring to the fore-front aspects of characters that people maybe are overlooking and should or should not play either for or against those characters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=antoineleblanc@scbnforum58570>Antoine leblanc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/21/03 6:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Status Revisions (Suggestions)</span><hr size=1> you call a judge &quot;Your Honor&quot; even if the judge isn't honorable.

Second, I would like to point out some counter-arguments to some of the propositions.<br>
<br>
1. And I think this should always be the first thing a person thinks of when they think about status: Prestation. Status determines the worth of the currency that is prestation. If John Q. Brujah who just rolled in last week wants a favor from Justicar Ba'Dass with 7 accounts of Feared, John might have to exchange a Major or Blood Boon for even a Minor Boon (but probably not a trivial, depending on negotiations, etc.). This works the other way around, John Q. might be expected to dish out something major in exchange for something not so big.<br>
<br>
2. Status is not what Kindred actually think of each other. If that were the case, they would all think of each other as ravening beasts out to destroy each other, because that's what most of them, especially the Elders with the most status are. Instead, it is the force of vampiric society: a person plays the game, gets boons and if they blackmail the right people, they will eventually get status.<br>
<br>
3. I don't recommend using the negative status trait system. It's been used in this game before and it only makes things more complicated without really adding anything. I recommend just stripping people of status. If you want a paper prince, I suggest simply making it appear like what they are saying is being carried out, and find an alternate way of actually exerting power as opposed to relying on the status system.<br>
<br>
4. &quot;Semi-OOC&quot; has come up before with bad results to inter-player relationships. What you are suggesting seems to be entirely IC to me and should be swayed by character opinions and agendas, not some concept of fairness. In this way, intrigue and politics become the focus.<br>
<br>
5. Losing status is easy if a Kindred isn't careful (which is why the harpies aren't killed outright, they carry the power to instantly erase years of work). Gaining status is tough. LotN (or the Cam) mentions 1 positive status per story and unlimited status loss, and I would reaffirm the importance of that. A story, as far as I can tell, usually takes longer than a month.<br>
<br>
6. Cam cities are not &quot;nice.&quot; Elders are all the same, no matter sect. Vampire society never seeks to make a leader, only individual vampires do. The status system was developed much like the sects; to keep the powerful powerful and to keep the younger vampires under their sires' fingers. As such, it does not support a strong leader intrinsically, in fact almost the opposite. A strong leader uses the system to their own advantage and bends and creates rules that suit them in such a way that the other vampires in the area don't get upset.<br>
<br>
7. Reacting to status like &quot;Eerie Presence.&quot; I disagree. A player may use one dot of their character's Politics ability to determine the status traits of ONE vampire whose name they know. This means that most vampires do not have their city's population's status memorized unless status was not given out like water. If it took years to gain status, then everyone (all 6 or 7 Kindred in a normal-sized domain) would be able to keep track. On the other hand, I think any neonate who's had more than a few months of training would know exactly how much status is a currency, though maybe not what it is worth.<br>
<br>
8. Just to be clear, I don't think status has anything to do with personality neccessarily. Assuming that status, the currency of vampiric meetings, represents acknowledgement of social charm and character strengths implies that it is these things which are most valuable to vampires. If this were the case, the Sabbat would not exist, nor the anarchs, the Assamites, etc. etc. What is most important to a vampire is far darker and is generally feeding and staying in control. These two things are threatened by every other vampire in the same city, which is where status comes in. It is a way for vampires to deal with each other on vampiric terms, not a judgement of how cool Ken's shoes are (very cool, I would add).<br>
<br>
I hope I have presented my arguments clearly and concisely in a way which is useful and constructive. I assume it is understood, but I would like to mention that I am not attacking anyone, although I may be arguing, and if my tone seems incendiary, it is entirely by mistake.<br>

<br>
If you have more status than another Kindred your word is generally believed above theirs, end of story.  In addition, failing to respect another Kindred's status usually has severe social, if not physical, reprocussions such as losing Acknowledgement, banishment or even death if the disrespect is amazingly henious.  Those with a great deal of status should be treated (at least in social situations) as if they actually were those qualities.  It doesn't mean you have to actually 'think' those things, but if you plan on building a name for yourself or even exisiting in the City long term respecting status is recommended highly.<br>

I assume your referring to what went on Friday night? Good call. I felt your approach was more productive than that of the individual in question in any case. Now would be a wonderful time to give everyone an example of status by using it to crush someone who dared defy you. <br>

<br>
While the Proposed status system changes are a functional possibility, I must say I agree with Brandon, point for point. <br>
<br>
From what I understand, and I could be totally wrong on how this is supposed to work, the ideal Camarilla City is NEVER run by Neonates or usually even those as young as Ancillae. It would be the Elders who would hold the reigns and the system would be quite fudal/monarchic.<br>
<br>
That being said, the neonates would rarely be given much more than Acknowleged (and that would only come if the prince found that the new kindred was an asset and properly introduced/represented) unless they pulled off something monumental in the way of service to the city or one of the officers/primogen.<br>
<br>
It seems that there may be too much expectation for status to be rewarded for too little effort.<br>
<br>
For example: The Medieval recreation group, I and some of the other players/staff participate with, gives rewards for service. But, usually, those rewards do not happen without a letter of recommendation. Letters of recommendation don't happen unless there has been a prominent display of service. The other times they happen, it is usually on the whim of a King/Queen or a Prince/Princess.  My point is, those in power will not dole these awards out to people for just showing up. And in the Elders' eyes, those Neonates WERE born yesterday, DID just show up and definitely have not paid their dues.<br>
<br>
In my humble opinion, I believe that there the system outlined in the W.W. books is entirely and apropriately functional as long as Status is NOT easily earned.<br>
<br>
I do have one related question:<br>
In the books, is there some discussion about the difference between City Status and Camarilla Status?  I don't have many of the books so I haven't been able to read up on it.<br>

Time and time again the Santa Carla LARP has proven that it separates itself from traditional Camarilla games and even very traditional ideas of a WoD game. These changes were implmented to be specific to the needs of this LARP based on the kind of playstyles we see in the game. Its a basis, its a start to get people into understanding what a status system is, and understasnding how one basically works. Some people in this game don't really know or understand that now.<br>
<br>
Fact is, we don't have true Elders. We don't have a true structure like many cities who would adopt a more traditional status system. On top of all that, I have seen first hand that Vampire, in its truest form, can absolutely suck to play. To be a neonate in your &quot;TRUE&quot; vampire game with Elders and all the oppression is downright unfun at many times and can be abusive mentally to the average person.<br>
<br>
At some point we need to &quot;bring the status system down&quot; to a certain level that everyone, even the average Joe who's totally new to the game, can understand. That was my motivation and point behind doing this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hart@scbnforum58570>Hart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/26/03 3:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> status</span><hr size=1> beyond all the arguments above, some of them very appropriate, some of them not applicable to this game, one point seems to often be missed.<br>
this is a game run by a storyteller.<br>
storyteller means gamemaster.<br>
for better or worse the person in charge, no matter what their title, has to make decisions for how things will function practically in game.  all good game systems, including WoD, back this up, the books all say these things in more than one place &quot;change things so they work for you&quot; and &quot;the storyteller is the boss&quot;.<br>
which means simply, that while everyone's input is valuable (why I asked John to post his and Kristen's ideas here) ultimately the combination of the current and incoming staff will decide how status works for this game.<br>
Santa Cruz's game and the mythical Santa Carla has indeed, always been non-standard, that is part of it's charm... if you want other than what Santa Cruz/Carla is, then you have to go elsewhere.<br>

<br>
If so, then here's my two cents: I wouldn't mind at all if either the current or future staffs allowed Kirstin and John's proposals to be adopted. I recognize that it would be both a staff decision and a IC decision among those responsible for status. (Prince, Seneschal, Harpies, etc.) <br>
<br>
I feel this way for basically the reasons John expressed in his initial post. If a certain trait seems completely inappropriate for a character, I can't see myself role-playing it. I don't care if the status page says Character X should be &quot;Revered&quot;. If my character doesn't respect him that way, and if in fact few if any characters feel that way, then it simply doesn't work.   <br>
<br>
One possible alternative, and I've heard of this done in other games, is to express status with a number as opposed to adjectives. So, someone who was only acknowledged would have a Status of 1. I'm not saying we should do that, only that I've heard of it done that way. <br>
<br>
Sure, It'd be nice if status was a more playable concept in this game. But to me personally as a player, it would hardly be the key aspect in deciding whether or not I was going to stay or leave. <br>
<br>
But like I said, that's just my opinion.   <br>
<br>
I'd say something about how I feel about negative status traits being implemented, but as of this moment, that opinion would probably be biased based on IC stuff.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
