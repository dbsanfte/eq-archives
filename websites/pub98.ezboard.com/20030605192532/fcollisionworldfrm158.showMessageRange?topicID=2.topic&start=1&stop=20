<br>
The Temple Of Isis.  A holy sanctum of the Rubi Elves.  Surrounded by a patch of desert, the building was of white and rose-colored marble.  Statues of elves stood about the garden surrounding it, holding their hands up to the sky to praise the Gods.  Life was abundant, and clerics walked in and out of the entrance, tending the garden and telling tales of great feats to younger ones.<br>
<br>
Eris looked at it, and nodded.  She glanced at the man in Seifer's arms and frowned slightly.  Balder didn't look so good.  She gestured for them to move on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are we allowed here?&quot; Seifer asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure we are,&quot; Eris said softly.  &quot;They won't turn anyone away.  It's their religion.&quot;  Eris wasn't exactly religious, especially not of the elves' gods, but if she didn't do something Balder was gonna die.  &quot;I know someone here.  She'll help us.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/11/03 7:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm158.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> eeee! ^_^ ELVES!!!! *glomps all the elves*</span><hr size=1> Kirin looked at Eris.<br>
Did she really know someone that could teach her about her powers? A tired expression covered her face... <br>
Something else was on her mind also.<br>
<br>
&quot;You ok?&quot; Eevee asked her... <br>
Eevee had been watching her closely these past two days.<br>
<br>
Kirin looked at Eevee and nodded her head yes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nina, could you let me have the map back for a second?&quot; Kirin asked Nina, who had been looking over it out of curiousity. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

She blushed.  Compared to their starched white linen robes and dresses, and clear, flawless elven faces, she felt wretched in her bloodsoaked, tattered clothes and grimy cheeks, her matted hair that clung to her face with days of not washing(since the incident at the river).  <br>
<br>
As Nina asked Kirin for the nap, they heard someone singing from within the chamber.  It was not the sirensong of a river nymph.  It was beautiful and pure, and though none of them could tell precisely why, tears ran down their cheeks as they heard it.  Such was the effect of elfsong.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A merry summer of shimmering fate,<br>

Winter has fallen in blankets of snow,<br>

<br>
Nothing in the darkness that isn't in the light,<br>
And thus when sun falls shadows grow.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
A woman walked leisurely down the steps of the Temple.  Her hair was white and cut short to her shoulders, a band of silver silk circling her head like a halo of shimmering light.  The band held a misty veil that cut down to her forearms.  Her eyes to Eris were a misty blue.  To anyone else, who knows?<br>
<br>
She was lost in song, her white linen dress whispering about her as she moved.  She held a rod in her hand, topped with ringlets of gold and a misty green orb.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ayaka!&quot;<br>
<br>
When the elf priestess snapped out of her trance and saw her, she smiled beautifully, the sight alone bringing tears to Seifer's eyes...but when she saw their mudstreaked faces, cuts and scrapes, and the shivering, pallid, feverstricken Balder in Seifer's arms, she cried out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh sweet Isis!  What plague has fallen upon you all?&quot; she asked, her voice filled with agony as her sensitive elfsense felt the sick man's pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hiya, Ay--uh, Summoner Ayaka.&quot;  Seeing the incredulous looks about her, she bowed shortly to the elf.  &quot;Balder's sick, and some of our number may be wounded.  I...I told them we would find help here.&quot; Her eyes glanced at Nina, whose hand she held.<br>
<br>
Ayaka smiled.  &quot;And you did not speak false,&quot; she said.  Her expression became worried.  &quot;Come, come with me.  I will tend to Balder immediately.&quot; she did not tell how she knew his name.  &quot;The rest of you, my apprentices shall heal your wounds and find you beds to sleep in right away.  You look as if you have not slept in days.&quot;<br>
<br>
Several white clad elven women came out of nowhere and took the sick man into their arms, carrying him gently away into the temple.  Ayaka saw the distraught on Nina's face and knelt down to her, resting her slender elven hands on her shoulders.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your friend will be alright, Nina,&quot; she smiled assuringly.  Then she turned away, bowing to them politely first, before leaving them to tend to Balder, and more apprentices appeared in her stead, ready to take them to their rooms.<br>
<br>
One gasped.  &quot;A faerie!&quot; she said, looking wondrously at Eevee.  &quot;'Tis been so long since I saw one last.  Their beauty has not changed, even throughout the many years.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 223<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/11/03 9:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm158.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heehee... this is cool!

<br>
&quot;And i've not seen a full blooded elf in many years!&quot; She practically bowed to the summoner elf.<br>
<br>
Kirin's violet eyes looked around, very alert and curious.<br>
The elves were beautiful and fair...<br>
none of them were anything less than enchanting.<br>
<br>
Her mind wandered away as she beheld the wonderous and elegant beauty of the elven shrine.<br>
Everyhing was clean and carved with care.<br>
Out of the corner of her eye she caught an elf man with aqua eyes.<br>
Immediately she remembered ENari and his &quot;strikingly beautiful and enchanting&quot; aqua eyes.<br>

(i didn't know what to say)</span><hr size=1> The elven maids led them to their rooms, one for the women and one for the men(at this time, only Seifer, but Balder would go there once he was healed).  Both rooms were simple yet elegant, with comfortable beds and handmade silk covers and pillows of down.  They were brought food and water to drink, and fresh clothes to wear until theirs were washed and mended.  One said a short, casual prayer to the wooden basin in the corner, and the tub filled with warm, crystal clear water so they could wash.<br>
<br>
When Eris had been here her first time, Ayaka had with much difficulty broken her of the habit of doing these things herself.  In the Temple of Isis, hospitality was a holy rule, and they believed that in helping others, they were pleasing Isis and the other gods.  Plus, by elven ettiquette it was rude to refuse a host's hospitality.  So, forcing a smile, she let them take her tattered clothes, and give her a silken nightgown to wear, like all the other girls and women.  Then, telling them that anything else they needed was but a call away, they left.<br>
<br>
Eris sighed.  &quot;Sorry about that, guys.  It's their religion...it's right to treat us like this.&quot;  she blushed, feeling dirty and grimy. then she grinned.  &quot;I get dibs on the bathtub!

&quot;Nice to see you too again my lovely faerie.&quot; A warm deep voice came from behind her.<br>

There he was, his short silvery blue hair shining in the light, his gray eyes gleaming with happiness.<br>
<br>
&quot;There you are you silly little elf.&quot; She shook her head.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;You two are hardly ever apart, i sense something must be wrong.&quot; He sighed deeply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Marth... well you know Marth... he's kinda was imprisoned. But I helped him escape! He MADE me go away and told me to meet him at the Ryuin Ruins.&quot; Her tiny voice was clearly heard my the elf.<br>

Ack...no curtains.  The elves didn't put up any signs of privacy, or did they lock any doors, the gestures signaling distrust.  She gritted her teeth and looked back at the others, who weren't looking anyway.  Oh well...they were all girls here...<br>
<br>
Just as she undressed and stepped into the tub, the door adjoining the girl's and boy's rooms opened, and Seifer stood in the doorway, holding Eris' backpack.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris? You dropped this back there...OH GOOD GODS!!!&quot; he began to say to her.  Then he looked at her and screamed in a strangely high pitched voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aagh!&quot; Eris fell backward from the shock, quickly covering her body with the robe she had taken off.  Her face was white with embarrassment.  &quot;Seif!!!&quot; she shouted at him, staring lividly into his staring eyes.<br>
<br>
Quickly, but too late, he covered them, trying to shout above all the noise in the room.  &quot;I'm sorry, Eris! I'm really, REALLY sorry! I didn't know you were--um--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Get out, Seif!&quot; she yelled, turning red as she clung the robe tighter around her and waved him off with her free hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um...uh...yes! Leave! Yes!&quot; Stuttering nervously in embarrassment, flushing bright red, he tossed the backpack onto the floor and ran back into his room, slamming the door.<br>
<br>
Eris sighed as she stood up, her bottom sore from the fall.  &quot;For the love of Firadra,&quot; she cursed.  &quot;Pervert...I swear...&quot; She got into the tub and sank in so deep no one could see her past her nostrils. <br>

More bubbles surfaced as she sighed in embarrassment.  Stupid Seifer...<br>
<br>
She got out, pausing a moment to see if Seifer would charge down the door again, and dressed in her nightgown again.  She frowned to see the clear water had turned a mucky, greenblooded mess.  So she was very surprised when suddenly the water trembled a bit, and suddenly became warm and clear again, waiting for the next bather.<br>

&quot;Oh Isis, Goddess of Truth, Of Life, grant thy daughter's prayer.  Grant me with but a fragment of thy glorious power, a speck of sand on your infinite beach of wisdom and might, so I may help this sickened man.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ayaka knelt before an altar of Isis, carved beautifully in marble.  Balder laid before her, on a pallet covered by a sheet, shivering and trembling with cold even as his skin burned so hot.  His eyes were half lidded, and dim.<br>
<br>
A light surrounded Ayaka and Balder, concentrating from the elfmaid's hands.  Her eyes glowing, she bent over his body and placed one hand over his feverish forehead and lackluster eyes, and another on his chest.  The power of her goddess surged through her, filling her with holy ecstacy.  And when the light faded, Balder lay still, his skin cool to the touch and his color returning.  No longer did he tremble, no longer did he gasp for air.  He slept the sleep of righteousness, of the innocent.<br>
<br>
Ayaka gave a weary smile.  <br>
<br>
She grasped the medallion on her neck, the one of moonstone.  &quot;Thank you, Isis,&quot; she breathed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 231<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/11/03 11:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm158.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> eeeee!</span><hr size=1> &quot;Kirin quickly finished dressing and Eevee hollered at the elf man through the door again.<br>

Though she could be very quiet when she wanted to, in her present state she was shaking, rattling the knob as she turned it closed, tripping over the rug, and cursing under her breath.,<br>
<br>
Seifer was standing at the window, looking out on the oasis in the middle of the desert.  He turned and smiled wehn he saw her, but when he saw her so distraught, his brow furrowed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris...you okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh? Oh! Yeah, fine,&quot; she assured, brushing back her damp hair nervously.  There was a strange, high pitched sound to her voice.  &quot;I just...wanted to make sure you were still here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Still here? Where else am I gonna go?&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;Besides, I'm still waiting for my punishment.&quot;<br>

&quot;Punishment?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For walking in on you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh!&quot; she smiled nervously.  &quot;Oh, well, I'm letting you off the hook this time.  Just this once.  Don't get used to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't,&quot; Seifer chuckled.  He sighed and looked at the garden outside.  &quot;This place is beautiful.  Everything about it is so beautiful.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah...&quot; she joined him at the railing.  &quot;I've come here a few times, the first time when I was four.  It was summer then, not spring, and everything was lush and overgrown.  There were herons swimming in the ponds.  It was all so pretty.  And it hasn't changed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seifer looked at her.  &quot;What were you doing here when you were four?&quot;<br>
<br>
Eris choked quietly, caught by her own words.  She paused a minute.  &quot;Well...um...well...ah...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris.&quot; <br>
<br>
Seifer placed his hand over hers on the windowsill.  Eris felt the warmth gladly, and then scolded herself for the feelings she shouldn't have been enjoying at the touch.  She looked up at him and shrugged, smiling, but her eyes filled wih pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;I really had no where else to go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris!&quot; <br>
<br>
Ayaka came in the door, she and a couple of her apprentices carrying in Balder on a pallet.  She helped set him down on the bed, and smiled at them.<br>
<br>
&quot;He will be fine.  A night's rest, and he will be in perfect health.  Without aid, he would have died in but a few hours.  Blessed be to Isis.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Blessed be,&quot; Eris repeated softly, nodding, withdrawing her hand.  &quot;Nina'll be happy about this.&quot;<br>
