He knew several of the store staff, and many of the young ladies already shopping there were giving him funny looks as he walked the aisles picking out clothes. And why shouldn't they?  It's not ever day you see a 35-40 year old man ("Hah! 50 years ago." he thought to himself.) making selections in the young women's section of a trendy clothing store.<br>
<p>He picked out two pair of jeans, a pair of shorts (long enough to actually cover her butt cheeks), 3 blouses, 4 t-shirts and a set of sweats. Almost as an afterthought, and feeling more selfconcsious than ever, he grabbed a package of undies and a couple of bras, he hopped he had the right size, and headed to the checkout. The girl behind the counter started ringing it up. "For my daughter." he said nervously. He wasn't sure but he thought he saw a smirk. "She's going off to summer camp and needs a new wardrobe." he added unnecessarily. She looked at him out of the corner of her eye, but continued ringing up his purchases without comment. "Yeah, sure, she bought that. How many teenage daughters let their dads shop for them? You sound like an idiot." he berated himself silently.  "Aren't the Ventrue supposed to be able to make people forget things? Or is that the Tremere? Handy skill. I could use that now."<br>
<p>"$220.35" the clerk announced, scanning the last item.<br>
<p>"Ouch!" he thought. "Bit more than I expected. I didn't get that much cash. Ok, the checkbook it is." He wrote out the check, showed some ID and walked out of the store with his purchases. He headed down the block toward the parking garage, but just as he was about to turn the corner he stopped, looked across the street for a moment, then crossed and entered Book Shop Santa Carla, heading for the Periodicals section.<br>
<p>"I wonder what a young woman reads these days?" he mused, looking over the dizzying array of magazines. He perused all the store had to offer and walked out with a copy of something called "YM", "People" and "Cosmopolitan" as well as the more familar "Life Magazine" and a French photography magazine. Before leaving he'd checked the history section and found copies of his book there with a note from one of the staff tapped underneath:<br>
<blockquote><br>
"Benjamin James' artwork is amazing, but not for the faint of heart.  Nothing else reveals the brutality of war like a soldier's visual memoirs. Many of the works in this book were drawn as the events depicted actually happened.  Many, years later. In the forward, the editor states Dr. James was hesitant to let his work be published and viewing "Nordhausen, The Gas Chamber" it's easy to see why. He doesn't pull any punches. Much has been written about the horror of the NAZI concentration camps. It pales in comparison to Dr. James' drawings. With pencil and charcoal, Dr. James strips away the pretense that war is glamorous or adventurous. A medic with the 16th Regimental Combat Team, 1st Infantry Div., Benjamin James witnessed first hand the heavy casualties of the D-Day landings at Omaha Beach, the famed "Redball Express" and at Ohrdruf, the horror of NAZI death camps. He  completed his medical degree at Stanford after WWII and returned to the Army to serve in Korea. Lt. Colonel Benjamin James, MD, US Army (ret.) survived being wounded twice in combat to receive the Silver Star (twice), a Bronze Star and a Medal of Valor.<br>
</blockquote><br>
<p>"They make it sound like those medals mean anything. Why I let Michelle talk me into letting that thing be published, I'll never know." He crossed the street and headed for his Audi. "Yes you do. You love her." He put the shopping bags in the trunk and headed for the hospital.<br>
<p>"And what's your excuse for spending all that money for clothes for a junkie hooker? You're getting too involved, Doctor. You're getting too<br>
involved."<br>
<hr width="70%"><br>
<strong>(The next morning)</strong><br>
<p>Tina woke slowly. She drifted into consciousness once or twice, sensing but not quite seeing the person sitting next to her bed. Finally she drifted off to the sleep of the extremely tired, rather than the drug induced sleep of anasthesia.<br>
<p>She awoke the next morning with a pain in her gut, but not like the pain that brought her into the hospital in the first place. She looked around, saw the tube going into the back of her hand, followed it up to the IV bag over her head. Slowly she got her bearings and she remembered why she was here. Dr. James had been right, she had appendicitis and they'd had to operate.<br>
<p>And she was <strong>hungry</strong>. The nurse came in, saw she was awake and shoved a thermometer in her mouth while she took her pulse and BP. The nurse retrieved the thermometer and examining it told Tina "Dr. Edwards said you could have some breakfast if you're feeling up to it and your fever is down. Want something to eat?"<br>
<p>With a raspy throat, Tina gave an enthusiastic "Yes, please!"<br>
<p>"All right hun. Let me go order up a tray for you, then I'll bring you some ice chips." Returning a minute later, the nurse gave her a styrofoam cup of ice and a syringe. "Here you go. These should help that dry throat. And <em>this</em>" she said, sticking the needle into Tina's IV tube "should ease that <em>other</em> problem a bit...?" Moments later the hollow feeling in her teeth that Tina was just starting to feel faded out. She relaxed visibly, releasing tension she didn't even know was there. "Methadone." the nurse explained, patting her hand. "We can't fuel your habit here, but we aren't going to make you suffer.<br>
<p>Feeling slightly embarrassed, Tina asked "Was Dr. Edwards here last night?"<br>
<p>"No. Dr. James. And that's unusual. Most ER docs don't bother visiting their patients once they hand them off to surgery." she said with a puzzled voice as she walked back to her nurses station.<br>
<p>"He left you some stuff, dearie." Tina looked to her right at the older woman in the next bed, who pointed at the nightstand next to her. On the nightstand was a stack of magazines, two GAP bags sitting in front of it. "He was here all night. Sitting there by your bed, drawing in that sketch book."<br>
<p>She picked up the Cosmo magazine sitting on top of the pile and an envelope fell out. She opened the envelope and took out the card inside. It was one of those cheesy American Greetings type cards, with Winnie the Pooh on the front and Piglet and Tiger inside, and some stupid poem. But handwritten underneath, it said<br>
<blockquote><br>
"Just something to read while you recover. I don't know what teen girls like to read these days, so I got you an assortment.<br>
I hope the clothes fit. I figured you could use some pants that didn't show off your 'assets'.<br>
Get well soon.<br>
Benjamin<br>
</blockquote><br>
<p>With a sniffle, she clutched the card to her chest. It had been years since anyone had bought her anything. Even her "work" clothes came out of the meager allowance Coffee gave her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hart@scbnforum58570>Hart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#FF9300>(5/21/03 12:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A matter of conscience</span><hr size=1> OOC:<br>

Glad you liked it.<br>
Writing about his past has really helped me flesh out my own idea of who Benjamin James is. You'll probably see me playing him a bit stronger, now that I know where he comes from. I'm trying to shape Tina into an in-game NPC. Possibly a Contact or Retainer. I'll have to talk to Raven about that and see where it goes.<br>
I've always felt the itch to do some writing, but never had an creative ideas to write about. This is new for me. Now that I have a subject, things are starting to flow.<br>
Pretty soon I'll be covering things a little more relevant to his un-life. How he met Michelle and the events leading up to his embrace.<br>
<br>
BTW, who are you in-game? I can't quite figure it out from your literaries (probably because I only know the characters that have shown up the last few weeks). Armand's ghoul? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hart@scbnforum58570>Hart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#FF9300>(5/22/03 11:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thanks</span><hr size=1> *Used* to be Arman's ghoul, she's been embraced since then.
