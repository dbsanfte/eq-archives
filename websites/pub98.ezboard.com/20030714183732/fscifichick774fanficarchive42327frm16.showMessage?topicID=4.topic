Story # 3:  The Love Bug<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“It’s official,” Chloe said to Lana as she came up to the counter in the coffee shop.  “I’m dying.”  Lana shot her a sympathetic smile.<br>
<br>
“Still not feeling good, huh?”  She asked.  Chloe shook her head lightly, but stopped when it made her want to throw up.  “What did the doctor have to say?”  Chloe gave a partial roll of her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Lots of rest, lots of liquids so I don’t get dehydrated from puking my guts out, and that’s about it,” Chloe answered.  <br>
<br>
“Sorry.  You should go home.”<br>
<br>
“I will, just as soon as I get some coffee,” she said.  Lana looked at her friend warily and folded her arms across her chest.<br>
<br>
“When your doctor said ‘liquids’, I’m pretty sure he wasn’t referring to coffee,” Lana said.  Chloe glared at her and Lana threw her hands up in the air in mock surrender.  “Fine, fine!  But if you throw up on my counter, you’re cleaning it up.”  Chloe made a face and Lana leaned her head to the side.  “How about a nice hot cup of tea instead?”  Chloe grumbled.<br>
<br>
“Sadist,” she said.  Lana laughed and went to retrieve a ‘to-go’ cup of tea for her friend.  Chloe played with a small slip of paper in her hands.  <br>
<br>
“What’s that?”  Lana asked as she handed her the tea.<br>
<br>
“Prescription for anti-nausea meds,” Chloe answered with a shrug.  “Although I have a feeling that all it’s going to do is knock me out.”<br>
<br>
“That’s good,” Lana said.  “You need something to slow you down and make you rest; otherwise you’ll never get well.”  <br>
<br>
‘Thank you Mrs. Kent,’ Chloe thought with heavy sarcasm.  She forced a fake grin onto her lips and held back the comment, knowing that Lana wouldn’t take it as a comparison to Martha, but rather a reference to the ongoing triangle between her, Lana, and Clark that they all tried so hard not to talk about.<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk looked on invisibly as he saw Lex steal glances at Chloe when he thought no one else was watching.  He couldn’t help but feel a little bad for the guy, since it was kind of his fault that he had set the two of them up in the first place and now she seemed to be ignoring Lex any time they were in the same room together.  Although, granted, that hadn’t been often.  <br>
<br>
He saw Chloe hold the back of her hand up to her forehead and an idea formed in his head.  He zapped himself back to where the bathrooms were and reappeared, disguising himself as an average looking man in his mid-twenties.  He walked over to Lex’s table and pulled a chair out for himself without waiting for an invitation.  Lex arched an eyebrow at him and Mr. Mxyzptlk motioned toward Chloe with his head.<br>
<br>
“I can help you with her,” he said.  Lex looked at Chloe and then back to the seemingly young man sitting in front of him.<br>
<br>
“I beg your pardon?”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk leaned a little bit forward and Lex saw what he could have sworn was an actual twinkle in his eye.<br>
<br>
“She looks too sick to drive herself home safely; maybe you should offer her a ride?”  He hinted.  Lex frowned.<br>
<br>
“I doubt she’d take it.  She’s been avoiding me ever since ---” he caught himself just as he realized that he was starting to open up to a complete stranger.  Mr. Mxyzptlk didn’t look at him expectantly though; instead, he grinned and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Ever since your brother interrupted you trying to tell her that her dream wasn’t a dream,” he filled in.  Lex tilted his head and looked at him suspiciously.<br>
<br>
“How ---?”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk held up his hand to stop him from talking. <br>
<br>
“Like I said, I can help,” he said.  He let his eyes flicker over to the counter, but he knew that Chloe had already left while they were talking.  “Tough luck.  Looks like you missed that opportunity.”  Lex’s head whipped around and he frowned when he saw that Chloe was gone.  <br>
<br>
“Listen, I don’t ---” he started to say, but when he turned his head back around to look at the young man, Mr. Mxyzptlk had disappeared.  Lex looked around the Talon briefly, but the man was nowhere to be found.  He shook his head lightly and got up from his chair.  ‘Great.  My subconscious has created an imaginary friend for me,’ he thought.  Lana noticed that he was leaving and called over to him.<br>
<br>
“Lex?”<br>
<br>
Lex turned around and walked to the counter, where Lana flashed him a bright smile.<br>
<br>
“Did you need the books before you go?  We’ve been doing really well this month, I think you’ll be surprised,” she rambled.  Lex grimaced, but hid it well.<br>
<br>
“No, thanks,” he said.  She looked confused, so he decided that he’d better elaborate.  “I think I’m coming down with something.  I’m just going to go home and go to bed.”  It was a lie, but at least it was a feasible one.  After all, he couldn’t exactly tell her that he had started hallucinating or that he thought he might be starting to fall for her friend.  Lana gave him a pitying look that made Lex feel *really* sick.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry,” she said.  “It must be going around, because Chloe’s sick too.”  Lex blinked a couple of times before answering.<br>
<br>
“I saw her in here a few minutes ago,” he admitted.  “You were serving her coffee when she’s sick?”  ‘Good Luthor.  Put the blame on Lana.  That way she won’t pay attention to the fact that you said you saw Chloe,’ he thought.  Lana got a guilty look on her face.<br>
<br>
“Actually, I sort of convinced her to have tea instead,” she said.  Lex grinned in amusement.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t realize your debate skills had advanced that far.”<br>
<br>
“We-ll,” she strung out.  “I didn’t really give her a choice.”  Lex chuckled and Lana scrunched up her face into a stubborn expression.  “She shouldn’t be having caffeine right before she picks up her prescription anyway.”<br>
<br>
“Prescription?”<br>
<br>
“She said it’s for her nausea, and that it will probably just put her to sleep,” Lana explained.  Lex nodded.<br>
<br>
“It probably will,” he agreed, having gone through enough prescription medication in his earlier days to know what effects different drugs would have on someone’s body.  <br>
<br>
‘I can help you with her.’ <br>
<br>
Lex heard the man’s voice as clear as a bell in his head and concentrated on not letting it affect his outward appearance.<br>
<br>
‘You look tired.  Go home and get some sleep.’<br>
<br>
Lex couldn’t help the frown that played at his lips.  The young man hadn’t said that before, so he was ready to acknowledge now that he might actually be losing his mind.<br>
<br>
‘Your wife will be waiting for you.’ <br>
<br>
Lana’s voice pulled him out of his thoughts.  <br>
<br>
“Wow, you really don’t look so good.  You should go home and get some sleep, Lex.”<br>
<br>
He nodded and held up his hand in a partial wave and then left the building.  <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“Alright sweetheart,” the pharmacist said to Chloe as he handed her the bottle of pills.  “Now these will make you really drowsy, so wait until you’re at home to take them, and don’t drive when ---”<br>
<br>
“Okay, thanks Mr. Johnson,” Chloe said, cutting the older man off.  He could be really nice, but he could also be really tiring, and Chloe’s patience was already worn down to virtually nothing with the combination of being sick and Lana giving her tea instead of coffee.  She had already paid and after Chloe snatched the bottle from his hands, she practically ran from the pharmacy.  <br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk laughed as he morphed out of Mr. Johnson’s appearance and into his own.  <br>
<br>
“She’ll never know what hit her.”<br>

Story #3: The Love Bug – Chapter 2<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk watched invisibly as Chloe poured one of the pills out into her hand and popped it in her mouth, quickly followed by a swig of water to wash it down.  She sighed, replaced the cap on the bottle, and then headed toward her bedroom.  All of a sudden, her feet felt very heavy under her and she could barely make it down the hallway.  Her eyes started to drift closed before she even made it to her bed.  Mr. Mxyzptlk watched her lay her head down on her pillow and fall asleep, the mischievous grin on his lips growing with each second that passed.  <br>
<br>
“Time to get this show on the road,” he said.  With a snap of his fingers, Chloe disappeared from her bed, and reappeared sleeping on Lex’s bed.  <br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk looked around the room and decided that it needed some help if his scheme was going to work.  An impish gleam lit up in his eyes and with a sweep of his hand the room had been completely changed.  <br>
<br>
The room was now decorated in warm, inviting colors and had pictures of Chloe and Lex hanging up and placed throughout it.  <br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk smiled again and the clothes that Chloe had been wearing when she first appeared there were changed into a short aqua blue, silk and lace teddy.  He morphed into the image of the man Lex had seen earlier that day at the Talon, and covered her up with the blankets.  Then, an almost evil idea hit him.  He held out a hand and a stuffed yellow dragon with orange polka dots popped into it.  He tucked it underneath her arm and turned around to leave the room to greet Lex, who he now heard coming up the stairs.<br>
<br>
Lex narrowed his eyes when he saw the man leaning against the wall by his bedroom.<br>
<br>
“Should I even ask?”  Lex asked as he walked toward him.  Mr. Mxyzptlk flashed him a large smile and shrugged as he pushed himself off the wall.<br>
<br>
“I told you I could help, so I’m helping,” he replied cryptically.  “But you’ll have to play along if you want her to believe it’s real.”<br>
<br>
Lex’s eyebrows moved together suspiciously.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk motioned toward the open bedroom door and Lex took a few steps forward to glance into it.  His eyes grew wide in shock and he looked back at the man standing in front of him.<br>
<br>
“What’s going on?  What did you do to her?”<br>
<br>
“Calm down,” Mr. Mxyzptlk said as he looked down at Lex’s ring finger.  Lex followed his gaze and was shocked to find a platinum ring now resting on his finger.  He looked back up at Mr. Mxyzptlk, who just grinned at him, and started to tell him his cover story for when Chloe woke up.  “You’ve been married for two years.  You have a baby girl named Lena.  Your photo albums and home movies are under the TV if she wants proof.”  Lex stared blankly at him and Mr. Mxyzptlk rolled his eyes.  “I thought you were supposed to be smart.  Come on, let’s go.  You only have a small window of time here.”  <br>
<br>
Lex looked into the room again and a smile curled the corners of his mouth upward.  <br>
<br>
‘Okay, so I’m dreaming or hallucinating,’ he thought.  ‘Maybe I should have a talk with Lana about what she’s been putting in the coffee.’<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk slapped him on the shoulder and Lex looked back at him.<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry; it’ll all come to you when you wake up.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lana smiled at Clark as they walked into the house.  <br>
<br>
“Just let me check on Chloe, grab my books, and then we can study,” she said.  Clark smiled and nodded.<br>
<br>
“No problem.  Is she feeling any better?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know.  She wasn’t when I saw her earlier this morning, but maybe the medicine that the doctor gave her has helped,” Lana said as she started to climb up the stairs.  She walked down the upper hallway a little bit until she got to Chloe’s room and then she knocked softly on the door.  It came open as she knocked on it and she looked in, only to find that Chloe wasn’t there.  Lana blinked her eyes a couple of times in surprise.  “Clark?”  She called out with some worry in her voice.  <br>
<br>
Clark looked up at her from the bottom of the stairs.<br>
<br>
“Yeah?”<br>
<br>
“She’s not here.”<br>
<br>
“What?  Where else would she be?”  Clark asked, now walking up the stairs to meet Lana.  Lana shook her head a little.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” she said and took a few steps into Chloe’s empty room.  “She said she was going home after she got her medicine and I saw her pills on the table as we came in.”<br>
<br>
“Me too,” Clark said.  Lana bit her lip when she saw Chloe’s bag on the ground and her cell phone was laying half out of it.  Clark’s mouth dropped open as he noticed the same thing.  <br>
<br>
“She never goes anywhere without her cell phone.”<br>
<br>
“I know,” Clark said in agreement.  A sudden jolt of panic swept through his body.  “Lana?”  She looked up at him.  “You know all those weird things that have been happening?”  She nodded.  “You don’t think ---?”<br>
<br>
“Oh my God,” Lana said and put her hand over her mouth.  “What do we do?”  Clark paused for a minute before answering.<br>
<br>
“I’ll go look for her,” Clark said.<br>
<br>
“Clark,” Lana said and tilted her head to the side with a concerned expression.  Clark placed his hand on her shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Call Pete, have him check his end of town,” he said.  Lana let go of the breath she was holding in.  This wasn’t a Clark chasing after Chloe because he harbored feelings for her thing; this was a Clark chasing after Chloe because he was concerned about his friend sort of thing.  Lana nodded and gave him a wince of a smile.<br>
<br>
“Okay.”  She caught his arm as he started to leave.  “Call me if you find anything out.”  <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
When Chloe started to wake up, she was no longer nauseous, dizzy, or running a fever.<br>
<br>
‘Wow.  That stuff really works,’ she thought.  She furrowed her brow as she untucked the stuffed dragon from her arm and eyed it with confusion.  Then she really noticed her surroundings, and more importantly, she noticed the warm body pressed up against her back that had an arm slung over her waist.  Her eyes widened, but rather than acting on her first instinct and jumping out of the bed, she slowly turned her head and body to see who’s arms she was wrapped in.  Chloe felt a tightening in the pit of her stomach when she saw him.  She started to sit up and lifted her hand to push back the blanket so she could crawl out of the bed.  That’s when she noticed the large diamond ring and wedding band on her finger.  “Okay, now I’m dreaming that I’m married to the guy,” she mumbled, “this can not be good.”<br>
<br>
“Mmm,” Lex said and pulled her closer again.  His eyes flitted open when he realized that she wasn’t lying down anymore.  “Sweetheart,” he said in a groggy voice, pulling himself up to a sitting position.  Chloe’s eyes darted away from him when the sheets moved back and she could see that he wasn’t wearing any clothes.  “How long have you been up?”<br>
<br>
She couldn’t help but think how real this all felt.  The soft sheets beneath her, the silk of her teddy against her skin --- the color rushed to Chloe’s face when she saw what she was wearing.  <br>
<br>
“I ---” Chloe saw the door to what appeared to be the bathroom and she looked over at Lex for a split second before throwing the small stuffed dragon in her hands at him.  “Be right back!”  She bounced quickly out of the bed and started almost running to the bathroom, which for some reason, she didn’t seem to be getting any closer to.  A brief thought popped into her head that it was like the Scooby-Doo episode where they were in the fun house and couldn’t get away.<br>
<br>
Lex jumped out of bed and within seconds he had run up behind her.  He placed his hands on her upper arms and turned her around, only to bring his mouth down to hers in what he intended to be a passionate kiss.  Chloe struggled to get away from him at first, but soon felt herself melting beneath his lips and returning the kiss.  His tongue slid along her bottom lip and Chloe opened her mouth for him.  Their tongues snaked against each other and Chloe could feel Lex’s arousal pressed up against her.  Everything felt entirely too real to be a dream, but she knew it wasn’t reality – so what was it?<br>
<br>
Lex lifted her up and Chloe wrapped her legs around his waist as he took her back over to the bed.   He kissed her again as he lay her down on the bed.  <br>
<br>
“We don’t have much time before Lena wakes up,” he murmured into her hair.  Chloe creased her brow and moved her head to the side.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
Lex nipped at her neck and Chloe struggled to keep her eyes open and remain attentive.<br>
<br>
“Agnes said she was up a lot last night,” he explained.<br>
<br>
“Agnes?”<br>
<br>
Lex pulled back and leaned his head to the side to look at her.<br>
<br>
“Are you feeling okay?”<br>
<br>
“Obviously not,” she answered.  “Oh, that stupid medicine.  Why didn’t I figure it out before?”  She asked herself.<br>
<br>
“Chloe, what are you talking about?”<br>
<br>
“Nothing, nothing,” she said.  “Don’t worry about it.”  Lex gave her a strange look and then began to lean down to kiss her again when a knock came at the door.  He groaned and pushed himself off the bed, walking quickly to the closet where he took two fluffy white robes off of the door.  He threw one at Chloe and put the other on himself.<br>
<br>
He walked to the door and opened it.  Chloe’s mouth dropped open when she saw who was on the other side.<br>

Story #3: The Love Bug – Chapter 3<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe looked at the older woman standing on the other side of the door with a pudgy baby girl in her arms.  Chloe stood there in her robe, staring at the baby in shock.  The little girl appeared to be about nine months old and there was no mistaking who her parents were supposed to be.  She had small red curls gracing the top of her head, one of them tied up in a bow and Chloe noticed that her eyes looked achingly similar to her own.  She wasn’t about to admit that it looked like the baby had inherited her fat cheeks from when she was a baby too, but it was obvious that she had.<br>
<br>
‘This isn’t happening, this isn’t happening,’ she repeated as a mantra in her head.  <br>
<br>
“Lena,” Lex greeted, holding his arms out until the nanny transferred the baby over to him.<br>
<br>
“I’m so sorry to interrupt your time together, but she was still a little fussy after feeding, so I thought she might want her parents,” the nanny said.  Lex nodded once at her and then looked back at the baby smiling at him.  <br>
<br>
“Thank you Agnes,” he said.  The woman smiled warmly at Chloe and then shut the door behind her as she left.  Lex held Lena up with his hands.  “How is my little monchichi?”  He brought her stomach to his nose and gently rubbed against it, causing the baby to spurt into giggles.  <br>
<br>
“Monchichi?”  Chloe asked.  Lex smiled over at her and then started walking closer with the baby.  <br>
<br>
“You want mommy?”  He asked Lena, ignoring Chloe’s question.  The baby leaned toward Chloe while still in Lex’s arms.<br>
<br>
“Mama,” she said with her arms outstretched and a bright smile that displayed one tooth in the bottom of her mouth.  <br>
<br>
“I – uh ---” Chloe trailed off as Lena practically jumped into her arms from Lex’s.  “Hi.”  The little girl started laughing and then leaned forward to give Chloe a drool-filled semi-kiss against her mouth.  <br>
<br>
“Mama,” Lena said again in a contended voice as she snuggled up to Chloe.  Lex folded his arms across his chest and looked at Chloe and Lena with a small smile.<br>
<br>
“She’s such a mommy’s girl,” he commented and then met Chloe’s eyes with his own.  “I don’t suppose you’ve given any more thought to having another one?”  Chloe’s eyes widened at his suggestion and he tilted his head to the side.  “I’m feeling a bit outnumbered, you know?”<br>
<br>
“I ---” Chloe trailed off as she looked down at the baby, who was now gazing at her mother like she was the most beautiful creature in the world.  Lena noticed the stuffed dragon on the bed and her face lit up.<br>
<br>
“Mxyzptlk!”  Lena said and stretched out her arms to try and reach it.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“I haven’t been able to figure out what she’s trying to call that thing either,” Lex admitted.  Chloe reached behind her and then handed the dragon to Lena, who promptly bit down on its snout.  Lex started laughing and his gaze turned to Chloe.  “I wonder where she gets that from,” he said teasingly.  Chloe looked at him questioningly and he came to stand next to her, his warm breath hitting her ear with his next words.  “Not that I mind.”  He nipped at her earlobe gently and Chloe turned her head to face him, just now noticing that he had a rather large hickey on the upper part of his neck.  <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Clark checked everywhere he could think of that Chloe might be.  He checked with her neighbors, at the school (and not just the Torch office), and at the Talon, but she seemed to have just disappeared into thin air.  He started to get really concerned when Lana told him that Pete hadn’t been able to find her yet either.  Clark’s bad feeling about the strange imp being involved was becoming more and more pronounced, and he only hoped that if Mr. Mxyzptlk was involved that he wouldn’t do anything to hurt Chloe.  Clark shook his head a little with guilt.  If anything happened to her, it would be his fault because he didn’t get to her in time to stop it.  <br>
<br>
‘But I’ve checked everywhere,’ he thought to himself.  ‘Well, not *everywhere*,’ he corrected and then shook his head again.  ‘Lex is going to think I’m nuts.’<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe flipped through one of the photo albums she found under the television set.  She still couldn’t believe this was happening, but she knew it wasn’t a dream.  It was too real to be a dream.  But, how could she have lost her memory and only remember part of her life?  How the hell did she end up married to Lex Luthor?<br>
<br>
‘And for a whopping two years none the less,’ Chloe thought to herself.  ‘It must be some sort of record for him.’<br>
<br>
Then there was the baby.  Lena.  How could she not remember having a baby?  And how had she been able to do it without getting any stretch marks?  Chloe frowned and stared down at the pictures in the album.  The last one was filled with pictures of them and their friends and family at the wedding and reception that she couldn’t remember – even though the pictures were there to prove that she had been there.  The current album was filled with pictures of a honeymoon that she only wished she had in her memories.  <br>
<br>
Her and Lex on some tropical beach.  They looked so happy together that it made Chloe’s heart hurt just to see the photos of memories that she didn’t have.  She felt the tears starting to well up in her eyes.<br>
<br>
“I think we may have to cancel our plans for the day,” Lex said casually as he walked back into the room.  “Lena’s gone to sleep again.”  He took off the robe and threw it on a chair sitting against the wall.  He noticed the photo albums spread out over the bed and he strolled over to her.  Chloe felt a weight settle behind her on the bed.<br>
<br>
“Bermuda,” Lex said wistfully into her ear, wrapping one arm around her waist and placing his other hand on her upper arm.  He kissed the shell of her ear gently and let his lips linger against her skin.  “I have a break in my schedule coming up, so we can go again if you’d like.”  She felt him smirk as he trailed his mouth down to her neck.  “Or would you prefer to go to the cabin?”  Chloe looked questioningly at him through the corner of her eye.  “We could tell the kids they were conceived in the same place,” he teased.  Chloe wasn’t sure why the blush spread to her cheeks, but it did.  Lex grinned at her reaction and then repositioned himself so he could kiss her.  <br>
<br>
Before she had a chance to object, his tongue was weaving its way into her mouth and sliding against her own.  Chloe let out a small gasp when she felt his fingers pinch one of her nipples and then continue to tease it by rolling it back and forth.  Her body wanted him – she knew that much.  She figured that she must have gotten used to him while they were married, but this felt so new – and so right.  Lex slowly moved her until she was lying down on the bed, and then something happened that made Chloe’s eyes shoot open.  He delved a finger into her waiting wetness.<br>
<br>
“God, Chloe,” he murmured against her as her heat surrounded him and he started pumping his finger in and out of her.  He added another and Chloe’s hips bucked, making Lex inwardly smile with masculine pride.  He loved the way her body responded to him.  Chloe’s stomach started to tighten and her orgasm started to wash over her in heaping waves of pleasure.  <br>
<br>
“Lex,” she moaned, gripping the sheets beside her with tightly clenched fists.  That was all the encouragement Lex needed to hear.  He positioned himself between her legs and plunged into her in one fluid motion.  Chloe screamed at the pain that it caused, but it quickly turned to pleasure and she found her hands digging into his back as he thrust himself in and out of her.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe,” he half-whispered before capturing her mouth with his own again.  He was so close and he could feel that Chloe was on the verge again too – just a few more pumps and --- a second after that thought, Lex found himself spilling his seed onto the bed.  Chloe had disappeared and the room had returned to normal.  He looked around in confusion.  “What the fuck?!”  <br>
<br>
It was all a dream – it had to have been.  And now he had been rudely awakened and wasn’t at all happy about it.  One minute he was married to Chloe, with a happy life and a beautiful daughter – and the next he was back where he started.  He growled and sprung off the bed, promptly throwing the alarm clock at the wall.  There was a knock on the door and Lex grabbed the robe that was now hanging back up in his closet.  Quickly putting it on, he answered the door.<br>
<br>
“What?!”  He snapped at the butler on the other side of the door.<br>
<br>
“Clark Kent is here to see you.  Is this a bad time?  Shall I send him away?”  The man asked.  Lex’s glare was bearing an imaginary hole through the servant’s head.  <br>
<br>
“No.  Just give me a minute.  I’ll meet him downstairs,” Lex said angrily.  The butler nodded and turned on his heel to leave.  Lex threw his clothes on, the entire time cursing the fact that his dreams were getting more and more indistinguishable from real life and that Chloe wasn’t really his.  No.  Chloe was in love with Clark.  Lex clenched his hands into fists and then released them.  Something was going to have to be done about that.  “Clark,” he greeted in what he hoped passed as a neutral tone as he came down the stairs.<br>
<br>
“Hey Lex,” Clark said.  “Sorry to bother you, but Chloe is missing.  We’ve been looking all over town for her, but we haven’t been able to find her anywhere and I’m starting to get worried.  I don’t suppose you’ve seen her?”  He asked somewhat sheepishly.  Lex stared blankly at him as he tried to comprehend what Clark was saying.  Clark’s cell phone rang before Lex got a chance to speak.  Clark pressed the phone up to his ear.  “Hello? --- She is? --- Where? --- Okay, thanks Lana.”  Clark hung up the phone and gave Lex an apologetic smile.  “Sorry about that.  Lana said that Chloe must have come back into the house while she was in another room, because she’s in her bedroom fast asleep now.  So --- thanks anyway.”  He gave a slight wave of his hand and Lex watched him exit through the front door.<br>
<br>
“It *wasn’t* a dream,” Lex mused aloud, somewhat awestruck by the thought.  He remembered his ‘imaginary friend’, or not so imaginary as it had turned out, and he pursed his lips.  He was going to have to track him down.  He wanted his other life back.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe stretched her arms out and let out a loud yawn as she woke up.  She blinked a few times as she took in the scene around her.  It was her bedroom – her old bedroom.  She absently ran her hand across her forehead and through her hair, and felt the heat radiating from her skin.<br>
<br>
“It really *was* just a dream?”  She mused aloud.  She let her head flop back against her pillow, instantly regretting it when the pain in her head started to throb.  “Well, that sucks.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
