Voters still rank candidates, much like in IRV, but instead they rank all of the candidates in the feild; then the real fun begins.<br>
The main idea is that each race is conceptually broken down into separate pairwise races between each possible pairing of the candidates.  Each ranked ballot is then interpreted as a vote in each of those one-on-one races. If candidate A is ranked above candidate B by a particular voter, that is interpreted as a vote for A over B. If one candidates beats each of the other candidates in their one-on-one races, that candidate wins. Otherwise, the result is ambiguous and a simple (relatively speaking) procedure is used to resolve the ambiguity.<br>
It's probably best to have the 'experts' explain it, since they have diagrams and the like.<br>

<br>
55 voters are voting in a primary between 5 candidates.<br>
<br>
18 of them prefer Tsongas to Kerrey to Clinton to Harkin to Brown<br>
12 of them prefer Clinton to Harkin to Kerrey to Brown to Tsongas<br>
10 of them prefer Brown to Clinton to Harkin to Kerrey to Tsongas<br>
9 of them prefer Kerrey to Brown to Harkin to Clinton to Tsongas<br>
4 of them prefer Harkin to Clinton to Kerrey to Brown to Tsongas<br>
2 of them prefer Harkin to Brown to Kerrey to Clinton to Tsongas<br>
<br>
Who should win?<br>
<br>
Under our current plurality, &quot;winner-take-all&quot; system, Tsongas would win because he had the most first place votes.<br>
<br>
If a single runoff election was held between the top two candidates, Clinton would win the runoff by a landslide.<br>
<br>
If instant runoff was used, dropping the candidates from the running one at a time depending on who had the fewest first place votes, then Brown would end up winning.<br>
<br>
If a Borda count was used, giving each candidate 5 points for a 1st place vote, 4 points for 2nd place, etc., then Kerrey would win.<br>
<br>
Finally, if Condorcet voting was used, Harkin would win, since he would win a one-on-one election against any of the other candidates.<br>
<br>
Who do you think should win, and why?<br>
<br>
This, by the way, fails to illustrate why I'm leaning towards  Condorcet voting: not because it's criteria necessarily produces the best candidate, since in an election like the above it isn't clear by any means who is the &quot;best&quot;. The appeal of Condorcet voting is that in all but the most degenerate cases (e.g. where most people prefer A to B, most people prefer B to C, and most people prefer C to A) Condorcet removes any incentive to make the election even worse by not &quot;throwing your vote away&quot;; in every other method mentioned, there are voters who can improve the outcome of the election (according to their own preferences) by voting something other than their own honest rankings.<br>

<br>
Just a question though.  Who is going to pay for the people to teach every voter to understand the ballots?  Or conversely who is going to hold the voter's hand and explain the ballot while they are filling it out?  This seems really complex.  Granted people of reasonable intelligence will be able to figure it out.  Unfortunately people without a reasonable amount of intelligence still have a right to vote.<br>

I know I sound fecicious (sorry not sure how that word is spelled), but I think its a valid point.  <br>

<br>
Pros: (1) appears this system could eliminate people voting for a D because they know the G will lose and are afraid voting for G will lead to an R winning the election.  While also not giving them an advantage over the people that rank the R in the top slot.<br>
(2) Because of the above we could begin to see third and fourth party candidates getting into office (yay down with 2 party system).  It would still be a long time before the D's and R's lose there stranglehold but is possibly a step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Cons: (1) mathematics.  I am not sure many people will be able to understand the math behind this.  For example it probably won't occur to people that ranking 2nd and 3rd choices could actually hurt their 1st choice in a close election.  <br>
(2) Buy in.  Selling this concept to voters probably isn't going to be easy.  It is riddled with things that the average voter won't understand readily.  (I think it could be explained sufficiently to most voters though).<br>
(3)  I really don't have a 3rd con but I am going to look for arguments for and against it.  I am sure someone out there has thought of something I haven't ;-)<br>

<br>
I agree that selling CV to the masses may be difficult but so what.  It's not really that complicated, it's just something that can't be broken down into cute little sound bites.  As a voter you don't have to understand the math behind Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping (though it's not to bad either.)  You just have to know the basics of how it works.  Kinda like using a computer, you don't have to know how to program the damn things, just how to make them do what you want.  The ballots themselves are easy to understand, just rank your candidates as far as you want to go, the computers do the tabulation.  I think if the momentum behind IRV was shifted to CV we'd be in good shape as far as changing the system goes.  Because really CV is no more complicated than IRV, until you hit those ambiguities, which shouldn't happen too often.  Any thoughts on the best way to take it to the masses?<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>drop the weakest (smallest magnitude) defeat, repeating if necessary until one of the candidates is unbeaten.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If your first choice is ranked lower (Nader), and your second choice is ranked higher in the runnings (Gore), then you've helped bump Nader out of the runnings by making the split between Gore and the other candidates higher. BUT you've also helped Nader more than Gore by giving him am extra vote against everyone else, including Gore.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
You've voted like this: Nader 1, Gore 2, Bush 3<br>
Total results - an ambiguous vote:<br>
G/B 32   XB/G 20X<br>
N/G 31   XG/N 20X<br>
B/N 30   XN/B 15X<br>
   -You've added one vote to N/G, but you've also added one vote to G/B, keeping the spread between the two elections the same, meaning Gore wins. If you'd have just ranked Nader, and left other slots blank, the race would be even (G/B 31). I'm not sure what they'd do in that situation, but as it stands in this election, Gore wins.<br>
<br>
Of course, this isn't a problem except in the closest races. But say the spread looked like this: <br>
<br>
G/B 32,000 <br>
N/G 31,000. <br>
<br>
If 1,001 people wanted to put down N as their only ranked choice, but didn't realize that NOT doing so would hurt N, then they would have hurt N unknowingly.<br>
<br>
Even with this system, though, they've still had a fair say in the situation, and were responsible for Gore winning the election - a much better choice for them than Bush.<br>

The only time your #1 pick is going to be dropped (in a bigger than 3 candidate race) is if it just plain can't win, there's no reason to rank your no chance in hell, fringe party candidate (like the IWW party or the Constitution party) lower than #1 if that's who you really want.  <br>
And the more candidates you vote for behind your #1 pick the bigger the victory over them or the smaller the defeat, depending on the rest of the voters.  So ranking more candidates is just as likely to strengthen your candidate's position as it is to weaken it.

<br>
It is still a valid con to the style of voting, but it's a very small one, as the system would still work as it should in this situation - people would still have a voice in the matter of who their president is, even if their first choice did not win.<br>
<br>
This may be taken as a loss by some, but it's also a partial victory.<br>
<br>
I'm not arguing to throw out this system because of that loophole - on the contrary I think it's a great system; much better than what we currently have.<br>
<br>
But I gaurantee that when we talk about this outside of this board, we'll hear a lot of arguments against it. I'd like to know what some of those potential concerns are and have time to think about them to decide if they're *really* an issue.<br>
