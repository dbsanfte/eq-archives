Cedric smiled as he saw his hometown, knowing that evil hadn't scarred everything just yet.<br>
<br>
It wasn't long before the group started recieving stares from the passersby.  Mirak was easy to ignore, in his human form, but Kyonae was a different story.  Covered in snake blood and slime.  Everyone had their cuts and bruises.  One man passed by them, looking at Kyonae in awe and disgust, and Ember stepped in his path, shaking her fist at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Back off buster,&quot; she growled.  &quot;Nothing to stare at except my fist in your frickin' face!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ember, come along,&quot; Menion said, leading her away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah yeah...&quot; Ember grumbled.<br>
<br>
Kyonae sighed inwardly, looking at the calm normality of Bracos life.  They were safe...but for how long?<br>

Murmuring a word of gratefulness she reluctantly took the coat and put it around herself, having a feeling she would offend him if she refused, and quickly averted her eyes away. After all, it wans't like Kyonae herself looked well nourished...sometimes people asked her if she was sick.<br>
<br>
Menion looked warily as the exchange was made between them.  An act of kindness from Mirak?  It looked suspicious.  But he ignored it.<br>
<br>
&quot;We should go to the inn,&quot; Naomi suggested, looking around.  &quot;And it would be best not to draw attention to ourselves...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 243<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/5/03 12:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm90.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bracos</span><hr size=1> Cedric smiled.  &quot;Hey, I have an idea.&quot;  He stopped and looked at them all.  &quot;We can go to my house.

It is the same with ice mages...we always look sickly, and we are easily wounded physically, but sometimes we are the most powerful of all elements.  Ice was the first founder of Mahtim, you see.  The First Born Goddess...she lived sleeping and alone before the Eternal Null, covering the planet with barren cold...and then the First Dawn came and banished her to the Poles, and created from her Sea.  Sea created Storm, and Flower, and they created Fire.  But none of them ever knew what lay dormant in Mahtim's womb...Evil, she was called.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is a long, complcated tale.  I'll save it for another time, when we have time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Here we are!&quot; Cedric exclaimed happily, looking up at a very nice, but old looking house.  &quot;Hasn't changed a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I get first dibs on the bath,&quot; Ember spoke up.  then she paused and looked at Kyonae.  &quot;Or maybe you should go first,&quot; she snickered good naturedly.<br>

He knew it was none of his business, but he didn't like the notion at all. Grimacing, he stepped over the threshold.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is it,&quot; Cedric said proudly.  &quot;There are plenty of rooms upstairs.  Grandma always liked visitors.  We can get changed and rest up there.  There are two bathrooms down the hall, so no need to race for them, Ember.  C'mon, ?Menion, I wanna show you my room!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Naomi caught hold of his arm.  &quot;Calm yourself, Menion,&quot; she warned quietly as to not arouse attention.  &quot;He is to be trusted, and if not that, at least accepted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Menion stared at her, and she could tell he was worried about Kyonae.  &quot;I accept him well enough,&quot; he murmured, before going upstairs with Cedric.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dibs on bathroom!&quot; Ember cried before running down the hall.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll just wait here,&quot; Naomi purred, sitting down and poring through an old book that was lying on the coffee table.<br>
<br>
Kyonae nodded.  &quot;If you do not mind to wait,&quot; she said, &quot;I will tell you.  But right now I feel I'd do best to clean myself up a little...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! Get out, get out, GET OUT!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
A shriek filled the empty house, and another cry echoed it.  Ember ran out, soaking wet, blushing, cursing, and laughing furiously.<br>
<br>
Behind her stormed a green haired woman, who was also soaked.  Purple eyes blazed with fury and embarrassment, and she had a green towel wrapped around her shivering body.  She looked like she had just come out of a bath...or had been in the act of taking one.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get out, you filthy firetot! Don't you have the decency to bloody KNOCK???&quot; Eve Elkwood yelled at the redhead.<br>

She came forward and hugged Kyonae tightly, almost too tightly, until a strangled cry escaped the ice mage's lips.  Eve pulled back on kissed the white-haired woman on each cheek. &quot;Oh, Kyonae!  It's so WONDERFUL to see you again!  I was so terribly, terribly worried about you!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Eve!&quot; Kyonae gasped, trying to pry the woman's arms off of her. &quot;What are you doing here???&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I got your letter,&quot;  Eve explained, &quot;Sa-Shenu brought it.  But by the time I got to the inn, you'd already left! and in a hurry, Mitzi told me,&quot; she added, looking at Kyonae.  She looked at her bloodied face and slimy clothes, underneath Mirak's garb.   &quot;I was so terribly worried something dreadful had happened to you! But I had an intuition that you would come here, and so I got here first and waited for you.  Where in the graces of Blossoma were you anyway?&quot;  she cried suddenly, her hands on her hips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh...never mind.&quot;  Kyonae looked at Mirak apologetically.  Eve was very fond of Kyonae, one of her only friends.  &quot;This is Eve Elkwood.  She's a...a friend of mine.  Eve, this is Mirak.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eve smiled at Mirak, warmly despite his appearance.  &quot;Hello, there,&quot; she said, shaking his clawed hand.  She chuckled.  &quot;My...what a grip you've got.  And so brittle looking! when have you eaten last, dear?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kyonae sighed quietly, looking at Mirak with a look that told him she treated everyone like this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/11/03 8:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm90.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cedric's Place</span><hr size=1> Mirak looked at Eve and answered, &quot;I am a Void Demon I need not eat, drink or rest&quot; Mirak told Eve. &quot;Now what shall we do now?

<br>
Eve snorted.  &quot;Cedric.  so rude.  Won't even say hello to me.&quot;  And she looked narrowed eyed at MEnion also.  &quot;Oh, and you're here too, are you?  You better not have been causing any pretense to Kyonae, Strife.  I still remember last time,&quot; she added hotly.<br>

My, has Kyonae been talking to you?&quot; Eve asked skeptically.  &quot;My dear, it's all rubbish.  Just a fairy tale, really.  I don't know HOW Mahtim was created, but it was certianly not by what she tells us.&quot;  Eve sighed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Eve,&quot; Naomi said, looking at her.  She looked at Mirak.  I am sorry.  Eve is very skeptical. <br>
<br>
&quot;Um, I can tell you.&quot; Cedric smiled, happy to be needed.  &quot;I know alot about anything in Dratilian or world history.&quot;  He grinned.  &quot;So, whaddya need to know, Mirak? There are lots of god's tales, and I know most of them.  But I'm not sure which one you're speaking of. Care to elaborate a bit?&quot;<br>
<br>
Naomi nodded.  &quot;Very well,&quot; she said.  &quot;I will return.&quot; And with that she went into the bathroom to talk with Kyonae. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/13/03 12:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm90.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cedric's Place</span><hr size=1> &quot;I myself am not to sure which of these tales it is but I believe its the one about the goddess we are currently trying to stop&quot; Mirak told Cedric. &quot;I myself have knowledge of many worlds but of this world my knowledge is quite poor.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 274<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/13/03 11:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm90.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cedric's Place</span><hr size=1> &quot;Oh, that one!&quot; Cedric smiled, but he couldn't hide the grave tone in his voice.  &quot;Of course.  I know that one by heart.&quot;  He watched as Menion went into the kitchen to find them something to eat.  Eve went to change into clothes.  And Ember had just disappeared...probably to just look around.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it's a really complicated story,&quot; he began, sitting down in a chair.  &quot;You see, no one was alive during the First Dawn, and the story was told by the Goddess Ice to the First Elf Sukebeno.   You see, Ice had already been somewhat alive...she was the one that had kept Mahtim intact, during the Null...but I'll get to that.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the very beginning, there was the eternal Null.  The sun was too young to give the entire galaxy light, and everything was in darkness.  Mahtim was just a barren sphere, covered in ice, an unfertilized seed, if you will.  But suddenly, something happened.  The sun exploded!  It had grown so full of feeding on the darkness that it just erupted, and expanded instantly into the size we know it as today.  <br>
<br>
&quot;The magical radiance from the exploding star did something to the planet.  It kind of fertilized it, I guess.  But Ice had said the earth had shuddered beneath her, and suddenly there was life, and overwhelming heat.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was called the First Dawn.  The first Gods were then born.  Ice melted and was banished to the north and south poles, where she took form in the north.  Her aftermath created Sea.  Sea created Storm. Storm created Flower and Fire, and Wind.  The first six were born.<br>
<br>
&quot;But when Mahtim came alive, her seed was born.  In her very core, their was another Goddess.  She was born weak, and blind, because she was born in darkness and in the very womb of the earth.  But she was born in rage and hatred, because she was trapped within her womb, and could not escape.  Her name was Evil, the only Goddess that never witnessed the First Dawn.<br>
<br>
&quot;For thousands of years, the Gods went on creating without knowing her presence.  Ice knew, for she had shared the sphere with Evil before the Dawn.  But she said nothing, knowing she could not escape.<br>
<br>
&quot;And then Evil became stronger.  She fed off of Mahtim's life and spawned her own creatures, which were born form foul places and terrorized the surface. When Humans were created, the Last Race created, Evil found a new way to make her presence known.<br>
<br>
&quot;She came to the Princess Sanya of Osiria, the Second Kingdom, in the form of a great sorceress, for she is the Queen of Sorcery.  She tricked the girl into killing her brother, who was the lover of Princess Katarina, the heir to the Dratilian throne and the Keeper of The Falcon.  She knew that if she held this Heart Of Dragons, as it was often called, in her possession, she could summon Maiem, the First Mother Dragon, and her children, and have them do her bidding.  But KAtarina killed Sanya and then herself, and the Heart was lost forever.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're still trying to find it.  If we get to it before Evil does, we can stop her form destroying MAhitm.  Right now, the Goddess lives in the shell of Sorceress Artema.  She is extremely powerful, but if she were ever to surface from her prison, the world would be doomed.  Her brethren are no longer here, because they died long ago.  Without them, she cannot be controlled, if she were ever to surface and obtain the Token.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cedric took a deep breath.  &quot;Well, that's it in a nutshell.  Any questions?&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Lord Faro had told me of this Sorceress Artema and her daughter Athena but now it makes more sense, but what is her objective here?&quot; Mirak remarked. &quot;So are you sure have no idea were the token is?&quot; Mirak asked but quickly swung his body around and started into the distance as he felt an enormous power near his Lord Faro. &quot;It is familiar some how,&quot; Mirak whispered.<br>

And now that she is angered, her strength is growing day by day.  There are a lot of sorceresses on Mahtim, you see. Soem good, some bad.  But there is only one dominant sorceress at any given time.  Artema is without question the dominant sorceress right now, and will remain that until another sorceress overpowers her and takes her place.  There was Lunadra, Raven, Mortasieth, and Azalea.  Now Artema is one.  It is a theory that all the dominant sorceresses were possessed by Evil.  But she must have picked a really good shell this time.  But there's also a theory that the Gods create the Paladai, or paladins, to overcome these sorceresses. The first Paladai was the Siren Laurena.  the second was Ayaka.  We just have to find the Third Paladai, locate the Token, and we may have a fighting chance.&quot;  He smiled weakly.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Hey, you okay? you look like you've seen a ghost.&quot;  <br>

<br>
**********<br>
<br>
Kyonae undressed and slipped into the bath.  The water was deliciously cold and brought sharpness back to her senses.  She began to wash her wounds and cuts clean when she heard the steady pace of Naomi's staff leading into the bathroom and closing the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you alright, Kyonae?&quot; she asked, setting down her staff as she sat down on an old wheelchair that had been left there by Cedric's grandmother.  <br>
<br>
Kyonae nodded, cleansing the dirt out of a grisly gash in her shoulder.  She did not mind Naomi seeing her this way, being a fellow female, and truthfully she considered her a sister.  A wiser, silent, cynical sister.  Besides, years of warrior mage instincts had taught her not to be ashamed of being unclothed in front of others...privacy was a luxury not always enjoyed.  As she washed the wounds clean, she whispered gentle spells, welding them together instantly.  &quot;Yes.  Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was merely curious.  Iaret poison is very toxic.  If he had gotten you...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...I would not be here, Naomi,&quot; she finished, sealing a long scratch along her neck.  &quot;I was fortunate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That you were.  But forgive me.  I digress.&quot;  Naomi made eye contact with her.  &quot;I have come to talk to you about Mirak.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know what you would say,&quot; Kyonae said, washing the blood out of her hair.  &quot;And I'm not saying you're wrong.  But whether we can trust him or not is not an issue.  He agreed to come with us, to destroy Artema.  I have no doubt it is for his own advantage.  But we need help...and he has done nothing to prove himself treacherous.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kyonae,&quot; Naomi said gently.  &quot;I just wish to say that you should be wary.  He has the right to know about Evil.  He has the right to know about the Falcon, and he has every right to know about you and you being a Paladai.  But...&quot; she paused.  &quot;So does Menion.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kyonae sighed.  &quot;I know he does,&quot; she whispered, looking at her reflection in the slightly bloodied water.  &quot;But unlike Mirak...he cannot understand.  Mirak does not feel...he does not care beyond his own terms...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And Menion does care, is that what you're saying?&quot; Naomi mused.  &quot;I agree with you.  He cares more than you think.  And maybe he wouldn't understand.  But he would try...for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kyonae closed her eyes to her reflection.  She felt Naomi's hand place itself on her healed shoulder, and when she opened her eyes again, Naomi's face was beside her own in the water.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are your friends, Kyonae Falcona.  We will do anything in our power to help you on this journey.  That is no trifle burden you bear, I know.  And there is not one among us who would not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>help</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you bear it.<br>
<br>
&quot;But you must understand...Menion is the only one among us who would try to carry it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>for</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you, no matter what you did.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Kyonae's eyes slid shut, burning.  Two teardrops fell into the water and blurred their reflections.<br>
<br>
She knew.  And it killed her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 232<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/16/03 9:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm90.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cedric's Place</span><hr size=1> Mirak stood silently in the house searching for the token with his magic but so far he hadn't found it.
