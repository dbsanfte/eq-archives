<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ben threw Vania forward, her body slamming hard into the pavment, ripping open the loose cotton fabric of her pants, skining up her knees pretty bad. He took his time wiping Vania's spit from his face, but before she ever had the chance to jump up Sarah's heel dug sharply into the small of her back. Vania's upper torso was yanked up hard, Sarah grabbing her loosening braid and yanking up on it. Blood dripped down from Vania's seemingly broken nose, yet all she could do was seeth in anger, not pain as the two vampires argued with one another. She stood no chance, not having a single weapon on her. She was cursing herself for leaving her daggers and her gun.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sarah: &quot;Why don't we just kill the little tramp?&quot;<br>
Ben: &quot;Believe if I was allowed to kill the little bitch I would Sarah, you could have her any way you wanted. But you heard what Isabella said, bring her in one peice.&quot;<br>
Sarah: &quot;I don't see what Isabella wants with her, the little tramp doesn't even speak, not even a yelp in pain.&quot;<br>
Ben: &quot;Come on Sarah enough horsen around, Isabella is going to be pissed, and personally I don't want to burst into flames before I can even blink my eyes.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sarah pushed Vania's face back into the ground, a sickening crack sounding, if her nose wasn't broken before, it sure as hell is now. Sarah then kicked Vania in the side, her steel toed boot causing a low grunt to emerge from Vania though it was barely audable as Vania held back from saying anything, making a single sound, she knew too much to let them on that she could speak. She hoped they would kill her before they took her where ever it was this Isabella resided. Vania was then jerked to her feet quickly, Ben's hand yanking her up, twisting her arm far behind her back, nearly breaking it. The pain was searing, but she bit it all back, not even tearing from the pain. She could only seeth in her own anger, anger that if they found out everything she knew, everything, everything the rebellion had worked so hard for would be destroyed in an instance. Her eyes searched, not for escape, but for death, but she saw nothing, no way to get out of this one. All Vania could think of were those little children that lived in her corridor, their smilling faces, their laugh...Enough to make her loath everything in the world. She had lost faith in God a long time ago, how could there be a God, how? How could a God let those children be slaughtered...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stevendeschain>Steven Deschain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/7/03 11:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Intervension of Fate?</span><hr size=1> Deschain slowly moves out from a shadowed corner, his ice blue eyes almost shining in the darkness.

He sneaks up behind the one holding the girl and quickly pulls the desert eagle pistol from the holster under his leath jacket and wraps his left arm around Ben's neck, poing the powerful piston into Ben's back just behind his heart.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now what do you think you are doing here?&quot;  Steven growls at the other vampire near him and bars his teeth, pressing the gun harder into Ben's back.<br>

Though none the less he practically throws Vania at Sarah, the other vamp catching Vania by the hair and yanking her back to catch her arm, wondering what the hell is going on. Vania only takes in a sharp breath from the pain, not caring anymore, only praying her death will be here, and those children won't suffer. Anyway she looks at it, she is dead.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

He is no young bloodling, he has some of Isabella's blood coursing through him, he is strong as strong as any vampire that has lived to see nearly two centuries. He does his best to knock the man onto his back his fangs extending, his eyes glowing a bright crimson as a hidious hiss emits from his throat. Sarah on the other hand runs, her steps quick and light, though Vania slows her. She is not carrying Vania, Vania is dragged by her hair, her feet giving out underneith her several times, not able to run at such speeds. Though she never falls completly, her hair is the only thing keeping her from falling. Though for the first time she fights back, flailing at Sarah, praying to knock her off balance. Sarah is not strong like Ben, her strength is her speed. If Vania could knock her off balance she would stand a chance.<br>
<br>
Finally one of her blows lands and both women smash hard into the ground, only Vania is up first,blood running down her face, down her knee's her shoulder banged up badly, and yet she stands there ready to fight Sarah, a dangerious gleam in her eyes.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stevendeschain>Steven Deschain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/7/03 11:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Intervension of Fate?</span><hr size=1> Steven growls loudly as Ben connects, knocking him back just a bit.

He quickly fires one shot from the eagle, the powerful bullet slamming through the other vampires back and into her heart.  He smiles to himself before looking back to Ben.  He holsters the pistol and looks at Ben, slowly starting to circle around him, his arms crossing over his chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are we having fun yet?&quot;<br>
<br>
Steven cracks his neck quietly and extends his right arm slowly, his other placed against his lower back.  He flattens his hand out, his palm facing up.

Her eyes merely turn to the two remaining vampires. She does not run as most would in such a situation instead she lets her mere curiousity take over. Why would another vampire stop this, stop their chance of taking over everything, regaining eternal power. Ben on the other hand seems frightened now, he knows he is outmatched. But his first priority is to get Vania to Isabella alive. So instead of fighting, standing his ground he turns and runs right for Vania, his hand is outstretched to grab Vania who is rather far away, even with his speed. Vania does not move, her pace is no match for vampire, whether they have just been turned or not. <br>
<br>
Instead she braces herself for the impact, yet she is in a stance where if he somehow would make it to her she has the option to knock him flat on his back. The only words that escape his mouth before running head on at Vania are directed at no one inperticular.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Deschain extends his arm as he almost appears out of no where infront of Ben.  His forearm connects with Ben's throat, sending the vampire flat to his back.  He growls loudly and grips Ben's arm, bending hit behind him as Steven rolls him onto his stomach, putting his knee into Ben's lower back.<br>

She clicks off the safty and keeps it read at her hand, though she has no intention of using it on either of these two, but on herself.

Isabella then placed the gun to the side of her head and slowly began to back awya from the only vampire remaining, least he should get the idea of using her to get into this so called Isabella's good graces. Though most humans would have a gleam of fear, or insanity to do as she is. Though Vania's gaze is intence, serious, she knows exactly what she is doing.

Humans are but cattle, they must learn their place rebel.This girl won't even live to see another day for she fights for one thing and only one thing, which I have already destroyed. If you will not bring her to me she will only die by her own hands. If it is your wish to save such a pathetic waste of life then bring her to me, I do not wish to kill her. I mean to take her under my wing, she has great possibilities. Surely you could see that. What human remains as calm as she is facing nearly 20 vampires. None, not even a whole army remains as calm as she is. She is a bred killer. Now bring her to me, and I will bless you with my blood.[/i] Isabella is correct in that Vania is strange. No human would stand there back to back with another vampire, regaurdless if he had just saved her life, pointing a gun steadily at one target completely surrounded. Even though she did tremble slightly it is almost absurb to think that is her only reaction to the situation at hand.
