With silence from beyond the grave he glided over the puked stained carpet and noticed the tags on the walls, &quot;Fuck Life!&quot; and &quot;V is the place to be&quot;. Penetraiting deeper into the darkness, he passed into the second room. There on a faded unadorned matress was his reason for coming to this pit, a young girl, perhaps in her late teens, was shaking violently on the makeshift pallet. She seemed to be sleeping, but it was anything but restful, her soft moaning could almost be mistaken for a lament.<br>
<br>
His servants had directed him to this place, she had been seen following them, had even glimpsed the fire fight after last gather. Her death should appease the darkness for awhile. <br>
<br>
As if her non-verbal laments were as a hymn to the pale faced creature that stood before her, he closed his eyes and started to remove the ritualistic trapping from the small briefcase he carried.<br>
<br>
First the red paint for the circle, then the four black candles in reference to the points, the knife came next with the gold of the snake handle shinning just a bit in the harsh steet lamp light that penetrated the loose fitting boards of the shack, and lastly, the cup. Oh the cup, it had been a gift from his sire. It's origons were in egypt, or so he had been told. The carvings on it were exquisite, a snake wraped around the handle with it's mouth forming the opening.<br>
<br>
Her moaning reached a creshendo and he lit the candles, averting his eyes from the hateful flame. The sulfur filled his nose and he glared at her. The small warmth had awoken her and she stared drunkenly at him, &quot;Wha do 'ou wan?&quot; she slurred.<br>
His eyes met hers and she froze.<br>
The vampire's smile did not touch the large golder orbs that were his eyes. He spoke in very slow tones, but rythmicly, as if his voice would entrance her further.<br>
&quot;I've come to see if you're worthy. Not many can be sacrificed to the darkness.&quot; Motioning to the tracks in her arms and the needles strewn about the floor, he continued, &quot;You seem to be his kind of sort, but I'm afraid you may just be a dabbler, not truely upon his path.&quot; He smiled his chilly smile and despite her paralysation, she shuddered inside and out. &quot;So I put this question to you, why did you start?&quot; <br>
His eyes returned to normal and she immidiatly straightened up, her back against the wall, but she couldn't tear her gaze from his. In hushed tones and stuttered words she breathed, &quot;For the expierence.&quot; One eyebrow slowly lifted and his face became stone, no emotion, no movement. His hollow eyes bore into her skin, mind, and soul. These were open books to him. His face relaxed and his smile was alarmingly disarming. Slowly raising his hand to her, she flinched, but kept eye contact.<br>
&quot;What is your name?&quot; he asked in a quiet voice. It seemed as if she couldn't resist him, &quot;Mia.&quot; she said then swallowed. He nodded, once, and his arm shot out from where it had come to rest in the air in front of her. <br>
He brutally grabbed her by the face, covering her mouth as she tried to scream.<br>
With superhuman strenth he lifted her off the ground, his fingers were as cold and ice and they seemed to puncture her cheeks. It didn't seem like he moved, but she was suddenly deposited in the circle. The fall knocked the wind out of her and as she lay there gasping, he started what seemed to be a chant, &quot;Knowledge in darkness, secrets lain bare, don't believe what's hidden will ever escape his stare...&quot;<br>
she looked up at him as the knife came down, once, twice, thrice. For some reason she wasn't screaming. She'd never been stabbed before and the quick pain was almost a religious expirence. It brought warmth and awarness. She knelt in front of him, waiting for the final blow. It never came. <br>
Her eyes opened and he was gone, as if he had dissapered. She wasn't dreaming though, there was the blood, the candles, and then his quiet laughter as he remateiralized in front of her. He still had the knife, but now he turned it on himself and she was mesmerized as he brought the wound to her mouth, &quot;All the secrets you wish can be attained if one takes the first step onto a path half known, but always present.&quot;<br>
With that, she drank and the warmth really took over, and then the darkness along with the faintest wispers of all her wildest imagnings.<br>
<br>
Serpadil exited the hovel, he motioned to one of his servants and it went inside. Quickly it exited with a human sized velvet bundle in its massive arms. &quot;Put her in the car and then take us home, we've found you a sister this night.&quot;<br>
<br>
Serpadil reflected on the mysteries of his God. He had thought this one would be his indulgence in glutony, but had been revealed as the perfect tool to begin his next stage. The darkness worked in mysterious ways, all hail Set. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stephencrowley>Stephen Crowley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/6/03 6:01:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: reverse lighting</span><hr size=1> OOC: Very, very nice.
