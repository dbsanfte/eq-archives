Apparently, the Unitarian church grew out of a belief by some that there is no biblical basis for the Trinity, which was established as part of Christian dogma in 325 CE (at the Council of Nicea).  I not only have never read the Bible all the way through, but I was raised Congregationalist which apparently doesn't think much of the Trinity since (despite years of Sunday school) I never heard the term used until a Protestant Traditions class in college.  Can those more enlightened than I make the argument for and against the Trinity?  (And apologies if this has already been discussed).  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But I believe the concept to be taught in the Bible.  I also believe that there are two biblical truths which are evident, with the logical conclusion being the Trinity...<br>
<br>
1) There is one God.<br>
2) There are 3 distinct persons who are God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
My scriptures for these two truths - <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>One God</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Deuteronomy 6:4 - &quot;Hear O Israel, The Lord our God, the Lord is one&quot;<br>
<br>
Jesus quoted this in Mark when asked which commandment was the foremost of all.  Although Paul taught strongly on the deity of Christ, he said emphatically, &quot;there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live&quot; (1Cor. 8:6).  From beginning to end, I see Scripture speak of one God and label all other gods as false.<br>
<br>
I believe the Bible also recognizes a plurality of persons in God.  Although not as clear in the Old as is in the New Testament, there are passages where members of the Godhead are distinguished (Ps. 110:1)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Father is God</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Throughout Scripture, God is said to be a Father.  Jesus taught us to pray &quot;Our Father in heaven&quot;.  He is not only referred to as &quot;our Father&quot;, but also &quot;the Father&quot; and is also called &quot;God and Father&quot;.  Additionally, God is referred to as the &quot;Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Son is God</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I believe Jesus claimed to be Yahweh God. (YHWH / Jehovah)  In John 8:58 Jesus declares &quot;Before Abraham was, I am.&quot; claiming existence before Abraham, but also equality with the &quot;I AM&quot; of Ex. 3:14...The Jews understood this because they wanted to stone him for blaspheming.<br>
<br>
The OT forbids giving worship to anyone other than God but yet Jesus accepted it.  The disciples attributed to him title that the OT reserved for God (First and Last).  They also used titles of deity for Jesus (John 20:28 ).  Paul, Titus, and the writer of Hebrews did this as well (Col. 2:9, Titus 2:13, Heb. 1:8 )  John 1:1 minces no words saying, &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word as with God, and the Word [Jesus] was God&quot;<br>
<br>
Jesus claimed equality with God in other ways...he claimed to be Judge of all, although Joes quotes yahweh as being the judge of every nation. (Matt. 25:31-46; Joel 3:12)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Holy Spirit is God</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Acts 5:3-4<br>
He possesses attributes of deity, such as omnipresence and omniscience.  He is associated with other members of the Trinity under the &quot;name&quot; of God (Matt. 28:18-20).  The Holy Spirit appears, along withthe Father ans Son, in NT benedictions (2 Cor. 13:14)<br>
<br>
The Holy SPirit is a distinct person in that the Bible refers to &quot;him&quot; (John 14:26), he does things only persons can do, such as teach (John 14:26) and convict of sin (JOhn 16:7-7)<br>
<br>
***********<br>
Just a few more side notes:<br>
<br>
I believe the 3 members of the Trinity are distinct in that each is mentioned in distinction from the others.  The Son prayed to the Father, the Father spoke from heaven about the Son at his baptism.  The Holy Spirit was present at the same time, revealing that they co-exist.  <br>
<br>
I believe the separate titles (Father, Son, and Spirit) indicate 3 separate persons that each have special functions.<br>
<br>
God has one essence and 3 persons (or one &quot;What&quot; and 3 &quot;Whos,&quot; if you will).  God is a unity of essence with a plurality of persons, each different, yet sharing a common nature.<br>
<br>
I believe that Matthew 28:19 affirms the Trinity seeing that Jesus did not say baptize them into the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>names</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, but into the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>name</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
Simone - This is just a real quick look, and I know that I didn't list every single scripture verse for each instance, so if there are any you would like, let me know.  I may also look at this in the morning, and think, &quot;Huh?  What was I doing?&quot;  (It's been a rough evening here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

Since this is sometimes used in a way that indicates the creator or creators, some people interpret it either as a royal plurality (the royal &quot;We&quot;, if you will, often used by Monarchs to indicate theirself [long unrelated aside deleted]), others interpret it as being a reference to the three-in-one personages of Christianity, only properly understood in light of the NT Jesus man-god. While others understand the plurality of Elohim as being a relic of ancient Hebrew polytheism, that couldn't be edited out during the shift to the ethical monotheism of &quot;modernish&quot; (tho' still quite ancient) Judaism.<br>
<br>
There's also a bit of a quandry about an NT passage that is most probably a later insertion used to support the Trinity concept. (1 John 5.7 - 5.8. See <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.bibletexts.com/kjv-tr.htm#3" target="top">this link</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> to see a discussion about Erasmus, the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, and the passage in question.)<br>

We believe that they are 3 distinct beings who are one in purpose and work as one to bring about the immortality and eternal life of man. We believe that they are all diety, but THE God is God the Father.<br>
<br>
The first basis for this argument is that the founder of our church Joseph Smith had a vision at the age of 14 where both the Father and the Son visited him.  Our  scriptures BoM (writings of Prophets on the American Continent from 600 bc to 400 AD) and Pearl of Great Price (writings of Moses and Abraham) back this up.  <br>
<br>
Specifics in the bible include : Acts 7:56  where Stephen before he died saw &quot;the Son of Man (Jesus) standing at the right hand side of God&quot;<br>
<br>
When Christ was baptized, He was standing in the water, the Father was in Heaven and spoke and said how pleased He was with His Son, at the same time the Holy Ghost descended upon Jesus. Three distinct individuals in 3 different places. (Mathew 4:16-17)<br>
<br>
When Christ was in the Garden of Gethsemene, He prayed to his Father.  He said not MY will but THY will be done (two separate people with two separate wills) yet He was willing to bend to the Fathers will knowing why it had to be done.  (Luke 22:42)  In Mathew he went on to clarify how He and the Father are one. (John 17:21) <br>
&quot;That they may all be one, as thou Father art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us:...&quot;<br>
<br>
When Jesus was on the Cross, The Father withdrew His presence/spirit from Jesus because Christ had to do it alone. (Mark 15:34) Christ called to Him and asked why He had forsaken Him.<br>
<br>
When Christ taught the people how to pray he taught them to pray to God the Father in His name.  He is the mediator between us and the Father.  He did not teach us to pray to Him.  After He was risen he did accept worship of himself.  LDS do worship Him as our Savior and Redeemer, but we pray to the Father in His name.<br>

There are more, but I'll stop for now.  The Unitarians actually grew out of the belief of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>majority</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that there was no Trinity, that Jesus was man.  The majority of priests weren't preaching the trinity before Constantine, and the Trinity was actually frowned on, until Constantine paid the bishops to come to the council and then locked them in until they agreed.  Many in their own writings recanted their agreement with the Trinity afterwards.  Arius didn't.  He stood his ground and never agreed- which is why he's mentioned more.  He's one of those bishops who was taught by bishops that Jesus was man.  After the council it was heresy.  It wasn't before.  Most UU's look at that and say- ummmmm, no one in the 300 yrs after his death really believed Jesus was God- until Constantine forced it;  he rewrote the religion and reinterpreted the Bible to suit his needs. (that's when Sunday became the sabbath, when Easter was picked...)  That's why UU's look at the words of Jesus as equal with like Aristotle, the Buddah... the people at the time did too.<br>

I don't see how this passage recognizes plurality of of God.  Psalm:110:1 The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is:<br>
“Sit at my right hand Until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.”  I take this as Him talking to someone else like Jesus.<br>

Now here, I believe that Jesus is just claiming that he existed before Abraham.  This is totally possible if you believe that Jesus was the first spirit creature ever created by Jehovah, this is the belief of Jehovah's Witnesses.  Thus making Jesus even more of a connection between God and God's Son, meaning that Jesus knows God's will.<br>

&quot;Arius said there is one God, not a trinity, and that Jesus is not truly God but, in effect, a demigod. He is a created being of greater rank than humans but not equal to the Father. The Arian position is equivalent to that of Jehovah's Witnesses today.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trish, is this a fairly accurate reference to JW?<br>

Ever hear of demonic possession? Demonic possession is possession by a demon from Satan. The Holy Ghost is the same concept, only purporting that the possession is by a spirit from God (Yahweh).<br>
<br>
Ever have an emotion flood through your body, either anger or love or lust? Ever have an &quot;Aha!&quot; experience, where an idea or concept floods through your mind (and you can actually feel it), and all of a sudden something makes sense?<br>
<br>
The concept of the Holy Ghost is that it is the mechanism whereby the spirit or goodness of God is able to enter a human being's spirit.  That's the way the ancients explaned what to them was unexplainable: sudden changes in personality.<br>

If god's &quot;spirit&quot; is a separate entity, does that translate to the belief that a mortal's spirit is also a separate entity?  Is that the thing that is believed to go to heaven?  To have eternal life?<br>

<br>
We also believe that we are all the &quot;spirit children&quot;of God and that we existed with him in a spirit form (looking like we do now but of a finer matter) before the creation of the earth.<br>
<br>
In order to grow and progress, it was imperative that we gain a body of flesh and bone. So the earth was created to give us this opportunity.  Jesus was the first born Spirit Son of God and is part of the Godhead.  The Holy Ghost is another of our brothers and is part of the Godhead (kind of like a Presidency if you will with God as the President and Jesus and the Holy Ghost as His counsellors) acting with one purpose and the counsellors having the authority of God to act in His name to bring about His will.<br>
<br>
We believe that the spirit and the physcical body united are who we are while here in this life. When we die the spirit leaves the body and goes to a place to await the resurrection or the reuniting of the spirit and the newly made perfect body that we had while here.<br>
<br>
When Christ was on the cross, He prayed and said that he was comending His spirit to God. (leaving his body)   it says that He gave up the ghost (or His spirit) (Luke 23:46 <br>
<br>
After Christ was resurrected he asked the disciple to give him something to eat.  They had  fish and honeycomb and he ate it to show them that he really did have His physical body back.  He also showed them the actual wounds in his hands and feet and in his side. Luke 24:39-43<br>
<br>
One of the things that to me has always make sense is that the spirit is the energy or life force that is with us while we are alive How it actually works in connection with the elctrical aspect or the chemistry of our bodies, I am looking forward to learning about.  But when I have seen dead people and in my work I have seen a 'few'.  It is just a cold stiff shell.  The person that they are isnt there anymore.   One of the examples we used to use as missionaries was the examlple of a hand and a glove.  without the hand the glove is not animated and cannot do anything on its own.  but you slip the hand in there and Ouila you have animation and movement and yet it is still just a glove.  You take your hand out of the glove  or the spirit out of the body and .... no more animation. Its just the shell.  The hand in the glove or our spirit in our bodies is what makes us alive - It is the power source if you will for our bodies.   anyway more to chew on.....<br>

<br>
That's where you have to ask each individual sect.<br>
<br>
I once asked a Fundamentalist Christian I worked with what kind of body was supposed to be existent in paradise, and he said he didn't know, but that it would be &quot;perfect&quot; and that we'd be able to recognize each other (through some means we can't understand in our current form). Of course, I asked my question in the following way, or some such:<br>
<br>
&quot;So tell me, this new body you get in heaven, what kind of chemistry is involved? How is the DNA and proteins and etc. different from what we have on earth?&quot;<br>
<br>
I could have gone on to ask: &quot;How does the energy transfer from sunshine to plants to us work differently? How do bones and joints and muscles refresh themselves to avoid wear and tear?&quot;<br>
<br>
My father had a quandry (he was a Lutheran throughout his life) about the age of the body in heaven. Would it be that of an infant, a person in their 20's, an old man in his 70's?<br>

This is very similar to how I think about our energy or life force.  Are you sure you're not a pagan??  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Did you think I meant He was the first born spirit at the time he was born physically?<br>
<br>
We really dont have an idea of how long we were &quot;hanging out&quot; in the pre-mortal existance, but my guess is that is was a very very very long time.  I personally believe that the 7 creative periods were not literally days and that it took a LONG time to create the Earth and we were all there with God before He even started creating it.  <br>
<br>
LDS belief is that at some future point in time after the resurrection, Husbands and wives will create their own &quot;kingdoms&quot; (Universes) and have spirit children and that the cycle will continue.  In Gods family His first born was Jesus. and the rest of us followed being created  in spirit form and eventually we would come to this life and get a physical body.  All the people born here are our brothers and sisters.<br>
<br>
The difference between us and Christ is among other things (not being perfect and all) that He was not born of two mortal parents.  His mother was human with all the frailties of our fallen state, and His father was God, being put in the womb by the Holy Ghost, not to be crude or disrespectful in anyway, I see it as a Godly form of INvitro.  So he had the traits of Human, able to die, and the traits of God, able to be immortal.  So not only was He the first spirit born of God the Father, but He was the ONLY physical son to be born of  God. This very trait allowed him to accomplish the Atonement. <br>
(ok tangent here, but I felt it explained how he was the first born)<br>
