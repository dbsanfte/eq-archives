<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He is there - stretching, readying his body and mind for the sparring. His opponent is quiet impressive, but no match to Tyr, and I have no doubts that Tyr will win this battle and reap his prize - the mating proposal from a female. It is just what he desires - the start of a big family, plenty of superior children and grandchildren, all with perfect Kodiak genes. Don't get me wrong - I wish him all this, I really do - he deserves his dream after everything he had to go through. I just wish that his dream would include me in it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Kodiak is impressive - he would be a good addition to the Pride gene pool would he win. I am certain, that he will succeed - his suppressed desire to obtain a mate will drive him. Narim was foolish to challenge him and deserves his unavoidable death in this battle. Some males have to learn that the true superiority includes the ability to avoid the battle you can not win... Unfortunately for such males, sometimes this lesson ends their lives too. We, females, need the best specimen to mate with. I step forward to give a sign and the match begins.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Kodiak is a clever combatant, I have to give him that! Looks like he is way too confident in his superiority. He fights too clean, like this is not a fight to death, but a sparring match in the gym. I can use it to my advantage... I swap his legs from under him and he falls on his back, totally helpless. Ha! I got him now! But it is too soon to end a battle - I will not kill him just yet. Toria is watching and I have to show her how ruthless I am with my enemy...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Males! They will give everything to be chosen by a superior female such as myself! Narim has good genes, but he is pretty short-minded. His ability to outthink his opponent is pathetic. Looks like he is really thinking that he has the Kodiak defeated! But Kodiak is not helpless - Narim carelessly approaches him and Kodiak's bone blades perforate his throat. Obviously, Tyr Anasazi is better specimen then Narim. I come forward to the winner and look him over. The offspring from breeding with him would be explicit! I say: &quot;Tyr Anasazi, I choose you as my mate.

The Nietzschean female, Toria, is approaching me with her mating proposal and she is waiting for my answer, staring at me arrogantly. She knows nothing about me and yet she is so sure in my answer - amazing! And I respond: &quot;I decline.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

This male is obviously inferior! Good thing he is just an outsider, or his words would have been bad for my breeding status in the Pride. There is no way I am going to waste my time staying here anymore! I need to go check out really superior specimens!

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He declines? What about his dreams, his desires, his Pride, full of little Tyrs? And why is he looking at me with this unreadable expression on his face? Can it be that he somehow knows about my feelings? Can it be that he, too, feels something for me? Can it be that he was fighting to impress me, not her? I want it to be so, but... I hear his words again: &quot;Never in the million years. Not ever.&quot; I watch the female leaving. Her genes were probably not good enough. Yeah, he probably just thinks her inferior, that's all.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He declines? This is most strange and most unfortunate - my Pride needs new genes and his genes are excellent breeding stock. I saw many males on the arena during my days as a Pride Matriarch and there is always a reason for their actions. Tyr Anasazi will explain his reason soon, of that I am sure. I think I know what he is about to say - the way he looks at his blond Human companion is an open book. Most unfortunate. Toria is infuriated, of course.

Why wait? She is here, I am here, and the Matriarch is here too. If Beka will agree, we can become mates tonight.

Why am I so insecure when it comes to Tyr? After all, the worst he can tell is &quot;no&quot;. Oh, and give me that lecture on how crossbreeding is a ridiculous concept and how he'll never, ever... Then I'll know for sure. Yeah, it is probably what I should do - approach him like that female and inquire arrogantly &quot;Tyr Anasazi, I choose you as my mate.

What's on her mind? I am so caught in admiring her that I miss her first words, and then the meaning of them starts to dawn on me. &quot;I want to marry you, Tyr. What about you?&quot;, she asks, her face arrogant, impatient and awkward at the same time. I stare at her like a fool. Then I nod, still speechless. She takes my hand and leads me to the Matriarch.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This Human is so feisty and bold I can almost respect her. Of course, her courage doesn't make her genes any better, but she has a nerve... Anasazi's response doesn't surprise me this time - once the male decided which female he wants, he will never decline her mating proposal. They are approaching me - probably want me to marry them. Well, since I can now forget about adding his genes to my Pride, I may as well do it. Why not? Pride females can't have him now anyway - he will probably remain monogamous for life with a wife like this one.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Certainly, Beka didn't have a spare double helix, but her simple necklace, now fastened around my arm, will do until we get the real helixis. My wife is looking at me, her eyes somewhat uncertain and I realize that she, too, can't actually believe in what is going on. I wrap my arms around her protectively and she steps into my embrace, suddenly becoming a female, not a starship captain.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Tyr Anasazi is my husband. Husband. My. My husband. Weird. Unbelievable almost. We, Valentines, are strange family, but this beats everything. Just how did I get the guts to propose? And why did he accept? This was unexpected... Nietzscheans take this mating thing seriously, so it can't be a game on his part, can it? I look into his eyes, afraid to see that unreadable expression again, but his gaze is disbelieving, insecure almost. As if he, like me, shocked by this sudden marriage. He notices my anxiety and pulls me tightly to him. I eagerly snuggle into his warmth.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
