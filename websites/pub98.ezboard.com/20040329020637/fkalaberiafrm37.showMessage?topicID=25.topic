<br>
Personallity: Laid back to a degree, loves action however but it takes a lot to upset him. Is a fighter by nature and well skilled in various martial arts forms (see skills for more info) Loves the female population and is a womanizer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Skills and Strengths</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Atomic Mind: A skill that allows him to mentally confuse, distract or disorient someone, works on all mortals, effects vary on vampires and were creatures based on their own skills but atomic mind will still have an effect on them. The effects can last longer or shorter based on strength of the reciever.<br>
<br>
Mind's Black Eye: A skill that allows him to speak into the mind of one vampire, human or other while other vampires with mind skills no matter how powerful can not read.<br>
<br>
Faint Of Body And Soul: When used this skill grants him the ability to vanish from the eye of those that watch him even if he is not moving at all. It also tricks the mind into second guessing itself if maybe he really was not there in the first place.<br>
<br>
Shadow of Darkness: Can turn into a mist or shadow and vanish without form for short distances, can also turn one person in contact with him at that time into a shadow or mist. <br>
<br>
Physical ability: Spent years studing Kung Fu and Kick Boxing, prefers the stronger aggressive forms of fighting over style. Because he is strong and quick, his blows can hurt any foe.<br>
<br>
Other Vampire Skills: Natural ones like healing his bite marks, moving faster then a mortal can see, Reading minds and heal minor wounds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Weaknesses </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
All of his skills when used draina certain amount of energy from him. Depending on the strength length or force of the skill depends on the draining effects. If completely drained David will be very vulnerable to anyone wishing to bring him harm. Shadow of Darkness is perhaps the most draining skill of all expecially if he uses the skill on someone else to move unseen with him.<br>
<br>
Being a vampire, David must feed every night and more then once usually to keep his strength up. In most cases he does not kill his meals however he will use feeding as a weapon to kill if the situation calls for it.<br>
<br>
Also has some usual vampire weaknesses like daylight which will cause him to burst into flames if not protected properly. Requires at least 8 hours of sleep a day. Garlic and holy items have very little effect on him but a slight irriation.<br>
<br>
Massive body wounds, decapitation and blood loss can also kill him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>History</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
David was born a few years before the turn of the century to parents he can not remember for they died of a plague shortly after he was born. Orphaned and alone David was taken in by couple who had lost their son from the same plague that had taken his parents. Life in England for him seemed normal as he grew up into a well mannered gentleman, well learned as best he could in the ways of the world.<br>
<br>
But he wanted more then the simple life he was living so one day he bid farewell to his adoptive parents and set sail for America where he decided to make a living in New York. Because if his height and natural build and strength, he became a dock hand to help unload the ships. He met many people, heard many strange tales and lived a rather fullfilling life until he turned 24.<br>
<br>
It was at that time that he met and fell in love with a sweet new yorker girl who let him move into her home with her. She seemed to have odd habits, staying in by day and going out at night but he was busy with work to notice and he loved her so much he couldn't care. One night in the middle of their passion upon the sheets, Rebecca did something that he could not stop her from doing. Her neck fetish turned real on him and she fed from him until he passed out. When he woke up he felt very different, sick yet powerful and strong at the same time. Rebecca explained it all to him as best she could, telling him she loved him and wanted to spend all eternity with which had driven her to sire him.<br>
<br>
At first he was angry, then frightened as he had to adjust his life style to match his now decided fate. But soon he grew into it, learned to exploit it for his own gain and soon he could not be happier. But his little world came apart when Rebecca was slain by a hunter, waking David to the stark reality that was his life. He swore death to anyone that hated vampires, the hunter being the first on his list to die though he was followed by other hunters. A hunter of the hunters, David roamed New York at night visiting the city's dark underworld and mingling with its inhabitants as the world passed by.<br>
<br>
As New York became darkened by smog and the day no longer existing, David emerged from the underworld to wander with the humans once more. The tides had changed now, it was the humans that hid and David liked this life. By day he no longer had to hide in his appartment and when out driving in his 1997 Corvette, he could now roll down the windows and enjoy the air through his hair.<br>
<br>
Currently David belongs to a group of vampires who seek and destroy hunters while being paid by the vampire crime lords.<br>
