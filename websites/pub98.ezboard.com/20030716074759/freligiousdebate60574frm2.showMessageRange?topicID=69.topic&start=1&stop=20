I know everyone is going to say they don't hate or discriminate against homosexuals, but would you be upset or do anything of you found out your child's first grade teacher were a lesbian or gay man? What would you do?<br>
<br>
All political views and credentials being the same, would you vote for a heterosexual over a homosexual based solely on this difference? What if the homosexual's politics were yours, but the straight guy had policies you didn't like?<br>
<br>
Would you have a gay man babysit your kids (assuming, of course he was wonderful with children and had met them and enjoyed doing it)?<br>
<br>
Would you keep going to a gynecologist if you found out she were lesbian or for guys a male doctor who examined you nude if he were a gay man?<br>
<br>
Those who know me know I'm a total gay rights advocate, but I suspect many of us who claim tolerance and an open mind devoid of fear or hatred for homosexuals can't get past the &quot;dirty perverted sinner&quot; image set forth by years of persecuation and bashing from the religious leaders, texts and just society in general.<br>

<br>
I think that any teacher of children and young adults should not in anyway discuss their sexuality whether gay or straight.  So if it were being dicussed in class, I would absolutely be upset.  As long as the person kept their private life private, it would not bother me.  (with the exception of gym teachers who would be in the locker room with the kids, same as I wouldnt want a male teacher in the girls locker room or a lady in the boys)<br>

I would vote for which ever person I agreed with politically. And whose charachter (honesty, etc) I felt I could trust.<br>

<br>
No because as a rule I do not let men babysit my children at all.  I know that is totally sexist, but the stats are there that show it is more likely that a man will molest a child than a woman/teen girl.  And I do not want to take that risk.<br>

All my docs are men.  But I have to admit that if I did have a female doc and she was lesbian, I might not feel comfortable with that.  I dont really know, because I have never seen a female doc.<br>

I did briefly consider making him my children's guardian. He is awesome now that he has accepted he is gay and has come out of the closet. He was so bitter and sad and pathetic before that - like never bathed or took care of himself. I guess I should say he's one of my closest friends as well. <br>
<br>
But your questions<br>
<br>
If I found out my child's teacher was gay because I saw him/her out with their SO then no it wouldn't bother me in any way at all. If its because they were talking about their sexual orintation in the classroom? Unless one of the children brought it up &quot;Mommy says you are gay&quot; or knowing children and some of their bigotried parents it probably wouldn't come out so nicely , then I would have trouble with it. A teacher should not bring that up at all. I don't have a problem with him address a question by a student - though I would hope he tried to put if off first - but I do have a problem with him brooching the subject.<br>
<br>
I would and have had a gay man babysit my child. Our friend has watched Laurel for alittle bit. I have no problem at all assuming he was good with children. <br>
<br>
I would have no problem continuing to see a gyn who was a lesbian. It would be no difference then seeing a man who is also attracted to women. I have confidence in my doctor's ability to be professional. <br>
<br>
I am for gay rights. I believe if they wish it, they should be allow to marry and share all the benefits of being married, such as insurance. I wish adoption was easier for homosexual men who wish to adopt. <br>

<br>
absolutely non of those incidents would bother me at all, except the teacher thing if it wass not handled properly. as in if a student asked a straight foward question &quot;are you gay&quot;  while it would be prudent to say something like &quot;none ya&quot; if said teacher answered honestly i would not condemn him/her for it, that is assuming we're talking about middle school grades and up, i dont think elementary kids really understand what that sort of thing really means when they say or hear it.  but it would all depend on the situation and how it was handled.  <br>
<br>
i would prob be more likely to vote for a homosexual than a hetero if the issues/values were comparable.  just as i am more likely to vote for a minority candidate or a woman. the benefits of having a diverse political body are obvious.<br>
<br>
right now the only people who watch my kids are the IL's (mostly 16 yo SIL), but i dont see how someones sexuality would affect their responsibility level in terms of being able to care for children.  i also dont believe that men/teenage boys are any less capable of babysitting, hell, mySIL's boyfriend is usually quicker to jump up than she is if one of my boys is getting into something (yes, i allow her boyfriend to be at my place while she is watching the kids) and hes 17.<br>
<br>
haveing a gyn exam done is definately the most uncomfortable thing i have to endure in my life, i cant imagine the dr/midwifes sexuality making it any more horrifying for me than it already is.  and besides what business of mine is it who my dr sleeps with?  i cant imagine finding anything like that out any other way than via rumor, and people who believe rumors, well.....<br>

Both my sisters are gay (one of them took 3rd place in the Women's Open Bodybuilding section at the Gay Games in Sydney), my boss is, and a couple of friends - and frankly, I think gays tend to me more openminded about things.

He babysat my daughter Alex for the first 9 months of her life and a friend of his, who was also gay helped him once and a while.(Him and his life partner own a house near the beach and want my kids to come and spend a week at their house. I have no problem with that. My children are safe with them.) They were wonderful with my kids loved them. I had  no worries whatsoever that anything bad would happen. It would not bother if one of my kids teachers were gay.It not like they are going to try to convert them(unlike some fundi's I know). My BIL is also gay and he lives in England and we are talking about letting my son go over to visit for the summer, next year. As for a doctor, it wouldnt matter either. Yes I would vote for a gay or lesbian politician too.  Sexual preference is a personal choice and should not be judge by society as wrong. Also, I believe you are born gay and that it is not a choice.<br>

A teacher being gay certainly wouldn't be a problem.  <br>
<br>
The only people who babysit my kids are family members....if a family member turned out to be gay - I wouldn't have a problem with them babysitting.  <br>
<br>
As far as politics goes - I don't care what a person does in the privacy of their own home...I'll vote for the person who's policies I agree with.<br>
<br>
Did I miss anything? Basically I do not judge people based on what they choose to do with their own lives in their own bedrooms - what business is it of mine?  It doesn't make the person any different in general, just in that one thing - which lets face it, is a pretty small part of what makes up a person.<br>
<br>
I do not believe that people choose to be gay - I think they are born that way....no scientific evidence for this statement..it is just a personal one.<br>
<br>
Edited to add *** I missed the gyn. one.  We don't have gyn's here (unless you are seeing a specialist for some reason)...it's just your GP who does all that stuff.

If I found out my child's teacher was gay, I would be very uncomfortable with it, but only because I'm uncomfortable with homosexuality - I'll admit it!  But I wouldn't pull my kid out of the class...his teacher is his teacher and I'm not going to go through a huge change in my son's life just to avoid what apparently was meant to be.  (Meaning, this person as my son's teacher, not this person as gay - I don't believe people were created to be gay)<br>

Babysitting - we rarely go out, and if we do, it's dh's parents who babysit.  <br>

Seriously?? You would rather be treated by some perverted sicko (who is male), rather than a woman who happens to be sexually attracted to other women?<br>

Obviously you are entitled to your opinion...but I find that wierd to say the least!<br>
<br>
This reminds me of the whole &quot;she is a lesbian, she must fancy me&quot; thing.  I have always assumed that homosexuals have the same likes and dislikes when it comes to finding people attractive as everyone else.  It's not like a hetrosexual woman fancies every man she sees...why would it be true of a lesbian (fancying every woman she sees?).<br>

I know this brings about the age-old debate on the matter. . . but I have to ask anyway:<br>
<br>
Do you believe you were *created* heterosexual?  Or do you remember one day making a conscious choice about your sexuality, and choosing to be attracted to the opposite sex?  <br>
<br>
If you did not choose your sexuality, why would you believe gays/lesbians did?<br>
<br>
LIke the OP, I am a firm believer in gay/lesbian rights who tires of the outright discrimination cloaked in holy scripture.  Xians have the right to believe what they want. . . but when their intolerant views trample another person's civil rights (as happened recently here in NV, with the landslide defeat of the gay marriage initiative) they've gone too far.  Why should millions of people be made to suffer for the sake of a religious view they don't share?  It's the old your-right-to-punch-me-ends-at-my-nose idea again:  The xian's right to believe homosexuality is an abomination ends where gay/lesbian civil rights begin.  <br>
<br>
And anyone who believes they can &quot;love the sinner, hate the sin&quot; should realize that this *benign* position contributes to a culture of discrimination that has oppressed innocent people for thousands of years.<br>
<br>
As an aside, did any one hear about the case before the Supreme Court, in which two men from Texas were arrested (after an *anonymous* tip-off) for having consensual homosexual sex in the privacy of their home.  My dad and I have a little wager going, because he is convinced Scalia will actually be the vote that swings the decision in favor of reversal.<br>

<br>
&quot;would you be upset or do anything of you found out your child's first grade teacher were a lesbian or gay man? What would you do?&quot;<br>
<br>
Heck, all but maybe ONE of my gym teachers were lesbians and it was never an issue. My HS principal was a lesbian too, and a damn good principal at that. A lot better than the hetero male drunkard that preceded her. So I wouldn't &quot;do&quot; anything.<br>
<br>
&quot;All political views and credentials being the same, would you vote for a heterosexual over a homosexual based solely on this difference? What if the homosexual's politics were yours, but the straight guy had policies you didn't like?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd vote for the candidate whose policies I liked. Period.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you have a gay man babysit your kids (assuming, of course he was wonderful with children and had met them and enjoyed doing it)?&quot;<br>
<br>
My SIL is a lesbian and has a long-term partner, and I have let my 5 year old daughter spend the night at their house. They are good people and my trust in them is absolute. Dd has a blast with her little cousin!<br>
<br>
On the other hand, Dh has a friend at work who is straight, in his 30's, never married, no relationship ever, has major self esteem issues and just LOVES kids. I like him personally but never take him up on his offers to sit because he fits the child molester profile. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would worry more about a priest babysitting than a gay man.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Would you keep going to a gynecologist if you found out she were lesbian or for guys a male doctor who examined you nude if he were a gay man?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure. My lesbian SIL attended both of my last births, you can't get much more personal than that. She was a wonderful birth support person. <br>
<br>
&quot;Those who know me know I'm a total gay rights advocate, but I suspect many of us who claim tolerance and an open mind devoid of fear or hatred for homosexuals can't get past the &quot;dirty perverted sinner&quot; image set forth by years of persecuation and bashing from the religious leaders, texts and just society in general.&quot;<br>

<br>
One of my son's first grade teachers was a lesbian.  She was a great teacher as far as I could tell, he learned a lot and enjoyed class.<br>
<br>
I believe that my highschool health teacher was a gay man.  I can't remember how we knew, I don't think he told us so maybe we were being stereotypical,  but I remember the day when another girl at our table said she told her dad and that he said &quot;no (word I don't care to repeat) is going to be teaching my kid&quot; and I was thinking &quot;what a jerk!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot; (the Dad who said that, I thought the teacher was fine).<br>
<br>
Rumor had it that our junior high gym teacher was a lesbian.  The thought that she might be didn't really bother me, shrug.  Maybe because I figure she's a woman too, she's not seeing anything she doesn't have herself?<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Maybe because women generally aren't as easily &quot;visually stimulated&quot; as men?  Anyway, I just don't remember being personaly uncomfortable by the idea, I was very comfortable around her.  For some reason the idea of a lesbian being in the locker room with girls doesn't bother me as much as a straight man being in there with girls, or a gay man being in a locker room with boys.  I guess it all comes back to men being more &quot;visual&quot; and also more pedaphiles are men.<br>

Unless I thought a person were becoming arroused by examining me, hetero/homo sexual would not matter to me. If someone <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>was</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> getting aroused, straight or gay, I'd be out of there!

All that said, I will admit that when my children were first coming up on school age I was uncomfortable with what the teacher/curriculum situation was going to be.  It mostly stemmed from my lack of understanding on how homosexual attractions come about.  How much is just wired that way from the beginning, is it learned, both??  I didn't know, and I wondered if being in an environment where it was openly accepted and possibly encouraged could cause a child to develop tendancies that wouldn't have otherwise, kwim?  I still don't think we know all the answers to those questions and it probably varies from person to person anyway, but I just don't feel that discomfort any more.  The thing I worry about most now isn't the teacher (like I said, I really liked the one my son had) but that the kids will learn derogatory remarks from other kids and repeat it themselves not understanding what they are saying.  I have no idea what they hear, and I hate to bring up something they wouldn't have heard otherwise, but I also don't want to risk them not understanding what something means and then repeating it, kwim?<br>
<br>
How do you all handle that, I could use some ideas.<br>

No way.  As far as the way I would handle all those situations--sexual preference wouldn't play a part in my decisions on any of them.  The only thing that would influence any decision I make regarding myself or my family is if I thought there was a danger of any kind of sexual abuse, and that really has nothing to do with homosexuality--perverts are perverts no matter which side they're on.<br>

I don't think anyone's sexuality, or religion for that matter, should be a valid and only basis for evaluating someone's political record.  A politician is supposed to respresent the people, if they are putting their beliefs above that of the people, then they don't deserve to be in office.<br>

I used to have a problem seeing a male gyno - until my Dad told me a funny story.  He was on a 2 week sailing trip with a group of guys including a friend who was a gyno, they had brought all the typical 'man show' type things.  They pulled out the Penthouse and the gyno couldn't even look at it because it reminded him too much of 'work'.<br>
