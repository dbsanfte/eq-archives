Chapter 3 part 2<br>
Good bye<br>
<br>
As Michael and Rachel walked into the dimly lit room, they heard beeping from the machines I was on. I saw my beautiful little princess and my darling husband.<br>
Michael approached the bed cautiously not wanting to disturb me, I was awake and staring at the t.v. which was barely audible. Rachel came over and sat in the chair that was next to the bed.<br>
“Mommy?” she asked, “You awake?”<br>
“Yes honey I am.” I said slowly. I could feel the air inflating my collapsed lung. It hurt a lot.<br>
“How are you feeling?” Michael asked placing the flowers in my hands which had no strength to try and reach them. Rachel opened her card, decorated with my lipstick, to show me.<br>
“Is that my lipstick?” I asked hoarsely, the medication has me sicker than a dog. Not sick as a dog, sicker than a dog. Rachel nodded cheerfully as she smile, one of her front teeth were missing. I tried to smile but my body seemed to tired. Michael carefully sat on the bed. He started into my eyes as I looked back, I could tell that some things have been wracking his brain. One was that groupie Lisa Marie Presley. She is the daughter of Elvis. She is always around the studio, our house, she is basically trying to get something that isn’t hers. But anyway two is his HIStory tour, he had taken a break and rescheduled the second leg, he wanted Rachel and I to come along. Now he would have to go alone.<br>
“Sweetheart, can you go ask the nurse if she will go with you to the cafeteria and get something to eat?” Michael asked Rachel pointing to the nurse outside the door.<br>
“Daddy-” Rachel started, “I don’t have any money.”<br>
“Here,” he said digging around in his pocket, “Five dollars and I want my change back.”<br>
“Okay, see you later Mommy. I’m going to get some food.” Rachel said as the nurse took her hand. Michael came over to me and sat in the chair next to my bed. He looked at me. I could feel his eyes even though I couldn’t turn my head.<br>
“I love you Nila. Baby, I’ve been so angry with myself for asking you to come home early. This is all my fault.” He said in my ear. Mmm his voice felt so good to me after hearing the doctors talk to the nurses about gobbledygook. He gently kissed my cheek, and no matter how much pain I was in, I turned my head and he kissed me again. I received his kiss. His lips pressed against mine, so familiar and yet painful.<br>
“I love you too.” I said looking into his tear-filled eyes.<br>
“Baby, I can’t loose you, not now. I don’t want you to go.” He broke into tears again.<br>
“I’m not going anywhere.” I said facing the t.v. again, “You won’t loose me, honey”<br>
“Are you okay?” Michael asked noticing some discomfort in my face.<br>
“No, I need to go to the bathroom.” I said almost in pain. I can’t really move, so holding it is hurting right about now.<br>
Michael quickly ran out to the nurse’s station and grabbed a male nurse.<br>
“She has to go.” Michael said bringing him into the room.<br>
Federico, the nurse, grabbed bed pan and removed the one that was underneath me. He replaced it and I went to the bathroom, all I had to do was urinate, but it was so hard and painful. When I was finished he took the nearly filled bed pan and measured it, wrote down how much it was, then he emptied it into the toilet. He then placed another underneath me just incase I had to go again. Michael sat back down and graced my presence with that smile (You Are Not Alone: when he is talking to Lisa, that smile.) trying to be cheerful, I respectively showed him some type of look tat I was happy that he was there. Rachel was still eating and talking with the nurse. It’s a good thing she wasn’t there when it happened.<br>
“Nila, what- what’s wrong?” Michael asked clearly with a look of fear on his face.<br>
“I- can’t bre-breathe.” I struggled to say, my lung collapsed again.<br>
Michael frantically looked for Federico he found him, told him what was happening. He came in with Dr. Carter, and a team of other doctors.<br>
“Mr. Jackson, I’m afraid you have to step outside.” Federico said calmly trying to get him outside.<br>
“No! I’m not leaving my wife. I’ll move out your way but I’m not going outside.” He said madly. Michael was direct to another chair near the door. Dr. Carter took the tube that was surgically implanted into my lung and breathed into it.<br>
I really couldn’t scream, but the tears were flowing down my cheeks. I was silently screaming. <br>
“I’m sorry, Mrs. Jackson. I’m so sorry.” He said to me noticing the tear. He blew a couple more times, and I was able to breathe again. He closed the open part of the tube, gave me morphine, and said to take it easy. Michael, who was crying the whole time, came back, and looked into my face. It was the look of “Oh My Fuckin’ God!” I cried along with him. When Rachel came back I had to put on my best ‘I’m fine’ face for her. She came over and crawled into Michael’s lap and took my hand in hers.<br>
“I love you, Mommy, did you come to me in my dream?” she asked.<br>
“Yes, I did. I wanted to check up on my sugar bear. I’m sorry it ended the way it did. I couldn’t reach you.” I said holding her hand as best I could. She laid her head on the side of my bed. I closed my eyes and listened to the barely audible t.v. Michael watched both of us sleeping and wept silently. It was around 9:30 when Federico came into check on me. He saw that my eyes were shut, my daughter was sleeping and so was my husband. He lightly tapped Michael on the shoulder. Michael in turn woke Rachel. <br>
“Mommy?” Rachel asked shaking my hand. I didn’t move or open my eyes.<br>
Federico shook me lightly a couple times, and nothing. Michael’s fear and panice came back. Everything on the monitors were fine. <br>
“Dr. Carter, Mrs. Jackson is unresponsive and stable.” He said.<br>
“Damn! She’s in a coma!” he said rushing to my room.<br>
