<br>
I have engaged in debate with several xians and found that the LDS really do take a lot of crap from them. I think they are at the core threatened by the idea that something 'new' can be interjected into their worn and respectable dogma, as the BOM is interpreted to have done. I think it reprehensable, even shameful, that so many Americans do not even know the persecution they subjected their own citizens to as was done to the mormons.<br>
<br>
That said, as an A/A let me respond to some of your very polite, lucid, well reasoned and tolerant comments. It is a peculiarity of the American legal system (and others based on English common law) to need a jury. The German based systems don't, and it is one of the most effective, efficient and common in the world (the other being French based.) The reasoning being that there is an absolute truth out there, which some of your comments seem to lean away from. Irrespective of what 11 witnesses to an accident think the color of the car was, the car was in reality only the one color. This is where the distinction between beleif and reality breaks apart. I can believe it was Red all day long, 10 other witnesses can confirm that 'fact' but if the car was purple, we were all wrong. Just like the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Flat Earth Society</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or those people who don't think we landed on the moon. Their system trains judges extensively as finders of fact and arbiters of law. They have industry listed experts, colligate professionsals, etc as expert witnesses, not some bobble headed parrot spouting whatever theory supports the side paying them. Lawyers are not permitted to coach or even contact a witness before the court has interviewed them and everything is conduced in a meeting room in a less formaal setting. Quite effective if you seek fact over control of the arguments.<br>
<br>
I cannot prove a negative, specifically I cannot prove god does or does not exist. Even Heather the absoluteist favoured child of god knows we wait until we die to get the answer. However, I can disprove any false posative assertion, like the bibble isn't contradictory or xianity is true. You call to question, very existentialisticly and counter-nhilist, that anything we do is other than emotionally based. This is not so. The precepts of logic and reasoning are based on this. You can <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> trust your emotions exclusive of logic. You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>can</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> trust logical and soundly reasoned argumentation that arrives at a conclusion from sound postulates. We are not all Seekers of Truth, because there is only one objective reality and seeking that excludes many of the things people wish to seek. Some are Seekers of Faith who shore up their beleif systems but would never abandon them or reject evidence against them. If a treatment did not cure cancer, I would not subject my child to it over one I knew did cure cancer. Material fact would be required to establish this knowledge (1,980 out of 2,000 people with the same conditon recovered 90% of their tissues in 14 days following this procedure, etc...)  This is the methodology of science and the Seekers of Truth.<br>
<br>
In Truth,<br>

<br>
While I wish I had thought out my post, it was mostly rambling!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Anyway, I totally agree with you that there is absolute fact. The problem is, even in the example of the purple car, unless you actually have the car to be able to check what color it is, all you have to go on is the 10 witnesses who say it was red. This is a big problem with religious debate or discussion (I like the discussion, don't get me wrong!).  Because we don't have anyone here on earth who knows absolutely and can prove once and for all whether there is an existance of God, all you have to go on is all the different witnesses and their widely varied accounts of what color the car is! Or whether there is was a car at all! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As far as everything being based on emotion, I did not mean to imply that this was the case. Certainly we need to use our brains in order to determine if something makes logical sense. I would argue, however, that just because the existance of a God may seem illogical to you, the nonexistance of a God seems inconceivable to me. Therefore, even logic is relative to the person who is negotiating their way through it. I think that is at the heart of these discussions. We all see things, whether emotionally or logically from very different pov. Take the classic analogy of one person sitting on the north rim of the Grand Canyon and one on the South rim. Both are looking at the same canyon but if you ask them to describe it, both will have a different perception of what the Grand Canyon looks like.  You see each and ever discussion or argument about religion through a different lens than I do. Part of what makes this enjoyable to me is not attacking what others believe or see as logical but to learn from them. By contemplating what others different from I believe, think, and feel on a certain subject, I can either adjust my beliefs, disprove my beliefs, or stand a little firmer in my beliefs. No matter the outcome, I am richer for the experience. That, to me, is a major redeeming quality of such different povs. We can either isolate each other and learn nothing or we can learn from each other. I choose to learn.<br>
<br>
As far as being seekers of truth, I see your distinction. However, I would argue that in seeking faith it is because I believe that there is an underlying truth to what I believe in. I believe that my church is true, that there is truth to the doctrine taugh within it. I believe in Jesus Christ which is why I have faith in him. If I didn't think that there was truth to there being a Messiah, I would have no faith in it. Does that make sense? Just a quick example... our finances are a mess (long story short!) and we don't make enough to pay our bills with our income. However, we still pay 10% of our income to our church at tithing. We do this because we are told that we will be blessed if we act in faith to pay the tithes. Well, we have been short $600 on our bills now for nearly 2 yrs and yet we have never not come up with a way to pay them. Things happen so we can make extra money. If I didn't believe that the promise of tithing was true, that we would be blessed and the money would be there if we exercise faith and pay it, I wouldn't do it. I would put that money to my bills. I also believe that if I didn't pay that tithing, we wouldn't be able to make as much money. I believe that we are blessed for exercising that faith. I can't prove it. I can't disprove it. Yet, I believe it... emotion. But, my emotion is based on what I have reasoned to be truth... that God exists and that His promises are true. Does that make sense?<br>
<br>
Now I have rambled even more! btw, I just wanted to mention that I used to post on the A/A board a lot and always respected you for your intellect and your reason. I also appreciate the fact that you recognize that I am trying to be diplomatic in expressing my points without isolating or intending to anger anyone! Just wanted you to know that you have my respect!<br>

Or you could find photographs, data from the manufacturer....there would be a way to empirically prove it exists/existed as a purple car, to anyone who chose to seek the information out. The conclusion, no matter who sought it out, would be the same. <br>
<br>
Not so with faith. That's why faith, and all the different sects of it, are so varied- because it isn't an application that can be repeated with the same conclusion for everyone who approaches it.<br>
<br>
Paige is LDS. When she approached faith, and found what truly resonated with her as the truth of her life, LDS was her match. Not so with other people on this board. Is Paige wrong? Nope. Is someone else wrong for believing what they believe-no, not at all.<br>
<br>
But it's just further illustration that faith isn't the same thing as evidence, and evidence for faith is very different than the evidence in which the rest of the material world is deciphered. That's why...broken record me here....it was such a big deal when the Muslims and later the Christians (Acquinas) decreed that it was okay to separate faith from reason in order to make leaps in learning.  <br>

Wanda, I actually enjoy your sense of humor. No offense taken here!<br>
<br>
Jessica, That was exactly my point! The problem with religious debate is that there is no purple car~ thus, we can't prove or disprove as you could with an actual car accident. Even if the car left the scene, you would have paint fragments, etc. that could prove that the car was not red. With faith, we can't go to a car and check the color. I believe that there are &quot;paint fragments&quot; that illustrate the existance of a God but those same things I attribute to be beautiful gifts from God, someone else may attribute to science, nature, etc. I see the perpetuation of life as a gift of God. Others see it as a wonderful result of evolution and our bodies which are complex creatures. I too believe we are complex creatures but that the complexity was created by God, not the result of millions of years of a single cell mutating and changing which all these years later is me!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> dag</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(1/3/03 2:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  i cannot prove a negative</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt; I cannot prove a negative... &gt;&gt;<br>

For example, heart rate, respiratory function, brain wave activity, growth, chemical activity, etc.  These are all things that can be ascertained by independent and reproducible measurement.  This however is verifying or falsifying a positive assertion.  <br>
<br>
- You are dead.<br>
- No I'm not, I have a pulse, I am thinking, breathing and getting fatter just sitting here.<br>
<br>
- She is pregnant.<br>
- No, she's not, her hormone levels are too low, there is no fertilized ovum anywhere, and she hasn't had conjugal relations with a fertile male in the past 6 menstrual cycles.<br>
<br>
This is disproving a positive assertion.  Very different from proving a negative.  In order to prove there was no type X thing, you would have to know, absolutely, all things in existence to prove one of them wasn't the type X one.  This is why I can <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NOT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> prove there is NO god, but precisely why we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>CAN</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> prove it isn't the god xians claim it to be.  They make a positive assertion &quot;The bibble is infallible.&quot;  We refute it &quot;The bibble is wrong here, here, here and here.&quot;  The crucial factor being standards of measure and reproducible results.  I don't have to see an atom to know it is there, we can test for it reproducibly using qualities that substantiate or disprove it's existence.  <br>
<br>
Prove I am not saved.  I have beautiful kids, an amazing wife, great health, well paying job, wonderful opportunities, healthy mental attitude, positive outlook and too many other good fortunes to list. &quot;You don’t accept JC as you savior = not saved!&quot;  In walks a different sect.  &quot;Sure he is, leads a good life, tithes, etc = saved.&quot;  Argument ensues, xian beats up other xian and nothing results.  No testable, independently verifiable, reproducible quantity to use as a standard. <br>
<br>
Also, I am not explaining this because I didn't think you got it DAG, but I am sure someone didn't and this may help them understand.<br>

<br>
i'd also like to get your take on where morals come from?  are they defined by the majority living or something higher than us all.<br>
<br>
i like to refer to it as celestial law but doesn't slavery just feel wrong to you?<br>
<br>
even when the majority of this country tried to rationalize it as okay celestial law (and the constitution predicated upon celestial law) defined it as wrong.<br>
<br>
not trying to set you up or anything just looking for what defines your own personal morals. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bonbon2d>bonbon2D</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Apologist in Training</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/3/03 3:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.iambornagainru.org/bab/Avatars/cm09.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: i cannot prove a negative</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
