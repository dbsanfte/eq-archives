Sorry if I offended you, that wasn't my intention.  It's just that I hear the same thing over and over again (as I'm sure you do too), it loses it's impact.

You have sources that say one thing, I can find plenty that will say the opposite.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The reason Israel can't rely on others as a safeguard is because they have all failed the trust test. Israel has discovered that they can only rely on themselves, and then just hope that others can come to back them up.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hmm.. the examples you've cited are pretty far back there time-wise.  I understand they probably still feel the pinch, but I think somewhere along the line somebody is going to have to take a chance.  The Israelis want the Palestinians to back off and trust that they will grant them statehood, etc.  Why should they trust them?  It goes both ways.  <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>However oppression will be the end result when someone is put into a position to possibly defend themselves.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
And armed defiance will result if someone is put into a desparate situation.  The whole thing is a Catch 22, and it's been left to simmer for so long, even if they are able, by some miracle, to come to some kind of agreement, how can either side possibly completely regulate their own people?  The ill-will is so inbred, I don't know how it's going to work out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The people who are the most outspoken against the police are the ones who are always getting into trouble with them. Usually the response to these people by the public is &quot;stop breaking the law&quot;.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't think that's true.  If the situation in the neighborhood continues to escalate and require so much additional police work, isn't the natural course of action to see what is causing the increase?  What is pushing these people to increase crime?  Are they inherently criminals, or are there circumstances behind the scenes that are causing this?  If we play out this scenario in the US, the most successful programs for dealing with high-crime areas is multifaceted.  It may start with an increased police presence, but no one expects that to solve the problem, just keep a lid on it.  Meanwhile everyone works on dealing with the problems underneath.  This is what I feel Israel should be doing, but instead they continue to act as the policeman and try to crush any outbursts, instead of trying to fix the root cause.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Israel has already proved that when terrorism lessens, then so does their presence.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think it's bound to be short-lived.  Back again to the whole -- &quot;If they'll just pull out/if they'll just stop terrorism&quot; -- I don't think it's so simple.  Palestinians may say all they want is for the Israelis to pull out and everything will be great.. but honestly, look at the Palestinian Authority.. I mean, really, here's a dictatorship waiting to happen.  <br>
<br>

<br>
It's not only Arab countries that mistreat their people.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyone who handles something vastly inappropriately is criticized. Russia was criticized for how it handled that whole Chechyn-hostage situation in the theater.

<br>
People will be criticized whether they handle something inappropriately or not.  Russia was criticized because they went in and killed the very people they were supposed to save.  It also isn't necessarily the Israelis that compare themself to 9/11.  9/11 just gave people a wake up call and made them realize what Israel goes through on a regular basis.  You might not think it is comparable, but living in fear of terrorists is something that both countries experienced, but our's was a one day event, and their's is something they live with on a regular basis.  So I guess in a sense it isn't comparable, Israel's situation puts 9/11 to shame.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You were the one implying that Arab Israelis have just as great a life as Israeli Jews. I was just pointing out that this isn't the case&quot;<br>
<br>
I believe they still have just as good a life, and the ones who don't have that potential.  People outside this country can say that African-Americans don't have as good of a life in this country as the whites, and we know that in some cases this is true, but many African-Americans do live as good as the whites, and there is at least hope for those who don't because people in this country have the freedom to change things. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry if I offended you, that wasn't my intention. It's just that I hear the same thing over and over again (as I'm sure you do too), it loses it's impact. As I mentioned, I've read so many different prespectives on who owns what over there, and at this point I think it's lost its original importance. You have sources that say one thing, I can find plenty that will say the opposite&quot;<br>
<br>
No need to apologize.  I just wanted to make sure this wasn't getting personal.  I hope you know that when I debate you on this issue, I'm not feeling any hostility, and I do respect your POV eventhough I don't always agree with it.  As for the &quot;who was here first&quot; issue, this argument is constantly being used to try and push Israel out of existence, so this is why I feel the info is valid everytime.  I know that you and I get our info from different places, but people make it sound like an evil Israeli army formed miraculously out of mid-air, and then they went in and overturned some sort of government and knocked people out of their homes.  It is this myth that I'm trying to combat.  There is no doubt who this American soil originally belonged to, but if Native Americans started blowing up our kids because of it, then we still wouldn't sit by and put up with it.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm.. the examples you've cited are pretty far back there time-wise. I understand they probably still feel the pinch, but I think somewhere along the line somebody is going to have to take a chance. The Israelis want the Palestinians to back off and trust that they will grant them statehood, etc. Why should they trust them? It goes both ways.&quot;<br>
<br>
These examples aren't all that far back.  And take a chance?  We are talking about millions of lives at stake here.  Israel shouldn't have to take a chance that other countries are going to hold true to their word.  Countries breaking promises or treaties isn't anything new.  This is why all countries should have the right to defend themselves, including Israel.  Their sovereignty and the lives of all their citizens would rest on this &quot;chance&quot;, and it isn't really fair to expect this from them.  Besides, if the powerful countries have bigger fish to fry at the time, then why would they step in and intervene with Israel's newly elected dictator?  It wouldn't be at the top of anyone's priority list.  Right now the Kurds are relying on outside parties to protect them from their dictator, and these outside parties are being told that they have no business being there.  <br>
<br>
 &quot;If the situation in the neighborhood continues to escalate and require so much additional police work, isn't the natural course of action to see what is causing the increase?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure, but do they just sit by and let violence continue to escalate while they are searching for their root cause?  Besides, at what point do people become responsible for their own actions and stop trying to blame others?  I have complaints about laws and governments all the time, but I don't go blowing people up and hoping that someone will come in and make my life better in order for these things to stop.  Unless you are dealing with someone with complete psychosis, every action has an initial cause.  The 9/11 terrorists had a reason for their actions.  A lot of murderers sitting on death row had reasons for their actions.   Should we let these people out of jail while we discover what went wrong?  The reason terrorism is continuing is because they are seeing action.  If everyone lifts them up and provides excuses for the behavior while giving them everything they want in the end, then terrorism will be seen as an effective measure to get whatever you want.  African-Americans in this country had a very valid excuse for terrorism at one point, but they didn't resort to it.  Nobody can argue over whether they were oppressed because we know it is true.  Yet they still didn't resort to that sort of behavior.  People like Martin Luther King chose the peaceful solution route, and the situation gradually started to improve.  Americans didn't choose the peaceful solution to break from British rule, but they at least organized and fought the British armed forces with honor and dignity.  They didn't hop a boat to England and start shooting children in their sleep.  The excuses were there, just not the actions in question.<br>
<br>
&quot;.. but honestly, look at the Palestinian Authority.. I mean, really, here's a dictatorship waiting to happen&quot;<br>
<br>
I am in total agreement with you on this one.  This is why America is trying to push a democracy in the new state, and everyone is getting angry with us for doing so.  I'm not so much concerned about Israel if the PA becomes a dictatorship, I am concerned about the Palestinians, especially the women and Christians.<br>
<br>
&quot;We just got this month's issue of the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs.. it's always a real downer&quot;<br>
<br>
You are describing what it is like for me to read the Jerusalem Post, lol.  I haven't even been keeping up very well lately because workwise with tax season and my recent family tragedy, I need a little break from the bad news.  Don't feel bad for feeling pessimistic about all this.  I feel the same way sometimes.  I keep trying to look for good news here and there, but that stuff just doesn't sell.  There is a nasty cycle over there, and it seems like it would take a miracle to break it.  I think there are quite a few aspects of this whole situation that you and I actually do agree on.  I also think that you and I do a great job of hijacking other people's threads, lol.  <br>
