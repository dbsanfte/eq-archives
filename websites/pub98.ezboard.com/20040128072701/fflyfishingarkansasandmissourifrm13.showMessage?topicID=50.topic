Some of them might seem obvious but you might have some additional thoughts to add. I know some of these I have &quot;no idea&quot; as to how to answer the question and can see that I'm going to have to hit the books. What did I expect..... <br>
<br>
Ok, the first 10 out of 103...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">1. What are the reasons for learning the double haul?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The double haul adds feel and line speed to the cast and smooths out the stops. On short distances the line hand works making short cast much more effecient. Long days of casting can be physically less demanding. Having your line hand already involved n the stroke allows you to shoot line and have better line management. You can have much better control on under powering and over powering casts. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">2. Explain the most important factor for casting accuracy!</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Tracking.... Having your back cast being in 180 degrees from your forward cast prior to starting the forward cast puts the fly online. From there it is just getting the distance correct. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">3. How do you combine casts for getting a longer drag-free float?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> You can add or subtract additional power from a cast. You can change the plane in which a cast is delivered. Finally you can control the line as it is being shot. An example of these would be to set up a cast with a &quot;bloody L&quot; to the left, underpower the cast so that it lands with the L facing dead down stream, add a reach cast back to the left, then throw an aireal mend prior to the line hitting the water. The 70 foot cast would land in a huge Z shape. You can in theory throw casts that would never require a mend. However, they would have so much slack it would be difficult to stay in contact with a fly.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">4. When do you use the reach-cast and when the bow-cast?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> A reach cast makes an effective river mend for current coming across you. It makes a drift effective as soon as the fly hits the water. A &quot;bow cast&quot; (if it's the same cast as the bow and arrow here) is used in tight quarters and dosen't require a back cast. If they mean a curve cast it is used for throwing in a longer mend than a reach cast. A fly will have a tendancy to face down stream in a curve cast which makes it sink much quicker prior to the drift. I think they may call a curve cast a bow cast in Europe.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">5. What is the result of a high rod stop on the back cast?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> A high rod stop makes the rod plane down in front which makes the leader turn over better. <br>
<br>
6. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">What is the result of a straight line movement of your rod tip during the power stroke?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It lessens the likelyhood of tailing or open loops providing the stop is correct.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">7. What is the most important factor in distance casting?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The &quot;most&quot;...geesh.... a good back cast. A good distance cast requires, tracking SLP, proper and long acceleration of the fly ine, line speed, a good stop, overhang, and proper cast plane. Without any of those and it won't be a distance cast.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">8. What is the best term to describe the most important part of casting?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This question is a little ambigious but that being said SLP... Straight line path of the rod tip during the application of power.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">9. Describe the line angle when casting 20 feet or less!</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The backcast should be very high and the forward cast should be directed at the target.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">10. Why do you make a positive stop at the end of the back and end of the forward cast?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
The stop is what forms the loop. Without a stop the energy is not properly released and will not carry an efficient loop. The stop is &quot;needed&quot; to direct the energy in &quot;one&quot; direction.<br>
<br>

<br>
Thanks for the additional comments. That really helps out!<br>
<br>
I really like your comment on #1. I might steal that in my next class.<br>
<br>
On #2 maybe I should have said SLP since that some what &quot;implies&quot; tracking as well. While we were casting for accuracy in the OLN games I had a cross wind on my right shoulder. I was REALLY struggeling on the 70 foot target where I was nailing in on the previous day. I had plenty of distance but the loops were rolling over to the right if I didn't hit my back cast accurately. Plus I was having to shoot about 10 feet of line because I was having difficulty in carrying more than about 60 feet with perfect loops in the wind. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tracking and SLP are really two totally different things.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> But I'm not sure you can have one without the other.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I understand what you mean on #7. Can you explain that in more detail?<br>

Fly fishing is the sport of sharing! Look at it this way, if you teach me something or give me a new perspective on a casting technique and I inturn use that in a presentation or pass it on, you have a positive effect on my students. On this board/postings, that is exactly what I am trying to do, share techniques and knowledge and become a better instructor and help other to become better instructors. Ref: #7, I think that this question simply revolves around the short cast/short stroke-long cast/long stroke theory and even though we know that all of the elements you mentioned must be present or somewhat technically correct, I was thinking that without a casting stroke of the proper length I could never make a distance cast! I know you have witnessed caster that made a back cast that could have been better, or a haul that could have been better, etc. but without a casting stroke of the proper length it will not go as far as desired. Again, many elements go into this to really cast for distance, but within the mind set of the question, I think the answer is a simple one. Sometimes the board(BOG-testing) asks these question to see how complex we can make a simple answer and how much they can get us to say when we need to say only a little. They can always ask us to expand our answer but they never tell us to shut up!

<br>
That is sort of what I was wondering about a complex answer for a simple question. I'm starting to think that stroke length is a function of &quot;style&quot; not totally one of function these days though. Guys like Steve Rajeff have some of the shortest strokes out there. Bill Gammel casts with a very similar stroke. Andrew's stroke is probably 50% longer for close to the same line speed. <br>
<br>
The real difference in Rajeff's cast is his stop. It has to be the most &quot;abrupt&quot; stop of anyone I've seen. It has no bounce, no recoil, no vibration, nothing, just stillness. If I could morph Drew's stroke length, Gammel's back cast, and Rajeff's stop, the fly line would probably go into lower earth orbit.<br>
<br>
That is a tough question for me to keep simple. Sort of like &quot;What is the best fly?&quot;<br>

Think of being before the BOG's(maybe Tim Rajeff and Joan Wulff) and answering this question. They will not expect you to talk about Steve's short stroke but rather the average beginning student and instructing him about distance. I feel the same as you do about this question, it needs a thorough explanation, not just one element to key on!!!! A note about casters with shorter casting strokes attaining great distances - *any and all of these people are great technical casters, they do everything correctly and MOST efficiently, therefore, they can get away with a shorter stroke than someone that is just learning. What would Bill Gammel (or Chuck E.)teach a student about the approriate use of casting stroke length vs distance????? The separation of substance and style!! We must teach substance to students until they develope skills and style. The deeper we dig into these subjects the more we learn, I love it!

<br>
I read the articles from rajeffsports.com.  One thing I found interesting is that Tim talked about buying a fly rod to match your body type.  I have only taken one fly casting lesson in my 6 years of fly fishing.  Most of my casting has been self taught with some class work and through reading on the subject.  After reading Tim's article I am a little concerned that I may have the wrong type of rod.  I have two rods and they are both stiff, fast action rods.  My body type is rather slim, I am 5' 9&quot; and about 165 pounds, obviously not an explosive power type build.  I thought I had read somewhere that fast action rods are easier to cast, this is my reason for always buying fast action rods.  They require less work physically to load since they are so stiff.  If I read Tim's article correctly what I read is incorrect.  What I got out of his article is that fast actions rods are harder, physically to cast.  This might explain why my arm gets fatigued after a few hours of fishing.  I also have a problem with tailing loops after this fatigue kicks in.  Obviously you can't tell me exactly what is going on in my cast with out seeing it but is it possible that my arm fatigue is caused by the wrong rod type?<br>

<br>
I'd be more likely to bet that your elbow is away from your body than you have the wrong type of rod. <br>
<br>
While I agree that some rods perform better with different &quot;styles&quot; of casting stroke, there is not a rod made that I can't throw a tailing loop with. It would have to be fairly excessive for it to cause a tremendous amount of fatigue. If you spend 8 hours casting an 8 weight it is peobably not the action of the rod that makes your arm tired.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

         (B) Increases the line speed.<br>
         (C) Does not load the rod doing so (B)<br>
         (D) Controls the power of the cast.<br>
         (E) Shares the work of the cast between the rod hand and line hand.<br>
<br>
Question #2 backcast 180 from the target. With elevation, windage and a straight line path of the tip.<br>
<br>
Question #3 Combining cast to insure a longer drag free drift. Might be<br>
        A) An over head and reach cast up stream<br>
        B) Hook cast down stream and aerial mend up.  <br>
        C) Dump cast with a slack line cast.<br>
<br>
 Compound casting is using the cast and slack line control to and place the slack up stream. The fly where needed.<br>
<br>
Question #4 Bow and Reach cast are use to place the slack down or up current. The Bow cast will set the slack down stream from the wet fly to allow for the current to drag the fly across in front of the fish's lay.<br>
 The Reach cast places the slack up stream to let the Dry fly dead drift with out the pull of the line.<br>
<br>
Question #5 High stop on the back cast makes a high back cast. This might be to clear the brush or to cast closer to yourself on the front cast.<br>
<br>
Question #6 The straight line of the rod tip ensures a cast that maintains the top leg and bottom leg are parallel and the end of the line does not cross the bottom. That the loop is as small as possible.<br>
 <br>
Question #7 The most Important Factors in a long distance cast is the Acceleration of the rod to the maximum load, before the positive Stop.<br>
<br>
Question #8  The most important part of casting is the even Acceleration of the rod. <br>
<br>
Question #9 High back low front plane.<br>
<br>
Question #10  Stops, front and back, are requirements of fly casting were you are transferring energy from the loaded rod to the weighted line. The more positive the stop the more energy is focused into forming the loop.<br>

Al on question #1 you made a comment about the haul not loading the rod. I agree that it does not load the rod much if any if it is properly executed. Since you opened that can-o-worms can I get you to comment on it further?<br>

Do some research in BOG's Publications and you will see that they say hauling increases rod loading!!! I never make a post here without being able to go to 1 or more BOG's publications to back it up. In studying for the Master's, we should all be doing this as Chuck suggested. We should be teaching this to our students. If you stood before BOG Joan or Jason and told them that hauling does not increase rod loading, &quot;You Fail&quot;. Having said that, I need to say that the most effective haul comes during the Loop formation Phase of the cast (increasing line speed and line energy not rod loading) and at this point if our timing of SU&amp;S and Haul is not synchronized(quantity &amp; duration), we further load(pull down) the tip and open the loop. Also, 90% of rod loading comes from rod acceleration, the increase in rod loading from hauling would depend on the haul and it would be small but a definite increase! Think about using a haul to help pick line off of the water, as we lift/pull/accelerate the rod loads deeper and in the initial part of the casting stroke long before it has accelerated very much!  In my teachings I demonstrate to students that a haul increases line speed(primary purpose) by having a length of line laying dead on the ground and then make a haul, it moves and accelerates, then I show them how it further loads a rod by having someone hold the end of the line with a bow in the rod and I haul and the rod bows further. These demos make it perfectly clear to them. This immediately gets them to the Understanding Phase and soon they reach the Application Phase as mentioned in the MOI Course.

<br>
Actually I didn't know the BOG's ahd written on it previously. I've just had some fairly deep discussions about how the haul loads or fails to load the rod. However, I caution on taking some of the previous writings as gospel. There are &quot;some&quot; writings out there that have considerable conflict in what they state with each other.<br>
<br>
Mike, how do they describe the haul? I am thinking that the haul only puts about 5% of it's energy into actually bending the rod. The rest slides the line through the guides. We didn't talk about it previously but since we are here I also believe that the haul continues for quite a distance past the &quot;stop&quot;. Any other thoughts?<br>

I like to think of this as &quot;Old School/New School&quot; if you will. I have recently re-read Jason's chapter on the 3 phases of the cast and hauling, etc. It is fascinating and so informative for me to read with an open mind and reinforce or change my beliefs about topics that I teach and respond to here. My interest in helping you toward your Master's' cert is what has prompted me to respond to this board. I again suggest that you dig into &quot;The Nature of Fly Casting&quot; &amp;/or other pubs prior to responding. This has been most beneficial to me and I am shoring up my knowledge and perspectives for the Masters cert at the same time! I have to teach a refresher class for our club members returning to the Saltwater environment of Florida from up North tomorrow and have come up with a revised lesson plan/instructors guide using some of Jasons' writings. I think that if I can teach, Joan's way, Jason's way, Lefty's way, Mel's way, etc., that it increases my overall knowledge and understanding of the materials. You know I am already strong on the Instruction side, if I can easily perform all of the required casts and have a multi-faceted base of knowledge, I should be able to pass!

 You are refering to <br>
(B) Increases the line speed.<br>
(C) Does not load the rod doing so (B)<br>
<br>
IF you are hauling you are increasing the line speed. This is what makes the loop, (Line speed is faster than what is pulling it.) IF you increase the speed of the line you have more energy flowing in the line/loop.<br>
IF you get your haul too hard or soon then the rod is forced to bend more.This robs the speed of the line. Yes some of the energy in moved to the rod. This can be bad too. SLP lost.<br>
 So what we want is to speed up the line let the rod maintain it's straight line path then Release the rod energy to thrust the tip FASTER Draging the line. As the haul has just added 3 or 4 times the line speed. Now the line is traveling faster than the rod tip. LOOK a LOOP. If we can make the rod stop from very fast to a rock solid no movement the line will have absorbed all the energy that was 'pulled' into the line by the rod and the haul. Mass X Speed.<br>
 So that the loading of the rod by the haul is a miss nomer in my way of thinking.  <br>
  Try hauling with just your hand. You did not load your hand did you?? you still got the loop to form and fly somewhere.<br>
 If you do this put on a glove the line burns.<br>
