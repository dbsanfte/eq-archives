The topic in general didn't really get much response so I thought I'd post the topic here and see if all of you would throw in your two cents worth. Here are a few of the tips that I think are relatively important.<br>
<br>
1. The back cast in opposition to the forward cast.<br>
2. Proper tracking.<br>
3. The tip path should be high in the back and low in the front such that the leader turns over precisely on the target.<br>
4. Excessive energy all the way to the target.<br>
5. Imagine a very small target and aim for it.<br>
6. Cast off your dominate eye.<br>
7. Use a very compact casting stroke with as little movement as feasible for the amount of line you are casting.<br>
8. Dominate foot forward. If you are a right handed caster cast with your right foot forward. This is exactly opposite of a distance cast.<br>
9. Take the fly line past your ear or over your head. It should not be out to your side or off your body. It's like shooting a basketball not like swinging a tennis recket.<br>
10. Use equipment that is up to the task. Long tapered fly lines, stiff leaders, and fast actioned fly rods are the ticket. Use a fly line that carries enough energy to the tip. Don't get caught up in a delicate presentation.<br>
11. Make your stops short of the target. When you finally &quot;release&quot; your cast and lay your rod down it will go roughly 18&quot; farther than your false cast.<br>
12. A soft grip with lazer sharp stops.<br>
13. Pay attention to what your loops are doing while fasle casting and make corrections accordingly. If your loops are turning off to the side you have a tracking issue to the side the L forms on. Make your back cast corrections to that side before releasing the cast.<br>
14. Practice, practice, practice........<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are about 20 others that we will think of in the days to come. These are just the ones that came to mind off the top of my head.<br>

3. The tip path should be high in the back and low in the front such that the leader turns over precisely on the target.<br>
I would consider this the most important tip.  When going for accuracy the fly should never unfold above the target.  It does not take much of a breeze to move the fly off target.  You should what I call powering the fly to the target with tight loops as if you are trying to destroy the target.<br>
<br>
10. Use equipment that is up to the task. Long tapered fly lines, stiff leaders, and fast action fly rods are the ticket. Use a fly line that carries enough energy to the tip. Don't get caught up in a delicate presentation.<br>
<br>
I personally prefer a moderately fast rod but a fast rod might be better for a target that is 65-75 out. You are right on the short stiff leaders you don't want to be trying to use 12 ft. 4X leader.<br>

<br>
Accuracy casting is something done more with the dominate eye than anything else. About the closest comparison I can make is the difference between throwing a baseball vs throwing a dart. Casting &quot;off shoulder&quot; violates so many of the principles of good form in accuracy casting that it is a very difficult skill to master.<br>

Add two more tweaks to your list:<br>
<br>
15 - Short, fast rods tend to be more accurate than long rods (even long, fast rods) - rod tip is closer to your hand and maybe a hand-eye coordination thing?<br>
<br>
16 - Everyone should read Joan Wolff's &quot;Fly Casting Accuracy&quot; - I think that is the title, or something close to it.  I'm guilty of not reading the entire book and of not practicing anywhere near enough - hmm, maybe that should be a New Year&quot;s resolution?  By the way, if I remember right this book has a pretty good section on &quot;off-arm&quot; casting - for you right handed folks that's casting with your right hand over your left shoulder, vice versa for lefties.<br>

<br>
Very good points.  BTW, I didn't think much of the dominate side foot being ahead when you first mentioned it some time ago.  But the best analogy would be free throw shooting.  I was taught to find the nail on the free throw line (yes, there always is one right in the middle) and put your right foot there if you are right handed.  Free throws are much like accuracy casting or dart throwing.  You put yourself in the exact same position and &quot;shoot&quot; in the exact same manner at the exact same distance.  The &quot;ball&quot; is shot off the dominate side eye.  As in free throws the distance is a given even though in casting there are several given distances.  I'm thinking here of the CCI exam.  But it is something you can practice.  <br>
<br>
That's why you see seventy year old guys who can literally make hundreds of free throws in a row.  Hell, I haven't picked up a ball in years but I KNOW I could make at least 5 out of 10 right now just because I know HOW to do it.  (And it goes all over me when college players can't make 7 or 8 out of 10 because it means they are poorly coached or haven't invested the time in practice.)<br>
<br>
Anyway, when I was taking the exam, I told myself that nothing was different about this set up than the one I had in the yard at home.  It was just like shooting free throws.  Forty five feet was forty five feet.  The variable was wind and we have plenty of that out here on the plains so I was right at home. :^)<br>

<br>
I made a huge error and please forgive me. When I looked back through my notes I left out one of the most important things, casting in the wind for accuracy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The back cast has to be 180 degrees from the forward cast.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Sounds easy enough. The back cast being out of plane with the forward cast causes the leader to turn over to the side. It throws a funky twist at the end of the cast as the leader turns over. At least it is a slight horizontal tailing loop. At worst it throws a huge bloody &quot;L&quot; in your cast.<br>
<br>
A simple way of thinking about it is that if you were going to throw forward to a target in front of you, you would lead slightly to allow for the wind. You have to do the same thing with your back cast. Allow for some lead with the wind in your back cast. You will need to make several false casts until you feel that you have it &quot;dialed in&quot;. Then you can simply let it go.<br>
<br>
If you are making good loops there is not reason you can't hit anything within a distance of the amount of line you can comfortably carry.<br>

The finest casters in the world have the most and best control of the tip. Of course, to control the tip, you must first have master control of the entire lower part of the rod. Once you do have that ultimate tip control, you can do everything else that's been said.<br>

It can tell you an aweful lot.  Most importantly you want the top portion of the loop to track directly over the bottom.  If you are off even the slightest bit it will show.  I prefer a vertical Joan Wulff type approach.  I now know whether I am going to hit the target not by where I am pointing to but by whether or not I stayed in the same plane on both back and forward casts.  I see this through my line as in un-roles in front of me.<br>
<br>
Limiting body motion and focusing on only the essential movements is critical.<br>
<br>
I spent this past summer practicing 5-6 times a week in my yard in the dark.  I waited for my boy to go to bed and then started casting.  I'd turn on the halogen work lamps and cast to a hat.  Over the summer I dialed in my casting significantly.  Practicing in a non-fishy environment can be a good thing, you don't focus on the fish.<br>
<br>
Good luck,<br>

Individually I was at 2500 on the targets plus Distance role at 70+ and a distance cast of 97 +/-.  It is harder to remember since it is a little ways ago.   I believe this is how it broke down.  The outer ring is six feet, than four feet and finally the inner ring is two feet in diameter.  You know that though, oh well.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

at 25 feet - 800 (300, 300, 200)<br>
at 50 feet - 700 (200, 200, 300)<br>
at 70 feet - 600 (300, 0, 300) <br>

600 - 50 feet -(100,200,300)<br>
600 - 70 feet (300, 0, 300)<br>
500 - and the curve - (100,200,200)<br>

Now that makes 2500.  <br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I remember meeting you at the OLN Masters at the Paradise Lodge in PA. Do you remember me?  I was George Daniel’s casting coach.   I was hoping to talk to you for a few minutes after the casting contests were over to get some casting tips from you.   That has been the only time that I have attended one of these competitions.  I remember that the tension in the air was as thick as pea soup.  Is this level of tension always present in these competitions?  <br>
<br>

<br>
I remember meeting you.  I wish I had been able to spend time with you.  I am always looking for ways to improve my casting.  George has a georgeous cast.<br>
<br>
In regards to the stress, it was present in all the competitions I have been a part of at some level.  For me individually the OLN qualifier was the worst.  It was all or nothing and I had no idea of how I would stack up against the competition at the time.  I was pleasantly surprised at its outcome.  It is nice to know that all the practice did pay off!<br>
<br>
The least stressful for me was the OLN finals.  For three reasons: The first is that we had made it.  The second is that I had seen myself on television previously and was not impressed with where I was personally and how I managed the stress.  Which leads into the third, I told myself that regardless of what happened I would have a great time out there and I did!!  <br>
<br>
For anyone who is competitive the stress, anxiety, nerves, competitive drive and or desire will inevitably show themselves at some point.  At least that is what I have seen in myself and the others I was competing against.  <br>
<br>
Hopefully we can catch up at some point in the future.  If you see George at all please tell him I said hello.<br>
<br>
Regards<br>
<br>

The air was thick, to say the least, and one of the &quot;golden boys&quot; who shall remain nameless, blew his distance big time, and looked at his rod and line as though they were at fault. <br>
 I got hit with a case of &quot;aaaaack&quot; when I stepped up for the distance, and the result was shortening my distance by 15 feet. It surprised me, because I felt pretty ready,maybe John watching made me hyper aware of the need to get a good score (not that my distance was even that good to start with) But for the accuracy, I was remarkabley focused and calm.I didn't get anywhere near the scores the top 12 got, but at least hit one ring at the 70 foot target, which for me, was a coup. As I was false casting one of my buddies yelled &quot;Nail it, Red!&quot; and the judge in the canoe chose that moment to almost tip the canoe.....I had all the line in the air that I could carry, and a miracle happened when I let loose.  Sometimes pressure is a GOOD thing!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=57.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=57.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=57.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.threadControl?topicID=57.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=57.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=57.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm5">Help Files<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm6">Archives<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm8">White River<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm9">Taneycomo<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm10">Little Red<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm11">Norfork<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm12">Places of Interest<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13">Casting Corner<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14">General Discussions<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm17">The Environment<option value="flyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm18">Fly Tying and Entomology</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri>Fly Fishing Arkansas and Missouri</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13>Casting Corner</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><a href="http://www.flyfishingarkansas.com">Fly Fishing Arkansas</a><font color=#000000> - </font><br><br> <a href="http://www.flyfishingarkansas.com">BACK TO FLY FISHING ARKANSAS HOME PAGE</a>
