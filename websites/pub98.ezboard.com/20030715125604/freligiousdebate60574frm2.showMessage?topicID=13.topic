<br>
I think when we are born there is a 'life force' - call it chi, a soul, consciousness - that exists separately but intrinsicly a part of us.  It is this that makes us, well... 'us'.  Do I think that this is g-dgiven - no.  Do I think that even a cloned child can have one - yes.<br>
<br>
When artificial insemination was a new and burgeoning science the same questions were there, and decades later we see that it was just silly.<br>
<br>
I have reservations about the cloning process, and I think this group, if they have succeeded, has just put a major roadblock in the research into therapeutic cloning.  Because of their beliefs (that is a whole other subject), and that cloning is a major part of it, the backlash will outlaw all types of cloning.<br>

It will happen because it can and I just wish we had more public debate about how it will/should/could be. All these attempts to stop or ignore it in this country are thwarting any effort to get a grasp on what this means and start to develop dialoge for guidelines, national and international laws for cloning and the clones themselves, ethical standards and practices etc. and I would imagine the discussion of whether or not clones have a soul would be a very large part of that.<br>
<br>
I don't personally believe we have souls either and I don't think it matters. If parts of tissue are cloned (like a nose or ear) that should be separate from the cloning of a baby. A cloned baby would have the same rights any of us do and it's own personality and identity. I think too many of the opponents of this are hung up on a &quot;Boys From Brazil&quot; scenario. <br>
<br>
I would be very interested though in the perspective of religious folks. One would think a cloned baby would get a soul just like any new little fetus from the whatever deity oversees this--or if not would we have some sort of freakish zombie like pod people roaming around? <br>
<br>
I have a hypothetical too. For anyone who asserts cloned babies have no souls, would abortion then be acceptable for this mother? Would she still be committing murder if the baby were a clone?<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Like I said too--would these same folks be okay with aborting cloned fetuses or are they willing to make them second class citizens??? Weird.

I actually was thinking about that last night.  This really will provide a fascinating twist to that debate - unlike identical twins who generally are raised in the same environment, clones would be raised in completely different situations.<br>
<br>
And Mama G, you're right.  Misunderstanding is the root of a lot of the misinformation put forth by people, and I think many of them are not separating their personal beliefs from the issue.  Christopher Reeve had it right on Donahue the other night - religion has no place in this debate.<br>
<br>
He too brought up the issue that if he went to another country to have any form of treatment, under the law that is coming before the senate, he could be arrested and put in jail upon his arrival back in the United States.<br>

OK, I'll bite as a religious person (though some we know would debate that label <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  Yes, I believe a cloned person would have a soul.  Why?  Because a person is a person, no matter how he or she got here.  Of course, I also like to believe my cat has a soul.<br>
<br>
I do have a problem with cloning--I don't think we should do something just because it's scientifically possible.  I have no issue with anything that truly improves lives, I just don't see this as one of them.  Plus, it weirds me out.  Who knows if this latest claim is real--but if it's not, I feel it's only a matter of time.<br>
<br>
My main issue right now is that cloning is not a perfected procedure and I don't like the idea of experimenting on humans.  I've read articles about the high number cloning disasters on mammals--freakish things that I can't believe someone would risk inflicting on their child.  There are other ways to have children, if you so desire.<br>
<br>
So, that's my .02 for what it's worth.<br>

A clone would be just like a twin of you. Now, as a twin (but only a fraternal twin) I got to know alot of other twins, a number of them identical. Even have a couple of identical twins in the family as well. These are children in the womb at the same time - can't get any more similar than that now can you? Yet when they are born, they already show different personalities. Hell, they show them in the womb as well. Of all the twins I know, I can think of only one set who were even remotely alike, and even they had their differences. <br>
<br>
As for a soul. IF (big IF) there are souls, and since I do believe there is a higher something, just not what they think of as god, then clones would have one. Why wouldn't they? I've tried to think of a reason why it wouldn't have a soul and I can't think of one. If souls are given, then surely a benevolent G-d would give this baby a soul as well. If souls split apart from the souls of those creating it, then it would have part of the soul of its mother -ok that's a little creepy. So why wouldn't it have a soul?<br>
<br>
Of course my lovely MIL is saying SOULLESS there for its one of the signs of the apopcolipse (sp). Then again, she's been shouting that one for a long time. She hasn't even started saving for retirement because she is certain the world will end before that. <br>

My biggest concern is whether the clone would be defective or not. How cruel would it be to bring something into this world only for it to die early and painfully. Haven't the majority of other cloned animals been unfit to survive in some way?<br>
<br>
I still can't figure out why wouldn't it have a soul if souls exisit? But then I don't understand how a supposidely benevolent god damns people to hell. But i suppose that is another debate altogether. <br>
<br>
But this life is an innocent life. It did not ask for it to be conceived in the manner in which it was conceived. Would this be a second sin of the father type deal (such as original sin)? But even original sin did not stop man from having souls, if that is what you believe. <br>

I think this whole thing is a hoax anyway, but it pisses me off--the vast majority of americans are now (more than ever) going to equate &quot;cloning&quot; with the &quot;manufacturing&quot; of entire human beings, rather than the valid medical benefits that cloning presents (organ transplants, skin grafting, etc). <br>

My MIL and I are having this debate at home. Well, more of series of explanations followed by random articles stuffed into my mailbox, but ANYway...<br>
<br>
A male cannot truly be cloned. He has no provision of host cells. A woman, by producing an ovum, does. There is more to a cell than just the genetic material in the nucleus, there is also all the genetic material in the extra-nucleic fluids. RNA that run the cell internally. So a macroscopic clone still isn't a clone on a microscopic level. Furthermore, we don't know how much the RNA contributes to the development of a person, Nature v. Nurture aside. So there is a whole array of possible differences between the older and younger twins/clones. Identical twins are actually mirrors of each other, reflections. The hair curls in opposite directions, that sort of thing. A clone would be truly identical in that it curled in the same direction. Does this have to do with the direction of the genetic duplication during cellular division at the time the twins egg split? We Don't Know!<br>
<br>
Does a clone have a soul? Nope. None of us do. If we had a soul that determined our personalities and dispositions, then they would not change so dramatically when we suffer head trauma or chemical imbalances. We have a complex organic structure that we operate from and shifts in it change our behaviors, with radical shifts killing us. Outlawing this will be as effective as outlawing drugs or liquor. Regulation would be better as our current level of technology is insufficient to insure the safety and health of the baby, who is the only one not involved in the choices made.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, just another choice on the menu of family planning. <br>

<br>
I guess my idea of the existance of souls is similar to a paganistic view. I believe that we most likely have some form of energy in us that has the capability of existing intradimentionally. Our solid bodies cannot, so when we die, our &quot;soul&quot; is released. At that point in time, it can choose to inhabit another newly created life or it can go from plane to plane of existance doing whatever it is that these energies do. Where my idea of souls differ from many people's view points is that the soul does not make a person. The person's brain, upbringing, etc. make who is sitting before the computer, but the soul is much more internal. I guess like a symbiotic (sp?) relationship. One cannot exist without the other, BUT a soul can carry some of the prior experiences from it's physical form (Sort of like an imprint) I really wish I could explain more of what I feel a soul is to me, but I am still forming that hypothesis. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Before you criticize someone, walk a mile in their shoes.

 <br>
From a religious stand point, I do believe there is an actual point of conception at the time of the cloning so therefore there is a soul. I say that because according to the Bible, souls are created at the time of conception. <br>
<br>
Not sure if &quot;conception&quot; is the exact word I want to use here, but what I mean is the exact point this clone became a fetus instead of just a bunch of separate cells. Make sense?<br>

And yes, its true about MIL. About 5 years ago I had finally talked her into starting her 401k at work. It took a while but she finally started it. A year ago she stopped contributing to it because FIL lost his job and they wanted the extra money. When DH asked if she had started back up again she says its a waste of time as the end of time is near. She prays daily that we (me especially - I'm former Catholic, she doesn't know that I've moved even farther away in my beliefs now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) will &quot;find&quot; God before its too late. She tells DH about the signs that the end of the world is coming. She's now trying to get the money out of the 401k because she thinks its wasted there. <br>
<br>
Yet, even believing the end of the world is here, she wants me to pump out the babies <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
