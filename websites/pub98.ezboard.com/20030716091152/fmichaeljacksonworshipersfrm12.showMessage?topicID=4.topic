Chapter 3 part 1<br>
Good Bye<br>
<br>
As Nancy left Michael’s room, Randy came up to see if Mike was okay. Nancy and Randy occasionally flirted with each other. Nancy has a thing for him. Randy is checking her out.<br>
“Hey Nance is Michael okay?” Randy asked eyeing her in her uniform.<br>
“No he is still sleeping..” Nancy said sauntering past him with a somewhat “catch me” look on her face. Randy came up behind her and pressed his hard on into her ass.<br>
Nancy gasped and led him to her room. Randy sat down on the bed, while Nancy sat in his lap.<br>
“When can we be married?” Randy asked.<br>
“When you tell your family that you are in love with me.” Nancy sat grinding her big behind into his lap. He groaned, for a minute realizing that if he were to ejaculate it would show.<br>
“Girl…don’t do that.” Randy said holding her hips.<br>
“Why not?” Nancy asked seductively kissing his lips.<br>
“Alright that’s it. I have to have you now.” Randy said undoing her uniform.<br>
“Randy!” she said trying to stop him.<br>
In two seconds flat he was in her, working it like he hasn’t had it for a while. Nancy just gave into his animalistic approach.<br>
“Randy! Oh Randy..” Nancy tried not to scream but he made her.<br>
Randy decided to make it a quickie. He gave her a few more thrusts and emptied his load into her. Nancy whimpered like a puppy, Randy collected himself and walked out the room after giving her a kiss. Nancy smiled to herself. She loves him. Michael woke up around 10:30. He smelled the breakfast on the bench, and tried to eat but after crying all night nothing felt right. He used to make breakfast for me with Nancy’s help. He would surprise me on morning when I had a bad night the night before. He is so sweet. Michael put the tray back on the bench and went into the bathroom. He showered, and dried off. When he came downstairs, Rachel was playing Jermaine’s hair and was laughing.<br>
“Michael the doctor called and they said that Nila is awake and responsive if you want to see her.” Mother said as she told Rachel to stop.<br>
“Okay, thank you Mother.” Michael said going into his office.<br>
“Are we going to see Mommy, Daddy?” Rachel asked.<br>
“I don’t know.” Michael said closing the door.<br>
Everyone looked at each other, they didn’t know what to do. Normally Michael would see anyone in the hospital, but why wouldn’t he see me? Rachel followed him and opened the door. Michael was facing the window looking at a picture of the three of us together. He didn’t want to loose me. I don’t want to loose him. Please come see me, I need you here Michael. The hospital is not all it’s cracked up to be. Rachel came around to face Michael, he was crying again. Rachel crawled into his lap and hugged him.<br>
“Don’t cry Daddy, Mommy doesn’t want you to cry. She told me in my dream.” Rachel said trying to cheer him up. Michael put the picture down, looked at his step-daughter and smiled.<br>
“I’m trying not to cry sweetie, it’s very hard right now.” Michael said taking a tissue, wiping his tears. Rachel rested her head on his chest and he rubbed her back. <br>
“I guess we can go see her today.” Michael said looking into her brown eyes, and heart shaped face. Rachel said that she was going to make a poster and joyfully ran to her room. Michael ordered flowers to be delivered to the house so he could bring them to the hospital. Michael called Seymour and they went to the hospital but, they couldn’t be prepared for what they were about to see……<br>
