She could smell the cholorine.<br>
<br>
        She walked bent down at the side and moved her fingers around in the water for a few seconds, &quot;I used to do alot of things...alot of sports and activities like that. Basketball...Soccer...Softball, they wouldn't let me play regular baseball, they said I was a girl so I needed to take it easy....&quot; she laughed and stood up and walked over to the diving board, &quot;....Track...&quot; She took a step onto the diving board, &quot;...Swimming...&quot; She took one more step towards the edge of the board, &quot;...and Diving.&quot; She dove into the pool. <br>
<br>
       Laon could see her floating gracefully under the water.<br>
As she emerged from the water Laon smiled and clapped, &quot;Nicely done&quot;<br>
<br>
      Athena laughed, &quot;Thank you...&quot; She swam over to the steps and got out, &quot;but I stopped doing all of those things...&quot;<br>
<br>
      Laon looked puzzled, &quot;I know what you're thinking Laon...why did I stop?...&quot; She took a deep breath, &quot;When my grandparents starting getting sick,...I stayed with them...all of my free time went to their care...I didn't even go to school anymore...I tried for about a month but my grades went down majorly...all I could think about was keeping those two with me as long as possible...&quot; She looked up at the lights on the ceiling, &quot;...they were all I had left...&quot;<br>
<br>
         Athena jumped back to reality and frowned when she realized how much information she had just shared with Laon. &quot;I'm sorry I bored you with that...I usually don't share information like that with people I've known for half my life...much less someone I've known for half a day.&quot; <br>
<br>
         She gave Laon an unsure smile, &quot;But you've gotta let your guard down sometimes....right?&quot; With that she pushed Laon into the pool. Laughed hysterically as he popped his head out of the water she said, &quot;Hmm...maybe I should take back that last comment...you should never take your guard down...in fact...how about we work on having yours up at all times?!?!&quot; She laughed and jumped back into the pool. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chococow>Choco Cow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/8/03 1:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: continued from daydreams&amp;nightthings</span><hr size=1> Laon was laughing on the outside, and playing with Athena, but in the inside, guilt was swirling around in him. <br>
Athena had done so much too keep her grandparents with her, even dropped out of school. But had Laon did that. Had he clung to the last thread of geaneology he had, his baby sister Celia, no. He had just let her walk off bu herself. He had no idea where she was, she could even be dead. Laon hoped he would get to see her again. He did miss his little sister terribly sometimes. He turned to Athena and grinned.&quot;You are one of the most hyper people I ever met.&quot; Athena grinned.<br>
&quot;And you are one of the nicest person I ever met.&quot; She smiled, and kissed him on the cheek, then splashed under the water.<br>

&quot;Sure, you poured your heart and soul out to me, the least I can do is give you a taste of mine. See, when I was about, 16 or so, my parents were powerful magic people, apparently, they had gotten on somebody's bad side. They were both murdered.&quot; He heard Athena take a little gasp. &quot;I had a sister, Celia, only about a year younger than me, well after everything was taken care of, we just went our seperate ways, I haven't seen her since. I just wished I had gotten her to go with me, you know, so I'd know she would be okay.&quot; He said, his voice no more than a hoarse whisper at the end. &quot;She does have the other part of this amulet, it's the last thing our parents left to us, they had recieved it as a wedding gift, and broke it in half, and gave one to each of us in the will, it's the last thing of my parents that I have.&quot;<br>
Athena looked at him sadly.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
