Finally a chance to reply! <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We are to live in a continued state of expectancy for the Lord’s coming, as an event always near.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
I understand about the Christian <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>church's</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> desire for followers to live in a &quot;continued state of expectancy&quot; but I don't get how an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>event</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> can be &quot;always near.&quot; Either it is near approaching and then it arrives, it's a long way off and eventually arrives - or it is just not approaching at all. In the case of JC, it hasn't happened in over 2000 years and in anyone's book that is not &quot;near.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Near:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 1. To, at or within a short distance or interval in space or time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How “near” did James mean? It could only be a hope, for Jesus had distinctly said that no one knew when he would return. The term “near” here means simply to bring near or to approach. No specific prediction was made, so no false prophesy<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As DBC pointed out, the problem here is biblical contradiction. James said it was near, but since it didn't happen, Christians are forced to reinterpret it to mean James <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hoped</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it was near. <br>
<br>
Mark 9.1 quotes Jesus proclaiming &quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Truly I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If that wasn't a false prophesy, I do not know what is. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The “last times” referred to here are when Christ shall come a second time to judge. This time stretches from Christ’s ascension to His coming to judgement. Again, no specific prophesy made, so no false prophecy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This time will continue to &quot;stretch&quot; as long as there are Christians around to stretch it. Saying it hasn't come YET follows the same kind of logic as &quot;you can't prove God <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>doesn't</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> exist.&quot;<br>
<br>
Edited to add: or as MightyK might say, &quot;the mystical purple carp hasn't arrived in my backyard fountain <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>yet.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The answer to this lies within this passage. Not in verse 8 as stated above, but rather in verse 9. “The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.” In other words, He’s not going to come until everyone gets the chance to repent, and not when we (or the apostles) think He should come.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The way I read this, it seems that even in biblical times they were already trying to explain away JC's failure to show. JC clearly told his followers he'd be back in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>their lifetime</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. He wasn't - so to cover for him simply blame the followers for misinterpreting what he said and being impatient. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> This is the same thing as with the reference in James…we should always be ready. How soon? Well, it's sooner than it was a minute ago! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Cute. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Soon:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 1. In the near future; shortly. 2. Without hesitation; promptly. 3. Before the usual or appointed time; early. 4. With willingness; readily. 5. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Obsolete.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Immediately.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I don't see &quot;over 2000 years from now after you're all dust&quot; anywhere on that list.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Revelation -John believes &quot;the time is at hand,&quot; and that the things that he writes about in Revelation will &quot;shortly come to pass.&quot; 1:1, 3 <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
- John here is urging his readers to be ready at all times for the Last Judgment and the establishment of God’s kingdom. We don’t know when, but we must be prepared.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
See, I think that at the time this stuff was written down, they DID think the time was literally at hand and would shortly come to pass. But after waiting around several hundred years, they were forced to change the meaning to &quot;could happen anytime, so be ready.&quot; What choice did they have -- other than to admit JC was a false prophet and abandon the religion?<br>
<br>
I will give the last word to Fundamentalist Baptist Minister and biblical scholar Clayton Sullivan (from Rescuing Jesus from the Christians, page 22):<br>
<br>
&quot;Evidence suggests Jesus also expected other dramatic events <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>to occur in the near future</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (emphasis mine). The Jewish temple in Jerusalem was to be destroyed. The sun would be darkened, the moon would no longer give its light, and stars would fall from heaven. National strife, famines, wars and earthquakes woud take place. Jesus also fortold that that a mysterious Son of Man would descend on clouds from heaven with power and glory. This Son of Man would send out angels to the sound of a heavenly trumpet, to gather the &quot;elect&quot; from the four winds and from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.  (Mark 13:2; 13:24-27; Matt 24:7)&quot;<br>
<br>
None of this happened in &quot;the near future&quot; from the time Jesus said it. It didn't even happen in the distant future from that time. But you may continue to believe it will happen &quot;soon&quot; because JC said so. That's how religion works.<br>

<br>
&quot;Kate - do Muslims have an end time/ judgement day belief?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, Judgment Day/End Times are quite central to our faith.  However, it is stated explicity in the Qur'an and in the Hadiths that people would ask Prophet Muhammad when Judgment Day would be and he always replied &quot;only God knows&quot; (paraphrasing).  There is a lot of info on &quot;Signs of the End of Time&quot;, and there are &quot;major&quot; signs and &quot;lesser&quot; signs, mostly transmitted through ahadith, but it's sketchy, and people debate as to what they really mean, are they literal or figurative, etc.  The vast majority agree that it is not really productive to get into that overly much.  It's like debating about when you're going to die, will it be tomorrow or will it be in 50 years, who knows?  And what is the point really, since you should be focusing on how you lead your life, not when it will end.. JMO<br>

<br>
I don't find it strange at all.  Many people ponder on such issues.. how did it all begin, how will it all end, what is our purpose here, etc.  I think it's pretty common, I just personally don't find it productive to dwell on the end part too much.  I mean, it's important as a Muslim to believe that there will be a Judgment Day, but it is more important to realize you could fall down and die from a heart attack in the next 5 minutes, so you should live your life with the idea that it won't last forever.  Meaning, don't spend your time living an &quot;inappropriate&quot; life counting on having enough time at the end to &quot;go straight&quot;.  We believe that once you die, you're done and just wait around until Judgment Day.. you can't better or worsen your position once you die, that's it.  So really, what we should be more concerned about is when we are going to die.. we don't believe that anything we do can accelerate or delay the coming of the Last Day, it will happen regardless, so to really try and study all the signs and try and work towards achieving them (that sounds really strange to me) or preventing them, that would be a waste of time.<br>

I do find it odd though that it wasn't until I admit I wasn't christian, nor believed in an intereactive God, that I really was exposed to the whole end times thing. I had always heard about it in vague terms, but never understood it, and it wasn't something my church and catholic school even taught. I guess Catholics have other ways of using fear to keep people in line. <br>

<br>
Do you mean, since we can't effect any change why do we need to know about it?  Once again, speaking for myself here personally, when I read the writings about the End of Time it is simply a reminder to me that all life comes to an end.. I mean, we also know that one day our sun will collapse (somebody science-minded help me out here), and I imagine there are those who are interested to learn about the stages leading up to that event.. why?  Do they hope to be able to prevent it?  I don't think so, I think it's just part of our human need to know.<br>
<br>
As far as learning about Judgment Day, I think that is different.  Learning about the End of Time, the signs leading up to that, etc., I think is done out of curiosity; but learning about the Day of Judgement, it encourages, inspires you to be prepared for it.  I've listened to various lectures on these topics in the Islamic viewpoint, and there's a difference between when they talk about End Times, and when they talk about the Day of Judgement.<br>

There are lots of things that I can't control and that don't really affect my life overmuch that I am interested in. Think about the news as an example...how many news stories really affect us? Obviously, a lot do but a lot have nothing to do with me and yet I am interested in them anyway.<br>
<br>
From my perspective too, there is a healthy level of interest and then there is I'm-so-obsessed-I-eat-sleep-and-drink-this level of interest in the endtimes, you know? I think in its healthiest sense from a Christian mindset, the endtimes can be taken as a reminder to live your life to its fullest and to the best of your ability because you might not have tomorrow. <br>
<br>
Anyway, don't know if that makes sense, but that's my take.<br>

<br>
See, when I was a practicing christian I always figured judgement day was when we died. I never thought it was a massive day of judgement for everyone. Never even realized until afterwards that this wasn't a christiandom wide belief. <br>

<br>
End of Times is just what it says, the end of time, of life, of existence in the way we perceive it.  Judgment Day comes after the End of Times, when all mankind is brought together and &quot;evaluated&quot;, for lack of a better term.  End of Times is natural progression of life towards its end, whereas Judgment Day is kind of like the pivot point between the end of this existence and the beginning of a new one.<br>
<br>
Did that make sense, lol?<br>

A lot of Christians think they have everything figured out, and if that is the case, then why go through the experiences?  We all know that the end times are going to come somehow and someway.  Humans are not going to live on this planet forever.  If there is a God, then it would make sense that he wouldn't want all the answers so cut and dry, because then people would have little reason to live.  It is like predicting a superbowl winner.  You can have a good idea of who is going to win, but you won't know for sure until the game is over.  It seems like both Judaism and Islam have some &quot;gray areas&quot;, and that helps to give people a purpose.  Jews have all sorts of different views on the afterlife and Messianic times, and rabbis think this is healthy because it means that people will take it upon themselves to live properly and work towards Tikkun Olam (reparation of the world) since nobody knows for sure what will happen.  If people sat around expecting the end, or they were so certain over whether there was an afterlife, then they would be focusing on these things instead of what is right in front of them.  I'm not sure how Islam views people of other religions, but Judaism views other religions as different paths to God, as opposed to being outright wrong.  I feel that this Christian version of end times is telling everyone &quot;we are right, and you are wrong&quot; because it is basically saying that anyone who isn't just like them will suffer here on earth while the Christians will be sitting pretty in heaven.  This just seems intolerant to me.  <br>
<br>
Now that I think back on it, one of the things that started to bug me a little about the Left Behind series is how they seemed to address Jews and Muslims.  They had the one Jewish rabbi go on tv and tell his followers that Christ is really the Messiah, and they made the Muslims out to look like terrorists.  Recall the part where the Muslims are running up yelling something about Allah while trying to kill people?  Maybe that is part of why I haven't picked up the third book yet.  I look at the whole thing as being just as fictional as any other novel, but a lot of people are reading these because they believe it.  I think they tend to play into the whole notion of the Jews being &quot;wrong&quot; and the Muslims being primitive and psycho.  Oh yeah, and let's not forget the notion of the Christians being 100% right.  It isn't so much the message in the books that bother me, but the fact that these books are reflecting what way too many truly feel.  I can't speak for Islam(Kate?LOL), but I can tell you that if Jews put out a common belief that only we were to be redeemed because everyone else is wrong, then this society would throw a shit fit.  <br>

<br>
Anyway, the biggest issue on the salvation front for Muslims is the recognition of the Oneness of God.  We believe that the only thing God will *not* forgive is if people ascribe partners to Him... but despite what some people think, we're not really big on trying to get everyone to agree with us.  One of my favorite Surah's from the Qur'an:<br>
<br>
Say: &quot;O you who disbelieve, I do not worship that which you worship, and neither do you worship that which I worship. And I will not worship that which you have worshipped, and neither will you worship that which I worship. Unto you, your religion, and unto me, mine.&quot; (109:1-6)<br>
<br>
<br>
I also agree with Stacey in what she was saying about the &quot;gray areas&quot;, and that giving you purpose.  One thing Islam really emphasizes is personal accountability.. it is not an excuse for me to say &quot;some Sheikh told me to do such-and-such,&quot; I have to research and be fully prepared to take the consequences for my actions.  There are a lot of gray areas in Islam, and we can look to scholars to help guide us, but we cannot blindly follow them.<br>

Does the Christian belief of Jesus being God fit in here?  I've heard that Muslims see this as polytheism or idolatry, is that correct?  If so, does that mean that Islam teaches that Christians will be condemned for this belief?  Just curious!<br>

Well, Muslims believe that the early Christians did not worship Jesus as Divine.  My understanding is that there are still some Christian groups that don't?  Anyway, yes that's a pretty big issue and one that is specifically addressed in the Qur'an several times as being wrong.<br>

<br>
I have read a lot on this, and I think it is very possible that the early Christians did not worship Jesus as divine.  A lot of theologians believe that Jesus never claimed to be God and that his message was corrupted by later followers, such as Paul.  As far as Christian groups today, I don't know of any that specifically teach that Jesus is not divine, though there are certainly individuals who have their doubts and I have friends who joined a Universalist Unitarian Church for that reason.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for responding, I find all this interesting.<br>
