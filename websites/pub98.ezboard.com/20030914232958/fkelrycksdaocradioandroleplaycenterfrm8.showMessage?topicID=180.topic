It was always foggy here, she thought, or raining. Water everywhere. So different from her home. <br>
<br>
&quot;Have I changed?&quot; she murmured, shaking her head. She knew she had not. Her eyes were still the same, her lips, her smile. Her voice still echoed with the timbre of the desert sands of her youth. <br>
<br>
Two days ago, he had wanted her, reaching for her, adoring her, touching her most intimate feelings. Now, he looked away. Now, she had nothing. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am nothing,&quot; she whispered into the wind, lifting her face, tears merging with the falling raindrops. It had rained thus for days now. <br>
<br>

It was hard not to look at the dappling on the forest floor and remember dreams and hopes, now dashed. It was hard not to reach for the pendant that once hung around her neck, the golden bird he'd given her. It no longer was there. She'd buried it in the damp soil many paces behind her. <br>
<br>
Lost in self-pity, eyes brimming with tears that threatened to roll down her cheeks again, she moved through the forest. Even with the dark depths of her heart, her steps were light and even, a dancer's steps. It was that agility that saved her, even then, as a large furred form crashed through the underbrush in front of her, swiping a huge paw at her. She saw only black matted fur, large yellowed teeth and ivory claws nearly as long as her fingers. Crying out, she backed, reaching for the slender weapon that hung at her side. <br>
<br>
&quot;Stop!&quot; she cried, turning the magical force of her voice on the beast as she'd been taught by her mentors. For a moment, the animal paused, snuffling in confusion. Then with a roar, it surged forward again, jaws gnashing, flecks of pink foam frothing on its lips. <br>
<br>
Quickly, she danced back, blocking a slashing paw with the small shield she carried, thrusting the slender metal weapon forward. The enraged beast gave her no more quarters, slapping and snapping at her, ever pressing forward. Its fetid breath rolled over her as she blocked another bite and twisted to the side. There, the fur was already matted with blood, and the stub of an arrow jutted between ribs. A moment's pity for the beast was ended by a slamming paw that splintered her shield. Dropping the protection, she sang of death as she thrust her weapon forward, seeking the heart of the furred animal. <br>
<br>
As quickly as he had come, he was gone, crumpling to the ground with one last wheezing breath. She stood over the beast, shaking, blood spattering the supple leathers she'd once been so proud of. Silence still hung in the forest, the birds and trees seeming to have paused to watch the battle. <br>
<br>
And then the silence was broken again. &quot;Well done,&quot; a voice said behind her. <br>

The man there stood silently now, arms crossed over his chest, one blond eyebrow lifted into a quirk.  &quot;Who...,&quot; she rasped, then paused, swallowing away the dryness in her throat.  &quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; she began again, dipping into a graceful curtsey, but making no move yet to sheathe her blade.  &quot;Was this poor beast one you hunted?  I'm new to this land, and I...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I can tell,&quot; he nodded, grinning quickly as he interrupted her.  &quot;For one, ye talk a mite more politely than the wenches hereabout.  But as to yer question, nay, that wasn't a beast I hunted.&quot;  Almost effortlessly, he shrugged out of his pack, setting it on the ground before him.  He knelt, tugging a binding open, then pulling out a green cloth.  &quot;Here.  Ye need a bit o' cleaning up, lass.&quot;  He tossed the cloth to her.<br>
<br>
She caught the towel in her left hand, dark eyes still wide and on the man, until she remembered herself and her training.  It would never do to imply that she was equal to the men of this land.  &quot;My thanks, sir.&quot;  Eyes downcast now, she curtseyed again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye'd best stop that now, before I grow used to it,&quot; he said, chuckling.  &quot;There's a stream over yonder.
