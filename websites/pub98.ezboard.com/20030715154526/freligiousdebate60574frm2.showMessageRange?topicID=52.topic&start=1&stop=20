<br>
If a Jewish boy is a man after his Bar Mitz 'vah (sp?) and a Mormon child is considered at age 8 to be intellectually, emotionally and socially mature enough to make decisions about his/her eternal soul then do these groups support or object to trying 8 year olds (or 12 year olds) as adults? Why? If you can understand and articulate about concepts such as justice, peace, god, spirits etc. and make the most important decision of your life about it and you demonstrate to elders that you know what is right and wrong why treat you differently under the law?<br>
<br>
P.S. I disagree 8 year old children fully understand these things and can make decisions like an adult would, so I don't want kids tried as adults--but I'm an atheist.<br>

Well baptising isn't a legal issue, but if you mean change the age of consent then 18 doesn't sound bad to me. I could even sort of see 15 or 16 since I'm also more inclined to think a 16 year old is mature enough to be tried as an adult (I guess I don't equate physically and mentally mature teens with children). I don't remember the age for JWs but even if 18 were a little older than necessary for some that might be ready at 16 or 17, what's the terrible harm in waiting? I'm curious if you apply this to ANY other area of life...after all isn't this decision more important than picking a car or job?<br>
<br>
You must be 16 to work and drive.<br>
You must be 18 to legally engage in commerce like contracts without a co-signer.<br>
You must be 21 to drink (in most places, I know it's 19 in others)<br>
You must be-what is it 17? to see a rated R movie.<br>
You must be 18 to marry in most states or rent an apartment.<br>
You are 17 or 18 when attending college.<br>
You must be 18 to go to war.<br>
<br>
Would you let an 8 year old make ANY of these decisions? Would you consider him mentally, physically or socially mature, informed or in any way prepared?<br>
<br>
Oh---I forgot another interesting fact...LDS missionaries (according to their own site) go on their missions at age 19 for men and 21 for women (I know you can go later, but this is the minimun age right??). Seems so much more logical to me to have a mission follow a major commitment to a belief system--like baptism so 18 sounds pretty darn appropriate to me.<br>

There are many years spent preparing to go on a mission. It's not something you suddenly decide one day. The boys receive the priesthood at age 12 and start will responsibilities such as passing the sacrament and move on from there.<br>

<br>
As an aside, I am sickened every time the media reports another story of a minor being tried as an adult.  We have a juvenile justice system for a reason.  IMO, it is not simply that children have an inferior capacity to understand the ramifications of their actions or their own personal responsibility to act in accordance with the laws (though these are certainly valid arguments) but that, when a minor commits a crimes, there are other entities who must necessarily share in the blame -- who failed in providing this child an appropriate gauge for right and wrong.<br>
<br>
My father does criminal defense work, much of which is pro-bono.  He has clients whose parents put beer in their baby bottles to make them sleepy and easier to manage, who've bounced through foster home after foster home after their parents are jailed for drug use, who've grown up with no stable home life and an anemic education in inner-city schools.  Then, when they wind up in trouble with the law, we say, &quot;They should have known better.  Try that 15 year old as an adult.&quot;<br>

In fact I count on it as an atheist in the minority in this country and hope theists will support my parental rights as I support theirs. <br>
<br>
Baptism is more a religions issue, but I think what we're getting at is the underlying premise. It won't harm a child, but then neither would allowing him to choose whatever he wants to eat every day. He could choose poorly based on bad examples just as he would with religion becaue 8 is not old enough to have sense and separate onesself from ones parents and be educated enough to make an informed, mature decision. But LDS says yes they are and they are mature and smart and responsible enough to make the most important decision. If you truly believe this, you must apply the belief evenly across the board. It may be that you feel 8 year olds are old, wise and mature enough to make decisions about religion and eternity only and not movies, cars, war, marriage, sex, apartments, etc. but I doubt you'd get support for that.<br>
<br>
BTW--I think baby baptism is seen differently. Your baptism as well as that of the JW sect is more like a the Catholic sacrament of confirmation----the one that I neeeeever quite made it to<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Just wanted to jump in here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   JWs don't have a specific age that we have to wait for.  It is more like we wait until we know that there is understanding.  Before anyone is baptized we go over some Bible based questions with the Elders in our congregation.  This way we have to actually &quot;prove&quot; our understanding of our beliefs before we make type of committment.  <br>
<br>
My husband was raised as a Witness and he was baptized at the age of 15.  I have seen some that are younger, some where around 12 at the yougest, but it is the personal choice of the parent and Elders of that congregation.  I am personally going to have my kids wait until they are older.  <br>
<br>
My oldest daughter is a people pleaser and at this point I know that she would do it for me, but I want her to do it for herself.  My ex-husband is not a Witness and, as you can imagine, has some problems with his kids being raised as such. (He should have thought about that before he decided to have an affair for over a year with my so-called friend.)  So my kids have some real issues to deal with and he will have an influence in thier lives.  I want thier decision to be well educated and know all of the factors in mind before that decision is made.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that is my little tangent, sorry to go off like that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And might I add, he also should have thought of that before having children with a witness and agreeing to have them raised as such (I'm assuming alot here so if you converted later I suppose it wouldn't apply). I feel strongly about atheist parents sticking up for their rights and not acquiescing to the theist partner, but I also feel strongly that they should think of that and discuss it up front. It's not fair to agree to something then change your mind afterward when it's so important--I certainly wouldn't appreciate it if dh went religious then changed what he agreed to with our kids.<br>

Having a parent out of the church makes it interesting and mixed marriages have the same problems, but you will likely have much more influence as the mother and primary care giver. If he was baptized in the Kingdom Hall and is an apostate then kudos to you for not severing contact between him and his children. I know this is more of an issue for JW than say, an ex-Catholic and his Catholic wife.<br>

I was never bat mitzvahed since we weren't a religious family.  I went to one year of Hebrew school, and I told my mom I didn't want to do it anymore.  She didn't force me.  If I would have continued Hebrew school, then I would have gone from age 8 to 12, and then been bat mitzvahed after that.  The bat mitzvah would have been my sign to the world that I know how to read and comprehend the Torah, not that I was ready to go out and vote or buy beer.  I do feel that at age 12 and 13 there are certain aspects of life a child should know better about, and one could argue that in that sense they have reached part of their adulthood.  I knew that killing was wrong.  I knew that stealing was wrong.  There are a lot of issues I knew better about, and it didn't take any religious scripture to tell me that.  If I would have decided to go out and commit murder at 13, then I would have done it knowing full well the magnitude of my actions, along with the consequences.  I believe that juvenile laws should be in place to protect kids from the stupid little mistakes kids make.  When I was 15, I was on a fieldtrip at Disneyland, and the group of kids I was with started shoplifting.  I knew better than to steal, and I should have walked away and hung out with another group, but I instead got caught up in it, and we had a good time until we got busted lifting just one more thing on the way back to the bus.  We didn't get arrested, but if we would have gotten arrested, then I would have been glad that those records would have been sealed by my 18th birthday.  I don't look at murder the same way I do shoplifting because shoplifting is just an inconsiderate act instead of a cruel one with the intention to hurt someone else.  I got suspended from school, grounded for a month and totally mortified on my high school campus because everyone knew about it.  I learned from this mistake pretty quick, and there was no need to have it disrupt my entire life.  I am now a CPA who is very adamant about following ethics, both personally and professionally, and I always maintain my integrity.  That action could have had the potential to me getting licensed if it would have been on record.  Murder is more than a &quot;kid thing&quot;, and it takes a cold-hearted person to look into the eyes of another and watch the life drain out.  That isn't something that goes away with maturity, nor does the person go through a transformation when they hit their 18th birthday.  If we are talking about a 6 or 7 year old committing murder, then that is one thing, but by 15 or 16 years old they do know better, and I do feel they need to be held accountable for their actions.  The kids that did the school shooting in Arkansas are going to be released by their 21st birthdays, and one of the fathers is scared to death that this kid is going to get out and hurt someone because whatever it was that caused him to commit murder several years ago isn't going away as he matures.  Maturity comes when a person can really grasp the magnitude of their actions, but certain actions are serious to people of any age.<br>

If getting baptized determines the rest of your life, there would not be so many athiests and agnostics here who were once baptized into religion.<br>
<br>
The reason we believe that a child can/should be baptized at age eight is because we believe that baptism is a saving ordinance.  Before the age of accountability, children are innocent and cannot sin, make mistakes yes, sin no.  After they have a grasp on right and wrong, they become accountible for their actions and can sin.  So in order to enter into a covenant with Christ.  ( I will do my part, try to be good and obedient to the gospel principles and He will forgive the sins of which I have repented) we are baptized.  Then we are confirmed members of the church and recieve the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands by an elder.<br>
<br>
But any person at any age can choose not to be a member of the church.  They either just stop participating or if they feel strongly enough about it they can have their name removed from the records of the church, which in effect nullifies their baptism.  <br>

<br>
We believe that baptism is a saving ordinance.  Which in English means that in order to get to heaven you need to be baptized.  Since not everyone on this earth gets to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ and get babptized we provide this for them vicariously (Christ suffered for our sins vicariously, he did something for us we couldnt do on our own)  So we provide the opportunity to be baptized.   That does not mean that every person for whom we are baptized will accept that work.  It is still a choice, they can accept the baptism or they can reject it.<br>
<br>
Truth is absolute.  All roads don't lead to Rome.  Respecting someone's right to belief does not mean I have to aquiesse my own beliefs just to make em happy or comfortable.<br>
<br>
If we are right, which of course I believe we are.  It is a compassionate thing to give someone this necessary gift/opportunity, which we believe we are directed to do.  If we are wrong, I doubt God will judge someone for something we did for them.<br>
<br>
Thats my 2 cents on the matter.<br>
<br>
On having their names removed, it is a simple process.  You make the request in writing.  You are ex communicated.  Ex communication does involve a process called a church court.  Which really is just a meeting with the high council ( local leaders) to be sure that you understand what you are asking.  They want to make sure there isnt a resolvable concern.  ( my dad and dh's dad were both bishops and were involved in this process and it seemed pretty straigtforward to me)<br>
<br>
I think most people who leave just stop attending.<br>

I wasn't a Witness when we were married.  I converted later.  So it doesn't apply, but when you end your marriage with someone, you influence over that person stops, so if he wouldn't have fooled around, I probably wouldn't be a Witness now.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The thing with him though is he is one of those theist the say they believe in God but don't live thier lives like they do.  He cares only about himself, lazy, did I mention that he only cares about himself?  When we talk about what to teach the kids when it comes to religion he says that he wants them to decide.  I am fine with that.  So it is my job as a parent to teach them what I believe is right (just like all parents do), and them he can teach them what he believes is right.  (You are right, I will have more influence since they live with me.)  Well, he wants them to choose now, they are 8 years old and 6 years old. (Talk about the age of accountability.)  I told him to teach them what he believes and then they can choose when they are older.  This is what he said, and I quote &quot;I just thought that we could teach them nothing.&quot;  How is that for lazy?  He just doesn't want to take the time to teach them anything, that would require effort on his part. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
He was never baptized, but it is ironic because his mom was a long time ago and she is now disfellowshipped.  This is no problem for me because she gets to see them when he has them.  (She lives about 100 miles from me so I don't take the kids to see her when I have them.)  He had more exposure to Witnesses when he was younger than I had ever before but he thinks the beliefs are too restrictive.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, enough of my life story.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
