<br>
When I worked at a horse stable in Wyoming there were 2 books in an office. The Bible and ‘Lust For Life.’ I read ‘Lust For Life’ first.  It’s sad to me that Van Gogh didn’t get the recognition he does today. And its kind of sick how much money people make off his art now.<br>
<br>
He was a preacher and evangelist before he did only art. He was at a coal mine and instead of living in the house that was provided for him he went and lived among the people who worked in the mines to evangelize them. I don’t think he found what he was looking for thru his religion.<br>
It was after I read that book that I stared thinking about the bible. Then read that also. <br>
<br>
A couple years later when I was driving to the east coast I heard this song on the radio. If you haven’t heard it…the music adds a lot. Its in a minor key…an acoustic guitar and the singer.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Starry, starry night<br>
Paint your palette blue and gray<br>
Look out on a summer's day<br>
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul...<br>
Shadows on the hills<br>
Sketch the trees and the daffodils<br>
Catch the breeze and the winter chills<br>
In colors on the snowy linen land.<br>
Now I understand<br>
What you tried to say, to me<br>
And how you suffered for your sanity<br>
And how you tried to set them free:<br>
They would not listen; they did not know how --<br>
Perhaps they'll listen now.<br>
Starry, starry night<br>
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze<br>
Swirling clouds in violet haze<br>
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue<br>
Colors changing hue<br>
Morning fields of amber grain<br>
Weathered faces lined in pain<br>
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand.<br>
Now I understand<br>
What you tried to say, to me<br>
And how you suffered for your sanity<br>
And how you tried to set them free:<br>
They would not listen; they did not know how--<br>
Perhaps they'll listen now.<br>
For they could not love you<br>
But still, your love was true<br>
And when no hope was left inside<br>
On that starry, starry night<br>
You took your life as lovers often do--<br>
But I could've told you, Vincent:<br>
This world was never meant<br>
For one as beautiful as you.<br>
Starry, Starry night<br>
Portraits hung in empty halls<br>
Frameless heads on nameless walls<br>
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget<br>
Like the strangers that you've met<br>
The ragged men in ragged clothes<br>
The silver thorn, a bloody rose<br>
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.<br>
Now I think I know<br>
What you tried to say, to me<br>
And how you suffered for your sanity<br>
And how you tried to set them free:<br>
They would not listen; they're not listening still--<br>
Perhaps they never will.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I almost never hear it on the radio. <br>
<br>
you might be able to download it from buymusic.com<br>
<br>
you can get songs that will play in windows movie player...most cost 99 cents each! and you can burn them to cd's. <br>
<br>
I think Van Gogh only sold one painting in his lifetime. People didnt like it. His style was much different then what people did at the time...the colors....the brush strokes.<br>
<br>
'Lust for Life' is a good book..if you like reading its worth it.<br>
<br>
I've also read a collection of letters Van Gogh sent to his brother.<br>

ths song is called &quot;Vincent&quot; but it was called &quot;Starry Starry Night' more often so they added that as a subtitle.<br>
<br>
it's $1.09.....and you can hear a little of it also.<br>

<br>
this is one of the saddest songs i have ever heard. maybe because i've read alot about him and probably relate to him in some way. the minor chords really make more haunting. i think you need to actually hear it to understand what i mean.<br>
<br>
i thought of it this morning because my daughter went to an art camp for a week recently. it was for a few hours each afternoon. they did 'the masters'. one was Van Gogh.<br>
<br>
So today I played the song for her in the car (she's 6)...and she asked me if that was Van Gogh singing. I'm trying to drive and she's in the backseat asking all these questions about the song..i'm trying to answer...while crying! <br>
<br>
she asks....whats wrong mommy?   i tried to explain it. I'll have to do it again because on the ride home alone i thought of betters ways to explain it her. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wihinape>Wihinape</A> at: 8/12/03 11:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oneandonlyfemme>One and Only Femme</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://pages.prodigy.net/indianahawkeye/newpage24/15.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Five-Star Drama Queen</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#B87333>(8/13/03 8:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/bat3193/smiley15/slotmach1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Starry Starry Night</span><hr size=1> Van Gogh was a really interesting individual<br>

<br>
He wrote almost 700 letters to his brother, who kept most of them. So we can really see his thoughts.<br>
<br>
Sorry if this a long post…here are some segments of some letters about his Christianity. <br>
<br>
<br>
First a segment of a writing from someone about him being a pastor:<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>. . despite the onset of winter, he continued to visit the miners and to give away whatever wretched clothing he had left and to pass on any food he could afford from the pittance his parents were occasionally able to send him. . . . the Decrugs [the family he was staying with] pitied him but felt powerless to stop him. . . . they could hear Vincent weeping to himself at night . . .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
At the end of this post is a segment about him being removed from his pastor position<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Letter to his brother:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Dear Theo,<br>
It is more than time for you to hear from me again. Thank God you are recovering. I am longing so much for Christmas - that time will be here perhaps before we know it, though it seems long now. Theo, your brother has preached for the first time, last Sunday, in God's dwelling, of which is written, “In this place, I will give peace.” Enclosed a copy of what I said. May it be the first of many.<br>
When I was standing in the pulpit, I felt like somebody who, emerging from a dark cave underground, comes back to the friendly daylight. It is a delightful thought that in the future wherever I go, I shall preach the Gospel; to do that sell, one must have the Gospel in one's heart. May the Lord give it to me.<br>
<br>
You know enough of life, Theo, to understand that a poor preacher stands rather alone in the world, but the Lord can increasingly rouse in us the consciousness and belief in “... yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.”<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yesterday evening I was again at Richmond, and walked through a large grassy field surrounded by trees and houses, over which the church spire rises. The dew was lying on the grass and the twilight was falling: on one side the sky was still aglow from the setting sun, on the other, the moon was rising. Under the trees an old lady with beautiful grey hair was walking, dressed in black. In the middle of the grass plot the boys had lit a bonfire which one could see flickering from afar. I thought of the lines: “Once at the evening of my life, tired from care and strife, I'll bring Thee praise more loud and fair, for each day given to me here.”<br>
<br>
Thursday week I hope to preach on John and Theogenes in Mr. Jones's church. Your brother was indeed deeply moved when he stood at the foot of the pulpit and bowed his head and prayed: Abba, Father, in Thy name be our beginning.<br>
Psalm 119: 19. `I am a stranger on the earth, hide not Thy commandments from me.'<br>
It is an old belief and it is a good belief, that our life is a pilgrim's progress - that we are strangers on the earth, but that though this be so, yet we are not alone for our Father is with us. We are pilgrims, our life is a long walk or journey from earth to Heaven.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is a good word that of St. Paul: as being sorrowful yet always rejoicing. For those who believe in Jesus Christ, there is no death or sorrow that is not mixed with hope - no despair - there is only a constantly being born again, a constantly going from darkness into light. They do not mourn as those who have no hope - Christian Faith makes life to evergreen life.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Segment about him being removed:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;The experiment of accepting the services of a young Dutchman, Mr. Vincent van Gogh, who felt himself called to be an evangelist in the Borinage, has not produced the anticipated results. If a talent for speaking, indispensable to anyone placed at the head of a congregation, had been added to the admirable qualities he displayed in aiding the sick and wounded, to his devotion to the spirit of self-sacrifice, of which he gave many proofs by consecrating his night's rest to them, and by stripping himself of most of his clothes and linen in their behalf, Mr. Van Gogh would certainly have been an accomplished evangelist.<br>
&quot;Undoubtedly it would be unreasonable to demand extraordinary talents. But it is evident that the absence of certain qualities may render the exercise of an evangelist's principal function wholly impossible.<br>
&quot;Unfortunately this is the case with Mr. Van Gogh.
