<br>
The sun had risen, hanging among beautiful white, peaceful clouds.  the ocean waves breached tenderly upon the shore, crystal blue and shimmering.<br>
<br>
Laurena laid in the mids tof the surf, half awake.<br>
<br>
At first, she thought she was dead.  But then, she felt the water against her cold, soaked skin and knew she was alive.  As she moved a bit, she felt that both her wings were broken.  She could barely breathe, her chest tight. Biting back tears of pain, she rolled over onot her stomach and grasped the wet sand in her hands, thankful and disappointed at once that she was alive.<br>
<br>
Aeli.<br>
<br>
Where was Aeli?<br>
<br>
She looked about desperately, her heart pounding in her chest.  Azalea was no where to be found. The beach was a peaceful, paradise like place, for more beatiful in comparison to Lapis.<br>
<br>
And then, she saw him.<br>
<br>
Among the waves.<br>
<br>
His body floating face down, seagulls flying about him curiously.<br>
<br>
She screamed, but her voice was so hoarse from the salt water that it came out as a bare squeak.  She crawled throught the gentle surf, getting up, stumbling, an crawling again as she fell into the water, forgetting to think or breathe until she reached his side, waving the curious scavengers away.  She turned him upward.<br>
<br>
He was so pale.  He couldn't be... Laurena pressed her ear against his chest, praying, hoping, crying...<br>
<br>
Yes....<br>
<br>
Yes!<br>
 <br>
A faint heartbeat, still there, but ever so faint...fighting to live.<br>
<br>
Laurena cried out, praising the gods with her weak, tired voice.  The poison..the poiosn was killinghim...frantically she grasped hold of the ankh arounf her neck, that glowed in response to her touch.<br>
<br>
Seh placed it against the bite mark on his arm.  Suddenly her arm and his glowed with their life enegries, his being very faint, hers dull as well.  But her glow was injected into his body, filling him with light and life.  The poison, a dark green against the golden glow of his energy, began to seep from his veins into hers, where it dissapated and made her energy glow go almost as faded as his had been.  When she took it away the bite was gone, and he was healthy looking again, but still nconscious.<br>
<br>
Laurena felt faint, tired.  &quot;Aeli...I love you...please don't die...please...I'm so, so sorry, I never meant any of this to happen...it's all my fault, all of it...please don't die...&quot; she whispered before falling gently on him, her soaked head resting on his chest as she fell into a deep state of weakened slumber.  <br>
<br>
The surf washed over them gently, and the seagulls dared not come near.<br>

<br>
&quot;You there! Stop right there and don't move!&quot;<br>

Laurena loked up.  A group of gold-winged sirens were steadily approaching, holding spears with caution.  They saw her and their eyes widened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Phoenix!&quot;<br>
<br>
They ran over and lifted her away from Aeli.  She fought against them, not wanting to be parted from him, but she couldn't fight against them.  <br>

&quot;Who's this, Phoenix?&quot; one of them asked <br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli...Aeli...&quot; she repeated, reaching for him and paying no heed to them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bring him along,&quot; their fair haired leader ordered.  &quot;Be gentle with him, he looks injured. They both do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Liriea.&quot;  A few carried Laurena off, and another few picked up aeli and carried him, gently, to the village.<br>

She tried to hide it, but the sunlight betrayed her.<br>

<br>
Aeli had kissed her.  He had just kissed her!  Laurena's breath caught and she froze like a hunted rabbit. The wonderful touch lingered on for a few moments that seemed like blissful hours before it passed and she closed her eyes briefly in wonder...<br>
<br>
And saw Lance.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>YOU LILY WHORE!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The siren gasped and, as if she had been burnt by the tender gesture of affection, pulled away quickly and detached her hand from his as her cheek tingled with warmth.  As soon as she had, however, she regretted it, the voice having silenced withn her almost as soon as it had erupted.  She took his hand once more and hugged him tightly, burying her face in his shirt.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so confused,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I don't know what to think anymore...or who to believe.  But I believe you, Aeli--I'll always believe you, no matter what--&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked up at him, and tucked the rogue strands ofhis hair behind his ear lovingly as she stared into the beautiful silver eyes that had broken the amnesia spell.  Her heart ached, and she suffered from some unknown poison of doubt, but she was willing to bear it for him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Always, precious Aeli.  No matter what.&quot;<br>

<br>
Meanwhile, five gold winged sirens walked into the village, carryign a crumpled black clad figure that moaned in fever and was brittle to the touch.<br>

Aeli blinked out of slight confusion of Laurena's sudden contradicting moves. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, i'm sorry.&quot; He shook his head.  &quot;I should've...asked.&quot; His silver eyes rested on her. &quot;Why're you confused?&quot; <p>Sekihoutai PRIDE!<br>

<br>
Laurena looked up at him fearfully.  &quot;I-I've never felt like this.  Something's happening...something bad.  And I'm so confused--I don't know why.  I don't know who to belive anymore.  Azalea told me Lance was dead, but I saw him right--&quot;<br>
<br>
She stopped in the middle of her sentence, words failing her suddenly.  Stammerign a bit, hiding her eyes, she continued.  &quot;I'm afraid.  I'm scared something terrible is going to happen...I can feel it, and it scares me.&quot;  Her hands twisted in her lap nervously. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 801<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(5/17/03 11:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Speechless</span><hr size=1> Aeli embraced Laurena, hold her tightly in  his arms.<br>

<br>
&quot;Thank you...&quot;<br>
<br>
How could she tel him what she truly felt? She didn't want him to protect her...she wanted him to just be happy.<br>
<br>
She loved him too much to lose him over battles she should be fighting.  Battles she couldn't fight because she was so weak.<br>
<br>
She looked up at him, hesitantly.  She shouldn't...but he was reaching out to her.  She could feel it.  But what if something happened? What if her siren magic overpowered him...<br>
<br>
But he had such beautiful eyes...<br>
<br>
She gently stroked his scarred cheek, careful of the tender skin.  She was not afriad of the demon within him.  She knew she should be, but she wasn't.  She felt love for both sides...half elf and demon alike.<br>
<br>
She loved him for him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli...&quot; she whispered softly, heart pounding as she leaned closer to his face...she felt his breath on her face...closer...<br>
<br>
&quot;Phoenix!&quot;<br>
<br>
She pulled away as five sirens came in, carrying a black clad figure.  She stood up.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We found her by the shore.  She keeps saying your name,&quot; one explained.<br>
<br>
Laurena looked down.  She saw Azalea's pallid face, her eyes half lidded in delirious fever. She looked much different from the powerful sorceress-like being from last night.  She was weak and as frail as the shadow of the black moon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Laurena...have I protected her?...Laurena,&quot; she moaned fitfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Azalea!&quot; she cried. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 804<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(5/18/03 12:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Speechless</span><hr size=1> In his mind, Aeli almost panicked as he felt Laurena get closer.

<br>
&quot;Will she be alright?&quot; He asked, getting  up and standing next to Laurena. &quot;Azalea, she's alright. Don't worry...&quot;<br>

She knelt down beside her, grasping her ankh.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Azalea's shaking hand came out to stop her.  &quot;Please...&quot;  She dug into her soaked pockets and pulled out a small bag that smelled strangely of lavender.  Her voice was hoarse and wispy.  &quot;Just stir up my potion for me, if you will....and I will be fine, dear siren.&quot;  She closed her tired eyes in sleep.<br>
<br>
Laurena bowed.  &quot;Yes, Azalea.&quot;  Her eyes were filled with tears.  &quot;Keep a watch on her.  I'll go get water.&quot;  and with a guilty look on her face she left, holding the small bag as if it were a precious creature. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0
