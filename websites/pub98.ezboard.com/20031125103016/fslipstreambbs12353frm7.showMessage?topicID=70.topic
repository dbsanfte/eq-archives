<br>
We finally got a Kiene/Rienkemeyer episode this season that I didn't dislike, this was okay. Sure, it ripped off a half-dozen first contact episodes from Star Trek, and redid Rev Bem's plot with Bloodmist, but this is a definite improvement for this season. There was some interesting stuff going on here, but that in itself hints at a problem. These are among the departing writers this season, they'll soon join Miller/Stentz as Andromeda alumni. When those writers left, the touches they considered important to the characters and the series left with them. So what's the big deal?<br>
<br>
As I watch the Nietzchean story unfold here, I was left wondering whether it meant anything. Will this story die with the departure of these writers? Or is this keeping with whatever &quot;master vision&quot; we'll see for the rest of the series? The third season has a very sloppy record with story arcs, new ones are added as old plots are discarded with all the loose ends left hanging. It's hard to keep up. And that's pretty much my reaction to this episode. Will this mean anything? Is this signaling a new direction? Or will this story arc be abandoned/mishandled like some of the previous ones? If this heralds the course of the show, we have much to look forward to.<br>
<br>
The story begins with the Andromeda escorting a Commonwealth convoy. They are soon attacked by old Nietzchean ship footage, which the Andromeda fights without enthusiasm. Apparently Dylan is under loose orders, he abandons the convoy to pursue something more interesting. Dylan decides to take a Nietzchean prisoner on board to ask him what's going on. (Yes, I know there's a deep plot of the powerful Nietzcheans attacking minority Nietzcheans, but who cares. These Nietzcheans are always attacking somebody, usually each other.)<br>
<br>
The prisoner explains that the tougher Nietzcheans are seeking a slip-scout, a robot vessel designed to map the slipstream points. Three hundred years ago, when the Nietzcheans were not laughable self-caricatures, they were capable of great technologies, even this. (I'm trying to be insulting, but Tyr actually makes this same point in the episode, that the modern Nietzcheans are jokes compared to their ancestors.)<br>
<br>
So now the chase is on for the gadget, and what a relief it's not some mystical artifact like the Engine of Creation or the Shards of Rimni. Science fiction, a refreshing change of premise from last week.<br>
<br>
Commercial break, it's one of those anti-marijuana ads that detail how one joint is equivalent to four cigarettes. And this is going to stop who? Woohoo, the power of four cigarettes, it's like Mountain Dew! Dumb ads. <br>
<br>
Being lonely for Nietzchean conversation, Tyr chats with his fellow &quot;orphan&quot;. It's nice to see Tyr has someone to talk to, but this is just a repeat of Bloodmist from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Widening Gyre.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Watch the Nietzchean tempt Tyr to leave the &quot;kludges&quot; and join him, together they will rule the galaxy. Seen it, rejected it, let's move along please.<br>
<br>
But then we get a couple good scenes. Gaiton makes a crack about Tyr's perceived subservience to Dylan, and Tyr punches him unconscious over Dylan's protests. Just asserting his independence, cute. Then Rommie calculates the probable location of this slip-scout, an Earthlike planet with primitive humans who only have radios and satellites. (You know, this could have been an easy way to get rid of the Bellerophon crew that joined them. Just tell them that Earth has returned to a more basic existence, and drop them off before they get wise.)<br>
<br>
Rommie gets in a good joke about Tyr, nice to see Lexa given lines beyond what, oh about 93% of what she has been given to work with the rest of the season. Harper announces (on a flatscreen monitor clearly labeled <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IBM</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->) that he has whipped up universal translators and travel papers for them. By the way, IBM somehow became an official sponsor of the show this season, so this is no accident but well-timed product placement. Hey, if each product placement can pay for one more crew member, I say bring it all in. Merchandizing, merchandizing, where the real money is made!<br>
<br>
There's a minor threat of pursuing Nietzcheans, but that doesn't stop Dylan Hunt from initiating first contact protocols. Of course, these are actually Dylan's personal protocols for getting laid. He piously warns the rest of the away team (which inexplicably includes the Nietzchean prisoner Gaiton) not to mention anything to the inhabitants about them being from space. Right after that, Dylan wows a local lady with tales of his amazing spaceship and how he has come many light years to fertilize her from beyond.<br>
<br>
Dylan's conduct is entirely predictable in keeping with his character, but at last we have equal time for the ladies. Beka is wowed by a civilian doctor, and goes right after him like Elaine Benes would. Good for Beka, it's about time! I have no problem with Dylan's loose morals as long as the rest get the same opportunity. She has her way with him, and then splits after her needs are met. She's learned well, for every student there is a master. She and Dylan have a run-in with the local police, but easily beat them up as usual. It's hard to take threats seriously on this show when it always looks like a bunch of wheelchair-bound old ladies could beat up the locals, too.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Tyr and Bloodmist, I mean Gaiton, locate the hard drive from the slip-scout. Here Gaiton makes his main pitch, that he is really a spy for the tougher Nietzcheans, and then he peels away a mask (figuratively), and reveals that he really really is a fellow Nietzchean like Tyr. Tyr humors him until they get back on the Maru, but he can only take so many speeches from this guy before he shoots him twice. He was probably holding back.<br>
<br>
If you're fast-forwarding through this a second time like I was, you see the humorous scene of Tyr and Gaiton embracing on the planet surface. Coming right after the embraces of Dylan and Beka with their conquests, you have to wonder. (But they were just fighting.)<br>
<br>
Dylan shows his brief girlfriend around the Maru, and then shows her the airlock. Real convenient for Dylan, great way to avoid commitments. Get what you need and go. And of course she can't come with him, because that would be corrupting the local culture. (Thank goodness they made sure that didn't happen.)<br>
<br>
The show closes with Tyr looking at his funny Nietzchean plant, as Dylan comes through the door and declares they need to have a chat. What is this, All My Children? That's the way they end scenes, this should feel very familiar to Tyr. (Please don't let Tyr leave with a hologram goodbye like Rev Bem got.)<br>
<br>
Okay, so I didn't have anything scorching to say about this episode. For a third season episode, it was decent. I only wish the rest of this season had been written like this. Does this point the show to a promising direction, a new clarity? Or will this sort of story be discarded as soon as the writers finish cleaning out their desks? Only time will tell.<br>
<br>
So what lesson to take from this? Well, the Andromeda universe started out perfect. Season one, they could do no wrong (unless you count those fish people). Season two, they tried to improve it. Season three, they tried to change it, only they ruined it. Let us hope they can avoid the final part of the prophecy, that by continuing the mistakes of this season, they will lose it altogether. There is still time to turn around the direction of the show, and stories like this point the way. Nice to see. <br>

Last night I watched a late airing of the latest <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Enterprise</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> episode, &quot;Horizon&quot;. In it we explore Mayweather's ties with his family, his concerns and hopes. By the writing of this episode, Mayweather is a real person. When one looks at Tyr's alleged character development in this episode, there's simply no comparison. Mayweather is a person. Tyr is a cartoon, and a bad one at that. This is character development? Not by any standard on any other science ficton show. <br>
<br>
That's precisely why Keith Hamilton Cobb is leaving, because even Mayweather on Enterprise gets better character development than Tyr. <br>

Sure, it ripped off a half-dozen first contact episodes from Star Trek, and redid Rev Bem's plot with Bloodmist, but this is a definite improvement for this season.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I didn't feel like this was retreading Bloodmist's plot - rather - this was showing what we should have seen no later than the first half of season 2.  Hey, wait a minute - wasn't that when we got Bloodmist's plot? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Well - you are right in that we finally saw what Magog truly are in The Widening Gyre, the way we finally see what Nietzscheans truly are in DMV.  But if that's a retread of a plot - then we need lots of these - while we're at it, I'd like a retread of what Artificial Lifeforms truly are, and what Perseids truly are, and what the Than truly are...  Just a thought....<br>
<br>

<br>
You have no idea how profoundly correct you are. (Or maybe you have every idea!)  The ONLY writers to write Tyr sympathetically were Matt and Joe.  They were the only ones to deal with Nietzscheans on Nietzschean terms - the only ones to NOT use them as mere plot devices, or to look down on them.  THIS view of the Nietzscheans - the idea that Gaiton/Tyr are what Nietzscheans are SUPPOSED to be, and that it is gloriously superior - this walks out the door with Matt and Joe... and I don't know who is going to resurrect that idea, if anyone ever does.  It is highly doubtful - because the current administration of Drom has been trying all season long to kill it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>As I watch the Nietzchean story unfold here, I was left wondering whether it meant anything. Will this story die with the departure of these writers? Or is this keeping with whatever &quot;master vision&quot; we'll see for the rest of the series? The third season has a very sloppy record with story arcs, new ones are added as old plots are discarded with all the loose ends left hanging. It's hard to keep up. And that's pretty much my reaction to this episode. Will this mean anything? Is this signaling a new direction? Or will this story arc be abandoned/mishandled like some of the previous ones? If this heralds the course of the show, we have much to look forward to.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
[cynical Drom view] I wouldn't worry.  The Nietzschean storyline shown here started a couple of eps ago, continued last week, and will continue until Tyr exits the show.  That's going to be sweet.  Every other plot will fail miserably. [/cynical Drom view]<br>

[cDv] We need a way to make Dylan the star of a Nietzschean storyline.  It can't be done, but if we give him enough minutes, the actor won't notice.  Write a lot of pointless stuff that lets the actor think he's a hero.[/cDv]<br>

<br>
Being lonely for Nietzchean conversation, Tyr chats with his fellow &quot;orphan&quot;. It's nice to see Tyr has someone to talk to, but this is just a repeat of Bloodmist from The Widening Gyre. Watch the Nietzchean tempt Tyr to leave the &quot;kludges&quot; and join him, together they will rule the galaxy. Seen it, rejected it, let's move along please.<br>

Aside from poor character development, poor backstory, bad writing, and unengaging adversaries, this show handles cast transitions very poorly. But other than that, the third season is better than ever. (ahem)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>while we're at it, I'd like a retread of what Artificial Lifeforms truly are, and what Perseids truly are, and what the Than truly are... Just a thought....</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

When the writers themselves don't even seem to know what is going on, worry.<br>

<br>
Well then it's fitting. They depart along with Keith Hamilton Cobb, two birds with one stone. I think it's fair to say the &quot;new direction&quot; the third season represents has been a disaster, not only for the series but in the ratings as well. They've doomed Andromeda to a premature end, the wounds to this show are self-inflicted.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> wouldn't worry. The Nietzschean storyline shown here started a couple of eps ago, continued last week, and will continue until Tyr exits the show. That's going to be sweet. Every other plot will fail miserably.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
So far the handling of Tyr's departure (with this slowly building story) has been the only thing handled right this season.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>In fact, I found it quite instructive if I wanted to learn how to roll a joint...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I read somewhere that the &quot;Tobacco is wacko&quot; ads actually increase cigarette smoking among the target audience.<br>
