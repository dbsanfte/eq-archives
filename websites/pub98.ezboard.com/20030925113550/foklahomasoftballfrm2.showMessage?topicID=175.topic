I know he must have embarrassed this rookie by yelling at him. I was in the stands and heard him and turned around to see who he was yelling at. I feel this was very unproffesional of him. I felt that he should have called him over to the backstop and told him to stop the game and make them change. This really made me mad because I know Boomer has a very high turnover rate, and now I see why. I would have walked right off the field and left him high and dry. I tryed e-mailing boomer so they could take care of this problem. I didn't sign the letter because I didn't want my team to reap the wrathe from Boomer from complaing about it. I am going to cut and paste the response that I recieved. I felt that giving my name was very petty. Shouldn't you be able to criticize or ask questions without giving your name? I thought this was $hitty. Here is the response.<br>
<br>
THANKS FOR YOUR INPUT, BUT -NO NAME-NO RESPONSE<br>
<br>
I didn't like the way this letter was handled. -- just a little FYI. It made me really angry. This guiy had an awesome strike zone and was actually a really good red. He will probably end up running him (and others) off by their tactics. It was ridiculous!!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

PROFIT.. They don't care about taking care of the fields. Nor do they care about keeping Reds. You know why. They don't have to pay them. If you have been in any of Boomers leagues.. The teams pay for the reds before each game. And in tournaments if you don't have to pay for the reds. Boomer jacks up the price of entry fee.... I can understand the fuss of  the not matching uniforms.. Case in point... We were light.... very light gray. We had a league game. One of our guys shows up in white.. Red says he can't play unless he has the proper color of uniform... White and the gray we had was not even really noticeable... Meanwhile... the team we were playing had 3 or 4 different shades of red on... The red allowed them to play.. We had to change. Now it seems to me that Boomer has their favorites. And boomer wants to take care of their favorites. I guess to make a long point short (too late) before babbling on and on.. Boomer sucks to play at... But people still go to play.. Fields are horrible. Run BassAkwards.  But people still go there to play. and booomer knows it. So I guess the best way to send a message.

If you confront him he acts like he has more important things to do and blows you off. It's all an ego trip with him. I called 2 years out there, went to all his camps and meetings, was proactive and never missed a scheduled day to work and still got treated like a nine year old.

we should be happy they had that tournament this weekend with all they had to do to adjust after the tornado. Heck a building a few hundred yards away was flattened. They are the only place that consistently puts on tournaments and gives away pretty good looking Tshirts.<br>
<br>
The fields need a lot of grass work (they are bad), the infields could be ripped up for all I care ( I hate the turf too), the fences could look better (who cares). <br>
<br>
That said, no other park in the state is doing as much to keep softball going as Boomer. Pretty grass is nice, but having a tournament every weekend to give teams a place to play is better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C0D9D9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leftypower>LeftyPower</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#8B0000>(5/12/03 2:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Solution????</span><hr size=1> With all the griping about the fields at Boomer...has anyone come up with a solution???

Same thing with lights, field have to be dry to get lift truck on them. The park is almost 20 years old, and requires more maintance than most of you realize. We had no electricity this last week-end , but we were still the only place in town that played. Hey, we may not be perfect, but we try hard to give teams a place to play. And as for Brian, can anyone name any GOOD umpires that have left Boomer for another park. If all of our umpires did thier job right, He wouldn't have to correct them on the field. He has completly changed the attitude of Boomer umpires(for the better) since he came here. Just ask the veterans   <br>
umpires.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C0D9D9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leftypower>LeftyPower</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#8B0000>(5/12/03 6:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: reply</span><hr size=1> I am not saying you guys don't do a great job.  I think that Boomer is a great place to play.  Out of state teams USE to talk about taking trips to Boomer...but since the fields are so old and are aging quite a bit...they tend to go other places.  Any word on when you will start working on the outfields???  What you are doing is a good start...but lets not let it go after that...it is called &quot;maintaining&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Player</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#8B0000>(5/13/03 7:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Boomer</span><hr size=1> One, is great to hear the maintenance might begin. That will be great. But, when teams think about playing there, THEY DO CONSIDER THE FIELDS as part of the reason to play there. We dont play there unless it is a big tournament or an NIT, the big reason, is due to lack of maintenance on the field itself. We can live with the fences, but the major mountains of weeds in the outfield, just waiting to take a bad hop because of all of the lumpy weeds, the turf (enough said) , just remove the turf, go to dirt infields. I understand how old the park is, but, maintenance can be done to it. I have seen it done at other large parks. (ARDMORE (8 fields) and taken care of a lot better) On the umps, where are they going to go, softball is shrinking and there is NO PLACE to go. Not very many places left to play. That is why we would like to see Boomer take better maintenance of the fields. Your right, Boomer gives us a place to play, but once again, we will drive to farther to play at a better complex. Just my 2 cents. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C0D9D9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sweetp@oklahomasoftball>Sweetp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8B0000>(5/13/03 2:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: reply</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And as for Brian, can anyone name any GOOD umpires that have left Boomer for another park.

Saddam Hussein could have came in and improved what you had before so that's not saying much. I don't care how you sugar coat it, but for a UIC to yell at one of his guys in front of god and everyone is unacceptable, period. A Rookie is expected to make mistakes, but even being a Rookie he deserves enough respect from his boss to be pulled aside privately and corrected professionally. If you're disrespected by your UIC then how the hell are you expected to be respected by the players? Being a Red is hard enough putting up with all the anomosity and bullshit, if your UIC disrespects you then whats the point?<br>
