Summary: The crew of the Andromeda is caught in a storm amongst friends and enemies.<br>
<br>
Harper's usual happy mood was magnified ten fold on this planet. It had been centuries since anyone was allowed on this paradise of a world but finally the inhabitance had agreed to once again see what the universe had to offer. I watched Harper and Trance dance from the balcony of our shared suite. He danced around with Trance in a show of joy that wasn't quite harper-ish. I'd seen him dance, I'd seen him run, jump, and laugh but never this heartfelt. It was wonderful to see him like this. I smiled and leaned against the railing breathing in the clean air. I continued to smile and chuckle at the rambunctious, kids that were slowly finding out what bugs stung and pinched, much to their dismay. I wished I could throw all this commonwealth dignity to the side and roll around in the greenery but I hadn't forgotten that I was here for diplomatic reasons and had to look dignified at all times, even though I was standing on the balcony in my Commonwealth issue pajamas. I guess that wasn't to dignified. My thoughts were interrupted when Harper yelped and ran in place comically trying to shake something big and slimy off his finger. <br>
<br>
&quot;AHHH! Get it off!&quot; he screamed as Trance pried the weird looking bug off his finger and set it down in a near by shrub. She seemed at one with nature and I found myself staring in awe at how she fit in with the purples of the surrounding foliage. Harper wiped his eyes and tried to pull himself together which only sent Trance into a fit of laughter. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey that wasn't funny! Come here!&quot; Harper said lashing out playfully and once again they were on the move. They giggled loudly and I watched shaking my head like any parent would do. I couldn't help but think of them as my kids. Both Trance and Harper had a sort of naive charm. Harper not so much naive but more a rebellious teen that needed to be kept on track. Harper finally caught Trance by the tail and they both laughed loudly before falling back into the multitude of flowers in the huge field. I breathed out heavily and paced back into the room running my hands through my hair and rubbing the back of my neck to release the stress that had been building since the day we had arrived on this planet. The stress and tedium of diplomatic gathering not only bored me but also left me drained. I looked over the huge suite they had given us. The ceiling had to have been over 10 feet high and the room was twice the size of Andromeda's bridge. Sigh…It's been 2 days and I already miss Andromeda. I find myself comparing everything to her…Seeing if paradise measures up to the one I had in orbit around this planet. I trusted Rommie to take care of …er…herself until I got back which would be in 3 more days but it was hard to leave my ship in someone elses hands…Even if it was her own hands. I laughed at my own confusion and  looked over to the two lumps that still laid in bed lazily. Tyr hadn't wanted to come in the first place and since he couldn't find anyone to kill or torment he'd decided to stay in bed and get his beauty sleep, of course with his knife nestled tightly next to him. I shook my head at his lack of trust and turned my attention to the stirring lump in the bed adjacent to his. <br>
<br>
&quot;Could you tell Harper and Trance to keep it down.&quot; Beka groaned, covering her face with a pillow. At that moment Harper decided to burst out into song which only infuriated Beka. <br>
<br>
&quot;Jeremiah was a bullfrog!&quot; Harper screamed following it up with more lyrics. Beka's eyes squinted in anger and she stormed over to the window. <br>
<br>
&quot;Harper! Jeez! Shut-up!&quot; Beka screamed letting the veins pop out of her neck and letting the spit fly.  I drew back knowing an angry Beka wasn't anything to play with.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who was that Harper?&quot; Trance asked innocently. She couldn't see cause of the glare of the sun. Harper looked up shading his eye with his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh don't worry. It was just some blonde lunatic.&quot; Harper said loudly. He gave Beka the finger and stalked off dragging Trance along.  I laughed….Family unity? Yeah right.<br>
<br>
&quot;Finally, some quiet! Between you and Harper's Snoring and Tyr's incessant growling, I've gotten absolutely no sleep. NONE!&quot; She said to me. She stood with boxers and a white tank on. Her hair was frazzled and the bags under her eyes hung loosely. I grimaced and nodded letting her get back to bed immediately. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have a meeting with the Rollan people at 7 and we all must…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut-up Dylan…just…shut-up.&quot; She said dramatically clawing her way back into bed and turning her back towards me. I looked over to Tyr who was looking on quite amused. We both shrugged it off like any man who had been yelled at by a woman would. Tyr growled childishly and Beka stiffened with anger once again covering her face with her pillow and screaming into it. Tyr chuckled and so did I. Under normal circumstances I would never had roomed with the girls…just to keep things proper. But in this society a &quot;family&quot; always roomed together. They had strict rules on family and they wouldn't have even thought of signing onto the commonwealth if we didn't show the same family unity. It had taken me weeks to convince them that even though we weren't tied by blood we were still a family unit. I looked over at the table next to my untidy bed and groaned at the documents that I still had to read before our meeting at 7.  I sat back down and began but I couldn't shake my thoughts about Harper. Harper's mood was usually a pleasant one but I could tell it was a cover for all the pain he had felt in his life. His quick wit and well-placed quips were his exaggerated way of telling everyone not to worry, His way of saying 'look at me, I can make jokes even in the most desperate of situations…I'm fine see?' Unfortunately it back fired and I had been feeling more and more concerned for my manic engineer. The more joy he exuded the more I felt like he was hiding and the joy he was exhibiting today only made my skin crawl. One of these days Harper's not going to be able to hide his pain behind a witty remark. One of these days he's going to explode and take us all down with him. I sipped my coffee and shook my thoughts of Harper's mental collapse away and focused on the documents in front of me. This was very important for the future of the commonwealth. This world had let out a beacon a few months ago announcing their willingness to listen and maybe allie with another world for trade purposes. Unfortunately the commonwealth wasn't the only ones to receive the message. This meeting at 7 will be a fight between me and the Drago Katsov pride who answered the beacon as well. The Than had heard the beacon and agreed to send a representative to listen to the debate and report back but they have put me in charge of speaking on their behalf. Their faith in the commonwealth was flattering but only gave me more work to do, having to learn Than legislature. I was happy that they decided to let the commonwealth speak for them in a way because of their tight family structure which would prove that the commonwealth could work with a people who have a society structured around family units. I knew that would give us a big one up.  Our only real obstacle was making sure that this planet… doesn't fall into the hands of the Drago Katsov pride. I knew they would use the materials the Rollan people had to terrorize this system and then later terrorize the very world they gotten the materials from.  The Drago's &quot;family unit&quot; was in the room next to ours, which was why Harper spent the least amount of time possible in the building and why Tyr slept with a knife. I shuddered to think of what they would do to this beautiful piece of heaven and I was tempted to bring a weapon along as well but violence is strictly prohibited on this world and would be the fastest way to get kicked out of the alie running leaving the Drago's to win The Rollan's favor by default. These diplomatic proceedings would require finesse and cunning, something I know I posses but it's also something I know Tyr possesses and was pretty damn good at it. Tyr sauntered over, holding his belt and pushing his hair out of his face like usual. He sat in front of me propping his feet on the table and pulling out a book leisurely.<br>
<br>
&quot;I assume your thinking about how you're going to handle the Drago Katsov.&quot; He said smoothly, turning the page of his book that looked humorously small compared to his bulk. <br>
<br>
&quot;Actually I was thinking about you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that so?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yep. I was thinking about how your gonna help me in the proceedings today at 7.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, and how will I be helping you?&quot; Tyr said with and aire of amusment in his voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm thinking you can help me understand how the Neitzchean mind works.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How the Neitzchean mind works? All this time I thought you knew. Evidently you've been blowing hot air.&quot; Tyr said chuckling and closing his book with an anticipation for an answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tyr. All I need is your council. If you think they are being shifty then you tell me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They are Nietzcheans…they are always shifty.&quot; He said seeming to be tired of our talk now. He shifted with boredom in his seat.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I understand what you mean and I can do that for you but what will I get in return?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Piece of mind knowing that you helped to stop the Drago Katsov from taking this world?&quot; Tyr shook his head slowly never tearing his stern brown eyes away from mine. <br>
<br>
&quot;hmmm…not good huh? Well, I could…I don't know…Give you access to a slipfighter so you can go off in search of whatever you've been asking Beka to borrow the Maru to find.&quot; Tyr raised his book and leaned back haughtily. <br>
<br>
&quot;That'll do.&quot; He said nonchalantly but I knew he was pleased.<br>
<br>
&quot;I smiled and stared down at the papers again. Tyr was making me a little uneasy but no more then usual. He was always scheming and I had no idea what his next plan was. I caught myself comparing Tyr to Rhade…I was trying to see if All the signs in Rhade that I'd missed I could find in Tyr before he back stabbed me. Just then Harper and Trance came bursting in and a groan came from Beka. Harper tracked in dirt and grass. His hair was matted to his head from sweat and the knees of his red cargo pants were stained green but he didn't seem to care. The smile on his face was huge and he ran in huffing and exhausted. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey guys look out the window!&quot; He shouted pointing with one hand while the other was holding his chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's going on?&quot; I said. Seeing Harper bent over in exhaustion shouting about looking out the window scared me. I expected to see the Drago chasing behind him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just look out the window. Snow!&quot; Beka rolled over intrigued and Tyr lowered his book reluctantly. I gazed out the window and gasped in awe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Snow?&quot; I said. Harper looked pleased with all of our reactions. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's weird cause it was so sunny a minuet ago and then out of the blue snow started coming down!&quot; Trance said sitting on her bed and hugging her pillow with excitement. <br>
<br>
&quot;Harper said that it use to snow on earth…It's cold! And it's pretty!&quot; Harper and Trance smiled at each other and Beka got up to stand beside me at the window. The temperature outside was starting to drop And the huge flakes whirled around mindlessly. Trance piped in again and her childlike excitement even made me excited.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper says that it might not stick though cause the ground is to hot.&quot; She frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;But if it keep up for long enough it might stick and we can drink hot chocolate and bundle up in our blankets and later he'll show us how to make a snowman!&quot; Tyr finally growled obviously tired of Trance's outbursts of joy.<br>
<br>
&quot;A snowman?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah! It's a man made out of snow and you have to find him a hat and scarf and use buttons for eyes and a mouth and a carrot for a nose and then you….&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, obviously some of use have forgotten the reason why we are here.&quot; Tyr said draining the room of all it's fun. He stared at all of us with his lips tight and his brow furrowed. Then he shifted angrily and returned to his book.  Harper sighed heavily and walked over to Trance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don’t' worry I'll still teach you even if Tyr wants to be a big grouch.&quot; Harper said getting no response from Tyr. Trance nodded and ran to the balcony where she danced in the falling flurries. Harper soon followed and reluctantly I stepped out into the bizarre white flakes that were falling all around. I looked up and they seemed to be falling from nowhere. I was amazed and held out my hand to catch them and watch them melt. Beka stepped out with her hands wrapped around herself. She shivered slightly at the cold air that was taking over all the heat at an astonishing rate. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've never seen snow before. I've heard of it once though.&quot; She said smiling slightly. It was a major difference from the way she looked before, screaming for Harper to shut up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Neither have I&quot; I said. I watched Harper lean over the balcony with his eyes closed. The snowflakes landed in his hair and on his lashes. He seemed to be in heaven and I smiled at him. I remembered I had the meeting to get ready for at 7 but it wasn't everyday that I got to see snow…and it wasn't every day that I got to see my engineer this content with life. No whining, no witty remark, no pessimism or fear. He looked back at me and smiled lazily and we just stared at each other…<br>
<br>
&quot;Snow.&quot; He mouthed to me and I nodded. His content was good to see but it also hurt. I knew he wouldn't stay that happy for long. I knew when the snow was gone…when we had to leave this planet that smile would vanish and the superficial lopsided smile the crew had gotten use to would return. I shivered harshly once the cold reached my bones and looked around to see everyone even Tyr being affected by the cold.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you should come in unless you want to die of pneumonia.&quot; Tyr said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh wow Tyr didn't know you cared. I'm touched.&quot; Beka said looking back into the room at the bored neitzchean.<br>
<br>
&quot;You getting sick would only delay the diplomatic proceedings hence making my stay on this…&quot; He looked out the window at the gradually increasing snow flurries.<br>
<br>
&quot;…Unpredictable planet longer then it should be.&quot; He returned to his book and Beka scoffed stepping inside and shaking the flakes out of her hair and onto a very angry Tyr. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oops…I'm so unpredictable.&quot; She said strutting to the bathroom. Tyr growled angrily and attempted to get up but I grabbed his shoulder. <br>
<br>
&quot;A family unit remember…&quot; Tyr brushed my hand off and continued to move so I had to try another tactic.<br>
<br>
&quot;slipfighter….&quot; Tyr looked at me breathed out heavily and then sat back down and returned to his book. I looked back outside and watched Harper stick his tongue out and catch the white flurries. Trance watched next to me and whispered to me…<br>
<br>
&quot;I think this is good for him. He needed this.&quot; She smiled and hopped off to her closet to choose what multicolored outfit she would wear today. I sat down to focus on the papers in front of me but I caught myself looking around Tyr to watch Harper. Who would have thought A sunny day and a Snowy afternoon could do so much for that man... The boy, kid, hell I didn't know his age but it's done a lot. I tore myself away from him and back to the documents screaming for attention. Maybe I would have a talk with Harper after the meeting…<br>
<br>
To Be Continued...<br>
<br>
I know I have another story to work on but with all the snow we got a couple of days ago I couldn't help but write a story about it. Don't worry though I havn't forgotten about the other one.<br>
<br>
Tell me what you think about this one? <br>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Tyr: Where is he?<br>
<br>
Harper: I'm sorry captain Hunt has stepped away from his desk.

Me and Tyr were fully dressed watching Beka, Harper and Trance get dressed in a rushed fury. Harper scurried around the room on his short little legs looking for his left shoe while Beka struggled to manage her hair. Trance was still trying to figure out what to wear much to everyone’s aggravation, Everyone except Harper. It was amazing watching those two interact. If it had been anyone else taking that long to choose an outfit Harper would have blown up but he had the patience of Job when it came to Trance.<br>
<br>
“Harper how about this one?” Trance said holding up an outfit that looked almost identical to the others she had pulled out for Harper's inspection.<br>
<br>
“You look sparkly and hot in all of your outfits Trance. Especially that one.” He said she smiled and skipped to the bathroom to put it on. I walked over and grabbed Harper's shoulder.<br>
<br>
“You’re a good man Harper.”<br>
<br>
“Well, I try.” He smiled finally finding his shoe and slipping it on. He smiled proudly.<br>
<br>
“Ta Da…the Harper is smooth…” He said reaching up to adjust the tie that wasn’t there.<br>
<br>
“Crap” he said with a tired frown and started searching again. I rolled my eyes and Tyr growled.<br>
<br>
“I need some air.” He said with frustration and left the room. I was thinking about leaving with him but I knew Harper would probably stop looking, pull out a sparky and go to sleep if I didn’t keep my eye on him. He finally found his tie under the bed and struggled to put it on…I walked up behind him without thinking and started to adjust his tie but he wrenched away from me much to my surprise. He whirled around and his blue pools fell into this endearing doe-like, child-like, puppy dog-like look that made my stomach drop.<br>
<br>
“I can do it Dylan.” He said angrily. Before I could say anything Beka walked in looking absolutely beautiful. She smiled brightly showing all her teeth..<br>
<br>
“You don’t have to say it …I know.” She said full of conceit. I rolled my eyes but she did look damn good. She wore a fitting blue dress that was cut too low for a function like this but I’d be damned if I were to complain. <br>
<br>
“Oh Beka! Dance! Too much booty in the pants. dance! Too much booty in the pants…” he sung loudly and Beka turned around shaking her quite shapely butt lively. I blushed and scratched my head in disbelief. Hmmm a booty shaking first officer? Suddenly I got an image of my former first officer shaking his butt in her place. I stifled a laugh and then a bone rattling shudder. I looked over to watched Harper laugh enthusiastically singing the song with all his heart and clapping in time. I wished that I could have a relationship that close. As close as Harper was to Trance and beka, having had lost my family and everyone I had ever known 300 years ago I felt isolated and lonely. Being the captain prohibited me from being that close because when push comes to shove I would make the decisions that could cost them there lives. Beka hiked up her skirt dipping down a few times which only made Harper cheer louder. Trance poked her head out of the bathroom and clapped the rhythm. They were an amazing family unit the three of them. They fought one minute and had moments like these the next. I wished that I could somehow weasel my way into there family, some how become there adopted child but they all held me at arms length. Especially Harper, I couldn't understand why he was so leery of me. Always trying to get away from me, sneaking out of rooms and finding things to do during off time. Now that I think about me and Harper have never really talked. I saw him wrench away angrily in my mind. Why was I even trying to fix his tie? Why did I even think that was appropriate? Was it because I thought of him as a son? All of a sudden all of my inner turmoil made me recent there happyness, especially Harper's.<br>
<br>
“Alright, alright…we’ve got a meeting to get to.” I said. I was being a little petty…well very petty but my excuse was that we really did have a meeting to get to.<br>
<br>
“Party pooper” Harper said doing the finishing touches to his tie. I was a party pooper. I think mainly it was because Harper's singing was hurting my ears and I couldn't get the image of Rhade shaking his butt singing 'dance to much booty in the pants'. I shuddered openly which got everyones attention.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dylan are you ok?&quot; Beka said adjusting her dress so even more cleavage was showing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah just …Don't ask. Are we ready to go?&quot;<br>
<br>
“I told you I can do it.” Harper said nodding in satisfaction. The tie was crooked and wrinkled but I didn’t say anything. I just nodded and started for the door. Trance walked out the bathroom looking stunning as usual. Harper held out his arm and Trance hooked hers with his. She giggled which only made harpers smile grow. Then an unfamiliar and distant look swept over his face.<br>
<br>
“You know I was always told never to second guess a good thing. But doesn’t it just seem like we are having too much fun and things are just going to well?” Harper said looking around the room at the luxuries then looking down at his clothes. <br>
<br>
“Something has to come along to ruin…” Harper said and I could see his good mood slipping away.<br>
<br>
“Harper stop…Just have fun ok?” Trance said with a frown that grew into a smile. I could tell she was encouraging him to smile with her which didn’t work very well. Was this the end of jovial Harper? It looked like it sadly. His mood changed so quickly it was amazing. How does he function like this? Trance straightened his tie and continued to smile hoping he’d pick it up…maybe even try to smile himself. <br>
<br>
“After the meeting are you gonna show me how to make a snowman?” Trance continued trying to prompt a smile.<br>
<br>
“Umm…yeah probably” He said which I’ve learned meant no in Harper lingo. Trance’s smile faded a little, I guess she knew the Harper lingo too. We continued down the hall picking up Tyr along the way. The building was huge so we had a good walk ahead of us but I didn’t mind. The art and sculptors that littered the hallways were exquisite. I felt like I was in a museum. The multicolored walls were painted with colors that under normal circumstances wouldn’t match but some how did here. The huge cascading windows gave us a view of the winter wonderland outside. It had been snowing for 7 hours and there wasn't a green thing left in sight. It as like someone had taken an eraser and erased all the color leaving just the outlines. The snow was considerably high and I worried slightly about the snow but the rollan people insisted that they had provisions in place if the snow became too much. The wind blew the powdery snow into beautiful tornado like spirals. I looked back to see Harper lagging behind staring out the window, tugging at his tie uncomfortably. His face was neutral but he seemed extremly subdued. Like he was on some sort of drug.<br>
<br>
“Hey Tyr, love the outfit…it’s sorta says ‘I’m dignified but I’ll still cut you’.” Beka said looking at his suit and the holster holding his knife that was strapped to his thigh. I hadn’t noticed it, it was hidden by his coat but slightly visible when he took a step. Tyr growled at Beka and looked at me. <br>
<br>
“I am not entering a room with the Drago Katsov without some means to defend myself.” He said sternly.  He crossed his arms and tightened his lips.<br>
<br>
“Tyr, you know there are no weapons allowed in the diplomatic chamber.” I held out my hand and he growled fiercly and then looked away. <br>
<br>
“Do I really have to say it?” I said a little frustrated. Tyr knew the rules and we had already discussed our deal. If he helps me out and doesn’t beat anyone up he can have a slipfighter.<br>
<br>
“Fine, but when we all die I’ll be sure to say I told you so with my last dieing breath.” Tyr shoved the knife in my hand and walked off angrily. I sighed and Beka walked up beside me.<br>
<br>
“You know he’s right. If the Drago Katsov find a way to smuggle in a weapon we are all toast.”<br>
<br>
&quot;If you think Tyr was right then why did you tell on him?&quot; I said a little confused. I was happy she told me but it wasn't her style to snitch.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ha…If I can't bring a weapon in then he can't&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; She said when she saw the dumbfounded look I gave her. and I thought I was petty...<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey that's only fair. But he was still right for wanting to bring in a weapon…no one is more conniving then the Drago.&quot;<br>
<br>
“I know don't worry like always I have a plan.” I walked off leaving Beka wondering. I so enjoyed doing that. <br>
<br>
We finally made it to the chamber and I walked up to see a very tense Tyr, quietly standing next to the door. He breathed in deeply and then turned to me reluctantly. <br>
<br>
“Metal detector…” He said promptly reaching into his jacket and pulling out another knife. Then he reached around to the back of his pants and pulled out a mini gun and lastly he lifted up his pant leg and pulled out a knife and another mini gun strapped to his leg. He put them all in my hands and we stared at each other. He cleared his throat…<br>
<br>
“I don’t like the Drago Katsov.” He said reluctantly and then strolled in. I looked back at Beka,Trance and Harper who was just as shocked as I was. <br>
<br>
“You can never say the man isn’t prepared.” Harper said walking in behind Tyr. He walked stiffly and awkwardly with his hands jammed deep in his pockets. I just watched him walk in looking totally out of character.  Beka walked past me strutting like usual and Trance lingered back with me. <br>
<br>
“He’ll be alright. This is just stressful with this world looking like earth before the magog and drago came. It just looks like everything is starting over again.” She took the weapons from my hand.<br>
<br>
“Just tell them I’m sick and couldn’t make it to the meeting…I’ll take these weapons back to the Andromeda so we won’t get caught with them.” Trance started to walk off with the assortment of weapons and I called after her.<br>
<br>
“Do you think I should talk to him?” I said. Not sure I should have asked her that question. Not sure if I sounded to unsure of myself or too desperate for a close friend. Why did I want Harper as a friend? Why not Tyr or Beka? Why not Trance?<br>
<br>
“That’s up to you Dylan. Just remember that Harper is Harper.” She said without turning around. She continued down the hall and her skin tone matched some parts of the walls exactly making her seem to disappear at times. Her tail drug behind her and she scurried along hoping none of the inhabitance would catch her in the hallway with weapons.. I looked back into the room and watched Harper and Beka idly chit chat. Harper stared at the table linen as if it was some priceless jewel. He picked at it randomly. I sighed and walked in which made all three of the Rollan dignitaries stand and bow in a show of respect. I bowed back and sat next to Harper at the table. He looked up at me quickly and gave me his famous lopsided grin and then looked back down at the table. The Rollan people were a peculiar looking race. They were a greenish yellow color with pale green eyes. They reminded me of green grass and I realized that there color helped them to blend into there environment. Maybe not this wintery one but the sunny one from this morning. Their voices were slightly distorted as if they were underwater. And all of there gestures and manorisims were truly alien to me. I had seen many races but they were so different in so many ways. Normal movements like nodding or waving meant nothing to them…I was prepared for this meeting to run extremely long. <br>
<br>
2 hours into the meeting all the members of my crew were getting extremely restless. Harper leaned back in his chair childishly and I squinted at him which made him wince and return to staring at the table cloth. Beka had taken 5 bathroom brakes, each one seeming to last much longer then the last. The Drago had shown up late as usually walking in with an hier of superiority. They sat across from us all 5 of them. The Than representitive, Noon, sat beside Beka watching our exchange of words intentively. She hadn't said anything the whole meeting. Harper found her interesting staring at her every now and then and then whispering to beka which made her giggle. I knew they weren't Highguard and lacked some dicipline but I knew they could do better then this.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't see why you are even listening to the commonwealth. You told them that you wanted to hear from a family unit and they send you this obviously unrelated crew of misfits.&quot; Remoir said caustically. He was the leader, the alpha, the big cheese. He sat leasurly eyeing Tyr and shaking his head disaprovingly. The tension was rising and my enternal clock was counting down to the moment when all hell was gonna break loose. Either Harper was gonna scream at the top of his lungs pulling off his tie and throwing it to the ground in a huff before storming out. Or Tyr would throw over the table and attempt to gouge Romir's eyes out in a big display of neitzchean testosteron. I imagined both senerio's and realized that sadly they were both possible.  The Rollan leader, Chakra stared at me and I realized I had missed something. He decided to speak for me obviously tired of waiting for me to get my head out of the clouds. Damn...strike one.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have spoken to Captain Dylan Hunt about this matter and he assures me that they are a family. Not all families are blood linked. Here on Rollanard It's not uncommon for a family to adopt the less fortunante&quot; Commander Chakra said. He looked over with his pale green eyes and landed on harper. I felt sorry for Harper all of a sudden, It seemed like everyone could see his weaknesses and never his strengths. Harper smiled it off waving condescendingly. I grabbed his hand before it became his infamous one finger salute. Harper might have been viewed as an &quot;inferior or unfortunant being&quot; but he wasn't inferior when it came to insults. I knew that getting Harper wound up would surely get us all in a lot of trouble. <br>
<br>
&quot;You seem preoccupied Captain Dylan Hunt. Is something the matter?&quot; Chakra said getting a sarcastic murmur from both Harper and all 5 neitzcheans.  I saw a purple glimmer in the door way and excused myself willingly.  Whispering in Harper's ear about protocol and how i'd take every sparky cola in the room and throw it out the window if he messed up this meeting I got up and left. I knew I was being hard on him and looking back I could see some dark recentment in his big blue eyes. I walked into the hallway to find Trance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for getting me out of that meeting.&quot; I said leaning heavily against the the wall.<br>
<br>
&quot;Umm. Your welcome but I don't think your going to be to happy for to much longer.&quot; She said biting her lip and rubbing her foot on the back of her other leg.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why? What's going on? <br>
<br>
&quot;Have you seen outside lately?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummm…no…The chamber doesn't have any windows.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come with me.&quot; She pulled me along and I followed without hesitation. I've learned that if there's something this little purple wonder wants to show me I'd be a damned idiot not to go.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see…I can't get to the Maru. I can't get rid of the weapons. I hid them in the room but I don’t' think that's a safe place.&quot; She said as we rounded the corner and I gasped. I couldn't see out of the windows. The snow had completely engolfed every inch of the huge 10 foot windows and we were on the second floor. I was baffled that in two hours the snow had tripled. I didn't know what to say and my first reaction was to panick and run for an exit. I was the kinda guy who had to see for himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;I asked one of the local inhabitance and he said that this happens every year and we won't be able to go anywhere for a couple of weeks. We're stuck here Dylan!&quot; Trance said tapping on the window. Suddenly the snow didn't look so beautiful to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Calm down Trance. Chakra told me that there are things in place for times like these. I'm sure there is a way to get off this planet.&quot; I said unable to tear my eyes away from what I had at one point thought was amazing. All of a sudden I hated snow…<br>
<br>
