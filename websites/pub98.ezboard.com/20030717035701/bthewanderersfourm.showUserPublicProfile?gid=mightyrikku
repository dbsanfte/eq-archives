I am a huge fan of Final Fantasy (mainly 10) and I am Rikku's look-alike.  Now if only I had cool swirly looking eyes...Oh well.  I am an active roleplayer, whether it be humans, lions, wolves, or anything else you want to throw out at me.  Unless you are a dumbass roleplayer who puts, "Hi WATS ^" she said.  Now that is a lamo Roleplay and I probably won't respond unless out of sympathy.  As some of you may know, I am a HUGE Lord of the Rings fan.  I have been since I was 4.  So don't go talking to me about the movies if you haven't read the books.  I hate that.  Read the books first.  I have read them like a million times along with The Hobbit and The Silmarillion.  I am a diehard Tolkien fan, so don't go accusing me otherwise.  I will come to your house and decapitate you if you do.  Muahahahahaa.  Anyway, I am also a big Anime fan.  My favourites are Rurouni Kenshin, Trigun, X, Cowboy Bebop, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Nightwalkers is pretty cool too.  I've seen a lot of them, so there is possibly no way that you would want to sit here and read them all, so I won't put them.  Also, Nicolas D. Wolfwood and Kenshin Himora are mine.  You may not have them.  I claim them as my property.  And another thing that I have really gotten into is drawing anime.  I have like three or four characters already.  After I draw a picture of my friends Mark and Brittany, I may be drawing my own little anime type story thing.  Yeah, that would be really cool.  And if I ever get my scanner, I will get them on the internet and such and show off my anime drawing abilities, which have much room for improvement in shading.  I never did like that much.  Well, if you want to know anymore about me, get away from me dumbass, you're probably a stalker.  But if you are my friend on one of the boards feel free to PM me.  I'd love to talk to you.  Well, I've got to stop typing now, so bye!</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="mailto:frodo_baggins_fan@hotmail.com">frodo_baggins_fan@hotmail.com</a></span> </div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">MSN - lorrie688@hotmail.com</span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="http://fanart.lionking.org/imgarchive/?FanArt/Mighty+hi+++" target="_blank">My Art Archive</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 		 		<span class="privatevalue">private</span>						</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
