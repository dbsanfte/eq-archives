We arent rich by any means, but someway we always have enough to buy diapers, food.<br>
<br>
For a period of time after our 1st dd was born, we used our tithing money for other things for about a year (blame it on a momentary lack of faith, I guess) but we got so far in debt in that year, that it took us almost 4 years after we started paying our tithing again to get out of those debts.<br>
<br>
You show those sad pictures.... I served my mission in Costa Rica in some very poor areas.  I saw peoples lives change for the better after they accepted the gospel and lived the law of Tithing.  In all my years being in the church I have never once heard ANYONE say you know I paid my tithing and things have really just gotten worse, but I hear all the time.  We paid our tithing and these are the blessings we have received....<br>
<br>
Maybe the blessing is being prompted to buy extra meat one shopping trip or maybe it is finding a job right away after loosing another, maybe its an old beat up car getting better gas mileage than it should physically be capable of.  Myabe it is the Bishop being impressed to come over to their house and talk to them when things were getting tight and he offers help..All sorts of ways for simple blessings.<br>
<br>
I know that God doesnt need my money, but he asks for my obedience and promises blessings if I do.   I also know that no one is getting rich off of it.  We have a lay ministry.  The money builds temples and churches and helps cover the costs of missions and humanitarian efforts. It pays for 3 Universities and some church owned elementry and high schools in some less fortunate countries.  It covers the cost of maintaining all the buildings lights power heat etc.  The LDS is a &quot;wealthy church&quot; but its money is turned right around and blesses the lives of church members and needy people across the world.  We even have a perpetual education fund, where  young people who are less fortunate or in  3rd world countries can get college or technical training to better there lives.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bad things still happen to good people: cancer, death of a spouse, problems with the economy, but I know what I have experienced and from my experience I know that paying my tithing and putting God first only blesses my life.  I know this will be hard for the skeptic to believe, but the simple fact is I have done it both ways and  I know from my experience that &quot;it works&quot;   I challenged my 16-18 yo in sunday school to give it a 6 month trial and see for themselves.  I havent had anyone come back to me telling me they tried it and were not blessed for it.<br>

Well golly--with all the empirical data and objective hard evidence here how can any of us deny the power of tithing...all good things that happen after we give god our money are because of him and all bad things are simply because, &quot;Bad things still happen to good people: cancer, death of a spouse, problems with the economy...&quot;<br>

Shirene, isn't this more appropriate for the xian section of this board? You are clearly unprepared to engage in serious intellectual dialogue here or produce a convincing argument, proof or evidence of your claim that giving the church $=blessings so what's the deal??<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Proving a theory by trial and error is actually quite scientific.  You develop your theory ( or take one someone else has developed) put the principles of the theory to the test and if they succeed and are reproducible then it eventually becomes a given.<br>
<br>
Theory - paying a full tithing brings the blessing of always having 'enough'.  Millions have tried it, and found that theory is correct.  It is reproducible.... -- Shirene<br>
<br>
As far as assigning blame for the bad things that happen -- the two dont correlate.  Every blessing is based on a law.  You live the law, you get the blessing.  No one is promised that life is going to be pain free, as a matter of fact we are promised just the opposite, that this life IS a time to learn and you only learn through trial and experience.  <br>
<br>
But the promise is given that the Lord will be there to bear your burdens with you based on the law - you have to ask and have faith. -- Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 340<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/15/03 10:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=232.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The blessings of idiocy</span><hr size=1> I prefer to cut out the middle man.  Who needs a church to manage my money when I can give straight to the charity of my choice?  (BTW <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dr's w/o Borders</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is an AWESOME org!)  Evrery year we give to a charity in my siblings names for their holiday gifts.  They get all the harassing mail and follow-up calls, I get to make that $100 gift matter more than some unneeded slacks or thoughtless gift certificate.  If the bishop wasn't hoarding my money to give to other congregants who cannot manage their money as well, raking off his share for his food and cars and houses and wives, then so much more actually goes to the starving kids or aids research.  <br>
<br>
Human's are pattern-seeking organisms.  You will find a pattern where you want to make one up.  Just like you read a horoscope written for 35 million people and fit the lines to your life (amazing isn't it?) so too you tithe and race around looking for the 'good' that will befall you.  Compromising on things like finding extra change in the dryer or celebrating that the wreck that totalled your car 'miraculously' spared your life (totally disregarding the guardrail's, airbag's and seatbelt's contributions!)  Just the same, when you guiltily fail to tithe, you sulk around morbily awaiting the wrathful hand of god who manifests in the dropped icecream cone or run in the nylons.<br>

Different than tithing.  Not saying that there hasnt been a dishonest bishop or two, but I would say that 99% are on the up and up.  Tithing and fast offerings are counted by 2-4 men, then deposited in either the general church account (tithing) or the fast offering (local account)<br>
<br>
Bishops arent paid. Stake Presdients arent paid.  General Authorities have their travel expenses paid  for conferences all over the world, but most the time they stay in the homes of members where ever they are going to reduce costs.   I *think* if they dont have enough money on their own to live when they are called  they are given some living allowances But a good deal are older and already have retirement or other income -- The one GA I personally know is a retired Lawyer and isnt lacking for money.  He doesnt need any living allowances.   <br>
<br>
If a person wants to donate to the Humanitarian fund or the perpetual education fund you can do that directly, all of the money is used for those purposes.  Each ward and Stake and all the general accounts are audited annually the general ones are done by an outside accounting firm. - Shirene<br>
