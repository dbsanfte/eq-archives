Does it also apply to small, private companies that do not receive any public funds?<br>
<br>
My husband has his own small IT consulting business, with about 50 clients here in town.  His largest client, which accounts for about 20% of his business, is run bun a man I used to work for (at a different company) - a born again Christian.  He mainly hires people from his church. . . but, occasionally, when he can't fill a position with a church member for whatever reason, he'll run an ad and hire whoever.  <br>
<br>
My dh has done work for this guy for years now, since the company was first started.  Over the years of fixing his email, etc., he's seen things like emails from one GM to another with the subject:  &quot;Should we allow non-Christains on the board of directors?&quot;  or, &quot;Don't forget!  Prayer Meeting at lunch time in the conference room!&quot;  None of this affects him, because he's a private consultant, and Bill (the owner) has only ever attempted to witness to him once.<br>
<br>
Recently, though, one of the few non-xian employees began complaining of religious discrimination -- saying (in my opinion, rightfully) that pushing these prayer meetings was inappropriate, because, even if they are not mandatory, it puts him at a professional disadvantage to refuse. A few days after he filed a formal complaint, he was fired.  Another non-xian employee quit, because a promotion that was promised to him went to a church-member who knew nothing about the business and has proven a liability to the company. <br>
<br>
Plus, I guess Bill &quot;recommends&quot; reading material like &quot;Business by the Book,&quot; (as in the &quot;good&quot; book), and holds &quot;family value&quot; meetings which he somehow attempts to tie into his business.<br>
<br>
Like I said, this doesn't affect my husband. . . but I'm curious as to whether or not any of the other non-religious employees might sucessfully litigate the matter<br>
<br>
Any thoughts?<br>

<br>
Anyway...here there isn't anything you can do about that kind of thing, as far as I know...if they were discriminating against a muslim, or a mormon or someone then that would be different....but (at least here), a prayer meeting isn't discrimination as such. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.growthspurts.com/drivee/images/434360233606.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=minusrusty>minusRusty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/5/03 1:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=145.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   If I recall correctly, ...</span><hr size=1> ...there is a minimum company size that applies. Something like 15 employees or fewer don't fall under anti-discrimination litigation.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what the business requirements are, but if the company in any way crosses state boundries to do business or accepts federal money, then the probability that they have to follow Federal Regs greatly increases.<br>
<br>
Not much help, I'm afraid. I'd contact the ACLU or a lawyer.<br>

So if there are more than 25 employees - the owner is an employer under the Act.  Unless he does business across state lines then it falls under (b) above.<br>

That can largely impact decisions made, remedies available, and case law.  <br>
<br>
There are lots of religous descrimination cases, but they tend to follow a 'protected class' standard and unfortunately, atheists are not a protected class.  (Like a racism case filed by a caucasian would find little support in the law because they are not a protected class.)  If any were women or minorities they enjoy a greater degree of protection.  Now, aside from the religion, there are grounds for action based on wrongful termination, and harassment in an opressive workplace, and this environment may qualify.  To survive initial trial motions (to dismiss or strike) there must be a prima facia showing of a pattern of behavior and intent on the employers part (or agents thereof.)<br>
<br>
Let me know the state and I can pull some actual cases for you.<br>

I'm concerned that the size of the company might be a sticking point:  though there are certainly more than 15 employees in the office, he has it structured so that there are five or six different companies, and different employees technically work for different &quot;companies.&quot;  Would he be able to claim exemption based on that fact, or would the fact that he owns all the companies and runs them out of the same office come into play?<br>
<br>
I really appreciate your help.<br>

<br>
Thinking on my feet here - They all work in the same office, and all companies and their employees are expected to attend these prayer meetings hosted by the employer without any distinction to which 'company' they work for.<br>
<br>
I don't think it would be hard for a good lawyer to argue that because of the office situation, that the employee number should be based upon those working there and not the number working for each individual company. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=145.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=145.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=145.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=145.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.threadControl?topicID=145.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=145.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=145.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="religiousdebate60574frm2">Debate Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm10">Christianity Discussions (G Rated)<option value="religiousdebate60574frm1">Announcements<option value="religiousdebate60574frm11">Test Forum<option value="religiousdebate60574frm5">Help Files</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574>religiousdebate</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2>Debate Forum</a> <font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
