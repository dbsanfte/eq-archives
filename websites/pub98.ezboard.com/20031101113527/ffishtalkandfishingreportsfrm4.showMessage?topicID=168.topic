I'll tell you when.  Whenever you have a chance to fish with Team9nine (Brian Waldman).  I must say that after arriving at Brian's house in the morning.  He was an absolute gentleman, and quite sharp on his fishing knowledge of lakes and equipment.  We spent the first 45 minutes or so just admiring what each other used, and the styles that have produced best for each of us.  <br>
<br>
Let me tell you after that long haul there I was quite exhausted, and didn't feel like driving too much more.  So we decided to hit some ponds around Team9nine's house and do some RockHopping.  What a blast that was, there was just slight drizzle when we started, and then the sun came out a little towards the end.  The bite may have tailed off just a little, but we were able to catch fish throughout the day.  We each took a couple rods with different set ups.  Brian brought along his buzzbait, and a Zara Spook.  I haven't seen a real good topwater bite this year, so it was fun watching Brian get some hits on the Zara spook.  Plus it was fun watching him work it.  I've never worked mine that way before, and will have to do some practicing to get it down.  Meanwhile the fish were extremely cooperative in the ponds.  We caught some 3's, a couple pushing 4, and one toad that was probably 6 lbs. plus.  Most of the bass were relating to drainage ditches or shoreline cover.  Brian was quite the gentleman with giving me the first shot at many areas.  Doubling back over the same spots was also productive.  We caught a few more going in the opposite direction including the big one.  <br>
<br>
I also received a lesson on Spotted bass.  One pond that were fishing Brian hooked into a spotted bass (which I've never seen in person).  Brian was so kind to point out the characteristics of the fish that made it a spotted bass (stripes, mouth, and rough spot inside the mouth.  That was pretty cool.  The only thing I wished, was that we had a little more time to spend on the water today.  It was very fun indeed.  <br>
Below are some of the great memories that I will take from this trip.  thanks again Brian.  P.S.  Read the small caption at the bottom.<br>

The ride home for me wasn't quite as fun as the ride there.  When I got home that evening and got out of the shower.  I noticed that my left leg was all swollen from the knee to the ankle.  I was quite concerned since there was no ankle twist or anything associated with it.  So I spent the majority of the night at the emergency room getting checked for Phlebitits.  The results ended up coming negetative, and my leg does seem to have the swelling go down some.<br>
So I'm sorry for not getting this report up a little sooner, but had me sweating bullets last night for a little while.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Brian those ponds I told you I saw on the way to your house.  Were on 69 near exit 19 by Noblesville I believe.  There were 3 of them stilled packed with anglers.  Thanks again for your fine hospitality.  I hope to return the favor in the near future. <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">
