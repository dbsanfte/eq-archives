<br>
Remember my initial review of ADDB?  I was PISSED.  I was like who the hell is this evil little purple girl with her silly mind tricks.<br>
<br>
I'm convinced that um, she has a larger purpose in mind and that her people don't give a rat's ass who they sacrifice in order to achieve their goal (which is to save the universe from being returned to a state of black holedness which is what I think Enigma would like).  Who's good and who's evil?  In the Widening Gyre Rev Bem was shown Enigma's true intentions and underneath the hate he saw love, a view that life is a disease.<br>
<br>
Hell for all we know Enigma IS the Divine and TRANCE is the demon.<br>

As the old Thomas Dolby song goes, they blinded me with science...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The truth is that this is as good as it's going to get for Drom - Zack &amp; Ashley write an interesting story from Trance's perspective. The ailien is no worse than any other we've been getting (and probably better than anything coming in Season 4), and so I'm determined to enjoy what's left of something that mostly resembles Old Drom, before we lose the last of the writers who knew what Drom was supposed to be.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I will agree the alien is no worse than any other we've been getting. Hence my low rating of this episode. Just seeing that guy in the promo commercial (which they always air immediately before the ep for some reason in my area) was a downer.<br>

<br>
I don't blame you for being confused. A writer on the official board confirmed this is the crew added from the Bellerophon from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Lone and Level Sands.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> But when I asked why they are still on board, when they mutinied for the purpose of getting to earth, he had no answer. Imagine if you mutiny from the only captain you know, to return to earth. Would you be satisfied spending the next couple years on the Andromeda Ascendant, participating in dippy adventures like this? Let me off at earth! (chuckle)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Plus, they were actually mentioned. Anyway, I never watched TOS but Trekkies I know say they also had nameless crew extras whose job it was to get killed and all.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Prior to this season, the ship had nothing but robot drones as crew. This human crew has appeared and disappeared because they've admitted they just didn't have the budget to show other people. That's why we see the command staff like Harper and Beka setting maggot traps around the ship, and endless scenes of the command staff running through empty corridors. There were usually people in Enterprise corridors.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I do have a strong sci fi background. Not every single ep of every show has to advance a story line (not that there even IS a story line on this show anymore and that's hardly Ash and Zack's fault). But in the end in this ep something DID happen. Eventually they did encounter the creature and they defeated it. But more importantly, FINALLY we got a real glimpse of Trance and how very alien she really is.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Oh boy, what a treat to find Trance is the personification of the dreaded and reviled <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Voyager</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> reset switch. How many times have we seen Voyager viewers cite that as a major reason that series sucked ass, and they repeat it on Andromeda? What a great revelation! What character advacement! Not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Was it perfect? No. The new crew members thing has been bugging the hell out of me since it happened and I would definitely have liked to know more about the villain. But the first is a production issue over which the writers have no control and the latter is a function of the mythos behind this show having been gutted by Tribune and Fireworks. Despite that it's a well written, well acted 42 minutes of television that features the crew working together as a team and gives some much needed insight into what has hitherto been the most underdeveloped character on the show.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I saw plenty of character advancement for Trance before her tail was removed. And there was the episode she spent with the Cancer Man. This new Gold Trance is a disaster, and focusing a whole episode around that disaster doesn't improve her character.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>There is a point that I maintained over on the old SS, and it's this: Engels and whoever else in charge is actually trying to manage a story arc this season, but they're being so murky and obtuse about it that its almost impossible to see.

<br>
I would certainly agree with that, Bob Engels obviously had a grand story in mind with the season premiere he wrote. The problem is that it was a prime example of how bad his story arc was going to be. And so far, the season has lived down to the expectations set by the cataclysmically-bad season premiere. He has a story arc, but it either barely gets to screen, or is deliberately written this badly. Not a good set of choices.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That being said, TDB actually explained a lot of things about the show...things stretching back all the way to S1. I smell RHWs genius at work here; TPTB have taken the hidden concepts of Trance and put them to work in this ep, I believe.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Hey, fine by me. But there should be a sharp limitation on her ability, maybe some artifact (they've got two of those now, don't know) that gives her the power, and then is destroyed when she settles on a new timeline. What Trance is, she's not science fiction, and she's not even fantasy. Trance is in the third category of stinky writing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The crux of this ep is the old argument of Free Will vs. Fate. Even Dylan stops to reflect on it, commenting that choices belong to us, the rest is fate. That statement sidesteps the whole debate: do we have Free Will in our lives, or are we at the mercy of a predetermined schedule of events and suffering under the illusion that we have some control? Here, Trance is portrayed as outside of all events manipulating them...because she is driving Dylan Hunt to the &quot;one perfect possible future.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This was crawling around somewhere in the back of Bob Engels' mind, too bad he couldn't have presented the question in a more coherent manner. I try not to confuse bad writing with deep writing, and I believe Bob turned in the former.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Why Dylan? Uh...besides the fact that Kevin Sorbo has top billing, it's already been shown that Hunt is the one to &quot;lead our armies in the battle to come&quot; whatever that cryptic shit means.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Well when they did this episode on Star Trek, Data was the one who saved the ship, and he did it by focusing on an utterly insignificant detail. Bob Engels could just as easily have had anyone else on the command staff be the key, but Dylan has to be number one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Was one of the original concepts of the show an Armageddon-like battle between the Authors of Creation and the Spirit of the Abyss (no, not Lil...the OTHER Spirit Of The Abyss...)??? Or is this a recent invention of TPTB? Is Trance an agent of Creation? It's been speculated that she is the spirit of a sun, but would a sun have the physical properties allowing it to mull over multiple futures? A black hole would, since time stops on its edge...is Trance a rogue black hole? Perhaps the one that originally trapped Dylan? Nahhh.....</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Since I was planning to be fascinated by the forming of the Commonwealth, the role of the Nietzchians, the role of the original founding Vedrans, and the role of the Magog, I am at a total and complete loss as to how to take this season. It has nothing to do with any of those things, and it's not even remotely interesting.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>TDB, like many eps this season, was ripe with potential, and used more of that potential than others, but dropped the ball on so many things...usually little things. As Ogami pointed out, the bad guy looks like Darth Vader, or more like Sauron IMHO. The Ninja security guys hiding behind Tyr needed to stay at home if that's the best they could do. Also, as our thread author pointed out, the rewind sequences got a little tiresome, and as in &quot;Cause &amp; Effect&quot; should have been shot from different angles each time.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Actually I had a small re-enactment of what Trance did this episode. I saw a disaster unfold, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I rewound the tape,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> then I taped <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Alias</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> over it.

This is laughable, imagine if the script calls for Tyr to be attacked by 5 Niets, and they need to have his security squad there. This means Tyr will have 2 buddies, and 3 attackers. (Or it could just be the same two guys with rapid camera shots.)<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure Doctor Who had the lowest budget of any major scifi series, and even they didn't look this bad.<br>

And how many episodes this season have I or other reviewers had to put up with the disclaimer that the writers didn't intend this or that to happen, they have no control over editing, shooting, blah blah blah. I can't go by that, I can only go by what's onscreen. <br>

Maybe he watched the Babylon5 episode where the Narn battlecruisers were attempting to flee through jumppoints, and the Shadow vessels fired disruptions at the tunnels, collapsing them.<br>

Isn't that something of an oxymoron HF?  <br>
<br>
I'm watching the ep thinking, &quot;No wonder Dylan calls Trance his good luck charm.&quot;  Did I or any of my crew mess up that situation?  No problem, Trance will do her Groundhog Day magic until we get it right.  She may have to senselessly murder several bonsai trees in the process; but Trance will provide us with the opportunity to fix all of our mistakes.  She is the great spirit of the Mulligan; not so much a manipulator as a gifter of multiple chances.<br>

She's self serving in the extreme.<br>

What if one day it serves her to have one or more of the crew die?<br>

She has already shown that she would use spit and chewing gum to keep Beka running long enough to serve her needs.<br>

In fact, most of the people I've met are self serving to one degree or another.  Everyone on the Andromeda, including Andromeda herself, is self serving.  Serving others occasionally may better help them save themselves later; but they are all self serving.  They wouldn't be very believable if they weren't.  (This BTW is one of my biggest gripes with Next Generation.)  So she cares more for the people she interacts with regularly than the people she doesn't know very well or doesn't know at all; last time I checked that characteristic was also true of most people.  Yeah, it bugged me that lots of nameless crew deaths were preferable to her than losing one of the command staff; but I think that kind of choice often gets made in conflict.  Hate Trance if you want but don't bs yourself into believing she is any more manipulative than anyone else on the crew.  <br>

To me it's enough that her make-up make me want to heave. And what a joke that hairstyle is, does she ever let her hair down? Beka and Rommie change hair styles every week, yet weird Trance still has those knots in her wig.<br>

I remember when we could see Laurie Bertram's hair, now she wears a welcome mat headress that looks to weigh about 40 pounds.<br>
