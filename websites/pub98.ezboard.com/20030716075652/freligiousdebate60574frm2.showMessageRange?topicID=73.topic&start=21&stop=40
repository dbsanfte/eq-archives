That sounds pretty subjective, if we're talking about being scientific and all. Wouldn't a &quot;pure&quot; scientist consider each hypothesis independently based on its quantitative merits?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> How can you have a quantitative merit if it isn’t in consideration of your entire body of knowledge?  You cannot just forget what gravity is when examining continental drift and plate tectonics.  You cannot ignore rules of convection and thermodynamics.  All of your hypotheses are based in consideration of your entire body of knowledge.  An extreme claim is one requiring more steps away from what is known to establish.  If you look at a bird and know it flies, you can reasonably postulate that some organisms fly.  If a Guru claims he can, you then consider that in light of your body of knowledge.  Birds have wings, hollow bones, weight to surface-area ratios, basic aerodynamic properties that the guru is lacking.  It is too much of a divergence from what we know properties are of flying creatures to just accept.  So we don’t accept simple testimony, we require a demonstration.  Once the demonstration has been verified we can tentatively accept that he flies, but then we need to know how and start examining what properties enable it because it is SO different from our previous experience.  We come to understand the requirements for non-avian flight and our knowledge increases and the requirements for the next guy to say he can fly are proportionately reduced.  Could we have been deceived all our lives?  Can these buildings we don’t enter really be fronts with scaffolding holding them up if we walk behind them?  Are we all hired hands and you the star of the Trueman Show?  Sure.  Only so long as you do not examine the evidence and weigh the arguments or repeat an experiment yourself.  When you drive to the city, do you see the tips of the tall buildings before you see the low ones?  Do you see the mast of a vessel before you see the body sail over the horizon?  Do you have a rope swing on a very tall tree to function as a pendulum?  You can do these experiments yourself.  Is it perfect knowledge?  No, but it is self correcting, builds on itself and revises every time we discover something new.  Any one who tells you they have perfect knowledge is after something, usually your money.  Moreover, every time I nuke my lunch, visit the dentist or log onto this site, I am using the fruits of that process and knowledge-base.  I have tactile evidence that electricity works, magnetic media can be read but not seen, and any time I need to question it I can ask my Gramma what her life was like in 1905 and verify it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I could find any of those things that purport to &quot;prove&quot; the existence of God as well (historical documents, supposed photos of miracles, out of body experiences), but I still think they're faulty (even though I believe in God).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yes, but unless that proof can withstand the critical light of examination it isn’t really proof is it?  How are we to distinguish the falsified evidence from the genuine if it isn’t examined?  Many theists are very willing to examine what goes against their beliefs quite critically, even to the point of blatantly refusing to accept it when it runs counter to their desired worldview even when they can’t disprove it.  Yet if you turn that critical light on their own shaky cardhouse of faith, they get offended and put off.  We don’t need an examination of the mundane.  I don’t need an engineering schematic to figure out how toenail clippers work.  What is being claimed is that not only is there this invisible omniscient omnipotent entity but that it judges us and rewards or punishes us on some rule set with ETERNAL consequences.  What could require more urgency of verification?  Eternal torment for some arbitrary rule set, I damn well better find out what those rules are and which entity to listen to.  I should never take for granted that the dogma I was fed as a child is any better than the dogma anyone else was fed when my immortal soul is in jeopardy.  That would be plain stupid.  If you want to claim a god created this world and everything in it, I may not be able to disprove it, I can only say the evidence does not support it.  Once you start making positive postulates about the nature of this god beyond that, I have something to test against and prove or disprove.  This is deism vs theism again.  You claim god cares about me eating shellfish or what fabrics I wear, then why did god make them?  You claim he is omniscient and omnipotent, yet why is his book so filled with factual errancy like the sky being supported or holding back waters, the world being flat or sun orbiting the earth? If he loves us and interceded for your husband when was in a car accident to keep him alive, why didn’t he break the window of that parked car those poor babies died in? The evidence is counter to the traits of the gods being claimed.  To quote my Gramma again, “Don’t pee on my leg and tell me it’s raining.”<br>
<br>
I don’t want you or anyone to accept anything I say.  Nothing should ever just be blindly taken from anyone.  I want you to read what I say and think about it yourself, then go out and experiment.  Hold your beliefs to as critical a light as you do everyone else’s.  Evidence needs to not only prove his existence, it has to refute all the evidence against it.  There is always the possibility of a third explanation we haven’t considered yet that explains all the evidence in some new undiscovered way.  If you discount Odin and Set and Shiva, why are they worse than the one you do hold?  Don’t just feel, verify.<br>

The idea of God was basically given to me by a few men living in times that are somewhat primitive compared to today.  The existence of England is something that the masses have witnessed, including many people that I personally know and trust.  Next, people's descriptions of England are pretty consistent, whereas their descriptions of God and his rules are not, hence the large number of religions.  Also, people don't really have reason to lie about England.  If Moses or Muhammed lied about their experiences, then one might say they had something to gain due to the large number of followers, and the fact that their names will go down in history forever.  People love notoriety, and I'm sure many people came to their beck and call while they were alive.  Lying about the existence of England serves no purpose other than to hide the true origin of the Beatles, lol.  England is also something that can easily be verified if skepticism ever did arise.  They have direct flights from Denver International to Heathrow, however trying to obtain a direct flight to heaven will result in a one way ticket that I'm not yet ready to buy.  <br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong here.  I'm not saying that Muhammed was lying for personal gain, or that he was too stupid to comprehend his own thought process.  I'm just saying that these are valid considerations which nobody can really confirm or deny.  Lying about England would have to be a much larger conspiracy theory than Moses lying about his conversation with God on Mount Sinai.  Moses is just one individual, whereas numerous individuals have seen England with their own eyes.  Sure, I'm guessing it is possible for England to be a figment of our imaginations, but it isn't probable.  <br>

But these are all limited to the physical world.  I'm not sure it's appropriate to try and judge the metaphysical in terms of the physical.  We haven't been able to find physical proof for things like the soul, human experience (feelings, thoughts), etc. either.  I guess the closest thing I can think of to that is the measuring of brainwaves and such.  To me it seems so mundane.  A rat in a maze learns that if he runs one way and dings the bell he gets cheese.  He has now conducted a basic experiment and has &quot;learned&quot; a rule that is factual to his existence, namely he does one action and that prompts a certain reaction.  Most of our concrete scientific research is similar, we conduct an experiment and we learn a new fact.  But what elevates us above such concreteness?  The intellect.  Our ability to use reason and logic to move beyond our base senses.  This is what Allah calls us to do in the Qur'an.  When He says (paraphrasing), &quot;Look at that tree, look at the habits of the bee, look at the vast differences in humanity, and use your intellect,&quot; He's not saying to see how pretty that flower is and know God exists.. He doesn't refer to such things as &quot;proof&quot; of His existence, rather as *signs* (&quot;ayaat&quot;) of His existence.  They are a starting point for contemplating the existence of God, but they are not proof in and of themselves.  Throughout the Qur'an it constantly commands people to use their minds and their intellect.  It's not supposed to be some blind faith; the world of science and the world of faith are not at odds, they are complimentary.<br>
<br>
&quot;You claim he is omniscient and omnipotent, yet why is his book so filled with factual errancy like the sky being supported or holding back waters, the world being flat or sun orbiting the earth? &quot;<br>
<br>
This is one of the big problems I have with this board.  I guess it should be clear to me by now that most of you are battling here with Christianity.  I have as many problems as you do with the Bible, my faith isn't based on the Bible, and I'm fairly confident that most people here have only a rudimentary familiarity with the Qur'an and Islamic thought.  Most scientists have found the Qur'an to be in harmony with scientific discovery... but I find that an apologetic topic.  A lot of Muslims get hung up with this whole &quot;scientific miracles in the Qur'an&quot;.  I'm not denying that there's a lot in there that deals with science, but this is hardly the thrust of God's message to us.<br>
<br>
You might find it interesting to read some of the works of the classical Muslim philosophers (if you haven't already).  This discussion between philosophy (meaning Greek philosophy here) and Islam has been a long one.<br>

But that's just it. There is no proof of a supernatural world and saying the type of proof we need in this does not apply to the &quot;spirit&quot; world is just silly. I can make any claim then and when asked for proof claim that all known methods don't apply to my metaphysical claim.<br>

You're on the right track here with brain waves, and yes feelings are known including what causes them, physiological reactions etc. No, there is no proof of the soul...but that's back to metaphysics isn't it?<br>

<br>
I feel &quot;signs&quot; can be subject to a lot of interpretation.  What one person might see as a sign of God's existence, another person might have a more earthly explanation for.  This doesn't make one person right and one wrong.  These signs might be valid indications of God's existence, but they also might just another logical explanation that has nothing to do with a deity.  I would think that the only thing that can be a true sign is something that has no other explanation.  For instance, if I jump off a 20 story building, but I stop in midair and float down nice and slow to safety, then I would call that a sign of a higher power because there would be no other explanation for it(assuming no funky weather patterns of course, lol).  When I look at my son, I could either say that his existence is so precious there must be higher power gifting him to me(a sign), or I could say that although he seems more spectacular to me, he is still just a product of reproduction which is a normal part of nature in all species(the earthly explanation).  One person might feel he is God's creation, and another person might feel he is science's creation.  Either way, it is subject to much interpretation.  <br>

I see what you're saying, but I don't think the analogy about leaving your teenager fits here.  The difference is that your teenager knows for certain what the rules are because you have directly told him.  If he chooses to break the rules, he has done so with the complete knowledge that he is going against you.  Not so with God--there are so many different interpretations of the rules, and nobody really knows for sure who is right.  People who believe in God cannot agree amongst themselves what the rules are--look at how religious people differ on issues like abortion, homosexuality, alcohol, divorce, birth control, Harry Potter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , baptism...I, for one, would not be adverse to the idea of the voice coming out of the clouds to clear all this up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I understand the concept of free will and letting us make our own decisions, but I don't think it would hurt to give us a little better idea of what is expected--I say this as a person who believes in God and struggles a lot with this issue.<br>

How sad that you actually believe this is your only purpose on this planet. We have gone over this many times before, but there are numerous reasons to live besides proving yourself like some teenager to a supernatural egotistical skydaddy. All that knowledge and power and all he can think to do is give life to beings whose sole purpose is to serve him and suffer here in ambiguity? What a shame not to know the freedom and joy of a life full of purpose without the shackles of servitude...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

&quot;Its like leaving your teens home for the weekend the first time to see if they will follow the rules or not. At some point in time a parent has to let go and let the child choose for themselves. This is Gods way of letting go and letting us choose for ourselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
As someone else pointed out already, this is a VERY poor analogy, and for the record I would never leave my teens home for the weekend for the sole purpose of testing or tricking them. Certainly I would not place poison or drugs on the coffee table on my way out knowing they would ingest them and suffer permanent, eternal consequences. Only a total sadistic jerk would do that and in this country he would be jailed for child neglect at best and abuse or attempted murder at worst. Shame on your god.<br>

&quot;i'll start by throwing out another theory:<br>

<br>
This is ridiculous and your drunk man doesn't even fit into your &quot;theory&quot; since his drunken state is not related to his level of intelligence. Hitler and his minions made many claims about Jews that were totally untrue, but many of these men were intellects. The problem is dag, you don't use any scientific method when coming up with these crazy theories (see mustard seed souls thread), but use the language of science to cloak your baseless claims with some sort of credibility. Wrong. Where is your research, logic, testing?<br>
<br>
&quot;my problem lies in such outrageous claims being proposed by such good people.&quot;<br>
<br>
The outrageous claims of turning water into wine, parting seas, walking on water or resurrecting dead people? Who are the &quot;good people&quot; to whom you refer? Xains? LDS? Joseph Smith?<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;back to the teacher analogy, none of this ever would have happened if only people with the reputation of &quot;bully&quot; went behind the closed door.&quot;<br>
<br>
You don't have to be a bully to be a charlatan...see Joseph Smith's life. There are fakes and frauds all over the place including television claiming to talk to dead relative of poor, hurting people in order to get ratings and get rich. <br>
<br>
&quot;but then there was the one perfect student that took the time to get to know each person and tutor them as much as they asked for help. he came back from behind the closed door and told the rest of us that this is what the teacher needs and why...&quot;<br>
<br>
There are actually several &quot;perfect students&quot; or prophets and since I'm not sure whether you are referring to Jesus or Joseph Smith (I hope Jesus, since Smith is a proven liar and fraud), I can only say your perfect student is not recognized or more trustworthy than Kate's or a Buddhists or a Pagan's. How do we know the student is perfect? Because he comes out of the door and tells us he is? Becuase he comes out of the door and tells us the teacher behind the door who we cannot see or hear told him he's perfect? Honestly, the severe lack of any logic or reason in this argument is laughable and serves only to convince me further of the refusal of your supernatural being to be clear.<br>
<br>
&quot;the explaination made sense and *felt* right to me since this particular student had always helped me before.&quot;<br>
<br>
Or was someone else helping you and you just attributed it to the &quot;perfect student&quot;? OR did you help yourself and attribute it to the &quot;perfect student&quot; since that's what your mom and dad told you to do and feel? Many have felt they lived other lives or talked to Buddha...why are your feelings proof that theirs are false? Are you more intelligent?<br>
<br>
&quot;BUT (there's always a big but) the explaination pissed off the bullies who decided to kill the perfect student so that they could continue to twist truth to their liking and take my lunch money. (dark ages)&quot;<br>
<br>
Ah yes the martyrdom of the student...only he also taught you that the second coming would be in the lifetimes of those he met and talked to. Perhaps he misunderstood his teacher's directions? <br>
<br>
&quot;i can't think of a more evil thing to do than to live a perfect life and then knowingly lie about the purpose of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
My point exactly. And how evil is it to live a &quot;perfect life&quot; (as god) and knowingly be deceptive, unclear and ambiguous to those you command to serve you. <br>
<br>
&quot;why would someone so good do something so evil? either jesus is who he says he is, or he is the most evil person to have ever walked the earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Or he was simply another fake, or he was mentally ill and deluded, or he was like many religious folk who have &quot;visions&quot; and really believe they are doing good but are just wrong and don't know it. If the latter are correct, he's not evil, just sick or misguided. Now you're god on the other hand is the most evil being in the universe if he's truly this cruel and wishy washy about such important things with eternal consequences that he creates. <br>

<br>
There are many answers to this.  I've brought up the possibility before that intellects in olden times may have confused intuitive thought with the word of a deity.  If someone lives a mundane life where the brain is required to process very little, and all of a sudden they have moments of clarity, then they aren't going to know how to describe that.  Another answer that comes to mind is that some people do unethical things for what they feel is the right reason.  If you see a group of downtrodden people practically living in anarchy with no hope, then your heart might tell you to give them hope by teaching them about a deity and an afterlife that will be better than this one.  You might be pulling the info from your behind, but you'll think you are doing the right thing because you'll be making these people happy and giving them some direction.  This is a situation where you'll need to ask yourself if the ends justify the means.  <br>
<br>
While we are on the subject of analogies, I'll throw out a weak one.  Has anyone ever seen the Music Man?  In this movie/play Professor Harold Hill makes a living selling band instruments and uniforms to townfolk, and then his plan is to take off with the money without ever really teaching their boys to play in a band.  When he gets to River City he is discovered at the end, but everyone forgives him because they looked at how the town was so happy when they had these band activities to look forward to, and there was comraderie among people because of it as well.  He brightened their lives eventhough he brightened them with a lie.  One could say the same about Jesus, Moses or Muhammed.  The people were a mess, so these prophets told them not to worry because there were great things to look forward to.  There was borderline anarchy, but these &quot;prophets&quot; gave them rules to live by.  They may have had malicious intent like Harold Hill, or they may have had the people's best interest at heart.  We may never know for sure.  Either way, these people caused a lot of confusion by claiming to deliver numerous different messages from one source.<br>

<br>
When I talk about metaphysical, I don't mean the Psychic Hotline.. I mean metaphysical in the classical sense.. concepts, feelings, what is love?  What is Beauty?  What is the guiding search of the soul?  Do we long for love, for happiness, for beauty?  What is the purpose and meaning behind life?  The use of logic and reason to determine things beyond physical comprehension.. when we talk about &quot;infinity&quot; what does that really mean?  How can we conceptualize that?  In all of the world around us, we examine it, we determine its parts, the means it came to be, and we follow it back and back, and still we do not come to the essential element, the &quot;First Mover&quot; to use the Greeks' term.  For me, whether you use in vitro, test tubes, or cloning, they are all advancements, but it still does not solve the issue of origin.  We have not yet been able to make something out of nothing.  This, to me, is the biggest issue of all.<br>

There is no genuine evidence that he ever lived aside from that rotten book.  Everything else is an unsubstantiated claim.  I can claim Constantine was a sun worshipper and you can claim he was LDS.  Then we have to turn to corroborative evidence.  The architecture of the buildings he built the assignments of wealth and station in his forces and political offices, the sanctions and blessings he imposed.  He refused to strike down the pagan groups.  He bribed those people who suited him.  He was unbaptised.  He introduced self-serving and controversial dogma in keeping with his pagan beliefs that were in conflict with the bishops that were supposed to run the church. He assigned holy days to match those of his pagan beliefs.  Evidence.  Oddly enough, JC didn’t leave as big a footprint.  Constantine made the footprint that was attributed to JC.  You may be correct in that attributing the lies that are credited to JC’s work is unjust, because at the root, we cannot prove that the lies credited to him were his actions.  We cannot even substantiate that he ever lived.  Yet if we run off that same book you use, and we concede that he lived, and we concede his significance, then yes, he is a liar and a fraud.  Take exception all you like, but you know no more than us, possibly less if you refuse the evidence and accept the unsubstantiated as facts.<br>
