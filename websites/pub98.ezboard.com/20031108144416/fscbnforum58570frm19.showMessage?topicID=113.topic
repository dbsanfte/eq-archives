For I have been drained of emotion as surely as my love has been drained of blood.  I find it hard to follow the darkness to his bed.  But I love him still and still I will tell of this month has been the hardest for us.  He left I know not where, until he returned.  After a week we waited for the man who stalked me to come again and that is when Willard told me where he had been.<br>
  He felt as if there were gaps we had not covered on our travels and he went back throw to check those out.  He journey was detained when two ghouls came to him.  They came with him with stakes and a blade.  They were bound to cut off his head.  They were acting on orders by some one.  He wanted to find out.  The first one came at him with the stake, he diverted the thrust and grabbed his opponents' hand, while in doing so he heard a snap and then saw bone.  The ghoul screamed in pain and fell to his knees. The other ghoul dropped the blade and tried to run, but Willard grabbed him, &quot;Who is you master?&quot;  he said, but the ghoul would not answer.  The next the Willard remembers is the stake plunged into his body for a week he lay in the sewers, no one knew. No one came.  But one day, a member of his clan saw him.  He pulled the stake out and said, &quot;I shouldn't be doing this.  In this place we trust none, but I have pity.  Run, back to where you are safe.  I would run too but I belong here.  I will cover your tracks.  It is not you the he seeks.  It is Sara.&quot;<br>
  Willard then stopped his story to look at me.  &quot;He knew your name.  I could let you go if that is what you wish.  Do you wish to be turned.  He wants to turn you.  You would not be the monster that I am and....&quot;<br>
  &quot;SHHH...&quot; I cued, &quot;I have but one love and that is you.  How would I know if the turning would effect my love for you?   How would I live in the absence of love?  I told you before, I would rather die.  Speak not again of the turning.  My soul can't bare the thought of the loss of love that I bear for you.  I beg you go to Steven, seek his help.  He will help us.  He has a fondness for me as I do him.  I trust him.  Please my love, I could not bear loosing you again.&quot;<br>
  &quot;You don't think I can take care of this?&quot;<br>
  &quot;I do but don't have me grieve for you as well.&quot;<br>
  I turned away and started to cry. &quot;I will not ask him, Sara but trust me, it will be handled.  I will keep you safe.&quot;<br>
  The next afternoon I received a phone call for an anonymous person to meet me next Wednesday, at dusk at one of my law firms outside of Santa Clara.  They wanted to contribute to my non-profit organization, Better Research And No Animal Test Foundation, BRANAT Foundation.  This upset me even more.  I begged again for him to seek the help of Steven.  Every day I did this until he gave in. <br>

He hated to ask for help from any one.  He knew though, the only way to make Sara happy was to do this.  He also knew that help comes with a price and this is what he feared would happen with Steven Crowley.  What did he know of this Venture?  He knew that in this city Crowley was the one to protect the masquerade.  He knew that Sara liked him.  But really only met him once.  He had never worked with him before.  As he walked through the sewers, Willard turns a corner and pulls out a utility phone.  He plugs it into a secret connection that is hidden with a small panel right about waist level.  He dials the number he needs and waits.  <br>
  &quot;Hello this is Crowley here.&quot;  he hears on the other side of the phone.<br>
  &quot;Hello Steven, we have met once.  I am Willard.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Willard, Sara's keeper.  I am glad to hear that you are back in town.  I have been protecting her through your leave of absence.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Yes she told me, which is part of the reason why I am calling you.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Really?&quot;  There was an inquisitiveness in Crowley's voice.<br>
  &quot;Yes, can we meet at Sara's house?&quot;<br>
  &quot;I will be there shortly.&quot;<br>
  Willard hung up the phone and strolled down the sewers a little bit more until he came to another hidden panel which opened into a number punch box.  Willard punched a couple numbers and the wall opened before him.  As he walked threw, the wall closed slowly.  He stood in the cellar of Sara's house.  Sara was on a Victorian styled love seat that was covered in red velvet.  She was sleeping.  Willard smiled and went over and kissed her.  &quot;Steven is coming over.  Shall we go upstairs to greet him?&quot;  And he grabbed her hand and lead her upstairs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=113.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=113.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=113.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=113.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=113.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm20">SchreckNET™ (Nos only)<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246i<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
