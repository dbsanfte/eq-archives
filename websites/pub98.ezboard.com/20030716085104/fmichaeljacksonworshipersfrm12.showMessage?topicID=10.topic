Oh I was so worried.” She kissed me lightly on my cheek. “How is he doctor?”<br>
<br>
“Well he seems to be suffering a bit from amnesia. He says his name is Michael Jackson unlike what you told us....um...Miss....”<br>
<br>
“Gerri.” She extended her hand. “Gerri Lynn Stockly.”<br>
<br>
“Wow.” I thought to myself. She had made a name up so fast. What was she up to? What did she do to me?<br>
<br>
“I’m sure he’s delirious. In his condition he’ll say anything. He’s my brother. I am taking care of him and he keeps trying to run away and if he can’t he tries to hurt himself. Two days ago he refused to stop banging his head on the floor so I had to drive him over here. But I’m sure he’ll be fine once I get him home.” She was good. I couldn’t lie. Once she had them out of the room I got dressed and I was released in her care.<br>
<br>
*****6:15 pm*****(Thursday)<br>
<br>
“Michael. What’s wrong?” I approached him delicately in my most revealing black lace teddy.<br>
<br>
“You know what’s wrong Xera! And I wanna know why you keep doing this to me.” His back to me, coldly.<br>
<br>
“I don’t do anything to you. This game we play back and forth. It’s getting ridiculous! How are you blame all your miss happenings on me. I’m starting to feel a bit of jealousy from you.” I tapped his bottom, making him turn over as I sat on the edge of the bed.<br>
<br>
“STOP MAKING ME OUT TO BE CRAZY! I’m not imagining this. What did you slip in my drink this time Xera. I bumped my head! That is all! How could I get a blood clot from that? And that sickening display at the hospital.” He flew off and pushed me off the bed. I think I went a bit far this time.<br>
<br>
“Ahh!” I screamed hitting the floor. “Now you’re resorting to violence.” I climbed to my feet. Coyly dusting myself off as if nothing happened.<br>
<br>
“Get out.” Was all he could say, he ran to the bathroom locking the door behind him, hoping I would be gone by morning as he settled in the bath tub for the night.<br>
<br>
******8:00 AM******(Saturday)<br>
<br>
“Sam. I gotta clear my head. I just don’t know what to do any more.” I spilled my guts out to Sam. She was the local bar keep, but I’ve known her for a while now. She was always there for me. She wasn’t the toughest but she made me feel safe when I got tired of Xera.<br>
<br>
“Why do you stay, Meme? [&lt;Her nickname for Mike] This is the third time she’s put you in the hospital. Just because you are a guy doesn’t mean you can’t be abused by a woman.” She stroked my hair as I lay in between her legs in the park.<br>
<br>
I looked up at her, “Are you kidding?! Do you know how @#%$ up that sounds? I’m the man. I’m stronger, bigger, and I’m the one with the dick! I’m the one who she should be running away from but instead it’s the opposite.”<br>
<br>
“Michael, it doesn’t make you less of a man. It just makes you a scared man.” She candy coated it lightly.<br>
<br>
“You’re making it sound like I’m afraid of HER!! I AM NOT SCARED AND AND JUST DROP IT. God Sam! What do you take me for.” I yelled at Sam and throwing my glass soda bottle smashing it against the brick wall of the deserted garage.<br>
<br>
“Michael! Chill out, man. I didn’t mean it that way. Jeez!!” She stood up about to walk away.<br>
<br>
I grabbed her arm back gently, “Sam, I’m sorry. That wasn’t me. I’m just afraid that it’s true. And she knows it. I’m a @#%$ @#%$. But I can’t help it. She’s just the devil and I can’t get her out of my @#%$ head!” I grabbed my head, falling to the ground to my knees, Confused and helpless.<br>
<br>
Sam took me back to her place and I got the much needed rest that I couldn’t get in that hard tub last night. Sam was the best and only True friend I had. Yeah I had my boys that I hang with after work but it wasn’t the same. Sam and I go all the way back to 10th grade. I’d trust her to the day I die.<br>
<br>
Two hours later I woke up to the sweet smell of pizza. Sam couldn’t cook, but she could order a mean pizza. She was a genius when it came to dialing the pizza man.<br>
<br>
“Michael! Look, I ordered pizza for us!” She smiled dropping herself on the funky green plush couch. She was watching the football game in a pair of old beat-up gray sweats and a XXX-large jersey. She reminded me a lot of my sister Janet. Such a tomboy!<br>
<br>
“Well! Whatchu wait’in for?” She turned with a piece of pizza in her mouth.<br>
<br>
“Ew! Chew your food, girl! What kind did you get?” I asked jumping on the couch next to her.<br>
<br>
“I .....goooot.....extra cheesy and spinage for you. I honestly don’t know how you eat that @#%$.” She wrinkled her face up turning her attentions back to the football game.<br>
<br>
I laughed.<br>
<br>
Sam and I had a great time together. She was just a buddy to me just like Janet. Sometime she reminded me of Janet. Sometime when she looks at me I can almost see Janet smiling at me through her. I wish she were alive today. She had so much ahead of her. Besides she kept Xera arguing all the time. It was getting late and I must have dozed off to sleep on the couch........<br>
<br>
**********Dream Sequence***********<br>
<br>
“Michael!! What are you doing in my room! Get out!” Janet yelled at me pushing me out into the hallway.<br>
<br>
“Well then next time keep your damn dirty behind out of my business!!” I screamed back!<br>
<br>
“Don’t get mad at me cause ya stupid behind was somewhere you shouldn’t have been! You lucky I was there to bail you out!”<br>
<br>
“I could’ve handled it.” I shouted back.<br>
<br>
“Whatever...! That’s why you were gett’in the crap beat out of you. Next time stay away from that girl. She ain’t no good. She gonna kill you one day!” She slammed the door in my face.<br>
<br>
“You don’t know what the @#%$ you’re talk’in about! And that girl gotta name. Her name is Xera. And she loves me. Pete was just jealous cause she ain’t want his ugly ass no more!!!” I screamed back at her half way down the stairs.<br>
<br>
I didn’t notice Joseph standing at the bottom of the stair way. As I walked backward making sure she wasn’t gonna scream back at me.<br>
<br>
“What the heck are you yelling about at this time a night, Boy!” He glared at me, knocking me against the wall.<br>
<br>
“I was just talk’in to Janet, Joseph. I didn’t know I was that loud. Sorry.” I apologized softly. Searching with my eyes to see if there was anyone other than Janet who would stop him if he started to beat me.<br>
<br>
“Just keep it down, Boy. This ain’t no crazy house. Nobody is deaf in this house!” He replied simply and walked up stairs.<br>
<br>
*********End of Dream*******<br>
To think way back then she had me brainwashed. I was only 21 at the time. When I met her and back then Janet was the one who warned me. I should have listened. She was always like a second Mother to me. After Mother died, I thought the world ended. But my Big sister was always there to give me all the love she had. If only I knew what happened to her.<br>
<br>
Just then I heard a strange sound in the back of my mind.<br>
<br>
“Sam.” I called out in the darkness, half sleep/half awake.<br>
<br>
Or could it be???????? I opened my eyes...........<br>
