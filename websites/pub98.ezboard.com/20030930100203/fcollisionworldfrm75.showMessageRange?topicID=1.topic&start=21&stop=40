The Dynasty has risen again. I can feel it. No doubt Caleb as well.&quot;<br>

Then he turned to solomon. &quot;And how many times do I HAVE to tell you its not earthly magic. its the force of the mind and I should show you a few things.&quot; he teased and shook his fist at his old companion.<br>
<br>
not granting them the fact that it had been two years. &quot;But yes.&quot; he said. &quot;I have someone on the look out already as I had sense and unkindly presence as we entered the network.&quot; he smiled and swven stayed still, He glanced once at mahrain with a questioning look and then smiled at the old women.<br>

It had been decades, sense swven had known the count back in his day. The 25 year old hadnt aged a day. his friends on the other hand, were a different story.

<br>
He took a seet on the stone counter top, aaware of his own unkempt state, and observed the new group.<br>
<br>
The Gadji must be Shalel, Mamah G had said she would be coming before long, and helping them greatly with her own magickal strength, but training was needed, Mahrain was back to her old catlike self. *funny, never thought of her as anything other than catlike. wonder why...*<br>
<br>
Caleb had returned, after what was quite a long time, even for him, and there was the issue of the cousins. *Ahh...family problems. it'll work itself out in time.*<br>
<br>
He looked inquisitivey at Amanda. She was intriguing. he diegned to answer her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. I did love scarlet once. she tried to steal my power. when she realized she couldn't take it through love, she tried pain. I was a rag doll when she was finished with me, but I was still intact, emotionally, I was a wreck, and that was when Mamah G came along. She got me through it, got me back up to standard, above standard. since then I have pledged my life to her destruction, and to saving the righteous of the world. a bit hefty, but with magick like this, what else can I do?&quot; He asked, not really asking, and carried on.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't be controlled by her, I couldn't then. not magickally at least, but she had my love, and so, emotionally, she could control me. I've tied in alot of my power with Mamah G's to protect my people and the network from any sort of mind control. we do our best. it's all that can be hoped for, Amanda Glenn.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chococow>Choco Cow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/20/03 4:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: earthly magick</span><hr size=1> Caleb felt the presence as well...it was dark, and powerful. Scarlet had made some deadly allies. He sighed, and looked at Solomon. <br>
'I should have guessed he had something with Scarlet, it seems that everyone here has a connection to her.' He looked over to the little girl 'Someone so little in a fight this big, I hope she doesn't get hurt.' He looked over to the hallway that led to the entrance, and felt the dark presence, stronger this time. <br>
&quot;Uh....Mamah G, there's someone knocking on our door, and they're not friendly.&quot;<br>

Was in the dank of the shadow of the kitchen. Hopping not to be recognized. Swven took out a rather strange looking weapon. it was a strong whip with all sorts of sharp metal attatched randomly on it. .. it looked god aweful &amp; painful. Count looked to where Mamah' G had gone. Wishing no harm upon the women .. He looked at solomon once..which to him was actually twice. <br>
<br>
He cared about the man a great deal when they were all together back in the day. But this was kept a secret to himself and to himself alone. He didnt want to be thrown out<br>
of the network for caringf or a man instead of a women.<br>
<br>
He hated being different but there was nothing that he could do about that now... He hated his stories of scarlet and wanted to kill her himself. Swven looked at Mahrain and smiled with his newly darkened eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like it's time to play.&quot; he whispered.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chococow>Choco Cow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/20/03 9:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: deadly attacks</span><hr size=1> Caleb ran towards one of the demons and jumped up and slashed at it with the dagger, As he landed he rolled back to his position, and looked at it.<br>
'Well it's not going to win any beauty contests..' It was about 8 feet tall and green, it was physically powerful, but probably had the brain of a rock, and slow too. He charged at it again, and kicked it and it lost its balance as he lodged one of the daggers into it's skull. He looked over to Swven and Mahrain, they seemed to be having as much fun as he was. then he was hurled through the air and felt himself slam up against the wall. He jumped up, and pushed the pain aside, he could worry about that later, for now, he had to get rid of the demons.<br>

<br>
she spun in mid-air bringing her daggers to rake across the monster's neck in a deadly arc.<br>
<br>
green blood sprayed fron the deep cut and Mahrain reached the ground covered in the goo. she had ended up back in attack position, and had noticed something strange, an odd aur if you will.<br>
<br>
she almost began to approach it when two of the demons caught her off gaurd, advancing on her.<br>
<br>
she fought tooth and nail, grinning fiercely at caleb and Swven.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good times boys! Good times!&quot; She called to them as she plunged her dirk into an unsuspecting demon.<br>
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile behind the rock outcropping Solomon began to tear away the ruins of Shalel's charred shirt.<br>
<br>
&quot;It hurts...&quot; SHe whimpered, trying not to move, but quivering like a taut string. It cut Solomon deep to see one of his own hurt.<br>
&quot;Don't worry sweetie, it'll be fixed soon. just hold your breath for a few seconds for me, alright?&quot;<br>
<br>
She did so obediently and he placed his hands jus a fraction aboce the blackened skin. a tear rolled down Shalel's cheek, but she said nothing.<br>
<br>
a soft green glow seemed to buoy Solomon's hand as he worked to heal the wound, pouring his healing energy into her.<br>

&quot;So,&quot; He started, taking a slash at one of them, while Mahrain attacked the other, &quot;You're not the regular kind of girl are you?&quot; He smiled, he kicked it, and it slid into the cave wall. He charged on it as he heard Mahrain yell back.<br>
&quot;Now, what would make you say that?&quot; She said, stabbing her demon.<br>
&quot;Well, let's just say most girls I know, wouldn't exactly call a brawl with two demons 'good times'.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well then, there missing out.&quot; She said, slicing it down it's stomach. Caleb shook his head and slammed the dagger into it's head, and jumped off of it. He turned to see Mahrain and Swven taking on another two or three. He smiled and went off to help them...it had been awhile since he'd gotten a good fight.<br>

<br>
The loong slinder asian hit the floor on his back he closed his eyes. As he hadnt felt paint in over 300 years.. he looked up at the ceiling its semi-glaring lights <br>
they seemed to burn his eyes now even though they werent all that bright.. But little did he know it was the blood running from them.<br>
<br>
&quot;COUNT&quot; Swven yelled. he immdediately abandoned mahrain. And ran over to the count putting a hand behind his back. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; he questioned frightfully seeing the thin red RS blood run down his cheeks.<br>
<br>
The count sat up on his own &amp; smiled softly. &quot;It's been awhile hasn't it?&quot; Swven nodded and they both stood. Count held his hand out and the screetching sword came back to him. <br>
<br>
Like some form of telekenisis. And it was. he put his index and middle finger together and then infront of his face and hair blew quietly behind him as he muttered something anciet. The two Demons imploded. Then exploaded. <br>

<br>
something wet and sticky felt as if it was crawling down the back of her neck. *Gross...it's in my hair. my stilletto is probably mucky damnit! no matter how hard I try to keep that knife hidden away, something always to it, blood, guts, bah. it's cursed.* she thought.<br>
<br>
<br>
she back up from swven and surveyed the scene before her, realizing she could see no more demons present. <br>
<br>
There was silence, only the sounds of Shalel's laboured breath brought her back to the reality of it all.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is everyone alright?&quot; SHe called out. Caleb had a slight cut along his chest, svwen was all but untouched. she glanced at her own wounds and was supprised to see she had gained some minor injuries. her right leg bled profusely, and her arm felt as though it was wrenched. count had been on the floor a moment, his eyes bleeding, she had seen it, though it hadn't registered in the heat of battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone get Mamah G!&quot; Solomon cried, looking desperate from behind the outcropping.<br>
<br>
his forte was battle, not healing. if you train for centuries in one general sort of magick, the art of killing, the art of healing grave wounds does not come easy.<br>
<br>
he was going about it the right way, but something was missing from it, something he knew and yet was intangible, but he needed to find it, and Mamah G had the answer.
