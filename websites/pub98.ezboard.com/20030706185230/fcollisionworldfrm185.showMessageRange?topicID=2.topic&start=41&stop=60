<br>
Setsuna lowered her sword and glared around. She could feel the two walking around outside. She knew that they were here to kill Psychi, but she also knew it wasn't Psychi's time to go yet.<br>
<br>
She sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Raul, I guess I'll let you live a little while longer. One more slip up though, and i won't be so leniant.&quot; she said, before returning to her little girl form. She smiled. &quot;Anyway!&quot; she chirped. &quot;I'm hungry!&quot; she said before bounding off toward the kitchen.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is too much... I need a drink...&quot; Psychi muttered. She left the house, passing Ashley on her way out. &quot;Have fun.. they're crazy... there will not be any sane people in this house hold until I return.&quot; she said, and then left for the bar.<br>
<br>
Aka smiled at Ashley.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm Aka. That was Psychi. And this is Tommi and Raul.&quot; she said, a wee bit hyperly.<br>
<br>
Just outside, Rana and Tobby were watching. Rana turned to Tobby.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rana thinks Rana and Tobby should wait until Psychi gets back. Shortness and Rana will just stay out here, and when Psychi comes back, Shortness and Rana will get her then!&quot; <p>~*~<br>

Setsuna sweat dropped at the name. &quot;Chibi one? Ano.. yeah... I kinda know 'em... well... not the chick with the glasses or the one with the funky hair, but they're all sneaky about their murderous deeds. The two loosers over there though,&quot; she said, pointing to Raul and Tommi, &quot;are kinda really not very sneaky and I caught 'em red handed! LITTERALLY!&quot; she chirped, taking a big bite outta some chocolate cake she's found somewhere in the kitchen. &quot;Anyway, I was s'possed ta kill 'em a long time ago, but I was short on time - it was a busy day - so I let 'em go on accounta they didn't tell no one who I was, but they did and now they must die! But first... WE EAT MORE CAKE!&quot;<br>
<br>
Aka stared at the little blue-haired girl oddly, taking the cake from her. &quot;No more for you, missy... you're a wee bit too hyper. Time for you to go to bed...&quot; she said, taking a bite of the cake and giving Setsuna a little shove toward the kitchen door. <br>
<br>
Setsuna glared at her and turned into a mouse, squeaking something about &quot;her cake&quot; as she frightened the poor girl away from the sweets. <p>Lotsa Luvs!<br>

&quot;Actually, Aka was born with money. Her parents were in the stocks.&quot; he said. &quot;We just moved in with her, is all. She needed some old friends to move in with her because she was lonely. And she's so accepting... I mean, she's letting complete strangers into her home.&quot; he said, looking at Ashley.<br>

&quot;Okie, Shortness. Rana believes Psychi may never come back. Rana thinks we should go back to the cave. Come on, Shortness.&quot; Rana said, standing up.
