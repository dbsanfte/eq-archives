WE HAD BASES LOADED WITH A GIRL UP TO BAT. OUR PITCHER THROUGH A SERIES OF PITCHES THROWS 3 BALLS TO HER BUT THE UMPIRE DOES NOT WALK HER. THE NEXT PITCH IS POPPED UP FOR THE LAST OUT OF THE INNING. AFTER WE GET OFF THE FIELD THE UMPIRES CONVERSE (WHICH SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE THE PITCH) AND DECIDE THE PITCH COUNT WAS ERRANT. BECAUSE OF OUR TEAMS OBJECTION (I.E. ONCE THE GIRL HIT THE BALL IT WAS PUT INTO PLAY THUS NULLIFYING ANY PROTEST {MUCH LIKE AN APPEAL PLAY FOR A PLAYER TAGGING}). THE UMPIRES WENT TO THE UIC. AND HE SAID THAT THE INNING SHOULD NOT HAVE ENDED (BASICALLY THAT THE UMPIRE IN THE FIELD MESSED UP AND SHOULD HAVE CALLED TIME). OH AND JUST FOR THE RECORD THE NEXT GUY UP HITS A GRAND SLAM.

I don't see how you can throw her three balls and be upset because she ended up getting a walk. Obviously the umps were green and didn't realize the situation. You are asking for an umps mistake to help you win a game?<br>
<br>
By the book, the inning should have ended. You're right, too late for an appeal.<br>
By all that is right in the world, the girl should have walked.<br>
<br>
Two ways to solve it from your side....don't throw three balls to the girl or don't give up the grand slam. <br>
<br>
From the other team's view they did absolutely everything right and deserved to win.<br>

Don't give up a slam.<br>

Was this a league game???? If so.. SO WHAT!!!! Leagues are for practice, even though points should be at stake. Leagues are still for practice. Tournaments are where the comp is..<br>

on that note.. Why is it that someone can put their 2 cents worth in.

So the appeal was actually legal. Here's a question for you,  Why is it that everytime someone loses a game it is the umpires fault?  I do admit that there are some terrible umpires out there, but that is why Brian has all these umpire clinics to get in fresh new umpires and get rid of the ones that are constantly blowing calls.  If you think you can do better call him and sign up.  Believe me that is why i did it, and let me tell you, it is harder than it looks.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It is part of my competive nature. But in this case I agree with the red. Forget appeals and all the other crap. Get the call right. So what if one pitch has been thrown. Get it right. Nobody wants them to go back an inning. But whenever possible forget whatever rule you have to and get the call right. <br>
<br>
Same stuff happened to us at Joplin. Girl is given a extra courtesy foul. LF is yelling hey she is out. Umpire in the field is shaking his head yes, pitcher not paying attention throws the next pitch for a single. Did the red overturn it, no we didn't appeal before the next pitch. The red in field heard us in plenty of time and was agreeing with us. To me that is appeal enough. Homeplate ump says simply if you want that call go get a rulebook.  No one was on base he simply could have said my bad your right she is out. And not really changed the outcome of the game. But instead says you don't know what your talking about go get a rbook and prove it. <br>
<br>
Funny thing is it happened again against us a couple of innings later and the field up stepped up and corrected him. Guess who brought up the rulebook line. <br>
<br>
And as far as trying to be an umpire, That is the thing that upsets me the most. I did it 8 years of HS and college baseball to go along with what I have done at different softball leagues. No I didn't know every little knit picking rule. But I got calls right. If I missed something were it was clear I was wrong and I knew it I changed the call. Yes it got me in trouble a couple of times. But I promise you I was one umpire everybody wanted when they were playing a big game. I always felt if I was going to be there I was going to bust my butt to do the best I could. And I left my ego in the dressing room. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Dont understand</span><br> <span class=usertitle>I need to register</span><br>   <font color=#8B0000>(6/15/03 1:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Keep trying</span><hr size=1> The call was right, but why don't you tell the rest of the story.

P.S. was it me or did it seem like the boys in red had a few bad calls every game? Or what about the women in red...whew....in our game and a game I watched she was talked into anything.
