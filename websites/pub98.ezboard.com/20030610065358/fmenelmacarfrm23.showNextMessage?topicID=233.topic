<br>
It seems the former 'great' or wanting to be 'great' nations have taken it upon themselves to still pretend they are these great empires.  Some micronations are able to adjust but the majority are clinging to past ideals of greatness that are long forgotten by the rest of the micronational community.  <br>
<br>
Just examples and this isn't to insult Babkha or Attera.  Babkha has been one of my favorite places to visit for a long time.  Attera hasn't been to active since the deployment of Michael but I still visit it on occasion.  Another great Micronation was Baracao whom has suffered several hits as Daffyd went inactive, and then their leadership as well.  They are slowly climbing out of this rut now.  Menelmacar itself has taken strides but has adapted and changed with them.  <br>
<br>
This nostalgia for the past makes some of these former greats still think they are great having a superiority contest with those around them.  Babkha for example recently had a citizen declade that barbarians ( I only assume us foreigners visiting ) had taken over the forums, and that Menelmacari stench was in the foreign vizier.<br>
<br>
That Babkhan still clings to the past I suppose when Menelmacar and Babkha may not have had the best relations.  I'm sure after that statement by a key babkhan figure that it's again trying to Alienate Menelmacar.<br>
<br>
You see Menelmacar has more activity on it's boards now then Attera and babkha put together.  Babkha may be able to boast of an excellent legal system.  However recently Menelmacar's making strides to surpass Babkha's productivity in micronationalism.  <br>
<br>
Even while Menelmacar struggles with internal affairs it has finally with it's new Era come out on top.  Seemingly above nations that used to consider it a bug nation.  Looking around in micronations it seems that some nations just can't adjust that they're no longer the super power they wish they where.<br>
<br>
Babkha's about to struggle with internal in fighting and it probably doesn't even realize it.  Any outsider can see that the influx of new citizens in Babkha, and the contempt of it's old citizens to hold to past Babkhan ideals it's about to under take a great upheavel.  While I sympathize I wonder if anyone but a select few has noticed. <br>
<br>
Attera has been desolute, plagued by the lack of Michael, Dabe, and other key supporters.  However Noseworthy has kept the nation alive, and with myself and Abbas made efforts to normalize relations with Babkha.  Rakesh is trying to continue this tradition (a  cool person I might add) but he is no Abbas.  So a one man Attera (as it looks from the surface) was once a great powerful empire is no longer, but you see Noseworthy knows this.  He adapts to the change, and keeps it alive for when michael can again return and help Noseworthy bring Attera back from stasis.<br>
<br>
Babkha however is about to start spinning conservative wheels.  Trying to look like it's still the most stable in the sector when the calm facade it presents to foreigners is about to change beneath the surface if shit isn't taken care of, especially when it alienates one of it's strongest micronational supporters.  The menelmacari people who have a great love for the help that Babkha gave them, whom are about to lose that admiration as key Babkhan officials seek to harass a nation that suprasses it in productivity.<br>
<br>
Menelmacar has always taken great efforts to respect diversity in the micronational world.  Wether inactive, or active it has rarely declared itself better the only occasion I can recall of recent Menelmacari prejudism is against Politikkka who has made efforts to spread propagand and lies about the Imperium.<br>
<br>
It is a shame in my eyes that other nations are not able to welcome foreigners as much as Menelmacar does.  As soon as we know who you are, and you offer us respect, we welcome you with open arms.  We don't insult you or your nation even if it does look like  pathetic one.  We just like friends, but other nations can't understand this.  Some not even knowing us have even declared us not a micronation, showing how uneducated foreigners can be.<br>
<br>
People assume since we have a more let loose attitude we're not intelligent micronationalist.  That we're not as strong of a nation, but please.  The constant in fighting we had to go through to achieve our current era has made us strong, intelligent, and as a whole more capable then most nations around us.  We can take on most projects we desire with ease and a little time.<br>
<br>
Baracao's foreign minister is walking around declaring Baracao almost dead, that it's simply a charade of past power.  That it needs to merge or will fade into destruction.  These words are irresponsibile and false, and while I do not know Hubert he needs to find another Baracaon job as he isn't portraying Baracao like he should be.  Baracao's hardly the contender it once was in the cold war it had with Menelmacar. (Which was kind of fun even though silly.).  Baracao has taken many hids, it has to many government jobs, and not enough citizens to fill them.<br>
<br>
Baracao has an interesting population though, Daffyd the dirties commie I know but an awesome character to associate with.  I still recall quite vividly the talks I used to have with him and Eoindornan about me pretending to be upset with Treesia so they could have a rec war.  Very fun individuals to associate with, and the protests in the mission of St. Hereton as some people tried to deny religions place in a society.  I appreciate them conceding that it had a place, and allowing me to run a mission there.  But it too is inactive these days but the supporters are still there, slowly coming out of hibernation.  So I have great hopes for Baracao coming back together.<br>
<br>
So who are the key players now a days in ez board micronations? Who are these nations who seem to be setting the example and making great strides in reform, and progression to be known? Well in my opinion here are a few of them.  Menelmacar, Hanover, Shireroth even.  Why do I say these names in particular? Well it's definetly not for love of hanover or Shireroth but let me explain.  I'll explain slowly to alow everyone time to adjust as it seems some nations aren't able to adjust.<br>
<br>
Menelmacar has taken great strides to get to where it is now.  It has a stable government, very little in fighting but enough difference in opinion to create activity.  They are a very close knit society all pretty much trust each other.  All are honorable micronationalist who are loyal to Menelmacar.  It continues to bring new micronationalist into the hobby.  It tries new projects, and scraps those that fail in stride.  It reconizes it's short comings and is improving on them.  It has activity not only off the board but on the board, and attracts foreigners to visit it.  As a direct democracy that says &quot;I trust you brothers enough to have a say, as much as I do.&quot; This mentality brings closeness, and allows everyone to voice their opinion and make it known.  Menelmacar is one of the best micronations around now a days.  While it uses the micras system it's evolved past it's counter parts respectfully.<br>
<br>
Hanover I've been watching them closely and while they have a bill dusch in their midst (Gresham) they seem like a rather productive community.  An out standing legal structure, an interesting economic simulation that looks like it will get some where to the point it becomes a real world economy.  It attracts foreigners (even myself I like to visit it on occasion.)  While cocky some times (who isn't.) it does have some notable micronationalist that really make it work.  Ciaron Broeck, and Thomas are stunning examples of productive citizens.  Even though I myself have my differences so you know I'm not making shit up. ( I haven't gotten along with Thomas yet.) They have a respectful paper, that debuted this week and was absolutely stunning.  Creations like this really make a nation great and they all admire their leadership.  Backing your leader is a great thing and they're doing it.<br>
<br>
So far I've discussed two other micronations Menelmacar which does not prescribe to &quot;apollo's sector&quot; but exists as a new example for new generation of productive micronationalist.  And Hanover which looks at itself as a real nation not a simulation of any sort. It is time to address a sector that began as the result of Apolyton and that is the Apollo or Micras Sector.  Lead by Erik Metzer an Erratic moody leader, it still thrives for some unknown reason.  Shireroth has gone through many phases of existing an non existing but always &quot;there.&quot;  It has gone from laughing stock amongst nations as &quot;Erik and his papels&quot; to a nation that is now &quot;Erik, his multiple personalities&quot; and a lot of new citizens.  It's attracted productive citizens like Jadie, Scott Siskind, and several new faces.  They have a closeness and like Menelmacar even visit each other in person on occasion.  They produced the first micronational novel that I've heard was great but never read. (I boycotted it but damn good job for siskind to do that.).  Shireroth is a shining example of micras sector nations that is great even with the notorious apollo personalities.  And know I this isn't propaganda because I can't stand erik Metzler but give credit where it is due.  <br>
<br>
So a rather odd combination of whom I think are todays great nations who set examples for those around them.  Lets not forget those who may again set that example as Babkha, Attera, and Baracao reorganize they may again set the example on what to do.  Lets watch and see, but lets not exclude some forgotten or new faces.<br>
<br>
Karnali ? What of this nation, I've been watching it and damnit I think it has a chance.  It's interesting how someone can reform thier personality like Hoefensfill did, but he's attractice like Menelmacari people outside of micronations creating another generation of Micronationalist.  I definetly think they have a chance once steady to become a shining example of what to do with your nation.<br>

Aerlig may too have a chance, which uses a non ez board communication system. (keep it up man I hate ez board.)  May get it's stuff together again and start showing itself to the world.<br>
<br>
There is such diversity out there right now now and it's just awesome.  Those cinging to the past need to adapt and start being progressive again to set the example for greatness. IF they don't Menelmacar and a few others will do it for them to keep the progressive attitude that new generation micronationalist bring with them.  <br>

For an example, before the revolution this nation was in deep inactivity, even chatting was low. Now, after a peaceful revolution all citizens at that time accepted we/you have boosted more activity than we had before the first revolution! More peeps have come, (including me), and were finally getting somewhere. <br>
<br>
We are a community, a proud micronation. We must treasure OUR Menelmacar. The other one is dieing while the two leaders are gone in inactivity (Siri, Jadi), and the only active there is David Beckford, and hes not even a citizen there. Sorry, we shouldnt compare us to others, not what I want to say is that we have a chance building something big. Not necessarily a superpower, but a nation where we can be happy together, and engage in our community. <br>
<br>
After we set up the Law Smith, we can together build laws, and bring Menelmacar to a more stable state,  and while we have our community we wont die. Maybe an inactivity now and then, but we will live (unlike Siriland).<br>
<br>
Our hopes and Dreams for Menelmacar are a significant part of our country, let us share them with eachother so that together we can build a better Menelmacar, a living Menelmacar, whose elements will spread into the rest of the microworld and start a new era for micronationalism. <br>
<br>
Even if this may not come true, the belief we have in Menelmacar is fundamental here. Without feeling hope for her, the need to grow into betterment, our country will fall. Together we can build Menelmacar better; together Menelmacar will be an open place for everyone.<br>
<br>
I remember the intermicronational discussions Menelmacar hosted, the History of the Microworld, and the Round Table of Micronational Philosophy. We were a centre for education and discussion :-). That is nostalgia. I also remember, this time with sadness, the betrayal I felt from the people behind the coup détat. <br>
<br>
Many nations have recently lost their soul, some forever,  and some are trying to find it again. Our sould was lost the weeks before the first election, but we are finding it again. And soon it will be better than ever. <br>

I believe your abscence has left you a little in the dark in that we already are a happy community.  Already enjoying ourselves, and the foreigners who visit us.  However I appreciate your kind words and hope more follow.<br>
<br>
Menelmacar's a great place already, and really brings stability, and foreigners have asked me quite a few times to help them with their nations.  Even begged, I've offered my services at times.  Which is the way the micronational world SHOULD be.  People like Trevon who I wish would join us as a citizen is a shining example.  He is helping with our HTML with no compensation, and better yet is sharing his stories.  This is what micronationalism is about in Menelmacar, sharing our talents for the better of this hobby, and sharing our lives as friends of each other.<br>
<br>
That is what makes Menelmacar great.  Friendship, loyalty, and the passion that motivates us to keep this nation solid and strong. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The allegation that this technology would create a machine to spy on others and invade people's privacy is way off the mark. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> -- Jan Walker, DARPA </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arirahikkala>Ari Rahikkala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Self-Declared<br>

Actually, Shireroth doesn't officially recognise the existence of micronational &quot;sectors&quot; at all. Unofficially, though, I have to say that if there's any nation that can be called an active Apollo nation anymore, it's Shireroth. It's just different to the Apollo culture in the way that instead of lots of little sovereign nations being live and die, there's one nation under which lots of little duchies and baronies live and die while the one nation just goes on living. Heck, I'm going to enrage Erik by saying this (if he happens to get to read this), but I'd say that Shireroth is the One Giant Apollo Merger That Succeeded... because it was not a merger. <br>
<br>
As for the other parts... I agree with a lot of what you've said, but do doubt you ideas about Babkha and Hanover. Babkha might cling to the past, yes, but on the other hand it's shown to be remarkably flexible before - I have to say that I'm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sort of amazed by how they managed to get past losing Shah Babak. You could take the constant influx of newbies (that seems to me to be much quicker than of any other nation's that I visit - it's like there's always somebody new there every time I visit) as a sign of being a much more vibrant community than others, you know. It's even possible that Babkha <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>needs</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be conservative and it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>needs</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to teach the new people to Babkhan ways because all the newbies would simply tip the nation over if it didn't. What is true is that they aren't advancing as quickly they could be - but no nation ever is.<br>
<br>
About Hanover's economy... it's nice, true. Their bank is around fourty times better than the script I made years ago and am still ashamed about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I like the way the economy is designed and bound to real goods and services - simulated economies have had a tendency of being either too boring, too elaborate or both so nobody's ever been interested in actually participating in them. However, with the close binding of the economy to Hanover, I do doubt if they have enough people to actually provide the services to get an economy up. But I guess the Hanoverians <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>are</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> so patriotic that they'll rather try to run things themselves than see the value in creating a trade area of the size of the microworld...  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://hackles.org/cgi-bin/archives.pl?request=299">&quot;I believe they just installed Gentoo Linux.&quot;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=riclyon>RicLyon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Enlightened One</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#FF9300>(6/7/03 2:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmenelmacarfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nostalgia and Greatness (Warning: Candor)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Friendship, loyalty, and the passion that motivates us to keep this nation solid and strong.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

Well I believe that's one of the aspects that makes them good is the constant influx.  It also is a problem as you can see as they aren't being taught as rigorously what it means to be Babkhan.

Nothing wrong with conservatism but they are clinging to a past that isn't there.  They are no longer that &quot;super&quot; power they where months ago.  No doubt they are still a great nation, but not a power house like before. <br>

I'll have a full analysis of this speech (and of course its background) in the next Citizen, so I won't talk much now, but I must say one thing in response to Ari:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But I guess the Hanoverians are so patriotic that they'll rather try to run things themselves than see the value in creating a trade area of the size of the microworld... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->In saying this I'm not just patriotically defending my country: I genuinely think you're mistaken. We <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>do</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> see the value in creating an intermicronational real goods economy. Our Prime Minister is the leading proponent of the free distribution of Talens to all foreign citizens who apply - he believes, as I think logic dictates, that we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a bigger consumer and supplier base for our economy to survive and grow, and we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>are</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> taking steps towards that. <br>
<br>
For one thing, anyone here can go to the Royal Bank of Hanover right now and apply for an account. You should be up and running with 400T in a couple of days, and ready to be part of the micronational economy. As part of the raspur conference talks, which I thank Babkha for graciously hosting, a plan to promote an integrated micronational real-goods economy is part of the overall plan. We're doing all we can to expand our economy outside of our borders - we just need people like you to start buying and selling to support us, and one day we'll have a viable economy built out of logical benefit.<br>
<br>
That said, I also disagree that Hanover is too closely associated with its economy. We do have pride in our bank, but I believe there are many other parts of our nation that make us great, just as I think there are great nations that don't really host an economy. <p>Read <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/citizen_editor/CITIZEN.pdf">CITIZEN</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Initially we only allowed accounts to citizenry, after some arguement I think we all now agree that for an economy to function in needs a very large consumer base. To prevent people registering multiple accounts we generally try and verify that an applicant is an individual, to speed this process up please use your micronational identity as your account name.<br>

Well for one what's having money whatever it's called if their isn't affordable products _I wants_.   I am a gamer, but no where in micronations is their a game store to rent/buy video games for micronational money.<br>
<br>
I'm an artist, but no where in micronations are there places for me to buy copper, embossing tools, cameras, etc. With micronational money.<br>
<br>
Capitalism uses supply and demand.  You don't have the supply I demand so there is no point in participating in the economies most of you develope.  I see no point in playing in a casino where I lose money or gain money.  Because that money is worthless to me because I can't buy anything I need.<br>

Productivity doesn't necessarily come from economies.  Menelmacar doesn't have an economy but it is proudctive trying new projects, and enganging in talks, and friendships.  Menelmacar's atheletic association really helped get the citizens back into the swing of things.  Eanon is making attempts at a independent role playing organization to start games.  The conclave because the old laws where so jacked up because they all revoled around an elenaran it was easier just to start over.  And the new format of our nation while their is more beaurcracy things get done right.  It allows us to be productive.  That and the 3-4 new immigrations will again help our productivity once we integrate these fine new citizens into menelmacar.<br>
<br>
That is more what I had in mind by productivity, I was not really targeting post count, or economic statistics, that some use to determine the health of a nation.  When in reality it isn't about the post count like so many apollo nations focus on.  A great example would be Attera, it's definetly NOT dead, however the post count is no there.  Another example is the Collective Unconscious, they rarely post in the public forum, but if you check the private forums for the small crowd they've had quite a few posts because of new programs I started.<br>
<br>
So posts can hardly dictate the health of a nation.  Though they could be used to help an economic model of a sort (simulation? ) in some cases I had heard of people doing this.. at the ICEO if I recall. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The allegation that this technology would create a machine to spy on others and invade people's privacy is way off the mark. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> -- Jan Walker, DARPA </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hoefensfill>hoefensfill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>A Dolphin

Yes but as an imperfect indicator the economy still works. Its not just post count, but activity specific to interest and resonsibility. It is also the  innovation and development aspects of the micronation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://collectiveunconscious.port5.com/Animations/Roma.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Scrolls<br>

I don't believe I understood this question... what is resonsibility? I couldn't find it in the dictionary.. would you mind explaining?<br>

What's innovative about the current economies besides the banking script?  The current buisnesses are just repeats of the last simulated economies, and the same &quot;bsuinesses&quot; or services offered in micronations without an active economy.<br>
