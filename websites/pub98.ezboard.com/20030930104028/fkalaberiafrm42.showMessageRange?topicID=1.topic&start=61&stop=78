Dropping the bundle of clothes she'd been carrying all this time, she sat down on the bed. If he didn't want help she sure as hell wasn't going to argue with him.<br>
<br>
She hadn't realized how tired she was until now. It had been a long night, what with outrunning Cale's friends then coming down here with Vania. Turning slightly, Taylee looked longingly back at the bed, hoping that she'd be able to get some rest before the others planned on going back out.<br>
<br>
Hearing George say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I'll put a real cast on if we can make it back to my hideout. Now, where are these weapons?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Taylee let out a small sigh. there was no way she trusted this man enough to go to his 'hideout'. Hell, there was no way she trusted him, period. Looking at him, she spoke up for the first time since entering the room, &quot; I don't know about you....&quot; she glanced at Cynthia, including her, &quot;but I think we should rest before we go out there.&quot; Shrugging, she continued, &quot;or...you can leave me here, and come back after you get your weapons. I guess the choice is yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not waiting for their answer she slid the worn leather coat off, tossing it to the foot of the bed, then plopped down on the bed and stretched out. 'Damn,' she thought, a real smile creeping across her features, 'it's been a long time since I've slept in a real bed.'<br>
<br>
(ooc: George would call her Taylee because thats how she introduced herself to him.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/16/03 9:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back to Vania's we go</span><hr size=1> &quot;Suit yourself, princess,&quot; George replied, giving her a single finger salute behind her back. &quot;Personally, if the boss men try to turn the lights off, again, I want to be awake for it.&quot; Grabbing a cigarette from his pocket and a lighter from the table, George started smoking. It always calmed him down.<br>
<br>
Looking over the walls, he found a sword that was shorter than the rest. &quot;A full tang katana.&quot; He took it down and strapped it to his back so that the handle was pointed down and on his right. He spent a few minutes practicing swinging the weapon, as well as sheathing and unsheating it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=knightspasr>knightspasr</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://stu.aii.edu/~job312/werespider.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/16/03 10:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> a short rest?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Sleep would be good I think me and Alexander here well keep watch though for at least in this form our sense are hire and I can't say I trust anyone here now”  Cynthia looks at the already sleeping Taylee, and shakes her head.<br>
“We are all damned but none like you ours was more natural and or choose I can not hold anything against you for being a ghoul that is only …. the work of true evil.  George I know why you hate my friend and I but how can you hate what is for lack of better word a child.  Who was used and hurt and screwed over in the head like she was, at least she knows to fight back and is trying to reconcile herself from what she was made in to and might yet be unmade from.”<br>
Cynthia moves around the room finding a few guns some knives and other tools that are loosely placed about checking for stuff and finding not her, her own surprise that there are not many weapons for who would want much more then they can carry. <br>

The room was quiet, the city around them subdued, in shock from the disastrous betrayal.<br>
<br>
Rolling over and swinging her legs off the edge of the bed, she sat up, elbows leaning on knees and her face covered in her hands. Damn dreams. Why did they always have to come when they weren't wanted. Not that these dreams were ever wanted. Taylee sighed, pushing her hair off of her face, where strands had stuck to her sweaty cheeks.<br>
<br>
What the hell was she gonna do now, she wondered. Stuck with people that despised her, maybe she'd have been better off not coming here. Vania had told her she'd help her, but Vania was gone..certainly in need of help herself, now.<br>
<br>
Taylee sat there lost in thought, not sure what she should do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/17/03 3:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a short rest?</span><hr size=1> George limped over. &quot;Well, it seems the princess has awakened, and she didn't even need a frog prince to kiss her.&quot; He sheathed the sword before she thought he was going to decapitate her with it. &quot;I think it's time to go.

The whole time he spoke he took many precautions not to look at Taylea. George was not prepared to open that can of worms just yet. &quot;I know I've given you no reason to trust me. But look at it this way. I need help to get to my hide out. (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Admitting you need help now?

<br>
Without saying anything she listened as he continued talking. She watched him sheath the sword he'd found, thankful that it was no longer a threat. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I think it's time to go.

<br>
As he finished <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;....and I give you my word as a hunter I'll not kill you.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she let the silence drag out for a minute, trying to get her anger under control.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you..&quot; she said quietly, &quot;really think I'd help you?&quot; Her voice began to rise as she stood up beside the bed, &quot;or that I'd trust you? I'd rather take my chances with these people thinking maybe I had something to do with-with all this,&quot; she threw her hand out in a sweeping gesture, &quot;then go anywhere with you. Christ I'm so repulsive to you, that you cant even look at me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Turning away Taylee bent down to retrieve her coat from the foot of the bed. 'Why?' she thought, 'should it bother me, what he thinks of me. He's just some narrow minded asshole.' But it did bother her that he looked down on her because of something she'd had no choice in.<br>
<br>
Pushing past the blonde man she went out the doorway, and stopped. There was no place to go. Sliding down the outside wall, she sat on the ground to wait. She knew he was right, she couldn't stay here. Not with all the hateful looks she'd gotten even when she was with Vania. A single tear slid down her cheek, but she brushed it away angrily. Where could she go?<br>

But he was still trying to deny it, though his allowed himself to wisper under his breathe so that none could hear him, &quot;I never said I was repulsed by you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Finding a pen and some paper he wrote his address down. Pushing the curtain aside, George walked out, again not looking at Taylee. He dropped the paper beside her. &quot;If you change your mind, princess.&quot; With that he walked as fast as he could towards the exit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/17/03 9:56 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/tayav.jpg width=134 height=190></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Exit</span><hr size=1> Taylee sat staring straight ahead for some time. She'd seen the paper drop beside her but ignored it for the longest time. As she began to calm down she started to notice people walking by. <br>
<br>
It looked like the city was returning to some semblance of normal. Although the faces that passed her wore troubled and fearful expressions. That's when she noticed wary, and in some cases even hateful looks directed her way.<br>
<br>
Taylea sighed. Why couldn't they see she just wanted a life. 'God,' she thought, 'why did Vania have to bring me here....give me hope.' She'd had no hope of anything but survival until she'd seen this place. A place where people were trying to live their lives in some sort of normalcy.<br>
<br>
'And why did that bastard have to show up,' as she thought about George, she looked down, seeing the paper he'd dropped before leaving. Taylee picked it up reading the address before shoving it in her coat pocket. &quot;Like hell, I'll ever change my mind,&quot; she grumbled to herself.<br>
<br>
Standing up, she stretched, then noticed several people had stopped some ways off and were pointing towards her. 'Damn, that doesn't look good,' she told herself, starting to move in the other direction. Walking swiftly from Vania's she dodged her way through the streets. She hoped that Cynthia and the wolf would be alright.<br>
<br>
Hearing shouting behind her she turned, looking as she moved faster. They were still there and had gained on her. &quot;Stop!&quot; she heard shouted as she began to run, &quot;your wanted for questioning in the disappearance of.....&quot; Ah crap she hated the fact that that jerk had been right.<br>
<br>
Turning off one of the bigger roads, Taylee found herself in a labyrinth of smaller tunnels, but she had no time to try and figure out where she was going. Running blindly, she first noticed there were no longer any people around, then she noticed how dim the lighting had become. Looking back, she realized she must have lost those chasing her sometime ago.<br>
<br>
Stopping, she bent over, her breathing harsh in the silent tunnel. &quot;Could this night get any better?&quot; she asked outloud, raising her eyes upward. &quot;Lost underground, now what the hell am I gonna do?&quot; <br>
<br>
After resting for a few more minutes she began to walk farther down the tunnel. As she walked she noticed two things, one, no one had been in here in a long time, and two, there was a definite breeze coming from the direction she was going. Why, if there was an opening, would there not be guards. Taylee found the answer to that question as she reached the end. Barring her way, was a heavy iron grate, thick with vines camouflaging it. No one was guarding it because no one had seen it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=knightspasr>knightspasr</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://stu.aii.edu/~job312/werespider.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/17/03 11:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Exit</span><hr size=1> Cynthia watched both people storm out of the room ignoring the fact that she and Alexander where just out the room and heard everything.  Not wanting too get involved in what looked more like a poor attempt at friendship gone astray Cynthia watched until Taylee went off in a run.  With a gentle tap on Alexander, Cynthia followed Taylee tracking her through the maze and to the tunnel only to stop once she noticed there was wind real air coming down here and not from a way it should.<br>

Then she blinked. Running over to the grate she began to feel around, looking for a way to open it. <br>
The vines had intertwined through the grate so that she couldn't see anything at first. Then her hand fell on a large padlock hanging at the bottom. Grabbing it she studied it for a minute then tugged at it. Nothing. The lock would not give. &quot;Of course, it couldn't be open,&quot; she grumbled outloud. <br>
<br>
Panicking she began to shake the grate trying to dislodge it from the opening it covered. But all that did was tire her out. Sliding to the ground she ran a hand through her hair with a sigh. Thoughts began to crowd her mind. Thoughts she'd rather not deal with at the moment. Why hadn't she just sucked up her pride and left with George. She'd be out of here now if she had. He had said she could leave once she helped him. But where would she have gone. There was no place. And now she couldn't stay here either.<br>
<br>
Getting back up, Taylee took her knife out of her pocket and started to try to open the lock. After several minutes all she had done was frustrate herself further. The lock still wouldn't give.<br>
<br>
She'd grown accustom to the silence surrounding her and immediately heard the small sounds of someone or something back behind her in the tunnel. Taylee reached for her gun, and turning, listened. She knew it was there. 'Damn,' she thought 'I wont be cornered like an animal.'<br>
<br>
She looked at the grate, with it's lock, almost taunting her as it dangled there barring her escape. Raising the gun she took careful aim, and fired, once then again. Moving quickly, she kicked the grate several times, until the lock gave up it's job and fell to the floor shattered.<br>
<br>
With her heart pounding, Taylee squeezed through the opening and out into the night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blindeserra@kalaberia>Blinde Serra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/20/03 4:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Exit</span><hr size=1> Listening to the conversation through the doorway, Alexander kept a watch on the general population outside. People seemed to slip back toward their normal days as easily as if nothing had happened. A few, more official looking, walked about asking questions. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I've seen this before</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought to himself. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Soon they will be suspecting the new comers. The different. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
With a pained sigh, he resigned himself to questioning. Before the thought could come to fruitation however, an escape route provided itself. George and Taylea both concluding their heated discusion stormed out of the room. Watching the human George walk off in one direction, Cynthia's tap brought his attention to Taylea. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Poor girl is more alone than even I am. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he mused. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Not even a pack mate to call her own</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Looking back to George, a man very used to living the life of the lone wolf, already walking off injured leg and all, Cynthia bade him to follow Taylea. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> George can take care of himself, </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Trotting beside Cynthia, Alexander followed Taylea into the tunnels, watching as she was nearly accosted by the officials. Already forming a plan to break her loose from her captors, she solved this problem for him aswell. She bolted like a faun in front of the pack. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> She is fast, </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought with a grin. <br>
<br>
The officials, content in their safe saroundings could not keep up on lazy legs. She quickly out distanced them, but simply could not stop herself from running it seemed. She was gone from sight in moments. <br>
<br>
Following the pack of men from a distance, Cynthia and he took up Taylea's trail. The men split into groups at one turn off in the tunnel. Placing his nose to the ground, he quickly found Taylea's familiar scent. Looking up at Cynthia, a very soft short yip and a look down one of the  tunnels indicated his knowledge. <br>
<br>
The second group, upon coming to another intersection decided to stay together for safety apparently, for they all took the turn off when it presented itself. Once more testing the ground for Taylea, he was a bit confused. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Damn smelly men </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought to himself in disgust. <br>
<br>
Following each trail a short distance, he quickly picked up on her scent once more. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> They've lost her! </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a surge of elation crept up his spine.<br>
<br>
Leading Cynthia down the tunnel further, they were suddenly greeted by  an ear splitting bang. And again. With a yelp, he quickly tried to silence, he shook his head. Someone had fired a gun. Breaking into a dead run, hoping Cynthia could keep up, he dashed forward toward the source of the sound.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=knightspasr>knightspasr</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://stu.aii.edu/~job312/werespider.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/21/03 6:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Exit</span><hr size=1> Cynthia hears the shot and runs trying to keep up with Alexander but slowly losing pacing.  <br>
“Taylee are you okay are you alive who is up there it is me and Alexander” then silence running needing the air in her lungs to push herself after Alexander. <br>
Seeing no other choice she shift to a half-spider then continues her run not falling behind anymore and better set to help Cynthia yells out again.<br>
“Taylee we are friends we well help you, you are not alone down here”  <br>

Damn, that had been a stupid idea, using the gun, she told herself. Now they'd find her for sure.<br>
<br>
As she hit the ground, hard, she began to roll down an embankment. Old vines and blackberry brambles covered the incline and scratched and tore at her exposed parts as she slid farther and farther into the ditch. Finally coming to a stop close to the bottom, Taylea chanced a look up, to see if anyone had seen her and followed. Not seeing anyone yet, she began to move through the dead brush, hiding as best she could.<br>
<br>
Tyalea found as she moved that when she'd fallen, it seemed that in addition to cuts and scratches, she'd also bruised her shoulder. Stopping, she decided to use the cover this brush created and rest here. <br>
<br>
Huddling under a large bush covered with blackberry vines, Taylea pulled her knees up and lay her cheek against them. Sighing, she wondered if there were any vamps around, but didn't think so, as they tended to stay more around the buildings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/26/03 5:16 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/tayav.jpg width=134 height=190></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Into the night</span><hr size=1> As she sat under the brush, Taylee kept her eyes on the opening she'd come out of, watching for any sign of someone following her. After about 10 minutes she decided she was safe and stood up. She winced at the scrapes and bruises that now littered her body but tried to ignore them as she headed out. <br>
<br>
Following the ditch, she soon came to a dead end and climbed up the side to the road. Waiting and watching to make sure she didn't have any unwanted company, Taylee lay in the tall dead grass.<br>
<br>
 For one brief moment, she'd had hope that she wasn't alone, and would maybe get out of this alive. But that had come to an abrupt end, when Vania disappeared. Shaking her head, Taylee pushed these thoughts aside. It wouldn't do any good to dwell on what might have been, and it was far crueler now that she knew what she couldn't have. &quot;Shut up,&quot; she muttered to herself getting to her feet and heading cautiously out into the open. &quot;Guess I'll try to get back to the park,&quot; she said, reaching her hand into her pocket, and wrapping her hand around her gun.<br>
