<br>
I'm still not making the connection between a foreskin that is not retractable yet and pain during an erection.  All children have erections.  All of my sons have including my current intact son and not having a retractable foreskin does not cause them pain or tearing.  It seems to me that removing even more skin, thus having even less skin to compensate when the penis enlarges, would just increase the problem if this is what is causing the pain.  I'm not in any way tyring to express doubt that your nephews experience pain, I'm just having trouble seeing how having an intact foreskin is related to it.<br>
<br>
Was there another skin condition involved?  If so, were other treatment measures considered?  I mean, if I have cracked chapped lips I put some chapstick on, don't cut my lips off, KWIM?<br>

<br>
As far as creams to help other things like the *rare* cases that a foreskin has not detached from the glans by adulthood they are called steroid creams.  They do exist and are, I understand, quite effective.<br>
<br>
My friend had to use one on her child in fact for an adhesion (this was something different that the NORMAL attachment of the foreskin to the glans and thus was diagnosed and taken care of in childhood).  While unusual, these types of things happening to genitals happen, they aren't magical body parts immune from incident, I just think we happen to freak out a little more because of &quot;hang ups&quot; we have about our sex organs.<br>

As I read this article, I felt that he was adressing, the traditions of people who may join the church.  Or the traditions of the saints when policies change  But it was also evident that as long as the &quot;tradition&quot; was not contrary to revealed doctrine, it really didnt matter whether they practiced it or not.  So the Jewish Saints continued to obstain from pork or maybe they continued to circumsize  their boys.  It was not harmful or against Gods laws so it didnt matter if they continued to do it as long as they didnt insist that gentile converts do it.  I found nothing in the article that suggests that circumcision is contrary to God's will. --  Shirene<br>

<br>
I was not suggesting that article was saying circumcision was wrong (even though I personally think that it is), I was using that article to show that the prophets are not always going to speak out about something if it is.  You implied that you thought if this mattered they would speak on it, and most of my post in reply was to show why I don't think they necesarily would.  Yes, the do give some practical guidelines to help us understand how to apply the principles, but for the most part we are taught correct <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>principles</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> but left to govern ourselves, but not without the corresponding natural consequences whether they be good or bad.<br>
<br>
Just to add even more to that, in his Feb 2 fireside address Elder Packer said this:  &quot; It is a principle, and you have the freedom to do as you will. You do not have to be commanded in all things. Without having to have the Church deliver a statement on it, you should know what the Lord’s position is on abortion or cloning or same-gender marriage or birth control. All of those things are built in as a part of what we know and what we are.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not suggesting that if we &quot;Read between the lines&quot; there really is some secret policy about this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , just suggesting that there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>are</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> principles that involve understanding our bodies, why we have them, and what capabilites this brings us. How we treat them reflects out attitudes about them.<br>
<br>
It's not a matter of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>whether</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> we have a foreskin or not, but a matter of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>why</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (or should I say why not).<br>
<br>
Hope that made more sense.<br>

Let me also just say that I’m not really addressing anyone in particular here, just the topic in general, I found that piece about it was very interesting and an easy way to address a lot of the issues surrounding it.<br>
<br>
Also, I would suggest that if anyone is like me (or like I was back when I had my sons circumcised because I didn’t think removing that “flap of skin”, whatever it was, was a big deal) and doesn’t really understand what a foreskin is, finding out will help you understand why people would bother taking the time to debate about it’s removal.<br>
<br>
And, one more thing, it’s been a while since I’ve engaged in a point by point type debate and I miss it, as will be evidenced by the lengthy posts on this matter that I’m going to subject anyone who is willing to read it all to.  Proceed with caution  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Even the most secular of Jews, who observe no other part of Judaism, almost always observe these laws. … many otherwise non-observant Jews observe the entire ritual.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This seems to be to be evidence of what a powerful cultural norm this is.  That it has less to do with religious devotion and more to do with sticking to a very strong cultural norm even among those who claim to believe it is a covenant (why, otherwise, would this be the one thing that otherwise non practicing Jews decide to go ahead with anyway?) is very telling about the motivation behind circumcision.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Like so many Jewish commandments, the brit milah is commonly perceived to be a hygienic measure; however the biblical text states the reason for this commandment quite clearly: circumcision is an outward physical sign of the eternal covenant between G-d and the Jewish people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
OK, so we’ve established that this is not part of any health code as some other Jewish observances are.  I point this out because I know I used to wonder if there weren’t health benefits and that was why it was used, and that even thought it wasn’t required as a covenant anymore (as a Christian) it was still a good thing to do for health and hygiene.  I think realizing that this was not instated for health purposes is important to understanding circumcision.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The health benefits of this practice are merely incidental. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This would better read “The alleged health benefits” or perhaps “the specious health benefits”.  I have been visiting the debate board on circ at BC for over a year now and no one as of yet as shown that any of the alleged benefits can be credited to circumcision any more than eating ice cream causes drowning (IOW, just because they both happen more often in the summer doesn’t mean one caused the other).<br>
<br>
On the other hand the psychological “benefits” to those of us who have come to prefer circumcised penises has become very evident.  Two words: cognitive dissonance.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It is worth noting, however, that circumcised males have a lower risk of certain cancers, and the sexual partners of circumcised males also have a lower risk of certain cancers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Let’s go straight to the horses mouth for this one:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_Can_penile_cancer_be_prevented_35.asp?sitearea=">www.cancer.org/docroot/CR...?sitearea=</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
“In the past, circumcision has been suggested as a strategy for preventing penile cancer. This suggestion is based on studies that reported much lower penile cancer rates among circumcised men than among uncircumcised men. However, most researchers now believe those studies were flawed, because they failed to consider other factors that are now known to affect penile cancer risk. For example, some recent studies suggest that circumcised men tend to have certain other lifestyle factors associated with lower penile cancer risk -- they are less likely to have multiple sexual partners, less likely to smoke, and more likely to have good personal hygiene habits. Most public health researchers believe that the penile cancer risk among uncircumcised men without known risk factors living in the United States is extremely low. The current consensus of most experts is that circumcision should not be recommended as a strategy for penile cancer prevention.”<br>
If someone is honestly and truly so afraid of contraction penile cancer that they would be willing to have part of their penis amputated “just in case” it would provide some small protection from it (which I honestly don’t think it really would provide), they why not let them decide to do it when they are older (penile cancer doesn’t strike children), sort of like women who decide to have preventative mastectomies?  And breast cancer is BY FAR so much more common than penile cancer, so don’t take that comparison to mean that they are similar.  I’ve heard that breast cancer in MEN is actually more common than penile cancer.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Circumcision involves surgically removing the foreskin of the penis.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I’m really interested in knowing what the circumcision that was done in Old Testament times entailed.  Was it merely pricking the foreskin to draw blood?  More invasive?  How much skin was supposed to be removed?  Has it changed over time?  I know that there are people who believe that since God said it should be done at one time think it must still be OK, but how do we know what exactly it was that God said was OK?<br>

<br>
That’s what I’ve always believed.  I find it interesting that there are Christians who believe they should circumcise because the “Bible says so” but I don’t think it was considered of effect in that way unless, as was stated here, it was done by a religious leader with proper authority. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>To the best of my knowledge, there is no concrete, scientific evidence that circumcision has any harmful effect.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I beg to differ.  Please visit the numerous resources that have been posted by MamG, DL and others in the other thread for more info about that.  Also, consider whether we really need a “study” to prove that cutting a piece of richly innervated tissue off of one of the most sensitive parts of a boys body, leaving the part is was supposed to be covering an protected open and raw is harmful.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The rate of complications from circumcision is one of the lowest of all surgical procedures, and the most common complication is simply excessive bleeding.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Just because people don’t even realize what the complications are does not mean they don’t exist.  Besides, there is damage inherent in the procedure itself, even when it goes well.  The fact that exposed skin becomes dry and calloused (less sensitive) is not rocket science.   For examples of other not so uncommon complications see again the resources already provided in the other thread.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>At most, the latest scientific evidence indicates that the health benefits of circumcision are not as great as previously assumed, thus there is no reason to perform routine circumcisions for the purposes of hygiene.

<br>
A semi concession here worth noting.  What this really means is that the “possible benefits” are so minute that they do not outweigh the possible harm caused.  Consider that I would also have the “possible health benefit” of never having an infecting ingrown toenail if my mother had amputated my big toes when I was little.  A friend of ours had his amputated as an adult because of a really gross and painful infection.  He can still walk and plays basketball, so don’t try to tell me that flap on his foot was that big a deal to do away with.  I guess girls who have had their labia sliced away can rest easy that at least they won’t ever get labial cancer.<br>

Take your youngest son's t-shirt and pull it over your head.  This is what I am describing.  Yes, you put chapstick on your lips, but did you put it on your episiotomy?  Now imagine giving yourself an episiotomy 3-4 times a day for extended periods (meaning improper healing) and doing this for 7 years.  Okay, it didn't happen to your kids, lucky for you that your kids are like 90% of the rest of the country.  All kids may get erections, but do they last all night and does it make them cry?  No?

I have no doubt that you had only loving intentions in having your own son circumcized and I'mi mpressed that you researched it before hand (I did not sadly before my first two sons had it done).  I'm just trying to figure out how what you are describing is related to them being intact.<br>
<br>
From what I know about the condition, the long lasting erections were definately painful, but shouldn't be causing any kind of tearing or bleeding like you are describing.  I understand your description there about stretching something that is too small over something else and the pain it would cause, but that is not part of what priapism does. Your description of what would happen to them is not what happens to most intact boys whose foreskins have not seperated fromt their glans yet experience during an erecetion.  That's why I think there was something else going on along with the priapism there with your nephews, and I'm just trying to figure out the whole story.<br>
<br>
Had your nephews been subjected to premature retraction (it was common for doctors to instruct parents to pull the foreskin back to clean under it, but this is incorrect and actually caused damage to a lot of intact boys including forming scar tissue)?  Was their skin irritated by use of bubble bath or soaps?  This is extremely rare, but do you know was BXO is and was that skin condition possible?<br>
<br>
  These are the types of questions I have about what happend to your nephews.  YOu are of course under no obligation to divulge the full details of their situation, but   unless you do with are left with half truths to try and base an opinion on about whether circumcision was the proper treatment and/or an effective preventative measure which is what you are asserting.  I can confidently say, and back up with information from medical websites, that circumcision is not a cure nor preventative measure for priapism nor relief for pain in those with priapism.  I also highly doubt it was the best correction/prevention for whatever other problem was present that caused the tearing and infections, but we can't address that fully until we have more information about that.<br>
<br>
Many doctors in the US were known to use circumcision as a first resort rather than a last resort and I'm just trying to figure out if there is a less invasive measure to treat what was going on.  Not to question your own motives mind you, just to set the record straight about whether there are medical benefits to circumcision which is what is being debated here.<br>
<br>
And as far as episiotomies go, I've never had one.  A woman's vagina is designed to stretch open to allow a baby through, it is a natural function of that body part.  Yes, there are times when it tears and when it does, yes it hurts and yes as a matter of fact I know people who have put certain creams (vaginal &quot;chapstick&quot; if you will) on them to help sooth it.  And while we are on the subject, the molding and squeezing that happens when a baby was born is also something the bodies of the mother and baby were designed to do.<br>
<br>
Penises on the other hand were not designed to have a part of them surgically amputated.<br>

Exodus 4:25, 1 Samuel 18:25-27, and 2 Samuel 3:14 all speak of the foreskin as being more than pricked...sounds fairly invasive to me!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It is first mentioned in Genesis 17:10-11, and no specifics are given as to the nature of it. (Although my previous mentioned verses make me think it was somewhat substantial.)  Considering that God directly spoke to these men, and His covenant was set up with them doing this...I'd say it's a pretty good guess that the way they did was the way God said....I have no idea if it has changed over time though.<br>

<br>
I read the link you posted, although it wasn't directed towards me.. hope you don't mind me making some comments!<br>
<br>
&quot;The group with the largest number of sexually mutilated men in the world is the Muslims. Second in numbers come the Americans. And in a distant third place come the Jews.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well at least we Muslims have finally come first somewhere! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I also find it interesting that the author has Americans as being a separate religion.. there are the Muslims, the Jews and then &quot;The Americans&quot;.. guessing here, is he a proponent of the whole &quot;America is a Christian nation&quot; thing? <br>
<br>
I read though his biblical references.. now first, although I spent 12 years in Catholic school, I'm not really fluent on the bible, but I felt that some of his interpretations were questionable.  For example, he quotes:<br>
<br>
&quot;Titus 1:10 For there are many rebellious people, idle-talkers, and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 1:11 who must be silenced because they mislead whole families by teaching for dishonest gain what ought not to be taught.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, to me this reads like a slam on Jewish people, but he interprets it as any person who have already circumcized, or may in the future circumcise, their kids.  I didn't really see how his interpretation would have more validity than mine.<br>
<br>
Also, the whole issue of which translation he's using, etc. etc. Do you know if any deeper research has been done on the verses he quotes?<br>
<br>
He also talks about the Jewish &quot;intactivists&quot; (cute name), but this is the first time I've heard of that -- hey, Stacey, have you heard anything about this? I find it interesting that he equates this with the punishment of stoning.. I'm even more sketchy on Jewish theology than I am on Christian, so I'd have to research that more. <br>
<br>
On a totally different, yet related, topic, have you read the studies that suggest that circumcision has an effect in reducing AIDS in Africa?  I've seen some articles pro and con, but I thought it was interesting that these studies had been done.<br>
<br>
Thanks for sticking with the topic!<br>

We are not going to be able to agree on this.  You have your position, I am not going to be able to change it.  I have my position, and you won't be able to change it.  You dismiss my condition set and, as many anti-circ people are wont to do, make a mountain out of a foreskin.  Were it not for my familiy history, I would not have circed.  Even had I not circed, I still would not agree with the anti-circ camp of thought.  They just make far to big an issue over it.  I also never had an abortion, but do not agree with the pro-life camp and it's propaganda machine.  I see this dispute similarly. <p><br>

<br>
To be honest, I know nothing about this guy other than that I found that article today when I was running a search for commentaries about circumcision, so I have no ideas how he feels about the &quot;Christian Nation&quot; thing.  Personally I thought he was just trying to classify the groups that perform circumcision, not saying &quot;these are the religions that perform it&quot; but rather &quot;these are the groups of people who perform it.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I read though his biblical references.. now first, although I spent 12 years in Catholic school, I'm not really fluent on the bible, but I felt that some of his interpretations were questionable.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, we have something in common then.  I didn't go to Catholic school but I did attend LDS Seminary and, I'm sad to report, I too am not as fluent int he Bible as I should be <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   My own fault, but I'm trying to learn.  I could just kick myself for taking for granted all the educational opportunities I had when I was younger and not trying harder to understand and absorb.  Live and learn I guess.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I felt that some of his interpretations were questionable. For example, he quotes:<br>
<br>
&quot;Titus 1:10 For there are many rebellious people, idle-talkers, and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 1:11 who must be silenced because they mislead whole families by teaching for dishonest gain what ought not to be taught.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, to me this reads like a slam on Jewish people, but he interprets it as any person who have already circumcized, or may in the future circumcise, their kids. I didn't really see how his interpretation would have more validity than mine.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Well, seeing as how neither of us knows this man from Adam <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , I too think your interpretation is just as worthy of consideration as his.<br>
<br>
That said, I think what he was saying is that circumcision is certainly one of the things included in what Jewish people were being, as you put it, &quot;slammed&quot; for.  &quot;those fo the circumcision&quot; is a way of referencing Jewish people, and I can tell you that from what I have observed as far has human behaviour among those people who are from a &quot;circumcising&quot; culture, this is definately something that they want to hang on to and defend and many want to perpetuate, so I can see why the guy who wrote that article is seeing evidence in these scripture passages to the same thing having gone on back then.  I can see &quot;dishonest gain&quot; being both psychological comfort by defending something that has been done to themselves or they've done to someone else as well as the monitary gain from performing the procedure.  Again, I think what the guy is seeing in these scripture passages is that genital marking is quite likely at least a part of what is being talked about here.<br>

<br>
Nope.  That's the point where I am at myself in studying what translations say what and which one is most accurate, etc.  I mean, it's not like I'm completely ignorant about the Bible, but the things this guy was pointing out were an angle I'd never even thought to look at it from, and I thought it was fascinating.<br>
<br>

Hmmm.  Another good resource for me, I ought to look into what Jewish people who also believe that though the covenant is certainly real, the belief that God gave a requirement for genital cutting as a token of that covenant is actually a myth.  Sort of a &quot;duh, why didn't I already think of that&quot; moment there.  I knew there were Jewish people who were abandoning the practice, but I never thought that it might be because they believed it was never required by God in the first place.  Not to put words into anyone's mouth there, I'm not sure yet what the beliefs are about it...but that does appear to be what at least some people think.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I find it interesting that he equates this with the punishment of stoning.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I did too!  That was sort of an A-ha! moment for me.  The way he showed the pattern for how Jesus handled the situations and why (I never thought about the people could have become angered enough to turn the stones on Him too had he handled it in a less eloquent manner).  Let me tell you, as a person who has openly spoken out against circ, being verbally stoned for it is a pretty good description for what happens.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Perhaps I need to follow Jesus' example a little bit better in my approach? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I find it interesting that the studies have been done, too.  Quote from my earlier post:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I would ask whether or not it seems reasonable to gather a sample group of youg women and have their labia cut away (in clean conditions and with adequate anesthia even, which not all infant boys are given for circ here right now).

<br>
Seems like an absurd and even offensive proposal, yet that is what has been done with male circumcision. The only difference is that it was already going on. But if something isn't a good reason to start it, then is it a good excuse to continue it?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
First, I did not dismiss you condition set, I simply sought to clarify it.  Second, I'm not making a mountain out of a foreskin, I'm simply trying to make a foreskin out of a foreskin and not dismiss it as a vestigal tail or something that makes no difference one way or the other.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Kids waking up crying at night or unexpectedly throughout the day, ... Bleeding, infection, fear, embarrassment, nothing a new father wants to wait for his son to go through.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are right, it isn't.  That is exactly why I bother following through on debates like this.  The more people become aware of normal penile anatomy and how to treat it the fewer boys will go through things like that.  Also, about the embarrassment, why should a person have to be embarrassed about a medical condition?  It's all part of our society having so many psychological issues with our anatomy, especially genitals.  This is VERY much a part of why circumcision happens also.  It is interelated, so my bothering to debate this is my way of trying to accomplish the same end you were by having your son circumcized.  We just have differing ideas (for now, I'm holding out for you to convert <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) about which means is going to accomplish that end.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's see what we know:<br>
<br>
A)  They have Priapism (very painful condition where because of bloodflow issues prolonged erections are experienced <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) .  <br>
<br>
B)  The foreskin would not retract over the glans.  Tearing and scarring and infection were present.<br>
<br>
C)  The symptoms outlined in B are NOT symptoms of Priapism (I looked into this quite a bit by the way)<br>
<br>
D) Circumcision status does not effect priapism (again, of all the treatments mentioned in the medical literature I reveiwed, NONE mentioned circumcision nor can I see any logical reason to assume it would)  Which makes me wonder why, if your own son has priapism, he is not experiencing pain?  Is it possible priapism is not what runs in your family after all?  Just a thought.  You know better than I.<br>
<br>
E) The conditions outlined in B are also NOT part of the normal process of the seperation of the foreskin from the glans during maturation.<br>
<br>
F) Infants with intact foreskins that have not naturally seperated yet do have erections, and do not experience symptons outlined in B.<br>
<br>
So naturally you, DBC, &quot;avatar of reason&quot;, are asking me to conclude that there was no other condition present, and that circumcision is both the cure and the prevention?????????<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once again, I have no doubts that your nephews suffered horribly.  I have gone so far as to suggest a few things that it might be, what may have caused it, and what may have been a better way to prevent/treat it.  Not that I think I am some expert, but you don't seem to be forthcoming about an alternative explanation other than &quot;that's just what happens sometimes.&quot; My answer to that is that yes, it obviously does, but there are reasons, and if we want to debate whether circumcision was the answer (which is what you are asserting here, that sometimes it is) then we have to know what it is we are talking about.<br>
<br>
By the way, circumcision is possibly indicated in the case of one of the conditions I mentioned (BXO) so I'm not of the mindset that the foreskin is the one magical body part immune from never, ever being better off being amputated in case that is what you are thinking.  I just know that if this isn't clarified, this will become yet another anecdotal &quot;I heard about a guy whose nephew's had blah, blah, blah&quot; reason for circumcision to continue.<br>
