<br>
He set it down quietly on the counter. Trying to hide his old personality as Daniel started to laugh. His french accent ever so thick as he pointed at swven.<br>
<br>
&quot;When did you get to  be such a softy?!&quot; he questioned with a smile as swven turned with a glare. <br>
<br>
&quot;shut up.&quot; he said fixing his coat eyeing the black women strangely. He'd never seen someone so rambunctious. And terrifying, as the common human.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dilyan>Dilyan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/24/03 6:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:Jake Glenn</span><hr size=1> Dilyan gazed at Daniel.<br>

<br>
&quot;That's right boy! You done sit on my counters the last time!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mahrain and Caleb laughed, taken by a brotherly, or since mahrain is a girl, sibling, comradery.<br>
<br>
&quot;She told you count!&quot; Mahrain laughed.<br>
<br>
Shalel watched happily, then went over to check Jake's health. she was healer, a good one at that, but never before had she raised someone back to life. it was, well, almost unheard of. she'd never even been faced with that situation before.<br>
<br>
she had heard all the rumors, some could see angels after, while others, demons, or aura's or sense things unbelievably, and she was curious.<br>
<br>
being shalel, she got right to the point. &quot;So where did you get hurt? she asked.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alphakago>Alpha Kago</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/24/03 7:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/comics/lucifer.com/alpha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:Jake glenn</span><hr size=1> count was embarresed, which he hadnt been in ages.

<br>
&quot;There's no further use for me here.&quot; he said looking to count. &quot;I'm going back to the mansion.&quot; He turned to Mamah G grabbing his cape and bringing up for a bow &quot;Thank you for your hospitality.&quot; he said and dropped it for his exit as he headed for the doors. <br>
<br>
&quot;Poor sport.&quot; Danile called from the kitchen. The Count leaned on the wall collected and Calm, his face back to the ever clearer pale that it was when he first entered this little adventure. A cool breeze swept by Counts face... And his eyes shot open as he looked to daniel.<br>
<br>
It was a scent such a death that crept over him.. But it was not. <br>

Caleb looked over to Mahrain and took the piece of bread back, and took a bite.<br>
&quot;HEY!!&quot; She laughed.<br>
&quot;What...growing boys need food,&quot; He grinned. Mahrain stuck out her tongue and just took another piece off of the plate. Caleb laughed, and threw a piece at her. She looked at him shocked.<br>
&quot;Why Caleb...I'm appalled!!&quot; She laughed and threw the piece back. Caleb stood up.<br>
&quot;Oh...you want to play huh?&quot; Caleb grinned. Mahrain stood up too, grinning her head off.<br>
&quot;Yea I do.&quot; Caleb put the plate in the middle of table. Count looked to Swven.<br>
'If what I think is about to happen, Mamah G is going to have a heart attack.' Daniel picked up on the thought and grinned. <br>
&quot;Ready,&quot; Caleb smiled.<br>
&quot;Set,&quot; Mahrain, flexed her fingers.<br>
&quot;GO!!&quot; they said, and started attacking each other with the food. <br>

Counts folded arms tightened a bit. the grip on himself was kind of weird like he was scared. He ignored Mahrains concern and then saw a flash in his mind and sundenly looked like he had a headache. A white face, glossed over marble eyes.<br>

His head turned down and he was looking at the floor before his eyes were closed. Choir music of the devil rang in his mind and he thought that others could hear it as well. Although, he wasnt SURE that others could hear it. It's slow resonence crept up his back like someons hand tracing up it. <br>

Daniel looked at count and got a sense of the deep dark aura that the count was feeling but stayed quiet. and he too looked to mahrain.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=digitalv7>DigitalV7</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.silentangel.net/images/Majic%20Jin%20picture%20iconv2%20trans.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/24/03 10:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=112>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:Jake Glenn</span><hr size=1> Amanda looked at the count worried. &quot;Then we've got to go find him!&quot; <br>

How was she supposed to know? the most she could do was see minimal auras! <br>
<br>
Count looked a little angry, but she tried not to take it to heart *whatever* She thought as she, Shalel, Leslie and Amanda rose to travel down the tunnels.<br>
<br>
SHalel lead, her abilities far outstripping those who followed. <br>
<br>
She lead them down a twisty path, dark and black so all they had to follow was her voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're getting close,&quot; She said to the rest. She could see him in her witch sense and ran quickly towards him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jake!&quot; She called, trying to get him to slow down.<br>
<br>
he turned as though he had heard something, then continued on, like maybe he hadn't just his mind playing tricks on him.<br>
<br>
back in the kitchen, Solomon was giving count a detailed account of why he should not speak to mahrain as though she had done something wrong.<br>
<br>
He told count the extent of her powers (not too much) and her great loyalty to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I despise to see one of my people so badly treated. She's an integral member of the team, and just because you feel everything has a darker purpose doesn't mean its true. That's why the network was started. I've known mahrain since she was seventeen, never once has she shirked her duties, but more often gone out of her way to help, risking her life for some anonymous person more times than I care to count! Just because your connection with hell is stronger than mine doesn't mean that I don't have a connection with heaven. You should know that...I don't appreciate your silent accusation, and neither did Mahrain. She tries, she has dealt with so much evil, some times she thinks she losses herself in it. did you know that? did you know her only living relation has been trying to kill her since they first met? did you know that she lost both parents in cruel, brutal attacks? I didn't think so,&quot; He spat.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are friends, old friends. I would have thought you knew the extent of my judge of character.&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned away then, regretting somethings, and trying very hard not to say more. Count and Solomon had been friends for some time, but they had parted for quite a while, after scarlet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theotherophelia>TheOtherOphelia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/24/03 10:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=114>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ooc</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;OOC: Mahrain isn't evil<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . read the bio, I purposely made her darker than the others but she's not evil. &gt;&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alphakago>Alpha Kago</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/24/03 10:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=115>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/comics/lucifer.com/alpha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:Jake Glenn</span><hr size=1> Count put a hand on his shoulder, very softly.&quot;I'm sorry solomon.... &quot; He said that's all he could say. &quot;It pains me to feel something so dark. You know that, I cant help but take it in so it doesnt hurt anyone else.. as it would,&quot;<br>
Count tightened his grip on solomon's shoulder hopping that he would understand. <br>
<br>
&quot;I shouldn't have been so careless with words.&quot;<br>

We're not so safe as we thought here.&quot; He sighed, and sat down on the counter, but as Mamah G's favorite, she overlooked it.<br>
<br>
&quot;MAhrain's not dark, she's hurt, and make no mistake, I've screened all my people's auras, but I make acceptions to some, like your boy Danny, who is no fledgeling white, as you yourself are not either.&quot; He sighed again, running his hand through his ever messy hair.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's hard to explain. Have you ever heard the song Dark Horse by Amanda Marshall?&quot; Solomon asked, wishing desperately he had.<br>
<br>
after no sudden respose he continued. &quot;It's about a couple who kept on being told their never going to make it, and how their love is like a dark horse, you might not be able to see what it's colors are from far away, but you know you got to take the chance and get closer, and when you do, you see it's a rainbow, not just blackness.&quot; He groaned.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is stupid. I can't explain it. She's got a part to play, a big part, but if you never give her that chance you'll never know how capable she is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mamah G nodded. &quot;Boy be right. that girl is one in a million, and he done take to her first time he saw her, he's been like a brother to her.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theotherophelia>TheOtherOphelia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/24/03 11:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=117>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> another ooc</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;OOC:Kay guys, got to get some sleep...&gt;&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alphakago>Alpha Kago</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/25/03 12:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm75.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=118>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/comics/lucifer.com/alpha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: another ooc</span><hr size=1> The count looked in pity for the old friend of his...

He leaned on the counter Next to where Solomon sat. hands in front of him crossed and his own fingers intertwined with eachother.<br>
<br>
His thin black hair fell in his face, as if to cover something of shame. &quot;I never said she was dark, it's the something that's coming. I felt it enter my own soul... as if it was trying to take over... like that 1 time... remember?&quot; <br>
<br>
ooc- making up crap but go along w/ it ^.^ so county had a crush on solomon back in the day Oo;<br>
<br>
incharacter-<br>
&quot;I'm sorry if I trouble you all.&quot; he said quietly looking at the floor. Daniel was no where to be found. Swven had gone back to the Mansion. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm very grate full that you put up with me.... If I havent told you this before.&quot; Which he had when the count was some hundred years younger....<br>

He walked back out towards the entrance of the cave as it started to pour. Lightning crashed down from the sky and the rain thundered against the dirt. He smiled. The rain always did calm him down. He sat down on a rock that was flat on the top, and swung his feet in rythym with the rain. Caleb sat back and closed his eyes. He could still hear the voices in the back of his head, but they were faint, but he knew they'd come back twice as loud as today. He looked up to see another lightning flash and grinned. Lightning was the coolest thing on earth period. He felt the glow coming to his eyes...but this one didn't bring pain. He raised his hand and a little light ball rolled up. He smiled, and played with it a little, bouncing it around on both hands, and bouncing it on the walls,<br>
&quot;I love light energy.&quot; He smiled, and then winced as Mamah G ran down the hallway...<br>
&quot;BOY!! you done messed up my clean kitchen!!&quot;<br>
