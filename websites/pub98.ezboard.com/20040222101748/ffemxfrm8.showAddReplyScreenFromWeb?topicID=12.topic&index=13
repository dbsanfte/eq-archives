Morning <br>
<br>
     Ororo woke with the dawn.<br>
<br>
     It was her habit.  Outside, the sky was still dark, not yet tinged with that faint and deep, becoming blue that most people would call morning at its earliest.  She knew better, could feel it in the proud blood and fine strong flesh of her, feel the tilting of the earth, the expectant trembling of the plants, the water, the ground, the sky.  She met it when she could, witness to the waking of the earth, to greet the new sun.  It was a ritual of which she did not tire; Ororo did not often stay long abed.<br>
<br>
     This morning was different.  Memories came to her like sweet raindrops, and she sighed blissfully. Ororo stretched the lithe muscles of her supple arms, the long clean line of her neck, and stilled so as not to wake the other.<br>
<br>
     Brushing the silver fall of her hair from bare, dark shoulders, the mutant Storm looked down at the woman who nestled, still sleeping, in the soft, expansive comforters beside her.  The living warmth of a heartbeat called to her, gently as the sunrise.  Eyes that had begun to take the wild, excited cast of a building storm softened, and her lips curved.<br>
<br>
     Ororo lifted her long fingers and almost touched that sleeping face: almost.  Skin pale as porcelain, hair dark as a rook’s wing, a heavy, gleaming blackness spread wanton across the pillows.  Storm lowered her fingertips to the soft edge, stroked it carefully as she savored the sight of the other.  In all her years of knowing her, Ororo could not remember having seen that hair entirely loosed---always, she kept it in its complex and elegant coif, yet, ever practical creature that she was, she had not cut it.<br>
<br>
    Storm remembered the feel of it beneath her fingertips the night before, as, endlessly patient, she had found the tricks and catches to the style.  At last, Ororo had finally undone it---saw then the flash of defiance, of anxiety in the great cerulean eyes her teammate hid so often, hid behind the uplink glasses, the computerized omniscience of Sage.  Felt the most minute of tremors as she brushed so lightly the high plane of that pale cheek.  Saw the capitulation, visible decision in those deep eyes, the gift of her submission, her trust.  Taking from Sage the teasing scraps of her clothing had been nothing to the initial freeing of that hair.<br>
<br>
     Asleep, she looked both younger and older.  There was not the mask, the chill and uninviting calm that Sage habitually offered to the world:  so trained she was, so controlled and austere that she had learned finally to show nothing, to give nothing, even, perhaps, to feel nothing when it would most protect her.  Trained too well, she had been, and used too harshly.  That perfect mask that let her be the fabulously competent thing she was, that let her deny the deeper pain beneath and so worsened it, was mostly gone when she slept.  Without it, there was an unconscious sweetness to her noble features, something rarely glimpsed that Storm had seen most recently...last night.<br>
<br>
    But there was weariness there as well, the nascent sorrow which she also hid, plain on her vulnerable face as the clean, sharp lines of the tattoos which angled down her cheekbones like the edged groove of tears.  Breath hissed softly between Ororo’s teeth.  She was so beautiful.<br>
<br>
    When had she made the decision, Storm wondered, become aware that she would do this thing, try and break this one’s defenses?  As early as Spain?  Before she had brought together this team, even?  Ororo was not entirely certain; only that, some time after this most recent alien invasion, Bishop had come to her a little uneasily.  “She cares for you, you know,” the big mutant had told her, obviously uncomfortable with the topic but finding it too important to leave alone.  “I never would have guessed, but she does.”  Storm had nodded, and thanked him, and known.  And had not been surprised, not even that Sage had let their teammate see it.<br>
<br>
    The weight and intensity of Ororo’s gaze was too much---Sage’s throat moved minutely, and her shoulders shifted, and then she stilled entirely as her eyes flickered open.  Ororo leaned above her, felt her heartbeat quicken, as for the first time fear touched her like the taste of sleet.<br>
<br>
     Had this been too much, too soon?  Would she run?  Close herself, hide herself away?  On instinct, Sage reached for her glasses, but Ororo had removed them to a higher shelf.  They were left with each other and, locked into Ororo’s gaze, Sage did not know what to say.<br>
<br>
     It was as great a moment between them as the first careful touching of lips, as the heat which had risen mad as the Phoenix from the shreds of that cold and brittle resolve.  Greater: for by the time Storm had led her to this quiet corner bedroom of Rogue’s home, the game had been won, the other’s capitulation obtained.  It had been a long and subtle hunt, through the lengthy evening of dinner and talk, for Storm, looking upon Sage, had made her decision, and Sage, being Sage, had understood this, knew immediately.  But there was a gap, such a gap, between knowledge and meaning.  The living computer they called her, and perhaps there was some truth to it, but Sage was no machine.  She was tender as anyone in the face of possibility.<br>
<br>
     That briefest flash of vulnerability, unsurety, even fear, had taken Ororo’s breath even as the pain in it broke something within her:  for they all bore scars, her team, but none more so or more deeply than Sage, and Sage was not comfortable with what she wanted.  Perhaps, given what she had once been, her place at Hellfire, she was not entirely comfortable wanting anyone.  It had seemed at times almost cruel to press her.  But there had been the sick longing, so brutally quashed, the need she had glimpsed...and more than that.  So, patient, Ororo had pursued.  All of this had been gleaned in whispers of movement, the gesture of a hand on a cup, the tightening of porcelain skin around eyes she hid:  Sage was a subtle woman.  None of the others had even guessed at the dance between them.  <br>
<br>
    Was the tangled mess of Sage, the yawning gulf beneath that cold mask,  something she truly wanted to tackle?  It was a task of such magnitude, and Storm bore her own ghosts.<br>
<br>
      Looking down into those depthless eyes, there was no question, no question at all.  There was something like shock in Sage’s expression, something like disbelief, almost fear.  That she should have let herself know the sweetness that had been, or that she should lose it?<br>
<br>
     Ororo remembered those strong hands upon her body, the small insistent nips tracing the line of her collarbone, lower.  Sage’s tiny gasp as Ororo had reached for her, the fierce and needful passion, the...skill.  Ororo almost blushed, remembering.  And saw the chill distance bleed back into those eyes,  the mechanical quiet return to her still naked body, Tessa retreating to the safety of Sage.<br>
<br>
    “No,” Storm whispered, command more than plea, but both were there as she reached for the other, cupped the delicate point of her chin.  “Don’t.  Don’t be Sage just yet.  Stay with me.”<br>
<br>
     Still she said nothing, and the air itself seemed to hold its breath as emotions that this one professed not to feel flickered across that pale, still face.  Don’t.  Don’t you leave me, don’t you hide.  Ororo felt the seed of a hurricane gather in her eyes.<br>
<br>
     She held her, carefully drew her thumb down the sharp black line of the tattoo, leaned forward and down.  Silver hair caressed the strong, bare shoulders as their lips touched, soft, gentle.  Sage was stiff at first, and Ororo feared that she had lost her, that with the dawn she would leave, could not ultimately bear the intimacy which gave lie to her coldness, would flee forever that thing Storm had seen like a wound in her unfettered eyes.  Felt her give, then, felt the skin shudder and the heartbeat she controlled as thoroughly as any machine increase in tempo despite itself.  Felt the other woman melt suddenly, offer herself to the kiss.<br>
<br>
     When Storm pulled away, the coldness was gone, and Sage’s expression could not be read.<br>
<br>
     “You don’t need to run like that,” Ororo whispered, smoothing the dark and unkempt locks, fighting to keep her voice steady, pierced with a sorrow that anything should have put such shadows in this woman’s eyes.  “I didn’t want you just for the night, you know. I...understand.”  It was too early, far too early to say the word, ‘love.’<br>
<br>
     But Sage was the synthesizer, and the power of that mind was still at work, even now.  Ororo could see the meaning of the words settle, see that Sage saw what was given, the meanings that Ororo did not know yet quite how to frame.<br>
<br>
      She smiled, then, just a little, tentative, almost shy.  The strong and graceful hand rose to Storm’s cheek, brushed across coffee skin.  There was again the boldness to her expression, Sage the indomitable who would give anything, absolutely anything, for her friends and her cause.  Who had already given too much.  Who saw now in the compassion and desire of Ororo that some, at least, saw her as far more than merely a brilliant tool.<br>
<br>
      Storm placed her hand over the other’s and pulled her close.  Sage’s skin against her own was hot and inviting, the pulse like a trapped thing, her giving softness, her trust, unspeakably precious.  Was this woman and what she represented not, ultimately, what Ororo fought so hard for?<br>
<br>
      In the growing half-light of the still and quiet room, they held one another for some time.<br>
<br>
     “It’s getting late,”  Storm murmured finally into the sweet fragrance of her lover’s heavy black hair.  “Outside, the sun will just be touching the garden.  There will be a mist a few hundred feet off the ground, but the light will burn it off, and it will feel wonderful, coming off of us.  From that height, you can see the whole Earth waking.  It will be beautiful.  Will you come with me?”<br>
<br>
     Sage pulled away a little, stared up searchingly into the other’s honest gaze.  At last, she reached up, so lightly to touch her lips against Ororo’s.<br>
<br>
     “I’d like that,” she whispered, her voice a little rough.<br>
<br>
     Storm nodded and rose gracefully, taking the other’s hand, lifted her from the bed.  For a moment, they stared at one another, and Ororo smiled suddenly, bright and hopeful.  Sage’s eyes, her tiny smile, gave it reflection, and carefully, she took Ororo’s hand, let the taller woman lead her into the garden.  Together, they padded out to meet the coming day.<br>
<br>
