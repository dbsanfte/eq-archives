<br>
Bitter snow, cold and sharp, blew under the cowl of his cloak, threatening to unglue the bushy mustache he had on his face. Thankfully, his fake beard was tucked beneath his heavy furs and was safe. Although of slim built, Ilsamore had managed to hide his size under mounds of furs and a few well placed mind-illusions completed the disguise. Anyone seeing him would have an image implanted in his mind, that of a burly norseman who's gruff appearance showed he was not to be bothered. At least Ilsamore hoped that his illusion would stick. He knew a bit of Midgardian, not enough to be fluent but enough to get by. That too, was a hope. <br>
<br>
A nagging voice in his mind told him this was folly, that venturing into an enemy realm, to find information on the whereabouts of his love's mother was foolish. He would surely get himself killed. And if the mids did not do it, the snow would be happy to oblige. As always Ilsamore shut out the voice and his legs plodded on. <br>
<br>
He was somewhere in the frontier lands, the snowstorm blurring everything more than ten feet away. He nearly cried out in surprise, breaking his disguise, when a form came out of the storm in front of him, large axe at the ready. <br>
<br>
&quot;What are yer about?&quot; The shape said. Ilsamore shielded his eyes from the storm and noticed it was a norseman, dressed in the uniform of a frontier guard captain. Just then, the winds died down for only a few seconds and he saw it. Like a wolf waiting to pounce on an easy kill; a large stone keep tucked between the rocky walls of a valley. This must be the frontier gate of the realm of Midgard, he thought. Thankful that the storm was helping him with his disguise and hoping his illusion would hold, he addressed the guard. <br>
<br>
&quot;bah git outta me way&quot; he grumbled in his best norseman voice. He was hoping to fool the guard with open confidence. Ilsamore wondered if the cold sweat he felt was due to the furs and the snow or his own nervousness. The guard bristled at his tone and narrowed his eyes. The guard took a step towards him, axe at the ready. Ilsamore thought his doom was at hand when the guard suddenly pushed him aside and stepped past him. <br>
Ilsamore blew a sigh of relief and trudged towards the keep gates without looking back. He heard the guard talking to a group of mids that had come up behind him. Thankful for the distraction, Ilsamore strode past a few more guards who were too busy shielding themselves from the storm than to check on travellers that had already been questioned by their captain. <br>
<br>
Ilsamore, a million plans forming in his mind and a million doubts to accompany them passed quickly under the gates of Svasud Faste and into the Wolf's Den. <br>

He found a road leading away from the keep and, having no other better plan decided to follow it. <br>
<br>
The storm eased up some time later, giving him a better view of the land around him. He could not deny the beauty of the land about him. The tall mountain peaks and snow-covered pines. But this was the realm of the enemy and every living being here would gladly slay him on sight. The elf plodded on in the waist deep snow for what seemed like days on end until he saw, up ahead in the dark of night the shimmering of lights. He must be approaching a village, he thought and made sure his disguise was still as it should be. A small sign outside the village marked the place as Hugginfell. He could make out a few huts set in a circle. Two troll guards stood lazily beside the entrance to the village and paid him no heed at all as he made his way in. The wind was still blowing, though it was finally relenting. The mentalist found what seemed to make up the village tavern and strode towards the door. If he was to get some information, this would be a good place to start. <br>

But by then a large pile of snow had blown in and a good number of patrons, all grim faced and scowling, were staring at him. Ilsamore grumbled something about storms and waddled on towards the bar. The inn wasn't very full, but there were still about a half dozen mids there, four of them trolls who were already quite drunk and laughing heartily about some joke they had just shared. The other two, a dwarf and a norseman were picking up their game of cards that had been blown to the floor with Ilsamore's entry. Behind the bar, standing on a stool was a kobold. He glared a bit at Ilsamore but managed a smile when the elf dropped a small pouch of gold coins on the bar. <br>
&quot;What juse want?&quot; the kobold asked, reaching under the bar for a bottle of grog. Im fact, all he and was grog and any demand for something else was met with a scowl and a bottle of grog. Ilsamore merely grunted and accepted what the kobold gave him. Then, summoning up his courage, he tried to get some information out of the kobold. His disguise seemed to work and that bolstered his confidence. <br>
&quot;I wants some information&quot; the elf began. His heart skipped a beat when he forgot to say the &quot;for&quot; as &quot;fer&quot;, his accent evident to the now weary kobold who narrowed his eyes. But the blue creature did not press the point and only asked &quot;what kind infermation juse wants?&quot;. The kobold held out his hand, expectantly. Ilsamore sighed inwardly and fetched another pouch of gold. The kobold immediatly opened the pouch and dropped the coins in his hands, biting each one to test its make. &quot;I needs infermation on...&quot; Ilsamore panicked then, he could not remember the words he needed! <br>
&quot;On wha?&quot; the grimy kobold asked. <br>
&quot;infermation&quot; Ilsamore stated, trying to gain some time to think. <br>
&quot;Infermation on infermation?&quot; the kobold said and his frown was deeper now. <br>
&quot;Ggorolut&quot; Ilsamore blurted out. It was the name of the troll that had kidnapped Ilsamore's mother so many years ago. A name he had extracted out of the kobold slave the troll had kept and to whom he had given Tshaya as a pleasure slave. <br>
The kobold barkeep's eyes grew wide with fright. Ggorolut was obviously known to him and Ilsamore thought himself quite clever. <br>
That is until he noticed that the common room behind him was now very quiet... <br>

The four trolls were in front of him, faces locked in frowns of anger. The norseman and dwarf were on their feet as well, but giving the trolls ample room. <br>
&quot;What juse wants wit Ggorolut?&quot; the bigger of the trolls asked, the big club resting on hsi shoulder prompting a quick answer from the &quot;norseman&quot; dressed in think furs. <br>
Ilsamore's mind was racing to find a way out of this. He said the first thing that came to mind. <br>
&quot;Ggorolut's owin me and im lookin to get 'im to repay mes&quot; he said. His plan was becoming clearer now. He would find this Ggorolut, figure out a way to make him hand over Tshaya, or tell him where she was and all he would have to do then would be to walk out of the gates, the same way he had come in, with Siofra's mother in tow. <br>
He had not counted on Ggorolut being the troll in front of him though. <br>
&quot;Who are juse?&quot; the troll asked and reached to remove the furs covering Ilsamore. The elf, knowing that those furs were essential to his disguise tried to dodge out of the way, but the trolls flanking Ggorolut moved forward and grabbed him by the arms, pinning him to the bar. <br>
Ggorolut pulled off the furs, cancelling the mind spell and thus, removing the disguise. <br>
Ilsamore, determined to die honorable looked with defiance at the troll. <br>
The large monster's expression of surprise turned to one of rage and the last thing Ilsamore saw was a grey fist, easily as large as his head coming in fast. <br>
<br>
Everything went black and Ilsamore knew no more. <br>

He was tied at the wrists with heavy shackles and hung from the ceiling of a large wooden hut. His left eye was swollen shut and he could barely see through the other. Blood oozed out of a large cut in his forehead and Ilsamore had to blink continuously to prevent the blood from covering his right eye. <br>
Then, of course, there was the cold. Ilsamore was naked from the waist up and his thin cloth pants did not stop the cold from freezing him to the marrow of his bones. He could no feel his legs but he considered that a blessing. <br>
There were three trolls in the room with him, including Ggorolut. They were talking among themselves in hushed tones, one of them occasionaly grinning his way. Ilsamore closed his eyes and thought of Siofra, hoping that the memories he had of her would manage to free him from his torment. Ilsamore closed his senses and let his mind wander to her. <br>
<br>
He could hear her soft voice, fell the warmth of her breath on his neck. <br>
<br>
That was when a large fist struck him hard in the belly, knocking the air out of him and bringing him sharply back to reality. <br>
<br>
The trolls, apparently having noticed that Ilsamore had found a way to escape their torment had rushed to him and started hammering him with their huge fists. <br>
The elf accepted blow after blow. He heard as much as felt some of his ribs crack and his jaw was dislocated when Ggorolut smacked with his forehead, both hands holding tightly to his shoulders. <br>
<br>
Until then he had managed to not cry out, to not give his captors the satisfaction of knowing they had broken him. <br>
<br>
But they the Ggorolut used a serrated hunting knife and carved his name in the frozen flesh of his thigh. <br>
<br>
Ilsamore screamed. <br>

<br>
But the trolls were not done with him. <br>
<br>
Cold liquid was splashed on Ilsamore. It smelled of urine. The elf tried to spit out some of the awful that had gotten into his mouth stuff but only managed a ragged cough. His &quot;good&quot; eye opened halfway and he looked at his tormentor, wondering what new torture the troll had devised and hoping that it would prove fatal. <br>
<br>
But the troll was not done with him. <br>
<br>
Ggorolut was accompanied by a norse woman, she looked even more cruel than the troll, a fact made even more obvious by the number of metal prods and knives she removed from a leather bag she carried. <br>
<br>
Ggorolut smiled from ear to ear and opened the cover from a brazier that stood before him. Red hot coals glowed within and the woman did not delay in putting her metal tools into those coals. <br>
<br>
Ilsamore looked at them with his good eye. Ggorolut apparently noticed the scrutiny and did not like it for he growled menacingly and approached him in two long strides. He slugged the elf in the eye and grinned at his own superiority. <br>
<br>
Ilsamore was able to open his eye just in time to see the woman come towards him with a long knife, its blade glowing red in the dim light of the hut. <br>
<br>
Ilsamore fainted. <br>

It took a moment for her eyes to adjust to the gloomy interior after walking through the brightness of the snow. Uncontiously she hunched beneath her furs as Mogor towered above her. A scrawny, scarred kobold rushed forward upon seeing Siofra and Mogor enter.<br>
&quot;What juse want? Masta busy. No want visters.&quot; The kobold made shooing motions with its hands trying to usher them back out the door. Mogor just remained where he was looking at the kobold slave in distaste.<br>
&quot;Tells Ggorolut dat Mogor be here te see im.&quot;  The kobold was going to argue until it saw the look on Mogor's face. Quickly it rushed off to the adjoining room. As the kobold disappeared Mogor stepped forward so he was in front of Siofra. Her eyes took in the detail of the room and she shuddered. Axes and blades were displayed on all of the walls. Many still bore traces of dried blood. On one wall was a badly drawn and barely identifiable sketch of an elf., the throwing knives still stuck into it at odd angles. Mugs lay scattered about the tables and floor. The building stank of ale and death. <br>
<br>
The furs across the dorrway where the kobold disappeared opened and out stepped the biggest troll Siofra had ever seen.  He radiated brute force, his face set in a scowl.  Upon seeing Mogor, Ggorolut's face shifted slightly into what Siofra assumed was a smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mogor ole frend. Wha' juse doin here?&quot; Ggorolut stepped forward and clapped a large hand on Mogor's shoulder. <br>
<br>
&quot;And wha do we ave ere?&quot; Siofra started as a norsewoman seemingly appeared out of nowhere in front of her. Siofra thought the woman's beauty similar to the night. Beautiful and appealing in its own way yet full of hidden dangers. Mogor pulled on the rope that bound Siofra's hands so she stepped forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ello Eyverska. I's foun er when I was patrollin las eve. Tot juse mite like er. Juse got an eye fer da beauties after all.&quot;  Ggorolut's eyes roamed over Siofra.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, juse knows me well friend,&quot; he said sounding pleased.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well let's ave us a look ere, shall we?&quot; Eyverska said stepping closer to Siofra. Before Siofra could react the woman pulled the furs off her shoulders and down her arms, leaving them rumpled above her bound hands.  She looked Siofra up and down, her eyes glowing.  <br>
<br>
&quot;A gypsy ey? Wha a pleasan suprise,&quot; she purred. &quot;Yer nicely shaped too.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that one of the woman's hands shot out and clamped on one of Siofra's breasts.  Siofra gasped and her eyes went wide as she tried to step back. Eyverska's eyes narrowed and she stepped so close that Siofra could feel the woman's breath on her face. Eyverska reached up with her free hand and grabbed a handful of hair at the back of Siofra's head.  Thankfully Siofra's hair was weaved tight enough that her ears stayed hidden.  With a grin Eyverska pulled on Siofra's hair so that she was faced to look up at the norsewoman. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ye don' like dat ay? Well wha bout dis?&quot; With that Eyverska bent forward and planted her lips on Siofra's. Forcefully her tongue found its way into Siofra's mouth. As it was removed, Siofra clamped her teeth down on the woman's lip.  A hard fist across her face was her reward for her action. Siofra's green eyes met Eyverska's in defiance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fiesty too,&quot; she said touching a finger to her bloodied lip. With a grin she turned to Ggorolut. &quot;Can I ave er m'lord? Teach er some manners fittin of yer house.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ggorolut watched the whole proceedings with an amused grin on his stoney face. <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye ye can ave er. Play nice wit yer new toy.  Bu first I wants te see er dance.&quot;<br>

Siofra silently breathed a sigh of relief. It would do no good for them to realize she hadn't even been bound properly. Siofra rubbed her wrists as if easing away the pain from chafing ropes.   Eyverska Grabbed Siofra's hair once again and shoved her farther into the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye heard wha Ggorolut said. Dance.&quot; Siofra took a few steps farther into the room and paled as Ggorolut's buddies came out of the adjoining room.  She forced herself to keep her eyes from going to Mogor.  She didn't know if he was going to stay or not.  Either way, he had done his job and if she got the chance she would thank him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Lookie ere boys, we gots sum enertainment t'nite. We can lea our odder game fer lata.&quot; Ggorolut's rumbling voice caused goosebumps to form on Siofra's arms.  The entertainment he was talking about had to be Ilsamore, she thought.  Just hold out a bit more, she prayed.  With a deep breathe she ignored the taunting catcalls from Ggorolut's buddies and began to dance. Much to the surprise of em all she also began to sing.  I'm here for you Ilsa, she thought.<br>

And on your grave the mossy grass is green,<br>
I stand, do you behold me listening hear?<br>
Hearing your voice through all the years between. <br>
I hear you calling me. <br>

The evening went on and on.  Ggorolut, Eyverska and their buddies drank and gossiped merrily as she danced and sang. Their leering gazes towards her made Siofra's skin crawl. The worst however was Eyverska's. The woman just set her on edge.  Eventually her audience had passed out from their ale and lay sprawled around the room. A hand on her shoulder made her jump.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time fer bed,&quot; Eyverska murmered. Siofra had to suppress the shiver of revulsion she felt as she saw the grin on the woman's face.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vestachasiofra>VestachaSiofra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beloved lil Elf</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/13/03 9:22:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Into the Wolf's Den</span><hr size=1> &lt;by Ilsamore&gt;<br>
<br>
From within a cold dark haze Ilsamore thought he heard Siofra's voice. But his mind and body were too battered to register the very real fact that it was indeed Siofra's voice he had heard. He surmised that it was his mind trying to free itself from the horrors of the place and, logically, it was reliving moments with Siofra. <br>
Ilsamore's head fell back down heavily and he drifted into unconsciousness again. <br>

Eyverska wasn't about to let Siofra sleep. It was her time to play with her new toy. Eyverska's room looked more like a torture chamber than a sleep chamber.  The woman shoved Siofra roughly onto the bed and her wrists were attached to ropes on the wall.  Siofra could only sit there as the woman extinguished all the lamps but one and began to undress. She glared at Eyverska in defiance as the woman slipped onto the bed and moved towards her like a cat. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now, now me pet. Dat's no way te look at yer mistress.&quot; Eyverska reached for the edge of Siofra's skirts. Siofra's whipped a foot out and she silently cheered in satisfaction as it met with the woman's chin. The blow barely phased the woman. Slowly a predatory grin crossed her face. &quot;Aye, I's gunna ave sum fun wit juse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Siofra had no way of knowing how much time had gone by as her body was used and abused.  Her clothing had been removed and thrown in a pile across the room. Luckily Eyverska had been in too much of a hurry and had not discovered the weapons and items hidden within the skirts and the tunic.  Siofra's mouth still tasted of blood from where she had bit her cheeks to prevent from crying out and her face burned from where she was hit more than once for less than satisfactory responses to her &quot;mistress's&quot; administrations. <br>
<br>
Now all was quiet. Eyverska lay on the bed snoring slightly, tired out from her &quot;lessons&quot;. Siofra moved her wrists around, feeling the heat of the rope burn on them. Throughout all that had happened Eyverska had left her tightly bound.  She shifted on the bed slightly to verify that the woman was really asleep. Satisfied that Eyverska wouldn't wake up Siofra began her escape.<br>
Gypsies were known for their skills at song and dance.  But they were also well known for their thievery and escapes. Siofra may have been stripped to nothing but she was not left without a weapon.  Turning her head to the side she tipped it back so it was within reach of her fingers. Carefully she pulled out the hairpiece that held her weaved hair in place. Her dark hair fell around her bare shoulders as the slim blade glinted in the faint light of the room. Slowly she worked the blade against the ropes binding her wrist. As soon as one was free she began working on the other.  Every muscle screamed at her each time she moved but she swallowed the pain and focused on her task. <br>
<br>
Finally the last of the ropes broke free.  To Siofra's horror one of the pieces fell onto the sleeping norsewoman. Eyverska rolled over, confusion marring her still sleep-filled features. Immediately Siofra was on top of her pinning her. She grabbed a pillow and quickly covered the woman's face to muffle any screams before she buried her small weapon in the woman's throat.  Siofra held the pillow in place until the thrashing stopped. Even then she remained where she was, listening for any movement within the house which signaled that the struggle had been heard.  After a time, when nothing was heard, Siofra rolled from the corpse and off the bed. She stumbled as she stood. Ignoring the pain and the blood which began to flow down her inner leg she made her way to where her clothing lay and dressed.  <br>
<br>
Cautiously she opened the door and stepped into the other room.  Ggorolut and his cronies still slept heavily, their snores filling the room. It was fortunate they had drank so much before passing out. Slowly she went around the room and stuck her blades within each throat as they slept.  Her one bit of satisfaction was seeing Ggorolut's eyes open and go wide upon seeing her blade above his throat.  The further shock on his face as her pointed ears came into sight When each of the beasts had been dealt with she slowly crossed to the door leading to the other room. Lifting the furs aside she looked in and had to fight down her stomachs urge to release its contents.<br>
<br>
Ilsamore hung from the ceiling, his body a bruised and bloody mess. In the dark it was hard to see the extent of his injuries but she knew it wasn't good. She rushed into the room and found where the ropes were secured. She cut the knot and slowly lowered his battered form to the floor.  Within a few steps she had his head cradled in her lap.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wake up Ilsa. I wouldn't let ye leave me last time what thinks I'm going te let you this time.&quot; She dug a hand within one of the pouches on her skirt and pulled out a couple of vials. Uncorking the lids she tilted Ilsamore's head back and forced him to swallow the contents.  She hoped the potions would be enough to sustain him til more help could be had.  <br>
<br>
She had to get the both of them out of the house. Looking around the room she caught sight of a sled. With some manuvering she managed to get Ilsamore on top of it before covering him with heavy furs which she found in the next room. <br>
<br>
&quot;Be right back Ilsa,&quot; she murmered quietly and ran to check a door she remembered seeing within the norsewoman's room. Sure enough it led outside. Siofra was pleased to note that it led directly out of town and there were no guards in sight. Quickly she ran back to where Ilsamore lay and grabbed the ropes on the sled. She was covered in sweat by the time she managed to get the sled outside. One it's tracks hit the snow it moved much easier.  Looking about she could only think of one place to go and hoped she remembered the way. She slipped on the carved ring Ayslyn had given her hoping there might be some way she could get Ilsamore the help he needed faster. <br>
<br>
Luckily the night had been clear with only a small amount of light from the moon.  Every so often she would stop the sled and backtrack a ways to hide the sleds tracks. It would do no good to lead anyone back to Ayslyn's people.  <br>
<br>
Morning had come and Siofra was still dragging the sled behind her.  She was passing by another small town when two squealing children caught her eye. She couldn't put her finger on it but there was something different about them. <br>
<br>
&quot;Vesta'chas!&quot; Siofra's head qhipped around at the familiar word. At the sound of the voice the two children ran squealing into a house.  Siofra heart beat loudly and she was torn by her curiosity but her concern for Ilsamore pushed her onward. <br>
<br>
Eventually she made it back to the old woman's house and passed out as she knocked on the door. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vestachasiofra>VestachaSiofra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beloved lil Elf</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/15/03 7:44:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Into the Wolf's Den</span><hr size=1> Large, cool hands roamed gently across her fevered skin, washing away pain, and unbearable heat. Siofra slowly opened her eyes. A firbolg sat at the side of her bed, his eyes closed in suplication. His hands wandered up and down her body, healing her wounds. His eyes fluttered several times before finaly opening. He let out a sigh, &quot;Thank you Spirits for your aid.&quot; He smiled, warmly down at her. &quot;Welcome back,&quot; his voice was rich and deep, and it seemed to roll through her. &quot;You made it back just in time.&quot; She noticed the wind roaring outside like an angry beast. The firbold nodded, &quot;One of their blizzards. Striking and beautiful to see, snug in a warm house, but I would not want to be caught in one. How are you feeling?&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Siofra blinked trying to remember what had happened. Her eyes widened and she sat bolt upright. <br>
<br>
&quot;How's Ilsa? He's ok isn't he? Li'sa'eer by the highest gods how could they do that te him?&quot; Siofra's heart raced and panic threatened to take over. <br>
<br>
<br>
The firbolg's massive hand enfolded her shoulder, and he gently forced her back down. He calmly rearanged the furs on her before answering, &quot;He's as well as can be expected. He needs rest right now, and that is what he is getting. As for why,&quot; he shook his head slowly, &quot;I do not know why. Torture for pleasure has always baffled me. Now, you too need rest. Do not force me to call the Slumbering Spirit to give it too you.&quot; He smiled gently at her. <br>
<br>
<br>
Siofra pulled the furs up to her chin and forced herself to remain laying down. She tried to sleep but each time she closed her eyes she saw Ilsamore's mangled form and Eyverska's evil grin. The reality of what had happened to Ilsamore and herself sunk in and she curled herself into a ball and began to shiver uncontrollably. She could still feel the warmth of the blood on her hands and remember the cold joy she felt each time she buried her blade within a new throat. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Mogor left didn't he? He wasn't there?&quot; she asked the fibolg quietly.<br>
<br>
<br>
He nodded, &quot;He did. He was not there in the end. None that were there in the end were innocent. The all chose to follow a brutal and violent path.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Siofra nodded and curled up tighter under the blanket. She heard the firbolg walk towards the door. <br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe ye'd better call upon that Slumbering Spirit,&quot; she said quietly. She heard him begin a soft chant. Turning pleading eyes on him she said, &quot;And please. Don't tell Ilsamore what happened if he wakes?&quot; <br>
<br>
The firbolg's eyes were unreadable as he nodded and Siofra drifted to sleep.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vestachasiofra>VestachaSiofra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beloved lil Elf</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/15/03 7:45:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Into the Wolf's Den</span><hr size=1> Siofra slept through the rest of that day and well into the next. When she finally awoke it took her a while to remember where she was. Sitting up she let her eyes wander. Forcing down the thoughts that wanted to intrude she rose and looked for her clothing. Finding fresh clothing on a chair she quickly dressed and left her room. She had to find Ilsamore. <br>
<br>
She could hear voices outside the house and thougth she recognized them but none were the one she was hoping to hear. Ilsamore's room wasn't hard to find and she quickly stepped within the dark interior. <br>
<br>
Deja vu, she thought and moved to Ilsamore's bed. She couldn't help but cry as her eyes came to rest on his face. Most of the wounds had been healed but it was still slightly swollen and bruised. Blankets covered most of him so she couldn't see any of the other wounds. <br>
<br>
For the next three days Siofra never left his side. She wouldn't have even eaten anything if it weren't for the puncutal meals which were delivered to the room. <br>
<br>
On the fourth day, Siofra finally rose from her place and with a kiss to Ilsamore's brow, left the room. Wrapping her cloak about her shoulders and pulling the hood up she left the small house. She didn't know where she was going as her thoughts led her feet. She didn't want to pay attention to the thoughts within her head so instead focused on putting on foot in front of the other. The sound of sqealing children stilled her steps and she looked up at where the children she saw before played in front of one of the log houses. The frown creasing her brow eased as she watched htem play. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ye new te da area?&quot; Siofra jumped as the norseman appeared out of nowhere beside her. &quot;Sorry I startled ye.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It be ok. I wasn' payin attention.&quot; Siofra motioned towards the children with her chin. &quot;Who'r dey? Dey don' look mos norse.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Dat be cuz dey aren' yer evryday norse. Dose be da whelps of Vorsa. Ye really mus be new te da area if ye don' know dem. Dey be half-breeds. Der ma's an elf.&quot; Siofra tried to hide her interest as he continued to talk. &quot;Vorsa dun fell in luv wit one'a Ggorolut's slaves. She wa' jus a shell when Vorsa bot her from Ggorolut. Venchally she came round bu' she got no past. Members nuttin from fore Vorsa took er in.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well I best be gittin back te me work. Be well miss,&quot; he said and headed into town. <br>
<br>
Sifra stood at the edge of the woods up the hill from the cabin and watched the children play. They seemed so happy and carefree. <br>
<br>
Night had begun to fall when the door to the cabin opened. Siofra's heart stopped as a woman came to the doorway and called the children in. She pulled her hood down so she could get a better look at the woman. Tears began to run down Siofra's cheeks. There stood her Dya, alive and well. Siofra was about to head down and maybe speak with her when the woman's gaze seemed drawn to where she stood. For a moment time stopped. Siofra wished to be able to just run down and throw herself into her dya's arms. Instead she turned and ran in the opposite direction. <br>
<br>
*************************** <br>
<br>
&quot;Time te come in! Suppers ready!&quot; she called. The two sqealing children bowled past her with yelps of joy ito the house. She was about to close the door when something made her look up. In the half light she saw a woman standing up the hill, hair and cloak billowing in the wind. Time froze as her eyes met the other woman's. There was an odd sense of recognition. As quick as it started the contact ended and the woman ran off into the woods. <br>
<br>
She was going to turn and enter the house but instead closed the door and began to make her way up the small hill. Stopping near a stup she noticed by the footprints that the other woman had been standing there for some time. A glint of light on the stump caught her eye. Reaching down she picked up a small jade sparrow. It still felt warm from the hand that held it last. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tshaya! Ye comin?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye I be der in a moment Vorsa!&quot; she called back. <br>
<br>
With a final look to the woods she tucked the small charm safely within her tunic. <br>
<br>
It would make a lovely necklace, she thought. <br>
<br>
************************* <br>
<br>
Siofra watched Tshaya walk back down the hill and enter the house. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ashlen Devlese, Romale&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>**may you remain with god**</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she whispered before making her way back to where Ilsamore still slept. <br>

<br>
She knew she should be happy she finally found her dya but instead she was filled with a greater sense of loss. Before, she could imagine anything she wanted when she finally came across her dya. She could imagine a big rescue and joyously returning to Hibernia with her dya in tow. The fact that it was impossible to return Tshaya hit Siofra hard. Tshaya didn't remember her previous life. She had a whole new one, complete with children. <br>
<br>
Siofra tried to push the thoughts aside as she paced the room like a caged lynx. Eventually sleep began to overcome her and she sat on the chair beside Ilsa's bed and rested her head on her arms.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vestachasiofra>VestachaSiofra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beloved lil Elf</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/6/03 4:23:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Into the Wolf's Den</span><hr size=1> Slowly and with great effort Ilsamore managed to open his eyes.

<br>
He tried lifting a hand to touch her, but did not manage to lift it more than a few inches. Ilsamore gave a resigned sigh and dropped his hand back to the bed covers. Siofra seemed to be asleep or deep in thought. <br>

&quot;While ye were asleep I found my dya,&quot; she said changing the subject.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vestachasiofra>VestachaSiofra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beloved lil Elf</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/6/03 4:34:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Into the Wolf's Den</span><hr size=1> Ilsamore turned to look at Siofra. <br>
<br>
&quot;You did? How was she and where?&quot; <br>
<br>
To Ilsamore this news was a double edged sword. He was happy that Siofra had found what she was looking for, but it also reminded him of his failure. <br>
<br>
Ilsamore sighed deeply. <br>
<br>
&quot;Then it's over?&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A0B0E0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vestachasiofra>VestachaSiofra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beloved lil Elf</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/6/03 4:37:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Into the Wolf's Den</span><hr size=1> Siofra nodded and bit her lip again. <br>
<br>
&quot;She won't be coming back with us though.....&quot; she said, her voice strained. <br>
<br>
Ilsamore reached out towards Siofra again. <br>
<br>
He did not know the fate of Tshaya but knew, from the look on Siofra's face that she was not dead, or in pain. But Siofra did not look like she wanted to talk about it, so he left it at that.<br>
<br>
A tear dropeed from Siofra's eye to splash on her hands. Quickly she wiped her eyes to remove any other tears which wanted to try and escape the dam she had built. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yer ok though? I wasn't too late? That woman didn't do anything to you did she?&quot; she asked, her face contorting to one of hatred as she mentioned the norse woman.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be alright love, no need to worry&quot; Ilsamore winced in pain again as he tried to get up to show her that he was well. Tired and defeated he dropped back to the mattress. <br>
<br>
&quot;I just need some rest I guess&quot; he mumbled in explanation. <br>
<br>
Siofra nodded. <br>
<br>
&quot;When yer up to it, we'll go back to Hibernia. The kumpa'nia's probably wondering where we are.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ilsamore moved over on the bed with some effort before motioning for Siofra to join him. Siofra climbed on the bed but remained on her own side when he tried to get her to lay closer. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yer still hurt Ilsa. I'm not going te risk hurtin ye more. I'll be right here. Now go te sleep,&quot; she chided. Secretly she was glad of the excuse to be able to keep her distance from Ilsa. She had a lot on her mind and some of the thoughts caused her to shiver in horror once again. <br>
<br>
Luckily she managed to keep her thoughts from surfacing until she saw Ilsamore breathing deeply and evenly. He needed his rest, that much she knew and she wasn't about to prevent that. Thoughts whirled around her head until she finally fell asleep as well. <br>
<br>
It would be another couple days until Ilsamore would be strong enough to travel back to Hibernia <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=82.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=82.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=82.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.threadControl?topicID=82.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=82.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=82.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm1">Announcements<option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8">Role Playing Stories - General<option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm10">Role Playing Stories - Mature<option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm14">The Crossroads Tavern<option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm13">Story Comments, Queries and Kudoes<option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm7">Role Play Primers & Guides<option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm9">Role Playing Questions and Comments<option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm11">Backstage<option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm12">Questions, Topic Suggestions, Show Guest Suggestions<option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm2">The Hot Seat<option value="kelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm4">Administration Discussion</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter>Kelryck's DAoC Role Play Community & Story Archives</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm8>Role Playing Stories - General</a> <font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
