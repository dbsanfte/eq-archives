Race: Vampyre<br>
Age:203<br>
Apparent age:19<br>
Height: 5'7<br>
Weight:130 lbs<br>
<br>
Appearance: Adelina has long golden hair, streaked with red. that reaches to the middle of her back in big curls. she has almond shaped golden colored eyes that glow red when she is angered. She wears A black bodysuit, that is low cut to a v shape where you can see the bottom of her black bra.she often wears a black cloak thats hooded when she goes inside or is trying not to be noticed. She has very light porcelain skin, that only changes slightly when she feeds. She has a pretty small frame, but is abnormally strong for someone of her size. <br>
<br>
Personality: Adelina is not the nicest vampyre you could come across, she is a vampyre and does nothing to change the thirst she has or her evil ways. she has never denied her thirst or her attitude to say things bluntly. She is a creature of the night and never hides her identity and doesnt care for anybody but herself. she is evil, and on top of that she is sarcastic. she loves the hunt and adrenaline that comes with hunting her prey whoever the unlucky being may be. She never has cared what anybody thought and she enjoys being evil. She doesnt trust or rely on anybody but herself.<br>
<br>
Weapons: She only carries one weapon, a small daggar that is sheathed in deerskin attatched to a silver chain slung low on her waist. it is curvy and sharp as her fangs. its handle is pure silver, and there is one red ruby in the middle of it.<br>
<br>
Abilities: she is talented at defending herself if needed, she is fairly good at martial arts and does extremely well with the one daggar she has.  She can walk in the sunlight thanks to a silver ring her father bestowed on her when she was to be wed. she did not know at the time it would come in handy. although she can walk in the sunlight she does not often choose to for the sunlight irritates her eyes greatly, and the stronger she gets as a vampyre the more the sun irritates her. SHe can not fly, but she can hover for about 5 hours if needed for some reason. She heals extremely quick, a gift that most vampyres also posses. she does not know if she can regenorate, for she has never had the oppertunity to test that ability. She can also be very seductive, to lead her prey to her.<br>
<br>
Weaknesses: she is not affected by holiwater or crosses though they make her a bit uncomferatable. she is how ever very wary of sharp objects directed around her heart, and she would like to keep her head if possible. She also is wary of elven weapons, that seer her skin and either cause her great pain or her death. She also has a weakness for clocks, she hates time. to her it is useless and she doesnt wish to see how many days, hours or years have passed by. if she is confronted with a clock of any kind she will either break it immediatly or turn it so it faces the other direction.<br>
<br>
History: Adelina was born on an faraway island, where her family lived with a small tribe of people. It provided its own plethra of food, mostly fruit and vegetables. and there was a freshwater stream and waterfall in the center of the island. She was 19 when she found out that her father had betrothed her to Ailbhe, a man she had grown up with and had learned to love. her father had gaven her his most precious gift, a silver ring that he said was enchanted to make all her dreams come true. she laughed absently, and didnt think anything of it.<br>
<br>
He had gotton it when he had whent on his early adventures, the precise town she did not know. SHe was surprised to find later that it really was enchanted, but not in the way her dear father thought. <br>
<br>
she was bathing in the water fall, the spray tickleing her body. she swam in the deep pool of water, thinking about the ceremony that was to be performed the next night. She was to marry Ailbhe, and they would go stay on the opposite side of the island to be by themselves for 4 days. She was excited but also very nervous. She got distracted and when she snapped back to reality when she heard a rustle in the brush on the left side of the water. She yelled &quot;hello is there anybody there?&quot; she was innocent as they come, and also naieve. <br>
<br>
she got closer to the bushes just as a young girl appeared out of the brush. She was a few years younger than Adelina, and had straight black hair and wide black eyes. she looked at adelina as if she could see right through her. Adelina got out of the water, her long hair sticking to her back, shoulders and chest. she walked over and kneeled next to the girl &quot; hello, i am adelina, are you lost? i have never seen you here before.&quot;<br>
<br>
The little girl looked at her, her black eyes piercing Adelinas soul. she smiled wickedly, and revealed glistening white canine teeth. abnormally large canine teeth. Adelina had heard of vampyres, but only as a myth. She gasped and stood up, and the little girl said in a chilling voice &quot; why yes milady, i am lost but not by accident&quot; and with that she lunged at Adelina.<br>
<br>
Adelina struggled but the girl was abnormally strong. she bit adelinas neck and she stopped struggling. it was a peaceful sensation, it didnt hurt but was rather soothing. she felt the blood draining from her body slowly. Adelina was very weak and faint, the little girl lifted her head up and pushed her wrist against her mouth. Adelina was confused but she swallowed the warm liquid that was gliding down her throat. as she drank the blood, she felt her blood flow slow and than stop as did her breath and heartbeat. it was as if her blood froze in her body, and she only breathed out of habit. she lost conciousness and she fell into a sleep that intailed only black and white. as if that was the only thing left. when she awoke the little girl was gone, and Adelina was angry and hungry. she needed blood, of all the things she would eat. She went back to camp and after everybody figured out she was a vampyre, she was banned from the island. they said her soul was no longer pure and kind, she said what soul. and than she slaughtered a single man and left to find a mainland. It was the fact that her family rejected her that made her evil, and now she wouldnt have it any other way.<br>

But weak against clocks isn't a weakness lol, its a state of mind. You will have to add another 2 weaknesses to replace the &quot;elven&quot; one and the &quot;clock&quot; one since I see you have quite a few abilities.<br>

Otherwise welcome to MR and enjoy.<br>

 2 more weaknesses: holiwater- it stings her skin, and creates a red rash on wherever it touched her. it could only kill her if it continued to eat away her flesh.<br>
<br>
  and if its okay id like to keep the elven weapons one because even if it is unlikely, anybody could have a weapon made by elven magic. the could have killed an elf, or bought one somehow you never know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#8B4513>(11/19/03 10:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: adelina andreios</span><hr size=1> Well this board is based on a &quot;reality&quot; we sorta currently live in.
