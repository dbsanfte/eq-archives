I read somewhere that you were suppose to have a password for this forum but when I clicked on the Journal thingie, it didn't ask for a password so now I'm not sure whether I can post here or not....so someone let me know if I'm suppose to get a password or something...<br>
<br>
So about school....it wasn't as bad today as I thought it was going to be.  I had my first AP History test yesterday and I was so scared I had totally bombed it.  Our teacher decided to let us correct another class's test today, but I'm pretty sure from the answers he gave us that I got a low B if not a C.  I know it's stupid but I was hoping if I didn't get a high B or an A, then I'd get a D or lower because then I'd be able to take the test over again.  I don't know why but grades have always meant A LOT to me.  But I feel soooo bad complaining about my grade when practically everybody else got an F.<br>
<br>
This whole week has been so overwhelming.  I had a big test in every one of my classes over a span of three days!  But tomorrow's Friday!!! Whoo-hoo!!! <br>
<br>
Okey-dokey...that's about all...oh yeah, the book I'm reading!  I'm just about done with &quot;The Story Girl&quot; by L.M. Montgomery, who's one of my favorite authors.  It was mainly about these kids from Prince Edwards Island in Canada and their childhood and one of the children has this amazing voice that can charm anybody.  Okay, that didn't quite do justice to the book but it was sooo good.  I love all the descriptions that Montgomery put in the book.  I totally recommend it to everybody!!!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/uredheadedgoddess.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Redheaded Goddess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><img src='http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/tr/tr_34.gif'>CLBL Admin</span><br>  Posts: 489<br> <font color=#3333ff>(9/25/02 6:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tiffany's Journal</span><hr size=1> Nah, it's all good Tiffany! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  No password for now!<br>

<br>
*sigh* I had a bad academic day today...actually, it's been mainly a bad academic week on a whole.  I didn't get as good of a grade on my tests as I thought I would and today in European History, we had to answer some essay questions in a group and I ended up doing most of the answering while the rest of my group talked about who's going out with who and blah, blah, blah.  I really didn't care that I had to answer it by myself, it just seemed like I didn't answer it as well as I could and I already have a B in the class and I don't want to risk getting a low grade that could pull it down to a C since we don't do that much work in the class...<br>
<br>
You know, whoever said that high school was the best years of your life probably never even WENT to high school.  I have hours of homework ahead of me on Saturday, which is pratically my only free day when I can relax.  Not only that, did I mention I have NO social life???  It just feels like I don't have any friends.  <br>
<br>
I have like three close friends at school and that's wonderful and all...but let's see, two of them are also close friends with each other, and let me just say this, 3 best friends NEVER work.  I mean, we always include each other when we do stuff, but sometimes I can't help getting a teensy bit jealous when one of them acts so happy to see the other one and goes off to walk with her to class or something.  And sometimes I feel like those two don't really know me at all, like the real me.  They're both so...mellow, I guess, and they never rush things, but I tend to be really excited and upbeat (or sometimes even angry!) at stuff and whenever I am, I just wonder if they think I'm weird and all for being like that.  Sometimes, I think we're just friends because we've known each other for awhile and we're in the same classes and by high school, people usually already have their 'clique' established.<br>
<br>
Then there's my other best friend who hardly knows my other two friends.  She's one of my oldest and dearest friends and she's the funnest person to be around.  I've started to notice over the past couple of years that she's becoming more popular and being friends with the 'in' crowd.  Now I have no problems with this and we've always stayed good friends and she doesn't act snobbish or anything.  <br>
<br>
Then last year, she got to be really good friends with another girl and they do stuff and talk together all the time.  I've never had any problems with her having other good friends.  This year, she's still good friends with the girl from last year, and she's even made some more really good friends too.  Now, whenever I walk with her down the hall, it seems like she knows everyone and I feel funny standing next to her as she talks to so-and-so.  She's never done or say anything to make me feel this way, but I sometimes feel like I'm tagging along after her as she makes her rounds and I'm not good enough or something.  Then today, when I asked her why she wasn't riding the bus home after school, she said she had to do something with a friend and it was a secret.  Lately, she's been having all these secret things she has to do with her friend and I know it's nothing bad, I know it's an inside joke with her and her friend.  It just really hurts because she's never kept any secrets from me before.  But what's really getting me down is that it just seems like she's getting more and more new good friends and I have the same several good friends I've had since middle school and the rest just acquaintances... *sigh*<br>
<br>
Okay, this has been waaaay too long so I think I'll stop now.  I'm not currently reading any books since I haven't really had any time, so until later (which will probably be next Friday)! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/uredheadedgoddess.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Redheaded Goddess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><img src='http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/tr/tr_34.gif'>CLBL Admin</span><br>  Posts: 494<br> <font color=#3333ff>(9/29/02 4:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tiffany's Journal</span><hr size=1> Tiffany,<br>

So not much to say, I'm soooo glad it's Friday.  This week has worn me out so much.  I had at least one test every single day...okay maybe not EVERY single day, but close.  One good thing though was that I drove on the street for the very first time.  Hurrah!!!  Of course, I also nearly ran into a pedestrian and probably gave my instructor a heart attack, but minor details, minor details.  So yeah, that was the highlight of my week...so far!  Still have two days to go for something more exciting to happen.  <br>
<br>
Okay, now about the book I'm reading.  It's the second one in this one series called Abby by Pamela Walls.  I just picked it up for some light reading and it's really too easy a book for me to be reading but I really like it a lot.  It's about this girl name Abby and her best friend Luke who goes on a hunt for a treasure to help out Abby's family who's in desperate need of money.  They encounter all sorts of danger on the way and Abby learns to trust God to always provide for them.  I'm not exactly done yet but it looks like it's going to be a happy ending!<br>
<br>
P.S.  I was just reading in my planner that the school gives to all the kids and they have some really quirky quotes in there.  I thought these were cute and sooo true:  &quot;Optimist: A person who starts taking a bath if he accidentally falls into a river&quot; and &quot;Etc.: a sign to make others believe that you know more than you actually do&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/bchristlikebooklovers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moonlite127>Moonlite127</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezHopeful</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#3333ff>(11/18/02 8:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tiffany's Journal</span><hr size=1> Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

This whole week has been...I don't know, wow!  On Saturday, I had my first debate tournament and everything that could have possibly gone wrong did!  First, we were late getting there.  Then, when we did get there, everybody was dressed up and everything with these huge stacks of boxes for their papers and all we had was my friend's beach bag where we had stuffed in all our papers.  Then, five minutes before it started, we discovered that we couldn't use the case we had spent hours preparing because we were suppose to read or quote directly from this 100 page package they gave us so we had paraphrased everything.  We decided there was nothing we could do about that so we went ahead to our room, except we went to the wrong one and when we finally found the right one, we were about ten minutes late.  so we walk into the right room, and we realize that we were debating against my former best friend! So anyways, we lost that first round, but we did end up winning our other two.  It was soooo tiring.  I was about to drop dead when the three rounds were over with.  So we went to the awards ceremony and they were giving out trophies for the top ten teams and we had came in tenth place!!!!!!  I have always wanted a trophy or something because all my friends seem to be so good at soccer or piano or something and I never really had a talent and here, I got a trophy for DEBATE!  I'm a pretty shy person and I joined debate so that I can become more comfortable talking in front of people, but I didn't expect to win ANYTHING...so yeah, my friend and I were really excited and people kept congratulating us and it was soooo fun!  But we only won because the other teams hurt themselves by going off topic during the debate, but still!  Lol, I'm sooo excited!  Okay, well, I gotta go, homework calls! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

There's just been so much going on and if you can believe it, I joined another club, Junior Statesmen of America (JSA).  I'm actually going to be going to a JSA Congress thing in March and I'm so excited since it's going to be in a different state, but nervous too.  We had to write a bill or amendment to go and if our bill gets passed by the Senate or the House of Representatives (or something, I forget), then we'd have to speak in front of like, 200 hundred people. (Yikes!)  <br>
<br>
At first there were only juniors and seniors in there and the faculty advisor who also happens to be our history teacher got desperate for some younger members and he started advertising in his classes about how good JSA looks on college transcripts and everything so a lot of people began to join.  But what really annoys me is that they just sign up and then never comes to the meetings and some people just joined because they wanted to get in the yearbook!!!  I mean, the least thing they could do is at least come to the meetings.  There's a meeting like once every two weeks so it shouldn't throw off their schedule that much.<br>
<br>
Anyways, time to sign off!  Oh yeah, the book I'm reading right now is Sunsets by Robin Gunn, which I'm sure most of us have read already.  This is my second time through the series and I'm taking my time reading it to try and get the full impact of the story.  Right now, I'm halfway through.  I've gotten to the fourth of July Bongo-fest (that is so hilarious!) and I'm up to the point where Brad and Alissa are having lunch with Chet and Rosie.  Actually, that's what I think I might do right now, go and finish the book...so later!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showPrevMessage?topicID=19.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showNextMessage?topicID=19.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.emailToFriend?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.threadControl?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="christlikebookloversfrm16">Bookends<option value="christlikebookloversfrm31">Amusement Park<option value="christlikebookloversfrm25">Christian Fiction<option value="christlikebookloversfrm22">General Fiction<option value="christlikebookloversfrm33">Science Fiction<option value="christlikebookloversfrm26">Christian Non-Fiction<option value="christlikebookloversfrm21">General Non-Fiction<option value="christlikebookloversfrm24">Teen's<option value="christlikebookloversfrm23">Children's<option value="christlikebookloversfrm30">Poetry<option value="christlikebookloversfrm29">Poets Unite!<option value="christlikebookloversfrm27">Journals<option value="christlikebookloversfrm20">Administration</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bchristlikebooklovers>Christ Like Book Lovers</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27>Journals</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
