It had taken her the better part of the day and into the night to get back here after coming out of the subway. Not that there was much distinction between night and day anymore. Daylight consisted of a hazy grey that filtered through the pollution. And even though it didn't deter the Vamps any longer from coming out, it was still mostly their chosen time of rest, and far safer to travel in. And she'd been lucky, only crossing the path of a couple of Vamps that she'd quickly hidden from, until they passed.<br>
<br>
It had started to rain, and water began to drip down Taylee's long hair as she hugged her knees close against her chest. She stayed on the outskirts of the park, not knowing what lurked farther in. Even the vamps wouldn't go into the park. Sighing she wondered not for the first time what had become of Cynthia and the wolf, and hoped the men that had chased her hadn't caught them. They'd probably stayed in the subway tunnels, she thought remembering Cynthia telling her she had she had a place somewhere down there.<br>
<br>
Taylee reached in one of her pockets, searching around for her knife. As her fingers wrapped around it, they brushed a piece of paper. Grabbing it and leaving the knife, she pulled it out. Frowning, she unfolded the scrap, and saw the black lettering boldly scrawled across it. Tracing it with a finger, she read the address. Then shaking her head, she folded it back up and stuffed it in her pocket. 'No way,' she told herself, 'I cant go there...even if I could get there, he wouldn't really want me at his place.'<br>
<br>
Taylee reached back in and this time pulled out the knife. Opening it with a shaking hand, she traced a line across the back of her hand and watched as the blood welled up from the shallow cut, &quot;Tainted blood,&quot; she whispered, &quot;they don't want you around them.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/3/03 2:29 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> The smell of fresh blood filled my lungs as I strode quietly through the mist and rain. It came from a park bench occupied by a girl who was huddled with her knees under her chin. I was close enough to see the rain running down the long strands of her hair but it was her ghouled blood that called me. The blood of ghouls was my poison and she was drawing me to her quite successfully.<br>
<br>
Quietly I moved up behind her, a sly look upon my lips as I licked them with my tongue. This ghoul was foolish to cut herself in this area that lurked with vampires or was she? Perhaps she was drawing them to herself as a trap? I had heard that vampires were taking over this dark city and that certain factions were rising up and fighting. Now if I was a rebel against the vampires I would use a ghoul to lure them out as well. But I was also a vampire hater, their killer and in some twisted sense I saw myself as the protector of mortals. I had to laugh inwardly though since back in the day and when hunting vampires, I had killed many humans. <br>
<br>
&quot;You know... this is not exactly the best place to be sitting...&quot; I spoke to make my presense known as I moved around the park bench and sat down beside her. &quot;All sorts of creaturs out here tonight are just dying for some blood....&quot; I eyed her hand with a hidden hunger before looking into her face. She was a pretty one I had to admit. But if she was a trap or just a foolish victim, I was not about to let my hunger show. &quot;Mind if I join you... miss?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/3/03 3:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> Not a word did the hunter utter. He was frozen in his place by the sight of the ghoul. George had convinced himself that he had only come to the park because it was on his route, but another part knew it was because he was hoping to see her. And now that he did he didn't know what to do. He stayed beside the tree, resting the leg brace he had put on against the tree.<br>
<br>
When the red haired girl revealed herself, George did not move an inch. He knew something was wrong, but just watched. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

Looking up as the woman came into view and sat down beside her, Taylee slowly slid the hand holding the knife into her pocket, and dropping it, fingered the gun. These days anyone could be a threat, and it paid to be ready. Especially now that she was being hunted down by Cale.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You know... this is not exactly the best place to be sitting....All sorts of creatures out here tonight are just dying for some blood....Mind if I join you... miss?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Taylee shrugged at the last question, since the girl was already seated. &quot;And most of those creatures don't set foot in the park. I hear there's things that even the bloodsuckers are afraid of here,&quot; she said, eyeing the redheaded girl next to her. Narrowing her eyes, Taylee continued, &quot;So why are you here? Something you wanted?&quot; <br>
<br>
She tightened her hand around the gun, noticing the girl's eyes straying to the blood on her other hand. If this girl was a vamp, which Taylee didn't think was the case, the bullet wouldn't kill her but it sure would hurt like hell and slow the redhead down enough for her to get away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/3/03 10:38 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> &quot;You flatter me with praise already and we just met.&quot; I smiled at her comment about there being things out tonight that even vampires feared. Despite my grin through I remained serious for I could tell this girl was armed, but with what I did not know yet.<br>
<br>
&quot;By the time you draw forth that weapon you conceal and try and harm me with it... I can kill you in so many ways.&quot; I continued as I slowly leaned foward to look more closely into her eyes. If she had not noticed before, she would notice by now the swords on my forarms, the blades pointing away from my hands. Perhaps even the daggers and guns on my belt would make her think otherwise but I was not about to be to obvious. &quot;You see I could have killed you already had I wished but where is the fun in that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly and almost impossible to track with human eyes, I darked away to perch upon a nearby trash can, my eyes locked on hers as I grinned to show my fangs. Again I moved only to reappear before her crouched on the ground as both blades on my arms clicked foward in a very deadly fashion so that they became like extentions of my arms. &quot;You see hitting me may be difficult... and a waste of bullets for I have not the desire to kill you...&quot; my voice was sultry as I crawled slowly on all fours towards her, my hips swaying seductivly. <br>
<br>
As I did so I could sense we were being watched by someone in the shadows even though I could not see who. Who ever it was did not seem like much of a threat but I was not about to take any chances. My blades clicked back into place as I slowly stood up and returned to my seat beside her though I sat sideways facing her so I could watch the shadows behind us out of the corner of my eye. It was becoming obvious now that this would not be a private feeding which was pissing me off greatly. Of all the nights that I wanted to do something less attention grabbing, someone had to watch anyway.<br>
<br>
&quot;I might as well inform you of why I am here... I need to feed.&quot; My blunt honesty came from my confidance. &quot;Do not mistake me for a vampire just yet though my dear for I am not. I hate vampires... all of them but like them I must feed. Your young tainted blood has a very sweet calling to my tastes... and foolish are you to have cut yourself open in a place such as this... I am the least of your worries when it comes to attracting attention for I might at least ask.&quot; I licked my fangs mildly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/3/03 11:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> The moment the blades came out, George had his gun in his hand. He limped forward. The brace allowed him to move better but not full speed. His gun was cocked and set to hair trigger mode. He may not be able to track her movements. But he has hit harder targets. &quot;If you want the girl, you're going to have to get through me,&quot; George shouted out. &quot;Just so you know, I don't have to hit you to kill you.&quot;<br>
<br>
George stepped forward, keeping the gun aimed at the dhampirs chest. &quot;Taylee. Didn't I tell you not to get yourself killed?

There was no way she could outrun, or even hope to attack someone with the abilities the redhead showed, not to mention, the weapons she carried.<br>
<br>
As the girl resumed her seat beside Taylee, she confirmed what Taylee had suspected, when she spoke, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I might as well inform you of why I am here... I need to feed. Do not mistake me for a vampire just yet though my dear for I am not. I hate vampires... all of them but like them I must feed....&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Taylee's heart began to pound at the thought of another feeding from her again, but she forcefully pushed the thought away. She didn't want that life, not anymore. About to bluff her way out of this situation, Taylee opened her mouth, to ask this girl if she knew who Taylee belonged too, well once, when she heard him, from somewhere close behind her.<br>
<br>
George. His image came flooding to her mind before she could turn. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;If you want the girl, you're going to have to get through me.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 'What the hell is he doing here?' Taylee thought, as she turned towards him. She watched as he stepped out into the open, continuing, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Taylee. Didn't I tell you not to get yourself killed? I know your choice here sucks, no pun intended, but the way I see it, either you trust me, or you let her take some of your blood.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Taylee stood up slowly, so as not to be taken as a threat by the girl beside her, and held up a hand. She was sure if this situation escalated any more one, or both of them might die. &quot;G-George, don't. Please?&quot; Didn't he know that this girl would kill her before he could even get a shot off. &quot;I-I do...trust you,&quot; she said realizing that she did, at least right now, trust him. &quot;Can you trust me?&quot; Taylee asked, looking across the short distance, into his eyes.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/5/03 10:57 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> My red lips curled in a smirk as the situation turned into something more to my liking. Blood was about to be spilled and I was looking forward to it. &quot;You should never open your mouth with threats you can not back up.&quot; My voice was a sneer as I watched the girl stand up. Obviously these two knew eachother so well enough that one might do something to save the other which was always a touching human trait I exploited.<br>
<br>
With ease I blurred from mortal vision, my movements perhaps easier to track from ghoul's eyes. I summersaulted over the gunman's head, my swords clicking into place with a snap before I landed behind him. Quickly my sword struck him from behind, grazing the back of his neck just deep enough to pierce the skin before I leaped quickly away once more to reappear behind the girl.<br>
<br>
My blades clicked dangerously as I wrapped my arms around her, one around her waist, the other around her neck. The blade in my arm around her waist pointed right up into her chin though not enough to cut her as I licked the side of her neck. &quot;Move your hands from what ever weapons you carry...&quot; I whispered into her ear softly. &quot;And tell him to throw his away and no one will get hurt... much.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/5/03 1:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> George showed no surprise, did not even move when the girl moved faster than the human eye. He had fought vampires that could do that before. The blade that came across the back of his neck did not cause him to flinch. Just another scar. The only thing that had caused him to show any reaction was the dark figure that stepped fromt the shadows behind the girl.<br>
<br>
&quot;You think that a ghoul is going to make the George the great toss away his weapon?&quot; the black man asked, aiming the revolver at the back of the dhampirs head.<br>

&quot;Eric. Been a while, my teacher.&quot;<br>

&quot;Taylee wouldn't stand for Taylea would it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe, how would I know? What's it matter?&quot; George didn't like where this was going.<br>

The blonde girl found it hard to track the girls movements but saw the gleam of her blade as it struck George.<br>
<br>
Taylee gasped as seconds later a pair of arms wrapped around her, pulling her back against the other girl roughly. 'Damn I'm beginning to hate this girl,' Taylee thought as she felt the point of a blade brush the underside of her chin, and she felt the girl's tongue slide along her neck.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Move your hands from what ever weapons you carry.....And tell him to throw his away and no one will get hurt... much.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->Taylee heard the whispered order, and slowly pulled her hand out of her pocket leaving the gun behind. She had just opened her mouth to follow the next command when she noticed that George wasn't looking at them but something over their shoulders. <br>
<br>
Taylee's heart began to pound faster as she heard another voice, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;You think that a ghoul is going to make George the great toss away his weapon?.....&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> A frown of confusion creased her brow, as Taylee stood in the redhead's tight embrace, while she tried to follow the conversation between the two men. <br>
<br>
She heard George making introductions like this was some damn party instead of her being held by a psycho bitch with a blade to her throat. But a sinking feeling took over at the man's words, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Taylee wouldn't stand for Taylea would it?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> His next words echoed from far away as thoughts ran rampant through her head. Only a few people knew that name...and if he knew it ..he'd been sent after her.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the tight grip the other girl had, had on her loosened, the blade nicking her throat as the girl collapsed behind her. But as she began to run towards George she heard <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I'm gonna have to take you both back alive.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She was still moving in George's direction, as she turned her head to see the man coming after her. &quot;NO!&quot; she screamed. <br>

My grip on the girl now known to me as Taylee remained tight as the vampire Eric talked to the mortal George. Some how I knew this was not going to turn out to my advantage since it seemed like everyone here had a friend to help them out conveniently were as I was brave enough to face things on my own.<br>
<br>
I always hated people needing help with their battles but there was nothing I could do now. Instead I could only flinch as I felt the force of the punch coming to the back of my head. It was a foolish move on his part for the blow to the back of my head caused me to pitch forward and jam the tip of my blade into the girl's throat. I had not intended on hurting her but as the world around me spun, I knew it would only be a matter of moments before she would realise she was bleeding.<br>
<br>
My knees buckled as I fell to the side but it was a blow I could recover from. I had felt worse in my day but that did not mean this one did not hurt. I winced and fought back the dizzy cry as I stood up to my feet in the pouring rain. Dimly I could see Taylee running towards George as I wiped my red hair from my eyes. My ears picked up the vampire's statement of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;needing us both alive&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but that might be tougher then he expected. <br>

Don't worry this will only hurt for a second.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe two,&quot; George responded his own gun aimed at Eric's head. A scene flashed through his mind.<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
A black man sits on the ground as a boy comes into the frame. &quot;You here about the vamps?&quot; the man asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah. Just another thing to worry about,&quot; the younger George answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just so you know if anything happens to me and I become one of these undead S.O.B.'s...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't hesitate for a second, teach.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
George held an expression on his face that was completely cold. Under his breath he wispered, &quot;Bye, teach.&quot; The hammer pulled back and realeased without a hitch. Eric turned to fire but by the time his gun was in position, the bullet was already in his skull and exploded, forcing the gun from his hand landing right at George's foot.<br>
<br>
Reaching down, George picked up the weapon. &quot;Not for a second,&quot; he said as he holstered it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

She came to a stop several paces behind George and crouched down. 'This is never going to stop,' she thought, looking up to see if the Vamp was following. Somehow she trusted the fact that George wouldn't let him get her, although she didn't quite know why. Maybe because he'd reminded her earlier, that he wanted the pleasure of killing her, himself.<br>
<br>
As the rain beat down on her crouching form, Taylee felt a tickle on her neck and reaching up to brush whatever had caused it away, felt something warm and sticky. Pulling her hand away, she looked down at fingers covered with blood. At that moment, a shot rang out, causing her to jump and look up in time to see the Vamp crumpling to the ground beside the redheaded girl.<br>
<br>
Taylee's eyes quickly went to George, seeing him bend down to retreive a gun at his feet. She heard him say, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Not for a second,&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but didn't understand. <br>
<br>
Keeping an eye on the other girl, Taylee straightened up, and keeping a hand on her wound, made her way over to where George stood, &quot;What are we going to do now?&quot; she asked, &quot;And what about her?&quot; Taylee stood, shivering, as she waited for an answer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/7/03 7:51 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> I watched from the sidelines as George shot and killed his vampire teacher. The teacher did not seem very much along the lines of a powerful vampire worthy to teach if he could be blown away by a single bullet. Personally in my own experience if I was that slow I would have died before I had fully realised who I was.<br>
<br>
I did feel a small amount of remorse for hurting Taylee but the feeling of regret passed quickly as I stood there very cautiously in the rain. I had only ment to feed from her, not injure her with my sword but that was not my fault. My actions had only ment to command, not actually hurt. In most cases my blood stained swords were enough to frighten without me using them.<br>
<br>
My ears listened as Taylee asked the mortal what she was to do and what to do about me and I smirked mildly. If I felt like doing anything, they had no power to stop me. It was amusing to watch them think they had control of the situation but I wanted blood and hers no matter what George said. He could not remain with her forever and I had my own forms of distractions to use.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes... what to do about me indeed...&quot; I hissed through fangs as I stared coldly at them both as water ran down my face, dripped off my chin and splashed onto the tops of my revealed breasts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#8B4513>(8/7/03 9:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Without Hope</span><hr size=1> The dhampir radiated confidence.

That, plus the katana on his back would be sufficient to deal with even an aged vampire at full strength, let alone a dhampir. For some reason, however, George did not want to kill her today.<br>
<br>
Even though he was not going to kill her, he didn't plan on letting her take any of Taylee's blood. &quot;What happens to her is none of our concern, provided she does not try anything,&quot; George told Taylee, letting the dhampir hear him.

Just because he was trying to protect her from the redhead, didn't mean he wanted anything further to do with her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well then, I guess this leaves us at a stand off.&quot; Taylee said. Bringing her hand into view, she looked down at her bloody fingers. It appeared the flow of blood from the cut had slowed. Wiping her hand on a pant leg, Taylee looked back up. &quot;Personally, I don't give a damn if the two of you kill each other....but I'm getting out of here.&quot; With a false bravado, she turned. She had no idea where she was going to go, but she was sick of freezing her butt off, while these two tried to out macho each other. <br>
<br>
&quot;See ya around, George,&quot; Taylee said not looking at the man.

The bitch in me was becoming more and more furious as I became even more hungry. The scent of Taylee's blood still filled the air for my sensitive nostrals. But I could not figure out what was holding me back. Normally I would just kill what ever mortal stood in my way but I was letting George live. If only he knew just how fortunate he really was this moment. He was keeping me from my food and I watched as Taylee walked boldly away from us. Oh she had not seen the last of me that was for sure.<br>

Needless to say I was pretty pissed off at the moment. First a mortal interups my feeding and second declares he is better then me? Someone had better read up on the rules again and accept its to late to change the fact he is nothing compared to me. I watched them go and I noticed they passed by three mortals, all apparent gang members by their colours. All three were armed with guns as well. It was time for me to vent my frustrations again those that mode the system and I knew George and Taylee would witness my rage.<br>
<br>
Breaking into a run and clicking my blades into place, I rushed up to the mortals with the same normal abilities as George. A high pitched scream of anger escaped my lips, alerting the men who began to fire in my direction as George would have no choice to if I was attacking him. With ease I dodged their attacks, the bullets singing past me as I made my way closer. But the bullets stopped as I ripped into them with my blades, their blood spraying forth and raining down like mist around us. I enjoyed their cries of pain which soon parished as they fell to the blood soaked ground in pieces. Arms, legs, heads... everything else all a mess and in a matter of seconds. <br>
<br>
Bending down I picked up one of the heads and lifted it over my lips so the blood flowed from it and into my mouth. I fed hungerly, angerly and ripped into the flesh with my fangs. George was next if he was not careful and now I was full and ready to go stalk Taylee for I did not accept orders from just any piece of shit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty
