Several Lus mechs surrounded his men. The battle begun. Gao was outnumbered 20-1 And he had less adavanced mechs as well. All he could count on was his stratigies. He told his men to move to the sides and dive into the enemy. He would then Fly up while they where distracted and blast them. Then his men would retreat and then do it a few more time. The Lus soldier began to catch on so Gao changed his plan. After they dived this time he would fly behind th enemy and take them from behind. But he had to move fast. If he didnt his men would be killed. He got behind and took out several of the mechs and his soldier took out the rest. Gao had won and now he searched the wrechage in search of parts.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zerhan@collisionworld>Zerhan</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.stationmp3.com/pancakechef/songs/xenogears.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/18/03 11:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm84.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Into the Jungle...</span><hr size=1> Valk was inside the cockpit of his stolen mech, but he had erased the Lus emblem on it.

Valk looked up at the suit.  &quot;Its you isn't it.&quot; he spoke into this communicator to Seric.  <br>
Seric: &quot;Oh, I remember that voice alright.  I'd never forget it.  So, have you met my brother yet?&quot;<br>
Valk:  &quot;Only for a short while.  I didn't talk to him though.&quot;<br>
Seric: &quot;Hmph.  The longer you take the easier it is for me.&quot;<br>
Valk: &quot;That's not going to happen, you know that right?&quot;<br>
Seric:  &quot;Depends.  I'm working with Lus now.  That'll keep your days numbered.  As well as the rest of these Rebel fools.  With the blade...<br>
Valk: &quot;So, he was right.  You DO have the blade.&quot;<br>
Seric: &quot;Of course.  I helped secure it.  Heh heh...&quot;<br>
Valk:  &quot;Its fitting of you.&quot;<br>
Seric:  &quot;Isn't it though?  Enough of this.  Call of your men.  I demand a Duel! 1 on 1!   You know what I mean.&quot;<br>
Valk: &quot;Fine.  Men, stop the attack on him.  Its my fight...&quot; <p>------<br>

They started off cross, and suddenly back thrusted.  Seric fired 3 rounds from his shoulder missles, and flew up, and forward nosedived toward Valk.  Valk narrowly avoided two missles, the second rammed into his left leg.  &quot;Left leg, medium damage.&quot; the computer responded.  &quot;So, you've got a custom Lus mech eh?&quot;  &quot;Thats none of your business.&quot; Valk snapped back.  Valk charged at Seric, faking a punch and then cutting into Seric's MS shoulder.  &quot;Thats it?  Look where you are now...&quot; Seric said, sounding very evil.  Valk looked over to Seric's MS,  the beam sword was contracted, and the capsule was against Valk's right side.  &quot;Damn.  You know that won't beat me though.&quot;  Valk said, trying to keep cool.  &quot;Oh, I know.&quot; Seric said, turning the sword on.  It cut right through the mech, just barely missing the generator.  &quot;Critical damage to right torso region.&quot; the computer responded again.  Valk had enough.  he fired two bursts from the chain machineguns stored on the mechs wrist.  They pounded into Serics mech.  he seemed stunned for a second, and Valk charged, punching the MS, it flew backward.  &quot;Gah..&quot; Seric said.  &quot;Well, after all these years, you certainly aren't rusty at all..&quot; Seric complemented.  &quot;Fine.  I'll spare you for now.  I won't mention this to Shu neither.  Just for good ol' times.  See ya!&quot; Seric cointinued, making his MS salute, and suddenly disappeared into two lines... <p>------<br>
