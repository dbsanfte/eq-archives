I really learned to fish in those parts back in the sixties.  It still feels like home when I can figure out where I am!  That area has exploded in growth over the years but most of the creeks are still where I left them.  <br>
<br>
First, of course, is what you want to fish for.  If it's trout then head east to the Beaver Tailwater section of the famous White River.  Very under-appreciated little stretch of tailwater which would be awesome with some decent minimum flow.  Also nearby is the manicured banks of Roaring River, a Missouri Trout Park near Cassville which is just a bit north of Beaver Dam.  I never felt right fishing Roaring River, only did it a couple of times, too many people and kind of fake.  I understand that if you grew up fishing in Pennslyvania that you don't mind fishing shoulder to shoulder with a license pinned to your hat!  <br>
<br>
If you are adventurous and looking for small creek smallmouth water, head south to the Illinois (east of Siloam Springs) or two of it's tributaries, Clear Creek (south of Tontitown on Hwy 112) and Osage Creek (east of Cave Springs).  <br>
<br>
Oh, and Spavinaw Creek (south of Gravette) is good for smallmouth and a portion of that creek has been stocked with Brown Trout, too, but I'd have a hard time directing you there; and technically, if you waded up from the Bridge, I don't think you would be trespassing either!  By the way, how big a boy are ya?<br>
<br>
Several of these creeks used to have Trout Farms on their feeder springs with the inevitable escapees.  I once caught a three pound Rainbow on Clear Creek.  Seriously, I love Clear Creek from Johnson to Wheeler and fished it daily for years.  That was where I first used a flyrod, a Garcia &quot;Conolon&quot; in light blue (no kidding!) that was truly horrific compared to today's cheapest rods!  Of course, I was using a &quot;level&quot; line because that's what the book I had said you used.  Ugh...  <br>
<br>
Really, from Bentonville, just about any direction you go will be pretty nice.  North to the Elk in Missouri, the creeks I mentioned to the south, and it just keeps getting better the farther east you go.  Dano can help with some ideas as you go farther east toward Harrison.  Anyway, narrow it down to species and maybe we can give you a little better idea of what to expect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Drifter</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#000000>(7/29/03 12:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fishing near Bentonville</span><hr size=1> Feltman - How far do you want to go and what do you want to fish for?<br>
Forget about Spavinaw. You will be trespassing wherever you go. They have put up so many barb wire fences. You have to cross 2 upstream and 3 downstream before you go 50 yds. off of the bridge. They haven't stocked trout in there for many years. The last was some rainbow in the upper area about 5-6 years ago, but they couldn't find any the next year when they sampled. The browns haven't been stocked for many, many years. Doubt if there are any left. Beaver is the place to go for trout. The fish can be on the small size and you have to treat it like a spring creek.the only problem is it is unwadable if they are releasing water.<br>
Warm water fishing is much better with alot more places to go. Holland gave a bunch of good places. Would add the King's and Osage east of Eureka Springs for good smallmouth. Yes, there are about 4 Osage creeks in the area. Little Sugar in Bella Vista can be good for smallies and panfish. It also has some good carp (5#-15# Arkansas bonefish)that will check out your backing.<br>
Give me a call if you want to fish. Or look at maps, etc. <br>

Here is a link for Taney <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.ozarkanglers.com/">www.ozarkanglers.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Also consider smallie fishing as Drifter said on the Kings River, and further east on the Buffalo National River and the premier smallie stream in Arkansas, Crooked Creek.

Ken, I thought that the AGFC was toying with the idea of stocking some of the Arkansas spring creeks much as Missouri has done.  Neat idea if they could pull it off.  Like I said, I've caught trout on Clear Creek that were doing quite well and that Creek is not a very good example of a small cold spring creek you know? <br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, I was visiting with a couple of biologists from Oklahoma State University a couple of years ago who were doing much the same thing on a feeder creek of Spavinaw on the Oklahoma side of the line for the ODOW.  They provided the program on the early results of their study at one of our Stillwater Flyfishers meetings.  Really got into the nuts and bolts of the study and methods used to sample the population.  They were surprised at the success they were having, mainly because they were not finding minnows on their stream.  They couldn't understand why the trout looked so healthy.  Bugs and crustacians!  Crawfish are around, but I know for a fact that these small streams are often just full of what we called freshwater shrimp.  Cressbugs, scuds, etc.  Also, they were not aware of the work the AGFC had done on Spavinaw and I suggested they compare notes, just for grins, as of course they had their own study parameters to deal with.  They said they would, but who knows.  Anyway, interesting stuff.<br>
<br>
BTW, are the small creeks being fished much anymore?  When Beaver went in the sixties, it seemed most folks stopped fishing the area creeks and when I'd ask about a creek in one of the minnow shops they'd say, &quot;Hell, that creeks been fished out for twenty years!&quot;  I'd shake my head at the loss of that fine creek and mumble something about what a shame that was and then giggle all the way back out to the truck!  You would not believe the numbers of two and three pound smallmouth I could catch on those fished out creeks.  Course you had to hike away from the bridge a little ways... at least fifty yards!<br>

The population growth has pushed the solitary fishers out. They are saying the population will be 400,000 within 20 years. The problem now is some of the Hispanics in the area don't understand conservation. The will catch and keep everything they can, of course they do not waste anything. This has caused the locals to say &quot;I'm going to get mine before it's gone&quot; and some of the fish populations are crashing.<br>
Spavinaw didn't work because of the preditors, big creek chubs, eagles, etc. and they put in very,very small fish. Some of the access points the AGFC was counting on fell through and they kind of gave up on it until they can get access worked out. Why stock for only the land owners?<br>
Holland you are right. get away from the bridges and amazingly there are lots of fish.

I favor Beaver Tailwaters the most for cold water, but until Arkansas GFC changes some regulations the fishing will never be spectacular.
