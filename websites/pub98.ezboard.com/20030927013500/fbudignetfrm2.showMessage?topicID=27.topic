Each day that I look into Jaci's clear eyes and listen to her thoughts I feel as if I'm being given a great gift.  Only Jaci could be so ill and look so vibrant and beautiful each day.  Her color is rosy and her mind is sharp, although her voice is subdued.  We talk together about what meaning life has had and continues to have for us.  Like all of us, Jaci sometimes wonders what she's accomplished and given to others thus far in her life.  I'd like to invite anyone who would like to share, either on this message board, or in a personal email or letter, what gifts they feel Jaci has given them or how she might have affected their lives in any way.  She doesn't know I'm requesting this, but I think such messages would be a great gift to her and a source of strength and love.  Of course everyone has been offering their love and support to her for months, and I don't mean to indicate anything different.  I just think this would be a timely boost for her now.<br>

<br>
When I went to visit Jaci a week or so ago, I shared with her one of the gifts she's given me.  <br>
<br>
Music.  I sang to her and for one song, we sang it together.<br>
<br>
When I sing with a group of friends, I often hear her voice singing the descant (particularly when singing those old Bob Dylan and Carole King tunes).  In my life, music is one of the most important parts.  <br>
<br>
I have strong memories of Jaci playing &quot;Daniel&quot; on the piano, strumming her guitar in church combo, and singing.  I was always, and still am inspired by this.  <br>
<br>

When 14th Street and Truman were absolutely &quot;booming&quot; with little kids (unfortunately for Kevin, mostly little &quot;girls&quot;)!  How often I would answer a knock on the door and it would be Jaci asking if Judy and Jody could come out to play! The &quot;kick the can&quot; games that went on after dark, and the &quot;treats&quot; that were handed out at every single house I do believe during an afternoon of playing.  Jaci, you were always so beautiful, neat in your appearance (I think you actually were one who &quot;cared&quot; how you looked even in your playclothes), and so very sweet to everyone who you were in contact with!  I never heard you scream and yell during play (like I did other kids - mine included), but you stood by and waited for any disagreements to solve themselves and then everyone was fine again.  You were a gem then, and still are Jaci! Even as I write this I visualize you at 6 or 7 and see you so clearly!  Our love to you dear one!

Treasured memories are those of a beautiful voice singing at birthdays and weddings and at the funeral of a dear great Aunt. <br>
Treasured memories are those of a woman and mother who has convictions and a sense of what needs to be done no matter how difficult, painful or unpleasant.  Jaci I admire you so much for this and it has given me greater resolve in tough situations. <br>
I know I am just touching the surface of the treasures that you have blessed us with Jaci. And,as time goes on I will reach into that treasure box of gifts from you and will feel blessed again and again.<br>

One of my favorite memories is from this past summer when Dan,Jaci,Joel and I were all sitting around the kitchen table listening to Jaci talk about the mission trip she was just getting home from in the wee hours of the morning.  We were all so tired but our hearts were glad that Jaci and Heidi were home safe and sound and it was fun to hear about their trip.<br>
I consider all of my sisters-in-law to be the sisters I never had and always wanted and Jaci is no exception to that.  I love you because you have such a good heart but at the same time are so wise and knowledgeable about so many things and I always learn and grow when I have had a chance to sit and talk with you.    God bless. Maria,Joel,Ashley,Chris and David too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Kim79</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(3/26/03 8:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbudignetfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Jaci Hartle</span><hr size=1> The past Five years of having been blessed with working with Jaci are all fond memories.  I can not pick just one they are all fond and joyful.  However the time Jaci got the call from the principal about her daughters inappropriate clothing attire was very humorous.  Jaci received a call that Heidi was wearing inappropriate clothing since it had Jesus Loves me on the top.  Boy I think that was the hottest I ever saw her as she marched on down to enlighten the principal about wearing a shirt that simply shows ones faith is anything but inappropriate. Also the fact that the reason Heidi liked the shirt was it also stated Jesus loves me and so does my dad.   Jaci has and continues to be one of the Best examples of what a True Mother is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Budig</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(4/4/03 6:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbudignetfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   memories</span><hr size=1> Jaci you have given me so many wonderful memories.  Of course OHS is where we met.  I remember trying out for Indianettes (the danceline).  You were always so graceful doing those high kicks and had a beaming smile.  We had some really fun times learning those routines and then performing them.  <br>
How about when we went to prom together, then after the dance we all went to our house for breakfast.  Those were the days.  You always helped me out with my boyfriend problems.  <br>
Then of course you were in our wedding wearing a lovely pink dress.  Oh yes and you, Dianne, and Kathy stole Craig and took him somewhere (?).  Thanks for the memories Jaci.  You have been a special friend to me and I am grateful.<br>
    I am now off to Florida for Spring Break with the boys for a week.  We will be staying with my parents.<br>

During those hectic and sometimes intense times, you were the voice of reason, of warm acceptance, one which extolled the joy of life at every turn.  You were a guide for me, helping me to make sense of or at least live thru and even get a laugh out of the trials and tribulations of teenage years.  I remember most your laugh, which was full of such warmth and genuine delight.  It always seemed to have the characteristic of having just caught you off-guard and overwhelming you with the humor in a situation.  You possessed kindness beyond your years, and you shared it with those around you on a regular basis.  We had some great times of sharing; choir, working at Hy-Vee (and having to wear those blue and white checked polyester smocks), boyfriend talks.  Having such a nice friend like you helped me to find my way in those times.  I thank both God and you.  I have been singing bluegrass music with a 4-piece band for about a year (isn't that a stretch of the imagination?), and there is a particular song which has given me hope for you and your family.  It's chorus, though a bit repetitive, is compelling:  &quot;Till the answer comes ya gotta keep praying, keep praying, keep praying. Keep praying till the answer comes.&quot;  And the last verse is such a good message: &quot;Sometimes you might be on your knees for hours before the light comes breaking through the dark.  But if you truly believe in His power to relieve, He'll lighten every troubled heart.&quot;  Your presence in the world, Jaci, has created such a warm light - from the way you treat others to the way they treat you.  What a lucky world it is to have you in it!  God bless you.
