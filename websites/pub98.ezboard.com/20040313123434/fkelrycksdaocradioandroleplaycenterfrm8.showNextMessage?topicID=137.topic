The moon should have been full and bright that night, but both moon and stars were obliterated by the roiling black clouds blanketing the sky.  Not even the oldest of the midwives could remember a storm such as this.  The frozen rain beat relentlessly against the shutters of the small cottage, but the windows and doors were barred against horrors far worse than any rain.<br>
<br>
Red's mother, Elmeara, clutched the newborn babe to her breast and tried in vain to soothe her son's cries.  She shivered uncontrollably; not from the cold, but from sheer terror.  Focusing on the child, she fought to suppress the panic rising inside her mind, and clawed at a thin grasp on sanity.  For what seemed like the hundredth time that night, she forced herself not to dwell on her husband, or to wonder what had become of him in the darkness.<br>
<br>
Despite Elmeara's best efforts, though, she could not quiet the babe.  This had been a difficult pregnancy, and an even more difficult birth; the midwives had cautioned many times that both child and mother could be lost in the delivery.  But Elmeara refused to let death cheat her, and the boy seemed unusually large and strong even for a highlander.  And now, despite his mother's attempts to soothe him, he wailed as though he felt the anguish of a thousand tortured souls, and screamed as if to compete with the shrieking wind outside.<br>
<br>
Elmeara whispered a prayer to the One God that the nightmare around her would turn out to be a nightmare in truth, and that she would awake to the world she remembered.  Humberton had been such a peaceful place then, a quiet and sleepy town where the keep atop the hill served more as a feast-hall than an actual fortress.  In those days, the men worked in the mines or fished in the bountiful Black Hills River, the women wove clothing and crafted jewelry of great renown, and the children played care-free in the grassy slopes surrounding the village.  Never was a door barred at night, never was a stranger turned away, and never was an angry word spoken in Council chambers in those happy times.<br>
<br>
But that was in the golden age of Arthur, and Arthur had fallen.  Now a dark age had come to Camelot, and with it came an evil heretofore unseen in Albion.  The trouble had started slowly at first: vague rumors of bandits and highwaymen, of guards who refused to go out on patrol, and of pagan rituals in the woods at night.  Good men who had never shirked a day's work became bitter and disillusioned, and sought solace in drink.  Women who had long been known for their wisdom and insight began having horrific nightmares, sometimes to the brink of insanity.  Children started to defy their elders, commit petty crimes and sometimes disappear altogether.  And Council members became mistrustful and suspicious, arguing amongst each other to the point of distraction.<br>
<br>
Then, three days ago, the storm had come, bringing with it a great evil that could no longer be denied.  The dark clouds that rolled in from the north cast a shadow that chilled strong men to the marrow.  Storekeepers closed up their shops and drew their shutters, and even the tavern closed its doors, though the mid-afternoon bell had not yet rung.  And it was just then that Elmeara had begun to feel the first pains of childbirth.<br>
<br>
Elmeara's daydream was suddenly broken by the sound of someone pounding on the door, nearly strong enough to loose it from its hinges.  Elmeara could hear voices bellowing, and though their words were drowned out by the gale, she instantly recognized the voice of her husband.  &quot;Steffon,&quot; she cried.  Placing the babe on a pillow, she rose from the bed; but the midwife was already unbarring the door.<br>
<br>
The sight of her husband sent Elmeara's emotions reeling.  Her joy and relief at Steffon returning alive was nearly overshadowed by the shock of seeing the man who now stood before her.  Steffon had always had an easy manner and a quick, ready laugh, but all traces of mirth had now vanished from his face.  He was covered from head to toe in dirt, soot and blood, and seemed to be limping on his left leg.  She was so astonished, she barely noticed her brother Jarray, who followed Steffon into the room, lowered himself heavily to the floor, and stared vacantly into the fire.<br>
<br>
Elmeara threw herself at her husband and wrapped her arms around his neck.  &quot;Thank God you're alive,&quot; she said, bursting into tears she could no longer hold back.  Steffon reacted slowly at first, then his arms engulfed her, holding her so tightly that Elmeara wondered if her ribs would break.  But she didn't care.  Steffon was back, he was alive, and everything was going to be all right again.  Steffon closed his eyes, buried his face in his wife's hair and inhaled deeply.  &quot;I thought I'd never see you again,&quot; he whispered at last.<br>
<br>
Steffon released his embrace, grasped Elmeara by the shoulders, and gently pushed her to arm's length, looking her up and down.  &quot;You're well, then?&quot; he asked, then gave a start.  A new look of concern covered his face.  &quot;You're thin again!  The babe…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is well!&quot; Elmeara replied, absentmindedly wiping away her tears.  &quot;He's big and strong, just like his father. He…&quot;  Elmeara's voice trailed off as she watched her husband's reaction.  Steffon had always wanted a large family, and though he claimed to favor daughters, Elmeara knew how badly he had wanted a son.  Yet now Steffon's face stiffened as he shifted his gaze to the infant on the pillow.<br>
<br>
&quot;My son,&quot; Steffon said coldly.  &quot;I have a son.&quot;  He strode to the bed and picked up the child, who had grown strangely quiet since his father's return.  As Steffon held the boy in his blood-soaked hands, his face twisted into rage and despair.  &quot;I have a son,&quot; he choked.<br>
<br>
This was hardly the reaction Elmeara had anticipated.  Her fear returned tenfold, and suddenly she didn't want Steffon to hold the child any longer.  &quot;Steffon, your hands!  He'll be covered in blood…&quot;  <br>
<br>
Steffon cut off her words with a snarl.  &quot;Aye, blood,&quot; he growled.  &quot;He'll be covered in blood.  Well, so be it, and he'd better get used to it.  Blood has been spilled this night, and more's to be spilled tomorrow, and more the day after that.   This lad will see more blood than a butcher's block afore he's got hair on his chin, else he'll not live to see that day, you mark my words.  Just pray to that God you're always talking about, woman.  Pray it's his enemy's blood he's covered in, and not his own.&quot;<br>

Steffon had always been a gentle man, forever striving to avoid conflict whenever it arose.  He was large and strong, and had learned as a child that he had to control his temper, or people could get hurt, and he never wanted anyone to get hurt.  Yet now his temper was out of control.  Unsure how to react, she tried to make light of the situation.  &quot;Surely you jest, Steffon!  And a foul jest it is too, you brute.  You know that the One God would never condone such bloodshed as that.  Nor would the man I married.&quot;<br>
<br>
Steffon turned to look at his wife.  Slowly, he put the child back down on the pillow.  As Elmeara looked into Steffon's eyes, she realized with horror that the man she had married had changed forever.  Gone was the twinkle in his eye that suggested an ever-impending joke.  Gone was the laughter from the corners of his mouth.  Gone was the proud stance that had spoken so loudly of righteousness.  She suddenly knew that her husband had lost much more of himself than he might ever recover.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you know?&quot; Steffon roared.  &quot;You don't know what's passed beyond these walls since the storm came upon us.  How nice it must have been for you, huddled here by a warm fire.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elmeara's joy at her husband's return changed abruptly to anger.  After all the anguish she had been through, after the tremendous pain of a difficult birth, after the torture of not knowing what had become of Steffon, she could not bear the suggestion that she had had an easy time of it.  &quot;What I know,&quot; she hissed, &quot;is that my husband left for the mine three days ago, and returns only now, smelling like a slaughterhouse.  I know that I, alone, brought our son into this world.  And I know that I'll never pray that our son should live a life of bloodshed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you do not know,&quot; Steffon replied quietly.  As suddenly as it had come, his fury seemed to fade away, replaced only by an empty bleakness.  &quot;My wife, the world we have known is gone.  The storm that rages outside these walls, it brought more than the rain.  It brought… goblins.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Goblins,&quot; Elmeara echoed, convinced now that her husband had lost his wits.  Goblins were a myth, a fantasy, a tale with which to frighten children when they misbehaved.  &quot;Goblins, is it?&quot;  Elmeara could not keep the sarcasm from her voice.  &quot;And perhaps Morgana herself has come with her minions to claim Avalon?&quot;  She tried to laugh at the very thought, but her laughter sounded hollow even to her own ears.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you mock me, woman?&quot;  Steffon asked sadly.  &quot;Aye, by all the gods old and new, 'twas goblins as attacked us in the mines.&quot;  He nodded his head at Jarray, who was still staring into the fire.  &quot;Don't believe me?  Ask your own brother.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elmeara shook her head in refusal.  &quot;Jarray?  Surely he has more sense than to…&quot;<br>
<br>
At the mention of his name, Jarray turned his head and looked at his sister, and the look in his eyes stopped Elmeara cold.  His eyes were… dead, was the only word she could think of.  She might as well have been looking into the eyes of a reanimated corpse as her own brother.  &quot;Goblins,&quot; Jarray croaked.  &quot;So many of them.  Too many.  We tried, we fought so hard, but…&quot;  Jarray's voice drifted off, and he resumed staring into the fire.<br>
<br>
Elmeara's mind whirled.  Surely, they couldn't both have gone mad.  Could they?  She struggled to control her emotions, and waited impatiently for her husband to continue.<br>
<br>
&quot;They came upon us in the mine.  The sentries never had a chance.  After all, what chance did they have?&quot;  Steffon barked a laugh.  It had long been well-known in Humberton that there was nothing to guard against at the mines, and only the oldest (and laziest) of the workers volunteered for sentry duty.  &quot;Like as not, they ended up in a Goblin cookpot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elmeara's stomach turned at the very idea.  &quot;I see,&quot; she replied.  &quot;And how did you defeat these… goblins?&quot;  Try as she might, she could not keep the incredulity from her voice.  This could not be true.  It couldn't!<br>
<br>
&quot;Still you don't believe, eh?  Well the answer is, we didn't defeat them.&quot;  Steffon's face hardened.  &quot;A contingent of men from the village came when we didn't report back at eventide bell.  Fortunately, they had the sense to come well-armed.  Jarray was part of that group.&quot;  Jarray turned his head vaguely toward Steffon at the mention of his name, but this time he said nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, the men of Humberton came to the mines.  Hundreds in number, they were.  And more than half were lost in the fight.&quot;  Steffon bowed his head in reverence, and his eyes took on a new light.  &quot;They helped us escape, but that is all they could do.  The goblins now control the mines, and most of the riverbank.  Many good men and true gave their lives so that we might have this conversation, woman, so listen well.&quot;  Steffon looked up, and the anguish in his face was plain.  &quot;They lost more than half their numbers,&quot; he continued, &quot;and we in the mines… only the fifth part of us survived.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My husband,&quot; Elmeara said in a quaking voice, &quot;please stop this jest, and tell me what really happened.  Goblins, indeed!&quot;  She could not believe this mad, fantastic tale.  Her mind just would not accept it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Goblins,&quot; Jarray muttered without looking away from the fire.  &quot;So many…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wife,&quot; said Steffon, &quot;light of my soul, you must accept…&quot;  Steffon took a step forward, then lurched to the side and steadied himself against a nearby table.<br>
<br>
Elmeara was shocked; never before had she seen her husband seek support of any kind.  Only then did she realize that some of the blood on Steffon's clothing was still fresh, and seemed to be coming from within.  She rushed forward, and held her husband upright just moments before he crashed to the floor.  &quot;You are wounded, and gravely!&quot; she cried.  &quot;Here, let me help you out of these filthy leathers.&quot;<br>
<br>
But Steffon regained his strength, and pushed Elmeara firmly away.  &quot;Nay,&quot; he said, &quot;I cannot tarry.  Good men are still dying as we speak, and I must return to the fight.&quot;  <br>
<br>
With that, Steffon bent down and pulled a dusty chest from beneath the cottage's only bed.  Opening the chest, he drew out a dull broadsword and a long, silver-worked stiletto.  He buckled the sword about his waist, then tucked the stiletto behind his belt.  &quot;I will return, my beloved.  That I swear to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Steffon hesitated, then strode to his wife and took her again into his arms.  This time, his embrace was not as strong as it was before; it was more gentle, more sensual, and more prolonged.  Steffon caressed his wife's back and shoulders, and Elmeara had the sudden sensation that he was memorizing every touch.  They kissed, and Elmeara knew in her soul that this was still her husband, still the man she had married.<br>
<br>
Slowly they parted, and Steffon turned toward the door.  Elmeara knew Steffon well enough to realize she could not keep him from walking out that door.  But still she could not accept it, and her mind scrambled for something to say that would keep him at home.  &quot;What of your hearth, your home, your family?&quot; she cried, &quot;what of your newborn son?&quot;<br>
<br>
That stopped Steffon in his tracks.  Slowly he turned and looked into Elmeara's eyes.  His face spoke of a tremendous conviction.  He set his jaw, removed the stiletto from his belt, and pressed it into Elmeara's hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;This,&quot; he said, &quot;is for my son.  Swear to me that he learns to use it well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; cried Elmeara, &quot;Stay and see to it yourself, if you wish it so much.&quot;<br>
<br>
But Steffon would not be deterred.  &quot;Wife of my heart, light of my soul, I have but one wish.  Swear to me now, to the One God, that our son will learn to use this weapon to fight the enemies of Albion!&quot;<br>
<br>
Elmeara finally felt her grasp on sanity slip away.  Vaguely, she felt her hand close around the stiletto, and heard herself say, &quot;Yes, light of my soul, by the One God I swear it.  Our son will learn to use this weapon in defense of Albion.&quot;  She could not recall speaking the words, yet she knew it was her own voice that had spoken them.<br>
<br>
Steffon nodded, and straightened as though a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders.  &quot;May you remain safe, wife, until we meet again, whether here in this cottage or above in heaven.&quot;  Steffon laughed, and for a heartbeat Elmeara thought she truly recognized her husband.  Then he sobered once again.  &quot;Come, Jarray, let us away,&quot; Steffon called, and together the two of them went out into the night.<br>
<br>
Elmeara never saw either of them again.<br>
