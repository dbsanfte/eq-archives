<br>
Background is a regular is frustrated because her brother's LDS girlfriend was forced to dump him because of his atheism. My response was basically that prohibition on dating atheists or even non-sect theists is NOT unusual and should not lead anyone to be surprised and that indeed--<br>
<br>
&quot;teaching children intolerance based on belief systems is EXACTLY what religion (xianity in particular) is all about so you shouldn't be surprised&quot;<br>
<br>
We have touched on the intolerance of xianity many times here, but I see the teaching of this to children and enforcement of religious guidelines/proscriptions as the core issue. <br>
For the record I believe in religious liberty and do think theists have the same rights to teach their children as they believe...so is this guy wrong for forbidding his LDS daughter (at age 15 just a few short years from entering her sacred marriage and beginning the breeding process on her way to a heavenly family on planet ruled by priestly dh) to date non LDS? NO--he's just living his religion and making his kids do the same and she can reject this later in life. He as every right to embrace an intolerant, bigoted mythology and pass this off as truth to his children, so let's stay away from whether he has a right to indoctrinate his offspring--clearly he does as we all do. The core issue, as I've said is whether xianity breeds intolerance and whether teaching it to children = teaching religious based intolerance.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The thread on the biblical support of wiccans touches on the fact that Christianity teaches the Golden Rule, do unto to others as you would have done unto you. Love your neighbors as you love yourself<br>
<br>
It teaches that we are to respect the right of others to live as they choose.  It teaches that we should love all men and not treat others badly because they dont believe like we do.<br>
<br>
That said, it also teaches that marrying people who believe like you do makes marriage alot easier ( I think we have discussed that idea already)<br>
<br>
I teach the 16-18 year olds in sunday school and I have several teen nieces and nephew (several of whom live outside of Utah where there are not alot of LDS around)<br>
<br>
The advice I give to them is that the reason you should only date LDS people ISN'T because LDS have a corner on the only nice people out there, it is precisely the opposite.  There are plenty of great people who are not LDS BUT you marry who you date. And if you date and fall in love with a person who isnt LDS then you can't get married in the temple.  On top of that, religion especially for LDS is a huge thing and to not have that in common with the person you spend your life with can only add stress to marriage.  <br>
<br>
So if you want to marry in the temple then it is best to date only LDS who hold the same values because you dont know who your going to fall in love with.  Why risk falling in love with someone who cant take you where you want to go.<br>
<br>
I admit my parents were very lax and my brothers,my sister and I dated who we wanted to and I dated about half LDS and half not.  Two guys I dated that at one time I was very serious about were 1. Catholic and 2. an inactive LDS who didnt have the same values and ideals that I have.  The Catholic was actually  forced to break up with me by HIS mother <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  because I was making him question his own religion, and #2 I broke his heart after we had talked about marriage because I knew that there were issues that were not resolvable. (Broke my heart too)  <br>
<br>
My sister married a guy who wasnt LDS but he was abusive and she later left (this is not a reflection on his religious choice, He was just a jerk period)<br>
<br>
I think marriage is tough enough at times without something as big as religion to disagree about. - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FEFEFE><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> sweetpeas mommy</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#5F9EA0>(8/13/03 7:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=240.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   my .02</span><hr size=1> If it was the girl choosing to end the relationship because she didn't see their values as compatible, then I think I would see that as good sense. We all make such choices while dating because if you are going to be in a relationship, potentially for the rest of your life and potentially raising children together, holding the same values...whether those values stem Christianity, Islam, secular humanism, Hinduism, or whatever will likely help you to have a better relationship.<br>
<br>
When I was dating, I limited myself to mainline Christians because they were people who shared the value system I wanted to live my life by. But that wasn't the only criteria I had...I would not have continued a relationship with someone who told me he did not want to have children either...because I wanted to have children and I think it's important to agree on that aspect of your relationship. After all, there is no middle ground, you either have kids or you don't.<br>
<br>
Now in this situation, the parents seem to be making the choice for the girl. While as Stacy pointed out, that is their right, it is not the way I would choose to parent. Especially at 15, forbiding the relationship is likely to backfire anyway, so for me, I would encourage my dd to think about what she is looking for from a relationship (does she want to get married, have kids, etc.) and then think about the values she thinks are important to share based on what you want in the future (not just at 15). <br>
<br>
I had friends who were very strict religiously and in every other way and usually those kids ended up rejecting the system their parents wanted them to embrace. So unless we viewed the relationship as a threat to our child's safety, I don't think my dh and I would forbid it outright, though we would encourage her to think about what she is looking for. <br>
<br>
But we also don't know the whole situation either...maybe the parents didn't like the kid's attitude...maybe he told them he thought their religion was crap...or maybe the parents just are  overly strict. Who knows.<br>
<br>
But I don't think in general that dating or not dating a person based on whether they share your religious or other values is inherently intolerant. And if it is, I suspect it is an intolerance we all have -- Christian or not. I doubt I would have had a very good marriage if I had married an atheist who did not want me to raise our children Christian just as Shirene would not have had a happy marriage outside the LDS temple and just as I doubt Stacy would have been very happy married to a Born Again Christian who wanted to raise any children to accept Jesus.<br>

What I mean is, one doesn't need a Bible to be a bigoted asshole, but the Bible can be interpreted by some in such a way as to give a cover or an excuse for one's bigotry.  In the same way, the Bible can be interpreted by some in such a way as to encourage the acceptance and embracing of a minority group.  Xianity is a tool whereby individuals can manipulate the thinking of some who already have a propensity to be hateful and intolerant.  But I don't think Xianity does by default encourage intolerance.  We've spoken before about how contradictory and wishy-washy Biblical teachings are, and so I think the Bible itself lacks the conviction to be a racist manifesto.<br>

<br>
Now while both xians who responded said the didn't specifically prohibit dating another faith, I do think it's interesting to note that Kerrie-Anne did say<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So unless we viewed the relationship as a threat to our child's safety, I don't think my dh and I would forbid it outright,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
and it's exactly the threat to a child's salvation and spiritual path that I think these LDS parents and others such as the JW's have in mind when prohibiting social contact or dating with other faiths. I know Kerrie you may not be talking about this, but surely it would disturb you if your daughter dated a guy you thought was going to burn in hell for more reasons than that they would have epistomological disagreements...<br>
I might worry as an atheist too, but I wouldn't see it as a threat to my dd's immortal sould or the spiritual path of her children and so perhaps that's why I see those of other faiths as less threatening and therefore am more tolerant (also I am not following the commands of an intolerant god, but that's a given<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
And Kerrie-Anne--<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But I don't think in general that dating or not dating a person based on whether they share your religious or other values is inherently intolerant.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have to agree with this generally and that marrying someone who shares your views seems wise, but I think the dating thing was a springboard to the real question which was whether religion teaches intolerance. We can go to public schools, politics, social situations etc. to find MANY examples of xian intolerance from prohibitions on gay unions to forced prayer/pledges to god in schools to publicly funded xian prayers and celebrations. This same monetary and social support is simply not afforded other religions or atheists for that matter and xian children are indeed taught that they are “saved” or worse that they are saved while others will burn eternally in hell. It may be argued xians are merely following the guidelines of an intolerant deity, but it is still intolerance whether dictated “from above” or derived from man. I don’t see any refutation of this so far.<br>
<br>
The Golden Rule would mean it would be okay and perhaps ethical for me to beat you if I am a masochist or encourage you to do cocaine if I would like the same. I could extrapolate this into gay marriage/rights, women's rights/roles, SOCAS etc. It's the reason so many xians feel proselytizing and missionary work is justifiable--besides following another of god's commandments to expand the religion and witness, xians feel they would want someone to proselytize to them so it's okay to do it to others. They want someone to pray in school and use their tax money to pledge to their god so it's okay to do it to my children with my money (this never seems to work the other way, but it still follows the spirit of the Golden Rule.<br>
No--give me the Wiccans and their (is it the Silver Rule?) Creed which asks that you not do unto others as you would not have done unto you. I would NOT like my tax money spent to force religious instruction not of my choosing on my child and force her to pray to a false god...my bet is xians would NOT want this either (Imagine a prayer to Satan every school morning<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ...If only they could follow the Wiccan Creed...but see the Wiccans don't believe we will burn in hell forever or be rejected eternally from salvation by a vengeful god with a rudimentary and barbaric justice system so that right there makes them more tolerant.<br>

Where are the atheists running for office?  Where are the humanist organizations advertising and organizing?  Where is the Million Atheists March?  That atheists (and, again, some other minority faiths) are not as well organized as Xian sects is a product of philosophy (that you don't advertise your beliefs or try to convert others) and a disparity of beliefs and practises, as well as the threat of discrimination that causes some to stay &quot;in the closet&quot;.  While I believe Xians have abused their power in many places (including Washingston DC), I wouldn't blame Xianity for being crafty enough to insert a clause from the outset that requires its followers to give money to their church and spread the word.<br>
<br>
We've brought up the subject of tax exemptions for churches before, and there are also several humanist and freethinking organizations that have applied for and received that same tax-exempt status.  As for the Faith-Based Initiative and other crap being concocted by our Fundie-in-Chief--yes, it sucks, but the only way to eliminate this kind of discrimination is to work within the system--write to representatives, support candidates who share your views on this, be vocal in your community.  Public schools will only get away with school prayer if no one speaks up (and puts in a call to the ACLU).  We're not going to change the Xian faith (though personally I believe it's slowly on its way out), so we can forget about that.  A/A's need better organization and more publicity if they want to counter-attack the fundie right movement.  Teaming up with moderate-to-liberal Jewish and Xian groups who also carry the SOCAS banner and oppose institutionalized discrimination wouldn't be such a bad idea either.

I told you what Christianity teaches about the way you should treat others.  Are there some Christians who are intolerant? YES Just as their are Atheists, Muslims, Jews etc who are intolerant.  <br>
<br>
EVERYTHING Jesus Christ taught was about loving your neighbor, praying for those who are consciously trying to hurt you, not judging (that is God's alone) visiting the sick, taking care of the widows. Forgiving those who have offended you.  I dont see how any of that can be misconstrued as being intolerant.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, while not being intolerant of individuals, we do judge actions and behaviors and right and wrong and have the responsibility to speak out against things that we see as corrupting society as a whole.  If we were to be tolerant of EVERY behavior, we would have to just &quot;accept&quot;  thieves, rapists, people who assault others, pedophiles etc.  Are we Intolerant because we see these as problem behaviors? No.<br>
<br>
There are some things that we do not accept as OK behaviors, even if the rest of the world does.  Does that make us intolerant? Of the behavior or action, yes.  But that should NOT affect the way we interact or treat others on an individual basis.  <br>
<br>
A good example... Smoking.  I dont like it.  I think its a gross habit and addictive. I also know that every person has a right to choose whether or not to smoke.  I shouldnt treat a person badly because he chooses to smoke.  My grandma smoked all her life.  I didnt like it, but it didnt make me love her any less.  I didnt avoid visiting her because she smoked. But that doesnt mean I can't  be vocal about smoking laws and lobby to get no smoking in public places. <br>
<br>
I think there are things that every person feels passionately about.  Things that we disgree with other people about.  We can even get involved and try to make sure our voice is heard.  Whether it is the issue of Gay marriage or saving the rain forrest.   That does not mean on an individual basis we can't have a respectful pleasant relationship with the person with whom we disagree. - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#EFEFEF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=monynh>monyNH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(8/13/03 9:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=240.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I think we're still missing the core issue </span><hr size=1> You'll have to excuse me for hogging the board tonight--I obviously have nothing better to do (yeah, right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>

I have to seriously wonder how you can have a &quot;respectful pleasant relationship&quot; with someone you believe is fundamentally abnormal, for which you would withhold those basic life choices that we take for granted--sexual fulfillment, marriage, children.  Perhaps you believe you are being respectful toward them because you don't stand around holding up &quot;God hates f***&quot; picket signs; but I doubt they would agree.<br>

<br>
And I do not think my upbringing (very Christian) taught those things at all. My parents are highly liberal &quot;social justice&quot; Catholics, if any of you are familiar with that term, and I think they used the phrase &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot; before it gained such popularity. My brothers and I heard that phrase often growing up when we had a question about how to behave and it was always used to mean, &quot;Is that the way you should treat another person?&quot;<br>
<br>
It is that upbringing and my Christian values that stem from it that make me anti-death penalty, pro-SOCAS, makes me despise racism, sexism and homophobia. Your definitions of intolerance &quot;unable or unwilling to endure&quot; and &quot;unwilling to grant equal freedom of expression especially in religious matters&quot; and &quot;unwilling to grant or share social, political, or professional rights&quot; are completely opposite how I was raised.<br>
<br>
Are there things in society I disagree with? You bet. Pornography is a good example...I think it is disgusting and degrading, especially to women, BUT as someone who wholeheartedly believes in SOCAS and the first amendment, I know that people have a right to create it and look at it. And I have the right to say it is disgusting and degrading. I don't think being tolerant means that I have to like everything I see, just that I cannot infringe on someone else's right to live their life.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I realize my experience is anecdotal only, but I do think it is an example of Christian parents who did not teach intolerance...because as I said, I believe intolerant people teach intolerance...be they Christian or not.<br>

PS. On the dating example, I meant my dd's physical safety as in did I think she might be raped, killed in a drunk driving accident because her boyfriend drank and got behind the wheel of a car etc. THe state of her soul is a function of more than who she dates and ultimately is not a choice I can make for her. <br>
<br>
Plus, as I said, I think forbidding relationships like the parents did tends to encourage them more than anything. I would much rather my dd be raised to think critically about what she wants and which relationships are likely to fall in line with that. After all, I may be able to somewhat control her actions at 15 but once she hits adulthood, she's more or less on her own and my job (and my husband's job) in parenting her is to teach her how to handle herself when that time comes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FEFEFE><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=monynh>monyNH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(8/14/03 11:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=240.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: intolerance</span><hr size=1> &quot;Are you telling me that everyone you work with or live by that has different ideals as you, you avoid and have nothing to do with them and are constantly making snyde remarks or harrassing them for being different from you?&quot;<br>

I'm not saying that at all.  I can be as friendly to those with whom I disagree as you are.  The difference is that I don't seek to deny them their basic civil rights.  You may admire the lesbian that you work with, but the fact remains that you would oppose her marrying her partner and you may well oppose their raising a child together (I can't remember your stance on that issue).  I'm sure that fifty years ago there were plenty of of people who were friendly to blacks, but that is small consolation when those same people supported segregation.<br>

In November of last year I was just 3 months pregnant. I am on government payed health insurance so I had to go to the clinic downtown for my checkups.  One tuesday afternoon on my way out of the clinic, walking to my car, I was accosted by a bunch of picket sign touting god freaks.  They actually shoved me around calling me a &quot;heretic whore&quot; and a murderer.  The brain dead idiots assumed that because I was walking out of the clinic I was having an abortion.  Don't get me wrong, I was considering it for a while but I didn't do it, nor would I had I the choice to make again.  When a woman has an abortion it is a decision she lives with for the rest of her life, she is having enough inner turmoil without having some god freaks attack her.  Even if I was what business is it of theirs to assault me or anyone else.  I know not all xians are like that but those that are more than make up for it.  What of the geniuses that throw pipe bombs into clinics?  I don't think they are showings gos's supposedly infinite patience.  They are hurting innocent people trying to make money for their families and women and children that are just there for normal visits.  I know in my town the clinic has one day a week it does abortions so as not to endanger the health of other people, whats that say for xians and other religious zealots?  I think they are all a bunch of barbarians looking for something to hold in front of them to create wars.  I don't go into their churches hanging flyers saying &quot;Your god is dead, wake up and get on with your lives.&quot;  Yet they hang graphic images of unborn fetuses on their signs and scream murder.  How many people were murdered in any of those religious wars?  I bet a whole hell of a lot more than women that have abortions.  Maybe they are trying to make up for it by saving others.  Hypocrits, pure and simple.  It's ok for them to rush off and kill as many people as they want in the name of their god but its not ok for a woman to say &quot;Hey I am not going to be able to give this kid a good life.&quot; or &quot;This baby has a birth defect, I don't want to make them suffer their whole lives.&quot;  Where is the mercy there?  And why do xians almost always insist on keeping people on life support as long as possible?  Aren't they eager for their loved ones to go meet their god?  From what I have seen they are just selfish,wanting to hold on to that person, no matter what their suffering, for just a little while longer. <br>
<br>
Sorry that got kind of long hehe.  I just get really pissed off when I think about that.  That was just the stand out incident where I was the subject to religious intolerance, there were many more instances throughout my life.  How many instances of atheist intolerance do you hear?  Do I picket your churches and sinegogs?  Do I pull your children asside and tell them what is &quot;right&quot;?  Do I leave atheistic pamplets in your mail slot hoping one day you will see the light?  I don't think so.  I have what is commonly known as respect.  Go ahead and believe in your god.  Go to church and sing hymns, but don't come to my house expecting me to do it.  Don't stop me and hand me a paper and tell me to read it. <br>
Ok I'll stop now hehe.<br>

It's English, not Latin. It's a living language. That means that definitions can change. If we change our laws to allow gays to marry, than &quot;marriage&quot; will mean &quot;an institution whereby two adults are joined.&quot; <br>
<br>
Websters doesn't create the meaning, it simply <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>reports</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it. Change the law and Websters will follow.<br>

The difference between you &quot;not budging&quot; on gay marriage and a vegan &quot;not budging&quot; on animal products is, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the vegan isn't trying to legally FORCE you and everyone else to stop using animal products.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The vegan is minding her own business, saying &quot;I personally choose not to eat animal products because I think it's wrong.&quot; Just as you didn't marry another woman because you think it's wrong. <br>
<br>
That's very different from saying that those who think it's right should be legally blocked from marrying the person they love, so that religious people can force their religion's restrictions on non-adherents.

Hmmm...only when it's followers totally ignore the bible's own teachings or try to brush certain undesirable or uglier ones aside...allow me to point to the old testament since there is so much talk of homosexuality. If you are going to use the OT to condemn this behavior you must also use it for these other rather interesting things...<br>
<br>
Anyone who curses or blasphemes God, should be stoned to death by the community.  (Leviticus 24:14-16)<br>
<br>
Leviticus 20:13 clearly states &quot;If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Psychics, wizards, and so on are to be stoned to death.  (Leviticus 20:27)<br>
Anyone who dreams or prophesizes anything that is against God, or anyone who tries to turn you from God, is to be put to death. (Deuteronomy 13:5)<br>
If anyone, even your own family suggests worshipping another God, kill them. (Deuteronomy 13:6-10)<br>
If you find out a city worships a different god, destroy the city and kill all of it's inhabitants... even the animals. (Deuteronomy 13:12-15)<br>
Kill anyone with a different religion. (Deuteronomy 17:2-7)<br>
<br>
There are NT instances of sexism and racism as well and we could go into the BOM, but that's just too damn easy with it's blatant sexism and racism. Fact is the bible teaches...indeed commands it's followers to not only be intolerant but act on this in violent ways. If we are going to start ignoring parts of it here and there let's be clear about which books we are ignoring and maybe we can throw out the homosexuality as a no-no altogether and start eating pork and shellfish again<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Of course we’re not talking about intolerance of criminal activities with victims such as pedophilia, rape, murder and theft either--we are talking about the crime of holding beliefs different than your own that do not harm you in any way (take homosexuality for example, atheism, being a witch).<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong--my life and the lives of my children depend on modern xianity largely ignoring their god's calls for blood and violence. I just don't see this any differently than a gay priest saying he is this religion and following this book and then wanting to change or &quot;interpret&quot; the rules.

- Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.  <br>
<br>
1st Corinthians 7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>every man have his own wife</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and let <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>every woman have her own husband</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.... verses 8-9 I say therefore to the unmarried and the widows, it is good for them if they abide even as I, but if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.<br>
<br>
See they want the loophole of calling the un-natural union a marriage, so it won't be a sin.  You can't do that.<br>
<br>
I understand that you dont get it, but a priest should.  He knows the scriptures, He understands that the only person who can change &quot;god's rules&quot; is God.  So despite personal feelings, the rules are the rules.  My dh loves BEER.  If it were up to him beer would be the exception to the word of wisdom.  But it isnt up to him, It is God's law.  So he can either choose to follow it or not, but he can't just change the rules to suit his personal preference.<br>
<br>
Sex only in a marriage between a man and a woman is God's law.  Choose to live it or dont, but don't try to change God's law based on personal desires and still call it his law.  It the priest changed the law it would be &quot;Priest Bob&quot; 's law, not God's.<br>
<br>
I already stated that if they want to create a new catagory, a new type of homosexual legal commitment, go right ahead, just dont call it marriage. <br>
<br>
How did this thread turn into another debate on homosexuality?<br>
<br>
Please read the new testament and show me where it teaches intolerance.  <br>
<br>
No one addressed the idea of smoking and not treating a smoker differently because he smokes and yet still being vocal about smoking laws.  DO you agree? disagree? you dont want to comment because it might undermine your position that we (Christians) are intolerant and hate people because we speak out on political or public issues that we feel strongly about.  One doesnt equal the other.<br>
<br>
What is it that you feel strongly about? If a person disagreed with you on that topic would you think you were being intolerant of them because you speak your mind in the political process.  Am I not allowed to speak my mind BECAUSE I am Christian?  I am not buying it.  -- Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FEFEFE><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=har1eyquinn>hAr1EyQuiNn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(8/15/03 8:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=240.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: intolerance</span><hr size=1> So let me get this straight, not only is it ok for xians to try to force their way into our schools and our homes but now they want to have marriage all to themselves? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Sounds like a bunch o' crap to me.  If I were gay I'd be pretty damn offended.  In a gay relationship there is usually a &quot;husband&quot; role and a &quot;wife&quot; role.  The same fits for lesbian marriages.  How would your lesbian friends feel if you protested their marriage?  I bet they wouldn't be too happy bout that.<br>
Personally marriage doesn't mean anything to me, its a piece of paper stating what everyone already knows.  Person A loves Person B and they want to spend the rest of their lives together.  But I would never go around telling people they shouldn't get married, its their choice and their genders should have nothing to do with it.<br>
The problem with almost all religions is that they hang on to the past, they cling to their outdated beliefs and standards.  Times have changed, its not the year 200 anymore.  Its time to move on and grow up.  Live in the past and your going to repeat it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#EFEFEF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> sweetpeas mommy</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#5F9EA0>(8/15/03 9:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=240.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   gay marriage</span><hr size=1> On the gay marriage issue, (though I too, didn't expect this to morph into that discussion) the idea of gay civil unions doesn't really bother me...they're already legal in NH, aren't they? And in Canada and some European countries too. The way I see it, whether you call it marriage or civil unions, it would be the government recognizing relationships that already exist, and I think it will happen.<br>
<br>
The debate within Christianity on whether homosexuality is a sin, etc. will rage on and regardless of what the government does, I think the situation within Christianity will be the same as it is now...some churches/ministers will do them and some won't. Either way, whether Tim and Mike are married/have a civil union whatever, in no way changes my marriage or makes it any less religiously significant to me, so I am not losing sleep over it.<br>
<br>
As for the OT/NT stuff, I think that discussion has happened millions of times (okay, maybe just thousands!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) on here before. While I respectfully disagree with Stacy's assessment, I don't have anything new to add to that debate.<br>
