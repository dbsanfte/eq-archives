First off, it’s completely doable.  And secondly, there are so many reasons to do it.<br>
<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’re bored at your desk job. So bored, that you’re putting on stage plays with your office supplies.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’ve always wanted to know how they cram all those clowns into that tiny car, and you’re willing to go to extremes to uncover the truth.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You come from a long line of jugglers and your parents would be very disappointed in you if you got a real job.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’re searching for a new boy/girlfriend, and those limber people on the flying trapeze are looking pretty good.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’ve decided it’s time to put your five nipples to use.  Hey, you’ve been called a freak all your life; why not get paid for it?<br>
<br>
Bottom line: You’ve always wanted to do it and now we’re telling you that you can.  So (cue booming announcer voice): “Ladies and Gentlemen…Kids of all ages…we present you with the Freakiest Show on Earth!”  Please don’t throw peanuts.<br>
<br>
Before we move on to the actual process of joining the circus, we must first shatter some illusions.  Life with the Cirque du Nocturne is not actually as carefree or glamorous as it may appear.  True, it’s a little more carefree and glamorous than, say, being a paralegal, but it involves lots of hard work and sacrifice too.  Here are some things to expect:<br>
<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You’ll be expected to put on a smile (metaphorically speaking, of course.  This is a Gothik circus after all), and work every week night, weekends and some holidays, through fatigue and bad moods, even when there are only five people in the audience.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After each show type is over, you pack up, move to a new town and learn a whole new routine all over again.  This happens several times a year.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You may end up getting more tattoos and body piercings/modifications than you originally intended.  At least they will be paid for by the Cirque, though.<br>
<br>
The upside to all of this is that you’ll get to see the world (or at least the country), and the awe and applause of the audience will gratify your narcissism to no end.  Plus, because of their nomadic lifestyle, circus people form tight-knit communities.  So if you join the circus, you’ll inherit a very special family of weirdos.  Maybe you’ll even get a date.<br>
<br>
Highly-specialized circus talents needed for Gothik Cirque du Nocturne<br>
<br>
The following circus occupations are ones that you've probably never tried before because they're not popular hobbies or your average after-school lessons. The fact is that unless you are intensely determined, you probably can't get one of these jobs. But who are we to stand in the way of your foolish dreams? <br>
<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trapeze artist. If you are somebody who yawns on roller coasters, you're perfect for the trapeze. Keep in mind, however, that you'll have to develop your arm muscles and get over your bitter distrust of coworkers. <br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tightrope walker. Funambulism (tightrope-walking's fancier name) started off as &quot;rope-dancing&quot; and used to be performed over knives. Just be thankful that the profession has evolved. Hmmm, well come to think of it, what would be cooler than walking a thin rope over a bed or running chainsaws?  I guess we’ve devolved the profession somewhat, cause we think the idea of potentially falling to your death on sharp pointy things in front of an audience is kinda cool in a sick, entertaining way.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fire breather/Eater. Okay, to set the record straight, we don't advocate you looking for any job that involves shoving a burning stick down your throat (unless we're getting a cut of your stipend). But because we're here to educate and not coddle, we offer training in firebreathing, (with useful tips such as: &quot;make sure no one is standing in front of you when you firebreathe;&quot; and &quot;get the address of the nearest intensive care unit before you start&quot;). <br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tattooed Contortionist Freak. A genetic predisposition is sort of required (as well as a liberal dose of ink). <br>
Less-specialized circus talents<br>
Many people already possess the ability to juggle, work with animals, or do impressive flips. If you're one of these people, you have a great advantage over the average wannabe circus performer and should look into developing your talent.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Stilt Walker. If you've tried it and you're a natural, you have our blessing to make a career out of stilt walking. It's fun and it makes you taller. What more do you need?<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Clown. You find that people frequently laugh and point- you're already halfway there! Especially if your fashion sense includes things like straps, spikes and collars.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Unicycler. Any unicycler will attest to this: once you've mastered just one wheel, you can never go back to two. It's not nearly as hard as it seems, although here at the Cirque du Nocturne, our unicyclists frequently have to juggle flaming brands, chainsaws, or even flaming chainsaws.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Juggler. So you know how to juggle three balls, eh? Wimp. Don't call the Cirque until you've mastered the art of juggling axes, bowling balls, babies, and flaming torches (and we're talkin' at the same time). <br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Acrobat. Just 'cause you can do two cartwheels in a row doesn't mean you're circus material. If you're dreaming of becoming a professional acrobat, you've hopefully been taking gymnastics classes since you were one and a half. Many people are limber - you've got to be better and than all of them.<br>
<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And if all else fails…<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ringmaster. A good ringmaster possesses the ability to command the attention of a crowd and excite people, but we're going to let you in on a little secret: it's basically just public speaking in a tent. If you have a booming voice and a sense of the theatrical, it might be perfect.  But if you’re a shy Goth with little self esteem, this may not be the best choice for you.  Maybe you could learn to juggle.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Roustabout. If all the occupations listed above sound too dangerous, too daunting, or just too weird for you, consider getting a job as a roustabout. Roustabouts are the people who put up the tents, drive the buses, feed the clowns, etc. They play very important roles in the circus, even though they never show up in the center ring. They're the handymen and handywomen. <br>
<br>
Enough of that preliminary stuff; here's the part you've been waiting for. Again, we remind you that before you can get a circus job, you need talent and training, so if you skipped reading the above information, go back and read them, cheater.<br>
 <br>
Once you've got your act down pat, it's time to audition.<br>
<br>
We are holding open auditions for any possible act you can come up with as long as it is Gothik in nature.  We are not looking for splatter shows, gruesome body mutilation or erotic performance art.  We do after all have to entertain children, but it can be dark, scary and unsettling.  So if you think you qualify, then give us a call and set up an appointment.  1-800-NOCTURN and ask for Thibault.<br>
<br>
And now you're ready to join the circus. Go to it, Bozo! (That, of course, is a circus compliment.)<br>
