<br>
I was going to post this on the submission thread, but since it has nothing to do with that topic, I thought I'd start a new one here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I am still left wondering, if the OT law was abolished, and the NT law is all we need, and as your article points out and CEREMONIAL law is worthless, how does this reconcile with the first 3 commandments since they are all ceremonial as well? The answer that I think I know is that you selectively apply the bible to your life.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I didn't read the entire article that Heather posted ... so I cannot comment on ceremonial law, etc. But I posted the beginning of this earlier on the JS thread to explain the abolishment of food restrictions (shellfish, pork, etc). I'll also add about abstaining from sex. First the food:<br>
<br>
In Acts, chapter 10, Peter has a vision while on a roof top praying. &quot; ... he fell into a trance adn saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth. In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. And a voice came to him, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.' But Peter said, 'Not so, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.' And a voice spoke to him again the second time, 'What God has cleansed you must not call common.' This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.&quot; (Acts 10:11-16) God was telling Peter that these foods that had once been unclean were now alright to eat of; He was also telling Peter that it was alright to keep company with Gentiles, who were also viewed as &quot;unclean&quot; by devout Jews. Later, in the book of Romans, Paul addresses this issue as well. &quot;Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for the man who eats with offense. It is good neither to eat meat nor drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is made weak.&quot; (Romans 14:19-21) Basically, Paul is reaffirming that food is no longer seen as &quot;unclean,&quot; but the person eating or drinking needs to take into account those they are with - if their food or drink will offend or cause another to stumble, then it is best to abstain while dining with that person. And finally, from the Man Himself: &quot;He said to them, 'Hear and understand: 'Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of him mouth, this defiles a man.'&quot; (Matthew 15:11) Jesus was telling the Jews of His day that it is not the food that makes them unclean, but rather their words, and if you read further, their hearts that make them unclean. <br>
<br>
Okay, sex: Paul writes in 1 Corintians 7: &quot;Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise, also the wife to her husband. ... Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. But I say this as a concession, not as a commandment.&quot; (vs. 2-3, 5-6) Husbands and wifes are to give themselves to each other, including sexually. Instead of falling into temptation (lust, sexual immorality, pornography, etc), if spouses would be attuned to the sexual needs of their partner, and lovingly &amp; willingly satisfy each other's sexual needs, then they can withstand any temptation to sin. <br>
<br>
Both of these restrictions, from the OT times, were given by God to prevent His people from falling victim to illness and disease. Many of the &quot;commands&quot; given in the OT were to direct the Israelites towards healthy and righteous living. They would be considered proper conduct for living a life pleasing to God. The Ten Commandments still hold to this day - which as Jesus stated, can be summed up into two commandments: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, and soul; and love your neighbor as yourself. If you do those two things, then the others fall into place. Jesus' life exemplified those two commands and we are to follow His example. You are right; there are many &quot;regulations&quot; that fall into the category of &quot;law&quot; in the Bible that most all Christians today do not worry with nor practice. As pointed out, some have been redefined by God; others, we don't practice from chioce. Does this mean a person who has accepted Christ, His death, His atonement, and His resurrection will not be saved? No. Our salvation does not have to do with whether we wear clothing of blended thread (which if you look at that in a practical sense, clothing made of blended thread will wear out unevenly, wasting the thread and the garment). Our salvation rests on Christ alone. The church in Galatia was having a very hard time trying to keep the Law, believing that deviating from it would affect their salvation. Paul writes to them: &quot;Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given eternal life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. But before faith came, we were kept nder guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are not longer under a tutor.&quot; (Galatians 3:21-25) Paul points out elsewhere in his letters that the Law served to show us our sin and show us the need for a Savior. Think about it - who could ever fulfill all of the laws, regulations and commands of the OT? None of us. The law, then, shows us our shortcomings and impresses upon us the need for someone else to get us back to righteousness and holiness. The someone is Christ. We trust in Christ to be our salvation and then try our darndest to keep His commands - summed up by the two greatest - Love God and love our neighbor as ourself. <br>
<br>
I am sorry this has gotten a little long. Hopefully it will help you see our perspective - not expecting you to agree or accept any of it. I agree with Heather (I think she posted it) that people who are not of God cannot understand the things of God - you must be able to step out on faith first in Him befoe any of the rest of it makes a hill of beans.<br>

The 'people who are not of god' crap is overly condescending and a sham to hide behind.  I have spoken to far too many theists who hide behind that neener-neener-neener pretext that knew far less 'of god' than I do.  They have either never read the bible, or feebly accepted without examination the explanations fed to them, but they certainly never examined it themselves.

OK, so peter has this vision and the face of xiandom is changed.  How is this different from John Smith and his visions and why, if the message is worth sending 3 times was it sent all three times to the same guy?  How do you discern this from a Satanic deception?  Doesn't it strike you as odd that all these things that prevent gentiles from conversion are magically scrubbed away the instant peter is faced with converting them?  How about the point you made regarding all the laws being impossible to follow?  Does that not equate to entrapment by god when he sets a catch-22?  Even paul does not speak to the food tabboo directly or even in the authority of god.  As he says, &quot;I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but it is unclean for any one who thinks it unclean.&quot; His opinion.  This chapter is about getting along with others and not being judgemental.  The work of god you are not to threaten is the peace among men as brothers, not the piece of meat on a plate.  Specifically, &quot;But he who has doubts is condemned, if he eats, because he does not act from faith; for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.&quot; (Ro. 14:23) Clearly, if you know the law, you know the sin and must abstain.  This is an absolution for those ignorant of the law (Gentiles), not those who break it in knowledge.  Lastly, from THE MAN himself (heh) the context you take it from does not address the food tabboo.  It addresses the use of tradition as something godly when it isn't.  The Pharisees were upset at JC's minions not washing their hands.  JC claimed it was their tradition, not god's regarding hand washing.  He said what goes into the mouth (dirty hands) was not the measure of an evil heart, but what comes out (words).<br>
<br>
Now I am not really sure why you included the section about sex.  Aside from an absolute conviction that any religion that prohibits sex among its practicioners will die a very quick cultural death, I don't see it's pertinence.  I find it amusing that god has to give us sex or he can't beat satan, or that his minion does it as an aside and not under directive from god.  It also amuses me that by this verse, Heather needs her husband's permission to have a headache.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
To the last section I will rebut a few points.  One, if god was regualting for his children's health, why would he drop the 'wash your hands before dinner' rule that even I - heretic ifidel that I am - keep in my house for my children?  What is there for you to conclude trhat blended material fabrics will wear out unevenly when it is the mechanichal damage to a fabric not the fiber that wears them out?  Like an alloy they are inherently stronger and better if properly proportioned.  Your argument is on its face false and ungrounded. Finally, I believe it DOES mean that one &quot;who has accepted Christ, His death, His atonement, and His resurrection will not be saved&quot; because of all the hoopy laws.  Only 144,000 will get in, and there are millions and billions who have lived and are yet alive and more still to come.  Not very good odds no matter how you slice it.  <br>
<br>
PS - don't worry about the length, I quite enjoyed it and myself run on and ramble quite often. <p><br>

Good point. Another example is circumcision, a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>commandment</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for jews that Paul readily dismissed because the gentiles resisted converting in the face of painful penile reduction surgery.<br>

Christ tells us that he is not come to destroy the law and the prophets but to fufill them.  In other words He and the Atonement were the culmination of the Mosiac law and the prophesies concerning His coming.  He was the reason they were given and because of His sacrafice for us, they were no longer necessary.<br>
<br>
The higher law, (turning your cheek -forgiveness--instead of eye for an eye.)  Loving your neighbor and God as Brit said pretty much covered the spirit of the laws and the became the new convenant.<br>
<br>
So some would ask why do we even have the OT then.  The reason is that it serves as a testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ.  It contains the prophesies of His coming.   It also contains many wonderful stories of faith that can teach us how to love God and follow Him. And stories of failure that show us how to avoid sin. <br>
<br>
The reason that Peter received the vision is that there was a misunderstanding among members of the church that the Mosiac law should still be practiced.  They didnt get it, so God had to reveal himself to his prophet Peter to keep error from entering into the church.  (Thanks Dave for making my point for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

Builder of universes, writer of laws that operate as forces of nature, master of the universe, all knowing, all powerful, all seeing...and he can only hold one conversation at a time.  Somehow, it is an infringement of 'free will' to reveal himself directly to anyone and clearly indicate what is and should be, yet he is still able to tell one man his will.<br>
<br>
Then again, it could just be one man with a political agenda advancing his personal glory on this earth.  He can't convert you because you don't want to give up your meal plan.  He can't convert you because you don't want to mutilate your genitalia.  He can't convert you because there is so much in conflict between the culture and the theology that it will never fly.  We have already seen the church re-write itself to better assimilate other cultures (hello?  easter?  Dec 25? flood myths?  anyone?) Hence a 'vision' that removes all the road blocks and allows him to discriminatorily preach whatever he can sell and abolish whatever he can't.  Good thing he had that vision 3 times, or we might not have taken him seriously.<br>
<br>
Laws are not given as symbols.  Laws are given to obey.  A wedding ring is given as a symbol.  A parchment degree is given as a symbol.  A traffic signal is given to obey, with direct and measurable consequences if it is not.  To Heather's credit, she is trying very hard to obey as many laws as she can distinguish.  Her personal integrity demands it and she does not hide herself behind flattery and eloquence.  She will flat out declare whom she thinks is going to hell and why. She has some trouble with conflicting laws and apparently avoids the cognitive dissonance by refusing to study that area of law, keeping her eyes closed to it.  Yet others blithely dismiss and walk away from the same area if they but glimpse it.  You have the decalogue reduced to two general platitudes!  Your logic about J-Zeus coming not to destroy the laws but to fulfill them breaks down as soon as YOU ABOLISH THE LAWS! At that point he HAS come to destroy the law! Your &quot;In other words&quot; quip is like saying &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill...in other words killing that guy is okay&quot; and equates directly to self-contradiction and hypocrisy.  God authored the law.  To cite 'higher' law means that there is an authority higher than god.<br>
<br>
If by making your point for you, you are meaning I exposed the hypocrisy of it, you are very welcome.  If by making your point for you, you mean something I said in some way validates your theistic position, I think you need to reread my post.  The bible as work supports only men and their political agendas; or, if you are correct about god, then it supports only satan.  Either way, it is a horrible thing to follow.<br>

<br>
In the sacrificial lamb, it had to be the first born, it had to be without blemish, the blood was shed so that the persons sins could be atoned for.  These are all symbols of Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Circumcision was a symbol of being a separate, unique covenant people. It was also a symbol of humility and submission to God <br>
<br>
Dueteronomy 10:16<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The food laws were symbolic of keeping yourself clean and unspotted from the influence of the gentiles or the eveil in the world. <br>
<br>
All of things pointed to the Atonement.  The fufillment of the laws.  The laws were given to teach and prepare the people for the arrival of the Messiah and the Atonement. In Christs completion of the atonement, no more need to prepare for it.(the laws)<br>
<br>
The Gospel and the sacrafice of God was the new covenant  see Hebrew 8, 9 and 10.  And in completing the final sacrafice did not destroy the law in the sense that the law was without merit, but fufilled or a better word would be completed the law.<br>
<br>
I have been trying to think of an example and the best I can come up with is comparing the Mosaic law to rehearsals for a play. You practice and practice and practice and then comes the real thing. The presentation of the Play.  In performing the play, you dont destroy the rehearsals, you complete or fufill them.  And after the play is performed, there is no reason to continue rehearsing.<br>
<br>
An example of higher law would be while your children are young you have a set bedtime which you enforce.  The principle/value for the bedtime is that the child needs sufficient rest.  As the child grows in their understanding, instead of strictly enforcing a bedtime, you teach them the principle, rest is good for you.  <br>
<br>
The Mosiac law was a very specific law because as is evident in the 40 years in the wilderness, the Isrealites, were &quot;immature&quot; spiritually.  The gospel or new covenant of the NT teaches the principle/values behind the laws.<br>
<br>
On making my point you asked why it was any different for Peter as the head of the church to recieve revelation to guide the church than Joseph Smith to receive revelation.  That is the same question I pose.  <br>
<br>
On God speakng to just one person.  God set forth his pattern in Amos 3:7  If he is going to do anything, he will tell his servants the prophets.  Its like a power of attorney, why would you give power of attorney to a bunch of different people? You wouldnt, you would pick one person and give them very clear instructions on how you want things done.  That doesnt mean God cant or doesnt talk to individuals about their own personal concerns.  He answers my prayers and talks to me in my heart and mind about things that concern me.  <br>
<br>
But for things that concern the world, he has one spokesperson.  <br>

<br>
Which is more likely, that god speaks to one man at a time every few hundred years and doesn't corroberate his story, or that one man every couple centuries gets away with claiming it?  How about the representatives of god on earth?  The pope, the council of 12, the living prophet, etc, etc...<br>
