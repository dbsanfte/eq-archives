Eevee chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to be going to bed or something... i need to rest up for the journey. I'm looking for Marth.&quot; Eevee stretched and flew out of the room, running into Galith on the way out.<br>

&quot;Oh hi Galith! I was just going to bed.&quot; Eevee waved at the silverish blue haired elf.<br>

&quot;Hello Eevee. Have a peaceful rest.&quot; He smiled back.<br>

Eevee flew down the hallways... very sleepily.<br>
Finally she reached a small garden and perched herself on a tree branch and fell fast alseep.<br>

Really, the title is only a name.  I have not even had my Fever yet.  But still...&quot; she sighed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I see many dangers ahead, for all who are involved with the prophetess Kirin.  Or a Stargazer, as we elves call it.  Whichever road you choose, the darkness will always find you.  Enari is a very dangerous man, and so is Phoenix.  Both are after her and have shed blood before.  But it only makes your mission more necessary.  For Iuil has chosen you, above all others.  It is you who must protect the Stargazer, for it is your god's will.  And, Galith, if a divine being as Iuil may trust you, so may anyone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your path has been set.  Your name has been entered in the Book of Life.  But what paths will spark from yours? Which ones will lead you to the light? Which ones will lead you away?  Will you remembered forever, or will your name be erased?&quot;  She smiled again, misty and happily sad.  &quot;That decision is your own.  Not even Iuil can change it.  The Quill is in your own hands now.  The Ink is fresh.  Now write your own ending.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then, she laughed a bit, shaking her head.  &quot;I am sorry.  I make no sense.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 290<br> <font color=#FF9300>(3/20/03 7:41:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm158.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> lol...i understood her... for the most part</span><hr size=1> &quot;Oh no, that's quite alright.

<br>
Galith understood most of what she had said but not all. He wasn't aquainted with the styles of these elves yet, as he had only been here a couple weeks. Before that he had traveled the world, learning of new peoples and placed. When he was younger, he had left his home for travels and knowledge.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've already made up my mind what i will do. Thankyou for your words of wisdom.&quot; Galith nodded in reverence, closing his eyes.<br>

&quot;Are you all right?&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Goodnight Ms. Ayaka.&quot; She smiled at Ayaka and covered herself.<br>
&quot;Thankyou.&quot; She trailed off as she fell asleep.<br>
<br>
__*_*__<br>
<br>
Galith walked to his room and quickly dressed for bed, then retired for the night.<br>
<br>
__*_*__<br>
<br>
Kirin woke up with a start... she felt her face and noticed she had been crying in her sleep.<br>
She looked around quickly and worriedly... she knew she had also at least screamed once.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that... dream. It was...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> her thoughts trailed as she noticed a small faint light coming from the garden outside the window.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need some fresh air.&quot; She whispered to herself as she pulled the covers off and quietly rested her feet on the floor.<br>
<br>
As she walked towards the door, she made sure not to wake anyone and then opened the door slowly and walked down the halls. After a moment she came upon an open doorway that led to the garden she had seen before. Her eyes ran over then lovely scene quickly and saw the faint glow... she looked closer and saw it was Eevee sleeping on a tree branch.<br>
Kirin smiled and then walked into the garden on the small pathway through the vegeation.<br>
A sigh escpaped as she sat down by a fountain... taking in the soothing sound. <br>
<br>
Her thoughts wandered back to the dream... or nightmare. It was worse than any she had before... but still it didn't make any sense. None of her dreams did, but some often came back to haunt her in real life... reminding her of something that had really happened or something she had felt. Mostly it was something to come or feel... maybe that was what everyone was talking about. Her &quot;prophecy&quot; powers.<br>
She rested her elbows on her knees... then in turn her face in her hands. <br>
<br>
The events from the day ran through her mind... as well as the events from the past week. It seemed as though she was meant to be in this other part of the world, the part forgotten and less traveled. It was all thanks to Enari...<br>
Why did she keep thinking about him like she did? She couldn't seem to shake him from her mind at all. For some reasons she felt sorry for the man, but something else was there as well. Something she couldn't understand. <br>
<br>
She looked up to see the place where Eris and Seifer had been earlier... and couldn't help but smile at the thought of the two.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I'm glad this happened... otherwise i wouldn't have good friends</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Kirin hadn't had any good friends before... none that had really cared for her. Eris and Seifer were quite a couple...She smiled again and then shook her head. Those two were so in love... <br>
Her heart ached for both of them. Seifer becuase Eris wouldn't accept his love and Eris becuase she didn't want to loose a friendship.<br>
She put her face back in her hands as a tear formed and dropped, glimmering in the little light there was.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I wish i had someone like that... who cared for me that way. But i doubt anyone, especially Enari wouldn't ever... Why do I keep coming back to him?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kirin started silently crying.<br>
<br>
Little did she know that Eevee was awake and was watching her from her &quot;perch.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

The only sound he could hear was the peaceful sound of the Balder's breath.  He sighed, and rolled over to his side.<br>
<br>
Damn.  He knew he shouldn't have done what he did.  He should have known that Eris would freak out.<br>
<br>
But those moments when she hadn't...how sweet those moments were.  He'd go up against a million demisorceresses to have those moments back again.  He had felt the eagerness in Eris...had she wanted it to happen as much as he? Or had she just been swept up in the moment?<br>
<br>
He hoped she would forgive him.  <br>
<br>
Listening to soft breathing, he fell asleep.<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Ayaka knelt before the altar, praying.  How long the day had been.  And how late it was to be praying.  But she couldn't sleep.  <br>
<br>
She prayed for peace between Eris and Seifer, and for peace within Kirin's tormented soul.  Ayaka saw her mind, and how she battled bravely with her spirit.  She prayed Isis would spare her but a few hour's peace.  She prayed for Balder and for Eevee, and everyone she had met this day.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>AYAKA, DAUGHTER OF MALAKAI.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Ayaka gasped when she heard the voice.  She was suddenly plunged into darkness, and she saw a horrible sight...a raven, black as black, emerging from sinful flame.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>YOU CANNOT HIDE HER FROM ME, SOULCASTER.  SHE WILL COME TO ME WILLINGLY.  STEP ASIDE.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Ayaka trembled and muttered a prayer to Isis.  Almost immedaitely the presence vanished, and she returned to her place in the temple.<br>

She lifted her face from her hands as she wiped the tears from her eyes and leaned against the tree.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry...&quot; she murmered, talking to Iuil.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know I mustn't be this selfish.&quot; Her voice trailed off as she remembered waking up from a dream, in Enari's arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;But i can dream can't I? Maybe if I accept this feeling it'll fade away?&quot; Her whispers so quiet only an elf with amazing hearing could make out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aw... she's in love... with some stupid bastard i presume. Grr... i hate romantic feelings... and guys. Oh well. Can't live with 'em can't live without 'em...&quot; Eevee sighed as she remembered a past love she'd had.<br>
<br>
Kirin took a moment, remembering how she felt that moment... and wished with her whole heart she could  have that moment back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why...&quot; Kirin  started, but couldn't  finish as she put her face back in her hands.<br>
<br>
She didn't even know him. How could she feel like that? Only an hour or so was spent, in her whole life, with Enari. And not really with him. She followed him to a forest... he transported her for evil reasons... so what? That wasn't anything special, or so she thought to herself. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

<br>
&quot;Kirin?&quot; she yawned, getting out of bed.  &quot;What's wrong?  Somethin' botherin' ya?  I'm all ears,&quot; she offered.<br>

<br>
Ayaka ran through the quiet halls of the temple, tripping on her obes, stumbling, then runnign again around the corner.  &quot;I have...to warn them!&quot; she panted.<br>
<br>
****<br>
<br>
Ah, what was he kidding? He couldn't sleep...Seifer sighed and sat up, looking into the dark shadows of the room.  His fingers suddenly went up to his shoulder and he winced.  His fingers rubbed a long, irregular looking scar, which made the healing skin look almost pale blue.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Oh no...&quot; She muttered, wiping the tears from her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I just had a nightmare. How much did you happen to hear?&quot; <br>
<br>
Eevee sighed and laid back down. It looked like Eris would handle this one. She had no advise to give to Kirin. Hopefully Kirin would fess up and admit her feelings.<br>

<br>
Suddenly Eris flinched.  &quot;Ah!&quot; she gasped, her hand going for her neck as if to slap a pesky insect.  But no such plague was in this temple.<br>
<br>
She winced.  &quot;I-I'm okay,&quot; she said, rubbing a spot on her neck.  It was visible to Kirin now, as if it had just appeared, but in truth it was always there.  It was a black star marked on her neck, very small, and five black diamond shapes surrounding it.  It looked like a tattoo.  She rubbed it gingerly for a few moments, and sighed.  &quot;It was nothing.  So, what's the problem?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 393<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/11/03 3:34:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm158.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> eep... a mark?

Or is that any of my buissiness.&quot;  She quickly changed the subject.<br>
<br>
Eevee furrowed her eyebrows in annoyance. Why was Kirin so afraid of admitting her feelings? Who was it she was in love with? Eevee sighed and stood up on her perch, getting a better view. Quickly she flew to Kirin's shoulder and sat on it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Young lady... you're in love. I KNOW it. So stop it with the self denial!!!&quot; For such a little creature Eevee made a loud noise. <br>

But anyone could tell the mark was still doing something to cause her pain.  &quot;So...what's this Eevee's talkin' about? Love???&quot; Her eyebrows rose in interest.  &quot;Who's the lucky guy? Galith? Galith's a catch!&quot; she laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Or maybe, is it that guy that we saw you with in the forest?&quot; she guessed.  &quot;C'mon, the faeries are never wrong.  Spill it girl!&quot;<br>
<br>
She was laughing, but suddenly she writhed again in pain, dropping to her knees this time.  She clutched at her neck, tears brimming at her eyes.  &quot;Ah,&quot; she gasped, fighting against it.  &quot;Ah, jeez...I'm...alright...&quot;<br>

<br>
Ayaka felt the dakrness coming, and ran faster towards the bedrooms, panting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris! ERIS!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Over the temple, a shadow was cast.  Not the shadow of a raven, but of a dragon, with broad wings, and a long tail that trailed in its stead.  It glimmered silver in the triple moonlight, and the hitn of dawn.<br>
<br>
And on the dragon's back, sat a silver haired man, who looked upon the temple in hunger. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 401<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/12/03 11:10:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm158.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm...maybe...*hides her hands behind her back*</span><hr size=1> she blushed slightly when &quot;the guy in the forest.&quot; <br>

She tried to say she was fine, but her neck was on fire!!! What was going on???<br>
<br>
Suddenly she coudln't breathe. A darkness washed over her and made her gasp for air.  &quot;SEIFER!!!&quot; she cried, her voice desperate.  Was she callign for him to run, or come to her aid? She didn't know...<br>
<br>
But almost immediately, Seifer was there.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
&quot;SEIFER!!!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Eris! Seifer immediately jumped out of bed, driven by the sound of pain and fear in the woman's voice.  He burst through the door (knocking it down again) and rushing to her side carefully grasped her in his arms, looking into her eyes.  The bright ememrald orbs were glazing over as she struggled to breathe, clutching at the side of her neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris!&quot; He tried to pry the hand from her neck, and finally succeeded in doing so.  He saw he mark on her neck, burning black, and stared in confusion.  &quot;What is this???&quot; he pleaded desperately as she began to writhe in his arms.  &quot;Eris! Oh gods, what's going on???&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly Ayaka burst in, flush with fear.  &quot;The temple is under attack! A silver dragon, and Kuja!  He's come for Eris!&quot;<br>
<br>
Seifer held Eris' convulsing body close, looking helpless.  &quot;What the hell is going on?!?!&quot; he cried.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 403<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/12/03 11:38:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm158.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Under Attack!!!</span><hr size=1> &quot;A dragon?!

Seifer did not need to be told twice.  Holding Eris's writhing body tightly, he bolted out the door, yelling for Kirin and Eevee to follow.<br>
<br>
Eris' eyes were going dull...&quot;Seifer...&quot; she choked painfully, feeling a dark presence swarm over her, draining her soul.<br>

The silver dragon roared and dove upon the temple.  But then, Ayaka came running out, pointing her rod at them.<br>

&quot;Don't even try, cleric!&quot; he laughed.  &quot;Silva, attack!&quot;<br>
