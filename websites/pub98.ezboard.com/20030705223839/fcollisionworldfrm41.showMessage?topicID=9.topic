She came to the El Acapuloco. She walked inside ad told the waitress she had a party of 2. &quot;What do you think?&quot; Derla asked Crow as she motioned around at the colorful walls and everything. &quot;I like foreign food. Chinese and Mexican especially. I hope you'll like it... I just thought of a place that would have some people and color.&quot; She realised she'd been selfish in picking out the place.

<br>
Crow was a bit thrown off by the insanely bright decor, but grew used to it in a matter of seconds as they sat down.  The place was actually quite interesting, but the gigantic pinata hanging above their table was beginning to scare him.  He didn't mention this to Derla, who seemed a little embrarassed about soemthing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chinese and Mexican, eh?&quot; Crow nodded, picking at the table top and having his attention swayed for a moment by the sparkly salt-and-pepper shakers.  &quot;Interesting tastes... Can't say what I myself prefer, though...  I'll eat pretty much anything.  You probably noticed that already, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
He slipped a few of the coffee sugar packets into his pocket as he watched Derla watching the fountain.<br>

<br>
Crow leaned back and put one hand behind the head, the other supporting the menu before him.  There was a guy with a really strange and colorful hat standing at their table; supposedly the waiter.  Crow looked down.<br>
<br>
&quot;...Uh... I'll have two of whatever she's having... and this weird spicy mixture of something or another whose name I can't pronnounce.  And a bowl of chili.  And...&quot;<br>
<br>
The waiter waited for two minutes until Crow was done.  Then he took both their menus, opened up the pinata above their heads, and stuck them inside.  He left.<br>
<br>
Crow turned back to Derla.  &quot;Hey, it's all over now.  So just try and enjoy yourself for a little while; I'm sure it's been a while since you just let loose and forgot all your problems, huh?&quot;  He smiled at her with only the 3i open, which most people found rather creepy.  &quot;Come on.  He's probably a billion light years away by now.  How's he going to get at us any time soon?&quot;<br>

Grinning broadly at the sight of Derla smiling, Crow stopped fooling around the salt shaker and wondered about where exactly he WAS sleeping.  &quot;Oi... I haven't thought about that one.  Silly me.&quot;  He tapped lightly on the back of Derla's hand, which was resting on the tabletop, and laughed.  <br>
&quot;Obviously, I'll have to stay with you.  Is that too much of a problem?  I can always sleep outside, but you're NEVER going to get rid of me.&quot;<br>

You can stay with me there if you'd like. I'm not going to object.&quot; 'Not since you saved me...' she silently added. &quot;I would be honored to have you! I don't get visitors, though, so you'll have to excuse any and all mess.&quot; She grinned. One of them would be taking the couch tonight, but she wouldn't tell Crow. She'd take the couch tonight and let him have the bed. &quot;If the food tastes half as good as it smells, we're in for a treat!&quot; She closed her eyes for a moment and breathed in the smell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 362<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/11/03 5:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm41.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Everyone Is HAPPY!!</span><hr size=1> <br>
Crow watched Derla, delighted that she seemed so happy for once.  &quot;Oh, that's no problem.  I'm used to messes. I'm a bit of a slob myself... but not when it comes to other people's houses,&quot; he added hastily, not wanting Derla to have any reservations whatsoever about inviting him into her house.<br>
<br>
&quot;And speaking of food...&quot;  The waiter with his overlarge hat came over to their table, his tray laden with several plates stacked with the food of their request.  Crow, as usual, couldn't remember ordering any of it.  He told Derla this, thinking maybe she'd be amused by the fact that he could remember battle strategies and physical descriptions as easy as he heard them, but could never recall what he'd last ordered at a resturaunt.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I guess it doesn't really matter.  I'd eat it either way,&quot; Crow mumbled around a mouthful of beans.  Chili was too messy to put in his pocket, so he was resolving to just eat it all in one sitting.<br>
