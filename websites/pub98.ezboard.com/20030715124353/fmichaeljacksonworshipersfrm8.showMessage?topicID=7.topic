<br>
<br>
<br>
Day 51,<br>
I was feeling very sick, i had a fever and so i had to stay in bed. <br>
I also played some video games again all day to help me forget about me being sick and everything that was bugging me. Emily came to my house so we played together.<br>
&quot;i'm sorry your sick&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah, me to&quot;<br>
&quot;so um, did you talk to Destiny or the others yet?&quot;<br>
&quot;nope, just you so you ready to play some video games?&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah sure, but i will beat you though like always&quot;<br>
&quot;haha, you wish&quot;<br>
We then went up to my room and played video games. <br>
&quot;hey Emil do you want to stay the night?&quot;<br>
&quot;sure&quot;<br>
&quot;ok or we could have a sleep over so everyones here&quot;<br>
&quot;ok, it should be fun&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah make overs to&quot;<br>
&quot;we better ask your mom first&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah we shoud, lets go ask her now&quot;<br>
&quot;ok&quot;<br>
We then went to go ask my mom and she said yes so we called up everyone and they said yes. I know i was sick but i would just have to be careful around everyone. My friends also said they were going to make sure i feel better. As soon as everyone came over we took turns on the<br>
game.<br>
&quot;hey you cheater!&quot; i told Destiny<br>
&quot;i am not, you are&quot; Destiny said.<br>
&quot;you guys fight to much, you both cheated&quot; Kirsten said.<br>
&quot;oh god, you guys&quot;Emily said. <br>
We all laughed and we were having a good time til some one mentioned<br>
the named *Michael*. <br>
&quot;have you talked to Michael yet?&quot; Emily asked.<br>
&quot;no, and i wished if you would stop reminding me of him&quot;<br>
&quot;why? i thought you liked him though&quot;<br>
&quot;i do but i am trying to forget him for a while sheesh!!!&quot;<br>
I then got up and left the room and went to the living room and sat on the couch crying. I have been trying not to mention him, it has been weeks, but to me it feels like months. I then heard the phone rind so i went to go answer it........<br>
&quot;hello?&quot; i said crying.<br>
&quot;this is Michael is......&quot; i then interupted him..<br>
&quot;yes i am right here&quot;<br>
&quot;baby whats wrong?&quot;<br>
&quot;nothing&quot;<br>
&quot;well i got good news&quot;<br>
&quot;whats the good news?&quot; i said still crying.<br>
All the girls came from my room to where i was listning to me.<br>
&quot;i'm in town right now, i am comming to see you&quot;<br>
&quot;your lieing&quot;<br>
&quot;no i'm not, i'm on my way. I should be there in 2 minutes&quot;<br>
&quot;really?&quot; i said wiping away my tears.<br>
&quot;yes, go wait out side&quot;<br>
&quot;can my friends come out there with me?&quot;<br>
&quot;of course, i'll meet you outside&quot;<br>
&quot;ok&quot;<br>
&quot;love you&quot;<br>
&quot;love you more&quot;<br>
Then we hung up and i went outside to wait for him with all my friends.<br>
I then saw his Limo pull up, Michael and his guards got out then they let<br>
the Limo driver go have a break. I thought it was funny, my friends were<br>
shocked when they saw Michael come up to me.<br>
&quot;hey baby i missed you&quot; he said giving me a hug.<br>
&quot;i missed you to Michael&quot;<br>
&quot;how come you were crying over the phone?&quot;<br>
&quot;because i have missed you alot&quot;.<br>
&quot;i missed you so very much i even got you a present&quot;<br>
&quot;you did?&quot;<br>
&quot;yes i did&quot;<br>
&quot;ok well come on in&quot; i said letting him in to my house.<br>
Michael pulled out a present from his pocket and handed it to me, <br>
i took it and then opened it. When i got it open, it was so bueatiful.<br>
&quot;Aww, Michael you shouldn't have......&quot; <br>
&quot;you deserve it, i love you&quot;<br>
Everyone was getting envy of me, the gift Michael gave me was a very<br>
expensive braclet and neckless (picture anything).<br>
All my friends started asking for autographs from him and he said sure.<br>
&quot;thank you Michael, i wish i had something for you&quot; i told him.<br>
&quot;don't worrie about it, as long as i have you i need nothing more&quot;<br>
&quot;no, you need somethng eles, i feel so bad&quot;<br>
&quot;don't be&quot; he said with a smile.<br>
All day we hung with Michael and we played even more video games.<br>
Michael was having a good time, he looked like he was a kid inside an<br>
adult body. I sat on his lap on my bed while everyone eles was sitting on the floor. <br>
&quot;let me try to go against Michael please?&quot; i asked.<br>
&quot;sure, go ahead&quot; they all said and agreed.<br>
Everyone wanted to see Michael and i go against each other on the game, the game we were playing was Mario Go Cart Racing.<br>
&quot;ok, i'll try&quot; Michael said.<br>
Michael and i were then playing the game, i chose the princess and he chose Mario, then i chose Yoshie instead of princess.<br>
&quot;you should stay the princess&quot; Michael said. <br>
&quot;why?&quot; i said laughing.<br>
&quot;because you are a princess&quot;<br>
&quot;i don't care, i like Yoshie&quot;<br>
We then just played, during the race he was ahead then i started to be ahead of him.<br>
&quot;if i win you do what i want&quot; he told me.<br>
&quot;fine but if i win then you do what i want&quot;. i told him back.<br>
&quot;looks like i am going to win&quot; Michael said.<br>
&quot;every one always wins me, so what do i have to do then?&quot;<br>
&quot;wait til later and i will let you know&quot;<br>
&quot;ok, so are you staying in a hotel right now?&quot;<br>
&quot;no but later i am going to check in to one&quot;<br>
&quot;you can stay here for a while if you want, i'm sure my mom will let you&quot;<br>
&quot;.................&quot; was all he said (nothing really lol).<br>
&quot;please Michael? i have to cook tonight anyways&quot;<br>
&quot;you sure about this?&quot;<br>
&quot;yes, very, we all could keep you company and you can have fun.....&quot;<br>
&quot;only if your mom says its ok.&quot;<br>
My mom then called and she asked if we were ok and i told her we were then i asked her and she said sure but he had to sleep on the couch and stuff. Then we hung up. So i ran back to my room to tell them.<br>
&quot;Michael you can stay&quot;<br>
&quot;ok&quot;<br>
I was so happy, i don't know if Michael was because he had half a smile<br>
on his face.<br>
&quot;Michael? whats wrong?&quot;<br>
&quot;nothing&quot;<br>
&quot;you don't really want to stay do you? you don't have to........&quot;<br>
&quot;i know, i'll stay&quot;.<br>
Michael then pulled me back on to the bed and held me in his arms. <br>
We decided not to play no more so we let everyone eles play.<br>
&quot;by the way you have to sleep on the couch&quot;<br>
&quot;thats fine.........i can't wait to try your cooking either&quot;<br>
&quot;i should have my mom cook insead of me then&quot;<br>
&quot;i'm sure your a great cook&quot;.<br>
I got up from the bed and had the game turned off, then i played my music, i put in my Eminem CD and put it on Superman. All of us girls got<br>
up and stared dancing while Mchael sat there and watched. He even <br>
laughed to. Michael even got up then he walked up to me and we started dancing together. We were all having a blast, we just kept daning for a couple hours or more. <br>
&quot;ok you guys dance, i better go get dinner started&quot; i told them all.<br>
I then walked out of the room and went to the kitchen, Michael followed.<br>
&quot;did you come to watch me cook?&quot;<br>
&quot;thats one reason&quot;<br>
&quot;whats the other?&quot;<br>
&quot;because i wanted to stay by you&quot;<br>
&quot;hehe, i think your just shy around them&quot;<br>
I then got dinner started, i was cooking spagettie. Then we went back up to my room, everyone got there beds ready, then we went to the table to eat. My mom walked in the door with some soda,<br>
&quot;Wow you have alot of friends over!&quot;<br>
&quot;i know i do, i even got dinner ready and everything&quot;<br>
&quot;i can see that, you did a nice job, usually your lazy&quot;<br>
&quot;i know&quot;<br>
&quot;i can see why you did all this work&quot;<br>
&quot;why did i do it then?&quot; i said laughing.<br>
&quot;because Michaels here&quot;<br>
I started to blush very hard so i hid my face in Michaels lap.<br>
&quot;mom? did you have to say THAT in front of everyone?&quot;<br>
&quot;you asked so i told&quot;<br>
&quot;well if it was that you could have kept it on the down side&quot;<br>
&quot;sorry&quot;.<br>
I just kept my head on Michaels lap, i was so emberessed that i didn't want Michael to see my face. <br>
&quot;anyways lets just eat&quot; i said.<br>
&quot;thats a good idea&quot; Michael said.<br>
&quot;Yeah it is a good idea, i'm hungry and i have been working all day&quot;.<br>
My mom said.<br>
We then started eating, my head was now up were its supose to be.<br>
&quot;thanks for letting your daughter visit me for a week&quot; Michael said.<br>
&quot;yourwelcome Michael, i just got one wonder though&quot;<br>
&quot;whats that?&quot;<br>
&quot;well i don't know if you know or not, but there has been rumours you <br>
rapped my daughter&quot;<br>
&quot;i would never do that&quot;<br>
&quot;i know, then there is what my daughter said.....&quot;<br>
&quot;what did she say?&quot;<br>
All of us then took our food to the living room leaving Michael and my mom alone, this was before they started talking though.<br>
&quot;she said that you two you know, and that you gave her a choice?&quot;<br>
&quot;thats true, i didn't want to make her do anything&quot;<br>
&quot;ok, i'm not mad then because she is grown enough to do that, just as long as she was not rapped, that would be to far. I apreaciate you telling me&quot;<br>
&quot;no problem&quot;.<br>
Michael felt a bit unconfertable but at least my mom knows now and <br>
Michael and i can continue to see each other.<br>
Us girls was then done eating and so we took our dishes to the sink.<br>
&quot;Michael you done?&quot; i asked him.<br>
&quot;yes i am&quot;<br>
&quot;ok&quot;<br>
I then grabbed his dishes and he stopped me,<br>
&quot;i can get that&quot;<br>
&quot;no its ok your a guest&quot;<br>
He then just let me take it. Then i got his stuff ready and put it by the couch, we all got settled in to a movie. I of course sat by Michael like I<br>
always do, we all just squized in on to the couch together. My mom did to. As we watched the movie i saw Destiny slip her hand by his you know what, i then took my hand and pushed her hand away, Michael was<br>
watching us fight the whole time. Destiny kept trying to put her hand down there, Michael decided to do something about it.<br>
He took his hand, grabbed both of our hands and pulled them away.<br>
Then Michael grabbed my hand and held it. Destinys hand to but he kissed me so there was no worrie there. After the movie, i told everyone to get there stuff and bring it in to the living room while i fixed Michaels<br>
bed which was of course on the couch. We all slept on the floor, we all<br>
stayed up all night but Michael and I. Well i just kept my eyes shut and<br>
pretended i was asleep. Destiny went and gave Michael a kiss on the cheak, i got so mad. Later we all fell alseep but first it was Michael then <br>
Me, now the rest of them went to sleep like maybe two hours later.  <br>
<br>
