<br>
Moaning, groaning, whining. A pack of cards floated above the table and fell down. Every single card fluttered to the floor, except the<br>
king of spades, which fell down open on the table.<br>
&quot;You are cheating, Peter&quot;, said a low and eerie voice. The candles on the table flickered for a moment, then burned steady again.<br>
&quot;No, John, I'm not&quot;, Peter replied, &quot;I'm just, uh, talented.&quot; Peter looked like a man who had been severely burned. He had red and black<br>
burns all over his hand, face, and clothing. However, there was something unreal about him: it was just as if he was here, and not<br>
here, and all at the same time. Now and then a blue, red and yellow flame flared up from his arms or his face for a moment, and<br>
extinguished again. Looking at the other attendants, you could notice the same unrealness.<br>
&quot;Ha, talented for cheating you mean&quot;, John said. John was a big and impressive guy. His green eyes reflected the candlelight. He<br>
seemed to have a third eye, in the middle of his forehead, but on closer investigation it appeared to be only a perfectly round hole,<br>
through which you could see the gray stone wall behind him.<br>
&quot;The task of every man is to find his talent&quot;, old George declared with raised finger. George looked old, his face was wrinkled, and he<br>
had a little white hair on his head. Old George was very thin, you could see right through him, at the places without bones, or veins or<br>
other things that shouldn't be visible.<br>
&quot;Well, that seems to be the problem&quot;, John said with a smile. &quot;our Peter isn't a man&quot;. All three of them laughed.<br>
<br>
The fourth at the table was silent. This was Martin, John's son. Just as John, he also was equipped with extra holes, but all over his<br>
body. From time to time some blood dripped out of them, unstoppable and unnoticed. When the others laughed, he couldn't help<br>
smiling. But at the same time he thought: &quot;What am I doing here?&quot;. He didn't want to be here. He didn't even want to be, not in his<br>
current shape. John had been right, Peter wasn't a man, nor were any of them. They were ghosts, shadows of the men they once<br>
were. That was a long time ago, however, before the war. Since then they were sitting here, in their old houses. John and Martin had<br>
lived here, Peter had been a neighbour. And old George, was, well, just old George. The others didn't know why he was here.<br>
<br>
Once they had been happy, living in the small village. Well, village was a big name for the three farms it consisted of. They had had a<br>
few cows, and a piece of farmland for their crop. The cows you can still see when you travel along the road through the village at<br>
night. They are standing on the fields near the dilapidated farms, staring at the road. When you pass, they will look at you with their<br>
big, sad eyes, begging you to stop. <br>
<br>
Then the war came. Soldiers came along over the road: fresh soldiers, marching and singing, went into one direction, wounded or<br>
dead soldiers were transported in the other direction. The first day John and Peter, their wives Lisa and Margaret, Martin and Gerard<br>
from the third farm went out and had been looking at them. The soldiers went by for weeks on end, and they took up their farm work<br>
again. One night, there was shooting in the distance. It got closer and closer, and John decided they should hide in the cellars. The<br>
shooting continued another two days and nights, and all that time they stayed in the cellar. Those days, they lived from cold potatoes,<br>
and from water from the old well, after Martin had pumped out the mud. Occasionally they heard the sound of breaking glass, and<br>
once a loud boom' from the direction of Peter's farm.<br>
<br>
John threw a card on the table. He let it spin around a few times, before it fell down.<br>
&quot;Ten of hearts&quot;, he shouted excited. He looked challenging around the table.<br>
&quot;Seven of hearts&quot;, Martin grumbled. Peter had nine of hearts.<br>
&quot;Queen of spades&quot;, said old George, and through his eyes, the wall behind him looked triumphant. <br>
<br>
Finally, the fighting had stopped. A last shot, and there was silence again. They looked at each other, carefully opened the cellar door,<br>
and glanced in the light. Their house had been pretty damaged: parts of the roof were missing, and there was a big hole in the kitchen<br>
wall. Most windows were broken. Then they saw what the big bang had caused: a grenade had exploded on Peter's yard, and had left<br>
a large crater. They started to repair their farms. First John's, then Peter's and finally Gerard's. From the roofs that had to be repaired<br>
they looked down on the road. Soldiers were passing again. This one had other uniforms, and talked another language, and went in the<br>
other direction. The direction where once the wounded had been carried, now fresh soldiers marched, and the other way around. Not<br>
that the farmers cared who ruled the country: if they paid tax for the one or for the other, it didn't make any difference. Now other<br>
things came with the soldiers: helicopters, which had been flying so low that they were nearly blown of Peter's roof while they placed<br>
the last slates, and which startled the cows. Then the tanks came. Not over the road, no, straight through their fields. They destroyed<br>
the crop, killed some animals, and they even seemed to enjoy that. And that, that made a difference. <br>
<br>
Peter had been the first. One day brought some mysterious package back from town.<br>
&quot;What's that?&quot;, his wife Margaret had asked.<br>
&quot;Shht&quot;, he had said. With the package, they went to the cellar, and there he showed it: a large rifle. Carefully he unwrapped it and<br>
checked the mechanisms of shiny steel.<br>
&quot;But...that...that's dangerous!&quot;, she had said.<br>
&quot;Yes, but they are dangerous too. They killed my animals, so I kill them.&quot;<br>
&quot;How...how did you get that?&quot;<br>
&quot;Shht, honey, you really don't want to know&quot;, Peter said, and kissed her tenderly.<br>
<br>
Peter heard the chatting in the next room.<br>
&quot;Are they still talking?&quot;, he asked, while dealing for a new game.<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;, John answered, &quot;but don't ask me what they are discussing&quot;.<br>
&quot;The same as ever&quot;, Martin thought, &quot;all those years talking the same&quot;, but he said nothing.<br>
<br>
John and Martin had been next. They had been able to buy a gun and joined Peter, just as John's wife Lisa. &quot;Why should only men do<br>
exciting things?&quot;, she had said. Things like this couldn't be kept secret in a small community as theirs, so even Gerard from the third<br>
farm got involved. At first all went well. They went out to kill people, to rob banks, to blow up archives. Visitors started to come to<br>
the hamlet: shy persons, with secret packages on secret missions. Things where hidden: behind the loose stone in the cellar, or buried<br>
in the field. &quot;Remember: the package is lying between the large oak and the elder tree west of your farm&quot;.<br>
<br>
The women were chatting, the man played cards, as every day, until the stars began to fade. The same actions, the same discussions,<br>
the same words, day after day.<br>
&quot;If I wouldn't be dead already, I would commit suicide&quot;, Martin thought bitterly. Even his thoughts were the same. The only fun they<br>
had was when a visitor came through the village at night. They always saw the cows who looked white and nearly transparent in the<br>
head lights first. Always. There were two types of visitors. The first type was the frightened type. They saw the cows, put the pedal<br>
to the metal and raced out of the village. This type wasn't very amusing. Sometimes the players didn't even notice. The second type<br>
were the curious. They parked their car on the verge of the road, left their headlights on and stepped out. They heard the cows moo,<br>
sad or in agony. Then they saw the light of the candles, shining out of the broken windows, and slowly tiptoed towards the farm.<br>
When they peered inside, their faces became pale and walked backwards to their car. Once a guy fell over a clump of grass. He had<br>
screamed, and had crawled backwards to his car. The funniest thing had happened only a month ago. Peter had noticed a couple<br>
staring unusual long through the window. Then Peter, with all his burns and blackened clothing, had risen and slowly turned to the<br>
window. They had never seen people running so fast to their car.<br>
<br>
Now the morning announced itself. This was the time when it had happened, long ago. They had just got a secret freight, explosives to<br>
blow up a railroad the next evening. John and Martin killed the time by playing cards. Lisa was sleeping in the other room. Then they<br>
heard the roaring of engines coming closer. John had jumped up and peered through the window. They wanted to run away, but it<br>
was too late already. Trucks with soldiers had stopped on the road. The soldiers jumped of the cars and surrounded the house. Then<br>
they heard the stamping of boots on the yards. They forced the door, captured the inhabitants and began searching. They searched the<br>
place thoroughly: on every square inch of wall they knocked, demolished most furniture and made a big mess, until they finally found<br>
what they were looking for, evidence, behind the loose stones in the cellar. At John's they shot at everything that moved, starting with<br>
John and his family, and ending with the rats on the attic. Peter's farm they just burned, with Peter and Margaret in it. And the third<br>
farm? It remained untouched. Gerard hadn't been there, and there had been no evidence in his farm. But how had the soldiers known<br>
that? That evening they woke up again, all of them. At first they didn't understand.<br>
&quot;Aren't we supposed to be dead?&quot;, Lisa had said. &quot;Look at all those holes in our bodies&quot;. It didn't take them much long to understand<br>
what they were now. Gerard hadn't dared to come back.<br>
<br>
Peter stood up and Margaret entered the room. She was just as burned as he was.<br>
&quot;It was a nice evening.&quot;, she had said, &quot;but now we must go&quot;.<br>
&quot;Yes we have to go now&quot;, said old George. He always said that at this moment. Old George had come later. Why was he here?<br>
Nobody knew. Who was he? Only John seemed to know.<br>
&quot;Welcome back to the family&quot;, John had simply said on his arrival. And that was all.<br>
&quot;Tomorrow evening at my house?&quot;, Peter proposed. Yes, and then at John's again, and then at Peter's and...<br>
