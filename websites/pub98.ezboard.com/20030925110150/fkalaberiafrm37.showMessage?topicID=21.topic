I have been alive now for one hundred years though my appearances place me about eighteen by human standards. I weight one hundred and fifteen pounds, my height is five foot seven inches. I have brown eyes, and long dark hair (see pic &lt;-----) and my skin tone is dark as well. <br>
<br>
My nationality is Spanish and European, my mother being the Spanish one. My maiden tongue however is English for I never met my mother though I know all about her. My occupation is whats known as a Watcher which I will get into shortly. <br>
<br>
I became a dhampire through an odd situation where my mother, a Watcher such as myself, was sired by her vampire while I was in her womb. When I was born, I was taken from her and my father who I have never met either. And as far as they know however, I do not exist, I may be dead and that is how things will remain. <br>
<br>
I have a few noted skills that just come natural to me and that is speed and strength. I am stronger, and faster then mortals. I can lift upwards to five hundred pounds, I can leap upwards by about eight feet. I can run for short distances at such speeds that I become a blur. All of this is a simple part of my make up and does not drain me any faster of energy as it would a human that ran or jumped at their normal speeds and distances. I am in perfect physical condition, I train daily with work out machines like the BowFlex and a punching bag. I am highly skilled in martial arts and small weapons. <br>
<br>
For added personal protection I carry a Magnum when I feel the situation calls for it. <br>
<br>
I can read minds though I am not as good at it as the full vampires. I can not dive into blocked minds but I can sense mind blocks. When in crowds of people, I can pick out who the vampires are and who the mortals are. Also I can sense who is a ghoul to what vampire if the bond between master and slave is strong. <br>
<br>
I can also heal small amounts of physical damage like cuts, bruises and even a gun shot wound in a short period of time. <br>
<br>
Now I suppose you'll want to know my weaknesses. Well alright. I have no weaknesses against holy artifacts, sunlight or garlic. However pounding a stake through my heart will kill me. And shooting me full of bullets will kill me because I can only heal smaller injuries. Say you pointed a pistol into my abs and shoot me? Well good chances I could get away and survive but shoot me with a shotgun where more damage is caused to my body and I will die like any mortal. Mortal illinsses I can and do come down with. Actually any kind of life threatoning thing that can kill humans can probably kill me though I really don't know. I don't tempt fate to find out my weaknesses. And every full moon I get a terrible headache. I can be moody, short tempored and often prefer things to be done my way. I hate admitting when I am wrong either though when it can be proved that I really am... well I do apologize. <br>
<br>
I suppose I should tell you about the society that raised me, trained me and now employs me. They are called The Society Of Watchers (T.S.O.W.)and since the first vampire this society has existed. It was created to watch the vampires and record their history. All the great ancient vampires have records. The funny thing is they don't know they are being watched. This society never makes themselves known to vampires, we never interfer with the lives of those we watch. We walk amoung them and they have no idea. Most of my coworkers are dhampires, and the rest are mortals. Our lives appear normal, we do normal things. There is nothing about us that sets us apart. We watchers get a few vampires each, depending on the vampire. We get new vampires should one we watch die, or the vampire gets a new watcher should one of us die... So far I have just gotten new vampires. <br>
<br>
The vampire I watched last, has lived for five hundred years and ran a book store. I actually worked for him before he died, thats how close we can get. He died before my eyes when a hunter took his life. I could not stop him, I could not make myself known even to the hunter. My code of honour keeps me from interfering with the order of things. <br>
<br>
This Society raised me, took me from my mother who was also a watcher. Her punishment for involving herself with a vampire was the loss of myself though I have followed her life through the records of her watcher. I have records of my mortal father though I can not even visit his grave for that is where he rests. This society is my life, its my family. I have my own small apartment here in NY. <br>
<br>
My life as a watcher was my destiny from the beginning. I was trained by them in mind control and how to block my mind from even the most powerful vampires. Though I have never been assigned to one of those. My assignments have been on weaker vampires. I am skilled with the computer, I can hack, program and write very well. <br>
<br>
Because of the heat I was in with my last assigment, currently I am without one though I am being paid very well. I own a beautiful black and grey Honda CBR600F4i cycle as well as a 2004 Pontiac Vibe GT. I've modified it somewhat with special aluminum rims. The windows are dark black and I put black lights in the interior as well as purple running lights under the car. I'm pretty mechanical when it comes to cars and cycles. <br>
<br>
Currently I am single, my job can send me all over the world... I don't have time for relationships which is really sad but I'll deal with it. If you see me in the streets well... I could be watching you, or someone else... the mystery is you'll never know... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maxdesire>Max Desire</A> at: 8/30/03 9:05 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showPrevMessage?topicID=21.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showNextMessage?topicID=21.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.emailToFriend?topicID=21.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.threadControl?topicID=21.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=21.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=21.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="kalaberiafrm36">Mortal and Kindred Laws<option value="kalaberiafrm37">Character Biographies<option value="kalaberiafrm38">Character Plotting<option value="kalaberiafrm45">Times Square<option value="kalaberiafrm40">Central Park<option value="kalaberiafrm41">Stanton Isle<option value="kalaberiafrm42">Abandoned Subway<option value="kalaberiafrm43">Chitter Chatter<option value="kalaberiafrm44">Advertisements <option value="kalaberiafrm46">Admin and mods<option value="kalaberiafrm47">Warehouse District</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia>MidnyghtRising</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37>Character Biographies</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br> <a href=http://www.runesofdesire.com><img src=http://runesofdesire.com/rod6.jpg></a><br><br>
