Every once and a while, when I am forced to, I think about God and the natural order of the world. And so the other day I came to the conclusion, whether it is right or wrong I do not know, that for proof of God you do not have to look very far at all. I am not talking about something intangible or an abstraction when I talk about proof. I am talking about solid reasoned out fact.  Look at the nature, look at the plants. Look at the animals. Look at the laws of predator/prey. When one is scarce the other grows, when one grows too much for the scarce food supply the numbers fall. Plants, I believe, are *pure* un-altered LIFE. They are creations of God. Nature is a pure creation of God, physics, the natural world, animals, plants, the whether. They are ALL constant reminders of God in a world where people seem to take too much notice of the things MAN has made. And we all know where the things man makes eventually end up. Eroded, dead, hollowed out. Because that is all it is. But nature.............nature is forever. No matter how badly we try to wipe it out or alter it. Its still a work of God. It will still be here, in some way. When we needlessly destroy or mock or trash it. Its almost like an insult to God. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
Nature in and of itself is chaotic. Plants will grow where they want, animals are un-predictable (most of the time) and all manner of earthquakes, typhoons, and storms will strike when and where they please. But if you take a closer look you will see that certain laws govern what these meteorological events will occur, how sever they will be and where they will occur. Animals, including humans, must meet specific biological  requirements. they *need* a certain amount of calories for their vital organs to sustain life each day. They need a certain number to move their limbs and move about. They need a specific amount of vitamins to function properly and protect against disease.  Too much or too little and they will die. This is natural law. Gravity.....if the gravity on planet Earth were just the tiniest bit stronger or weaker it would not be able to support life. The laws of physics. People know what they are, but no one is quite sure WHY they work. They are all dependant on forces. But the main force is gravity. Which no one has yet to explain. We know that it is “The natural force of attraction between any two massive bodies, which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. “  But that doesn’t really explain what causes it, why it occurs and where it comes from. Everyone takes advantage of how physics work and that they are always around us. But most of the time we fail to realize that they are true for the universe, not just us. These laws make it possible for us to live, to exist on this world. The Laws of Physics are often called the Laws of Nature, however, from my inert thinking.....they are not the Laws of Nature, but PART of the Laws of Nature. Along with the laws that dictate that THIS animal needs THIS amount of nutrients and calories to live. THIS plant at THIS age need THIS total time of sunlight and THIS amount of nutrients to live, and what's more it needs THIS amount to actually grow. These are LAWS, are Laws of Nature, the laws that I believe God set up in order that life would be supported here. Why not have things in a chaotic manner? Why isn’t everything a jumbled up mess? Why isn’t it skewed or warped?  These Natural Laws have to come from SOMEWHERE, you do not get something out of nothing. To produce forces of this magnitude that effect the universe is the mark of a God.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>

It reminded me of a little joke/anecdote/&lt;insert correct word here&gt; where some man is mouthing off to God that He can create life just like God.  God takes the challenge and grabs a handful of dirt.  Man does the same.  God then says 'No, get your own dirt'.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=t0mmyt>T0mmyT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;><b>Mead Master<br>of the Grand Hooley<br>Cheeky Boy</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#B87333>(9/24/03 12:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Observations on God and Nature</span><hr size=1> or something like that....   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heartjoys>heartjoys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:purple;><b>Velvet-Steel Wannabe</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 1281<br> <font color=#B87333>(9/24/03 1:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/CladdaghAward.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Observations on God and Nature</span><hr size=1> Not &quot;needless&quot; at all Frost Wraith....I enjoyed reading it!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wordwolf>WordWolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;><b>Sir WordWolf,<br>Keeper of Odd Knowledge,<br>Bachelor-at-Arms</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#B87333>(9/25/03 12:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Observations on God and Nature</span><hr size=1> A botanist, a surgeon, an engineer and a politician <br>

Now if it would just snow... *tramps outside and does a snow-dance*  Now snow... that is my favorite of the seasons God created.  There is a special sort of beauty in a sparkly layer of pure white over everything.  I always just hate to walk down the driveway after a snow... it's like my footprints disgrace the beauty.<br>

<br>
you get a storm coming off the mountains and it drops all the snow at the base.<br>
<br>
i've gone to bed with the temp in the 60's and woke up to snow. <br>
<br>
when i was in Michigan and saw what the lake can do to snow it reminded me in a way of wyoming. <br>
