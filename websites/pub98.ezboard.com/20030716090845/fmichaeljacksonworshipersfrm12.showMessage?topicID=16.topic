Chapter 1<br>
Dinner is In The Oven<br>
<br>
“Mom, Is Dad going to be at my game today?” Jason asked. Jason plays Little League Baseball.<br>
“Yes, he promised he would be there to see you hit a home run.” Leo said rubbing her hand through her son’s hair.<br>
“I hope he’s home on time for dinner.” Mae said, “We want to make his favorite, right Sheryl?”<br>
“Yep! Going to make Daddy’s favorite food, Right Chris?” she asked hugging her little brother.<br>
“Yeah, Lasagna!” Christopher shouted.<br>
“He should be home on time.” Leo said placing her hand on her stomach. She is twenty- eight weeks pregnant with her fifth child. She and Michael had a discussion about whether to keep the baby or not. Leo loves children, she works with them everyday but the fact is Michael is almost never home. That is why she is having second thoughts about having the baby. <br>
“Mom?” Sheryl asked, “Are you sure he is coming?”<br>
“I’m sure, Jason get ready and we’ll leave.” Leo said packing juices and snacks for her kids. When Jason was dressed in his uniform and cleats, he came downstairs and sat at the table.<br>
“What’s wrong?” Leo asked looking at his sad face.<br>
“Dad’s not coming. I know it. He’ll probably send someone from the office to tape the game for him.” Jason said, “I hate it that he works so much. Sometimes I wish he didn’t get promoted at all.”<br>
“Now, Jason. You have to understand your father is making money so that you can have a roof over your head, two bathrooms, 4 bedrooms, a big basement, a family room, kitchen, den-” Leo started, “Why are we having this conversation again.”<br>
“You have a job too, Mom.” He said, “You work.”<br>
“Yes I do but I don’t make as much money that your father does.” She said sitting next to him, “I mean he is co-owner of Brunjax Inc.”<br>
“Why isn’t he his own boss?” Jason asked.<br>
“Because they have a president.” She said, “Just because you created it doesn’t make you the boss.” <br>
“Oh, well I think Dad needs to be his own boss.” He said picking up his glove.<br>
“Are you ready?” she asked getting up slowly.<br>
“Come on!” Mae screamed from outside, “We’re going to be late.”<br>
“We’re coming!” Leo said, locking the door behind her.<br>
They got in the van, the kids were watching  “Spiderman” with Toby Maguire on DVD. When they got to Blue Bell Field, Jason practically bolted out the van to his teammates on the field. The game didn’t start until 5:00pm and it was 4:45 now. Leo took out her cell phone and called Michael at work.<br>
“Hello Brunjax Inc., this is Julie how can I help you?” the secretary asked.<br>
“Hi Julie, this is Mrs. Jackson, is my husband there?” Leo asked, “It’s important.”<br>
“Oh Leonadra, he is but he is in a meeting right now. Can I take a message?” she asked nicely.<br>
“Yes, Tell him that Jason’s gme is at 5:00pm” Leo said, “How’s Brownie and Novalee?”<br>
“Fine, they slept through the night.” Julie said with a little chuckle, “They are good babies.”<br>
“That’s good.” Leo said, “We’ll I will talk to you later.”<br>
“Bye Mrs. Jackson.” Julie said hanging up. <br>
“Let’s go get a seat you guys.” Leo said getting everyone out the van. They all sat at the bottom of the bleachers. <br>
“Go Jason!” Leo shouted, “Hit it for Momma!”<br>
Jason blushed, he spit in his hands dug his feet in the dirt beside the plate, and waited for the pitcher to pitch. He threw the ball and it barely beaned Jason in the head.<br>
“Ball 1!” the umpire shouted.<br>
“That’s okay baby don’t let him shake you.” Leo said.<br>
A man wearing coke bottle glasses came over to Leo.<br>
“Leonadra? I’m from Brunjax. Mr. Jackson asked me to come and tape the game for him.” He said holding the camcorder in his hand.<br>
“What? Again?” she said dejectedly, “Fine.”<br>
“Come on Bro, hit that ball.” Mae shouted mimicking him with the bat.<br>
Jason smiled then frowned when he saw his mothers face. Her expression was, “He didn’t make it.”  He got angry after that and gripped the bat hard. The pitcher make his second pitch and Jason hit that ball right out of the park. He ran to first, stole second and third. He was trying to steal home, when a friend got 4 balls and walked. They won the game! Jason jumped and shouted with the rest of the team. The coach takes the team out for pizza afterwards. <br>
“See you when you come home.” Leo said taking the other kids home.<br>
“Bye Mom.” Jason said getting in the coaches 4x4. <br>
“Can we cook Daddy’s food now?” Chris asked, “I’m hungry.”<br>
“Sure, I don’t know if he will be home for it though but sure.” Leo said pulling away.<br>
**************<br>
“Okay,” Michael said while he was presenting a very important kind of programming to the marketers, and producers of Brunjax, “Thanks for your time.”<br>
Everyone took their pamphlets and dispersed. Michael breathed a sigh of relief.<br>
“Michael, good show my boy. Now I need that new program on my desk first thing tomorrow morning.” Mr. Crooks said shaking his hand, “Nice work.”<br>
“Thank You, Mr. Crooks. First thing tomorrow.” He said going into his office, “Hey Juels, what’s new?”<br>
“Your wife called again today.” She said handing the note.<br>
“Jason’s game is at 5, please be there, it should be over by 8 or 9.” He read, “I sent a guy to tape it.” <br>
“That’s not good enough.” Julie said, “Jason wanted you to be there.”<br>
“Well, I was busy.” Michael whined, “It’s 8:45, maybe I can go to the field and see if they are still playing.”<br>
“Good Luck.” Julie said handing him his coat.<br>
Michael jetted down the stairs and got into his Mercedes Benz, and drove to Blue Bell Field. He climbed up the hill and looked down into the field. No one was there. He sighed deeply because he knew he had disappointed Jason.<br>
“Damn.” He said to himself. <br>
He got back in his car and drove back to the office. <br>
*********<br>
“Mommy!” Sheryl shouted setting the table, “Jason is still in his room.”<br>
“Well go get him.” She said checking on the lasagna in the oven.<br>
Sheryl went upstairs to Jason’s room. It was closed and loud music was blaring.<br>
“Jason!” Sheryl yelled, “Jason, open the door.”<br>
Jason heard someone calling him, and turned down the music. It was Sheryl. He opened the door.<br>
“What is it?” he asked. He looked really upset.<br>
“Mommy wants you to come down and get ready for dinner.” She said, “What’s wrong? Is it Dad?”<br>
“Yeah, he is never there for us.” Jason said looking at his little sister.<br>
“You had it better then the rest of us.” She said coming in.<br>
“How so?” he asked<br>
“You were the first born.” She said, “You got all the attention from Dad.” <br>
“Well, now I’m not getting any attention.” He said taking his cleats and glove off the floor and putting them in the trash.<br>
“What are you doing?” she asked, “Mommy paid good money for those.”<br>
“I’m quitting baseball. I’m not going to take interest in something that Dad isn’t even going to come and see.” He said folding his uniform up.<br>
“Well, let’s go eat. That food smells good.” She said leaving his room.<br>
He followed, then Mae followed him and Christopher followed her. They all came downstairs a Leo put the lasagna on a plate. They sat at the table, and waited for what seemed to be forty-five minutes, which is exactly how long, before they started eating.<br>
“He’s late again.” Mae said taking some salad.<br>
“He’s always late.” Chris said with his mouth full of garlic bread.<br>
************<br>
It’s 9:30 and Michael would be home right now but he is finishing the new program for Mr. Crook, he overbearing toupee wearing, Vienna sausage dick of a boss. <br>
“Good Night, Mr. Jackson.” Julie said leaving, “Sorry you missed the game.”<br>
“Yeah,” Michael said sighing. He sopped staring at the computer for a minute and looked over at his family’s picture on his desk. Leonadra had strawberry blonde highlights in her light brown hair, a small scar on her cheek and, dark brown eyes, she wasn’t white but she was vanilla brown.  He then looked at his kids, the apples of his eye. He smiled and then frowned when he realized he could’ve had lasagna instead of cheap imitation pasta for dinner. He huffed and went back to work. <br>
He finished around 11 o’ clock and placed the Finesse program on Mr. Crooks desk and went home. <br>
************<br>
At home, Leonadra had just finished putting the dishes away, but not before she made a plate for Michael. She heard his car pulling up in the driveway and went upstairs. She put her favorite perfume on and laid there on the bed spread eagle in the nude. Michael came in and went upstairs, smelling her perfume. He saw her on the bed. He quickly took off his suit and lay down next to her. He touched her body. She cringed and quickly drew the covers over her. <br>
“Dinner is in the oven Michael.” She said turning on her side, “Good Night”<br>
