Since Wynter had sold it to him he had torn it completely apart inside, and had it entirely remodeled. The work finished last Saturday, and it was now busily pumping out the hard bass rhythms of industrial and gothic music. The bank of video monitors showed the inside of the bar and club, the patrons eating, consuming liquor, and dancing. He no longer ran sex shows out of the club, or allowed drugs to flow freely. As he typed at the computer, and watched the action in the club, yet another shredded stuffed animal flew across his field of vision. Since Nikke died, he had not allowed Cybel to leave his attention for a minute. She had cut herself with broken glass, until she had more wounds than whole flesh. She had pierced her skin with anything long and sharp enough to do the job. When Prophet had finally found her, she was near frenzy, her blood covered the floors and walls of the little bathroom in her haven. Since bringing her here to stay with him, she was more childlike than ever. Cybel threw fits, shredded her toys, broke things, and spent way too much time rocking herself gently, and crooning lullabys to herself. Occasionally she would become lucid, usually only long enough to rant something about murder, and killing them all, wasn't her fault, tried to be grown up, and protect the city. It was all gibberish, and disconnected, like a nightmare gone horribly askew. Prophet watched as the poor little beheaded teddy bear plopped lamely onto the desk beside him, then turned in his chair to watch his sister. Cybel was covered in teddy bear stuffing, and torn limbs of half a dozen of of her toys. Prophet kept a good supply, if she didn't have them, she would destroy anything else she could get her hands on. &quot; Cybel, your running out of toys again Hun, you really should be nicer to your...&quot; Prophets words cut off, as he dodged a stuffed lion, missing its tail and front legs. Prophet sighed, and went to the closet, bringing out a box filled with new toys, and gave Cybel a few more. He sat down on the floor with her, and just put his arms around her as she rocked slowly back and forth and sang a child's song under her breath. Quietly, he spoke to her in a gentle tone.&quot; Cybel, I have to go out for a few, we need to feed, and its been a few days, you have to play with Chauncy a bit, he needs some love, but I will be back in an hour or so&quot; Cybel stopped rocking, her eyes brimmed with crimson tears as she said to him in a mere whisper &quot; not go out brother...you will die too, they all die, they all murder...your next I know they gonna kill you too maybe. they will kill me too they hate us, they hate us all...don't go brother you'll be dead, then I will die too&quot; the tears of blood streamed down her cheeks, staining the alabaster skin in rivulets of bloody sorrow. &quot; No Cybel, they wont come after me. I'm smart enough to steer clear of those fucks...but we wont last long holed up here in our little fortress. I will use the sewers, Lowry is down there too, he will watch my back. I will be right back, play with Chauncy, and call me on the 'puter if you really need me.&quot; Prophet left his sister as she played catch the shredded stuffed animal with Chauncy, the over grown ghouled alligator they kept as a pet. Prophet hit the sewers, and came up near the old abandon rail station, he made a few stops, watching things like he normally did, even though he wasn't scourge anymore. He saw a figure walking the length of the tracks, and with his heightened sense of vision, he could tell it was Simon, some random new vampire he knew about, hung with some creepy lame guy named Doctor Demento or something. Prophet let his thoughts wander, forgetting about Simon, and the city, and just focused on what he was going to do next. He had Cybel to take care of. He had to survive, so she could survive, simple as that. &quot;Politics, and assholes&quot; he whispered out loud,&quot; Why do they always come in pairs?&quot;<br>
Prophet hopped down off the loading dock, and thought about getting someone to feed Cybel. As he wandered down the darkened alley, the thought passed through his mind ' Some times I just want to Scream...it would be very calming'<br>
a covey of bird screeched and they took startled flight into the air, as a shrill high pitched scream of utter frustration echoed in the night.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stephencrowley>Stephen Crowley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/2/03 5:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> calming screams = midnitemage</span><hr size=1> Simons head shot up as he heard a shrill distant scream float through the air. Simon and Fredric were just out on a stroll having reached the skateboard park about a block from the Beach Boardwalk as they turned and began to head back. Simon took a look back towards the boardwalk, then out to sea. His expression was mixed between pleasure and curiosity as he began to turn completely around with a huge urge to investigate.<br>
<br>
&quot;Simon, you are lagging behind. Leave the kine to their business. We have other things to do.&quot; scolded Fredric. Simon lowering his head slightly turned and began walking back down the tracks stuffing his hands into his pockets sighing in annoyance. Fredric looked to Simon and moved his hand to his lips as if he had a cigarette between his fingers. The signal was all to familiar to Simon as he absently pulls out the box of smokes, opens it and lets the good doctor grab one. Replacing the box into his pocket and producing a lighter, Dr. Demarco takes it from him and begins to light the cigarette as Simon shields the flame with both hands from the wind blowing down the railroad path.<br>
<br>
His thoughts then drifted down to the tracker strapped to his ankle and his face sowerd a bit as he pulled the hood over his head and kept his face in the dark. Fredric threw him several glances, even attempted to ask Simon what the trouble was several times and the only reply he received in return was a slight sigh and silence afterwards. Simon was too caught up within his thoughts and didn't care much for talking with what he felt was his warden walking next to him all the time. Simon grew thoroughly tired of being his sire's lap dog and each passing day just drove him further and further away.<br>
<br>
&quot;One day.&quot; Simon said in an almost inaudible voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that Simon? I'm sorry. I could not hear you.&quot; asked Fredric.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Simon relayed as he tromped along over the rocky path next to the tracks. &quot;Nothing.&quot; he whispered to himself once more.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=32.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=32.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=32.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=32.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=32.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm20">SchreckNET™ (Nos only)<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.241b<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
