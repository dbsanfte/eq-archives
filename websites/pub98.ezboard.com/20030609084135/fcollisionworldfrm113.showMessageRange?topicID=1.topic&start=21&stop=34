Laurena froze up as he wrapped his arms around her.  Her heart pounded in fear as she started to remember...she tried to pull away feebly, but she wasn't strong enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; she admitted softly, fearfully.  &quot;I...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why'd you go with Tryphaena?&quot; he continued.<br>
<br>
This question was the cause of much puzzlement as well.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Because...I...&quot; she shut her eyes again.  &quot;You fell...she said I caught you...and you...she said the demon had no part of it...you...had every right, I...&quot;  She struggled again, feebly.  &quot;This is another dream! It has to be! I'm nothing!  Only good for the cage...Lance said...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lance?&quot; Azalea interrupted loudly, in disbelief.  &quot;Laurena, Lance is dead!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He was here!&quot; Laurena shouted desperately. &quot;He was here...and he hated me...I let him die...&quot; she trembled as she wept.  &quot;But he was happier dead...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;you're delirious,&quot; Azalea decided, shaking her head.  &quot;Tryphaena packed your head with lies, Laurena!  Lance is dead!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How I can I believe you?  Any of you...this could be a dream too...a wonderful dream...&quot; she whispered.  Then she cried out in pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aaah!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Laurena!&quot;<br>

Far above them, the black moon Nulla was reaching a drastic phase...the full moon.  Her pupils moved and became fully rounded,  and as they turned into perfect circles, a light shockwave breached the room coming off of her body, shaking the chains on the walls.  Her hair was turning white.<br>
<br>
It was her turn.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is...&quot; she answered, huskily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, guests.  I knew you would be here soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tryphaena emerged form the shadows, smirking.  Her hips swayed from side to side in a wanton manner as she walked, a smugness plastered on her face. From her arms draped a beautiful, deadly black cobra. &quot;I made it easy enough for you to get down here...but you will not have the same luxury getting out.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli, don't--&quot; Laurena gasped, doubled over.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, so she broke through the dream spell,&quot; Tryphaena purred, disappointed.  &quot;Oh well.  She's broken now, all the same.&quot;<br>
<br>
Azalea rose her staff in warning.  &quot;You have five seconds,&quot; she said, her voice strangely deep and resounding.  Ribbons of power flowed over her robes, and the Staff pulsed brighter and brighter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, like a pathetic mage like...&quot; she spat, looking at Azalea.  Then she saw her full moon pupils, glowing like bright orbs within their dark blue chambers, and shut up, her own eyes wide with surprise.  &quot;Oh--&quot;<br>
<br>
Azalea sent a black bolt of lightning soaring in her direction.  Tryphaena flew back against the stone wall, and hit the floor, her snake slithering about her stunned body.  The black mage had never even said a word, or made a move, save a quiet gesture of her staff.  In the presence of her power, Kaed's pain spell seemed dull and throbbing, but Laurena felt it eatign her away...<br>
<br>
&quot;Bitch!&quot; Tryphaena snarled, struggling to her winged feet.  &quot;You will pay---!&quot;<br>
<br>
An inferno exploded around her, catching her on fire.  Tryphaena shrieked in pain, falling to the ground, but before the flames could consume her, they disappeared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Playing games with me, witch?!&quot; she shrieked.  <br>
<br>
Azalea gave her a cold glare.  &quot;And I thought you were the one playing games.  You are boring me, siren.  Either die or retreat.&quot;<br>
<br>
The dark siren laughed shrilly.  &quot;Oh-ho-ho!  Threatening me!  You have nerve, witch.  Much nerve!&quot;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Laurena had dragged herself out of the cage, and had fallen in a heap on the floor.  She gasped the sweet air of freedom and wanted to sob.  But shakily she grasped the bars, and pulled herself up in a standing position.  Her eyes fixed on Tryphaena, her heart fixed now on Aeli.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dream or not...&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I'm protecting you...my love...&quot;   <br>

<br>
&quot;Aeli...no...&quot;<br>
<br>
Tryphaena cackled.  &quot;Your chickadee looks a bit pallid, half demon,&quot; she snickered.  She drew her bullwhip, her snake Morbida slithering about her neck protectively.<br>
<br>
Azalea glowed with dark energy, feeling the power of Maiem being unleashed in her body.  The feeling was intoxicating.<br>

She stumbled and fell.  Taking the snake form around her neck, she flug it at him spitefully.  Morbida flew at him, and sank its poisonous fangs inot Aeli's arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;No...!&quot; Laurena cried form within the bubble.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you will pay, bitch!&quot; Azalea cried.  She formed a huge engery ball and flung it at the raven woman.  The dungeon lit up in a mass of light and sound.<br>
<br>
Laurena fought her way out of the bubble and grabbed Aeli into her arms, covereing him with her broken wing and her good one as the ceiling crumbled around them form the force.  Morbida's poison was lethal, she had nearly been a victim of it once.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli...I told you not to...&quot; she said, close to his face as the dungeon was filled with light.  She held him close, shaking, staring into his eyes.  &quot;I told you...Aeli...&quot;  she winced as rocks tumbled on her and hit her damaged wings, but nothing hit Aeli so she was satisfied, though pained.<br>

But she still cackled as she saw him try a feeble attempt to kill her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't waste the little energy you have left,&quot; she spat.  &quot;Spend these golden minutes while you can.  No one survives Morbida's poison!&quot; She said as blood ran over her ruby dark lips.  &quot;Such a poison is a toxic almost nothing can heal! I know the secret, but it won't save you if I won't tell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Laurena still knelt in a protective position over the floor, tears running from her eyes at his words.  &quot;I don't want you to protect me...I just want you to be happy...&quot; she stifled a sob that tore at her chest.  Again she pulled herself up.  It was harder this time, but she managed it.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is it, half demon,&quot; Tryphaena sneered from her place among the rubble.  &quot;Let it take you.  Don't fight it, you're only making it worse.  Feel the venom coursing your veins as lightning does the crimson sky.  Feel it ravaging your body.  When it reaches your pathetic heart...you will sleep the sleep of the dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Azalea snarled.  She was worried about Aeli, but in her demonlike state, she did not have the power to heal, only to destroy.  And destroy she would.<br>
<br>
She began to chant.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Um klau de ka, asawa...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly the dungeon went cold.  Even Tryphaena, who had been laughing, went silent and skittish.  EWveryone in the room felt faint, and the dungeons were set in perverted light.<br>
<br>
A tall figure cloaked in black appeared, walking as if on air.  One could not see her face, though her eyes glowed yellow from beneath the hood.  The figure stopped, as if to smell the air, and the sound of the air entering her nostrils sounded like a banshee's scream.  With her breath, Laurena felt as if she were sucking in a bit of her soul.<br>
<br>
The feminine figure then turned her head in Laurena and Aeli's direction, and the air hummed dangerously with power.  Laurena blinked heavily, feeling tired.<br>
<br>
Flames...<br>
<br>
The stranger moved slowly toward them.  As she approached, Laurena found the air acrid and hard to breathe.  She choked slightly as the figure neared.<br>
<br>
Laurena heard Azalea chanting but couldn't care about the mage for the moment.    She limped in front of Aeli, her eyes caring but so determined that her physical wounds couldn't hinder her if they tried.  She stood in front of him, her back leaning against him slightly, wings spread in a protective stance.  Her broken wing did not spread as far, but...<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll protect you, Aeli.  You cannot hurt this one,&quot; she whispered faintly, her voice only reaching that high on its own.<br>
<br>
The figure chuckled, a distant, booming sound that filled the air like distant thunder.  She did not slow until she was inches before the siren.<br>
<br>
&quot;Raven...&quot; Laurena whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;No...my lady, you are not strong enough,&quot; Tryphaena pleaded, humbled by the stranger's presence.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I...have strength enough...for this...&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> A pale, shriveled hand reached up and touched Laurena's face.  She bit back the urge to scream, the touch was cold and painful, filled with death.  With the touch, floated away the warmth of her body, and she felt weary.  But she stood strong in front of Aeli, determined to defend him with her last drop of blood.<br>
<br>
The Ankh on her neck began to glow brightly.<br>
<br>
The woman shrank back from the golden light, a scream like no other piercing the air.  The woman's figure unraveled into blackened dust, and lifted up and away into the upper chasms of the castle.<br>
<br>
Laurena's knees buckled beneath her, letting out a loose breath of relief and pain.  &quot;Aeli...&quot; was all she could say before she hit the floor, cold and drained from the deathlike touch.<br>
<br>
Tryphaena snickered.  &quot;You woke her up.  She's angry now...&quot;<br>
<br>
And Azalea had never stopped chanting, now glowing with black magic.<br>

Aeli looked at Laurena, his silver eyes struggling not to loose thier brightness and his skin paling.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was never happy until I met you, Laurena.&quot; He turned back to Tryphaena. &quot;And if I die a happy man, that's fine by me.&quot;<br>

What was he saying?  How could he have ever been happy with her around?  All she caused was trouble and pain to him...all she was was a songbird...<br>
<br>
She didn't want him to die!<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli....&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Azalea finished the chant.<br>
<br>
&quot;Es ku basa, ontawa...Aeli mai ku basa, ontawa.  Laurena mai ku basa, ontawa.  La'azala ku basa, ONTAWA!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Her staff struck the ground.  The ground rocked as if it were being shaken by a mighty godlike hand of destruction.  The walls began to waver and groan beneath their burden, and the air exploded with fire and dust.<br>
<br>
The entire castle shook and groaned in defeat, every walkway twisted, every stone crumbled, every window shattered.<br>
<br>
In the dungeons, Azlea was untouched by the fire and chaos.  Her eyes glowed with the evil fires of the dark elf, and the horrible, wonderful powers of Maiem.  She stood, closing her eyes in exotic pleasure of the magic coursing through her body, though the light of her eyes shone through her eyelids.<br>
<br>
Tryphaena knew at once it was the Armageddon spell.  A spell that could destroy an enitre city. She knew that she was probably doomed, along with them as well.  But she would not die without that Ankh in her hands!<br>
<br>
She dragged herself out of her bed of rubble and made her way through the fire and dust and falling stone, eyes glowing with murder.  A dagger gleamed in her hand as she limped forward through the chaos.<br>
<br>
There she was, on the ground, looking about in fear.  But she was forcing herself to get up too, though her limb trembled with the audacity.  She looked at Aeli through the fire, and knew they were doomed.  Tryphaena watched as Laurena embraced him tightly and waited for the end.<br>
<br>
Laurena clasped Aeli in a vice grip, scared, confused, but knowing that whatever happened she was in Aeli's arms, to her, the safest place in all the world.  She looked up into his eyes and said, &quot;I love you,&quot; but her words were drowned out by the screaming of the fire around them.<br>
<br>
In his pale silver eyes, however, she caught the bitter, dark reflection of Tryphaena behind them, dragging herself through the flame.<br>
<br>
Laurena spun around just as Tryphaena let out a fierce battle cry and raised the dagger viciously into the fiery air.  Laurena spread her arms out in front of Aeli again, her wings spread, ready to die for him and only him, crying out in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;TIME TO DIE, SISTER DEAR!!!&quot; Tryphaena screamed insanely.<br>

Aeli had been holding the arrow that missed, with his powers. Immediately, the arrow speed from it's hiding place in the shadows and plunged into Tryphaena's back.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, it's not.&quot; Aeli's eyes had stopped glowing red.<br>

<br>
&quot;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Such a scream would ring in Laurena's memory forever.  But now she looked down in horror as Tryphaena dropped to the smoldering, shaking ground, blood gushing from her chest as she glared at her with dullened eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not over...sister dear...&quot;<br>
<br>
LAurena watched her die, and saw her enveloped in flame.  Tears of pity stung her eyes, as was the smoke and dust.  But again she turned to Aeli, and saw he was still fading, the poison quickening in his blood.  She held him again with desperation and covered him with her wings.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli...!&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, they were falling.  The gorund crumbled beneath them and they fell, into unending darkness.  Laurena gripped to Aeli firmly, as tighly as she could, but somehow they were separated, and fell into eternal void.  <br>
<br>
Azalea's words echoed, a duet with Tryphaena's deathsong.<br>
