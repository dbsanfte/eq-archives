*Today was my friend Theresa's birthday.  I still haven't bought anything for her, but hopefully I'll make it to Hobby Lobby tomorrow.  I plan on getting her an old Tiffany style lamp...they're really cute.  I got her the cutest card, I hope she liked it as much as I did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
*On Sunday night, my friend Teresa made Profession of Faith at her church (its where they become full members) and I met this really great guy.  I had seen him before at school, but we've never talked.  He's actually really good friends with Brett, who I went out with once and only once 2 weekends a go.  So anyways, at church he comes over to talk to someone in my group, and before I know it, its just me and Brandon talking.  I talked to him for prob an hour then.  But, we had a band concert back at school, so he's also in band so I talked to him a lot again just like an hour later.  Then yesterday I kept running into him in the halls at school <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  on accident of course.  Then today it was so cute, he was talking to this guy as I walked by with my friend and he just stops talking to the guy watches me walk towards him and says &quot;hi Katie&quot;.  LOL, i am such a minimalist, but that *SO* made my day.  But the thing is, he's good friends with the guy I went out with.  When I first started talking to him he kept asking me when I was going to go out with Brett again.  My friend Tracy thinks he just kept asking that to see if I had feelings for Brett (nothing but friendly ones!).  Brandon is a Soph. (what is it with me and younger guys?!) and we drive the same car <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  LOL Im a dork, but these past few days getting to know him have been great.<br>
<br>
*Book talk.  I'm reading The Adventures of Huck Finn right now for my Lit Class at school and its alright, but I don't like being forced to read a book.  If ya like outdoorsy stuff like that, i suggest you give Huck a whirl.  But, I recommend A Midsummers NIght Dream by Shakespeare.  I read that at school recently and i LOVED it.  Its a really great story once you work yourself into the language.  Try it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

*Today was my downward spiral into reality.  Did I really think things would continue to go my way?  Or at least a teeny tiny bit my way?  We're taking the MEAP test at school this week.  The MEAP is a Michigan test where if you do good on 4 areas of it (science, math, reading, and writing) they give you $2500 for college.  Well, things were going good on my math section today till the final question.  20 minutes of staring at the question got me no where and all the other kids were dismissed.  This is what I get for thinking the math would be easy...and it was till my blond side took over.  LoL, it was actually the easiest question but I tend to complicate things.<br>
<br>
*On a brighter note, I had a chemistry test today on which I think I did okay for once.  Tomorrow I'll let you know that I most likely failed it or something <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Lets hope not.<br>
<br>
*I talked to Brandon a lot today again.  I was telling my friend Tracy how I talked to him forever (okay the total 4 minutes we have between classes, but, that added up with a bunch of &quot;Hi!&quot; during the day...yeah never mind im pathetic).  When I said that we were by my locker after school, which is right by the exit to the parking lot.  Then she tells me, &quot;When you were getting stuff out of your locker a minute ago he walked by the exit and was staring at you&quot;.  I really think she should have told me that ealier.  I am really starting to like this guy if you can't tell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
*Nothing new for me on any books sorry.  But, 2 weeks ago I read 2 books in the series &quot;Diary of a Teenage Girl&quot;.  Those were really good.  I liked how you could see the transformation in her life before and after she accepted Christ.  It made me see how I should live my life more Godly, which is really really hard to do sometimes.<br>
<br>
*Speaking of which, Im in the process of making Profession of Faith at my church, if, IF Pastor Will calls to set up an appt. He hasn't called anyone about it yet. *tisk tisk*  <br>
<br>

*Today while I was talking with Brandon (im starting to think he waits for me before 7th hour) he asked me if I was going to go to the Courtyard/Kareoke dance next Sat at school.  I said I didn't know yet and then he took my hand and told me he hoped I would be there so we could dance together.<br>
<br>
*That really helped boost my spirits bc an hour before that I got into an argument with one of my friends and I was really worried and upset.  But when I had class with Lindsi a few minutes after I talked to Brandon, it was like nothing had happened and it was all good.  That was a huge relief after worrying all 5th and 6th hours.  <br>
<br>
*What else happened today? I think I failed the science section of the MEAP today.  Yeah, Mr. Dykema will get a kick out of that.  <br>
<br>
*My dad paid me $10 to go pick up an application for this summer from a business right up the street from my house.  He didn't think I would go in and get one for myself.  So I did.  I have to wait until Sat. to see if I got a job at a gym for women.  I hope I get it, but the lady who owns it is giving first dibs to her niece so I have to wait and see if she wants  it.  I hope not <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I need a job!!!!!!!!!!  Everything falls through and summer is almost here!  <br>

*Thanks Hazel, that makes me feel better.  You were in chemistry right? Well, Mr. Dykema says no chemistry students has ever failed the science section.  <br>
<br>
*Last night I got into a HUGE fight with 2 of my friends.  We went to Hobby Lobby to get a lamp for another friends birthday, and we were just all going to pay for one, because they were really expensive.  Well we get there and Lins and Trace don't like the lamps and are all mean about it, and it really hurt my feelings bc I thought they were sooo cute.  So I decide I'll get Theresa a tiny lamp so I can afford it by myself and I go off by myself to find one.  Then I didn't say anything to the other 2 till we got to the mall bc they ditched me at the store.  Well, I had to go get my mom a gift from Kohls, so I said they could either come with me or meet me outside the movie theater in a half hour, thinking they would come with me.  No.  They take off without saying a word.  Then when I finally get to the movie theater Tracy is all, whats the problem? We didn't do anything to you.&quot;  So I say, &quot;if its going to be all my fault like it always is lets not talk about it.&quot; Well of course Tracy wants to talk about it, so there we are sitting at a table in the food court fighting and Im crying. It was *so* embarressing.  Its hard when you go away with a total of 3 people, cause people get left out and last night it was me and it hurts, oh does it hurt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/shakehead.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Now I have to go spend the rest of the afternoon with them today bc of marching band.  *Lord, help us to work this out and continue on!*<br>
<br>
*Marching Band.  I hate those 2 words <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This week in Holland is the Tulip Festival if anyone has heard of it (besides Hazel!).  Well, its a huge Dutch thing and kinda neat.  Well, there is a marching band parade every year, and since we're one of the dutchest schools around, we get to march in it.  Last year it was blazing hot, this year, its 50 degrees which is perfect.  But, its supposed to rain!!!!  NOOOOOOOOO! LoL! That is horrible, marching in the rain.  Lets pray the rain doesnt come like they said it would.<br>
<br>

Maybe you just need to distance yourself from them and let them cool down. I'm afraid, though, if it REALLY gets on your nerves, you might blow up at them. But you shouldn't be silenced because of others. Tell them calmly that you don't like the way they are treating you, and that unless they cool down, you just shouldn't hang around them for awhile. It may not work that way in your case necessarily, but you know what?

But on the bus on the way home, Lindsi Tracy and I all crammed into one seat and smelled of wetness cause we were soaked.

*Okay, I know I always talk about Brandon on here, well, bc its the only new thing in my life, but I'm going to start this by talking about him again.  I'm kind of confused about him right now.  Brandon likes me.  He told Tracy today that he did and he had told Brettson (who I went out with and is Tracys cousin), so I know its true.  See, I felt comfortable with him bc I just thought of us as friends.  Sure, maybe I like him more than a friend, but I really didn't want to act on it.  He's really good friends with Brettson, and I still don't know how I feel about Brett.  I like him but I never talk to him. I work at the candy store at lunch break and today Brandon came over and talked to me the entire time I was in there.  Well, Brett and Tracy were sitting in the hall near the store so I could see them.  Appt. Brett told Trace that Brandon likes me but he's sure I'll be tired of Brandon in a week.  He also told her that he was pretty sure he didn't like me anymore, which kind of hurt when she told me bc im so confused right now.  Anyways, Tracy was talking to Brandon after school (meddling in my life like she does alot) and he said that he was going to ask me out on Sat.  See, I don't know what to do.  This has been driving me nuts since Tracy told me. UGH! I am so confused!  I don't know what to do.  Anyone who reads this most likely thinks im shallow and I have no life, but this is a problem to me.  Stuff like this doesn't normally happen.  I should just be THRILLED someone wants to date me, but instead im worried.  I mean, he has to know that I know now, cause of course he had to know tracy would tell me (hello, shes my best friend!!) so if he knows I know that hes going to ask me out, he might ask me sooner, and I don't know.  *Sigh* I just reread that and I'm a dork <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  LoL  I'm going to stop now before any of you think less of me...more so than you already do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/ustarrykatie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StArRyKaTiE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/eviltongue.gif> I HATE Cheese!

*Book...hmmmm I haven't read an actual book just for me in a long time.   I don't know how old the girls on here are, but if you're a bit younger than me (but hey, i still like this book, so i guess age doesn't matter), I recommend the book The Devils Arthmetic.  Its about a girl who goes back in time to a concentration camp in WW2.  It is sooo good.  It really shows how your opinon/outlook can change about something.<br>

*I wore a skirt today to school. I love skirts, does anyone else?  The one I wore today is a long jean skirt with slits up the sides to my knees and I wore a white polo.  I just feel so summery right now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But I just realized that the polo is kind of tight (I started off with a sweater thing on 2, but took it off at lunch) so I never really noticed you could see every line my bra makes.  Geez...I was walking around looking pretty sleezy today.  I love clothes.  Im going to Kohls Friday after school with Tracy to try on clothes.  That is the absolute best.  Taking a pile of clothes you would NEVER buy and go into the dressing rooms and try them on with a friend.  I always try to find at least one &quot;britney spears&quot; outfit to try on just to see if I could pull it off.  Its so much fun! I can't wait <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

*I was just holding my kitten Gus and he tried to &quot;attack&quot; me, and he scratched my eye lid.  Owie!  Now i'll most likely get some bacteria in my system.  Nasty.<br>
<br>
*I just read some of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and I'll give it to Mark Twain...he made a lier out of me.  I first said I didn't like this book, but ya know what? I do.  I enjoy it a lot.  Tom is a dork, but Huck sounds like someone I would want to meet.  Tom has the answers to EVERYTHING but not Huck.  He is a bit nieve but he has a good head on his shoulders.  This is a pretty famous book and its about Huck Finn who runs away with the runaway slave Jim.  Well, they are heading for freedom for Jim and they have a lot of adventures along the way (hence the title) and the even meet up in a very cute way with Tom Sawyer, hucks friend from home.  Its just a really cute story, and its growing on me each day I read it.<br>

The worst (or best, depending on how you look at it) thing about graduation is that you need TONS of dressy clothes.  I also need some new shorts/shirts.  I haven't worn my summer shirts for a while, which means I either grew (I know for a fact I didn't) or I became much more self-conscious (very likely) because now I'm annoyed that they show my stomach so much.  Gah, sometimes I feel sooo fat! <br>

I am getting really frusterate bc everything else has fallen through and I'm tired of calling places only to hear they are not hiring.

*Today we had a song/scripture chapel at my school and I wanted to post the lyrics to one of the songs we usually sing.  You might have heard it and its a benediction type thing.  <br>

Okay, first there's a boy at my school whos lung collapsed for the 3rd time and hes in the hospital and needs surgery.  Then a student at a local high school ran a red light and hit a young boy from the middle school.  The boy died a day later and the whole community is taking it hard.  Plus to make things even worse, the middle school where that young boy went, 2 parents of students recently comitted suicide, so they are having lots of problems.  That middle school is in need of lots of prayer, so please pray!  Thanks you guys!!<br>

The school year here is winding down so that means tons of work and tests and blah blah blah.  I went out with Brandon this weekend.  He is soooo sweet but Im not sure if I want to be more than friends.  I know he likes me.  He told me.  The only thing that bothered me was that he seems so sure we're going to start dating seriously and be bf and gf.  How does he know what I'm thinking?  I like his as a friend...ugh! He asked me if I liked him, and i say after a moment of silence, &quot;Yeah, I think so...I don't know you that well yet so I just don't know&quot;.  I think I'm still hung up on Brettson.  It doesn't help that they're really good friends.  Now I have to see Brandon at school and I don't know what to do.  Should I tell him I want to start off really slow and JUST be friends first?  Should I tell him this is a really hectic time in my life in my life and I don't have time???  I just dont know.  I just wish he didn't act so sure of himself.  That bugs me a lot.  &quot;this summer we're going to have to go to the beach alot&quot; or &quot;this summer I'll take you to play laser tag&quot;.  He made it sound like we were already a couple.  He did that the WHOLE night.  I guess its not really a big deal, but I don't know.  I guess I'll be praying long and hard tonight. <br>

*Brandon asked me out again for this weekend, but I just wanna stay home and veg out.  Except for my trip to the mall with Trace.  Yeah, friends above guys in my book.  Brandon...I don't know about him yet.  He is near me 24/7!  My friends are getting mad at me, and I know I need to talk to him, but he was on a trip with the Biology class today.  Everyone knows I went out with him this weekend.  My guy friend Andrew, who I'm in love with, knew about it.  But Brandon, he touches me alot.  Just real casual and friendly, but its constant and I'm tired of it.  This morning before school I was NOT in the mood to talk bc I was trying to study for a test 1st hour, but the boy doesn't have a clue.  I planned what I want to say to him, but I don't know when.  How does this sound?<br>
                Brandon, I have a lot of fun with you and I think you're really great.  I want to get to know you better; I want to be your friend.  That's why I think we should just take this really slow and get to know each other good before we get serious.  I want to be your friend before anything else.  Can we work on just going slowly and being friends?<br>
But when would I talk to him about this? He's by my locker bt classes but thats not alot of time, and I try to stay with my friends at lunch...maybe if he finds me before school, otherwise I'll go with bt 6th and 7th hours.  Whew, here's hoping this goes good.  I just need him to back off a little.
