Her large lips moved every once in a while with the words on the pages. Her laughter lighting up the air when she reached a part she particularly enjoyed. Causing the Horse to perk up his ears.<br>
<br>
Her horse &quot;Charlemagne&quot; moved his snout to nuzzle her foot in the stirrup. Keelinar absently held out her other hand to pet the large horses neck gently scratching his hide with her gloved fingertips never loosing her place or the confidence that Charlemagne wouldn't plunge them head first into a ditch.<br>

Qninde glanced up, surprised.  Most people never noticed him hiding behind trees... And when they did, they'd ignore him.<br>
<br>
He had been watching the woman on her horse for a few minutes.  He had never seen a horse.  Needless to say, it was quite a fascinating creature... A little big, though...<br>
<br>
Hair and eyes fading from a dull, surprised orange back to wary green, Qninde stepped cautiously around the trunk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xxshindxx>xx Shin D xx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/4/03 2:32 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.imgmag.com/images/insane_saint/Zechspic.jpg width=101 length=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quiet Time</span><hr size=1> OOC~ Animagess the who's there was intended for me and could your character stick to one place.

Keelinar leaned down and put her book in her saddle bag, keeping her eyes on the Man. After a brief moment she threw her leg over the side of the large beast and threw it's reins over its head so she could still keep hold of her mount.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sacred Knights eh? Aye, I know of them well. I am Keelinar the Dark daughter of Colin of Bourburough and Elsa Lady Mist, Sister of Charlinar the Fair, Knight of the Realm and Peer of Magic.&quot; <br>
<br>
She watched him lean against the large trunk of an ancient tree with her bright blue eyes.<br>
<br>
She wanders a bit closer to him. Still observing with her shrewd senses honed from years of training.<br>
<br>
&quot;You say you are wandering through here? Nick Gale of the Sacred Knights?&quot; She says his full title as a show of respect. <br>
&quot; You must let me extend hospitality to a fellow Knight brother for our Clans are brother clans and have helped each other many times.&quot; She extendsher leather gloved hand to him even as her other hand pushes back her long curly blonde hair. <br>

<br>
&quot;Come with me Nick, and tell me more of your journeys. Why have you gone far from home? For education? For Glory?&quot; <br>
<br>
The two walked side by side, she was happy enough to let him talk. Keelin was a rare warrior. A mix between Quiet and Shy, Deadly and Confident.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will of course stay at my lodging, and I can make a fine meal if I put my mind to it....&quot; Keelinar again smiled at Nick exposing her white teeth.

She led the elfin man to her modest house, two bedrooms, a living space and cook space and a few odd rooms here and there. Her furnature was hand carved and her pads and pillows for that furnature hand sewn silk in a mariad of colors.<br>
