<br>
I definitely believe there is intelligent life somewhere in the vast universe.  I find it quite egocentric to think otherwise.  Although, it does bring about numerous spiritual and religious questions.  For example, are they flawed (sinful) as well?  Did the ultimate sacrifice, such as the death of God's Son, have to occur for that species as well?  Could they have a separate god for their own galaxy (as I have heard some to think)?  Or is the God that Christians, Muslims, Jews, etc believe in the same in other galaxies?  <br>
<br>
I find the spiritual aspect to be one of the most fascinating to ponder if other intelligent life were to ever contact in some way our planet...   Certainly it would make all believers re-evaluate their conception of God.<br>

I am firmly accepting of life out there some place, but the probability of intelligent life is very minor.  Life as we understand it can exist (over simplification here) pretty much wherever there is liquid water.  Now, the universe is approx 15 billion years old.  Our planet (keep your pants on creationists) is approx 5 billion.  You can see we are not so very far away from the start of this whole schebang.  Now, most of the heavier elements like gold and others can only be formed in the heart of some of the densest and hottest burning stars, called a white dwarf.  So any complex organism that is dependant on the heavier elements (iron for example) could not have occurred in the earlier stages of our universes formation.  The material just wasn’t there.  Next, planets form around stars, they congeal from collected masses and form planets.  The material in this highly tumultuous environment settles out in the cooling stages and forms generally a fairly round body.  It is atypical to form any other shape than a sphere.  Gravity works towards uniformity and when you have a fairly uniform sphere and it is covered in liquid water, you have all the basics for life.  Teeming masses of life swarming all around.  However, what you don’t get are large open tracts of land, like we have here.  <br>
<br>
Our moon and the irregular shape of our planet are HUGE factors in being where we are today. Whatever impact clove the moon from our forming earth, or deformed the earth into its present shape can be attributed with setting the stage for us.   If we didn’t have sufficient arid land then there would never have been anything for our forebears to crawl out of the seas onto.  Without land, our physiology would have been constrained by our environment and performance within that environment, just like sharks and dolphins.  You don’t end up with an opposable thumb in the sea.  You also don’t have fires in the sea.  Fire is the next HUGE factor in technological development and the furtherance of intelligence.  Industry (including agriculture) requires tools and combustion to progress.  Intelligence requires the passing of information from generation to generation that the cumulative knowledge can be built upon.  Next, the gas giants in our solar system, Saturn and Jupiter, are less obvious benefactors to our existence.  They function as blockers for the larger space debris that comes hurtling in to our system from the depths of space.  The stuff inside our system will be in an orbital path much like all the planets are and would have stabilized and been established 4 billion years ago, but the big dangerous stuff has to get by the giants out there.  The few impacts we have seen were disastrous to the inhabitants of the times so the whole evolution curve getting reset all the time would prevent the uninterrupted passage of time for something like us to evolve.  <br>
<br>
Yes, it is inarguably likely that there is other life out there.  It is highly unlikely that there is intelligent life out there since 1) we came on the stage so early in the game, 2) the requirements are so unlikely, and 3) the evidence is against it.  However, that does not mean that more intelligent lives won’t emerge, just that it is unlikely to have happened yet.  It is arguably inevitable to happen, the only difficulty being how to find them when they do.<br>

nice post.  you have the ability to cram a ten page essay into just a few well chosen words.  it always gives me something to study further and to think about.<br>
<br>
i totally respect your skepticism yet still cling to my faith that the universe being infinite has way more then we can comprehend in our limited space.  why i try to define it in my own mind before it is discovered is a mystery to most atheists i'm sure.<br>
<br>
i think it has to do with following illogical feelings over and over again to a &quot;better&quot; state.  the problem with disproving faith is that it is acquired on an individual basis.<br>

Dag, you think I don’t imagine all the potentials out there?  I do.  I dream of the day we get to chart the evolution of another species foreign to our world.  Or better still, meet other races of atheists and share a joke over universal fundies.  The difference is that I don’t attribute more weight to my flights of fancy than I do to the comics in the Sunday paper.  They are enjoyable day dreaming, with some strong rational backing and healthy imagination, but I will not be beamed up any time soon.  Flights of fancy do not a definition make.  You can dwell on it all day, but until evidence and experiment validate it, they are just flights of fancy.  God is just one of the more persistant ones, that’s all.  If you release all that self-certainty from your explanations, say ‘imagine’ instead of ‘define’, and stick with what is supported by the evidence rather than your feelings, you’d be a pretty good skeptic.  Listen to your heart, certainly, but do not trust it blindly.<br>

<br>
&quot; the heart has its reasons which reason knows not of &quot;<br>
<br>
i can see my wife and kids and continue to feel the happiness that we all share.  i continue to trust that which makes me happiest.<br>
<br>
i left BYU right in the middle of a semester because of a feeling.  a strong persistent feeling to go get a job and a wife in seattle.  i was slapped by my girlfriend, laughed at by my roommates and even tried to tell myself that i was killing my future by dropping all my classes in the middle of the semester.  sure it could be that i ate bad tuna before praying in the temple but the feeling would not go away no matter how many times i tried to talk some sense into that senseless head of mine.<br>
<br>
my wife was a traveling photographer making really good money (in Utah of all places) and got the same feeling to move to the same place where we met a couple weeks later.  we were engaged 2 weeks after we met and were married 5 weeks later.  3 years, 2 kids and 1 job at microsoft later i can look back and see the goodness that came from doing the illogical thing.<br>
<br>
my wife turned out to be even better than the spirit said she was going to be.  i'm sure nobody will argue that 7 weeks is enough time to get to know someone you decide to spend the rest of your life with (let alone eternity).  this could only have happened had i learned how to feel and recognize the spirit.<br>
<br>
had i stayed at BYU i would have been looking for work during the dot com bust which is bad since my major was computer science.  following the spirit i was led to a job at microsoft during the whole fruition of the dot com era.  they paid for my tuition at UW and i have been working at microsoft ever since.<br>
<br>
i don't expect everyone to understand how to distinguish between personal feelings and spiritual guidance but the more i follow the spirit, the easier it is to recognize it.<br>
<br>
i still feel like i am able to access all the truth that a skeptic can, as well as truth that can only be accessed via faith and personal revelation.  why limit myself to only one method for acquiring truth when i have found another that works?<br>
<br>
although i am not led to do something totally illogical very often, i continue to pray, meditate and try to receive guidance from the spirit.  i cannot do this for someone else, and someone else cannot if they will not.  testimonies are acquired on an individual basis.<br>
<br>
