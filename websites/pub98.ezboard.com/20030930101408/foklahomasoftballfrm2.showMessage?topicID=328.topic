I didn't get to see much of the men's tournament since they had us playing all over creation.<br>
<br>
Legendz was relaxing in the shade waiting to play the finals when I headed home. Hopefully they pulled one out to get the title. Damn Sandbaggers. lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  CString will probably let us know how they finished up.<br>
<br>
Team Cooper (Bville) was alive in the Upper division on Sunday. I don't know anyone off that team to even know if they check this board. Hopefully they will find it soon. <br>
<br>
Our Sunday was eventful. We played Aftershock (#2 C in the country) again at 7 am Sunday &amp; run-ruled them. Then we beat a B team playing as a C (Snappers). Ray's was the same thing, a B team playing as C. They told us before the game they told the tournament directors they were a B team &amp; they would not let them play B. Weird. We had them on the ropes the whole game anyway. We almost had them run-ruled early, then they were down 5 (I think) going into the bottom of the last inning...tied it at 13-13 with a grand slam and won it a few batters later with a single.<br>
<br>
I'm sure Sidewinders/Rock Chalk ended up winning the thing. They were Danny Manning's paid team. As in not only all expenses, but money for playing from what I heard. Must be nice. As an A team, their HR advantage was big. Their men played up as AA that weekend &amp; I believe won the upper division. There was a little something fishy about them being in the mixed bracket. That would put Rays (B) in second &amp; and us in third.<br>
<br>
Punchinjudy, the stats for this weekend are sealed in a vault somewhere. I made a run at you Sunday, but I'm sure you were the man this weekend...now if you would just quit opening up the middle against those B teams. lol <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cstring84@oklahomasoftball>cstring84</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#8B0000>(6/16/03 6:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=328.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Great job Tulsa!!</span><hr size=1> That is the way to represent Tulsa!!

I think I know one of the guys on Dual County (if he used to play coed for Undercliff). That looked like a solid team also. <br>
<br>
Pete's Inn was another Miken team, so we did our part for the company even though the rules somehow allowed no Miken's at all...not even the legal ones.

Great job this weekend! I started to look you guys up on Sunday but I was in &quot;game mode&quot; lol since we were in the loser's bracket and also didn't know if anyone in the upper division would want to bother to talk to a little ole mixed player. lol<br>
<br>
I'm supposed to call today about the new bats. We'll see. If you see my post further down the board, I was told the Edge isn't even in production yet and HASN'T been tested by any association. That tells me it might be a while. I'd take some V2s though to tide the gap.<br>
<br>
The rules on the Mikens changed on every field this weekend. Some wouldn't allow any (the official tournament stance), some were allowing Velocit-Es &amp; we played one that allowed the U2. I had to check twice to make sure and then have her ask another ump before I used it, but she let us use the U2. It was a 250 foot fence that game, so there wasn't much need for it actually. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tpsman15>tpsman15</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8B0000>(6/16/03 8:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=328.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   BatPimp</span><hr size=1> Man I love meeting new people, I don't see people by the class of softball they play, and I had several come up and introduce themselves this weekend.

Well, he had a couple of games off and hammered way too much booze. He couldn't walk straight. His speech was slurred. <br>
<br>
Then he decides he'll hop in his ole Blue Ford pickup (around a '78 model tank without much of a muffler) and drive somewhere. After several near misses by the field of hitting things, he makes it down the street and promptly overruns his first turn. We were hoping he wouldn't come back. <br>
<br>
We drove to the store to get some water between games and he was sitting in the middle of the intersection by the store. He had missed his turn and I guess couldn't figure out what to do. He eventually went on down another block and turned.<br>
<br>
About thirty minutes after we get back from the store, he makes it back to the park, his driver's side bumper is mangled where he's hit something. He has a few more beers with a team and decides its time to leave again. There are two or three teams watching him at this point. <br>
<br>
He has a standard transmission, so he's gunning his engine just to move it a foot because he's too saused to work the clutch. He manages to miss the SUV behind his truck, but he pulls forward and hits a support cord for all the power lines by the parks. All the poles/wires shake. We thought they were coming down. He still wants to leave. <br>
<br>
Some guy ends up grabbing him and &quot;removing&quot; him and his keys from the truck just before the local cop shows up. I guess the first guy is a cop, because the local guy gives him his cuffs and they slap him in the back of the car. They come back later to take pictures of the bumper and lock up the truck.<br>
<br>
I heard he didn't even get a DUI, which is a miracle. No way that guy should have been back on the road Sunday. I'd bet a beer he was back looking for more free beer. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=batpimp>BatPimp</A> at: 6/16/03 5:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C0D9D9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> punchinjudy</span><br> <span class=usertitle>I need to register</span><br>   <font color=#8B0000>(6/17/03 2:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=328.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   red</span><hr size=1> Ya,  I think that red got more hits in one ten minute period than a couple of our men did during the whole tourney.
