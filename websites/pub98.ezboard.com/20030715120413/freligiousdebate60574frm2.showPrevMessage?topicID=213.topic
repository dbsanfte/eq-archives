Actually i'm going to be off line for some time starting tomorrow. We have to get our son looked at again back in the states and are not sure whether they will have to do surgery again nor not. And no matter what happens the kiddos and I are staying in the states for another month at least.<br>
<br>
So I'll be gone for about 2 months at bare minimum. I hope this board continues to stay here though. I've enjoyed the debates.<br>

So just in case I miss anything in the next several months of hiatus, you can refer here for my points of view:<br>
<br>
Circumcision is a FINE choice - end of discussion<br>
<br>
Abortion is often used as an easy way to ditch responsiblity for the consequences of ones actions - you always have a choice.. sex or no sex, if you CHOOSE sex and you get a baby, then it is not JUST your body anymore.  You have involved another life and YOU have no right to end that life no matter how inconvenient it is for you.  ( just as euthanasia would be wrong especially if your choice was based on your own personal convenience and you didnt want to be burdened with the caregiving responsibility)  If life ends when brain activity ceases, WHY is there any debate that it begins when brain activity begins?<br>
<br>
There is spiritual truth and proof and those who have received it know and those who haven't continue to argue that you can't prove God exists.  Simple and yet lost on so many intelligent people.  Oh and with the premise that this life is the only place we can develop faith, it would really contra-indicate the purpose of life if God was popping through the clouds all the time saying yoohoo, here I am, yep go ahead and believe.<br>
<br>
Pure religion and pure science will all fall together someday and many people will be very suprised.<br>
<br>
Proselyting is NOT a violation of your rights, nor a sign of disrespect.  That politically correct, everyone's truth is right philosophy is just nonsense.  Everyone has a right to believe what they will, but it does not mean I have to accept your truth as valid to the point that I dont share my faith with you, if you choose to listen.  When the world was proven round, do you think that the idea the world was flat was just accepted as an alternative POV, and heaven forbid we should disrespect those who continued to believe the world was flat by sharing with them the truth.<br>
<br>
I think its great that all sorts of churches and secular non profit groups are providing aid to struggling peoples and nations.  I dont think that help should be conditional.  But there is no harm in offering the gospel as well.<br>
<br>
Lets see did I miss anything?<br>
<br>
Oh and just for you DL feel free to edit my compound sentences, my dangling participles, the spelling errors, and whatever little tidbits you can't pass up.  You know I almost feel a sense of pride in the fact that I have gotten under your skin to the point that you loose your ability to debate with logic and reason.   Hmm makes ya wonder why it is that you are so distracted by me.<br>

Not my soapbox, so I will leave it to those who feel the passion over it.

<br>

If as you say life ends when brain activity ends, then why is it then not acceptable to abort prior to brain activity beginning?  Why not a simpler model, life exists when it can support itself.  If at 32 weeks the baby is viable, it has a life and subsequent rights, if it cannot exist outside the womb, then it is a parasite.  Kind of like some of these religious institutions on our gov’t funding now.  Now, let’s look at just how “easy” abortion is as a means of “ditching” responsibility.  Major medical procedures in latter stages, presumption on your part to know oh so very many abortant mothers, and no single statistical basis for your argument.  The fact is, women who choose abortion do not enter into it lightly.  There is no “often” as you claim it.  The case you claim, in all my years working in hospitals in direct support of the surgical units, has never been witnessed where a Dynamo went for a tumble unprotected and came up knockers and just went in for a weekend vac-u-suck to tidy things up and toddled off to tumble someone else giggling all the while.  That just doesn’t happen.  Why am I not surprised you oppose euthinasia?  Oh, because that is a selfish and presumptuous position to take.  NM.  (BTW it is responsibility not responsibility, didn’t has an apostrophe and care-giving is hyphenated.) <br>

You have PROOF?  Well let's see it!  Roll it out so we can all be saved!  I'm sorry, this is a &quot;I know it when I see it&quot; thing?  Oh, well that isn't so much proof then as self delusion.  Best part, “Simple and yet lost on so many intelligent people.” because the idiots all swallow it hook line and sinker.  How about the premise that god wrote all the laws of nature, set the universe in motion, and still needs to whisper in yer prophets ear to get you to behave?  What’s the point?  ANY involvement AT ALL by god would invalidate your hypothesis just as much as god “popping through the clouds all the time saying yoohoo, here I am, yep go ahead and believe!”  Do you not see how you undermine each and every one of your arguments within their statements themselves? JS the fraud is screwing you to this day, and you BRAG about it!  This is why the Deist position of god did it, and doesn’t interfere is so much more palatable.  Your bible is a lie.  How can god create such a diverse, glorious and intricately intertwined creation and so totally fuck up the editing of a simple book?  Please.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Pure religion and pure science will all fall together someday and many people will be very suprised. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yup, when religion continuously revises itself out of existence and inevitably falls beneath the crushing weight of TRUTH.  Every day it becomes a little less crappy and more acceptable.  One day it will be irrelevant totally.  Won’t that be a “suprise”.<br>
<br>

They held as doctrinally correct and biblically inerrant the flatness of the world.  You may be free to speak in public, but my front porch ain’t public lady.  So get the hell off it when I close my door and tell you I don’t want yer freekin flyers.  There is no requirement because you are free to speak that we be forced to listen.  ANY forum where attendance is compulsory ceases to be a public forum for your freedom to speak because it is violative of the individual’s rights to not have to listen.  This includes congressional sessions, public school athletic events, fire-drill gatherings, and the line at the unemployment office.  Proselytizing may not be a sign of disrespect, not shutting up when people are clear that they aren’t interested very definitely IS disrespectful.  WTF is Proselyting anyway?  Is that like Prose lite?  A third less filling than your regular prose? Or is that a Freudian slip and you meant to say Prose-lying?  Or do you mean Proselytizing?  Anyone who has been here any length of time at all knows you cannot pass up any opportunity you find.  Any question of &quot;why&quot; you reply to with 9 pages of &quot;This is what we believe&quot; and never actually say the short, simple why.  Try this one on, you are correct, everyone’s beliefs are not equally valid.  While they all have a right to believe whatever they choose, that does not make what they choose to believe right.  You can choose to believe that a punch in the eye from your husband is a sign of love and only happens because you are inadequate; you can choose to believe that smoking doesn’t hurt anyone; you can choose to believe that evolution doesn’t happen; you can believe anything you want.  But TRUTH is supported by evidence, fact and reality.  I choose to live in reality with the greatest degree of truth I can possibly find.  That makes my beliefs a hell of a lot more worthwhile and strong than yours.  I can back my position with facts and evidence and relax in the comfort and security of not deceiving myself or others.<br>
