Which is why I asked the question right here in the first place rather than &quot;going with my feelings&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> I have reason to believe based on past experience just this weekend that his beliefs run contrary to LDS doctrine or are absolutely not supported by it so had good cause to think he was making more wild claims that other LDS would not agree with. He DID say he was taught this though which, again, gave me reason to ask who and where. I am sorry he did not personally answer, but if you want to speak for him, you are close enough to probably know what he would say anyway.<br>
<br>
Also---it is not unreasonable to assume that when a person claims s/he is of such and such faith and comes to a religious debate board s/he is arguing from the doctrine of that faith. I have seen those who are baptist argue here and have their beliefs generalized...same with Catholics, but if you want to differentiate dag and say his beliefs are totally separate from his religion (a curious argument considering the one made to me in the pledge thread about theists not being able to separate themselves and their decisions from their god) then I will take your word for it. You would know best after all.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If so, one could theoretically sail from the west to get to the east. Only the distance was disputed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>At the end of the fifteenth century, celestial navigation was just being developed in Europe, primarily by the Portuguese. Prior to the development of celestial navigation, sailors navigated by &quot;deduced&quot; (or &quot;dead&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  reckoning, hereafter called DR. This was the method used by Columbus and most other sailors of his era. In DR, the navigator finds his position by measuring the course and distance he has sailed from some known point. Starting from a known point, such as a port, the navigator measures out his course and distance from that point on a chart, pricking the chart with a pin to mark the new position. Each day's ending position would be the starting point for the next day's course-and-distance measurement.<br>
<br>
In order for this method to work, the navigator needs a way to measure his course, and a way to measure the distance sailed. Course was measured by a magnetic compass, which had been known in Europe since at least 1183. Distance was determined by a time and speed calculation: the navigator multiplied the speed of the vessel (in miles per hour) by the time traveled to get the distance.<br>
<br>
In Columbus's day, the ship's speed was measured by throwing a piece of flotsam over the side of the ship. There were two marks on the ship's rail a measured distance apart. When the flotsam passed the forward mark, the pilot would start a quick chant, and when it passed the aft mark, the pilot would stop chanting. (The exact words to such a chant are part of a lost oral tradition of medieval navigation).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kcsqd2000>kcsqd2000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/5/03 10:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: C.

It was heresy, excomunicable at least, executionable at worst.  Yet that supression STILL couldn't overcome the truth of the world being round.  Chris had available evidence, testable facts and reproducable experiments, while the church only had threats, lies and dogma.  Guess who won?<br>
<br>
Now the mystery to me is why you are continuing to pretend that the difference between feeling and fact are escaping you.  We have lead you to water but we can't make you think.  His knowledge was based on fact because the horizon was curved, as a sailor he knew you saw the tip of a mast before you saw the rest of a ship, that shadows at differing merridians on the same day and time of the year were angled differently, a long weighted pendulum swung from a tower would oscilate rather than swing perfectly straight due to the rotation of the globe.  There was OVERWHELMING evidence that the world is round.  We now have satalite photos, and yet some people still don't believe it TODAY!<br>
<br>
This was FACT.  Feelings do not enter into it.  Feelings would be if he was nervous when he set sail, did he despair after 4 weeks, did he miss his son...not &quot;is the world round?&quot;.<br>

Back in Columbus's time, many people knew the world was round. They were the rich and educated. The people who thought the world was flat were the poor folk who didn't know any better. (Pythagoras was probably the first to hypothesize that the earth was round, but Eratosthenes measured the circumference of the earth from the top of the Great Pyramid of Giza at around 200BCE <br>
