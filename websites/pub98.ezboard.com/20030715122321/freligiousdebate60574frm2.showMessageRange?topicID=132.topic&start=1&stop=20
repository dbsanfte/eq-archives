What I mean by that is does god have guidelines about spanking, moms staying home ect.<br>
I know the bible does talk about this I want to know how you interpret it today.<br>

 Do you think that parents either religious or not do their children an injustice by not doing what you think god has said about parenting?<br>

So, I woud say yes, we parent using that knowledge.<br>
<br>
We have a proclamation on the family and this is some of what it says regarding parenting:<br>
<br>
&quot;Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for eachother and for their children. &quot;Children are an heritage unto the Lord&quot; (Psalms 127:3) Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them love and to serve one another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives-mothers and fathers-will be held accountale before God for the discharge of these obligations.&quot;<br>
<br>
The church has spoken out strongly about how we are to love our children and care for them, never to abuse them. How the Lord loves children so much. I often think about how Jesus said to bring the little children unto him and he held them and blessed them. That's how we are to treat them.<br>
<br>
The church is not pro-spanking either. <p>Paige<br>

<br>
We need scripture to tell us this?  Damn, and all this time I've just been relying on common sense.  I'm such a heathen.<br>
<br>
I knew a lot of Mormons growing up.  One of my best friends was Mormon, and her mom was always pushing stuff from the church off onto my mom.  Not Jesus stuff, but showing her brochures from the church about how to take time to cook with her daughter, sew with her daughter, talk to her daughter, etc.  My mom's response to her was always &quot;I do these things anyway&quot;.  Don't get me wrong, I think it is nice to promote family relations in any way possible, but if someone can't do any of this stuff on their own without their church telling them, then maybe they shouldn't have become parents in the first place because they don't have any of the natural tendencies to do right by their family.  I also had to crack up one night because my mom brought over dinnrer for one of our neighbors and his kids.  Why was this family sitting there without any dinner?  Because the mother was off at the Mormon church at a class on how to do stuff for your family.  Anyone else see the irony here?  <br>
<br>
I would also like to add that people don't just rely on traditional religious institutions to tell them how to raise their kids.  In some of my Franklin Covey literature I read how we should schedule time in our dayplanner for our family.  Sorry, but my husband and child are more than something to fill a time slot in my day planner.  I don't schedule time to be with them, I schedule time to get other things done around my family time, not the other way around.  Nobody needs to tell me how important my guys are.  That is something I know deep down, and no bible can penetrate that.  <br>
<br>
As for circumcision, I don't know.  I had my son circed, but it had nothing to do with religion.  I didn't have a bris, and it was a doctor who performed the circ.  If I was against circ, then there is no way I would have gone through with it, and I wouldn't care if my Jewish relatives got their panties in a bunch.  Heck, I haven't done any Jewish rituals, and they aren't bitching at me, so I guess I'm lucky in that sense.  I think that eventhough some of my relatives are more observant, they recognize that personal preference takes precedence over what gets dictated by religion.  <br>

It plays havoc with breastfeeding of course.<br>
<br>
One of my Catholic friends is very vocal against GKGW. She says, &quot;Can you just imagine Mother Mary looking at her watch and saying 'No Baby Jesus, I can't nurse you for another 20 minutes.':&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I know someone who does this program. Of course, she didn't want to breastfeed anyway because it was too &quot;sexual.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  She has little Stepford children. They are so &quot;good&quot; because they don't trust their parents enough to misbehave in front of them. They're motivated by fear. It's really sad. On the younger one's first birthday, the mom was spoon-feeding her cake because she didn't want to allow her to make a mess. Then it was &quot;her nap time&quot; and of course the little one didn't want to nap what with so many guests in the house. But the mom put her in a crib and then stood at the bottom of the stairs with her arms folded across her chest defiantly as the little one screamed away upstairs. It made me ill.<br>
<br>
Ha, then she was bragging that she'd never &quot;heated a bottle.&quot; She always gives them cold -doesn't want to trouble herself. (I wonder if she eats her dinner cold?) Then I realized I'd never heated a bottle either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . But I kept my mouth shut.<br>
<br>
Now I gotta say, before we get any controversy going: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I don't care</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> if other people want to bottlefeed. It's none of my business!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Heck, I was bottlefed and... wait, maybe that's not such a great example.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But I will have to say that I cringe in side when I hear religious parents talking about teaching their children to submit and to obey and be obediant. And how spankings are used to emphasize this. <br>
<br>
Now I've used spankings with DD in the past and might in the future but its not to make her submit. Or even be an obediant child. <br>
<br>
But the idea of spanking a child, especially a girl, to force submission seems to me a very dangerous mind set to be teaching a child. I believe it sets up a child to be used later on in life. If submission through spanking/hitting is what they know of love, then how will they stand against a husband who does the same thing? <br>

That thought frightens me to no end that parents would use discipline as a mode to teach submission.<br>
<br>
I think that the parent's role as set forth by God includes the common sense things that all parents, as parents, should be responsible for.  What Christian parents are responsible for though is to &quot;bring them up in the training and admonition of the Lord&quot;. <br>

There are certain things that parents do that I find disturbing. Would I point them no not unless they were hurting the kid.<br>
<br>
I have spanked my oldest and to tell you the truth I am ashamed of each and every time I have. I can remember each time I have and still have guilt over it. To me they weren’t spankings (not like what I got when I was kid) just a couple of swats on a diapered bum. For me to get to that point it means I am extremely pissed off and it shames me that I didn’t have more control and think of a better way to deal with the situation. I think there are parents out there that can &quot;spank&quot; and have control and not have it be a negative thing. I think you should never be angry when you hit a child. So for me it is a bad thing. <br>
<br>
As for being a SAHM I do it because that is what I think is right for my family. To be honest it has been an extremely hard transition for me and if I didn’t feel strongly on the subject I don’t think I would be able to make it. I do feel that if you can afford it and will not kill someone then one parent should be at home. I am not saying that working parents are wrong so lets not go there. I know that it is not right for everyone, but I also think having kids is an exercise in sacrifice. I really think I do the most important job there is.<br>
<br>
In general I would never teach my kids submission to anything. I think kids are people not little science projects for me to mould. I think they should be respectful of people in general not because they are older or a man. I want my kids to question everything and think for themselves even if that means something I don’t agree with. I think if we listen kids have the most to teach us about everything. I think our jaded grown-up BS gets in the way of enjoying life and their simple sweet little minds are the best medicine for that.<br>
<br>
Ok I am going to get off my soapbox no<br>

Dh grew up in an abusive household and was completely against ANY kind of hitting when it came to disciplining ds. I'd like to know where in the bible it states you MUST use force on a child to make him/her obey. Don't get me wrong, I was spanked as a child and I turned out fine (I think...), I'm talking about excessive hitting, abuse etc...<br>
<br>
If you look at Jesus, he was a kind, gentle man and was able to get his point across without smacking around the disciples, so I don't understand why some Christian sects promote fear-based discipline.<br>
<br>
I know only a handful of moms who spank and their kids seem fine. I would never tell them they're wrong, who's to say I'm exactly right with my form of discipline? To each his own, I guess.  Its the parents who go overboard with the hitting that really get me going.<br>

My 2 older kids were raised when I was in a baptist, born again church, for a few years. They were raised to do good things and live to please god and god sees all and, you need to be good because god knows and sees all. Then I realized it was a load of crap and I realized it wasnt fair to my kids to make them believe the way I was made to.  I feel so guilty for that. My younger children are going to grow up to learn that it is just the right way to live, to be honest, kind, caring, compassionate, tolerant and accepting of others because it is the right way to live.Not because it should be pleasing to the bibles definition of how a child should be raised in the ways of the lord. My older kids are old enough that I can explain to them that I was wrong in my choices and that they need to be the ones to make the choice for themselves what they want to believe.  I have let them know that Wicca, Pagans, Athiest, arent people to be afraid of, they way I was taught and that other religions, LDS,  Lutherans, even born agains all havae aritgh to there beliefs. BUt to force god on them  based on fear is not right. spare the rod and spoil the child. that ezzo is an idiot.<br>
I think of the fear I was raised with and still wonder if maybe they wer right and I am wrong and will go to hell one day. My head says no way and I know that is not how it is. But i think it is kind of sad that I even have to think this way and I sure dont want my kids to grow up to feel this way. I want them to be free of all religious dogma and be free and happy with their choices.<br>

Let's take the work vs stay home debate for example.  I'm a working mom.  I have to work to pay bills, but I am content with being a working mom (at least when I get to work part-time).  I totally respect the decision to stay home eventhough I'm not sure if I would be cut out to do it.  I understand that parents stay home for various reasons.  I don't think they are judging when they merely state those reasons.  The judgement comes in when someone starts with the &quot;everyone can stay home if they wanted to&quot;, or &quot;cut back on the luxuries&quot;, or &quot;you should have just bought a dog&quot;, or &quot;someone else is raising your child&quot;.  Those comments are an example of judgement, but I don't feel that someone is judging if they decide for themself that staying home is the best option.  Same goes for the breastfeeding debate.  I breastfed, and I had my reasons for doing it.  I still don't knock formula feeders, and I was formula fed as a baby and turned out just fine.  I expressed my decision in my own mind on whether to breastfeed or not, but just because I had specific reasons, that doesn't necessarily mean I think the other choice is wrong.  I hope I'm making sense.<br>
<br>
When it comes to the &quot;spare the rod&quot; statement, there is a ton of debate around that over what it really means.  Like most things in the bible, the passage isn't very clear or concise.  Everyone has an opinion on what they think it means.  This is why I think common sense needs to prevail.  If you are against spanking, then don't do it.  If you are for spanking, then do what you feel you need to do.  If you choose not to spank, then you need to find alternate methods of discipline that are effective.  If you choose to spank, then you need to do it without abusing the child.  If your child is running amok because they aren't disciplined, or if your child has bruises all over them from too much discipline, then yeah, I suppose I'll judge you in the sense that I will acknowledge the parenting behavior is wrong.  I spank my child, but it isn't very often I do it, I do it as a last resort, and I don't do anything to hurt him.  It is usually one of those little hand tap deals, and once or twice I've done a light spanking on the diaper bottom.  Since I don't do it that often, he knows that I mean business when it does get done, and I can get by with doing it lightly because the mere incident of a spanking drives home the point that he is in trouble without me needing to hurt him.  The bible doesn't get into these details.  This is why a parent needs to put down their bible and think these things through.  Merely referring to the &quot;rod&quot; doesn't break down the punishment process for anyone, and when I think of a &quot;rod&quot;, I think of something horribly abusive (or something dirty, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  I think that as long as your parenting methods aren't harming the child or causing them to wreak havoc on society, then the only judge in the parenting matter should be yourself.  <br>
<br>
BTW, from what I've read about Ezzo, the guys sounds like a nutcase.  I don't have the most liberal parenting methods in the world, but come on.  That guy sounds downright mean.  If my son is hungry off of schedule, then I'm going to feed him.  Do adults eat at the exact same time everyday?  Nooooooo.  Do we have days where our appetites are sometimes bigger than other day?  Yeeeeesssss.  Does someone need to lock Ezzo in a room and dictate when he gets to eat and sleep down to the millisecond?  Yeeeeesssss.<br>

Actually, a very many people do this BECAUSE of the bible. There was a big law suit last year with a congregation in the south where the minister beat the kids himself if the parents couldn't. Biblical calls to violence include children and people who take it literally would have to follow god's laws...I'm thinking back to the circumcision debate...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>if it was god's will to punish your children at every moment...would you?? i can pretty much say all of you would say NO....<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, in the circ debate (and outside of it) many parents do indeed put the baby boys in great paind and at great risk for infection by cutting off part of their penis to please god. There may be others who give alternative reasons, but there are PLENTY who circ girls and boys in the world today for no good reason other than to please the demented commands of a deity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and if so....why would u need a book to tell you how to be good parents???<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
But don't those who follow the bible do so to find out how to be good everything...wives, parents, servants to god, neighbors, etc. Seems silly to have to refer to a book (bible in particular) to freethinkers, but to someone who looks to it for everything else, parenting wouldn't be any different.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>whats the difference if things were vice versa about the bible and god?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Not sure what you mean here, but as with submission, circing, etc. those who follow the bible must follow the bible. I can see the argument against picking and choosing which parts of god's commandments and guidelines you find appealing and discarding what you don't like. Perhaps if more people who claimed to be religious or spiritual (in the judeo-xian theisms) actually READ and studied the bible we'd have more folks thinking for themselves and choosing reason over superstition as a guiding force in their lives all the way around and looking in more than one place for the answers.<br>
