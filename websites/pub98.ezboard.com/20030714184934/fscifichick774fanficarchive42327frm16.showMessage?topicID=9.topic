Story # 7:  Motherly Love - Chapter 1<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“I see,” Chloe said coolly, sucking in a deep breath to calm her nerves.  “Should I even ask?”  Lex noticed her tone of voice and instinctually wrapped his arm around her.  <br>
<br>
“We can talk about it when we get home,” Gabe said, turning to face his daughter. <br>
<br>
“About that,” Lionel started, taking a few steps forward while giving his son a half-knowing, half-disapproving look, “When will you two *really* be getting married?”  Lex stared at him blankly for a second and then pursed his lips.<br>
<br>
“I take it you’ve spoken with Mr. ---”<br>
<br>
“Mxyzptlk,” Lionel interrupted and gave a small wave of his hand.<br>
<br>
“No fair.  How come he can pronounce his name and we can’t?” Chloe whispered to Lex.  Lex grinned and his father completely ignored what Chloe had said.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” Lionel continued, “Quite an interesting fellow, but not the answer to the question I asked you.”  Chloe opened her mouth to speak, but her dad beat her to it.<br>
<br>
“If I get a vote, I think it should be soon,” Gabe said, folding his arms across his chest as he spoke to Lionel.  Chloe and Lex’s eyes both widened in surprise, but Lionel gave him a small smirk and a curt nod of his head.<br>
<br>
“I agree,” he said.  “Glad to see we’re of like-mind, Mr. Sullivan.”<br>
<br>
“What?  You can’t just ---” Chloe was ripped away from her objection by Gabe’s hand on her arm.  He forced a grin at Lex as he pulled Chloe away from him.<br>
<br>
“Your *mother* called,” Gabe said in a hissed whisper, his eyes darting toward Lex and Lionel to make sure they couldn’t hear him.  “And unless you want to give up whatever dreams you may have had for your life so you can go live with her, then you *need* to get married.  It’s the only way, Chloe.”  Chloe frowned and ran a hand through her hair.<br>
<br>
“I don’t understand,” she replied.  “Why now?  Why is she doing this now?”  Gabe looked at her sympathetically, his hands resting on her upper arms.<br>
<br>
“Sweetheart, you know the rules – so did she, and she broke them.  Forcing her to live without her daughter was her punishment.”<br>
<br>
“So, why now?” Chloe repeated.  Gabe shook his head a little.<br>
<br>
“She said something about the council deciding that she had been punished long enough,” he said quietly and then gave her a wry grin.  “And I’m sure it has something to do with the fact that you were suddenly able to hurt Clark.”  Chloe grumbled.<br>
<br>
Lionel and Lex looked over to where Gabe and his daughter were huddled and speaking in hushed voices.<br>
<br>
“I like her,” Lionel mused aloud.  “Apart from being beautiful and intelligent, she’s also got fire and determination.”  He allowed himself a small chuckle.  “*And* she hurt was able to hurt Martha Kent’s son.  She’s obviously meant to be a Luthor.”  He noticed the way Chloe seemed to be getting more and more upset with the conversation she and Gabe were having.  “What do you suppose *that’s* about?” <br>
<br>
“I have a feeling it has something to do with her mom,” Lex finally commented. <br>
<br>
“Hmm,” Lionel said pensively.  “She won’t be a problem, will she?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” Lex responded honestly.  “Chloe hasn’t ever talked about her.”  <br>
<br>
“And Clark?”<br>
<br>
“What about him?”<br>
<br>
“He seemed rather set against the idea of you two getting married – and I know what good friends you are,” Lionel pointed out, his voice lined with innuendo as he raised a suspicious eyebrow.  “Anything you want to tell me, Lex?”  Lex kept staring at Chloe and her dad, his hands clenching into fists at the mention of Clark’s name, but not for the reason Lionel was implying.<br>
<br>
“She used to be in love with him.”<br>
<br>
Both of Lionel’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
Lex turned his head toward his father with a growl.  The bad feeling that grew in his gut when he first heard that Chloe’s mom called had tripled with the animated conversation Chloe and Gabe were having along with his father mentioning the man that Chloe used to think she was in love with.<br>
<br>
“What part didn’t you understand?” Lex asked through gritted teeth.  “She – was – in – love – with - *him*.”  He spoke slowly and annunciated every angry word, causing his father’s surprised expression to fall to a somewhat bemused one.<br>
<br>
“*Was*,” Lionel reminded him gently, before Lex took his aggression out on him.  Lex took a deep breath and tried to relax his body as he nodded once.<br>
<br>
“Was,” he agreed.  <br>
<br>
“She can’t make me move there!” Chloe yelled, bringing Lex and Lionel’s attention back to her.  Gabe was trying to calm her down with whispered words, but was apparently failing.  <br>
<br>
“And here I thought Mr. Sullivan was anxious for his daughter to marry you because of our family’s money,” Lionel mused, more to himself than to Lex.  Before Lex could respond, Lionel continued.  “But apparently it’s to keep her away from her mother.  You’re sure Chloe’s never mentioned her?”  Lex nodded.  “Yes, well, little does the former Mrs. Sullivan know that problems such as herself can be easily taken care of.”  <br>
<br>
Lex turned to look at his dad as he heard the familiar tones of cell phone buttons being pushed.<br>
<br>
“You can’t ‘take care of’ her, Dad.  Chloe might not be on the best of terms with her, but she’d never forgive me.”<br>
<br>
“My, but you do like to jump to conclusions, don’t you?” Lionel asked with a smirk on his lips.  Upon hearing someone answer on the other line, his attention went to them instead of to his son.  “Yes; I have an assignment for you.”<br>
<br>
“Dad,” Lex said warningly.  Lionel continued to ignore him, speaking only into the cell phone pressed against his ear.<br>
<br>
“I need you to find the best wedding planner in the area and bring them to Smallville --- don’t be absurd, Lex is the one getting married --- alright, thank you.”  He clicked off his phone and placed it back in his jacket pocket, smugly grinning at the not quite relieved expression on Lex’s face.<br>
<br>
“Now who’s jumping to conclusions?” Lex asked.  “I haven’t even asked her to marry me yet – and there’s always the possibility that ---”<br>
<br>
“Lex, Lex, Lex,” Lionel chided mockingly, tsking with his tongue.  “She’s not going to say no.”<br>
<br>
“She hasn’t graduated yet, she ---”<br>
<br>
“She’s going to be shipped off to God knows where if she doesn’t marry you,” Lionel interrupted.  “And I’ve seen the way she looks at you – and at my future granddaughter…she’s not going to say no.”<br>
<br>
“There’s got to be another way,” Chloe said insistently, breaking whatever bonding moment had been occurring between the two Luthor men.  One corner of Lionel’s mouth lifted up and he forced himself to hold back a chuckle.<br>
<br>
“Of course, I could be wrong,” he told Lex, the mirth coming through in his statement.  “No matter,” he said confidently, “I’m sure you’ll find a way to convince her.”  Lex glanced at his dad, recognizing the warning tone in his voice.  His face held no hint of emotion, but he was inwardly surprised that he and his father had finally found something they agreed on.  <br>
<br>
Chloe walked over to him, wiping away the tears that had fallen onto her cheeks with her hand.  <br>
<br>
“I – um – I have to go,” she said in a choked voice, trying to keep herself from crying again.  “I’ll talk to you later, okay?”  She gave him a sad look and began to turn around to leave with her dad.  Lex reached out and grabbed her arm, swinging her back around to face him.  He cupped her face with his hands and leaned down swiftly to kiss her.  He could taste the salty warmth as her fresh tears dripped down her face and onto their lips, sliding into their mouths as their tongues moved together.  When they finally pulled back to breathe, they pulled each other into a tight hug, Chloe burying her face against his chest.  “I ---”<br>
<br>
“I won’t let her take you away from me,” Lex said, one of his hands stroking the hair on the back of her head soothingly.  She pulled away and gave him a meager grin.<br>
<br>
“It might not be up to you,” she said.  “But I appreciate the thought.”  Lex nodded and allowed her to slip out of his arms, their hands running down their extended arms for one last lingering touch before she left.<br>
<br>
Lex watched Chloe walk with her dad to his car and clenched his jaw.  Lionel stepped up beside him, observing the scene as well.  Both sets of eyes focused on the departing Sullivans, Lionel spoke in an entirely too measured voice.<br>
<br>
“Would you like me to make that second phone call now?”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Clark drove along one of the old roads almost absently; his mind on other matters besides his driving.  Lana and Pete were gone – really gone, or so it seemed; and yet he couldn’t escape his thoughts of how Chloe had been able to hurt him.  Surely he would have remembered having some of his powers transferred to her, and he knew that didn’t happen.  He shook his head and gripped the wheel tighter.  Maybe he wasn’t the only one in Smallville hiding something.  What was to say that another family from Krypton didn’t send their child there and his biological parents just didn’t know about it?  <br>
<br>
The second ship could have easily been hidden in the same meteor storm and it would certainly explain why Chloe was so attracted to anything having to do with the meteor rocks.  But she didn’t have the same adverse reaction to them that he did.<br>
<br>
‘Maybe girls are different,’ he thought to himself.  ‘Maybe she’s just coming into her powers but doesn’t have the same weaknesses I do – maybe I react that way around them because of some allergy or something.’  He frowned.  “Geez, that would suck.”<br>
<br>
Clark sighed when he remembered that Chloe was originally from Metropolis, which pretty much discounted his theory, but still didn’t explain why Chloe had been able to hurt him.  Of course, Chloe had never told him where she was born; and if she wasn’t coming into her powers until now then it would be easy for Gabe and his ex-wife to pass her off as their own child without arousing suspicion.  He made a mental note to do some research of his own when he got back from looking for Pete and Lana, of whom there was still no sign.  <br>
<br>
A horrible scent wafted into the truck and Clark’s face contorted in a gagged displeasure.  He covered his nose and mouth with one hand as he pulled the truck to the side of the road to look for the source of the offending odor.  Using his x-ray vision, he caught sight of what looked like a large mound of reptile stool.  The smell was ten times worse than anything that he ever had to shovel at the farm, but he had a bad feeling that he might find Pete and Lana there.  It would be just like Mr. Mxyzptlk to make him jump through this sort of hoop to get his friends back since he hadn’t tried to rescue them in the first place.<br>
<br>
Clark made his way over to the pile, cringing at the smell that was permeating his senses.  He didn’t even need to use his x-ray vision this time.  He saw something or someone trying to make its way out of the poop and knew immediately who it was.  He went over and plunged his arm down into it, pulling Pete out and placing him to the side while he rescued Lana.  When both of his friends were safely out, Clark noticed that Lana couldn’t stop shuddering in disgust.  He couldn’t blame her because if it wouldn’t have looked incredibly unmanly then he would have been doing the same.  <br>

And I should have told you before that this challenge will probably be another six chapter one.  Sorry.  This part takes place the next day.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“Not to be rude Clark, but don’t you think that’s a little…out there?” Pete asked.  “I mean, come on!  Chloe – my *best friend* Chloe – a space alien?  I think I would have noticed something like that.”<br>
<br>
“You didn’t with me,” Clark pointed out.  “And it makes sense.  According to the few records I was able to dig up; her parents were here during the meteor shower.  There was a credit card receipt for that little bed and breakfast that used to be out off the highway.”<br>
<br>
“Whoa.  Clark Kent super-hacker,” Pete said.  “I always thought that was Chloe’s gig.”  Clark tilted his head and gave his friend an exasperated expression.<br>
<br>
“It makes sense, Pete,” Clark said again.  “If my biological parents sent me here, what was to keep hers from doing the same?”  Pete shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I just think you’re way off here, man.  Why wouldn’t she have the same reaction to meteor rocks that you do?  Why wouldn’t she have powers?”<br>
<br>
“She *hurt* me,” Clark said, raising the cuff of his jeans just far enough for Pete to see the large bruise that had formed.  “Have you ever known anybody that was able to hurt me?”  Pete opened his mouth to speak and Clark held up a finger as he stopped him.  “*Without* the help of meteor rocks?”  Pete frowned and barely shook his head.<br>
<br>
“No.”<br>
<br>
“Exactly,” Clark said.  He paced back and forth a little bit and ran a hand through his hair.  “The thing that Dr. Swan told me, it said that I was the last *son* of Krypton.  What if Chloe ---”<br>
<br>
“What if this all has to do with that weird little floating guy that keeps bugging you?” Pete interrupted.  “Mr. ‘what’s his name’?  It would tie in with everything else that was happening, right?  Maybe he gave her some kind of temporary super powers to hurt you back.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know, Pete.  Maybe,” Clark half-conceded.  Pete let a lopsided grin cross his lips.<br>
<br>
“You sound disappointed,” he said.<br>
<br>
“I’m not,” Clark protested.  “I mean --- yeah, okay, I’m disappointed.  I was kind of warming up to the idea of having someone around that was like me.  Someone that ---” Pete snorted.<br>
<br>
“Someone meaning a *female* someone,” he said.  “Meaning that you and she would have some sort of ‘connection’,” Pete said, using his fingers to make quotation marks in the air, “and your decision between Lana and Chloe would finally be made for you.”  Clark gave him a sheepish grin and ran his hand over the back of his neck.<br>
<br>
“Can’t blame a guy for trying.”<br>
<br>
Pete shook his head and looked at his friend sympathetically.<br>
<br>
“Hey – if you want to go after Chloe, take her away from whatever brainwashing that Mr. M has put her under, then all the power to you,” Pete said with his trademark smile.  “And you’ll need it.  I talked to Lana this morning and she said that Chloe’s mom called and apparently she’s going to try and force her to go live with her.”  Clark’s mouth fell open and his skin paled.<br>
<br>
“She can’t do that,” Clark said to himself.  “If she *is* who I think she is and this isn’t just one of ---”<br>
<br>
“Call him Mr. M,” Pete interrupted and smiled brightly.  “He hates that.”  Clark arched an eyebrow, but chose not to question how Pete knew that.  He figured it had something to do with Lana, Pete, and the pile of dragon poop he found them in, and he was trying desperately to block the memory out of his head.<br>
<br>
“O-kay,” Clark strung out.  “Anyway, if he wasn’t responsible ---” he stopped talking and shook his head as he looked at the ground.  “I can’t lose her, Pete.  She’s one of my best friends – and even if she wasn’t ---”<br>
<br>
“She might be from Krypton and therefore your one true love,” Pete finished for him in a monotone voice and stamped down the desire to roll his eyes.  “What about Lana?  You still like her, right?”  Clark’s face contorted into a mixture of apprehension and confusion and Pete’s eyebrows rose.  “What?  When did this happen?  I thought you were in love with the girl.”<br>
<br>
“I was --- or at least I thought I was,” Clark said.  “I just ---”<br>
<br>
“Dude, you’d better not be basing this all on the Chloe thing from yesterday,” Pete said.  “Because ---”<br>
<br>
“I’m not!” Clark argued.  “I’m not – really.  Lana – she’s beautiful and sweet, but ---”<br>
<br>
“But?  Wow.  Never thought I’d hear that word coming out of your mouth after describing Lana.”<br>
<br>
“I know,” Clark said.  “But after spending more time with her, we just don’t really have a lot in common is all.”<br>
<br>
“Opposites attract,” Pete said with a shrug.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but we’re not opposites.  We’re just – I don’t know what we are,” Clark said, shoving his hands into his pockets.  “We don’t seem to be able to get past whatever issues we have.  I mean, it’s like there’s a big wall there still.  I don’t think I can keep lying to her, Pete.”<br>
<br>
“So don’t.”<br>
<br>
Clark’s eyes grew wide.<br>
<br>
“I can’t *tell* her, Pete!  Can you imagine how bad she would flip out?”<br>
<br>
“She understood about the meteor mutant thing and that’s just as bad.”<br>
<br>
“It’s not the same,” Clark objected.  “Put yourself in her shoes.  If I told you that I actually an alien and had just gone along with her previous assumptions to get out of telling her the truth ---”<br>
<br>
“And the meteors that came down with your ship crushed her parents – yeah, okay, I can see your point,” Pete said.  “Still though, how long have you two been pining after each other?  Like *forever*.  And you’re starting to have some doubts just because you don’t have very much in common, she doesn’t like you having secrets and is going to be pissed when she finds out that you lied to her, and Chloe *might* be a female member of the species from your home planet.”  Pete stopped talking and scrunched up his face.  “Huh.  Those are actually pretty good reasons.”  Clark nodded.<br>
<br>
“Plus – um - I’ve kind of been getting the vibes that she might like somebody else,” he said quietly.<br>
<br>
“Duh,” Pete said.  “She’s practically shacked up with Luthor.”<br>
<br>
“No, no – I meant Lana,” Clark said.  <br>
<br>
“Ohhh.  So that’s what this is all about,” Pete said in an overly dramatic tone.  “It’s all suddenly clear now – you’re *jealous*.  And you’re trying to keep Chloe on the line as your contingency plan.”  ‘Just like always,’ he thought and then paused for a second.  “Wait a minute - what makes you think that Lana likes somebody else?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know – it’s just a feeling,” Clark admitted.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah, well, your ‘feelings’ are usually pretty spot-on,” Pete said.  “Except for that whole thing with Lex – I’ve gotta say, even after seeing monchichi ---”<br>
<br>
“Monchichi?”<br>
<br>
Pete beamed a smile at him.<br>
<br>
“It’s the nickname I came up with for Lena,” he responded somewhat proudly.  “I was calling her ‘monkey’, but ---” Clark narrowed his eyes somewhat suspiciously at him and Pete rolled his eyes.  “Okay, the point is that I still don’t like Lex --- no matter how cute their kid is.”  <br>
<br>
Clark snickered, but his demeanor quickly changed and he ran a nervous hand through his hair while he looked at his friend pleadingly.<br>
<br>
“So what should I do?  About Lana I mean.  Because I still like her, but if she likes somebody else, then I don’t want to stand in her way.  We’ve finally gotten our friendship to the point where I don’t want to risk losing it over something like this.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know.  I haven’t seen Lana looking at any other guys except for you, but if you want, I can ask her ---”<br>
<br>
“That’d be great,” Clark said a little too quickly.  A blush rose to his cheeks and he ducked his head.  “Just – you know ---”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, yeah,” Pete said and flipped his hand.  “You want me to be sneaky about it.”  Clark nodded and Pete rolled his eyes again.  “You’re so going to owe me.”<br>
<br>
“I pulled you out of a massive pile of dragon manure,” Clark reminded him.  Pete shuddered and then held a warning finger in the air.<br>
<br>
“We never speak of that again.”  <br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“There’s *got* to be another way,” Chloe said, flopping her head down into her hands in exhausted defeat.  “I’m only seventeen; I’m too young to get married.”<br>
<br>
“Well, I would suggest just lying about it, because I’m sure that Lex would back up your claim, but I have a feeling they’d find out,” Gabe said.  Chloe grumbled and gave a pout more characteristic of Lana than herself.  <br>
<br>
“Who’d find out about what?” Lana said as she came into the room, rubbing a towel over her wet hair.<br>
<br>
“You washed it again?” Chloe asked with some amusement.  “I think the smell is gone now.”  Lana made a face.<br>
<br>
“I just wanted to make sure.  You have no idea how horrible that was.”<br>
<br>
“I’m really sorry about that, Lana,” Chloe said.  Lana shook her head.<br>
<br>
“It wasn’t your fault,” she replied.  “But if I ever see Babu again, he’d better watch out.”<br>
<br>
“Babu?”<br>
<br>
“Oh, um – it was the name he gave me when he pretended to be a genie,” Lana said.  “I can’t pronounce his other one.”  Chloe smiled in understanding and Gabe cleared his throat.<br>
<br>
“Not to be mean, but we should get back to the topic at hand,” he said.  Chloe’s smile immediately fell.<br>
<br>
“I’m too young to get married, Dad.  And ---”<br>
<br>
“You’re getting married?!” Lana squealed happily, a bright smile on her face.  Chloe cringed and held her hands out in front of her.<br>
<br>
“No!  No, no – too *young* to get married.”<br>
<br>
“Actually, since we’re in Kansas, you could have gotten married when you were sixteen without your dad’s permission,” Lana said.  Gabe arched an eyebrow, but decided not to question his daughter’s friend about how she knew that particular fact.<br>
<br>
“That’s not the point, Lana.”<br>
<br>
“Yes it is,” Lana argued and moved to sit next to Chloe on the couch.  “Ooh – and your baby girl was soooo cu-ute.  Well, except for throwing her stuffed dragon at me, but I think all kids are a little mischievous.”<br>
<br>
Chloe looked up to her father for support, but he was just looking back down at her expectantly.<br>
<br>
“I’m not even shaped like them.  Why would she want me there anyway?” Chloe grumbled, half changing the topic.  “Oh!  Maybe I could send them a picture and my vital stats.  Once they see that I’m short and ---”<br>
<br>
“I doubt that will matter, Chloe,” Gabe interrupted.  “And you’re stereotyping.  Not all women there ---”<br>
<br>
“But ---” Chloe trailed off with a sigh that quickly spread into a cheeky grin.  “You know, *technically*, Lex hasn’t even asked me; so it’s really kind of a moot point.”  Lana squealed again and lunged toward her to envelop her in a large hug.<br>
<br>
“You’re going to do it!  You’re going to get married!”<br>
<br>
“Lana,” Chloe said as she pulled away.  “He hasn’t asked me yet.”<br>
<br>
“*Yet* being the operative word,” Lana said with full confidence.  <br>
<br>
“And I’m sure a simple phone call can remedy that,” Gabe chimed in.  Chloe groaned.<br>
<br>
“Maybe going to live with mom wouldn’t be so bad after all.”<br>

<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk leaned his head on his hand, tapping his fingers against the side of his face as he invisibly eavesdropped on Clark and Pete’s conversation.  He knew from the time he spent in the future that the only other people who showed up from Clark’s doomed home world of Krypton were General Zod and his cronies, and Supergirl Linda Danvers, though technically she was from a parallel earth.<br>
<br>
When Mr. Mxyzptlk pushed past his inner ramblings, the question still remained.  Who was Chloe Sullivan and how had she been able to hurt Clark?  He figured there was nothing like going to the source itself, so he zapped himself over to Chloe’s house right in time to hear her conversation with Gabe and Lana.  <br>
<br>
He pursed his lips and clenched his hands into tiny fists when he heard Lana refer to him as ‘Babu’, but still listened intently to the dialogue between the three people.  <br>
<br>
‘She doesn’t want to get married to Lex…interesting,’ Mr. Mxyzptlk mused.  ‘Not that I can blame her, because who would want to marrbut the way those two go at it, I figured that she’d --- shaped like them?  What’s that supposed to mean?’  <br>
<br>
Gabe sat down and leaned forward in his chair, giving his daughter a sympathetic smile.<br>
<br>
“You know, you’re going to have to tell him either way,” he said.  Mr. Mxyzptlk and Lana both furrowed their brows.<br>
<br>
“Not if I go to live with her,” Chloe argued.  “Lex will just think that the custody thing was changed and ---”<br>
<br>
“Chloe,” Gabe interrupted and then winced, “I hate to bring this up – I *really* hate to – but you could already be pregnant with the man’s child.  He has a right to know what he’s gotten himself into.”<br>
<br>
“Why?  So he can know that I’ll be forced to leave him and my daughter in a few years anyway?” Chloe asked, quickly adding, “And I can’t be pregnant, because apparently Lena was conceived in a cabin.”  Gabe arched an eyebrow at her and she gave him a nervous half-smile.  “Long story.”  Gabe shook his head.<br>
<br>
“You were born *and* raised here,” he started, “if you get married before ever setting foot on their land, then technically their rules won’t apply to you anymore and you won’t have to leave.”<br>
<br>
“But ---”<br>
<br>
“Your mom was born and raised *there*, Chloe,” Gabe said understandingly, “she’s bound by their laws no matter where she goes.”<br>
<br>
 Lana scrunched up her face, barely following the father/daughter conversation at all.<br>
<br>
“What are you guys talking about?” she asked with a befuddled smile.  “You’re making it sound like Chloe’s mom is from some really strict country or something.”<br>
<br>
“Something like that,” Gabe replied dryly, trying his best not to sound too condescending.  <br>
<br>
“Then why would their laws have ever applied to her?  She’s a U.S. citizen!  They can’t go bossing her around!” Lana stated with loud indignation.<br>
<br>
“Oh, God,” Mr. Mxyzptlk groaned aloud.  Chloe, Lana, and Gabe’s eyes all darted around the room to see where the voice came from and Mr. Mxyzptlk obliged them by appearing mid-air in front of Chloe.  <br>
<br>
“Babu?” Lana gasped, her eyes wide as she covered her open mouth with her hand.  Mr. Mxyzptlk whipped his head around for a second and scowled at her.<br>
<br>
“Mxyzptlk!  Mr. Mxyzptlk!” he yelled in frustration.  “Why is that so hard for you to remember?”  He turned back around to face Chloe and then shook his head slightly in what appeared to be despair.  “You are, aren’t you?  You know, you should really tell me these sorts of things before I go and hook you up with Superman’s nemesis.”<br>
<br>
“What?” Chloe asked.  “And – excuse me?!  I can only assume that you’re talking about Lex, and I don’t remember ever even being consulted!”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk waved his hand in the air nonchalantly as if to brush off her comment.<br>
<br>
“Details,” Mr. Mxyzptlk said, waving his hand nonchalantly in the air as if to brush off her comment.  He frowned as a thought came to him.  “No wonder I couldn’t remember you from the future, you were probably shipped off to the Amazon in the original history.  Damn!  I’m gonna be in so much trouble…”<br>
<br>
“Amazon?” Lana asked, her facial features still marred in a thoroughly confused expression.  “What is he talking about?”  Chloe sighed and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“It’s nothing,” she lied.  Mr. Mxyzptlk scoffed and was about to mount a rebuttal when the doorbell rang.  Lana gave Mr. Mxyzptlk a look before pushing herself out of her seat and going to answer the door.<br>
<br>
“You --- behave,” she said, pointing a finger at him as she walked backward toward the foyer.  <br>
<br>
“What does she think I am?  A dog?” Mr. Mxyzptlk asked indignantly. <br>
<br>
“Well…” Gabe started, but then just left whatever he was going to say hanging there as Chloe shot him a warning look.  <br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk laced his fingers together behind his head and leaned back in the air.  He gave Chloe a smarmy smile and she raised her eyebrows at him.<br>
<br>
“Listen doll, what do I have to do to get you to seal the deal with Luthor over there?”<br>
<br>
Chloe’s face washed with a look of disgust.<br>
<br>
“I really, *really* hope that wasn’t an innuendo,” she said half under her breath.<br>
<br>
“Hey!  Don’t knock it till you tried it,” Mr. Mxyzptlk said and then winked at her.  Chloe shuddered and Mr. Mxyzptlk rolled his eyes.  “What?  You think you’re going to have your choice of guys once you have to go live with your mom in the jungle?”  He shook his head.  “Hate to break it to you kiddo, but your mom had to leave just to find *him*,” he said and motioned toward Gabe with his head.  <br>
<br>
“Hey!” Gabe objected.  <br>
<br>
“Look, I’m just sayin’, would it really be so bad if you married Lex?” Mr. Mxyzptlk asked.  “He’s rich, he’s smart, he --- has extra fast healing abilities,” he offered lamely, but then his face lit up with a genuine grin.  “He could pass that gene on to Lena, you know?  Then she could be a little warrior girl who can heal quickly…why does that sound so familiar?”<br>
<br>
Chloe stared blankly at him for a second.<br>
<br>
“You’ve been watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” she said dryly.  <br>
<br>
Gabe rubbed his eyes and walked away, mumbling something about needed a drink as he left the room.<br>
<br>
“You!”<br>
<br>
Chloe and Mr. Mxyzptlk turned their heads to see Clark standing there, pointing angrily at the floating imp.  Mr. Mxyzptlk smiled broadly.<br>
<br>
“Me,” he confirmed happily in a sing-song voice.  <br>
<br>
“Are you responsible for this?” Clark demanded.<br>
<br>
“For what?”<br>
<br>
“For Chloe’s mom suddenly being interested in her life,” Clark said with hints of sarcasm and suspicion lining his voice.  He stepped toward Mr. Mxyzptlk menacingly, not noticing the effect his sentence had on Chloe.  <br>
<br>
Chloe frowned at Clark’s choice of words because they stung.  As irrational as it may have sounded to her once she said the words aloud, Chloe had always seen what her mother had done to her and her dad as abandonment.  True, she was just following the laws of her heritage; but Chloe, generally speaking, wasn’t someone who let rules stand in the way of something she wanted, and she had a hard time believing that *anyone* would desert the two people they loved most in the world just because some council told them that they had to.  <br>
<br>
The tone in which Clark spoke pulled her from her thoughts and she looked up to where he and Mr. Mxyzptlk were only inches apart and staring each other down.<br>
<br>
“Did you?” she asked, her eyes fixed on Mr. Mxyzptlk.  The floating imp looked astonished by the accusation and he held up his hands.<br>
<br>
“No, no, of course not,” he answered.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, and you’ve been so honest so far,” Clark said with heavy sarcasm.  Mr. Mxyzptlk folded his arms across his chest and rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“If I was behind her mom getting in touch with her, would I be trying to get her to marry Luthor?” he asked and then paused for a second as he thought about it.  “Okay, I see your point, but I’m still not behind it.”<br>
<br>
“So you didn’t give her the power to hurt me?” Clark asked skeptically.  Pete had done a good job of convincing him that everything that was happening with Chloe was all due to Mr. Mxyzptlk’s outside influence and now Clark was not only angry with Mr. Mxyzptlk, but also with himself for believing that Chloe could have been from Krypton.  <br>
<br>
“No-ooo,” Mr. Mxyzptlk strung out, “her mom gave her that.”  The anger on Clark’s face faded into confusion and he blinked a couple of times before responding.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“Your friend here is an --- mmmph,” Mr. Mxyzptlk’s eyes grew wide as Chloe jumped up from her seat and covered his mouth within a second’s period of time.  Chloe forced a fake smile at Clark and he narrowed his eyes at her.<br>
<br>
“Chloe?”<br>
<br>
Chloe looked past Clark and spotted Lana, who appeared to be trying to make sense out of everything that had been said.  She gave her a pleading look and Lana smiled and nodded, happy to be part of the inner circle of someone’s secret for once – even if she hadn’t actually figured out what it was yet.<br>
<br>
“Clark,” Lana started, placing her hand on the young man’s upper arm.  Clark looked down at her in surprise and she beamed a smile at him.  “Did I tell you how grateful I am that you saved my life?”<br>
<br>
“I – uh – it was nothing,” Clark stammered.  Chloe let out a breath of relief as she thought that she was in the clear, but her body quickly stiffened as Clark turned back around and his eyes seemed to be boring into her.<br>
<br>
“What?” she asked uncomfortably.  Clark stepped closer to her.<br>
<br>
“It’s okay, Chloe,” he said.  Mr. Mxyzptlk’s little slip had been enough for Clark to disregard everything Pete had said.  <br>
<br>
“I’m not sure I know what you’re talking about,” she replied.  Clark looked up at Mr. Mxyzptlk, who was now floating much higher than Chloe’s arm could extend to cover his mouth.<br>
<br>
“You said she’s *an* - you were going to say ‘alien’, right?” Clark asked in a sure tone.  Chloe’s jaw dropped and her eyes threatened to pop out of her head.<br>
<br>
“What?!”<br>
<br>

Story 7: Motherly Love - Chapter 4<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“Why would you automatically jump to *that* conclusion?” Chloe asked in an angry, insulted tone, her hands placed firmly on her hips.<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk smiled evilly at Clark as he folded his small arms smugly across his chest.<br>
<br>
“Yes, Clark, do tell,” he said, every note of his voice tweaked with utter delight.  “What could have possibly made you think that the little blonde girl is an alien?” <br>
<br>
Chloe tilted her head to the side at him.<br>
<br>
“First of all, *little*?  I hardly think you’re in a position to be throwing a description like that one around.  And second, I have a name, you know?”<br>
<br>
“So do I, but you never use it,” Mr. Mxyzptlk shot back.<br>
<br>
“Because I can’t pronounce it!”<br>
<br>
“I *told* you how to say it!” Mr. Mxyzptlk yelled, his face turning red with angry frustration as he balled his hands into fists at his sides.  “What more do you want?  A phonetic cue card?!” <br>
<br>
Sensing that the mischievous imp was about to pass the boundaries of his temper and lash out at Chloe, Clark cleared his throat and stepped forward to intervene.<br>
<br>
“You guys, just…calm down, okay?”<br>
<br>
Chloe crossed her arms and Mr. Mxyzptlk let out a huff of air.  <br>
<br>
“Fine,” they both grumbled like spoiled children.<br>
<br>
“Good,” Clark said, letting go of the breath he had been holding in.  ‘Man, that was too close.’  He desperately wanted to know what the big secret about Chloe’s lineage was now that the last daughter of Krypton thing had been ruled out, but in a fleeting moment of common sense, he realized that it wasn’t the right time to bring it up.<br>
<br>
The phone rang loudly, startling everyone from the uncomfortable silence that had creeped into the room.  Chloe ran one hand over the back of her neck to soothe the now-tensed muscles that lay there, hesitating before picking up the phone with her other hand.<br>
<br>
‘Who knows?  Maybe it’s Lex and I can get the fuck out of here,’ she thought.  “Hello?”<br>
<br>
“Chloe?” a surprised woman’s voice returned.  “Is that you?”<br>
<br>
Chloe frowned.<br>
<br>
“Ye-ah,” she answered slowly.  “Who is this?”  She already suspected the answer and a knot began to form in her stomach while she waited for what seemed like forever before the woman spoke again.<br>
<br>
“Chloe, honey, it’s me – it’s your mom.”<br>
<br>
Chloe closed her eyes and sucked in a deep breath to try and fight off the sudden, overwhelming bout of nausea that swept through her.  She shakily held the phone out to her dad.<br>
<br>
“It’s for you.”<br>
<br>
Gabe nodded once as he took the phone from her, attributing her demeanor to all of the things that had just happened in the living room.<br>
<br>
“This is Gabe.”<br>
<br>
“Gabe?  This is Ann.”<br>
<br>
“Ahh,” Gabe said in understanding.  He stole a quick, concerned look at his daughter before turning his attention back to the conversation.  “Hi.”<br>
<br>
“Hi,” she responded somewhat sadly.  “I’m guessing from her reaction that she didn’t take the news quite as well as I’d hoped.”<br>
<br>
“You could say that.”<br>
<br>
“Gabe, you know that I have no control over this,” she said.  “And I want to see her – I never wanted to leave the two of you in the first place, but the rules ---”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, about that,” Gabe started, only to be interrupted by Mr. Mxyzptlk.<br>
<br>
“This is *boring*,” Mr. Mxyzptlk pouted.  Gabe scowled at him and he smiled mischievously.  “But I know what would make it better.”<br>
<br>
“Listen,” Gabe said into the phone, still keeping a steady eye on the floating imp, “I might have to call you ba---”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk snapped his fingers and a beautiful blonde woman dressed in a long toga-esque sheet appeared out of nowhere in front of them.  Her petite yet curvy frame closely mirrored Chloe’s and although her eyes were sea-blue, their shape and the sparkle in them reminded Chloe of her own.<br>
<br>
Clark and Lana’s jaws both dropped open and Clark tipped his head to the side as he gazed at the Amazon beauty in front of them.<br>
<br>
“Well,” he started and then paused, “that *is* more…interesting.”  Lana pursed her lips in jealousy when she saw how Clark was leering at the stranger and Chloe backhanded his chest.<br>
<br>
“That’s my *mom*, jackass!”<br>
<br>
“Ouch!”  Clark rubbed the now-sore spot on his chest and then looked back at the woman with long, wavy blonde hair. <br>
<br>
“That’s your *mom*?” both Clark and Lana asked at the same time.<br>
<br>
“B-but,” Clark stuttered and then leaned his head to the side again.  “She’s ---”<br>
<br>
“She’s too young to be your mom, Chloe,” Lana cut in and then gave Chloe a sympathetic yet condescending smile.  “Maybe she just looks like her.”<br>
<br>
“Or maybe Mxyzptlk zapped her in from the past,” Clark said.  His eyes ran down Ann again.  “From a Halloween party or something.”  <br>
<br>
Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, don’t I wish,” she muttered under her breath.  Her mom stepped toward her, a joyous, nervous smile plastered across her face.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe,” she said lovingly, her arms opening up to give the daughter she hadn’t seen in so many years a hug.<br>
<br>
“I’m not going there,” Chloe said, the strong emotion racking her body coming through in her voice.  <br>
<br>
“Chloe ---”<br>
<br>
Gabe looked past the back of his ex-wife to Chloe and met her pleading eyes with his own.  He let out a small sigh and stepped forward, placing a hand on Ann’s shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Antiope, there’s something you need to know,” he said.  Ann turned around and looked at him questioningly, trying to fight down the shiver of pleasure that swept through her with his touch.  “Chloe’s engaged – they’re getting married – they’re having a baby.”  He paused for a second, glancing at Chloe and hoping she took the hint to keep her mouth shut instead of protesting.  “She can’t go back with you.  She wasn’t born there, she wasn’t raised there, and she’s already committed to a male here.  That’s in your rules too.  If she hadn’t been involved with Lex, then maybe, but ---”<br>
<br>
“No,” Ann argued and shook her head in disbelief.  “She’s only seventeen.  She can’t get married, she can’t ---” she trailed off and whipped back around to look at Chloe.  “Is this true?”<br>
<br>
“Mom ---”<br>
<br>
“Is this true?” she repeated.  “Or is your father just trying to keep you away from your destiny?”<br>
<br>
“It’s not my destiny, mom,” Chloe said, running a shaky hand through her short, flippy hair.  “I’ve seen my future, and believe me, being on Themyscira isn’t it.”<br>
<br>
Ann furrowed her brow suspiciously.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean you have seen the future?”<br>
<br>
“Uh ---” Chloe stalled and then pointed at Mr. Mxyzptlk.  He ran a hand over his face.<br>
<br>
“Oh, shi---”<br>
<br>
“You!” Ann roared and the house seemed to vibrate.  “Mischievous imp from the fifth dimension.  *You* have summoned me here?!”<br>
<br>
“I can explain,” Mr. Mxyzptlk said, holding his hands out in front of him to defend himself.<br>
<br>
“*And* you showed my daughter her future?”<br>
<br>
“Well, I ---”<br>
<br>
Lana touched Clark’s arm and motioned for him to bring his head down so she could whisper into his ear.<br>
<br>
“Why isn’t he just blinking away?” she asked.  Clark shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know.”<br>
<br>
“Because I can’t,” Mr. Mxyzptlk said through gritted teeth.  “After my last little game on their ‘precious’ island, Hera made a change in my powers.  I can’t leave by my normal means if there are two or more of them present.”<br>
<br>
“Hera?” Lana asked.  “Like Greek mythology, Hera?”  Mr. Mxyzptlk raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“*You* know about Greek mythology?”<br>
<br>
Lana glared at him, but the door bell rang before she could move toward him to try and hurt him.  <br>
<br>
Gabe looked at the others in the room, all poised in defensive positions, and gave a small roll of his eyes before making his way to the front door.<br>
<br>
“I should have stayed in Metropolis,” he mumbled to himself as he reached for the doorknob.  He let out a half-snort of twisted amusement, opening the door wide and seeing who was standing on the other side.  “Like I couldn’t have guessed.”<br>
<br>
“Pardon?” Lex asked and stepped past him into the house.<br>
<br>
“Nothing,” Gabe said dismissively and shut the door.  “She’s in the living room.”  Lex nodded and casually walked beside Gabe as he headed back to the other room.  Gabe stopped and turned around right before the other people in his house came into Lex’s view.  “You should know that things have gotten pretty ugly in there.”  Lex gave him a questioning look.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?  Is Chloe alright?”<br>
<br>
“Fine – er – sort of,” Gabe said.  He sighed and rubbed his eyes with his fingers.  “How do I say this?  You know that…creature…who has been causing a bunch of trouble?”  Lex nodded.  “Well, he sort of blinked Chloe’s mom into the living room.”<br>
<br>
“What?” Lex said, losing his usually cool demeanor and letting the panic he felt show on his face.  “She’s not going to try and take Chloe is she?  Gabe, you can’t let her do that.  I ---”<br>
<br>
“I sort of told her that you and Chloe were getting married and having a baby,” Gabe said and then winced, expecting that Lex would react just as poorly as Chloe had done to the idea of getting married.<br>
<br>
“Oh.  Well…good,” Lex said in surprise.  “Did it help?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t think she believed me,” Gabe replied.  One corner of Lex’s lips curled upward to smirk at him and he removed a small black velvet box from his inner jacket pocket.<br>
<br>
