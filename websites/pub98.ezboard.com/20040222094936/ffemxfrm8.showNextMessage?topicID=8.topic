Hi all. ^_^<br>
<br>
I've been working on this Marrow/Storm fic, it's not finished but i just wanted to see what people think so far and tell me if there's anything that could be improved on<br>
<br>
Enjoy<br>
<br>
The Bone<br>
<br>
By Silverbolt<br>
<br>
*****<br>
I don’t own X-men (wish I did cuz then I’d be rich!)<br>
<br>
This is a little thing before Marrow’s transformation due to the Skrull technology.<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Quiet.<br>
<br>
Things were always quiet in Marrow’s room, even when she was going through her nightly ritual.<br>
<br>
She carefully stepped to her door and placed her ear against it, listening carefully for anyone or anything outside her door. She didn’t want to be disturbed when she did this.<br>
<br>
She turned the key in the lock and tested to make sure it didn’t open. She had made a mistake once of leaving her door unlocked during one of her private times and it had resulted in a deep embarrassment that thankfully hadn’t become public knowledge to the other X-men other than the one other individual.<br>
<br>
She took a quick peek outside her windows before she closed the curtains. She didn’t trust anyone and she knew a few of her fellow ‘team mates’ had the gift of flight, including the pretty little weather bitch. She didn’t want to take any chances.<br>
<br>
She stood in the middle of her room, taking a step to the left just to turn the mirror on her desk around. She didn’t like watching this; it was painful enough as it was without having to see it as well!<br>
<br>
She clenched her teeth as she took hold of the bony piece that erected from the side of her arm and pulled upwards and then back down again. She growled deeply as the bone snapped from within her skin and popped right out, leaving a bloodied hole where it had been. It hurt, but it would heal in a while. It had already begun to scab over as she reached for the other bone in her arm, which broke off with the same sting as the one before.<br>
<br>
She tossed it to the floor next to her bed, into the trash bag that she always threw the others. One after the other she tore, ripped and broke off, until at last all but the smaller and less pointed bones were gone.<br>
<br>
She collapsed to her glove-covered hands and bony armoured knees at last, breathing heavily in both pain and relief.<br>
<br>
She was always in constant pain, the bone growths scattered inside and out of her body saw to that, but at least this way she could have what would be, at least by her standards, a good nights sleep.<br>
<br>
Back in the tunnels where she had been but a girl all those years… or in this dimension, months ago, she had had no bed, only straw and a few pieces of cloth for a pillow. But back then she hadn’t had these accursed growths either!<br>
<br>
Things had been better back then when she had been a Morlock. Things may not had been pretty pretty like the stupid upworlders, but at least everyone cared for one another and they didn’t judge each other by their looks, at least… not back then…<br>
<br>
She sighed as she removed her clothing, sitting on the bed to remove her boots. She never wore anything in bed. Her bones would have torn through whatever clothing she wore during the night, and besides… she liked to feel the softness of her covers as they warmed and caressed her body whilst she slumbered. Her dreams were always nicer that way.<br>
<br>
She chucked the heavy boots against the wall, not caring where they landed. Tidiness had no place her life; it’s not like she owned enough things to actually make her room messy with. All she had were her clothes, her bones, her boots and…<br>
<br>
She wrinkled her nose as she felt something crackle underneath her naked backside. She stood up and peeled the intruding piece of paper off her buttocks with wide-open eyes and a nasty grin.<br>
<br>
Another trophy that she had taken from Pretty Kitty’s room. She carefully bent her legs, wincing for a moment as a bony structure from the back of her thigh pressed uncomfortably into the back of her lower leg. She felt under her bed for the other little treasure she kept. She pulled out a small metal box and gently placed it on her bed, before she got back on herself. She held the metal box up close to her chest for a moment, just in case someone knocked on her door at that very moment. The box was cold and it felt like the heat was being sapped from her very body with every second.<br>
<br>
She placed it on the sheets between her legs and gingerly opened the top and peered inside.<br>
<br>
She had collected pictures like this for as long as she could remember, sometimes it sickened her that she did, shamed her even.<br>
<br>
They were pictures of beautiful women, cut from newspapers, advertisements, magazines, posters, you name it, and it was in there!<br>
<br>
She stared at the newest addition to her collection, biting her lips almost in frustration, as the woman in the picture smiled back at her with her pretty, pretty smile and her pretty, pretty red hair. A grunt of primal anger rumbled from her throat as she scrunched up the image and tossed it into the box and closing it with a slam.<br>
<br>
She closed her eyes with an angry snarl and fell backwards onto her pillows, kicking the box off the bed. The box opened with an almighty clang as it hit the carpeted floor, the pictures scattering everywhere.<br>
<br>
Sarah looked up at the ceiling, not caring about the noise that she had produced. All she was thinking about were those pictures… of all those lucky Upworlders.<br>
<br>
They had it so easy didn’t they? They were all so pretty, pretty weren’t they? They didn’t know what it was like to be her. They didn’t know what it was like to stared at all the time, to be stared at by the other X-Men. They could fit in anywhere couldn’t they? They didn’t have these bones! They didn’t have all this pain! They looked… normal!<br>
<br>
Nightcrawler may not look human, but at least they accepted him!<br>
<br>
They didn’t have to spend years trapped in a dimension that had the rule ‘kill or be killed’ sewn into you brain!<br>
<br>
She turned to one side and felt under her pillow for a carefully wrapped piece of paper. A sketch of herself, drawn by the mutant Colossus, just for her.<br>
<br>
She remembered well when Peter had caught her unaware in her room to give her the picture and discovered her looking at all the beautiful women she had secretly pinned up on her wall. She had shamefully told him that she liked to look at the women and he had respectfully kept her secret, not realising that there were… other reasons why she liked to look at women.<br>
<br>
She smiled to herself. There had been quite a few males that she liked at the institute… but none of them ever showed her the affection that she so secretly craved for.<br>
<br>
She like Peter, he was a very good artist and treated her as if she didn’t have any bones poking out of her cheeks… but he didn’t have feelings for her, she knew that. Marrow had seen the way he had looked at Rogue, even if neither he nor the southern female could tell themselves.<br>
<br>
Gambit had interested her once, just once, but not anymore. Not after discovering that it had been HIS fault for the Morlock massacre. He had rescued her when she was but a child from a Marauder, but that would never appease for the deaths of all the other innocent Morlocks. The Cajun would NEVER be able to pay for his crimes, not in her eyes anyway.<br>
<br>
As for Wolverine… She never liked him, he had humiliated her once in a fight in the Danger Room and wounded her pride. Made her realise that she wasn’t the great warrior she had claimed to be… humiliated her!<br>
<br>
Then there had been Angel. Sweet, kind Angel. A hero in her eyes, eyes that had seen the agonising pain as he had been crucified by the wings against the wall by the monstrous Marauders. They had shot him and beaten him and stripped him of his beautiful, feathery white wings.<br>
<br>
He had called her beautiful once, and it had filled Marrow’s heart with such indescribable, and yet, from what she had found in his bedroom, which she had entered only to see how her hero lived, he had shown more affection for the Psychic mutant, Psylocke, than for her, he had even had a relationship with her from the photographs that poor Marrow had found. He obviously saw the purple much more attractive than her…<br>
<br>
She hugged her naked body as she curled up into a ball, starting to at last feel the chill of the air conditioner.<br>
<br>
She didn’t like the cold, had never liked the cold. The nights had always been freezing in that other horrible dimension ‘The Hill’ and it had been a battle just to stay warm with what little she had!<br>
<br>
The had been no better neither, they were even more deadly! The only food that was available the vile lizards and savage birds that plagued and they always tried to take a bite out of you first! Sometimes it had been necessary to consume the flesh of fallen Morlocks, but that had always been a last reserve! Always!<br>
<br>
The air had been putrid, each breath was like sandpaper being dragged down your wind pipe and when the acid rain beat down on the ground… well, you had either be resistant to the deadly poisons or hidden deep within the caves scattered round ‘The Hill’<br>
<br>
When Marrow had been cast down from the top of ‘The Hill’ when her mutant powers began to manifest themselves, she had seen the devastating effect of the rain. Watched as each tiny drop burnt into a fellow Morlocks body like miniature drills! She had watched in horror as the mutant known as Horn, because of the spikes sticking out of her face, scream in agony as she desperately attempted to escape into the tunnels that Sarah and the others had reached, but she had tripped just as the mighty downpour came down… <br>
<br>
She never had a chance.<br>
<br>
A few minutes after the rain had begun its reign of terror, Horn’s body had been eaten away to nothing but bone, and even those were eventually dissolved to nothing, except for the strange metallic flower she had picked moments before. That had survived and had shown the others that the techno-organic vegetation that scattered the grounds was very useful, especially for clothing and shelter…<br>
<br>
She pushed herself off the bed, hissing in pain as she clenched her side. Another bone had started to grow already. She sighed as she stood up and pulled back the covers so she could slip inside, but as she did so, something on the floor caught her eye.<br>
<br>
The ex-leader of Gene Nation crouched down onto one knee and pulled out one of her discarded bones from the pile. She stared at it with interest. It had been a while since she had grown a bone on her back as… shapely as this.<br>
<br>
It was smooth, the bottom still jagged and stained with blood she noted as she turned the long length over and over again in her hands before holding it out in front of herself. She ran a finger over the top of the rounded end with a smile as she stepped over to the chest of drawers and turned the mirror back round to face her naked form.<br>
<br>
She smirked at her reflection. At least there were some assets on her body that had never been ruined by her mutation!<br>
<br>
She ran the bone over the swell of her breast, the nipples already tightening against the deep chill of the room. She traced the circle of her aureole before pulling the bone lightly into the middle of her chest and tracing the scar where Storm had cut out her heart. A lot of her scars healed, but this one never did, the one where the weather bitch had plunged one of Marrow’s own bone daggers into her chest and tore the still beating heart that held the detonator that would have killed the humans that Gene Nation had captured in remembrance of fallen Morlocks. They would have got away with it too if it hadn’t been for that meddling Ororo’s interference!<br>
<br>
It was fortunate that Marrow had had two hearts!<br>
<br>
How she hated Storm, it had been her fault that that Sarah’s life had ended up like this.<br>
<br>
Storm had defeated Callisto in battle, taken her leadership from her, humiliated her! Storm had been a bad leader. When the massacre pf the Morlocks had taken place, Storm had been nowhere in sight!<br>
<br>
She hadn’t cared!<br>
<br>
If she had been a leader she would have been there! She would have tried to help the poor mutants if she had been any kind of a leader!<br>
<br>
Marrow cursed under her breath as she returned to her bed, the anger that boiled in her blood made her forget about the bothersome cold. She sat on the duvet still clutching the bone.<br>
<br>
She wanted to get back at Storm, but she knew she never could. Storm had too many friends to protect her, there was no way of getting to her.<br>
<br>
The bony mutant closed her eyes, absentmindedly stroking the inside of her legs towards the small tuft of blood red curls.<br>
<br>
What would she do if she ever got the chance?<br>
<br>
She smiled as she traced the scar on her chest with her bone, a wicked smile beginning to dance on her lips.<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
She knew what she would do…<br>

There are a few missing words in a few places, but otherwise very smooth and gripping.  I don't know ANYTHING really about Marrow, but found myself fascinated by the voice you've given her.  Hard, yearning, bitter yet vulnerable.  Great build up to something more to come.<br>
<br>
I would very much like to see what happens next.<br>
