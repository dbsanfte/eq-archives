You were good honey but I was better. Now I maybe should have told you about myself before I killed you but oh well, I don't mind talking to you now.<br>
<br>
I'm Midnight Rayne, a dhampire born in Russia in one hundred years ago. Don't you like how I look? A slender red head beauty with pale white skin and dark circles around her eyes? Didn't you just love how my lush breasts spill from my revealing leather top, how my full red lips parted to show my fangs? One hundred years have done me good for I look to be in my mid twenties don't I? I'm not very tall, only five foot seven inches but taller then you since I now hold your head in my hands.<br>
<br>
Liked my skills? I can tell by the look frozen on your face that you do... Heh Being a dhampire is so exciting. I'm fast and strong and to mortals my movements can seem like a blur when I move as fast as I can. However to you, my dear dead vampire, my movements and strength were not at strong or fast as yours but I still won... hehe lets discuss why shall we?<br>
<br>
I'm trained in the arts of martial arts, brute army hand to hand combat and weapons of various sorts. I wish I could have showed you all my toys but you seemed eager to die. You met my single sword which comes apart into two, but I have a shiny pair of Magnums, a bowgun, a couple of daggers and a sniper rifle. I also possess a set of police riot clubs that are actually swords which pop out like a switch blade from the shaft.<br>
<br>
Did you like how I read your mind? Silly vampire, you should have blocked your thoughts for I could not have read them then. I wonder what your thinking now as I look into your eyes hmmmm? Still remembering how my kisses tasted before I stabbed you in the back? Well I can't believe my seduction worked on you... you must have been really desperate to think you could sleep with a gothic dhampire. Seduction... how I like that game, many men and women have fallen as you do because of it. I lure them to bed and does it ever get messy. Of course there are more noble men and women out there that did not fall for my games so I had to just use the direct approach to claim their life and blood.<br>
<br>
I can also heal small wounds like cuts, broken bones and bruises. But even I have to be careful for I'm fifty percent human and what can kill them can kill me to. Its annoying but sadly the reality. The more broken bones, larger cuts, the longer to heal though quicker then if I was a human and in the hospital. Say I broke both my legs. A human would be in a cast for weeks where as I would only be in one for half the time. I think you get the picture.<br>
<br>
You know, I'm not entirely different from you. You kill mortals and assume vampire hunters seek you out to save them. Well I'll have you know I slay mortals as well as it suits me. But I killed you because I simply despise you and your kind with all my black heart.<br>
<br>
Seeing as how we never got to get to know eachother before I killed you, I might as well tell you I'm a total bitch now. Bet you wished you knew that sooner eh? Ah well, and seeing as how your beyond the point to do anything about it, I might as well tell you my weaknesses as well.<br>
<br>
I'm not as strong as a vampire, I have inherient dhampire skills only. I [b]must[/b] feed on blood, my bite is not a pleasant one. Other then being able to read minds and see in the dark, I have no other skills which to defend myself with. I am very sneaky and use stealth a lot for my kills but still. Vampires are faster then me, their eyes can track my movements dispite the fact they may appear as a blur to mortals.<br>
<br>
Like my shoulder length red hair? Well its nice and all but you know red heads are bitchy and pale skin with the side effect of being able to sunburn easy. I'm no exception and seeing as how I'm part vampire, I burn even easier. However I can correct that with sunblock and a leather coat. Still it has me at a disavantage for though I am a daywalker, I still get burned. However I'll never burst into flames unless lit on fire.<br>
<br>
Which brings out another point I would like to make and that is I am half mortal. I can be killed in the same manner they can just you will have to work for it if your the one who tries to be my death. I come down with colds, can be burned, killed with stakes or other weapons. Dismemberment works as well for I can not grow back any missing limbs. Any method you would use to kill a mortal would work on me as well, just not as easy. I can be harmed by physical or mental attacks and I inherited all dhampire weaknesses. Its easy to see when you consider it that I am not as strong as a vampire, my weapons and physical skills are my strong points and though it won't be as easy as killing a mortal, I can be killed in multiple fashions as they can. I just consider myself above average over a human and matched with weak vampires who are my main prey.<br>
<br>
Wasn't that interesting? I bet you wished you knew that before I killed you huh. Oh well... its to late to wonder how I beat you but I guess you could say I simply outwitted you. Heh there is a lot about me you do not know. Ah but I got all night and you are such a handsome head, perfect company to for you not interupting me or anything.<br>
<br>
I was born in Russia in 1901 before the first World War. My father was a wealthy political man though as I found out later, he was not my real father. My mother, a lovely woman who I took after in looks, was a wonderful mother. I had one older brother and two younger sisters, sibling rivalry was there but thats all a part of growing up. When I was thirteen, World War One started and my peaceful childhood was shattered. My father was called off to war and had to leave us. The goverment relocated us for our own protection but I don't feel that actually was the case because war found us anyway. Everyone was killed, my mother, my brother and sisters... everyone but me because I was raped and left for dead. Funny thing though, I never died. Instead that near death experience woke the dhampire nature inside me and I fed from the blood of the slain. I hunted down that small army band and in the night, I slayed them all and drank all their blood.<br>
<br>
Imagine if you will for me... a camp filled with over twenty dead men, all ripped to pieces. And there in the midst of them, a small girl dressed in a torn and blood soaked dress, licking the blood off her lips with hunger and hatred in her eyes. Maybe now you can understand were some of my hatred comes from however I could not explain who I was. It was not until the war had ended that I hunted down my father and confronted him as to what I was. I was angry and scared and fathers are suppose to know the answers right? Well he had one... one that filled me with hatred towards all vampires. My lovely mother who never caused anyone harm had been raped and biten by a vampire. My father was not even my real father... and he and mother had known this all along.<br>
<br>
I became a wanderor then, trying to test the limits to my skills, seeing what I was truely capable of. It was during those times that I became a hunter, and developed the habits I have today. I still rush carelessly into fights, I'm reckless and I still kill mortals. My hatred for vampires has never died and it never will until I die. It could have died today with you but you could not get the job done to remove me from this world of hate.<br>
<br>
So what did I do from then till now? Ah well thats simple. World War Two came along around the time that I was developing into a really sinister young woman. Nothing seemed better then to join the German army and develope my skills by killing Jews in the camps. I learned torture skills which I don't have a use for other then its really fun. I learned how to kill someone as slow as possible or as quickly as possible. The men loved me and trained me on fighting hand to hand as well as the use of weapons. After the war though, I had to flee because of my acts against humanity so I fled to Paris France.<br>
<br>
Talk about a hunter's dream. I ended up under the care of another hunter who trained me in the martial arts as well as swords. Vampires were all over and I got to slay quite a few. Some were stronger then others but just like you, they lost their heads and their lives. I can't say I am perfectly successful for some fights I have barely gotten away from with my life. But I have never lost yet... had I... well I'd not be holding your head in my hands right now.<br>
<br>
I grew tired of France after a time and moved here to America were I let myself fall into the american ways. I bought a Ducati cycle, brought along my weapons and opened a gothic pub. Love my russian accent? Well I have managed to keep it and always will for the rest of my life. I've never married, have had no children and trust no one but two people. Those two run help me run my pub and take care of things while I'm out killing vampires. Carla is a doctor and usually takes care of my wounds, and Frank is a body builder, expert in weapons and helps me in that area. Plus he's good in bed and the only guy still alive after sleeping with me.<br>
<br>
I've hardly told you all of my history but your head is starting to smell and I need to go home for a good bath. Sweet dreams my dear vampire... warn the other that I am here... and they are next. Can I tell you a secret? Ah well what the fuck, I will anyway. I wish you had gotten the job done... but you could not. So until the day I meet a vampire that can remove me from this world of misery and hatred... I will feed and kill forever. It could have been my head in your hands but you sucked... heh pardon the pun.
