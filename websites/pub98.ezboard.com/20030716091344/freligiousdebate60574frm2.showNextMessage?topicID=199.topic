Involuntary sterilization or trickery is technically an invasion of someone's liberties, eventhough the end result would be good.  Offering to pay for voluntary sterilization is something that I support 100%.  So what if the donor isn't offering to get the woman off of drugs.  That isn't her mission.  That is like offering to buy groceries for a needy family, and then getting slammed because you aren't providing clothing that they need.  If someone is offering to help in one way, then they shouldn't get slammed for not doing everything in the world to help a person.  I think offering sterilization to these women is a noble gesture.  You are not only saving countless babies from harm and suffering, but you are also saving the woman some extra stress which can make it harder to kick her drug habit.  It is a nice thought to focus entirely on just getting the women off of drugs, but there is no guarantee they would stay off of drugs.  At least this way she would only be harming herself.  Regardless of whether you call addiction a disease or a choice, it still isn't the baby's fault, and they shouldn't have to suffer.  Let's save everyone the heartache and at least offer these women sterilization options.  <br>
<br>
On another note, if all of our healthcare options included birth control in their coverage, then that would also prevent such a high number of crack babies and such.  They'll pay for Viagra so the man could sleep with the woman, but they rarely pay for birth control so the woman can be protected when she is with her Viagra machine.  The reason so many low income women get pregnant is because they can't afford birth control, and those are also the same women who are more likely to turn to drugs.  I know drug use is rampant in all levels of society, but socioeconomics are a huge factor nonetheless.  Birth control coverage would not only save a fortune in health care for unwanted babies, but it would prevent a lot of these druggies from getting knocked up and harming their babies with continued drug use.  <br>

It would be a shame to have a situation that they couldnt change if they chose to get their lives together.<br>
<br>
I think it would be financially better to offer to pay for birth control than to pay for the unwanted pregnancies and foster care for brain injured children from druggie moms.  Ethically, I would be happy that these children would not have to be concieved and born by mothers who care nothing for them to the point of injuring them. <br>

I think it's a great idea as long as it is voluntary. That's the key. I also agree that it's unfair to slam anyone providing birth control services or incentives. You can't solve someone else's drug addiction, but you can help them stop making fragile babies that they can't even take care of in the first place.<br>

I thought health departments offered low-cost birth control for the poor.<br>

And you can be pretty sure, a lot of the money paid to the women for sterilization is used to buy more drugs. Drugs in society lead to more than just unwanted babies. Overall, I guess I don't mind the idea of sterilization so much but I wish that our country had a more comprehensive way to deal with drugs.<br>

<br>
There can be safeguards in place that make sure the money is going directly to the doctors or clinics providing birth control or sterilization.  We have an audit client that helps low income families pay for rent and utilities, and one year my boss found a check to an apartment complex that was washed, and the person cashed it at the liquor store.  Our client did a total overhaul of the process once this was discovered.  Now they make sure the landlord is getting the checks, and not the liquor stores.  A program for BC/sterilization can pay doctors and clinics directly so the money doesn't end up in the hands of the druggies.  If an organization was to just blindly hand the money to the drug addict, then they may as well give up because they would just be contributing to the problem.  I'm sure there would be some screw ups, but a responsible organization would follow through, and if they were to receive federal funds within their organization, then they would need to run a tight ship anyway.<br>

Actually she would only give the money to them after they brought her a note form the Dr. Most of the women chose to have permant sterilization done. That is the only part I don’t agree with just because they aren’t in the right mind to make such a long-term decision. Then again they aren’t in the right frame of mind to have a baby.<br>

Honestly though, I think after a certain number of babies born with drug addictions and yeah I think the women should be sterilized. TO me, repeated offenses like that would amount to child abuse akin to molestation and rape. BUT, as much as I think it should be done I would never support a law that would order it done. My worry would be once you let the government in where would it stop. <br>

<br>
I figured the money for the sterilization would go straight to the doctor, but I read the last sentence as she was giving money straight to the woman as well. (Ie: I'll give you a 100 dollars if you go get fixed.) As I said, the sterilization itself doesn't bother me too much (so long as the government isn't ordering it) but giving the women money for it does because it seems like it may cure one symptom of the problem (bring drug addicted babies into the world so they can be neglected) and yet at the same time, it perpetuates the original problem (the drug addiction) by giving the woman money, which likely will buy more drugs.<br>
<br>
But maybe I read it wrong???<br>

I guess then you are technically giving this woman drug money to get sterilized, but on the other hand, their won't be a child involved who could be hurt.  I was thinking that they could give them another incentive like a grocery store certificate, but that may not sound quite as appealing to these women.  I guess it is up to these women to do what they wish with their money as long as they can't hurt anymore children.  If you think about it, having kids makes them qualify for welfare, and that money could be used for drugs as well.  Women also resort to other measures for getting drugs, such as sex, and that could lead to more babies.  I hate the idea of handing them drug money, but I guess it is better than the alternative.<br>
