<br>
Look at it this way.<br>
<br>
You grew up with another person. That person lied, cheated whatever. Now you both are grown and that person has children of their own. Those children are sweet wellbehaved children, do you still hold against them the mistakes their parent has made? Their father once broke your favorite toy because you did not give it to him when he demanded it. Do you hold their child responsible for that broken toy? I wouldn't, because that child is not their parent.<br>
<br>
Even if there was an Adam and Eve , why should we be held responsible for their actions and deeds? It seems very vengeful and hateful for a God that is supposidely loving and kind. <br>
<br>
Which brings to mind another question. Do you (anyone) feel that man in naturally ammoral, or even evil? Atheists, do you think man is naturally good? neutrual? evil? <br>
<br>
Is a child damned from the start because of their inhereted sinful nature? Or is that damnation bestowed upon them when they turn 18 and are therefore an adult? At what point does the innocence of a child become the evilness of the adult?<br>

One of the LDS articles of faith is that we believe men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.<br>
<br>
We also believe that Christ &quot;saved&quot; us from the fall with his atonement.  We believe everyone will be resurrected whether they accept Jesus or not, He gave that to everyone as a gift.<br>
<br>
We believe that we existed as spirits with God before being born here and that we all chose to follow him and chose to come to come here to mortality in order to progress.  Therefore, spiritually, whether they are able to follow through on this or not once they are in mortality and subject to temptation, we all get here inherently good from the start, it's just a matter of whether we improve further upon ourselves and help and love each other along while we are here.  Remember that LDS have  a broader view of salvation and we believe everything we make of ourselves here stays a part of who we are after we die.<br>

The concept of original sin makes no sense to me. For example, pro-life Catholics talk about the &quot;innocent unborn&quot; yet turn around and insist that newborns be baptised to be &quot;washed of their original sin.&quot; So, are they innocent or are they sinful? Does our &quot;sinful nature&quot; manifest at conception, or birth? <br>
<br>
This is what happens when we apply dogma instead of logic. <br>
<br>
So, if God created us and we are inherently sinful, wouldn't that mean that God created sin? If so, then how can he be against it?<br>

I don't see how anyone could look at a beautiful baby and think they are full of sin. Nonesense! But then again, we don't believe in baptizing babies. They are so pure and innocent. We wait and baptize children at the age of 8...the age of accountability.<br>
We also look at the &quot;fall&quot; of Adam and Eve as necessary and as part of the &quot;plan.&quot; <p>Paige<br>

I don't believe in original sin either, simply because it does not make sense to me that a loving God would punish us or hold us accountable for the sins of someone else.  I see a newborn baby as totally innocent, not someone in need of spiritual cleansing.  As to man's nature, I guess I would just say that while we are born innocent, we are all imperfect beings with free will and the ability to make mistakes and choose to do wrong, which we all do.  <br>
<br>
I actually don't believe in the Adam and Eve story or the &quot;fall.&quot;  I see this as a strictly metaphorical narrative about creation and our imperfection.  Though many see this belief as imperative to Christianity, there are quite a few of us &quot;non-literalists&quot; out there who believe that the Bible is mainly a book of narratives about the nature of God and His relationship to man, written from man's experiences.  From a logical perspective, this is the only way I can look at it and still claim a faith, as there are errors and contradictions in the Bible.  I certainly don't claim to have all (or any) of the answers, a lot of what I believe is just what feels right to me, as I'm sure many people, religious and non-religious, could say.  <br>
<br>
I thought about posting some of these thoughts on the other thread debating beliefs, but I don't think I have the energy to go around in circles right now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Actually, my grandmother who is catholic told me the reason why she believes in baptising babies was for this reason &quot;what God has given us, we give back to him&quot; I kinda like that idea though from my catholic upbringing I don't believe that's Church doctrine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

Heidi - is our spirits decide to come here to progress, is that a type of reincarnation? The soul keeps coming back to go further along?<br>
<br>
DL - No actually God created us with a mind of our own, so Adam and Eve used their free will to disobey God's one command &quot;don't eat the fruit&quot; and then God cast them out. And NOW we are all sinful. I don't know about the rest of you, but the quickest way to get my child to do something is to say &quot;don't&quot;, you would think God was smarter then that, but I guess not....UNLESS he actually WANTED them to eat it...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We had started a debate months ago on BC about the flaws inherent with the Myth of the Fall, but I had to drop out for school (of all the weak reasons!)  Essentially, I was using it as another proof that the War Santa was nonexistant or not worth worshipping.  The reasoning went like this:<br>
<br>
1. War Santa is all knowing and all powerful.<br>
2. War Santa gives tests of his creations knowing full well they will pass or fail.<br>
3. War Santa then punished his toys for doing what he knew they would.<br>
4. War Santa then <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>inequitably</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> distributed that punishment between equally failing minions.<br>
<br>
Women got shafted in the fall.  How big a set-up is putting a giant tree in the middle of the garden, saying to eat of it would make them knoledgable like War Santa (all we need now is a tree of life ands we can be war gods too!) then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>forbid</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> them to go there.  &quot;You can have everything <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>except</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> this.&quot;  Just how much psychology can War Santa have if he doesn't get this basic part?  OF COURSE THEY WANTED TO CHECK IT OUT!<br>
<br>
It was all a set up.  Eve was framed.  Then women were discriminated against (and still are today) because of this bunk.<br>

Sin is absolutist.  Say &quot;Yahweh be cursed!&quot; and that's it, you burn.  Drop an ear of corn on a golden Ox altar and you're damned.  Have wool socks on with cotton jeans and you get the down escalator ride.  Eat swine and you are unclean.  Gather wood on the wrong day (even if you are of a faith that says it is ok to do so) and be slaughtered by the minions of the War Santa with the quick and painless method of throwing rocks at you till you die.  Presume not to bear fruit out of season and be cursed for eternity and killed instantly.  Tie your left shoe first with your right hand on an even numbered Wednesday and ride the brimstone express. (OK, the last one was an exaggeration.)<br>
<br>
Karma takes far more weight into why something was done and the total of your development results in the direction and elevation of your next incarnation.  Kinda neat, still bunk, but fun.  Plus, you get to do it over and over improving until you reach perfection, while xians just get one grab at the brass ring or fall into the pit for eternity.<br>

<br>
How can we be declared guilty for something Adam did thousands of years ago? Many feel it isn’t right for God to judge us because of Adam’s sin. Yet each of us confirms our solidarity with Adam by our own sins each day. We are made of the same stuff and are prone to rebel, and we are judged for the sins we commit. Because we are sinners, it isn’t fairness we need – it’s mercy.<br>
<br>
On the day of judgement, God won’t be saying to us, “Adam sinned, so you are going to pay for it.” We are responsible for our own sins, not the sins of others.<br>
<br>
However we are affected by Adam’s sin. Adam was sinless, perfect, and good (Gen. 1:31). He had a “good” nature. But, after the fall, he became a sinner. Since we are his children, we inherit his sinful nature (Romans 5:12). It is in this sense that we suffer for what Adam did, that is, he caused his descendants to have sinful natures and all of us suffer because of it.<br>
<br>
Why would God place a tree in the garden and then forbid Adam to eat from it? God wanted Adam to obey, but God gave Adam the freedom to choose. Without choice, Adam would have been like a prisoner, and his obedience would have been hollow. The two trees provided an exercise in choice, with rewards for choosing to obey and sad consequences for choosing to disobey.<br>

8 is not a magic number just a time when kids can choose to be baptized.<br>
<br>
the beauty of it all is that we don't have to decide what is valid or not.  if a kid sticks his foot out of the water thus not being baptized by imersion is he going to hell?  if a kid is baptized out of peer pressure does he need to be re-baptized later when he figures out the significance of the ordinance?  if...<br>

<br>
But sin is a xian invention.  I do not sin each day, I confirm no solidarity.  Where can you quantify a sin outside of the bibble?  What ethical measure can you apply?  Selfishness?  Selfserving?  Relative harm done?  Why is it a sin to admire an attractive person simply for their being attractive?  Yet the bibble would have us condemed for thinking &quot;wow, nice butt.&quot;  If you don't cheat on your husband because you don't want him to cheat on you, thats selfish, e.g. serving your self interests.  Is that sinful?  Then how do the patriarchs in the bible have multiple wives?  Did they not look and think &quot;wow, nice butt.&quot; yet not sin because they married her?<br>
<br>
If adam was indeed &quot;sinless, perfect, and good&quot; then he would not have failed the test god gave him.  He was inherently flawed.  Apparently by design if god was who created him.<br>
<br>
The argument of Free Will fails in conjunction with Omniscience.  If he knows all, he knows how we will do on the tests.  Therefore if we fail a test, it is because he gave us one he knew we'd fail and could have just as easily given us one we could pass.  The man who was stoned to death gathering sticks on the sabbath, I would wager his last thoughts were along the lines of &quot;Ow! Ow! Ow!&quot; not &quot;Forgive me father for I have sinned.&quot;  So the men who killed him robbed him of his chance at salvation by not permitting him to reflect and repent, condeming him to hell and costing god a soul.  The same can be said of Job's children and household.  They were all slaughtered on a bet with the devil.  Twice. How fair is that?  Where is their chance to repent?  Nice plan big G.<br>
<br>
Sin remains a judeo xian invention that serves as a marketing tool.  Murder is a sin, but if you are attacked and defend yourself to the attackers death, have you sinned?  Turn the other cheek or eye for an eye?  Is it ok as long as they are Philistines?<br>
<br>
It is all bunk.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Heidi - is our spirits decide to come here to progress, is that a type of reincarnation? The soul keeps coming back to go further along?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, souls do not keep coming back, but we believe we existed in spirit before being born and joining with a body.        I believe that it was necesary to enter in to mortality like this in order to progress more.  We do not believe we would all be living in &quot;the garden&quot; if it weren't for Adam and Eve, we don't believe anyone would have been born there.  We believe that the fall was necesary to bring about the &quot;mortal state&quot; of things.  So Adam and Eve set the ball rolling.  So, because of Adam and EVe we are mortal and subject to temptation, but this is a good thing, God knew it needed to happen.  Frankly, I think using words like &quot;punishment&quot; and &quot;sin&quot; doesn't really reflect the actually concept of what happened.  To me, original sin doesn't mean that all people are born bad, it just means we are born mortal and capable of making mistakes.  But, you know, mortal language is not always that great a way to communicate concepts, know what I mean?  And in the end, even if it was inspired by God, once a mortal writes it down it is in his imperfect langauge and being read by other people who are imperfect at interpreting it and there you go <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I think Karma as DBC explained it is actually pretty close to how we (at least I) think because it is more qualitative, like the post I put somewhere here about how it's about what we become not a checklist of dos and don'ts.  I think instructions or guidelines would convey the meaning better than commandments, you know, Heavenly Father's way of trying to point us in the direction of the things that will help us learn and grow and warning us about the things that will hurt ourselves and others.  He didn't just make up random hoops for people to jump through, which I think is how it seems to some.  There is always some deeper principle behind it.<br>

Every child is born on what is called the &quot;fitra&quot;, the natural path, straight way, whatever you want to call it.  We all start out the same, it is only our environment/parents/etc. that change the natural course our lives would have taken.  Instinctively a baby seeks that which gives pleasure, the smile of a parent, a warm embrace.  I think it is generally agreed that children who take pleasure in things like torturing animals, etc. have suffered some kind of abuse or other traumatic event which causes them to behave this way.  The precociousness of children is not due to an inherent evil (which is how one born-again Christian explained the presence of Original Sin to me), but innocent mischievousness, testing the limits, etc.<br>
<br>
I don't know whether you'd consider Islam as a faith with bases in the Torah, but although we believe in the existence of Adam and Eve and the Fall, our version of the story isn't the same as the standard Judeo-Christian one.<br>
<br>
There's a story/saying/tradition (&quot;hadith&quot;) where Moses and Adam are talking, and (paraphrasing) Moses says, &quot;So what's up with that whole Fall thing, why did you ruin it for the rest of us by getting kicked out of Paradise?&quot; and Adam replied, &quot;Don't get mad at me, it was my destiny.&quot;<br>
