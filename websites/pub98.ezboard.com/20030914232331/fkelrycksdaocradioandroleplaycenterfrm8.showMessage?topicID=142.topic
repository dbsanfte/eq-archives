Misadventures of Simon Peter</span><hr size=1> Part 1:  The Unexpected Gift<br>
<br>
A wailing could be heard throughout the hog farmstead beside the monastery.<br>
<br>
Brother McHearn looked up from his study.  ‘What is God’s sweet name was that??’<br>
He jumped to his feet and ran to the stained glass window, only to peer out through a myriad of color to the pasture.  Nothing looked amiss in dawn’s early glow, but surely he was not hearing things.  He grabbed up his robe and pulling it about himself he ran down the rough hewn stone stairway and out into the fields.<br>
<br>
The sound was startling.  Generally the monastery was quiet as the brother’s took a very solemn oath of silence.  He knew that if the sound persisted he would receive reports of the likes of “Banshee’s broke my study!” , “Evil is abroad in the sanctuary, Father!”, and of course “Screams like that!  Can only come from eating Ye’ Ole’ Taco Bell.”  He’d have a stack of papyrus three measures high on his mahogany desk to sort through and turn into the Main Branch of the Diocese in Camelot.. And those Bishops can be soooo stuffy.<br>
<br>
He saw a small bundle in the middle of the corral, and several newly awakened hogs eying it tentatively.  He knew if he didn’t get to it, whatever IT was, then there’d be a quick breaking-of-fast for the piggies.<br>
<br>
He jumped the wooden fence that kept the swine from becoming strays, hence leading to yet another stack of reports, and muttered the Friar’s version of an obscenity (Big fat pink clouds and midgets with fire-setting tendancies!) when he realized he forgot to don his slippers, and plunged ankle deep into mud and other less pleasant things one can find in a sty.<br>
<br>
Wading through the… uhm.. muck, he came to the bundle and picked it up.  Unwrapping it he looked upon the infant face of a boy, blonde haired and blue eyed, and coincidentally, large mouthed, which explained the vast amount of screaming.  Not knowing what to do and having absolutely zero experience in this sort of  “fatherhood”, he replaced the wrapping over the child’s face to muffle the cries and trodded back to the carved granite abbey.<br>
<br>
He quickly made his way through the gate and set the package, (now thankfully quieting down!) on the ground.  He looked up to the resident hunchback in the bell tower and made a series of gestures.  His right hand tugged his right earlobe twice.  His left hand grabbed at the end of his nose.  The right elbow waved in front of him in a circular motion while he hopped about of his left foot and spit.  Twice.  He could see the misshapen figure wave from its vantage point acknowledging the command.  As the friar scooped his burden back into his arms, the large brass bell rang clearly across the air one time, signaling a King’s Friar’s Convention, of KFC as they affectionately referred to it.  Making his way inside and to the washroom, Brother McHearn thought ‘There really has to be an easier way to dictate that the bell should ring once, and once only.”<br>

(Not Accustomed to Assembling-for-other-than-prayers-or-meals Committee Perplexed!)<br>
<br>
The assembly met in the great hall nearly an hour later, the rustling of robes and the screeching of wooden chair legs scraping the floor the only sounds made, as they all seated themselves in front of the platform.<br>
<br>
Brother McHearn strode in carrying a freshly washed bundle and made his way to the platform.  Setting the bundle down on a podium erected for any theological dissertation, he pulled out a white-washed plank and a charcoal pencil and began to scribble..<br>
<br>
“I am sure you all have questions and hopefully, I can answer them with God’s help.  We have a situation here unheard of in the history of this Monastery.” (Hey! It’s a BIG plank..)  He held it up over his head and watched everyone nod when they were done reading.  He took a rag, wiped it down, and again began scribbling.<br>
<br>
“In my studies this morning I heard a wailing from the field, and BEHOLD! I found this!” he held the sign up quickly, and set it back down, picking up the baby and holding it above his head.  A friar in the back row picked up a board from under his seat and began scribbling furiously, he held up his sign and Brother McHearn squinted at it;<br>
<br>
“…… ……… …   …… .. ..”<br>
<br>
Sighing, McHearn put the baby down and erased his own board and wrote,<br>
“What?? I can’t hear you from here.”<br>
<br>
The other friar erased his board and wrote even larger;<br>
“I wasn’t done reading”<br>
<br>
After squinting for what seemed a short eternity, Brother McHearn nodded and  started scribbling on his own board;<br>
“I said, My studies were interrupted.. Bah!” and held it over his head again, clearly frustrated.<br>
<br>
“No more silence for a quarter of an hour!  It’s a baby!”  the sound of his voice went across the assembly gathered and hit them like thunder.  He broke the uncomfortable silence with unethical behavior then proceeded to lift the baby again over his head knocking the plank from it’s precarious perch on the pedestal (try saying that 5 times fast) to the floor with a resounding clatter, which in turn, awoke the sleeping baby who started it’s wailing anew!<br>
<br>
Chaos came to the sanctuary and made itself comfy in the grand hall with the friars assembled there.  Voices unused for years began to speak out and what resulted was a cacophony of tumultuous noise that could wake the dead, which they later decided would be a much easier way to perform resurrections.  Chaos’ only complaint?  Not enough color.. Brown robes were so unfashionable now a days.<br>

<br>
Deep within the monasteries library lay a piece of worn parchment rolled tight into a scroll.  It had been there ever since the monastery was built in 72 A.D.  Contained in the scroll was a prophecy.  The first translation of this scroll hung in the great hall over the dias to remind them of the higher purpose they were all to take part in.  Every brother in the abbey had committed this prophecy to memory as it helped them to maintain their faith knowing the Lord was sending them help.  It was their first duty upon entering the ranks of friar, or acolyte.  It was a cornerstone of their daily life.  They often stopped to gaze upon it again and again during daily meditation,  It fulfilled them and gave them a little insight into the Maker’s Divine Plan.<br>
<br>
It read:<br>
“And He shall come from the swine, covered in offal.  And ye shall name him in honor of the Water walking disciple, and He shall bring light into Camelot, yea’ even to the ends of all Avalon.  And ere’ His arrival, and the great Revival that will surge forth, ye’ shall all live reminding one another to be celibate, in honor of all the Lord is given’ ye’.”<br>
<br>
A short prophecy, but clearly stated, and none had ever doubted it’s great importance.  It was clear.  This was the child spoken about in the instructive words.  This was the child of prophecy, and the Lord had finally seen fit to place Him in their care.  They decided then at that assembly to raise him up in the ways of a friar, and to award him the name:<br>
Simon Peter.<br>
<br>
*Later that eve Brother Hearn strode about the halls of the abbey and made his way down to the library, his favorite place to spend time in prayer with his Father.  He decided to carefully search out the original scroll (being one of the only people that could still read the original archaic) and to hold it and read it reverently.  He enjoyed times like this.  His whole life had been dedicated towards the preparation of what was now here.<br>
<br>
Pulling the scroll down from a shelf in the back he blew the dust off it’s surface.  The parchment itself had grown brittle and thin.  He held it lovingly, as he would a tankard of fine ale (he IS a friar after all.) and cradled it close to him.  Moving underneath the glow of a oil lantern, he read each word slowly, one at a time a broad smile on his face, and the love of God in his heart..<br>
<br>
Hours later, the sound of Brother Hearn weeping could still be heard if one went close enough to the library.  He continued to sob through the night and kept gazing upon the last line of the prophecy through puffy, red, tear filled eyes..<br>
<br>
“And ere’ His arrival, and the great Revival that will surge forth, ye’ shall all live reminding one another to CELEBRATE, in honor of all the Lord is given’ ye’.”<br>

<br>
“The young lad grew,<br>
as young lads do,<br>
Becoming a man,<br>
Of fifteen hands span!<br>
And strong as a ox,<br>
With a huge, giant co---“ The singsong voice abruptly stopped as the staff came across the back of his head.  The young acolytes gathered, gasped at the actions of the seemingly ancient friar. <br>
Brother McHearn placed his staff back on the wall behind him and shook his head solemnly as he called healing blessings down on the flamboyantly adorned and recently rendered unconscious minstrel.  ‘Why’ he thought to himself ‘must those of the story tellin’ art be forever cursed to moments of stupidity?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I shall be’ tellin’ the story of young Simon Peter’s growth myself then!” he declared casting one last disgusted look at the minstrel.  Since he was at the Diocese Recruitment Academy Boarding house (or D.R.A.B.) as he was so fond of thinking of it, the laws of silence didn’t stand here.<br>
He began the story;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You see, we had no idea how to raise this young pup of a Briton.  For two days he cried and hollered and screamed as we tried to find a way to keep em’ fed.  We had been drippin’ milk into his maw but it seemed it was never enough fer’ young Simon, he was a hungry boy indeed!  Just when we thought he may waste away, Brother Taylor came up with an idea that none of us dimwits had thought of afore’.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He took one of his thickly woven gloves and cut a small slit into the end of it and filled it with lambs milk he did!  The glove would then feed it slowly into the mouth of the babe. It was ingenious!  The glove has since been a church relic and cast in gold, and in honor, Brother Taylor received a “Golden Glove Award” for having the deep insight to feed God’s chosen one..”<br>
As Brother McHearn continued he found himself recalling the memories vividly and it all played out in a picture in his mind.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The days of Simon’s infancy to the earliest years of his study in the Theology and the art of Staff wielding.  Years passed in his minds eye to that time and he recounted the time.  Simon proved to be a extremely fast learner in the ways of the written Word, but proved less than desirable in the art of self defense.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sun shone down on the hillside between the Monastery and Humberton and caught in it’s rays two brown robed people walking slowly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You see Simon, the staff becomes an extension of your own person.  Think of it as part of you.  Be the staff Simon, be the Staff!”  he pointed down the jade colored hillside to a black wolf cub.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “See that beasty there Lad?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Simon’s blonde hair shook uncontrollably as he nodded an affirmative to the elder friar, and threw a lopsided grin McHearns way.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Go and smite it!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The boy looked up at him perplexed. “Smite it Sir?” he asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes boy!” the friar responded turning his own staff about it figure eights and bludgeoning the air about him wickedly. “Like that, go forth and smite it!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well.. Ok..” Simon, now a lad of 8 years, took up his staff uncertainly and began down the hillside towards the rather large and vicious wolf.  On the way down his imagination built a fiendish image in his mind.  Snarling and growling the wolf looked at him hungrily and raised its hackles towards him threateningly, long strands of saliva dripping from it’s blood soaked jaws.  He looked at the pup a moment before he ran back up to the elder friar.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “But Sir.. He’s dangerous!  He’d make a meal out of me!” the boy protested, looking frightened for his young life.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brother McHearn blinked looking at the little wolf pup sitting calmly on it’s haunches licking it’s paw.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Um.. Yes, I suppose he COULD be dangerous, but I am here to offer thee my protection.  Now go forth and commence with the smitage!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Simon now disheartened trudged back down the hillside until he came within only feet of his dreaded enemy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Friar watched his young charge approach the young pup who stood up playfully panting at the lads arrival.  But that’s not how Simon saw it;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The black wolf again became aware of his attackers presence and growled low and gnashed it’s wicked fangs in the air.  It’s red eyes stared deep into Simon’s soul, and the boy new fear, true fear.  He raised his staff behind his head in a basic stance and proceded to strike forth at the wolf.  His first swing flew high and he decided to try the figure eight manuvere.  Closing the distance between himself and the mortal foe in front of him he swung the staff around with all his might and connected!  With his forehead!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dazed and stunned the boy knew he had erred and the enemy would soon be upon him.  He cried out for help and felt the pups talons dig into his shoulders and it’s weight press upon him.  The last thing he felt was the heat of the rancid breath of the foul creature on his cheek as he slipped into unconciousness and dreamed of being eaten alive.  He cried out in his recent sleep.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Help, he eating me.. he’s eating.. me..”  the prone form made a bunch of gurgling noises as Brother McHearn ran to his side.   Simon was in trouble indeed!  The young wolf was nearly licking him to death.  Barely containing a chuckle, the Father lifted the young puppy off his protégé and shoo’d him away.  He knelt by Simon and shook him back to awareness.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What happened.. Did I win?” as Simon sat up blood rushed from the fresh cut on his head into his eye.  He realized then all his mortal wounds were real and he was dying.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m.. “ he gasped for his last breath “Dying.. I’m sorry Father!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yer’ not dyin’ Lad!” the friar exclaimed as he pulled a long wicked splinter from the boys forehead “at worst, ye’d have administered yourself a “staff infection.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp McHearn briefly spoke words of healing over his pupil and they headed back to the Monastery. And back to the vow of silence. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And that lads, is where the great Simon Peter found himself at your very age.  So, do you wish this life of the monastery for yer’self?  If you’re destined to follow in his footsteps, then accompany me back.  Get yer’ things together and let’s get moving.”  He wrapped up his story and several of the young friars made haste to round up their things.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He prayed silently.. O’ Lord give me the strength…<br>
