Peter Gabriel is a musician/singer.  You might remember titles such as 'Sledghammer' and 'Big Time' but he's had a lot more, those were 2 of his really popular ones in the 80's.  I've heard his concerts are really awesome.  In the 70's he was the lead singer of Genesis, Phil Collins now holds that distinction.  (I like him too!)<br>

<br>
Additionally, he has a song on the soundtrack to the kids movie &quot;The Wild Thornberry's&quot; called Animal Nation.  A very interesting song that came about when he was working with bonobo apes and discovered their affinity to music.  Apparently when one would play a note on a keyboard, another would search for a note that harmonized with the one the other was playing.  Kind of cool.<br>
<br>
The concert itself was just incredible.  He got two standing ovations before he ever played a note.  The crowd applauded for about 3 or 4 minutes when he came on stage to introduce the opening act - very classy that he does that, very few artists do that anymore.  The opening act was great.  Her name is Savara and she is a singer from Uzbekistan.  This very petite, young Asian woman (about 26 years old, I think) had the most incredible voice.  Rich, powerful and perfect.<br>
<br>
He then came on stage for his own set, and was greeted by another 3 or 4 minute standing ovation.<br>
<br>
He then played for about 2 hours and 15 minutes straight, without an intermission.  All in all, he played 17 songs, including some of his biggest hits from the past like Sledgehammer, Don't Give Up, Games Without Frontiers, Shock the Monkey and, of course, Solsbury Hill.<br>
<br>
Another very nice thing about Peter Gabriel is that he is a very grounded individual who really cares about his family.  On his first trip through North America last winter he had his wife and young son (about 2 years old, I think) along with him and one of his two older daughters was along to do a video documentary of the tour.  Additionally, his other daughter, Melanie, was his main backup vocalist for both tours.  Seeing father and daughter sing the very moving Don't Give Up to each other was a highlight last night.<br>
<br>
I also respect that Peter Gabriel has said quite vehemently that he has never and will never use drugs.  Now, the reason given is that he has said the stuff in his mind is strange enough as it is without any outside influence, and anyone who has heard some of his earlier work with Genesis can attest to that.  However, I still respect him for holding that conviction.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the night was incredible.  Having second row seats in the location I did meant that for most of the night he was never more than 20 feet away, and often within 10.  He still has an incredible voice, very rich and emotional.<br>
<br>
He plays the last show of the tour in Montréal tonight.  I have been so tempted all day to get in my car and drive there.  It's too late now, considering the time, but it was tempting.<br>
<br>
It was a great show and one I will never forget. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

Primarily used for hockey, it sits a maximum of about 9 or 10 thousand for a concert.  There were probably only 6,000 or so at the show though.  It really wasn't publicized well in the area and his new CD, while very good, is not what you would call radio friendly.  Most of the songs are about seven minutes long and don't have the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus to end format.  Unless it's one of the college stations in the area, if your music isn't formulaic, it won't get played.<br>
