And also who have been exhaustively helpful in getting me up to speed on Plots, Characters and the City in general.  I would not have even attempted to be the new Storyteller if it were not for their support.  They have done an amazing job of keeping this game afloat and fun for everyone.<br>
<br>
Now, about me.<br>
As a long time Game Master, and one of the first to run the 1st Edition Vampire LARP here in Santa Cruz, I wanted to introduce myself, explain a few things, and perhaps even answer some of your questions before they are asked.<br>
First off, my name is Gerry.  Some of you will hear me referred to as Raven.  I am a member of the SCA and a heavy fighter.  Raven is my persona name and my friends, over the years, have come to call me by that in and out of the SCA.  I will respond to either name.  Please know that I am not unapproachable.  I try to maintain an open door policy when I run a game, but sometimes, as you all know, Game gets hectic.  Please bear with me on those occasions when I am not available.  I will always try to get to you and your questions, concerns or comments in a timely fashion.<br>
To answer some questions before they are asked, I will put forth a short Q &amp; A session.<br>
<br>
Q: Why you as the new Storyteller?<br>
A:  Easy answer.  Marisa and I are married.  Scott is our housemate.  I have been hearing them talking about the game for the past year.  Once regular babysitting became available, I decided to start playing.  I found that I really missed gaming in general and the release that it provides.  When Scott began to get burnt out, I offered to take over as Storyteller.  The first LARP I ran was for 60 players twice a week for 6 months.  I had two narrators and it ran nearly flawlessly.  I have been a game master for almost 20 years and I feel that I can run this game (with all of its disparate players) with an ease and familiarity with which a lot of former storytellers did not possess.  Now, I am not here to toot my own horn, or stroke my own ego.  I know what my strengths and weaknesses are as a gamer, and my real strength lies in my Storytelling ability.<br>
<br>
Q: Will you be a Power Storyteller and throw Uber-tough NPCs into the game to stroke your Ego?<br>
A:  No.  Some previous Storytellers have used their power to play God and lord it over the players.  That is not the point to this game.  I emphasize the word GAME.  The Storyteller is there to provide plots and interactions for the Players.  Not to amuse himself with how creative he is or to play a 5th Generation super vampire capable of crushing the city with a careless gesture of his right eyebrow.  I am a firm believer in running the game for the Players.  To entertain those who want to partake in my vision of the game.  This is not to say that I will not throw a few monsters into the game when they are warranted, but NPCs are a tool to further the game, not control it.<br>
<br>
Q:  How do you like your games to run?<br>
A:  As smoothly as possible.  While there will always be hiccups and problems when a group of individuals get together, I try to maintain as fair a standard as possible.  Now, with that said, let me clarify what kind of Storyteller I am.  I strive to make the game enjoyable for everyone.  I try to include plots, NPCs, and story lines that include all of the Player characters in some way.  I work hard to not exclude characters from the game.  If you feel neglected, tell me.  By the same token, I cannot be expected to make someone the “star of the show”.  This is a collaborative effort, and there are no lead roles.  Everyone counts.  Now, I take a firm hand in running my game and I do not tolerate many a thing that has happened with previous Storytellers.  I do not cater to whiners.  I do not play favorites.  I do not like to see Meta gaming, although I know it will happen I will call people on it.  I do like to see “Role-playing”.  That is the heart of this game.  I reward those that stay in character, develop their plots and play in game.  I penalize those that try to cheat the system.  It’s called balance.  I’m very good at maintaining this balance.  Remember, I’m not here to be a bad guy.  I’m here to entertain.  But I cannot entertain effectively if players are doing their own thing.  My story.  My rules.  Sounds a little harsh, I know, but it is the reality of dealing with a diverse player base.<br>
<br>
Q:  Will you be appointing Narrators?  Do you need Narrators?<br>
A:  Yes and No.  I run a pretty tight plot and I must be the one in control of the outcome of certain situations.  I will be appointing Rules Arbiters rather than Narrators.  The Rules Arbiters will only be there to provide technical support, so to speak.  If you have a question about how a rule/discipline/ability/etc… is supposed to work, then go to an Arbiter.  This leaves me free to focus on the plot and players.  I will back the Arbiters up in their decisions on how something is supposed to work, however, that decision can be brought to me for appeal or clarification.  I will also be asking players, on occasion, to play NPCs for me.  They will not be Narrators as such, but will have certain info that they can use to help answer questions.  Again, I am the final answer to any questions.<br>
<br>
Q:  Can players create their own plots?<br>
A:  Yes.  However, the plot must be run past me (with plenty of advance notice) and I will actually run the plot.  The players are there to play and create the heart of the game.  My job is to keep it all balanced and focused.  Again, I must be the one in control of what happens in the overall plot.  This does not mean that Players cannot plot in character to do things, but if it impacts the game in a major way, I need to know about it.  There are no secrets from the Storyteller.<br>
<br>
Q:  Will you change the house rules or add any new rules?<br>
A:  Probably.  Every Storyteller is different.  I can not say with absolute certainty that I will not change something; however, I do not plan to make any changes as of right now.  <br>
<br>
Q:  Will you keep the Santa Carla by Night web site up?<br>
A:  Yes.  I like having a forum to chat out of game and I enjoy reading the Literary posts that the Players write.  I would like to add here that no matter how gifted a writer you are, the Literary posts are not a replacement for Live Gaming.  Literaries don’t get you EEPs (unless it is spectacular writing), but they do help me understand the characters better and provide me with much appreciated ammo for creating subplots for characters.<br>
<br>
Q: Will there be combat in your game?<br>
A:  Yes.  What is the World of Darkness without a little blood shed?  I will not run combats every week, but there should be enough to keep the populace’s blood lust sated.<br>
<br>
If you have more questions (as I’m sure you will), please either ask them here, or see me at game.<br>
