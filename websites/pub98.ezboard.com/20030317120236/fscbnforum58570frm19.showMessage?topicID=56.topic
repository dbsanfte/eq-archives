It would never be enough to stop Jason Black, of course, but that no longer mattered. <br>
<br>
He walked to his desk and dropped his satchel. The item he had recovered from Mr. Roche’s office slid out of the bag and onto the cold, obsidian surface of the desk. Crowley sat down, and absent-mindedly began drumming his fingers. He surprised himself that he did not automatically turn to his computer and begin typing. He reasoned that the reason for this was that the best answer to all of his problems, the one thing that could set right everything that had been wrong, was right in front of him, sitting on the desk. <br>
<br>
Crowley slid his fingers across the desk and touched the metal handle. The gun, though old and showing signs of use, was quite smooth and well polished. Mr. Roche had certainly kept his vintage German Luger in excellent condition, both in terms of its appearance, and in retaining its deadly function.<br>
<br>
So many disappointments. So many paths that had shown such promise, and had instead turned to ash. So many opportunities that had been wasted. <br>
<br>
Crowley remembered standing in populace earlier that evening. The mood, overwhelmingly, was a bright and happy one, at least by Kindred standards. For almost everyone present, there was a renewed feeling of hope; that the troubles of the last few weeks were now behind them. <br>
<br>
However, for Crowley, the meeting had simply reaffirmed what he had suspected for some time; history was being rewritten. Never mind the fact that most of the city, including almost all of the Primogen, had been part of the action. Never mind that most of these new city leaders, including the Prince and Seneschal, would never have ascended to their new positions had it not been for that disastrous night when the populace had taken up arms against its so-called Prince. Never mind the fact that the number of Kindred who were unhappy to see Nikke fall from the Prince ship could be counted on one hand. Never mind the fact that praxis was routinely declared in Camarilla cities all over the world without anyone from the Camarilla raising a fuss. <br>
<br>
After Marie – no, no, after Prince Marie had publicly chastised them, their fortunes had sunk about as far as they could without being dead or blood hunted. They were disgraced in the eyes of everyone in the city. After three months of work in this domain, Crowley was worse-off than ever. <br>
<br>
So Crowley was disgraced. <br>
Well, that was no longer relevant.<br>
So Blackmore had stripped him of the position of whip, and instead handed it to a Ventrue who had already shown himself incapable of even controlling his own childe.<br>
This, too, was no longer relevant. <br>
So even his acts on behalf of the city that night, revealing the Giovanni plot to create an army of ghouls and covering up a breach of the Masquerade by some neonate Gangrel, had gone unreported and unacknowledged. <br>
That was no longer relevant. <br>
So he was now further than ever from achieving his goals.<br>
Not relevant. Not anymore. <br>
<br>
What was relevant was that Crowley now had a German Luger -- an old weapon to be sure, but still quite lethal to Kine – in front of him. <br>
<br>
And when such a weapon was loaded with phosphorous rounds, it could be lethal even to Kindred. <br>
<br>
Crowley picked up the weapon, admiring it. During his human life, he had never been especially interested in guns. Once his un-life began, his sire had insisted on training him in firearms.<br>
<br>
“It is, as a rule, always much more preferable to have others do the fighting for us.” His sire had taught him. “We were meant to be rulers. Generals – yes -- that too, certainly. Soldiering, however, is best left to the other clans. But, admittedly, that is not always an option, and one needs to be prepared in the case of an emergency.”<br>
<br>
So Crowley had learned, not only how to use firearms, but how to appreciate them. He appreciated their power, even though they were hardly the most conventional arms used by Kindred. He had learned to appreciate further that even though his Kindred nature might keep a bullet from killing him, it was still something best to be cautious of. <br>
<br>
Contrary to popular opinion in the mortal world, it was actually quite difficult human beings to end their own lives. Well more than 60% of all attempts failed. Poisons and drug overdoses were notoriously unreliable. Few people had the stomach to cut their arteries and bleed to death, and a surprising number who did lacked the medical knowledge to do it right. Bullets to the head were often unreliable; a lot of people who had tried simply ended up causing themselves permanent brain damage. Drops from extreme heights, once again, were notoriously iffy. <br>
<br>
Likewise, it was surprisingly hard for Kindred to end their own lives. Sunlight and fire were certainly lethal, but most Kindred simply frenzied when put in those kinds of situations, and ran for cover. Certainly, one could try running into the wilderness and hoping a lupine took care of it for them, but it was a funny thing about lupines; they never seemed to be around when you actually needed them. If you were feeling truly masochistic, you could always find the nearest Sabbat territory and let them tear you apart – but that simply wasn’t in Crowley’s character. <br>
<br>
An incendiary round straight through the head by way of the mouth, however, ought to be sufficient. <br>
<br>
Crowley unlocked a drawer in his desk and removed a box of bullets. He then opened the clip of the gun and loaded it. No Russian Roulette for him; if he was going to do this, he would do it right. <br>
<br>
Crowley clicked off the safety, and stuck the end of the barrel in his mouth. <br>
<br>
Ironic that he should die at the hands of a Luger. His father had fought in the Great War, after all. Killed a whole bunch of bad Germans, come home with the other boys to parades and the promise of a better life, had taken a wife, and settled into the monotonous life that was American suburbia, with a perfectly acceptable office job, and lived happily ever after.<br>
<br>
Yeah, right. <br>
When Crowley was 11 years old his father had lost his job. His response to this was to take his gun from his army days, drive out to some deserted field, and shoot himself. <br>
<br>
Mother had blamed herself. There was no question of that. Eight miserable months later, young Steven discovered his mother in the bathtub, her wrists slashed. <br>
If she had ever left a note, Crowley never saw it.<br>
<br>
“The greatest successes my parents had was they were both able to kill themselves on their first attempts.” Crowley mused. “If it was somebody else, I might actually find it all amusing in a dark sort of way.” <br>
<br>
The Crowley family had had no living relatives. Steven had been sent first to an orphanage, and then, about a year later, to a mental hospital after an unfortunate incident involving knives and another child. <br>
<br>
Mental hospitals in the early 1960’s were ill suited to actually treat anyone, much less care for a child. Young Steven had spent most of his time with quack psychiatrists trying to get inside his head, being subjected to electronic shocks, and new, experimental medications with questionable side effects. His only escape from this had been his writing, at least when they had given him paper and a pencil. <br>
<br>
He remembered a day when they did not; for fear that he would stab himself. That’s when the attacks started. It had begun with small body-shakings, and had eventually deteriorated into screaming and slamming his head and body against the wall until he was pumped up with more medication than was usually considered advisable even for adults. Steven had slept for three straight days.<br>
<br>
And while he slept, he dreamed.<br>
<br>
He dreamed of being back in the house of his childhood. Of his parents. He dreamed of his father leaving for work, smiling, waving goodbye to Stephen and his mother. He tried to call after his father; tell him not to go, knowing he’d never come home. He turned to his mother, trying to warn her to stop father. But mother was a blank page, as if in a trance like state, looking straight ahead blankly and never looking down at her son pulling at her wrist. And that’s when Steven realized that his hand was bloody, bloody from his mother’s wrists. Steven saw the bloody tears in his mother’s skin run up her arm and body. He looked up to her face, but it was no longer her. Instead the decayed remain of some ghastly hag greeted him, eyes shriveled up to nothing, skin and hair falling out, a nightmare worse than anything he could’ve ever imagined. Steven had screamed, and as he screamed, blood had poured from the walls, a trickle quickly turning into a gush, the floor quickly flooding, and then the house. Mother was swept away in the ocean of blood, and Steven, still screaming, felt himself being drowned. He had started kicking, desperately trying to swim his way to the surface, and he had kept on kicking, since long past the point when he should have died. <br>
<br>
Somehow he made it to the surface, and to air. <br>
And then a switch had gone off.<br>
<br>
When he awoke, Crowley had only one goal: getting out of that place. <br>
<br>
Fortunately, this proved to be surprisingly easy. The hospital’s budget had been cut, and it was under pressure to release patients. Crowley spent a few months telling the so-called doctors everything they wanted to hear and “exhibiting all the behavior of a fully-cured young man, who poses no threat whatsoever to either himself or society”. <br>
<br>
When Crowley was released back into normal society, he pursued his academics with a vengeance. Though he started out behind everyone at his age group, by the time he was 18, Ivy League schools were lining up to offer him scholarships. Attending Harvard had lead to attending Harvard Business School, which had lead to becoming a “whiz kid” Wall Street broker. By that time, he had assumed a huge amount of debt from student loans. <br>
<br>
With the money he made playing the market, Crowley was able to pay it all back in less than a year. <br>
<br>
Eventually, of course, this had all lead to Crowley catching the eye of a mysterious businessman from the west coast who was looking to shore up his operations with some east coast blood – literally. Crowley had been Embraced, and then followed his new boss back to California. <br>
<br>
And somehow, nearly three decades as a vampire had brought him to this. Sitting in his office. In a city that had been told to hate him despite all he had done to fight for it. With the sidearm of his former Prince jammed into his mouth, loaded with incendiary rounds.<br>
<br>
Crowley could appreciate the irony. <br>
<br>
Now it ends. Crowley thought. Now I will finish it on my terms. <br>
So simple. So entirely and devilishly simple. <br>
<br>
Where could this un-life get him, anyway? He wasn’t even at the bottom of the proverbial totem pole. You had to dig the totem pole up and get under the earth, where the parasites scattered to find where he was at: parasite-level. Yes, that was him to a tee. Even if he was able to leave this city, which he couldn’t anymore, what position would he have? The condemnation of the Justicar and of Jason Black may not mean his life, but it would make it damn impossible to advance anywhere in the Camarilla. There would always be political enemies out there who could look up the “Santa Carla incident” and lord it over him. How could any Prince welcome him, once told of that? He and the others were now breakers of the 6th tradition, and all his arguments that Nikke Black was an Anarch, a Diablerist and pawn of the Giovanni, would be worthless. <br>
<br>
Torpor? What good would that do? Even if it gave him a clean slate, he would see what resources he had built scattered and dispersed and younger Ventrue would have moved up, giving him an even taller pillar to crawl up.<br>
<br>
The Sabbat? Please. Even if they took him in, Crowley still had some self-respect left. Anarch? Not his style. Hell, even progressing in the Kine world would be more difficult with the Prince’s insane edict against ghoul creation. <br>
<br>
No, it was simply time for him to embrace the void.<br>
<br>
Mother, father… I join you now. <br>
<br>
Crowley closed his eyes. <br>
<br>
In his mind’s eye, the void beckoned to him. It called him like a moth to a flame. It extended itself – dark tentacles sprouting forth to consume him… <br>
<br>
Oh, that’s the final insult. Crowley thought. It reminds me of the damned Lasom… <br>
<br>
Suddenly, there was light everywhere. The void seemed to burn away, as if God himself had suddenly decided to recreate the world out of the void, and had summoned the light to reveal his creation. <br>
<br>
Crowley could have sworn he was looking straight into the sun. Run. The beast within him demanded. Run away, before we burn! <br>
<br>
But Crowley knew he could never turn away. He simply watched, mesmerized by it. He had, of course, simply taken the sun for granted during his mortal life. He hadn’t thought he had missed it that much since his Embrace, certainly it was an inconvenience not being able to go out during the day, but of course, there were ways around that. Not for one day had he even considered trading his immortality back to look at the sun again with his own eyes. <br>
<br>
Until now. <br>
<br>
And Crowley could feel the layers of his soul burn off. He felt them peel away, until all that was left was the core, a place where nothing could ever touch him. <br>
<br>
For the second time in his existence, and the first in his un-life, a switch went off in Crowley’s mind. The paradigm shifted. The world had suddenly changed. <br>
<br>
The gun dropped to the floor.<br>
<br>
Crowley blinked his eyes open, and after a moment, realized he had been crying tears of blood. He laughed, took a cloth and wiped them away. He picked the gun off the floor and mounted it on the mantelpiece. Perhaps he would get it framed, and keep it to remind him that even the most capable of Kindred are fallible. The game they played was one of precision, and if one wasn’t always careful, it could have fatal repercussions. <br>
<br>
Crowley looked out his window, looked out into the city, out into the night, out at the moon and the stars. Dawn was only a few hours away, and he would not be able to see it first hand, but that was all right… if he wanted to see the sun again, all he had to do was close his eyes. And never again turn away from the light.<br>
<br>
No. He said. It’s not over. In fact, it’s just beginning. <br>
He had beaten the void. He had been given another chance, and it was time to make the most of it. <br>
<br>
Crowley picked up the phone and went to work.<br>
<br>
<br>
OOC: Ahhh… Much better. Here’s to closure, and the hopes that tomorrow will be a better day. <br>
p.s. Scott, I’d like a card for the Luger.  (Dave and I worked it out already.)<br>
