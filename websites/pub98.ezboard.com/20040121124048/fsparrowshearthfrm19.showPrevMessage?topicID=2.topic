<br>
By ADAM GOLDMAN, Associated Press Writer <br>
<br>
LAS VEGAS - Famed performer Roy Horn of the Siegfried &amp; Roy duo remained in critical condition Monday after being mauled by a tiger, and the show has been canceled indefinitely, officials said.  <br>
 <br>
   <br>
<br>
About 200 fans and show employees stood outside the hospital at University Medical Center Sunday night, where Horn, 59, is being treated. He suffered a severe wound to his neck when the 7-year-old male tiger named Montecore attacked Friday night in front of hundreds of people. Officials said Sunday he had improved and could move his hands and feet. <br>
<br>
<br>
With the show's future uncertain, about 267 employees are out of a job. <br>
<br>
<br>
MGM Mirage officials said the show was &quot;closed indefinitely.&quot; They added that even if Horn recovers, it's unclear whether he would ever be able to perform again in the rigorous show. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are not going to sugarcoat this,&quot; MGM Mirage spokesman Alan Feldman said. <br>
<br>
<br>
Show employees were wondering if the company would pay out the rest of their contracts. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are worried about him, but we also basically lost our jobs,&quot; said 42-year-old Mary Bryan, a single mother who worked with the acrobats. &quot;We gave this show our heart and soul. It's awful we have to think about money at a time like this.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
MGM Mirage officials have promised to help employees land new jobs. <br>
<br>
<br>
Without the show, the fate of the tigers is also unknown. Montecore continues to be quarantined at the hotel, officials said. <br>
<br>
<br>
Horn had never been injured during a show before, &quot;not a scratch, not by an animal,&quot; said Bernie Yuman, the pair's longtime manager, who added none of the 63 exotic cats &quot;have ever shown aggression on stage.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Horn, along with longtime partner Siegfried Fischbacher, have been a staple on the Las Vegas Strip for years, performing their magic show to sold-out crowds at The Mirage since 1990. <br>
<br>
<br>
The illusionists, who put on one of the most well-known and expensive Las Vegas shows with their signature white tigers and lions, signed a lifetime contract with the resort in 2001. <br>
<br>
<br>
The German-born pair perform six shows a week, 44 weeks per year and have been onstage in Las Vegas for more than 35 years. They have done about 5,700 shows since coming The Mirage in 1990. <br>

I posted this article here also because it made me think about shows such as this.  Should we really be so surprised that a wild animal would attack a human being?<br>
<br>
Should animals be used for 'show' purposes?<br>
<br>
I remember talking to my dad once about the circus and the lions/tigers in the Barnum &amp; Bailey world famous show, as well as the ones in zoos.   I was arguing that they shouldn't be exploited like this.  He asked if I remembered where I first saw a tiger....I did.  It was in a zoo.  His point was that many kids may never see a wild animal EXCEPT in venues such as this and perhaps those experiences lead them to further understand or study these magnificient creatures. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vonalbro>VONALBRO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:navy;><b>Moderator and,<br>Lady of Good Cheer</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 401<br> <font color=#B87333>(10/6/03 1:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://groups.msn.com/_Secure/0QwCzBIwUv8W7zF37hMk5d2Fg1gGjCH4NVDV2aEEDmfZWPYYtpxbyWDu3oCGGn!h7Z8GOHVqiRpONsHzThX!4vt*eMHzBV8UCdLqqY!T1HFA/kittyav.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Roy Horn mauled by tiger</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Heartjoys asked: Should animals be used for 'show' purposes?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm not sure about it, to be honest.  I've watched a few entertainers in my time that had large cats for shows without an incident.  They have to realize the possibility that this may happen, and that includes an individual that goes to watch the show.  Am I surprised it happened?  No, although I wonder why it did.  One suggestion to me privately, was that the tiger was just playing, although I know the nose on the tiger is sensitive. It could be instead of admonishing the tiger, he really ticked the tiger off.<br>
<br>
In zoos it's another story, yes in a sense they are in captivity, the surroundings should be suited for the animal's environment with enough room for them.  For study, for viewing without interaction from a crowd.  From my understanding many of the animals at the zoo are ones that would not survive in the wild.  So if it is a safe place, with precautions taken as well as the best interests of the animal and human taken into consideration I don't see a problem with it.  <br>
YES, I would love to own a tiger or a lion myself, I think they are beautiful beyond description, but I know better.  I'll stick with the cats and dogs that are domesticated. <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.msterious.com/redxcat.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I do understand that some animals are on the edge of extinction, so they are being bred in captivity for those reasons. I'm not an animal activist, but I still have a great compassion for them.<br>
<br>
I saw a certain type of sea otter being raised in captivity. The handlers wore suits to disquise themselve as humans including rubber gloves, a diving suit, and welding helmets. So that when these creatures were mature enough to go back into the wild, they were not trusting of humans.<br>
<br>
I also understand about wounded animals needing a place similar to their environment where they can survive in peace.<br>
