Another beer soaked chump had soiled my favorite shirt.  Working this town was going to be rough.  I climbed the thirteen steps to my apartment and opened the door.  At first I thought it was beginning to rain, but I squashed that notion when I realized that Trixie was in the shower.  I tuned out the sound and tossed my hat on the tattered old leather couch.  That’s when I saw the bomb.  Sitting on the table in plain view, a red light flashing on its face.  I admit to panic now in hindsight, but my first reaction was anger.  I’d been in this city less than a week and some joker decides to cash in my chips.  I rushed over to see if I could defuse it.<br>
<br>
            Trixie was still in the shower and must not have heard me over the water and her own high pitched voice singing some new fangled song about chasing a man.  Typical dame.  Never pays attention to what’s going on around her.<br>
<br>
            I turned all my attention to the bomb.  Now, being undead has its advantages.  I didn’t smell any explosives that I’m used to, and the casing was of an unfamiliar design.  I had my work cut out for me.  Other than the flashing light, there was no way to tell how long I had.  I followed the only cable to my phone.  So it was set to go off when the phone was picked up, or so I thought.  At least I didn’t have a timeframe to worry about.  I sat down with the bomb in my lap and my back to the bathroom door.  I hoped that if it blew, my body would shield Trixie from the brunt of it.  I pulled out my leatherman, pried the screwdriver out of it and went to work.<br>
<br>
            By the time the light on the bomb went out and I did not explode in a flaming mass of Jack, I was literally sweating blood.  I wiped the back of my hand on my forehead and swore up a storm.  My heart was… well, my heart was still, but if I’d been alive it would have been pounding.  I set the dismantled bomb aside and stood up…<br>
<br>
            That’s when I saw him.  The drapes swayed and gave him away.  His body was sheathed in robes and he stood stock still.  Maybe he figured I wouldn’t notice.  But I did.  Then his smell hit me.  Pyramid Patchouli.  I reacted by rushing him.  I don’t think he expected it, but when I hit him, he moved.  Fast.  My punch connected and sent him sprawling on the floor, but he did not seem fazed by it.  It also smashed the lamp, plunging us into a darkness only mitigated by the street light from outside.  I grabbed him and noticed there was no pulse.  Great, I thought, a vamp.<br>
<br>
            We tussled for a few moments until he got the upper hand and we both went crashing out through the front window.  It only took a moment for me to recover, but it was enough for him to escape.  All that was left was his robe and a wire hanger.  He was probably getting it ready as a garrote.  I probably saved Trixie from a nasty death.<br>
<br>
            As I stood up and wiped the shattered glass from my coat, I heard Trixie yelling.<br>
<br>
            “Jack!!?  What the hell’s goin on out here!!?” I could hear her move through the room.  “What the hell’d ya do to the answering machine?”  There was a pause as I saw her move over to the window, “An where’s my robe?”<br>
<br>
            I could tell that I had some explaining to do.  Dames.  Never understand how much we protect them.  So now I had some robe wearing vampire ninja on my tail.  Great.  But, I had a scent.  Pyramid Patchouli.  There was only one joker in Santa Carla sensitive enough to wear that scent and I had to find out who he was.<br>
