He had a stillborn baby, had another child with a neurological defect who died at 25 and his other son's wife committed suicide a little over a year ago.  Since I just lost my sister, we were talking about how we are coping with this stuff, and just acknowledging that as much as it all hurts, life still needs to go on.  Well, that got me thinking(dangerous, I know).  Years ago people used to deal with tragic deaths all the time.  You'd have families where the parents would have about 10 kids, and then one or two of them would survive until adulthood.  Disease was more rampant, and it seems like there was a war every 5 minutes somewhere.  Major tragedies were something that most people experienced back in the olden days, and I was wondering to myself how people coped with that.  The first answer that popped into my head was religion.  When you have like 6 of your children and 5 of your siblings die on you in one lifetime, you need to find a way to cope, and I wonder if all this is tied into just how religious the general public used to be, and why religion was allow to rule so much in the world.  I mean, what better way to cope with all this than to tell yourself that you'll see that person again soon, or that there was some sort of good reason for God to come in and wipe out half your family?  We have only really begun to live a life of luxury recently.  Hearing about a child's death is a tragic isolated event, not something that goes on constantly in your very neighborhood.  We fill our time in a luxurious fashion compared to people years ago.  I think this also gives us more time to pontificate.  100 years ago I probably wouldn't have had a whole lot of time on my hands to wonder whether or not a deity exists.  Can our relatively new way of life lead us to less religion?  We have less tragedy in our lives and more time to think about metaphysical subjects.  Maybe the need for religious beliefs are being outdated with less tragedies to justify and more scientific explanations.  Anybody got any thoughts on this?<br>

I think it depends on what you believe when tragedy strikes. <br>
<br>
My mom died of cancer 4 years ago. She was 42 years old and left 6 kids behind, 3 under the age of 18. 2 weeks later my DH dad killed himself. For me I never once thought about changing my mind on how I feel about god. It just has never felt right for me. Sometimes I wished that I could believe in an afterlife because I think it makes you focus less on dealing with what is happening in your life. My husband felt the same way. He also lost his only brother when he was 17 (his brother was 19) in a motorcycle accident. At that time he was younger and decide to try church. It just didn’t fit. As for my JW siblings they have retreat further into their religion. They want to see my mom again at all costs. <br>
They no longer speak to one of my sister because she was DF a long time ago. I think it is really sad and it was not what my mom would have wanted. She made us all promise when she was dying that we would stick together, but I guess god has other plans.<br>

I think science plays a huge role in general. It is easy to blame stuff on god if you don’t understand.<br>
<br>
On a personal note. It really pissed me off after my mom died when people told me it will get better with time. It really does. You will get to a point that you will wake up and not have a pit in your stomach. You will also get to the point where you realize you don’t have to feel guilty about living your life even though your sister cant.<br>

I don't have to sit there and ask a deity why he did this, nor do I have to sugarcoat her &quot;current existence&quot; by pretending that she is in heaven while having doubts in the back of my mind.  <br>
<br>
I guess I was thinking about how people have used religion like a drug over the years.  It is just as easy to turn to religion to cope as it is to turn to a bottle of pills to cope.  I was sort of wondering if people thought that maybe religion has reached its peak since we have less &quot;use&quot; for it.  100 years ago a person could have gone completely batty with all the bullshit they had to deal with, so they let religion take over, and this in turn gave religion more power over the people.  There was just so much stuff going on, and we are pretty spoiled by today's standards.  <br>

Leah, I'm sorry to hear about what you went through.  If you don't mind me asking, what is DF?<br>

Its that teachability thing.  When everything is under control and we feel like we have life by the tail, we are more apt to be independent and less able to recognize our total dependence on Him.

Religion is comfortable. Religion also tends to take the responsibility off your shoulders. It stands to reason that the more trying times are, the more comforting religion is. <br>
<br>
Of course as Shirene said, alot of religious people consider trying times to be a test of their faith. How disgusting (sorry Shirene) imo. Why would you want to even worship a God who took your child from you simply to see if you would waiver. <br>
<br>
During my late teens I had some of the worse depression. And I clung to the Church. I wanted someone to be responsible for me because I didn't think I could do it. <br>
<br>
A few years later I let go on that last bit of need and ohh, it was so freeing. I guess in a way it was a test when we went through Edison's dignose and then surgery. I just didn't reach for a crutch this time. I found the strenght in myself and its far more liberating.<br>

I think that I walked away from this experience with tons of character. Not because of god but despite  god.

Also buy saying that it is all a test. It’s like blaming the person who survived. If they we good and humble this horrible thing would have never happened to their loved ones. That is like saying to somebody who just got raped that is their fault because they didn’t say no loud enough.<br>

<br>
I find it sad that your experiences with religion have been such that you have such a bad taste in your mouths for God and religion. <br>
<br>
God created this world, yes, and his plan included us having to experience the negative as well as the positive.  As far as control, God has the power to control everything but he also has the self control to not meddle with our right to make choices for ourselves(and that includes the natural consequences that accompany those choices.  He provided the world and allows man, nature and evil to run its course.<br>
<br>
The test isnt so that he will know, He already knows.  I guess I could have presented that more clear.  Its a refining process.    We are here to prove as much to ourselves as anybody, how we will respond to stress and trials.  We are building our spiritual confidence and muscles so to speak.  <br>
<br>
We (LDS) do believe that we are Gods children and that in order to become like Him someday, we have to learn by experience to control ourselves.  We have to be independently able to choose righteousness 100% of the time.  That only happens with practice.  In order to learn to choose good, we have to know what it is to choose bad and suffer the consequences.  <br>
<br>
Think of life as a University.  We are getting our degree in Godhood. College isnt easy.  Sometime you have to take very difficult and challenging classes.  On the especially hard ones you sometimes need a tutor who has been through it and understands the course material.  You can choose to ask for help from the tutor or struggle through on your own and maybe on your own you are NOT capable of &quot;getting it&quot; or learning the course matrerial.<br>
<br>
We are here to learn to be like God and could there be a better tutor than God himself.  That is why we turn to him in times when we dont know the answers. <br>
<br>
You find this distgusting to believe in a God who allows me to suffer, but just like the mom and dad who let there kids struggle to learn to walk -all that falling down, bumping into things - God is allowing me to learn skills and ablities here that I cant learn any other way and He is there for me to help me through the rough spots .<br>
<br>
I am sure it more agonizing for Him than we can ever imagine to watch some of us struggle and not ask for His help, I am sure that it is painful to see some of his children suffer because of the actions of others of his children, but He is there for us if we turn to Him.  He wont take over our agency and make our choices for us, but he will comfort us and teach us How to become more like him.  I find that beautiful.   -- Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mightyk>MightyK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/22/03 3:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=126.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: God and tests</span><hr size=1> What DL went through (sorry DL to use you as an example but your experience is the only one coming to mind at this moment) is NOTHING compaired to the bumps and bruises we let our children experience.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't stand by and watch my child at the expense of another child's life. But that's what you are saying God is doing when he gives us tests.<br>
<br>
Except for the fact that I had to make a massive decision (God-like) for my new born son on whether to have them cut open his skull, I don't see where going through the agony of major surgery on a 9 week old does anyone any good. Though NO decision of my own, my son was born with a birth defect. While it might not have affected his intellectual developement, it would have seriously deformed him, and given the severity of the birth defect might have affected his eyesight. So was this birth defect of my son because of some previous sin? That's sick. I know when I'm trying to teach my DD right from wrong I at least relate the consequences to the action. <br>
<br>
I can not relate to a God who would do something like that. It is not comforting. I makes me think of some sick pyscho who beats his wife and then tells her he wouldn't do it if she would just be good. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry Shirene, I'm trying to understand where you are coming from with this, but I just can not. If I heard of a girlfriend in a relationship like that, I would be urging her to leave the sick bastard. That the guy here is suppose to be a loving and compassionate God is just down right depressing. <br>
<br>
I am glad it gives you comfort to believe as you do. It did not, and does not, give me the same thing. And at the risk of sounding egotistical (again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) I'm better then that. I don't need a warped relationship to validate my existance. <br>

Why does there have to be an bad experience for me not to believe in god. I can always remember not believing. It has nothing to do with my experience with religion. That is such a copout to say that we must be damaged in some way not to believe. We just don’t plain and simple. My mother’s death and nothing to do with me believing or disbelieving in god.<br>
<br>
I find it sad that you feel like you can’t depend on yourself and get through life on your own without having to look to the sky for validation.<br>

<br>
I can either treat it too lightly, I can treat it too seriously, or I can receive instruction from it.<br>
<br>
Instead of focusing on &quot;Why would God take 3 children from me&quot;  I choose instead to believe that God has given me one incredible little boy who I value so much as a true gift from God, and I believe He has taught me that getting pregnant and having children are not something to be taken for granted.  Lesson learned.<br>
<br>
Instead of focusing on &quot;Why would God let my dad die so tragically and suddenly, and leave my mom alone yet again?&quot;  I choose instead to just trust that I don't have to know a reason, and instead rejoice that my mother has has grown closer to the Lord through the experience.  <br>
<br>
Some choose to use tragedy as an excuse to continue turning away from God, I choose to receive my comfort from Him and draw closer to Him.<br>

Other things like crime are the direct result of someone else choosing to do evil with their agency. It is in situations like that where God could be there to provide comfort and help lift the pain inflicted by another.  Just like any parent.  If we turn to Him.<br>

This is one of those black and white areas.  Either God exists or he doesnt.  We cant both be right and unfortunately in my feeling that I am right, I am saying I think your wrong.  But the same is true on the other side of the fence.  By saying that you think you are right,you are in effect saying that you think I am wrong.<br>

And since I think I am right I will go on feeling sorry that you are missing out, and you on the other hand will go on feeling sorry that I am so &quot;naive&quot;.  So by the nature of our postitions we offend.  Unintentionally though it may be we both see the other as misguided.<br>

<br>
I don't believe there is a god so I don't need an &quot;excuse&quot; to turn away from him. If I believed there was a god, turning away from him would be the last thing I would be looking for an excuse to do. If I could believe in all that eternal life/bliss/etc. why <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wouldn't</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I want it? You are free to believe in it, that's just swell for you. But don't assume that deep down I think it's all true but am just looking for some excuse to deny it. That makes no sense.<br>
<br>
I look at this world objectively and I don't see any reason to believe in god.  Belief in god seems like wishful thinking to me.<br>
<br>
I learned a lot about compassion, mercy and parental responsibility when I lost my baby. However, I don't think god crafted that experience in order for me to learn those things. And I don't think he took advantage of that experience in order to teach me those things.  They are just what I took from the experience, all by my little old self. <br>
