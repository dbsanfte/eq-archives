<br>
Calling all science fiction, fantasy, horror, media, and astronomical Artists and Fans! <br>
<br>
We would like to cordially invite you to be a part of the Dragon*Con 2003 Art Show. Dragon*Con is one of the largest annual Science Fiction and Fantasy theme conventions in the world with an average attendance of 20,000 people. This year the Art Show, Artist Bazaar, Print Shop, and Digital Art Show will once again be located in the Atlanta Marriott Marquis. This location puts the Art Show in the middle of the convention and we are on the same floor as the exhibitor's room and the celebrity autographs. With this location the Art Show should get all of the convention attendees to visit the Art Show. Our area is spacious, elegant, and well lit. The Dragon*Con 2003 Art Show is a very large and diverse event. It is a very active, exciting function and gives the artist a high potential for large sales. We believe art is all about capturing new ideas in one form or another and showing the world the awesome creativity within these works. <br>
<br>
We are planning many exciting events for the Dragon*Con 2003 Art Show including the 3rd annual Iron Artist contest, a large canvas that all the artists can work on (which will be sold at auction), an art salon, artists making art with live models, live music, demos, how-to's, and other wonderful events. We will be hosting our annual artists reception on Friday night of the convention. Panel discussions and demonstrations are very important to the Art Show as well. The programming room for all Art Show programs is right next to the main entrance of the Art Show. This location puts the Art Show programming room near the middle of the main convention level for all convention attendees to see while keeping an intimate environment inside. This will almost certainly guarantee high attendance to every program event.<br>
<br>
Last year, the The Dragon*Con 2002 Art Show was a huge success. The Art Show sold out over 2 months before the start of the convention. We had some amazing pieces from 185 artists from around the world. Artists from all over the world displayed artwork, elevating it to world-class status. The main Art Show was in a 16,500 sq. ft chandeliered ballroom. The Art Show programming did very well. In a room that seats 70 people; we had 28 different Art Show program items. From live demos to hands on participation people were captivated with what they saw. Many of the program events filled to capacity even before the events started. <br>
<br>
Another Art Show program event was the second annual Iron Artist. This was held in a large meeting room at the Hyatt, which seats close to 1,400 people. Iron Artist is based on the popular TV show Iron Chef. Kevin Murphy and Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater 3000 hosted the show. The Iron Artist this year was Don Maitz and the challenger was Joe Michael Linsner creator of the Dawn comic. The artists were given one hour, oil pastels, colored pencils, and 24&quot; x 36&quot; shadowbox to create something. In the end, Iron Artist Don Maitz won. <br>
<br>
During the 2002 show, we had 40 items go to auction and had over 400 attendees registered for bidder numbers. We will make full use of the Internet and other media to advertise the 2003 Art Show and Dragon*Con. This coupled with the excellent location should maximize the sales for all artwork in the 2003 show. <br>
<br>
Starting this year the Dragon*Con Art Show will be juried. The Art Show has become one of the most popular and prestigious Art Shows of these genres in the world. To continue to improve the quality of the show we are now jurying the show. There are some automatic jury acceptance criteria for those artists that have been in the Art Show in the past and those artists that have been awarded some of the art world's highest honors. We are also taking great care to include new and fresh talent just coming into the art scene as well. Please see the rules for all the details about the jury process. <br>
<br>
New student section! In keeping with the desire to help nurture new young talent we are adding a student section to the Art Show. Students are considered to be those individuals who are high school or college level that are art students or have an art focus. Student and amateur are different status levels of artist. Please see the rules for all the details about the new student section. <br>
<br>
We will be announcing many items about the Dragon*Con 2003 Art Show in the next few months. Please continue to check the Dragon*Con web site at<br>

There are many different sections to the Dragon*Con Art Show. The following is a quick orientation: <br>
<br>
ART GALLERY: The Art Gallery has many types of space available to display your artwork. We use a standard 4-ft. x 4-ft. pegboard for hanging space. We have many combinations of Art Gallery space listed on the Art Show registration form. We have 6' tables available as well as floor space. There is a 10% commission charged on all artwork sold in the Art Gallery. <br>
<br>
PRINT SHOP: The Art Show has a large area to display prints called the Print Shop. There is a Print Shop fee of $5 for attending artists or agented art. Print shop is limited to 26 SKU's (titles) with an unlimited quantity per title, however, be aware that even though we can display a large number of prints, there is a limited amount of space. A 15% commission is charged on each piece sold in the Print Shop. The Print Shop is restricted to the Professionals and Amateurs. <br>
<br>
ARTISTS' BAZAAR TABLES: These tables are discounted sales tables for the artists, located in the art room. All items for sale on these tables are either made by the artist or from the artist's designs. The Artists Bazaar is a special area for the professional artists to present merchandise related to their art and is located in the main art exhibition room. The pieces range from unusual and the exotic. <br>
<br>
DIGITAL ART Department: To present art in all it's native forms, we created the Digital Art department. This is an additional type of space within the Art Show. Artists are welcome to enter art in all the types of space we have. In this area, artists will be able to upload their entered artwork to our own FTP site or mail it to our Digital Art Manager on CD-ROM. The artwork can be animation as well as still artwork. At the show, computer stations will be located in the main Art Show ballroom. Some of these stations will carry work that can be purchased via print, and one station will just show &quot;display only&quot; work. We will have catalogs so attendees can browse through the work that can be purchased. If an attendee wants to purchase a print of one of the images in the show, they can have it printed &quot;on demand,&quot; by an on-site, professional printer and even have a selection of not only image size, but print type: watercolor paper base, or canvas in either loose or stretch frame-mounted form. (Stretched frame-mounted--Not to be confused with `framed' the canvas is stretched on a frame and stapled taught, as opposed to framed with glass and ready to hang.) If you are interested in submitting your digital art, please see the rules for further details. <br>
<br>
