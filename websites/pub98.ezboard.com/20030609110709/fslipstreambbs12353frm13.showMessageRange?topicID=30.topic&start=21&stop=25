Chapter 8<br>
<br>
The reincarnated engineer sprinted down the temporally empty corridors while his mind was raced as fast as his legs.  With each quick step he took, a new plan was born in his brilliant mind.  With the following step, that plan was quickly shot down.  Run away-no, my friends...Get Rommie back up and working-no, don't have the time...Get the AI back up-no, again, no time...Gas the whole ship-no, would hurt the others.  Plans came up, plans shot down, again and again till finally only one plan was left standing.  Kill them all and get his friends back.  The how in the plan was still to be figured out.  Now with each rushed step the how was slowly being answered.  Bombs, weapons, more bombs, more weapons, and one special bomb.  The exhausted engineer now knew where his weak shaking legs had to take him... Machine Shop 17.  Everything he needed was there, well almost everything.<br>
<br>
Harper rounded the last corner to his destination.  He saw the doors to the shop just a few yards away.  A memory flashed through his tired mind.  Earth, that fateful night, the Pytho's, that shot.  He could even hear the chilling voice, &quot;Well, well.  Look what we have here boys.&quot;  A cold wave of pure fear crawled up his spine.  Focus Seamus, he commanded his mind.  Mentally he pushed back the memories, the image of the unreachable sewer opening slowly morphed back into the door for the machine shop.  He was fully back in the present by the time he heard the hiss of the door opening.  <br>
<br>
Quickly, he punched codes into the control panel to secure the doors.  Not even Andromeda herself could access this room right now.  A sigh escaped his lips as he leaned his back up against the cold closed doors.  Safety...temporary safety, but he would take anything right now.  With each deep breath he took, the past 26 hours filtered through his system.  As the minutes pasted, his body's normal needs made themselves known.  He raced off to the bathroom.  A few minutes later he came out and grabbed a Sparky and 2 power bars from his secret stash.  A minute later all three items were well on their way to his stomach.  Then the last physical need was making it's self known.  Sleep.  His eyelids felt like a large group of Tyrs were pulling them shut.  He was now seriously regretting that the day before all this happened he had skipped sleep to start work on the sensors.  Regrettably, the immediate future held no time for a nap power, let alone a long rest.  <br>
<br>
Sparkies were strong, but not strong enough to keep him up till all the Pytho's were good and dead, he had his friends back, and Andromeda was back on-line.  One disturbing option kept popping up in Harper's mind.  He paced the cluttered room while contemplating his dilemma.  His one option would keep him up, but it also had some serious drawbacks.  Possibly deadly drawbacks.  His one options was to take a strong Earth drug called Buzz.<br>
<br>
His fatigued mind remembered the drug.  One dose of Buzz would keep a person going for four days without sleep or food.  It wasn't addictive and the user's thoughts were extra clear and extra paranoid.  The latter was a very good thing to be during a Magog or Drago-Kazov raid, which was when the drug was used the most.  A person could take Buzz and be able to run, hide and fight for 4 days non-stop.  No Magog would kill them when they passed out from exhaustion because they never passed out.  This was the reason why Harper had taken it twice before. Unfortunately Buzz had two major drawbacks which caused many people not to take it.  First, it was rare and thus expensive.  Harper had managed to acquire a small supply through selling his body to a human brothel for a month.  The thought of that month brought back more memories that he never wanted to revisit again.  The second reason most sane people never used Buzz was because of what happened when one came off of the powerful drug.  Convulsions, vomiting, massive delusions and paranoia, high fevers, possible heart attack or stroke, the list went on and on.  For 24 hours the user would experience these horrors.  After that time, sleep, sweet sleep.  When you did finally wake up, hours to days later, you would feel like you got hit by a large starship.  That was if you woke up at all.  Comas and death were not uncommon in Buzz users.  The longer you were on it, the more doses you took, the more likely those two outcomes were.  <br>
<br>
Harper reluctantly remembered the two time he used it.  Once, for a Drago raid when he was a teen in order to protect a younger very sick cousin.  Seamus made sure any Drago that came near their hideout during the three day raid died.  Unfortunately his cousin also died on the last night of the raid from the illness. The irony was not lost on young Seamus. The second time was a Magog raid a year later when he was living alone.  That time he ran and hid during the four day raid.  Both times, at the end of the fourth day, the young man went off to a remote ventilation shaft or sewer pipe.  He crawled into the cramped space and withstood the withdrawal alone.  His mind remembered the agony of those 24 hour periods and he really didn't want to go through it again.  He blinked and as his eyelids would not reopen willingly, he had his answer.  <br>
<br>
Hesitantly, he walked over to one of the panels on the far wall.  He pulled the metal panel off to reveal a small dirty leather bag.  His past, his life.  A shaky right hand reached in and took the bag from it's resting place.  Harper made his way over to his bed, placed the guns he had taken from Pytho's and Trance on the bed and sat down.  As soon as his body hit the soft mattress, a wave of exhaustion swept over his aching body.  Unwillingly, he opened the bag releasing his past.  <br>
<br>
Sticking out most prominently was his tin whistle he had just recently gotten back from Brendan....Brendan.  Being both physically and emotionally exhausted made Harper extra vulnerable to his normally concealed emotions.  Tears formed behind his eyes as he remembered his last family member and how he had abandoned him, left him for dead.  Harper pushed the whistle and the memories aside.  Looking back in the bag, he saw that gadgets mostly filled the pouch.  A communication device he had made for one of their little stupid play raids on the Dragos' compounds, one of the first shrillers he had made, and a few other random inventions.  He took the shriller out of the bag and placed it on the bed.  Next to the communication device laid his knife.  The knife he used to kill countless attacking Dragos and a few Magog.  You could attack Dragos, but Magog you ran from.  That knife was also used to kill Siobhan and Declan.  He was the unlucky one elected to kill his cousins because he was the only family member that was well enough to do it.  The others were either injured badly in the raid or were very ill and bed ridden.  He used that knife to slit their throats.  Memories of the blood dripping off the knife filled his mind.  Again, he pushed down the memories.  Grabbing the knife by the cold hard handle, he placed it on the bed next to the shriller.  Underneath the knife was a small silver locket.  A family heirloom.  It had been passed down from his Great-Great-Great Grandmother.  His mom gave it to him after the last of his siblings had died.  She wanted to make sure it got passed on and by giving it to her last surviving child she felt like it would protect him, keep him alive, so he could pass it on.  He pushed the small precious memory aside.  Finally, there, at the bottom of the bag was what he was searching for.  A small plastic bag that held three small green pills.  Buzz.  <br>
<br>
Harper managed to open the plastic bag with his one good hand and dumped the contents on the bed.  Hesitantly he picked up one of the powerful pills.  He examined the pill with reluctant eyes.  &quot;For the others,&quot; he whispered as he placed the pill under his tongue.  As it dissolved, a tingling sensation flowed through his tongue and then through his body.  A minute later, his eyelids were light, his mind was sharp, and his hands were twitchy.  It was working.  He placed the two remaining pills back in the bag and shoved it in one of his pant's pockets.<br>
<br>
The now re-energized Harper jumped up from his bed, put the bag back in the wall, put the panel back on the wall and skipped over to his work table.  Bombs, weapons and bombs.  The image of Pythos blowing up filled Harper's mind as a smile filled his face.  Sitting down on his stool, a realization hit him.  How was he going to build anything with one working arm?  Gently, his right hand lifted his left hanging arm and placed it on the table.  He commanded his arm to move, which it didn't.  Then he tried for a smaller goal and ordered his fingers to move, which they did.  He didn't have full range of motion but he could work with it.  Quickly he got to building.  His good hand flew over bits of machinery, wires and circuit boards while his bad hand mostly held objects in place.  Two hours later the cluttered table was clear, but surrounding Harper were bombs of every shape and size, as well as a few other random gadgets.<br>
<br>
The genius pushed himself off of his stool and walked over to one of the more cluttered corners.  He pushed a few layers of junk and clothes aside to reveal a courier bag, the type you place across a shoulder and chest.  He dumped out the contents of the yellow and black bag.  The last time he used it was on an away mission a few months back.  He never had the time to unpack.  What could he say, he was a busy and lazy guy.  <br>
<br>
Taking the bag, he headed over to the worktable.  Carefully, he placed each bomb and gadget in the it.  One special bomb he placed in a side pocket.  That one was not finished yet and had a very special purpose.  He then went over to his bed and picked up the shriller and the knife.  He placed the knife in his boot and placed the chain attached to the shriller around his neck.  He winched when the cold metal chain brushed up against his damaged data port.  Damn it hurt.  He grabbed the guns, stuffing one in his pants, and the other two in his bag.  Harper swung the bag across his right shoulder and chest making sure he had quick access with is good arm.  With his bomb-laden bag, he marched towards the door.  Seamus Harper was now armed, Buzzed and ready to kill.  <br>

<br>
Chapter 9<br>
<br>
The world flew past Harper as he raced down the corridors towards the engine room.  Luckily the Pythos felt unthreatened and were taking their sweet time filing into the ship. The corridors were still mostly empty except for the few times Harper had heard voices echoing through the corridors.  At each noise he stopped dead in his tracks and quickly changed his route to avoid anyone.  Times like this made him extremely happy that he knew the ship like the back of his hand.  Finally, gasping for breath, he reached the main doors to the engine room.<br>
<br>
The doors slid open to revile a blood covered grated floor.  His blood.  Quick flashes of Tyr breaking his nose, Dylan cracking a rib, and Trance laughing in his ear consumed Harper's full attention for a second.  A rising sense of fear brought him back to the present.  The tiny soft hairs on the back of his neck were saluting the waves of paranoia that raged through him.  His nervous eyes scanned the empty engine room as his fearful head keep whipping around searching for the unseen enemy - his friends, the Pytho's, the imaginary and real monsters from his childhood nightmares.  Soon, reason pushed the paranoia down and his heart slowed to a normal rate.  &quot;Calm down, there's no one here,&quot; he whispered to himself reassuringly.  He gave a last calming glance around the dimly lit room.  His eye stopped on the red floor again.  More quick flashes.  NO! he demanded from his mind.  Again, he pushed the living nightmares back, back into the small rusty box in his mind.  The box that was getting rather full and restless after today.  His mental self was jumping up and down on the lid to get it to close.  <br>
<br>
With his composure regained, his eyes left the haunting pool of memories and locked onto the engines.  He quickly strode over to it and started working.  Within a few minutes he had sabotaged both the impulse and slipstream engines by taking one small necessary component from each.  He received a nasty little shock and burn to his good hand when he shut down the impulse engines which were running at the time.  He sucked his burned figures briefly before he place the small delicate devices in his bag.  The Pythos would get nowhere without those two components.  Even Harper couldn't build them from scratch and they were some of the more expensive bits to replace.  Harper knew his engines.  <br>
<br>
The second reason he came to the engine room now grabbed his attention.  Andromeda's AI.  He practically skipped over to one of the computer consoles in the room.  While he hated coming off Buzz, he loved being on it.  It was like having Sparky flowing through his veins.  His right hand danced over the console punching up command after command.  Finally the hand stopped dancing but still twitched nervously.  He had his answer on how bad the AI program was messed up.  Luckily it was reparable but it would take time, time he didn't have right now.  His head dropped as a deep breath left his lungs.  &quot;Damnit Rommie, I could really use you right now.&quot; <br>
<br>
The self-pity was rudely interrupted by the sound of the doors hissing open.  With all the fear and memories that engulfed him when he entered, he had forgotten to secure the doors.  &quot;Shit, great going genius&quot;, he hissed to himself before he spun around to see who his visitors were.<br>
<br>
It turned out he didn't like his visitors.  They were not the twenty hot babes he had wished for, instead they were twenty large, mean Pythos.  Mixed expressions crossed their faces.  A few were shocked, some had pure rage in their eyes and the rest had that evil grin and blood-lust eyes that Harper had come to know so well.<br>
<br>
The shiver of fear that was making it's way up his back meet the ragging anger that was racing down his neck.  The anger shoved the fear all the way down to Harper's boots.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hiya guys, are you all here for the tour?  Well sorry to say, you just missed it, but lucky for you our next one starts in half an hour,&quot; he spit out only as Harper could.  The words were to occupy the Pythos as he was slowing reaching into his bomb laden bag.  &quot;If you would just take a seat, there are some magazines to read, and some brochures to look through.&quot;  His hand was fingering each bomb, searching for just the right one.  He found it. &quot;And our tour guide will be back....shortly?&quot;  His speech was cut short by the sound of twenty guns powering up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up kludge,&quot; the largest, dumbest looking one said.  In actuality they all looked the same, big, huge forehead, clouded over eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;What!?  But your tour, well I guess I can give you your money back if you're not satisfied,&quot;  The bomb was now firmly griped in his hand which was still hidden in the bag.<br>
<br>
With each word Harper spewed out, you could see the anger rise in the group of Pythos.  The head thug stepped forward, his gun never wavering from it's target, Harper's forehead.  He activated his communication badge.  &quot;Galaver,  I think we found what stopped the engines.  Did you happen to lose a very talkative and annoying kludge by any chance?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; came a stoically shocked voice over the comms, if that combinations is at all possible.<br>
<br>
If you have ever notice when people talk over communication devices they tend to look up, as if the air is talking to them, well Harper had.  &quot;Just what I said Galaver, a kludge, blond, bloody, short, annoying as hel...&quot;  At the word &quot;short&quot;, Harper had activated the bomb in the bag.  By the word &quot;annoying&quot;, he had the bomb out of the bag, and by the word &quot;as&quot;, the bomb was rolling across the bloody floor.  By &quot;hell&quot;, the small ball shaped bomb had hit the speaker's boot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry you didn't get to see our tour,&quot; Harper said as he quickly dived behind one of the larger pieces of equipment.  A nano-second later all he heard was &quot;Shi---KA BOOM!!&quot;,  followed by various gushy organs, flesh, bones and liquid hitting the walls and each other.  Soon it was raining.  Blood showered onto Harper's smiling face, a spleen bounced off his shoulder, a small bit of gray matter landed in his hair, pushing down some of his spikes.  He picked out the slimy tissue and fixed his spikes.  He found out that getting hit in the head by part of a femur kinda hurt.  Once the storm of body parts ended, he peaked out from behind his hiding place.<br>
<br>
The walls, ceiling and floors were coated in Pytho.  &quot;Hmm, nice wall paper, I think I like it, but the new floor covering has to go,&quot; Harper said to himself while taking in the carnage.  His bomb had worked perfectly.  It was a Harper special called a Soft Bomb which was made to only obliterate flesh and bones.  No damage to machinery or other metal objects would occur.   Perfect for an engine room battle.<br>
<br>
Harper strolled over to the open doors.  His feet sunk into the intestines of one of the Pythos as a small piece of a kidney fell from the organ coated ceiling onto his shoulder.  Harper picked it off and flipped the bloody piece of organ over in his hand, examining it.<br>
<br>
A small smile crept into is still bruised face.  &quot;Oh yeah, this is gonna be fun,&quot; he said with glee as he tossed the meaty soft kidney bit over his shoulder.<br>
