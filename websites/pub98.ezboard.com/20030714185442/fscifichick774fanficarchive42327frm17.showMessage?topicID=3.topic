OMG---Lex killed his father! Course this was to assend to the throne and in this reality---he wouldn't be put in the dungeon for it. Well, looks like you finally figured out a way for him to get rid of his dad and not go to jail for it. Although---justifiable homicide or protecting onself comes to mind in the real world. Wow, sweetie---you keep getting better and better. And even though I feel sorry for Whitney, I still say that Chloe belongs to the Lex of this world and I think her body agrees with her. All she needs to do is get her head around the idea. After all, with her by his side, he'll become a good king, rather than an evil one. Can't wait to see what you come up with next, hon. Prolific Peggy, who wants to write like Kris, when she grows up. : ) <br>

So, Lex has killed his father? Well, that makes sense since I'm <br>
assuming Lionel was as horrible in this world as he was in his own, but if I'm right then Lex can't kill Whitney because from what Pete said I'm guessing that Whitney has the powers in this world instead of Clark. This gets more interesting every new chapter! Looking forward to the next part<br>

But I also want to see how things go with Jack - and if he's as big a bastard as Lex says.  And of COURSE, I want to hear from Lionel on this whole romantic interest thing. <br>

the date.  I know some of you were hoping for a nice dream sequence, <br>
but I know for a fact that I would go passed the strong R rating if I <br>

Well, I'd say poor Damian, but the kid's an idiot.  War movies?  Horror?  Ok, maybe he wasn't so dumb - he probably wanted Chloe to jump on him everytime someone got their head cut off. <br>
<br>
In regards to the couple I really care about - great banter.  I really enjoyed reading this chapter - it made me laugh.  I absolutely can't wait to see what happens next!  Chloe better get her head screwed on straight and realize that Lex is the one. <br>

Hospital?  Now, why are they going to a hospital?  I love it, and it's about time Lana did something. As for Gabe...well, i loved how he was trying to protect his daughter, i just don't want to know how he's dealing with the news that Chloe actually Loves Lex and isn't against the idea of marrying him as much as he thought.  Actually, i do, so i hope that's a little part of the next chapter. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But finally, the man gets it---she loves him. : ) And poor slightly insecure Lex---she ain't leaving you, Lex. She needs you like the air she breathes---how do they breathe when they kiss that long, btw? &lt;g&gt; Only in fanfic, I tell you. &lt;bg&gt; Thanks for another wonderful chapter in the &quot;gotta get them to the church on time&quot; story, sweetie. : ) Prolific Peggy, whose damn proud of her collaborator.

Great chapter, Kris - <br>
<br>
Yeah, I was a little thrown off by the hospital thing, too, but I get it now.  She's gotta be pregnant!  You can't disappoint us now!  What else could that queasiness be?? <br>
<br>
I'm impressed with Gabe's effort - he obviously wants to keep Chloe safe.  Too bad he doesn't realize Chloe is safest with Lex. <br>
<br>
So, when's the wedding going to go down?  I guess not for a few chapters.  I'm just so excited!  This happens with all of your fics.  I read a chapter, get all gung-ho about it, and then read part of another fic.  At least with so many in the making, I don't have to wait too long for your writing.

Awwww---shucks. : ) That's great praise coming from somebody who can set my muse into a tissy and create some warm fuzzies when I read one of your pieces. &lt;g&gt; My friend Jay told me to keep myself warm because of the horrible weather outside and I told him, I am, by reading one of your pieces on Malu's site. Darn trouble---I can't remember the name of it now---it's the one where they sexual innuendo each other and they have a very interesting interview---that could only be shown on Showtime or HBO----and late at night. &lt;g&gt; Ring a bell? &lt;bg&gt; I loved it, btw---really warmed up this room, I tell you. : ) <br>
<br>
~~&gt; Ah, yes.  Yearning I believe is the fic that you're referring to.  Yet another challenge piece.  And what's sad is, I met the criteria for Sami's challenge in the first chapter, but then everybody complained because they, ahem, wanted more.  So - there you go.  Glad you enjoyed it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   &gt; <br>
<br>
That's the one! : ) You know, that's the mark of a good writer---leaving them wanting more. And you always could do a sequel----something like---well you used yearning so wanting is out---maybe Dreaming or Having--now that's the next step to yearning---having. Or something appropriate.  : )  Yeppers, I loved it. : ) <br>
<br>
Oh, just read your latest chapter to WTMW. Oh boy, that was so good. Chloe's a little clueless but then she is in Smallville too. Heehee---I've found somebody Chloe. Hint girl----he's looking at you and you must see it in his eyes---sweetie---it's you! I wonder what her reaction is going to be, though. Should be interesting. Nice to know this Lex might be jealous but isn't that bad. Now, if we could just take down evil clark a notch or too. :: sigh ::  Talk to you later, sweetie. Your friend, Peggy. <br>

And trust me, he's just as blind with it or without it. In fact, it would work better if he had it back in the series. &lt;g&gt; Course, there was that little flirting thing but I'm betting if he got close to Chloe---he'd be singing soprano for a month and never go after her again. &lt;bg&gt; Sweetie, this was great---from the talk with the lawyers right down to the kiss. :: sigh :: This is just what I needed to start off the New Year right.

   <br>
Wow, Kris... I'm loving so much this fic... I already was, but in this two last chapters, something more than the wonderful writing came...<br>
I'm kinda living a pain situation myself. My boyfriend really hurted me in New Eve's Party and I don't know exactly why but I didn't want to see anybody today. He, because I'm really pissed off and really hurt. I don't know what I'm going to do about it yet but I didn't want to see his face or listen to his voice. But what explains the fact that I didn't want to see any of my friends?? And that I didn't get up until 6 PM and that I exilated myself in this room since I'm wake, so I don't have to see my parents?? Don't have to explain my red swolen (i don't know how to spell) eyes???<br>
I really don't know. But I feel that I could talk to your Lionel, you know?? Maybe he would entertain me enough to make the pain go away for a while because he's an interesting person or maybe he would make me see that I shouldn't be so sad about someone who can't respect me all the time or maybe tell me that I shouldn't be so sad any forgive my boyfriend because it was not a big deal. But would me easier to open myself with him than with my friends.<br>
So, your fic is kinda lightning me about my sadness and the weird desire to not see anyone or talk about this.<br>
 <br>
Sorry about this, I don't want to bother you or anyone here with my problems, but it felt right telling you about it.<br>

Subject: Re: Oh god!<br>
<br>
<br>
 Before I answer---oh god, again. The next chapter to Welcome to my world---is so wonderfully hot---that's the word---hot. Oh steaming is a good word too. You want to hear something freaky---sometimes to get away from thinking about a story I'm working on, I let my mind wonder. If I think about the story, I have to get up and go to the computer and write it down before I forget it---not a good idea at 4 in the morning. &lt;g&gt; So, I was thinking about this story where Lex and Clark are brother's the princes. Their parents are of course Martha and Jonathan---the kind rules. Lex has abdicated the throne so Clark is next in line. : ) And the person he's supposed to wed---Lana of course. And then there's her sister---Chloe. Now, can't have them as twins so Chloe is older by one year. <br>
<br>
The day before the wedding---Lana is kidnapped by the evil king---you guessed it---Lionel. Ewwwwww! He wants to do it so he can kill both of the princes and overtake the neighboring kingdom. :: grrrrrr :: So, they're off (the princes) to get her back, with Chloe taging along, despite Lex's best efforts to keep her away. Which might have been a good idea, since she get's kidnapped too. But they save the day, the king is killed (the bad one) when he tries to kill Lex, by Clark, and since there is no heir to the throne---the kingdoms are combined and Lex is given the evil ones kingdom (pretty big kingdom for one prince--who will eventually become king) to handle. &lt;g&gt; And who's Lex's queen----well, we know the answer to that. &lt;g&gt; <br>
<br>
Oooooo, maybe I should keep this idea handy and we can do this as another collaboration. Actually, the dream had Chloe as herself--not in the medivel sort of thinking----see a book on King Arthur fell on her and she was out cold dreaming this. : ) And at the end she wakes up to a very concerned Lex and she kisses him. &lt;bg&gt; To his astonishment. &lt;vbg&gt; So, what do you think?  <br>
<br>
Wow----Chloe is really showing her claws----meoooowwwww.  Yeah, but sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind. And with the way she's acting, Lex will see it as looking into a mirror and wants to stop her from going to the dark side. <br>
<br>
~~&gt; Yup.  He doesn't want her to turn into what his father was trying to turn him into (and which, according to the comics, he will eventually turn into).  Of course, the original comics (and I only know this because my husband collects them) had Lex turning evil as a way to get even with Superman for causing him to be bald - sooo, obviously the legend has changed quite a few times over the years.  &gt; <br>
<br>
Yeah, I wonder how they're going to do it in the series. It'll be interesting to see. I'm thinking the Warrior Angel/his friend now fiend, is the way they'll go. Lex will ask him to do something against Clark's morals and that'll end their friendship fast. It's just hard to think this will happen yet. You know, I was on a list where they kept saying, he's evil now. Now, he's not going to turn evil, he's going to turn bad. Right now, he's very human---especially with him attacking the meter man's car. <br>
<br>
You know, somebody told me Lex loved his daughter. You have to wonder if somebody who can be capable of that, can be all bad. Mind you Harley Quinn loves the Joker and she's pure bad. It depends on what Lex would do for his daughter, I guess. And if she loved him back too. But, as they said in a program I saw recently on comic villains, the best of them---you can feel sympathy for them. After all, they were made, not born. They had to have made a wrong turn along the way, and nobody deemed to set them straight. Right now, all that's keeping Lex on the straight and narrow, is Clark. : ) <br>
<br>
It's like the piece I did with Chloe meeting her mother. He's watching this scene, remembering how he forgave Clark for keeping his secret from them and yet not forgiving his father. He know's how it can eat you up inside, so he wants to stop it from happening to her, if he can. Which he does in mine and I'm betting, does in yours. Thanks for understanding why I won't be reading it. Just too hard, even with my favorite writers, which you are definitely one, sweetie, to read something that reminds me of what will happen in the series---lex going bad.  Sigh---too bad---he would have made a good ally for Clark---well, what they don't do in the series, we do in fanfic. &lt;g&gt; Talk to you later. Your friend, Peggy. <br>
<br>
~~&gt; Fanfic is a wonderful outlet that way.  You can twist the characters around so they can be how you want them to be w/o losing their personalities (okay, well some writers do that too, but that's not the point).  And yes, I totally understand about the reminder thing.  One writer wrote a future Chloe/Lex fic where they both went evil, but offered no explanation behind it.  It was kind of torturous.  Anyway, going to try and go write now.  Wish me luck, because every time I sit down to write on a story lately my muse leads me to a different one. <br>
<br>
Kris &gt;<br>
<br>
Yeah---fanfic is a godsend. : ) You know, the one thing that is definitely canon for me when I write is that verbal judo. Funny how only one scene can open the floodgates for those two. : ) You know, there was this one piece I read on Malu's site called The Wish. I was sitting there, reading this thing, freaking out because it seemed that Lex's wish this year was to have sex with Chloe, for him helping her get Pete's mother out of an investigation. I  wondered why I was reading it until he started to fake it and at the end, he told Chloe that he gave up his real wish for her---to ask his dad to leave his house. I cried at that and then Chloe gave him a kiss on the cheek---seeing something most don't---a selfless act from Lex Luthor. So, I'm glad I stuck it out. : ) Except for the ending---he had a girl come in to relieve him---so to speak. I skipped that part. : ) Good luck with your writing, sweetie. Talk to you later. Your friend, Peggy. <br>

See, I knew mushy wasn't a bad word. : ) I was told once in no uncertain terms it was and I keep telling people, it ain't. : ) Heehee---well, I can just picture Chloe running out into the cold and snow, if he had made his presence felt---course he would have run after her. : ) But didn't want them to catch a cold or something---not very romantic---a runny nose. &lt;g&gt; So glad you loved the piece, Kris. And I see you've added more to your alternate reality piece. I've read Lovestruck and I tell you, I love a Lionel that hedges his bets. &lt;g&gt; And Lex trying to find out what her dress is like---isn't that close to see the bride before the wedding. They are just so cute together when they get on the phone. : ) Can't wait to see what happens next. And I'll be sending the next part of our collaboration to you tonight, sweetie.

SQUEAL!!!  Ok, that was like the cutest thing ever.  But really, she shouldn't be all that surprised, not after a while ago when Lex said he wasn't picturing them in her room because that wasn't where they would be living.  *dances about*  And Clark's excuse for the door . . . *snickers*  <br>
At least Lex and Chloe are catching on to the fact that adrenaline is his excuse for EVERYTHING. ^_~  And now I'm anxious to see what they have to tell each other.  A couple of hours, eh?  *looks at time stamp on email.  Stupid time zones . . . I have no idea how long ago you sent -this- one <br>
. . . oh well.  Just post the next one SOON!  I'm dying here!<br>

OMG---it's getting hotter and hotter, sweetie. : ) Take off the shirt---I don't want anything to remind me of Clark. Caveman Luthor shows up---Well, like it way better than bad boy Luthor. : ) You done good, sweetie---especially all the mentions of marriage---like we knew Chlex wouldn't eventually show up at that doorstep. Truthfully, when I used to read MSR, I stayed as far away from marriage fic as I could because it never made much sense to me---Mulder never seemed to be marrying material for some odd reason. And them having a child together---seems odd in the series and in fanfic. But then, I guess I was more an SSR than an MSR. Now Chloe and Lex, I can so see married---Chloe and Clark---he's too immature for her. She's way older beyond her actual age---I bet she and Lex were born old. Or time and circumstances helped them along the way. They have a lot more in common than Clark and Lex have or Clark and Chloe. Talk to you later. Your friend, Peggy. <br>

Okay, in order, Bad Lionel, Good Lex, Good Chloe, Bad Clark. Clark is really pissing me off. Course, he can't tell a lie and yet he can keep a secret so big it would blow the lid off of anything Lionel's doing? The man is so contradictory at times. :: sigh :: Loved this sweetie. By the way---Gatecon in September? I take it MR's going to be there or something? Talk to you later. Your friend, Peggy.  PS: Did I forget to mention Gabe---well, he's half good/half bad. After all, he should call his daughter----he's worried about her. As he's about to ravage her---the damn phone rings. :: sigh :: <br>

But funny, with this story and a few others---I can see the potential for him being changed by Chloe too. Her magic might work on other Luthors.

Lovestruck 7-14: I really like where youre taking this fic with the addition of Lionels involvement and the Chloe/Lex wedding. I dont have an opinion on whether or not I want Chloe to turn out to be pregnant. I could see it happening both ways. Chloe seems strangely assured that shes not pregnant. I wonder why? If it was me, I would be freaking out. I cant wait for the next chapter.<br>

Welcome to my World 1-7: Im so happy that you wrote a sequel to The Gatehouse. I really liked that fic. This one is turning out just as well. Evil Clark really bothers me, *shiver* but I like the worlds that Clark and Lana and Pete and Allison are on. Please keep going. <br>

I can imagine with Pete will all that mistletoe. Leave it to Lex to take advantage of a good situation at just the right time. And leave it to Lana to take playing matchmaker to a whole new level. Wonderful story! Thank goodness you posted chapter 11 to Lovestruck. I was just dying to see how or what Chloe was going to say. But I'm glad that she made the right choice. Hopefully she'll make an even better choice and marry Lex. And putting Lionel as the matchmaker! I think I'll follow everyone else's suit and say he's just being so adorable.

Two great chapters. In Pete and Allisons reality the sorceress is Chloe, right? Sounds as if Lana might discover Clark's secret - that should be interesting. Who's gonna be the psycho Alex or Clark? Can't wait to find out so please update again v. soon.<br>

Okay, somebody find some sort of Kryptonite quickly, please. Clark is really giving me the creeps here. Hmmmm---if he's so bad in this universe and since red K made the good Clark, bad---might red K make him the opposite of bad? And I wonder if his parents know about this? Does he have parents at all? Good lord, write faster. I like Lex and think of him as a very strong character but maybe---their Clark might show up to help him take care of the other one.

There has got to be a way to take care of a bad Clark----for this Smallville's sake alone. You don't think that Chloe and Lex would like to leave this world at the mercy of this Clark do you? &lt;g&gt; Hmmmm---then, with him gone, that worlds Chloe could come back to Alex and happy endings all around. I tell you, I like Clark on the show but this one---not so much. The guy is scary---a real psycho. Prolific Peggy. <br>
