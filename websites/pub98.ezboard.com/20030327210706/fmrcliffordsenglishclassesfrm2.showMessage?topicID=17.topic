<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I think that the American society today is very selfish. People will do almost anything to get ahead in the world or make sure there life is better. In All my Sons Kate is a good example of this. She is very selfish and she will never change to anyone else’s needs. Whenever someone asks her to do something, if she does not like it she will just change the subject or say I do not want to talk about it and walk off. She acts like this always when someone might mention that Larry is gone. I think Sue is also selfish to ask Ann to move away. She may not like how her husband acts around Chris but that is not Chris’s fault. For her to ask them to move away is very selfish. Keller is selfish as well by not telling Chris the truth about his business. If he really loved Chris and wanted Chris’s respect he would have told him the truth. American society is selfish in my opinion and it is always about them.<br>

The people that live in our society are very selfish, corrupt, and immoral.  In All My Sons<br>
Joe Keller is a good example of a person who is corrupt and selfish.  Joe lied to the court saying that he had nothing to do with the shipping of the damaged cylinder heads, which is entirely untrue.  He is the one who told Herb to ship them out because he was afraid he would lose money.  He even admitted to lying about the whole incident.  He told Chris that he lied for his (Chris’s) sake and the future of the business.  He told Chris that if he told the truth to the court that he would have been put in jail and out of business because they needed the cylinder heads for the P-40’s.  Joe has kept this secret from Chris for many years because I think he feels bad for the decision he made.  I think that Joe is selfish because he seems to care more about the business rather than telling the truth and saving his friendship with Herb.  Another character who is very selfish is Sue.  I think it was very rude of her to ask Anne when she marries Chris if they could move away because Sue’s husband doesn’t like Chris.  I don’t think it is Ann’s problem that Dr. Bayliss doesn’t like Chris.  I don’t think that it is fair that Sue is asking Ann and Chris to move away when she and Jim could move away from the Chris.  Sue is selfish and doesn’t want to move because she does not want to lose what she has so she asks Ann if they could move away.  I think that there are many hundreds of people in this society who are like Joe and Sue very selfish and self-centered.  In my opinion the American society is very self, corrupt, and immoral.  <br>

As seen in the play, Americans have the tendency to be more selfish than other cultures, which may even lead to corrupt and immoral thoughts and actions to produce a desired outcome. This is seen in certain scenes of All My Sons. An example of this is Joe’s justification of his horrible actions, stating that his son never flew p-40’s, and as a result was not completely unjust. Of course this does not justify anything, but since it did not affect him directly he is able to dismiss the highly immoral and illegal actions with ease.  Another scene that comes to mind which demonstrates a selfish and even corrupt society is the act of both Kate and Joe hiding the truth from family and friends  to protect their own skins. The low morality level shown here is reflective of today’s American society, and the ruthlessness that is possessed by many.  In the future, we as a society will hopefully raise the bar for all things concerning morality, as well as selfish and corrupt actions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=teruin2pac>TeruiN2pac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 10:38:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Reply to Hayley325</span><hr size=1> well I agree that American society is greedier than most other countries <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , but if you put any group of people in a similar position, it would be quite similar, unless they were Buddhist or something.

I think that the play All My Sons parallels our society today in the ways of corruption. Just look how corrupted Joe Keller was. Look at corrupt businesses today. Joe put people's lives at a great risk by letting those cylinder heads be shipped out, and it was all for his own personal gain. What he did was very selfish and irresponsible. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Also, Kate, I believe, is corrupt as well. She was just as guilty as Joe was, because she also kept the secret from Chris. They both knew the horrible thing they had done, and let Chris stick up for them. I think parents today do that to their kids, they keep secrets from them, but then they turn around and punish them when they find something out. They're all hipocrites I tell you. Its all politics. The FBI, CIA, DEA and police are all spying on us 24/7. I think our world is more corrupt than that of the All My Sons play. People always do immoral things, most of them never care. Big businesses step over the little guys all the time. That is what Joe Keller was afraid of. He says that he had to send out those heads, so they wouldn't go to another business, and he could change them later. Well, it didn't work out like that now did it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START |I --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tired.gif ALT="|I"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=teruin2pac>TeruiN2pac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 10:54:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  addition </span><hr size=1> When Joe was pressured in the factory, it was his instincts that told him to just keep up with it. He thought he could maybe make a new batch to replace the cracked cylinder heads. I don't think it was so evil of him to do such a thing. Worse things could have happened. At least he felt bad about his mistake. When Chris wanted to marry Ann, I think that it would have been thoughtful of Chris to ask his mother for permission and be patient with her. It was his right to marry her, but he was killing his mothers dream of Larry returning. But again I don't believe it portrays American society more than any other affluent society. Money does cause corruption, which caused Joe to ignore his conscious. <br>

Americans just think about themselves and how to get ahead in life. They only think about being better then the next person and making money. Joe Keller shows selfishness by sending off the the cracked cylinder heads even though he knows that they are unsafe. He can only think about the money he will make and not the safety of those men flying the planes. He thinks that he is doing Chris a favor by leabing him money however Chris believes that it is wrong. It was also very wrong of Kate and Joe to keep this secret from Chris for so long. It just hurt him more in the end. Another character that is selfish is Sue. It was very rude and immoral of her to tell Ann that when she marries Chris that they should move away because he husband doesnt like Chris. In life not everyone will get along but you have to lean how to accept it and live your own life and not let it get to you. Not everyone is going to be like you so you. You just have to lean to live with it. Its selfish of Sue to tell them to move away. If they cant live with them and accept them then they should move away. She just expects that it'll all be taken care of. In my opinion American society is very corrupt and selfish. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=melendreza2>melendreza2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 9:30:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   All My Sons</span><hr size=1> In the play All My Sons it accuraltey displays how people can be corrupt, selfish and immoral. The play parallels society today. Joe did all three of these things at once when he went out the cylinder heads. he was selfish because he let the burden fall on Herb, he was corrupt because he let his son stick up for him when he wasn't innocent and he was immoral because he had innocent people die so that he could keep making money and not have his plant close. Kate is another example, she knew about Joe's horific act and didn't tell anybody. they both let an innocent man go to jail and lose his daughter and let their son look like a fool by sticking up for them. In our society today many people do immoral and selfish things. for instance how many small buisnesses have to close because of a chain store moving in near by? the only reason for the big buissnes moves in is because  they want to make more millions(like they aren't rich enough). Immoral things are like clear cutting the rainforest to graze cattle when the people know that the rainforests are needed and the land is horrible for grazing.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=meckeljp>meckeljp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 10:06:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Does AMS accurately characterize American society?</span><hr size=1>      I believe that the play All My sons is a relatively accurate portrayl of American society today, at least moralistically.  However I dont think that it necessarily means that Americans are immoral, and only look out for themselves.  Joe Keller was a man trying to fend for his family, he wasn't trying to kill people.  He figured the heads would never be used, and by the time they were discovered he would have the factory working again.  I think that if this play accurately depicts Americans today, then yes we have problems, but in the end mean well.  For every Joe there is a Chris, a person that is absolutely opposed to hurting other people, no matter what.  Besides, I believe that Joe didn't have harmful intentions, just as most Americans today.  Society as a whole has good intentions, just the wrong way of doing things.  Joe was only trying to provide for his family, he had good intentions.  He just didn't think about different ways to do it,  made a bad decision,  and now men are dead because of it. Good intentions, with poor execution.  Americans sometimes become so obsessed with what they think they need to do, that they dont stop and look at what they're doing.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deanp2>deanp2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/13/03 11:52:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   All My Sons</span><hr size=1> I think that this story relates and doesn't relate to society because  I think that they would have more security for the airplanes, they wouldn't just stick parts without checking them at least twice, especially when they are for the government and people are fighting in them. I think that it relates to how Kate acts toward her feelings that Larry is still alive, I think that a lot of people lose people that they love in wars and when they aren't sure what really happened to them then they think that they are still alive somewhere. It is just what you want to believe and that they are ok and they will return some day and everything will be fine. I also think that our society is immoral because when Chris and Ann want to be together and they let everyone know. Both sides of their family thinks that they shouldn't for different reasons than they wont be happy together. They are thinking about what Chris and Ann want, they are just thinking about what they want and they don't care that Chris and Ann will be happy together. They just want it there way and they really wont think of it as a good thing until that is what they want also. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andersonmp2>AndersonMp2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/14/03 7:42:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   AMS</span><hr size=1> Yes, to a certain extent do I believe All My Sons captues the spirit that many Americans possess. Unfortunately those traits are selfishness, corupt, and immoral. Joe Keller is a perfect example of this. He knowingly shipped out the defective cylider heads, all for &quot; the business&quot; and his son, Chris. And, after people suffered from his stupidity and selfishness, he let the blame fall on some one else. This certainly is an example of our cruel society, in which every men is for himself. although, the play also relfects another aspect of our society, and that is forgiveness. Ann forgives Chris's family for what they did to larry and her father. She doesn't hold it against Chris for what his father did to her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=geret2>GereT2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/14/03 10:49:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  ya</span><hr size=1> For your information, nick terui, or whatever your name is, your wrong. and smoking is bad! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=geret2>GereT2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/14/03 11:00:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Reply to VezilichK2 (Kristina V.)</span><hr size=1> &quot;Joe Keller shows selfishness by sending off the the cracked cylinder heads even though he knows that they are unsafe.&quot;<br>

I don't think this is true. Joe tries to keep his company for Chris' sake. All Joe wants to do in life now, is give everything to Chris, and work to make his life better. Joe didn't do it for himself. He was not being selfish. If he was being anything it would be called something like &quot;son-ish&quot;, because he was being &quot;self&quot;ish for Chris. Your way off when you say &quot;self&quot; because Joe didn't do it for him, but for chris rather. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=callp8>CallP8</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/14/03 11:14:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Travers you're a jerk</span><hr size=1> Appologize to my ntua ifhs<br>

However I think you're wrong about Joe and Mother being greedy.  Joe was only trying to keep the business going for Chris, that's why he lied.  He knew that Chris would never accept the business if he found out what really happened.  All Joe wanted was for Chris to be happy and rich, he wasn't being selfish.  Mother wasn't selfish, she was sick.  She only objected to people talking about Larry being dead because she couldn't accept it.  Mother was so sad about Larry that she pushed it away into a delusion that he was coming back, instead of really facing the sadness. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif">www.ezboard.com/images/em...s/pimp.gif</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=17.topic&start=21&stop=25>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=17.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/baseball/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=17.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.threadControl?topicID=17.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/baseball/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=17.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=17.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm1">Announcements<option value="mrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2">General Discussion<option value="mrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm3">Polls<option value="mrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm4">Administration Discussion<option value="mrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm5">Help Files<option value="mrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm6">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CC00>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses>Mr Clifford's English Classes</a><font color=#00CC00> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2>General Discussion</a> <font color=#00CC00> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM RECREATION AD SCRIPT -->
