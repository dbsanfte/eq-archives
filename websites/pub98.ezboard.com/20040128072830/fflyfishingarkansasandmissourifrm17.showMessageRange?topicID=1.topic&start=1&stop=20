<br>
This last year the White, Norfork, and Little Red had a tremendous flow from rains in Southern Missouri and Northern Arkansas. The resulting rise in water levels flooded areas of the lakes that had not seen water in several years. Those areas stayed flooded for months. As a result of that we had several tons of vegetable matter introduced into the upper watersheds. As this debris began to decompose it removed a majority of the oxygen from the lower levels of the lakes. since these lakes pull their water from the lower regions we have had several months of water with lower than desirable dissolved oxygen levels introduced into our tailwaters.<br>
<br>
In the 90's we had some real issues with the water quality on the Little Red. There was a massive fish kill when the Corps of Engineers (COE) and South West Power Administration (SWPA) released full generation of low oxygenated water. The kill resulted in minimum water quality standards on all of our rivers of I believe 2ppm.<br>
<br>
From what I have been told by the biologists in the state 2ppm is still a minimum only to sustain life in those areas. They feel that with the frequency of low oxygen events we have that we should begin to look at an option of adding oxygen to the water as it is released from the dam at anytime the the leves fall below 6ppm. <br>
<br>
With all that being said I have a few questions:<br>
<br>
1. Do you feel that low oxygen is a concern at 2ppm or is that sufficient to maintain a fishery? Most of the time when I see low oxygen levels the fish leave the area. When they are in heavy generation could 2ppm still be an issue? <br>
<br>
2. It has been suggested that 6ppm would be much more desirable. Is that a number that is sufficient to maintain a healthy fishery? What would it take to implement a plan to remedy this situation?<br>
<br>
3. What can we as citizens of Arkansas do to remedy the situation.<br>
<br>
I have been told by several people whose opinion I respect that this could be the issue of greatest concern to the fishery. What are your thoughts?<br>

You ask some insightful questions.  First, most fishery biologists think about dissolved oxygen levels in milligrams per liter, roughly equivalent to parts per million.  Thus, 2 ppm is about 2 mg/l.  The dissolved oxygen (D.O.) levels required by most trout species to maintain general good health is around 8 mg/l.  That being said, it should not be surprising that trout leave the area when the D.O. levels are 2 mg/l.  Certainly, 6 mg/l would be better, but, to the trout, it is analagous to the difference between being outright suffocated, and being somewhat asphyxiated.  They probably want to leave either way.  So, in answer to your question, yes, 6 mg/l is better, but it is generally cited as a minimul level required for trout suvival. <br>
<br>
Also important is the time of day that D.O. levels are measured.  For example, is 6 mg/l the average over 24 hours, or measured at a specific point during the day?  The relevance of this is that during the night, when photosynthesis is at it's lowest, D.O. levels will also be at their lowest, and during the mid to late afternoon, D.O. levels will be at their highest (coinciding with the highest levels of photosynthesis).  If the D.O. levels being cited are moving averages or mid-afternoon levels, then you are probably having periods with substantially lower D.O. levels during the night (referred to as D.O. sags).  <br>
<br>
There are many habitat features (both physical and chemical) that have the potential to limit trout populations, but if the D.O. levels that you cite (2-6 mg/l) occur with some regularity,then you could be correct in your assertion that this might be the issue of greatest concern to Arkansas trout fisheries. <br>
<br>
So, I recommend that you, the citizens of Arkansas, begin to ask some pointed questions.  Such as, when and how are D.O. levels being measured?  Is 6 mg/l of D.O. really desirable for trout, or it is a minimum level to avoid fish kills?  (a D.O. level below about 4 mg/l is generally considered lethal to most trout species)  You should also begin inquiries into when the White River system dams are scheduled to undergo Federal Energy Regulatory Regulatory Commission (FERC) relicensing.  It is during the relicensing process that you can exert the greatest amount of influence over future operating practices.  <br>
<br>
If you have further questions, please let me know.  - Rick<br>

<br>
One of my main concerns is that we are trying to maintain a spawn on the White River system. So much so that they have closed that area for 3 months out of the year to protect it. From my own personal observations the fish stayed out of that area this year. I can only assume that it was due to the long term low levels of dissolved oxygen. <br>
<br>
On the surface it would appear that dissolved oxygen leves are infinitely more damaging to our fishery than the anglers could be. It is hard to step in redds that will never be made if the fish aren't there. It looks as though we just had a spawn that was about 20% of what it was last year.<br>
<br>
What can be done to remedy dissolved oxygen levels as the water leaves the dam? That first mile of river is the most precious in our river system.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Our low oxygen levels this winter are related to the high water we had over the summer. As the lake filled it flooded areas that introduced vegetable matter into the water shed. This material settles to the bottom of the lake and decomposes. The decomposition process takes a considerable amount of oxygen. When I fished the C&amp;R area in October it was all but devoid of life.<br>
<br>
After losing many of our fish to high water temps in the summer over the last few years, it would appear that we have now lost a sizeable portion of our spawn to low oxygen levels.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This is apparently when they began to run at such high flow fluctuations that the DO problems began to crop up.  It is my understanding that Senator Hutchinson sponsored a minimum flow bill that will allocate 5 feet at Bull Shoals, 3 feet at Table Rock, 1.5 feet at Beaver and Greers Ferry.  A two-year study was conducted by USCOE to determine the effects of the proposal, and has just completed it and delivered the results to AGFC.  The rumor is the report is 100% in favor of tourism, recreation, and fish, and that the findings will be presented to D.C. early this year.  A 45 day public comment period would then occur, after which Congress would be asked to act on it.  I just found out about this, is it old news?  Are these reasonable increases in minimum flows?  <br>
<br>
It is also my understanding that Bull Shoals only has a hypolimnetic intake for the turbines.  If so, this would explain why there would be low DO levels during the conditions that John describes.  The water is cold enough to have plenty of O2, but respiration during benthic decomposition in the lake used it up.  The fix to this is that they install intakes at multiple levels.  Then they can provide a blend of waters from different levels that best meets the needs of the fish downstream.  Expensive, but the best long-term fix.  <br>

Happy to have someone with your knowledge explaining this.  <br>
<br>
My understanding is that SWPA is now the objecting to the new proposed allocations due to prior contracts.  (Baxter Bulletin article a while back on public meeting held in flippin) <br>
<br>
Since Senetor Hutchinson has been replaced by Sen David Pryor there has been a meeting with him to bring him up to date on the situation by some of our locals.  Senetor Blanch Lincoln is already fully aware and has said publicly that she is behind the effort.  (I fished with her aid two years ago and received a letter confirming her support of the study)  Now that the study has been done another obsticle has presented itself.  SWPA.  In my opinion an outdated leftover ABC quasi governmental agengy of the 2nd Roosevelt administration.  <br>
<br>
The &quot;Contracts&quot; they speak of will of course bring another fight with another agency (SWPA) which is more political than the COE.  SWPA has lots of lawyers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  get to fish them every year in the fall.  (Should probably dry hole 'm eh???)<br>
<br>
Rick.  Has this particular O'2 option you speak of been proposed????  I think everyone on the river regardless of where they stand on other regs or anything else is ready to get behind increasing O'2 levels on these waters..<br>

He has probably forgotten more about these issues than I will ever know.<br>
<br>
As far as minimum flow is concerned, I am happy to see anything that will improve the fishery. I am very concerned about what it will do to wade fishermen such as myself, I might be in favor of minimum flow as it would relate to &quot;maximum water temperature&quot;. <br>
<br>
My personal feeling is that there is considerably more damage being done to the fishery from low oxygen than anything else. I'm afraid that all minimum flow will do is just add to that effect when we have low DO levels in the lake in the winter time. <br>

How would we go about finding out when the dam is up for licensing? From what you have said that would be our best negotiating tool. What can we do to effect a change? Is there some chance that even if they have received a new license that we might still have some ability to effect policy on this issue?<br>
<br>
There was some sort of decision made several years ago that assures minimum water quality below those dams. SWPA has taken the burden to assure those minimum levels. Are there other sources of funding as well? Could there be some sort of grant available? Maybe even a TU project? Do you have any sort of a guess as to what it might cost?  <br>

Forgive my ignorance but what is the term &quot;hypolimnetic&quot; when you described the intake on the dams?<br>
<br>
Also, what is &quot;benthic decomposition&quot;? <br>
<br>
Sorry, but you'll have to dumb down a little for me to be able to understand. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The Cougar Dam on the South Fork of the McKenzie River in Oregon has either recently been, or is in the process of being retrofitted with multi-level intakes.  The e-mail sent to me from Oregon today actually said &quot;multi-level outlets&quot;, but I think they meant intakes to the turbines (and thus outflow to the river).  The South Fork below the dam (impassable) is the &quot;last best place&quot; for Threatened wild spring chinook in the Willamette Basin, and they weren't doing too well.  Turns out after construction of the dam, the river was warmer in the winter than in the summer, because of a hypolimnetic release.  Oops, sort of messed up their life-histories a tad!!  You might be able find more information on a COE website.  <br>

Sorry for any confusion!  Hypolimnion is lake jargon.  The study of lakes is called &quot;limnology&quot;.  Most large mid-latitude lakes will thermally stratify during the winter and summer.  When lakes stratify during the summer, the upper (warmest) part of the lake is called the &quot;epilimnion&quot;, the bottom (coldest) part of the lake is called the &quot;hypolimnion&quot;, and the transition zone between the two is called the &quot;metalimnion&quot;.  OK so far?  Now it gets interesting.  During the winter, it is the other way around, the lake does not stratify into three distinct layers, but has a gradual thermal gradient from warmest at the bottom, and coldest at the top!  Confusing, eh? <br>
<br>
This seeming contradiction is due to the fact that the maximum density of water is at 4 degrees Centigrade.  So, when mid-latitude lakes stratify (whether winter or summer), the water at the bottom of the lakes is 4 degrees C (it is really a density stratification, not a thermal one).  So, during the summer, the warmer, lighter water is higher up in the water column.  During the winter, the lighter, cooler water (from 3 to 0 degrees C) is higher up in the water column.  Isn't physics great... it even extends BEYOND the physics of fly rod loading!  <br>
<br>
The term &quot;benthic&quot; just means something associated with the bottom of a river, lake, or ocean.  <br>
<br>
I promise to be better at defining terms as I use them!  <br>

Like John I am concerned about minimum flow and its effect on wade fishing.  Also Rick any idea if the minimum flow were to be put into effect would it cause a decrease or an increase in the type of fish food...what would it do to the scud and sowbug population in the rivers, etc?  Taz minimum flow equates to a certain flow release during times when there is no generation.  Right now its a political hot potato so to speak.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=danoinark@flyfishingarkansasandmissouri>Danoinark</A> at: 2/8/03 9:01:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rickgolden@flyfishingarkansasandmissouri>Rick Golden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Environment Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#000000>(2/9/03 9:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DO</span><hr size=1> Dano,<br>
Good question.  I expect that a minimum flow minimum flow requirement would probably increase the standing crop of the invert community (more area that doesn't get dessicated = more inverts).  But as to it's effect on a specific invert, I don't know.  It would be hard for me to imagine that the overall effect would be anthing but good!  <br>
<br>
I think that the camp concerned with wade fishing is stuck with some tricky philosophical questions about tradeoffs between benefits for trout ecology vs. benefits for trout fisherman.  How do you (and others concerned about minimum flow effects on wade fishing) see this?  What do you think the &quot;ideal&quot; situation for minimum flows would be?  <br>

As one who has alot of respect for natures wonders, including trout, then I am more interested in the ecology of the fish habitat than I am my own selfish interests.....but I sure would miss wading the local tailwaters if minimum flow were to cause too much water and dangerous wading conditions.  Now, I will say should that occur, then wade fishermen will adapt with the help of excellent fishermen and guides such as John, Jimmy T, and Andrew.  They will come up with a system for fishing the minimum flow without using boats.  I have that kind of confidence in these piscatorial pursuers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=danoinark@flyfishingarkansasandmissouri>Danoinark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#000000>(2/9/03 10:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DO</span><hr size=1> Oh, ideal conditions...I don't know Rick (forgot to include this in the last post)  I know I have successfully fished Taney with one generator on (even wading), and there was enough water for boaters and waders and both were successful.<br>
Maybe that type of situation would be perfect.  I have also thought that maybe if the bulk of the generation came at night this might be another option...but I don't know how SWPA works.....only that I feel that the Dam's purpose of power generation being the number one priority I don't think it will make much difference that a handful to a bunch of people wanting to get out in the middle of a river and throw pieces of hair and feathers to some fish will make a political hot damn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyfishar>FlyFishAR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#000000>(2/9/03 10:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://boards.justflies.com/Images/4/4551Photo1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DO</span><hr size=1> Rick:<br>
<br>
For me &quot;ideal&quot; would be enough to protect the fish from high water temps in the summer time, and that's all. I can see little value of a &quot;maintained&quot; minimum flow other than the increase in general habitat. That argument carried to a logical conclusion would indicate that having the water run 40 feet deep 365 days a year would be the most benificial to the trout. While that certianly may be true, it would certianly harm the fly fishing.<br>
<br>
I am all for protection of the habitat, and increasing the flow to do so. But I am not for the loss of my way of living in the process.<br>
