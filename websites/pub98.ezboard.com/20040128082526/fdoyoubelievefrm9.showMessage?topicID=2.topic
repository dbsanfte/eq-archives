Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they shall be granted you. “And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your transgressions.”<br>
<br>
Phil 4:13 I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.<br>
19 and my God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
Ps 27:1,3 The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?<br>
<br>
Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall nto fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.<br>
<br>
Ps37: 3-5 Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.  Delight yourself in the Lord; and he will give you the desires of your heart.  Commit your way to the Lord, Trust also in Him, and He will do it<br>
<br>
Ps41: 1-3 How blessed is he who considers the helpless; The Lord will deliver him in a day of trouble. The Lord will protect him, and keep him alive, and he shall be called blessed upon the earth; and do not give him over to the desire of his enemies.  The Lord will sustain him upon his sickbed; in his illness, Thou dost restore him to health.<br>
<br>
Ps51: 1-13 be gracious to me, O God, according to Thy lovingkindness; According to the greatness of Thy compassion blot out my transgressions.  Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.  For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.  Against Thee, Thee only, I have sinned, And done what is evil in Thy sight, so that Thou art justified when Thou dost speak, and blameless when Thou dost judge.  Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me.  Behold, Thou dost desire truth in the innermost being, and in the hidden part thou wilt make me know wisdom.  Purifty me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  Make me to hear joy and gladness, Let the bones which Thou hast broken rejoice.  Hide Thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.  Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.  Do not cast me away from Thy presence, and do not take Thy Holy Spirit from me.  Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.  Then I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and sinners will be converted to Thee.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ps55: 22 cast your burden upon the Lord, and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.<br>
<br>
Ps57: 2 I will cry to God Most High, To God who accomplishes all things for me.<br>
<br>
Ps91: 5-6 You will not be afraid of the terror by night Or of the arrow that flies by day; Of the pestilence that stalks in darkness, Or of the destruction that lays waste at noon.<br>
9-10 for you have made the Lord, my refuge, even the Most High, your dwelling place.  No evil will befall you, nor will any plague come near your tent.<br>
 <br>
Ps103: 1-3 Bless the Lord, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His holy name.  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of His benefits; who pardons all your iniquities; who heals all your diseases;<br>
<br>
Ps121: 7-8 The Lord will protect you from all evil; He will keep your soul.  The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forever. <br>
<br>
Ps140: 1-2 Rescue me, O Lord, from evil men; preserve me frrom violent men, who devise evil things in their hearts;<br>
4 Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from violent men,<br>
<br>
Eph6: 10-18 Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of His might.  Put on the full armor of God, that you may be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in heavenly places.  Therefore, take up the full armor of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everythng, to stand firm.  Stand firm therefore, Having Girded your Loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one.  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.  With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petiton for all the saints,<br>
