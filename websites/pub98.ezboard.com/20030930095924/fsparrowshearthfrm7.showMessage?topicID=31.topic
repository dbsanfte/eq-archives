If God is speaking to us-in our spirit or through another person-His Word will always support it some way. Satan, on the other hand, is the father of lies, and there is no truth in him. He often disguises himself as an angel of light, sowing seeds of doubt and deception everywhere he goes. I have found that one of the greatest ways to determine if we're hearing from God or from the enemy is to ask ourselves a simple question: Is what I'm hearing causing me to doubt God's Word or believe His Word? Think about what Satan first told Eve:..And he (Satan) said to the woman, Can it really be that God has said, You shall not eat from every tree in the garden? (Genesis 3:1). Satan put a question in Eve's mind-a question that cuased her doubt God's Word and eventually commit sin. Any time we have thoughts that cast a shadow of doubt on God's Word or what He's spoken to our spirit, that's a major clue that the thought we're hearing are from the enemy.<br>

<br>
Yes Satan can put thoughts into our mind because we are told to put on the helmet of salvation so that we can deflect the poisoned darts from the enemy. Whether he can read our thoughts is debatable. He has however had a long time to study us and know us very well so maybe it is not that important whether he can read them or not. He has had enough time to work them out in all of the situations that we get ourselves into and he watches how we react to his ideas he puts to us. I think that it is rather demons that speak to us rather than Satan although he must give us special attention sometimes if we are a threat to him. But he cannot be in more than one place at the same time.<br>
<br>
I agree with dd that we can test what we think we hear with what scripture says but for day to day listening we must know the voice of Jesus and recognize it because we know Him to that extent that we straight away are confirmed in our spirit and anyway we know the sort of things that He *might* say in the same way that we know what our marriage partner will say because we have learned their thought pattern and their opinions.<br>
<br>
But there is a danger of relying too much on checking with scripture and it is indeed possible to know God's voice without having a copy of the Bible. The early church did not have one for hundreds of years and even if they did they would not be able to read it and which version anyway? There are still languages which have not had it translated into, so there must be a bigger answer for what the Word of God is. Actually it is Jesus. If we do have scriptures though, we certainly need to know them, but not as our ultimate authority. That must be Jesus and hearing Him speak to us. If we are confused about whether it is Him then the answer is not to study the scriptures more but to get to know Him more. We do not find eternal life in the Bible but they witness to this life as the writers also were in the same spirit.<br>

this is an interesting thing that i've wondered about.  when i was born again i didnt have a bible of my own for a while. and after i went to a couple churches and got invovled in groups of people i started to think it was like they worshiped the bible more then god. i asked someone about that and they told me its his word..which i understand. so its hard to explain what i exactly mean when i say it was like they worshiped the bible. maybe if it werent so early i could do a better job!<br>
<br>
but all that made me think of people before they had access to bibles since the printing press or even to teachers.<br>
<br>
one thing i came up with was thats one reason we even have the bible. it seems like much of the NT is letters written to christians who were doing things wrong because they didnt have understanding.<br>

<br>
Your intuition was right and it is easy to worship the Bible and put it in place of the true Word of God and begin to live without the direct and immediate guidance of the Holy Spirit and to grow further and further from this until we use the mind to interpret scripture. I believe that the Protestant church made this mistake at the Reformation as a reaction to the claims of the Catholic Church over where our authority lies.<br>
<br>
Of course we should not accept anything that contradicts scripture but it cannot be our final authority. It is the mark of an apostate church that turns to another source to settle matters (with the results that we have over 2.000 denominations)<br>
<br>
Yes I agree that the letters were written to those who were getting things wrong but they point to Christ and say it is through being obedient and being led by the Spirit that we know God not through studying or legalism. The new law is to be written in our hearts not on paper.<br>
<br>
I am not discrediting scripture and believe that we *must* study to make ourselves approved but it is the secondary rule of guidance not the first and will protect us from hearing other voices and not recognizing them.<br>

<br>
But this is why there are so many denominations. How do you know that your interpretation is the right one if you are not referring to the witness of the Holy Spirit telling you what is truth and what is not? If that is the case then you are going beyond scripture. How did you know when you first came to Christ that you had found the truth? It was through the Holy Spirit telling you. This is the rule from the start and to the end.<br>

<br>
By reason, logic, and by starting with fundamental Christian truths.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In systematic theology doctrine must accord with doctrine. ...<br>
<br>
This law, while imperative, neither leads us away from the authority of Scripture nor lands us in a sphere of mere speculation.  All Christian doctrine, to be true, must be scriptural.  Doctrines in a system, to be true, must be accordant and scriptural.  If discordant or contradictory, some one or more must be both unscriptural and false.  Hence <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>this law of a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>scientific</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> accordance in vitally related truths</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is consistent with the profoundest deference to the authority of revelation in all questions of Christian doctrine.<br>
<br>
This law may render valuable service in the construction and interpretation of Christian doctrine.  As we may interpret Scripture by Scripture, so may we interpret doctrine by doctrine.  Only, the interpreting doctrine must itself be certainly scriptural.  As such, no Christian doctrine can be out of accord with it.  In any distinction of standard or determining doctrines, preference should be given to the more fundamental; especially to such as are most certainly scriptural.<br>

Man has developed 'systems' right from the start and depended on his intellect to know the will of God. However scripture itself says<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape, and ye have not His word abiding in you for whom He hath sent ye believe not. Search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of Me, and ye will not come to Me that ye might have life&quot; John5:37-40<br>

<br>
God made the human mind.  Jesus was the most brilliant intellectual of all time.  Paul was so much of an intellectual that he was once accused of being mad.  John was surely one of the profoundest thinkers ever to live.<br>

<br>
Not just Protestants Eugene but everyone. I am not decrying the intellect but we are talking about final authority. Wesley did not agree with you on this. He said that three things were necessary, scripture reason and the Spirit. I put the Spirit ahead of the other two but the other two are vital.<br>
<br>
&quot;On what do you base that assertion? That few agree with your opinions?&quot;<br>

The few that do not contradict scripture. Saying that scripture is final authority contradicts scripture.I am not right on everything.<br>
<br>
&quot;The verse you cited refers to unregenerate Pharisees.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes but also legalists who say that scripture comes first. Many Christians have not had scripture. <br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>But here some one perhaps will ask, Since the canon of Scripture is complete, and sufficient of itself for everything, and more than sufficient, what need is there to join with it the authority of the Church's interpretation?

For Novatian expounds it one way, Sabellius another, Donatus another, Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius, another, Photinus, Apollinaris, Priscillian, another, Iovinian, Pelagius, Celestius, another, lastly, Nestorius another.

In figuring out if it is indeed the Holy Spirit or another, discernment is called for, and reason is not a good judge of the matter, what St Vincent wrote is a sure guide to the truth of the matter.  Our Lord said that the Holy Spirit would guide the Church, as a whole, and St Paul said the Church is the Pillar and bulwark of truth.  <br>

I consider myself Wesleyan-Arminian.  I do not consider myself a disciple of John Wesley.  Whether Wesley agreed or disagreed with any of my beliefs is not the issue.

How come Barnabus did not make the cut, or the Shephard, or 1 Clement?  At times Revelation and Hebrews were disputed along with 2 Peter, so those made the cut the others did not, and it was the Church who stamped them with approval.  <br>
It stands to reason if the Church gave birth to the New Testament there is something besides Scripture that is the authority, and that is the Apostolic Tradition.  The faith once delivered.  That is why St Vincent is clear that just because there now was a canon, did not mean everyone could read into the text what they wanted, it had to be tested against the teachings of the Church.  <br>
