I knew no better place to put it, since it's readily avaliable in-character if one goes looking.  No, kine can't get ahold of it, unless you're a ghoul of an Acknowledged Kindred.  Crafted with Expression 3. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Can this be made sticky, Blackjack? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ))<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THE FIRST: The Masquerade</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Thou shall not reveal thy true nature to those not of the Blood. Doing such shall renounce thy claims of Blood.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
What does this mean?  It means.. do not reveal that you are a vampire.  Not to Lupines, Mages, Fey, Hunters, humans, anyone except your own kind.  If you are attacked on the street, and you use super-human disciplines that defy what humans consider &quot;reality&quot; ... you might as well stand and fight to an honorable death, because if you live, you will be killed for violating the First Tradition.  This is all the more encouragement for being secretive and staying indoors, in Elysiums, in safe, secluded places with good security.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THE SECOND: The Domain </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Thy domain is thine own concern. All others owe thee respect while in it. None may challenge thy word while in thy domain.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Respect the owner of the house, building, or place you are in.  My domain is Santa Carla, if you stay here, you agree to uphold the rules I set and respect my rule.  This applies to anyone who has a Domain.  Respect them, respect their rules, otherwise, don't enter the Domain in the first place.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THE THIRD: The Progeny</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Thou shall only Sire another with the permission of thine elder. If thou createst another without thine Elder's leave, both thou and thy progeny shall be slain.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The right to create progeny within this Domain is mine to grant.  This applies to Ghouls as well as Chider.  If you create progeny without my consent, you and your progeny will be Bloodhunted.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THE FOURTH: The Accounting</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Those thou create are thine own children. Until thy Progeny shall be Released, thou shall command them all things. Their sins are thine to endure.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This means, you're the parent, and your Childe is.. well.. your child.  If they mess up, it is YOUR responsibility to fix it, and discipline them.  If they violate Traditions, be aware, you may be expected to kill your Childe for the safety of the city and your own self.  And yes--if your Childe breaks the Traditions, you, too, may be held accountable for it, and killed.  This is the case in breaches of the Masquerade and Destruction. Teach them well, teach them right, the Traditions and how to uphold them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THE FIFTH: Hospitality </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Honor one another's domain. When thou comest to a foreign city, thou shall present thyself to the one who ruleth there. Without the word of acceptance, thou art nothing.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
When you enter a Domain, announce yourself.  This is required of all Kindred entering any city.  If you break this rule, you will be punished, and possibly killed.  As it says, without the ruler's word of acceptance, thou are nothing.  At that point, you have not placed your trust in me to introduce yourself and show me respect, I must consider you a threat at that point because I know nothing about you.  You will be treated as a threat.  I cannot keep a Domain safe if I do not know who is within it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THE SIXTH: Destruction</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Thou are forbidden to destroy another of thy kind. The right of destruction belongeth only to thine Elder. Only the Eldest amoung thee shall call the Blood Hunt.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This one is a no-brainer.  Do not kill any Kindred, no matter what, even in self defense.  I cannot help you if you violate this Tradition, at all.  If another Acknowledged Kindred--this does not apply to Sabbat or Anarchs or unrecognized Kindred--attacks you, you should seek to defend yourself as best you can without bringing about Final Death.  If you do cause their final death, you will be held responsible for that final death depending upon the circumstances of the attack.  Destruction of known Sabbat, Anarchs, or unrecognized Kindred is allowed, but Kindred are encouraged to contact the Prince prior to destruction of any Kindred to ensure they are not, indeed, violating the Sixth Tradition.  Final Death is indeed very final, and f you violate the Sixth Tradition, you will be Bloodhunted in my Domain.<br>
<br>

-=-=-=-<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Giovanni</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - The Giovanni are to not be dealt with, associated with, or spoken with, except through my prior approval.  They have safe passage through our Domain, and ours through theirs.  If this is regarded, punishments will be given out on par with the nature of the violation.  (( OOC: Insert map, with clear lines showing Giovanni Domain versus Santa Carla. ))<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Supernaturals</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Supernaturals include Fey, Lupines, Mages, and other such things.  The policy is non-involvement, with very little exception.  Those who disobey this safety measure without my permission will be dealt with accordingly.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Domains</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> -  Domains are granted to supporters of the city and my princedom.  They are usually a building or a block, a prime example being The Silver Saloon, Mr. Blackmor's new Domain.  When a domain is granted, a level of priviledges will be granted with them.  To clarify, this does not make a Kindred precisely a Prince... however, they may have the right to enforce to certain Traditions on their Domain.  Anyone who holds a Domain is beholden to the Prince, much in the same as a vassal is to a king, and is expected to uphold the Prince's laws and policies while on their Domain.  The First Tradition is to be respected and understood by all Kindred, regardless of who's Domain they enter.  The Second Tradition is granted with every Domain.  The right to the Fifth Tradition may or may not be granted.  The Traditions that will NOT be granted, unless under extreme circumstance meriting such things, are the Third Tradition, the right to create progeny, and the Sixth Tradition, the right to destroy another Kindred.  Additionally, a granted Domain from myself may not be then divided down and granted to another.  No domains within domains within domains.  Only my domain, and those I grant.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Camarilla membership</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - I have been going from city to city, attempting to feel out our current situation.  I was treated nervously, but welcomed par tradition.  We are still on the Camarilla charter, though we are the &quot;low man on the totem pole&quot;, so to speak, in light of recent events.  With a strong governmental structure, and patience, we will again be in the good graces of the Camarilla.  Status and prestige throughout the Camarilla will come to those Kindred who have assisted in bringing this city back to its former glory from the ashes of anarchy.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Elysium </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->- Elysiums are reinstated, and I have Key Cards for all acknowledged Kindred.  This is in case of an emergency, and you find my club locked down--it will allow you access.  The key code is changed every week, please be sure to call me, email me, contact me in person, or otherwise send word through one of my officers that it is still in your possession.  Notify me IMMEDIATELY if it is stolen or lost.  For those who do not have my number, it is here.  Try to use land lines when you can--cellphones are easily intercepted.  My club, The Black Swan, is Elysium.  The Silver Saloon is also Elysium.  Another Elysium will be created, one that is neutral grounds, and owned, or inhabited, by none of us.  It will be safe and protected, but will take time to make.  Prophet's club, The Underground, is also Elysium.  The museum down at (**** st, ******) is Elysium, with Alia as the Keeper.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>City officers</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - The Officers of the city are as follows: <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Seneschal</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> : Grifon Blackmoore.  If you need to contact me at all, and you are not a Primogen or an Officer, contact the Seneschal FIRST.  Grifon Blackmoore's contact information is (********).  The Seneschal acts with my authority and speaks as the Prince when I am not present.  It is imperitave that you all follow this chain of command.  There will always be a ruler in this city, be it myself, or Grifon in my stead.  I have granted Grifon the right of Destruction in my absence in the Domain, however, he has stated he will consult me before doing so.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Scourge</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Prophet.  The scourge is charged with hunting down thin-blooded childer, sire-less kindred, and Anarchs who enter Santa Carla.  They are also empowered to hunt down and kill Kindred in the Barrens or Outlands of Santa Carla that are squatting here, unannounced, unacknowledged.  The Scourge is an encouragement to introduce yourself, par the Fifth Tradition.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sherrif </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> : Trevor.  He is a capable and trusted Kindred who has long served this city.  The position of Sherrif is a demanding one, and this city must have a capable enforcer at all times.  I believe Trevor is more than capable of handling this honor, as his past deeds have shown.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Keeper</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Alia currently holds this position, for the Downtown Elysium.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Please note that if any officer does not follow through with their public duties for 3 weeks in a row or more, they will be replaced.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>((OOC: This means, if you don't show up at game in character for 3 or more weeks, barring extreme real life circumstances, a replacement will be found.  I really need my officers in-game, the city needs their officers in-game. ))</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Gathering </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->- I encourage you to gather and congregate--but indoors, and out of the eye of the public!  Keep in mind your own safety, and The Masquerade.  This city has a high population of Hunters.. and they *are* watching.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Senseschal</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - If the Prince needs to be contacted by any non-Primogen Kindred or officers, they should contact the Senschal FIRST. Provide the Senschal's contact information.  The Seneschal acts with the Prince's authority and speaks as the Prince when the Prince is not present. It is imperative that Kindred follow this chain of action.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>New Kindred/Introduction</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Please contact the Seneschal to set up a meeting with me for formal introductions.  I am a real stickler for courtesy and protocol.  All arrivals to Santa Carla must have an established Camarilla Kindred to vouch for them, else they will be subject to a different &quot;introduction&quot;.  Those without the aforementioned vouching will have to undergo a background check at the very least, and possibly extensive mind probes, though I truly hope to avoid that.  This will be done before even meeting me.  Even then, they will undergo a 1 month &quot;trial period&quot; whereby they will be observed within the city, and evaluated for membership into this Domain.  During this time, they have no status.  Please keep in mind, those new Kindred who have a Sire, or another official from a previous residence, will NOT undergo this trial period, merely need to be introduced.  Upon arrival, new Kindred should contact their Primogen as soon as possible.  Primogen are encouraged, and may be required at the Seneschal's or my own request, to run private background checks, and check up on their fellow Clansmen as they see fit.<br>
<br>
Do not bring Unacknowledged Kindred to any Elysium without prior consent with me, or with the owner of the Elysium, or the Keeper of the Elysium if there is no owner.  They must pass through Mr. Blackmoore before I will even consider it, the only exception being officials or representatives from other Domains who do not reside within Santa Carla.  This goes double for my Elysium, I will not have my esteemed Populace threatened by unknown wild cards, I want to know exactly who is being let into the area I call safe for my Populace.<br>
<br>
I have stated it before, but I will reiterate it.  No Kindred with a personal vendetta or mission to Hunt or Kill other Kindred Clans or supernatural races will be allowed to remain in Santa Carla domain.  No exceptions.  Those caught with such intents will be dealt with accordingly.<br>
<br>
