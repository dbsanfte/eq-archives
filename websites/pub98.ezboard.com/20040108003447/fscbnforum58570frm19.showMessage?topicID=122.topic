Branches of the largest trees on the edges of the property where dripping in Spanish moss and lingering mist.  As soon as the rising ground was dry enough however, long heavy rushes, pampas grass and cattails gave way to cleanly manicured lawns and neatly pruned trees that bloomed with giant heavy magnolias and powder puffs of mimosa at the proper times of year. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The large house gave off an air of fragile dignity.  White paint tried to hold it’s own against green lichens and the hinges on all the screen doors and window shutters whispered murmurs of caution against rust at each use.  The swing on the front porch was hung from both lengths of chain and rope, obviously whoever had put it there had not been sure which would weather longer.  The whole allure was that of an antique bone china teacup, beckoning use and touch, but obviously about to fracture at the slightest misuse and absolutely going to draw blood with it’s broken shards.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Inside was surprisingly sturdy and solid with nothing of the ephemeral beauty of the exterior.  Deep old wood panels covered walls that seemed as enduring as the finest stone hall.  Plush deep carpets of jade emerald and russet wool denied that any damp or mildew could penetrate this sanctum.  Light held and flickered in each luxurious room, from parlor to pantry, library to attic.  More like captive willowhisps than flame or electric filament, always on hand to perfectly light any page, yet only casting the most flattering of glows to any face.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The mistress of the house was a perfect embodiment of this contrast.  She curled in her favorite overstuffed leather armchair in the study.  The leather squeaked softly as she shifted her slight weight, tucking her stockinged toes underneath her and pulling the soft chenille throw closer to guard against the aching chill of her sorrow.  For once completely undistracted by any research, enigma or conundrum in the face of heartfelt loss, Chastity St. Bride furrowed her porcelain doll brow behind the delicate wire rim glasses perched from habit on her face.  The one gone on had not been hers, but she had deemed him an ally and counted on his presence when the final battle broke.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A tremor of awareness fluttered through the house and Chastity shook of her gloom and looked to the shallow scrying bowl on the table next to her.  The mirror surface of its contents clouded and then cleared to show a page written in a deliberate and driven hand.  Chastity straightened and tucking her blanket around her hips leaned over the arm of the chair to read the message.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Dearest Gra’mere,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Please pardon the tardiness of this message.  You know that I would not miss reporting to you the trials and progresses of your family without good reason.  I hold faith that this will find you still safe and sound.  I miss New Orleans, even with its inherent dangers, and I am sad that we did not get to pass the mad-dog summer nights with you.  I have planted the night blooming jasmine here as you suggested, and regret that you may never get to see it grow.  My humble little house will never hold a candle to yours, but I had hoped to show it off to you. <br>
 I am sure by now you have heard of our losses.  Dumbass had survived so many situations at this point; I for one was beginning to believe him untouchable.  The other however I do not think any of us could have predicted.  This may have been the last straw for Ari, I am not sure if I can pull him out of his downward spin.  In saying this I realize how long it has been since you heard from us.  I have been truly remiss, as I’m pretty sure now that the last time we spoke was just after Ari’s return to Santa Carla’s rule.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It would seem that those things, which you have spoken to me of before, will soon come to pass.  And I for one am eager to attempt your plan at this point.  I am not sure how much longer I can watch my Sire break himself.  The combined blows of having to be the instrument of destruction of his best friend, and being stripped of all that he has worked for and tended so conscientiously, by those he has bled himself dry to serve above the needs of himself and his Domain, I fear may have fractured him beyond repair.  Perhaps if it had not followed on his self perceived responsibility for hundreds of deaths; perhaps if the Domain which he has devoted himself to did not seem to rise up and fight him at every step and turn… perhaps he would not have taken this hurt so deeply.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’ve taken him out of the Chantry after a thorough house cleaning and now we can only wait to see whom the Pyramid sends to crack whips over us and dole out head loppings.  The ghouls are nervous and the few gargoyles we have managed to hold onto are moody.  I held my own in Europe, against all challenges.  I faced everything House and Clan threw at me no matter what.  But now I fear.  How can Arman hold a domain with an incoming Regent who we cannot depend on or trust? How can I leave the Chantry ghouls to someone else’s tending and watch as my Gargoyle friends are treated as stock, chattel and cannon fodder?  I have taken in Ash’s ghoul and given her the week to decide between Ari and myself.  Part of me hopes that her presence may help bring him back, and part of me fears that he will devour her with little provocation.  But at least she will not be left in the Chantry.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I too am pushed to my limits.  I was raised to be a social decoration and then trained to be a soldier.  Neither of these gives me the skills of a politician.  I have lost a mentor, and cannot turn to my Sire.  I’m keeping the Chantry and Clan as well as I can… not hard as the ghouls have little to do but dust and keep their heads down, and the only one left besides us is Stone.  I put him out of the Chantry until I could figure out how to deal, but I suppose I will leave it to him to greet the new Regent, after all I will be hard pressed to hold my tongue, and Ari has no standing left.  I must still find some way to serve the City and protect its denizens until Ari comes to his senses and releases us from this geas.   <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As soon as he does, we will come to you, I will make sure of it.  I will not continue to give myself to a system that treat’s him so shabbily.  That is if we survive this insanity.  I cannot say if I will have the strength to not follow him to final death.  Even your welcoming haven may not hold enough pull to keep me on the path if he falls…  They took everything Chastity!  I am so glad you cannot see him crushed like this.  They are lucky that he is not a fierce Prince, a warrior Prince, or they surely would not have survived the evening.  But I am only ranting, for there is truly nothing we could have done.  They took until he had no more to give and then stripped him and tossed him to the wayside.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The strong hand faltered to a halt.  Chastity threw off the blanket and began to rise, determined to go rescue her brood.  Then the letters scratched and skittered across the distant page again…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Please sweet Gra’mere, send us your strength and your faith, but stay where you are no matter what.  We will survive this and make it to you, or meet our end trying.  Stay and hold steady for us.  The light from the porch on the bayou will call is home.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The image flickered and the scrying bowl surface returned to mirrored garnet.  Chastity St. Bride lightly tread the length and breadth of her house.  She checked the wards and lit sweet scented candles with words of ritual protection and devotion.  She sent calls to a couple comrades, beacons of warning and preparation.  Last she went to the room that she kept waiting for her childe, and her childe’s childe, checking that it was ready as she did every day.  Smiling a small smile, somewhere between sadness and acceptance, defeat and rebellion Chastity made a mental note to remember to get the guest room ready as well.  Hart would certainly bring Ash’s survivor with her when she brought Arman, and the girl would need a room.  She had thought to go to bed early, but instead she took a lantern out to the porch and set it on the railing next to the stairs.  In a husky slightly off key voice she sang in French Cajun patois, a lullaby.  The Loa would take it to her childe and ease his mind.  The world might fall but she had no doubt that she and her brood would not fall with it.  The Pyramid would surely fall, it had rotted and eaten away it’s own core, and she would not let it so waste the blood of her blood.    <br>

The one she used to use when she wanted to look like she wasn’t paying attention… before her turning… before she’d grown teeth.  She used to carry around her favorite cds the ones she new all the lyrics on, so that she could sing along softly.  It had been great cover; she’d sat in on meetings and gatherings of all sorts and looked disinterested and distracted, and after awhile they had stopped paying attention to her, stopped asking why she was always there.  Even when she misplaced the walkman and went around without it, they hadn’t questioned anymore.  She had learned more about them than most of them ever bothered to even notice about themselves.  It served her well.  When you move you always find something you’ve misplaced or forgotten about.<br>
<br>
Now she had it again.  And it served her.  She used it to help tune out her Sire’s constant mumbling and ranting.  She was fairly sure that it was better than the previous week’s silence.  She was very much trying to look at it as a step forward, progress, healing.  But it was FRELLIN annoying.  Especially considering he spoke twice as many languages as she did, and could read several that no one spoke anymore, but he apparently found it amusing to rant in, in his own interpretation.  She’d had Emily pick her up new earphones that were nice and comfy for long wear.<br>
<br>
Right now she was perversely enjoying Johnny Cash’s version of “Hurt”.  The night before some 14-year-old wannabe Goth twit, not even old enough to understand Nine Inch Nails was before their time, had been ranting at the coffee house about the injustice of “some icky old Country Western geezer dishonoring Trent Reznor’s vision”.   Luckily the young tasted pretty good when seasoned with frustration and righteous indignation, and she’d had fun draining the idiot to submission and then sitting them down on a lecture on American cultural heritage.  The little twit had sat quietly and listened about how Cash was an original rebel, a tarnished knight who championed music without caving to stereotypes.  She was pretty sure that the little git would not be disrespecting the original Man In Black again.  It had taken the edge off her frustration and indignation too… well maybe a little bit.  But she always had liked educating people… maybe she should have gone into teaching instead of supernatural studies.  She missed her self-defense classes.  Teaching them had always involved just as much reprogramming of the idiot men who showed up thinking to pick up on women, as teaching those silly girls to stand up for themselves and walk with a purpose.  Which reminded her, she needed to sit down with Emily and make sure that one could take care of herself as well, or at least knew which end of a tazer was which.<br>
<br>
So she scooted around the house trying to feel busy.  She arranged her books and research in the den.  She reset the timers for the house lights.    Still to do: checking on the folks back at the Big House, and reporting into Grandma that there had been no real change.  Bike?  SUV?  Bike?  SUV?  The bike, she decided.  The SUV reminded her too much of Ash right now, bells, whistles, tinted armored glass.  Frell, but Hart missed the AssHole, who was going to make her laugh and buy her huge overpowered presents she didn’t need?<br>
  <br>
The cd ended and she listened aimlessly to the soft spinning whir as it wound down.  Hart went for her gloves and helmet.  Out of the corner of her eye she saw Arman sitting like a woebegone child at the bottom of the stair.  “Cher?  Ah ya goin out Cher?  Mwen malad.  Mo la… do-do. Dey is beaucoup crasseux, but it don matta, they ah still mine, and I’m fixin to get better, sure I am.”<br>
<br>
“Ki sa se bon.  I miss yat too.”  She hauled him to his feet.  SUV, she wanted him buckled into a seat.  When you move, you always misplace something that you really feel you need.  Something you have to learn to live without.  She put the walkman on the shelf next to her helmet.  You learn.<br>
