She could feel it in the back of her skull, like a spider dropping down the collar of her shirt.<br>
She had successfully avoided the Kindred population of this City she was sure. From everything she knew, and that was not much, they would read her like a book, see that she was filth and destroy her.<br>
Maybe she should just submit, and die. But she wasn't quite ready yet. She wanted answers. She wanted to understand.<br>
She needed to move on before they caught up, but something about this strange city held her. It reminded her of the one who had brought her into this mess in the first place. Well, she knew he would never have meant for *this* to happen. But he *was* the one who had drawn the dark ones' attention. She could only hope that her sacrifice, her death had made time for him to escape, had been enough of a warning to get him out of harms way.<br>
She let the name she had chosen for herself play in her head. Nicolette Lore. It was better than the crap she had been called by the dark ones, when they had even bothered to give her a designation rather than a punishment. She thought he might like it, not exactly her own name, but then she was dead... so...<br>
Maybe he was out there somewhere.<br>
Maybe they would find each other and everything would be ok. Questions would get answered, doubts be put to rest. Surely together they could face her hunters.<br>
The memory of him gave her faith, the rememberance of his honor and love of music and learning told her that she could somehow win some good out of this travesty of unlife. Somehow she would survive the running and the fear.<br>
They were coming for her.<br>
They were close.<br>

Perhaps the wind would pick her up like a paper doll and toss her up on some other shore. She had not realized that she would feel Thomas' passing, but it had wrenched her heart and soul as surely as if she had seen it and held him as he faded. She barely had the power to hold herself together anymore. The strange twins had let her back out onto the streets, and she had floundered, not knowing what to do, surely those who had been responsible for the demise of Nikke Black would not have taken her in. The wind changed direction and she drifted with it. The dark ones still sought her, but she was so transparent and distraught she did not see them and they did not see her. She felt the growling purr of her beast as it rose up within her. Should she give in? Try to pull what was left of herself together and approach one of the factions of Kindred who were bastioned on the edges of Santa Carla? Allow the dark ones to find her, take her back, and strip her down to the tool she had been made to be?<br>
&quot;Thomas? Why couldn't you have held out a little longer? I didn't know you were so close? Were we on the same streets? Did you have friends that I could go to, to at least feel you near? I am so sorry I missed you. I miss you.&quot;<br>
The beast chuckled and purred. The wind blew, and the two played a hollow duet on her soul.<br>

She watched and listened as she was tossed, dipped and passed from one breeze to the next. Her dance card was full, and she could find no way to pull herself from this engagement.<br>
Then something caught her attention and she managed to duck out of the next pass, swaying in an eddy of current drafting around the large old mansion.<br>
The figure had been here awhile.<br>
He had waited patiently and silently outside wrought iron gates for more than one night.<br>
And they let him in.<br>
The stone monsters shifted and noted him. They announced his arrival to those within. They watched. And he was let in.<br>
Some time later he was let back out.<br>
He looked none the worse for wear.<br>
She did not know who he was.<br>
She had not seen him before.<br>
But he had not been turned away, ignored, or killed outright.<br>
Perhaps this was the sanctuary she sought?<br>
It was not as busy and active as the other compound.<br>
Something about the old stone and the still sense of permanency attracted her.<br>
She joined the eddying drafts that played about the high strong walls, careful not to touch or trespass, watching for awhile, listening. She did not learn much. The stone beasts shifted and took turns watching. The occupants moved confidently with knowledge of their places and duties.<br>
When a sudden gust of wind pulled her from the local currents, she had a renewed sense of hope. Slowly she began to pull herself together, gently she pulled bits of mass to herself so that she could better control her travels on this tide. <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All of the strange ones from the calm orderly mansion, including their new addition/adoption had gathered with the other chaotic ones in the museum downtown.<br>
She brushed past it, and as a draft sucked her paperdoll body over a nearby building she noticed the one who had drawn her attention earlier trying to catch up with her. &quot;Miss?&quot;<br>
Interesting, but she did not have enough inertia to control her movement yet. And when she was dropped into the nightlife on the main drag, she was immediately caught up in the buffet and jostle of the crowd. Besides, she was still not sure she should be found.... *by anyone*.<br>
The dark ones continued their sweeps. The busy busy ant hill that she had now learned were &quot;Giovanni&quot; noticed and made adjustments, but the mess within the City proper still didn't seem to worry about anything but their own petty squables.<br>
They stayed in the museum all night. She was not sure why. But she had not enjoyed all the things in the windows around that area yet, so she ghosted back and traipsed about.<br>
Her reflection, cold hard and crisp on the glass windows around the area seemed more solid and real than herself. She found a place where the air currents were mostly predictable and surfed the drafts watching the population of Santa Carla. Perhaps she had indeed become invisible. None of them noticed her. They brushed past busily involved in themselves, paying her no more attention than any of the mortal travellers on the streets.  <br>

It took so much energy to stay calm and focused. The City was such beautiful chaos. Holidays added such flavor to hunting and feeding. But they were not allowed, they had to keep their appetites in check.<br>
Searching...<br>
Searching...<br>
Oh the prey was tricky. The chase was sweet. Only the barest sent of the prey, only the merest taste, just enough to tell them it was here somewhere. But careful as they were being they could not get closer. <br>

She new she shouldn't have stayed. Whatever strange impulse had kept her from leaving this backwards City would now be her doom.<br>
The dark ones had completely closed off the City. Whether it's populace new it or not, there was now no way for her to leave without drawing their attention.<br>
She had no idea how she had managed to avoid their sweeps. She hid herself so often surely she would think herself right out of existance soon. She spent most of her energy blending in. When she wasn't hidden she imitated mortality for all she was worth.<br>
She felt the shift of the dark ones' watchfulness and worked very carefully to look normal and active. She remembered a quote from something. '...nothing to see here, only a hedge...' She hummed the latest pop tune on the charts and thought about commercials and public events.<br>
Careful to draw no undue attention she made her way into one of the few public restrooms. Shutting herself in a stall she indulged in a couple moments of silent sobbing. She came to a hiccuping stop when she realized that she had been faking humanity enough that tears were actually rolling warmly down her cheeks. She blotted the red tinged drops from her face and flushed the stained paper. With a last sniffle she hurried out, peering carefully in the mirror to make sure she had not ruined her image too much. The porcelain perfect image peered back at her. Swiftly she added some makeup to look more real, less still and cool.<br>
She wasn't giving up yet. She wasn't gone yet. There was something here. Something that mattered. Something that held her. Somehow she would find it. Somehow.<br>
She owed his memory. Just because her heart no longer beat, that didn't mean it didn't feel.<br>
Perhaps she would take some of them with her. The dark ones who separated her from her companion and brought her into this unlife.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hart@scbnforum58570>Hart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#FF9300>(3/13/03 3:58:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Nicky!&quot;<br>
She took a deep deliberate breath and turned smiling to her approaching companions. It had taken all the courage she could muster to resume her old habits. Habits that both assisted her masquerade and allowed her to observe the 'regulars' of the City. This evening meant college students. They were easy to blend in with, easy to gain the trust of, and easy to keep up with even when one was distracted and upset.<br>
The college students settled around her with books, java, smokes and sugar. Their young boisterous presence was comforting. She found their patterns and mimic'd them settling in, while keeping an eye on those of the City she had taken to watching.<br>
Some of them were obvious, some of them merely guilty by their association with the obvious. Would any of them help her? Would they consider her enemy theirs? Was it worth risking herself to approach them. Could they even take care of themselves? She didn't know them, was it fair to bring her troubles down on them to assist herself?<br>
She had been alone for so long, keeping only the most casual of aquaintances, chameleoning to her surroundings. The memory of true companionship was beginning to fade.<br>
The college students got up to move on with their evening. She rode their wake, reflexively fading into the background. When she felt herself forgotten she peeled off from the group. She willed herself out of notice, intangeable, invisible, not worth attention. She listed and floated with the crowds of people on the street, drifting like a ghost. Finally she settled outside the club, watching the comings and goings with studied disinterest. Certainly one of these would appear approachable.<br>
So used to going unnoticed she nearly jumped out of her skin at the rough voice that growled at her from the shadows.<br>
&quot;Who the hell are you and what are you doing in my City.&quot;<br>
Heart almost startled back to use, she looked up at the threatening figure. A high collared black trench with cyber hardware closures draped a formidable blond whose hair was pulled back like a ronin from and old samurai movie. For a moment she forgot to be scared, stunned by his preternatural gorgeous features. However the fear kicked back in as he continued to speak, all hostility and threat. His voice was gravel, and his perfect mouth moved as if speaking was a newly learned skill. &quot;Who are you?! You are not acknowledged here! Why are you watching us! You better have some really good answers really fast, or you're mine, and I haven't gotten to kill anything this week.&quot; His face twisted in a convincing leer, and she didn't doubt the danger to her unlife. She recognized one of the locals who patrolled the City regularly, making better sweeps than the packs that chased her ever did. She had barely managed to escape his notice until now.<br>
&quot;Sabbat, chasing me.&quot; She managed to gasp. He looked around swiftly, shoving her farther back in the shadows. His aggression transfered from her to the unknown of the night. &quot;I don't have anywhere to go anymore.&quot; He grinned, and it was a grim reckless expression that warred with the anime perfection of his preternatural face. <br>
&quot;Well,&quot; a chuckle dredged from his throat, &quot;then I guess it's a matter of how good of bait you will make for some hunting and house cleaning.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hart@scbnforum58570>Hart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#FF9300>(3/13/03 4:04:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Under the watchful and twistedly humorous eye of the Scourge of Santa Carla, she again joined the crowds of people inhabiting the night of Santa Carla. He shepherded her towards BlackSteel milling casually with the others. <br>
For a moment she thought they were going to go in the front door. Then at the last moment he grabbed her arm. Pulling her into the thick of the crowd, he zags towards the shadows, yanks her around a corner and hits a sewer grate at speed. <br>
With a muted ring of metal darkness surrounded her. Just as she is about to ponder where he might have learned such dodgy avoidance techniques, she is propelled into the darkness, and fear overwhelms her.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The doors locked.<br>
Closing her in.<br>
For the first time in longer than she cared to remember she felt safe.<br>
The room was luxuriously plush. Whoever's it was did not have tastes that met her, but there was no doubting that it was made for comfort.<br>
The Prince's concerns had been completely founded and understandable. She could not begrudge being locked up.<br>
The Prince was going to help her.<br>
Hearing the name Thomas had shaken her. But it was not an uncommon name. And surely if he had been here, he would have found her already. Surely that uncanny connection of heart and sould they had always shared would have alerted him to her presence.<br>
She shook off the melancholy.<br>
Shedding the layers of clothing she had worn to keep off rain and prying eyes, she settled in to wait for the Prince's return. <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Days later, she was getting worried. No one had come back for her.<br>
The well appointed room had a blood supply she discovered, tucked in the back of the small bar fridge. But it was only a few days worth. Just enough to take the edge off waking each evening.<br>
There was a tv, a stereo, it was warm and comfortable. But the ruler of the City had told her she would be back soon, with a decision, a plan, and others to talk to her. And now days had gone by, with nothing.<br>
Was it a cruel joke? Were these &quot;civilized&quot; vampires as bad as the dark ones for torture?<br>
Sometime early in the wee hours of the morning of the 4th or 5th evening, she heard the locks release on the door. A strange mechanical voice came over the hidden intercom.<br>
&quot;Shoo, now, out out.&quot;<br>
&quot;But Nikke told me to stay here until she came back with a plan?&quot; She turned a slow circle in the room, not sure where to direct her confusion.<br>
&quot;oooooh no&quot; the strange computer voice almost moaned, hiccuped and then there was static.<br>
&quot;Get out you silly cow.&quot; The rough gravel voice she recognized and she jumped, but it too came over the intercom. &quot;No one is coming back for you. Nobody cares, or even knows you are here.&quot;<br>
Cautiously she pushed open the door. The club was almost totally dark, just a couple security lights on. An exit sign flashed, drawing her attention. She hesitated a moment and then plunged back out into the night, alone. The doors locked behind her. There were a couple hours until dawn. She would find a place to hide.<br>
Then what would she do? This had been her last chance. <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The pack milled and paced.<br>
They had seen no success. <br>
There had been only punishment, no reward.<br>
They were driven time and time again back into the City, but their prey was ellusive. They were not allowed to sate themselves on what was readily available. <br>
Now the master, their driver, came among them. They cringed and fawned to his face, hissed and snarled at his back. He snapped the neck of one he caught in disrespect, and threw it to the rest of them. It was blood. Blood was good. That was good enough to hold their attention.<br>
He would stay with them now. Stay with the hunt, hold it on track. <br>
He would see how hard they had tried, how tricksy was the prey.<br>
They would find it. <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
She shuddered, and barely had the mental facilities to duck out of sight, as she saw the Pack Leader walk down the street.<br>
She had taken it for granted that she could keep up this game, and started to delibrately collect mass again. Her camoflage was not nearly what it had been even the week before. And now she was faced with a master hunter.<br>
One who took her escape personally.<br>
She burnt blood to color herself, flush with &quot;life&quot;, and force a thudding beat into her heart.<br>
The pack would not be far from their lead. His presence would flog them to a new frenzy.<br>
Again she went over her choices. The quiet blood mages who seemed to command a certain privacy and respect within the quiet of the City. The brutal regimented ant-hill that was the Giovanni. The vicious gravel voiced sewer angel who again stood protector of the chaotic City. Stand and fight. Flight.<br>
None of it looked good.<br>
Catching the next breeze she started moving again. A breathy whisper floated behind her, her only strength.<br>
&quot;Thomas&quot; <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nicky, watched the strange new family she had been introduced to.<br>
Life was settling for the first time since she had lost Thomas... Jack was working diligently at trying to make her feel at home, which was funny, because it was all she had as home... and all she needed. &quot;The girls&quot; took some getting used to, but it felt right, it would work, it gave her peace. She was trying not to unsettle the other's too much, she had to learn to not shift so much around them, it seemed to upset them all.<br>
She tried to keep a bit of an eye on the Tremere, Ashheart ripping blood from her to decide if she was real or not still made her a little nervous. And Nathan was much too interested in having her move in and settle.<br>
She had been free and on her own for too long.<br>
The City folk had reacted explosively to the *direct* report of Sabbat activity... not to any great success... but at least they were no longer complacent. Surely they could not have been completely unaware for this whole time? Nicky thought it more likely a case of them all keeping their heads firly buried in their... the sand.<br>
Jack was grinning at her warmly, and the Tremere were earnestly trying to keep her attention on something. A breeze whispered through, cool and clean, ocean and city colored. Rolling her eyes at the Tremere, she beckoned to Jack, gesturing to the great outside. Jack grinned wider and made for the door. She stepped onto the offered breeze and swept out the window.<br>
Gargoyles watched her covertly as she ghosted by. She stepped onto a different gust to circle back to Jack waiting for her at the gate. Perhaps tomorrow night she would see if any of the Gargoyles were free to play... who else could come up and out with her?<br>
&quot;Lori!&quot; Jack called up, and she hurried down toward it. &quot;Nicky, sorry.&quot; It chuckled, a warm familiar sound. The Girls had shifted the vocal chords to older patterns, and now she could hear Thomas all the time. She shook her head at it, dismissing the apology. If faces did not matter, then names didn't either.<br>
She kissed it deeply, appreciating the work that had been put into this new visage, reveling in old bonds renewed. Then taking it's hand she dragged her mate out into the night, fearless and joyful for the first time in forever.<br>
