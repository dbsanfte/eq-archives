Hey, I couldn't get one with the hep b vac either. Tried it three times and nothing. I was told it was because my body was naturally resistant to it. So maybe that's the case. Can't build up an immunity if you can't get infected. <br>

At what point should their be a line drawn?&quot;<br>
<br>
People should be as free as they want to practice their religion as long as this practice doesn't physically harm others, and it isn't considered harrassment by being pushed off on others.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Health care - should parents be allowed to refuse medical treatment for their children if it goes against their beliefs?&quot;<br>
<br>
This is when it starts to harm others.  Refusing a life saving medical treatment for a child is negligent and unfair to the child.  However, I know there is also a fine line when it comes to parental negligence and parental rights, and this is a hot topic with the vaccine debate.  I used to post on the immunization debate board at BC before I got bored with it.  Some people state religious reasons for choosing not to vax, but a lot of times people will just check that off in order to avoid getting crap from authorities.  The concern over forcing vax or any medical procedures on the family is that there might be instances where refusing the procedure is better for the child, but the bureacracy involved can screw things up.  Eventhough I'm totally pro-vax, I know there are legitimate reasons out there for not vaxxing the child such as family history of allergy.  If the govt forced the vax procedure on this family, then it can put the child in danger because the child will be vaxxed while the parents are fighting to get through all the red tape and display their family history of allergic reaction.  In my experience on that board, there were a few parents on there whose either had a family history of reaction or one of their own children had a reaction, but the main reason I saw that people chose not to vax was because of all the anti-vax sites on the internet that put scare tactics into their head.  Nobody on that board made their choice based off of religion, eventhough I know they are out there.  When it comes to black and white cases of &quot;give this child surgery or they will die&quot;, then I get really riled up because the child has no way to fight for their life.  The parents just sit by and watch the child die because of their religion.  That is going overboard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Circumcision - should this legally be allowed and what of female circumcision?&quot;<br>
<br>
I am in the minority here because I did have my son circed.  It wasn't for religious reasons, and we didn't even have a bris.  The doctor just did the quick snip at the hospital the day after he was born, and he is fine.  I didn't really put much thought into it to be perfectly honest.  My dh has no complaints, nor do any other men I know that have had it, and I just figured that I'd follow suit with what my dh had, and that it was good because of hygienic reasons.  I've never been much interested in debate on this topic because I don't think it hurts a child either way, regardless of what choice the parent makes.  I know people here have differing opinions, and I can respect that.  I guess it is sort of like vaxxing, when the majority of people you know have had it done without any negative effects, then you don't get so worried about those negative effects.  I feel that female circumcision is a different story.  There is no debate over whether there is better hygiene or less UTI's.  Female circ is done to deprive the female of sexual pleasure, and it causes horrendous health problems, not to mention the fact that sex goes beyond just not being enjoyable for the women that have it, but sex becomes downright painful for the women that have it.  The procedure is also usually performed in a very painful manner.  My son had an anesthetic applied, and he was back in my arms in no time, and in a perfectly fine mood afterwords.  Female circ usually involves tying a girl or teenager down in a state of fear and slicing into her with a razor blade.  No pain meds, no nothing.  They just go Benihana on her.  Ouch!<br>
<br>
&quot;What of some of the more fundelmentalist Islamic sects? Should a woman be allowed to have her picture for her driver's license be taken with her head and face covered?&quot;<br>
<br>
We had a debate about this on the In The News board quite a few months back.  DBC67 made a good case for no longer needing to have pictures on a license.  However, I feel this needs to be a universal rule, and not just applying to people of one religion.  Driving is a privelege, and you don't get special treatment just because you choose a certain religious path.  If it is deemed optional to have a picture on the license, then I couldn't care less if she opts out of it.  If it is required for the rest of us to have our pics on there, then the woman in question damn well better comply, or she can scrap her privelege.  I just want to see the same rules apply to everybody.  It is also this woman's choice to take her covering to this extreme, and since she has chosen this path, then she may have to miss out on a few priveleges that require identification.  I could also be wrong, but I'm not sure that covering to that extent is required anywhere in Islam.  I know Islam pushes modesty, and it is up to the woman to decide what she considers modest (in this country anyway).  In Saudi Arabia full covering is mandated for Muslim women no matter they want to do it or not, or at least that is how it was as of not too long ago.  But women aren't allowed to drive there anyway, unless it is in a rural area.  Kate could correct me on this stuff if she is reading this.  But my point is that I don't think you need to be covered to that extent in order to be an observant Muslim.  Many rules surrounding Islam are mandated by the dictators and monarchies running the Muslim states, and not by the religion itself.   <br>
<br>
&quot;What about some of the more fundamentalist christian sects that raise girl children to be nothing more then child-bearers (granted IMO) complete with arranged marriages?&quot;<br>
<br>
A lot of people screw up their kids, regardless of religion.  There are nonreligious women telling their daughters how to latch onto a guy as we speak.  I think that regardless of the reason, this whole process is wrong.  Women should have the same opportunities and choices as men, and I do find it disturbing that parents trick their children into thinking otherwise by scaring them with hell.  &quot;You want to be a doctor?  Fine, but you'll go to hell&quot;.  This also gives men carte blanche to treat their wives how they see fit.  This behavior is wrong no matter you are religious or not, but religion does help to justify the action.  A nonreligious person might know deep down that this behavior is wrong, and they might try to cover it up in front of nonapproving parties.  But a religious person can stand tall and proud while squashing their daughters down because they are right and God said so.  Blech!<br>
<br>
&quot;Part of some christian sects is witnessing - something alot of us non-christians find highly annoying and in some cases down right harrassing - at what point does it stop being religious freedom and becomes harassment?&quot;<br>
<br>
Being sneaky about pushing info on us, like brainwashing our kids when we aren't around, goes beyond religious freedom.  Grabbing a woman in public and telling her she is a whore for wearing pants and then proceeding to tell her how to save herself is harrassment.  Knocking on someone's door to push your &quot;product&quot; and then continuing to push it when the person says &quot;no thank you&quot; is harrassment.  Freedom of religion is being able to light a Menorah in your home without being dragged out and burned at the stake.  Freedom of religion is for Muslim women to wear a head covering without anyone telling her she can't.  Freedom of religion is for a family to wake up and go to the church of their choice on Sunday.  Freedom of religion is also to be able to sit down by yourself and really contemplate what you do or don't believe without being thrown in jail.  When it comes to Christian witnessing, I guess they have the freedom to inquire whether others are interested, just like people would do with any idea system, but once someone says no, then leave them alone.  Pushing Christianity off on others is rude if they don't inquire about it first, but telling a Christian they can't inquire on their own infringes upon their freedom of speech.  I can go up to someone in public and ask if they are pro-choice, but if they say no, then it isn't right for me to sit there and tell them they are wrong at that given moment. During a debate process is one thing, but to go up and push the issue at a bus stop or something, and then not let up once they express their view goes beyond freedom of speech and heads into harrassment.<br>

you keep mentioning that a woman cannot comment on the circ issue, especially concerning sensation, because she has no penis.  you have also mentioned that you are circd.  and you mentioned that circd males have higher sensation.  <br>

i dont think you are able to comment on this issue either.  unless youve had sex as an uncircd male???  if not, then you have no idea whether you and other circd males have better sex.  and therefore have no platform to stand on in that respect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=filfilksq>filfilksq</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/17/03 10:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How Far Shouls It Extend?</span><hr size=1> &quot;I could also be wrong, but I'm not sure that covering to that extent is required anywhere in Islam.&quot;<br>
<br>
There's a difference of opinion among the scholars on this.  Some state that everything but the hands and face must be covered, some say that everything must be covered, face included.  That is really the extent of the debate.. here in the US there has been some debate as to whether or not you have to cover your hair, or if you can leave your ears open, can you wear a baseball cap, etc. etc.  But this is a newer discussion.<br>
<br>
The debate about driver's licenses is a little moot since each state comes up with it's own requirements.  Most require photos, but not all (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.oktagagent.com/drivers.htm)">www.oktagagent.com/drivers.htm)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
I don't know whether states are going to be willing to come up with a national standard, or stick to their individual preferences.<br>
<br>
I think as long as reasonable accommodation is made, everyone should be able to get along.  I personally cover to the extent that only my hands and face show, no neck, ears or what have you.. now back when dh was still working his way through the naturalization process, they required a photograph of me with an ear exposed... in this case, the INS stated that the form of the ear is as distinguishing a feature as a fingerprint (actually more so), which is why it is required that one be seen in the photo (you have this kind of 3/4 view, not totally forward facing).  I understood the reason behind this, and because the gov't worked with me to the extent it could (allowing my hair to remain covered, etc.) and everyone was nice about it, I didn't have issues with complying.. if people were nasty about it, maybe I would have gotten nasty too.<br>
<br>
Now if we're talking Saudi that's a whole other kettle of fish.  I would definitely say that many of their laws are things they decided on, then tried to find religious justification to get people to go along with it.. like the no driving for women.. also, not even ten years ago, women didn't get their own passport, their names were simply listed on the passport of their nearest male relative.  I believe this has since changed, but I'm not sure about the photo issue.  When I visit there (and I do cover my face there) they have a separate room with a woman who checks your passport photo against your face to make sure it's you.  When you give the passport to the customs man for stamping, he immediately flips it over to the back and opens it that way, looking for your visa, such that he won't see your photo.  I don't know if that's regulation, or just his personal habit. <br>
<br>
Oh, I did also want to mention that the time I came through US customs with my face covered after a visit there, the customs agent was extremely polite and they immdeiately found a female agent who escorted me to a private room to check my face against the photo.  This I have no problem with.  I do have a problem with the girl who was travelling through Chicago O'Hare who was stopped at a baggage check, harassed by the IL State police, then forced into a separate room where a female agent put her hands down her pants... that's not in the spirit of mutual respect and cooperation. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/jan2002/chic-j21.shtml">www.wsws.org/articles/200...-j21.shtml</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
(not excited about this whole site, just giving a news article for reference)<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's a long post for me to say that I think as long as everyone is being respectful to the extent they can, then that should be allowed.  Many of the Islamic laws are not operable here, well officially anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (polygamy, marrying cousins, etc.), but in my opinion if you don't want to work with the system -- not saying have your rights trampled on, but to be reasonable and work for reform where needed -- then you don't need to be living here.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Circumcision - should this legally be allowed and what of female circumcision?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
My son was circumcised at birth, and I have no regrets, nor do I feel like he was mutilated...but I wanted to really get a personal opinion on this instead of just what some studies say...so I went to a source...my best friend, whose husband was circumcised shortly after their son was born.  Here is what she told me...<br>
<br>
****************<br>
&quot;Rick did it because (after we started having sex) his foreskin would crack and get infections.  The foreskin is more likely to hold bacteria and takes a lot more care. The doctor suggested he have it done at the same time he had his vasectomy.  I've had it both ways with the same guy, and let me tell you, he smells and tastes much better without it! Too much information?<br>
<br>
Rick says it has not reduced sexual stimulation, but rather has increased it because the foreskin doesn't come between the head and vagina wall (better friction). As far as mutilation goes, God would not have us mutilate our children.  And He's the one who told us to do it. Sure it's unnatural. But so is piercing your ears, plucking your eyebrows, and bikini waxes. And don't tell me there's no pain there.<br>
 <br>
I suppose there's no real biblical reason to do it today. Jesus spoke of circumcision of the heart being more important than circumcision of the flesh. And you have doctors on the pro and con side. So I guess it's a matter of choice. We had Keith done because as a baby it heals much faster and they don't remember the pain.  Rick does!  We also didn't want him to have it done later in life if he were having problems too.  He'll never know the difference. I would have all our boys circumcised at birth, if we had anymore.  No questions in my mind!<br>

I personally prefer the &quot;living witness&quot; way of doing things.  Instead of standing on a street corner yelling scripture at people walking by, or telling people they're going to hell because something they may have said doesn't line up with my beliefs...people are going to see my Christian witness by the way I live my life during the day.  Now that doesn't give me an excuse to not defend my beliefs, you know I can and will do that till the day I leave this earth.

I really think its wrong if a parent refuses medical treatment for their child if it goes against their beliefs....IMO I def wouldn't reject treatment if it meant life and death for my child....i would disown my belief before I let my child die because my belief didn't allow medical care...<br>
<br>
circumsision...i really dn't see the harm in it at all...while it is done as newborns....yes it is prolly painful for the child...but it is the choice of the parents....and i really don't see how it decreases pleasure for males...seeing as my dh is circ. and he has plenty of pleasures lol...for a woman it does take away all pleasure...and i really don't think that is right<br>
<br>
im torn on the women who wear things over their face and heads....IMO if you live in the US then you shouldn't have it covered for licences...it is a form of id and it can easily be stolen and used as someone else all you have to do is wear something over your face....so no it shouldn't be allowed even though it is their religion...<br>
<br>
arranged marriages...hmmm tough one...i for one would never have my child be in an arranged marriage but i odn't see the harm in it if the child says its okay....if the child has no say in it then its wrong!   just think back in the day all they had were arranged marriages<br>

for me it is harrasment when you let them know that that is not your belief and they still continue to push it on you...like me as an atheist i would find it harrasment if anyone i knew tried to push god on me them knowing that i do not believe....im lucky i havent had anyone from any church or JW's come to my house yet!   <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200302072217315237.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200302072314304891.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200301262024144142.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200301261856110893.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200302072302473751.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-2-200302081046167760.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200302081046154807.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200302072323326680.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200302081055132522.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-2-200302081055139385.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://babyzone.com/upload/BabyBooks/B/B4B999CD-1-200302081350453942.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lafuzes.com/Blinkies/Lesley/timmcgraw2.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Timmy is all in thanks to Lesley! thankies!<br>

<br>
So your best friend's personal sexual preference was reason enough for you to cosmetically alter your own son's genitals at birth? I don't imagine you are planning for her to be his lover at some point. So I guess this means you assume your best friend's sexual preference is valid for all women, including your son's future wife. Why? Personally, I wish doctors had left my husband intact (for reasons that, yes, are too much information for a public forum.) Suffice it to say sex would be more comfortable for both of us were this the case.<br>
<br>
It sounds offensive to even ask this (sorry) but I think it is parallel:<br>
If your best friend's husband thought she &quot;tasted better&quot; after she'd had her labia removed for some problem, would you then then have your infant daughter's labia excised as well in hope that she would taste better to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>her</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> future husband? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Rick did it because (after we started having sex) his foreskin would crack and get infections.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It was his right to make this decision to alter his genitals as an adult when it turned out his foreskin gave him problems. This is wholly appropriate. What I don't get is extrapolating it to another person, an infant, who has no say and also has no problems with his own foreskin and most likely (statistically speaking) will never have a problem with it. To put it another way, I can't think of one other normal, healthy, functioning body part we would amputate &quot;just in case&quot; there might be problems later or -- simply for cosmetic reasons that reflect our personal sexual preferences.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Rick says it has not reduced sexual stimulation, but rather has increased it because the foreskin doesn't come between the head and vagina wall (better friction).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This makes sense when you take into account that Rick's glans, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>having been protected by the foreskin his entire life</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, would still be soft and sensitive. However, when the foreskin is removed at birth, the glans are exposed to constantly rubbing on diapers, underwear and so on and they become keratinized, losing sensitivity. This accounts for they dry, greyish, helmet-like appearance of the glans of adult males who've been circed at birth (and what seems &quot;normal&quot; to those of us married to men born in the generation where nearly all were circed), and also why men who choose circ as adults may indeed experienced increased sensitivity for a time. <br>
<br>
This is from a medical article at nocirc.org:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Circumcision desensitizes: Circumcision desensitizes the penis radically. Foreskin amputation means severing the rich nerve network and all the nerve receptors in the foreskin itself. Circumcision almost always damages or destroys the frenulum. The loss of the protective foreskin desensitizes the glans. Because the membrane covering the permanently externalized glans is now subjected to constant abrasion and irritation, it keratinizes, becoming dry and tough. The nerve endings in the glans, which in the intact penis are just beneath the surface of the mucous membrane, are now buried by successive layers of keratinization. The denuded glans takes on a dull, grayish, sclerotic appearance.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sure it's unnatural. But so is piercing your ears, plucking your eyebrows, and bikini waxes. And don't tell me there's no pain there.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, the difference is these are all personal choices made by adults. I didn't pierce my ears until I was 37 and had my first really short haircut. I've never had a bikini wax and wouldn't force one on my daughter. Also, these examples do not involve amputation of a functioning body part.<br>
<br>
Candy, (and Stacy too) having said much against circumcision in recent posts, I just want to say that I realize we live in a culture that routinely circs at birth and your seeing it as &quot;no big deal&quot; is NORMAL for our culture. I know many, many really good, thoughtful parents who have circed their sons - including ALL of my own sisters and some of my best friends... so please don't think I am on some moral superiority trip for having left my son intact.  I just wish more people really understood this issue better - and I wish doctors didn't offer up the foreskin as an &quot;optional&quot; to begin with. <br>
<br>
Respectfully,<br>
DL<br>
<br>
Edited to add... the &quot;smelling and tasting better&quot; after circ was most likely because Rick's foreskin was prone to cracking and infection. Normal healthy foreskin is not offensive.<br>

I asked this because someone made the point above about Mikey being circ'd and not being able to tell a woman she couldn't have as good an opinion as he did since he could not recall sex with one.  When faced with my kid's decision, I read a lot of the literature and pro/con info out there on it and wondered myself.  I was circ'd and neither recall the surgery nor feel cheated.  I love sex and it gave me pause to wonder if it could 'be even better' that it already was.  What I did know was that my family has a history of priapism and when my nephews were born, they weren't circ'd and it ended up being very painful and they ultimately had to be cut when they were older.  When it is done later on there is a great deal more pain and likelyhood of complications. My wife took the position that she wasn't going to do it to her son and if I wanted it done I would have to sit there through it with him.  I have friends who are, I have friends who aren't, ultimately, I decided to err on the side of caution and have it done rather than face the pain and long term damage that could occur were it not.<br>

I think to extent you’re right. For me there are a lot of things that parent’s do that I find distasteful. Do I think those things should be illegal, no. As far as this subject I personally don’t see a need to do it so I wont if this baby is a boy. I am just not comfortable with making non-life threatening decisions about my children’s body parts.

This myth just keeps rearing up so I have to address it. Circ done at birth is done without general anaesthetic and often without even local anaesthetic.  The foreskin is adhered to the glans at birth and must be forcibly ripped away from it before it is excised. In a word, ouch. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Babies who &quot;sleep through it&quot; actually have passed out from the pain.<br>
<br>
Circ done later in life is done <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>after</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the foreskin and glans have naturally separated. It is done under anaesthetic - at a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>minimum</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a very good local anaesthetic and the patient can communicate to the doctor is it's not enough. (Unlike the newborn, whose probably just crying because he doesn't like being strapped in that cold circumstraint...) The circumcised adult isn't peeing all over his wound as the baby must. The circumcised adult has access to pain medication after the procedure. The circumcised adult understands the procedure, unlike the baby who cannot possibly fathom why you hurt his dick.  <br>
<br>
If this does not fully communicate to you why adult circumcision is actually LESS PAINFUL and LESS TRAUMATIC than infant circumcision, then I give up.<br>
<br>
The key difference is, the baby can't effectively communicate his pain, and he can't remember the incident later, therefore, we are excused. Great ethics.<br>

They have it performed at age 3 to 5. The separation period is acompanied by painful urination and tearing of the foreskin compounded by frequent infection. The opening is too small for retraction and any stimulus the boy experiences is increadibly painful. By comparison, a new born infant just had his whole body mashed thru an opening way too small for it, his whole body is still forming including the nervous system, he will have no memory and care can be controlled and maintained by his parent. Yes, he may be peeing on it, but this can be protected against with application of vasaline, whereas an active 3 year old is not so readily protectable, is far more active and frequently ALSO still peeing on it. In either case, general anestesia of a child is a VERY risky measure, and local anestesia was used.  <br>

Did I dismiss it casually? No. I researched it thoroughly and came to a valid conclusion for my situation. Is it a mountain out of a molehill? yes. Language like <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Babies who &quot;sleep through it&quot; actually have passed out from the pain</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are categorical generalizations and would call for substantive evidence to support them, it smells of propaganda as much as mandatory requirement would.

Even the observation about sexual pleasure can be rebutted with the desensitizing prolonging the love-making and increasing the pleasure he gives.  Just the same as implying that the child not remembering it is unethical.

It seems to me you are the irrational one here. You preach it as a no possiblity acceptable situation. It isn't like we are amputating hands or I am advocating everyone must do it. I had a valid medical concern that I further have a family history for. I saw what some nephews went thru circed at birth and what others went thru circed later on. It to me is similar to removing webbing on toes or fingers or a vestigal tail. We prophylacticly remove wisdom teeth, tonsils, and other parts before they cause problems.  Especially when there is a family history or forseeable problem to arise.  I know many others who did have their daughter's ears pierced, the little flap under the tongue cut and pediatric tubes put in their ears.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry for you if you feel your relationship with your dh was adversely affected by his circ, but when you extend your circumstances to my decision for my son, you are the one guilty of knee-jerk reactions.  My wife and I will be faced with many decisions for our child: schools, religions, ethics, medical, and more until they are old enough to emancipate and support themselves, until then, we ARE the owners.<br>

You are right DBC. If Rick was circed at 30, he might expect the same level of keratinization by the time he is 60, that he would have had at 30 if he'd been circed at birth. DBC, relax and open your mind for a second. Take a deep breath. Now, run your tongue against the inside of your cheek. THAT is roughly the equivalent of the texture your glans would be if it were protected by a foreskin your entire life. Now imagine sex with that sensitive, tender tool and ask yourself, &quot;why not&quot;?<br>

Interesting. Isn't this one of the rationales for female genital mutilation - cut off her clit and she'll focus on YOUR pleasure rather than be distracted by her own...

Somewhere deep in his subconcious, perhaps he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>would</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> remember it regardless. In fact, studies have shown that circed boys cry louder and longer than uncirced boy and girls when given vaccine shots. They seem to be more sensitive to pain thanks to that early imprint.

You show me where I said that! I never said that. Quite the contrary, I said it was totally appropriate in Rick's situation.

As a lactation specialist, I can tell you this truly is &quot;just a snip&quot; and is done when the frenulum is too short to permit breastfeeding. I personally wouldn't put it on par with circ, as frenectomy removes nothing and simply make the tongue function properly.

DBC, my dh was needlessly circed when he was a 4 lb preemie. There was no dotted line that said &quot;cut here&quot; on his little wee wee.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

I plead <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not guilty</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. You can do whatever you want to your son, he is the ONLY person you have to answer to. It has no effect on me.  With your family history, you have better reasons than a lot of parents who do it so the kid will &quot;look like dad&quot; or ridiculously, &quot;smell better.&quot; You saw what your nephews endured with later circ, you saw your son through newborn circ (you were in the room, right?) and you feel newborn circ was the saner way to go. You've far more experience than I in all of this! You weighed the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>possibility</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of your son going through a circ at 3 against the lifetime value of his foreskin, and the foreskin lost. I get that. It's okay DBC. You had your reasons, the doctors required you to make a choice and you did. You don't owe me an explanation. Really.<br>
<br>
I tried to make that clear in an earlier post to Candy (that a lot of parents I really respect have circed their boys). I also want to make clear I am not trying to make circ illegal and have never said it should be. Not once. (I'd hate to see the resulting back-alley circumcisions if it was illegal.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It to me is similar to removing webbing on toes or fingers or a vestigal tail.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
I'm just amazed that in this country, the foreskin is offered up like some optional decoration, or like some vestigal birth remnant. It's more than that. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Functions.html">www.circumstitions.com/Functions.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

Now, that I've shown you mine... please show me your web links to &quot;functions of the vestigal tail.&quot;<br>
<br>
BTW, every boy is born with a foreskin. Webbed toes and vestigal tails are far more rare. It really does smack of propaganda when you equate the foreskin with these birth defects. One of my nephews was born with an extra finger attached by a tiny thread of skin. They circed him right away, but left the finger on for 6 months. Logic, or insanity?<br>
<br>
Now, back to the RELIGIOUS debate... I wonder, is God circumcised, or does he still have his foreskin? If he is circed, I wonder, who did it for him and where God's foreskin is now? Is Salt Lake City actually God's foreskin?<br>

While I do wish I had pushed DH harder on the issue, or even outright refused it, I have to say that one of the reasons why he had it done was because of how viament the anticirc advocates are. <br>
<br>
And while this has no baring on why we circed DS, I can not imagine DH being more sensitive then he is now....he is too quick circed, can't imagine if it was more sensitive! But that has nothing to do with why we did it. I did not think that a flap of skin was worth adding another battle to our marriage over. <br>
<br>
I can tell you that my circed son rarely cries. During his head surgery he astonished the nurses and the doctors over how non-crying he was - until that one night. Ugh. Would you believe for head surgery (they cut part of his skull out) they only gave tylenol? We had to BEG to motrin on the one night when the pain just got to him and when he had horrible gas from the anastesia. Of course it would be the night the time changed so I felt it lasted forever and ever. Tylenol and Motrin for head surgery. Yeesh.<br>
<br>
Also they used a local on my son, he did not cry at all, nor did he fall asleep. The lady who did it said my son was the first that ever just simply watched her while she did it. <br>
<br>
Still, if we ever have a second son, I'm going to have to think long and hard about this. I don't want it done, but I do worry that not having it done now would give teasing material to the older son. But I don't want to do again. <br>
