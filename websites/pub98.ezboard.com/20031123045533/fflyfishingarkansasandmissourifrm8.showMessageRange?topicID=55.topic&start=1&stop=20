<br>
I'm planning on visiting the White River for the first time this weekend (driving in from Oklahoma).  I plan on getting there late evening/night on Friday.  I may be getting there late depending on work so was looking for advice on cheap motels.  I will then camp most likely on Saturday night if sites are available.  Can anyone make suggestions on this?  I'll need a license/trout tag too.<br>
<br>
Now, the fun stuff - fishing!!  Let me preface this by saying I'm a newb.  I've only been casting a few weeks and been out on some still lake water on a couple of occasions.  I've taken 2 lessons from a local votech and my flyshop so hopefully I'm getting good instruction.  My casting is progressing as I can make fairly nice loops out to about 35-40 ft but it starts getting ugly after that (darned tailing loops!!) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   My presentation still needs lots of work.  What would be your suggestion on places to fish that are vehicle/walk-in access only (I have waders)?  If money were no object, obviously a guide would be great but I can't afford it this trip.  <br>
<br>
I've been reading the posts here and trying to pick up as much as I can but it can be pretty overwhelming.  It looks like sowbugs and scuds are a good choice for flys.  What's the best way to fish these and should I have other flys as well?<br>
<br>
I just read back over my post and man, I asked a lot here!  Sorry for the long-winded post.  I'm really excited about checking out you guy's great looking river.  Who knows, I'm might even catch a fish!<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
Richard<br>
<br>
Oh, and by the way...<br>
<br>
My local flyshop (The Rivers Edge here in OKC) recommended travelling to the White instead of trying the Mtn. Fork or Illinois here in Oklahoma.  Pretty good press for you guys! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyfishar>FlyFishAR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 600<br> <font color=#000000>(10/7/03 2:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.flyfishingarkansas.com/Photo%20Gallery/tn_j.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: First time on the White</span><hr size=1> Richard:<br>
<br>
There are plenty of cheap hotels this time of year. It really depends on where you choose to fish. There is some good public access at Cotter and it has tons of fish. Gassville and Cotter have several hotels there in town. Both the Bull Shoals and Norfork State Parks have good water and good access. the town of Bull Shoals has several hotels as well. I think Gastons even has a hotel that is fairly reasonable. Their access is pretty good too. Off the top of my head I think their hotel is around $80 which might sound like alot. When you consider that you have immdeiate access to some of the best water on the river and it's within walking distance it's not too bad. <br>
<br>
Some of the guys got together a couple of weekends ago and they stayed at &quot;His Place&quot; in Cotter. The water had good access and they caught tons of fish. You can go through that thread and pick up some good information.<br>
<br>
Since you are just begining I'd probably recommend streamers and dry flies. If you're mymphing you could be knitting knots all day. Wooly buggers in olive, black, and white have been working. Olive is the old favorite on this water though. We have been having a good hatch of crane flies and caddis lately. Try out some sparsely tied size #14 dry flies in various colors. Be sure to make a drag free drift.<br>
<br>
If you enjoy your trip try to make the commitment to hiring a guide or taking some lessons in the future. You can learn more in one day with a guide than you could learn in years of trying to do it on your own. <br>
<br>
Enjoy your trip and keep us posted on how everything went. I think you'll have a blast. I've been seeing some HUGE fish on the river this year. Some of the biggest fish I've seen caught have been by total beginners.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Evergreen resort, Bull Shoals Country Inn, Pine Lodge are three places to stay in Bull Shoals in the $50 and less range.  Twin lakes in in Lakeview, Rivercliff Cabins on the way to gastons.   Gastons does not mind if you fish their mileand a half river frontage.  There is a public ramp at gastons just make sure you park up top.  This will give you access to cane island all the way down to the bottom of partee or about 2.5 miles of river.  The state park is easy access.  Wildcat shoals has access and if you can find it there is access through woods right to the top of the shoals.  Perhaps someone can give you better directions on this one.  <br>
<br>
John is right about Buggers.  Olive in particular.  I had some luck with beginers on sunday using black..<br>
Let us know how your trip goes when you get back and welcome to the sport.<br>

I have only fished the White and Norfork once (last October), but vowed to make it an annual trip.  I will second John's comments about getting a guide if you can swing it.  I will also comment that I have not used any of the guides on this board yet (there are several) and have only taken two guided fly fishing trips (one on the Norfork in AR and one on the McKenzie River in OR) and am not connected with any of them.  I also have been fly fishing for about 2 years prior to hitting the AR tailwaters and hooked up with a local guide (I don't think he frequents this board -- otherwise I would mention his name) and we fished the Norfork.  It was a great trip.  I had been successful fly fishing in Missouri for the few years, but I learned more about fly fishing and correcting things that I was doing wrong with line control on the water (very very big thing to watch) and a little more on how to read water, as well as some decent places to fish on these waters.  We are going down this October (10-23 to 10-26), and I do not think we are getting a guide this time around (unless they are running water -- then I will need to scramble to find a guide for one day or I can talk one of my buddies into splitting the cost of a trip one of the days) as we plan to fish the Norfork.  But the first time I visit the White River we will get a guide so that we can learn how to be more successful on that river in future trips.  It might seem like alot of cash -- but if you split the cost with a fishing buddy you can normally hook up with a guide for about $200 a person.  For me, it was money well spent as I learned alot on the water that day.  Good luck on your trip.<br>

I have a pretty good assortment of wooly buggers (especially olive) already but looks like I need to pick up some caddis.  Is there a preferred way to work the woolys?<br>
<br>
I'd love to go with a guide my first time out but since I've laid out a pretty fair sum of coin already (fly rod, 2 reels, line/leaders/tippets, flys, waders, etc.), I'm out of favors with my wife <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   My expectations for this trip are low.  My goal is just to get there, scope out some spots to fish and just work on my casting and presentation.  If I catch anything it'll just be icing on the cake.  I have a buddy that has fly fished in the past and wants to take it back up again.  He was gonna come with me this trip but had to cancel due to work issues.  I'm so excited about going that I just decided to go ahead and go by myself.<br>
<br>
I have a new Temple Fork 9' 5 weight and a SA System 2 reel.  I have another cheapy real (Okuma) that I use on the lakes around here and practicing in the front yard.  <br>
<br>
I'll check back with you guys and hopefully you can let me know if anything changes on the river between now and Saturday (releases, hatches, good/bad fishing spots etc.)<br>

I believe you made a post last year on your trip to the Nor~Fork on the FAOL and your guide was Tom Rogers.   Please correct me if I am at fault.  Tom is a Great Guide and I have learned much from him in the past.  <br>
<br>
Richard,<br>
 Keep an eye on generation (link available on flyfisharkansas.com main page) as they have run some water the last two days.  The projected generation schedule was accurate yesterday and so far sort of accurate today.  Its is only an indicator and should not be trusted 100% but CAN be an indicator that they might generate some.   <br>

  I'll be in Cotter this weekend and if you want someone to go with I always like having company. My ph# in Cotter is 435-2733, I'll get there Thursday evening and be staying thru the week. You can call late Friday or early Sat. I usually stay up late and get up early.<br>
 I've been very fortunate myself with people helping me get started. Call and we'll go.<br>

You are right.  I did post my trip on FAOL, and I did use Tom Rogers.  Tom is a great guy and I did learn ALOT from him.  I still talk with him / Becky quite a bit.  I just didn't want to take away from anyone else that posts on this board (You, John, Andrew, Stinnitti, and all of the others that guide that I forgot), as there is a wealth of knowledge here.<br>

<br>
Richard....I have been on this forum for just a little while now. I think you're going to find that this is some of the greatest guys you may ever meet/e-mail with. The knowledge and experience here is only topped by the sincerity and the willingness of the guys/gals that pass it on. Keep checking back on the board. We threw a get together in Cotter the last weekend of September with some of the guys that are part of this forum and Fly Anglers Online. We had a ball and caught a ton of fish. Jimmy T won't steer you wrong and you can take what John says as gospel. I think he is one of the rare folks who might (notice I said might) get just as much if not more satisfaction from sharing and teaching as he does being on the water fishing. We are planning another trip in March of 04 around Sow Bug Roundup time. I know the feeling of low expectation. My trip to the White was the first I had fished in about 4 years. But, the first hooked fish, the morale boosts from John and Jimmy and all doubts were gone. I hope you get a chance to hook up with Quin. Even if the fishing doesn't turn out the way you wanted, you'll still be a step ahead. When you get a chance to meet and fish with a new friend, the day can't be all bad. Welcome to the board and good luck on your trip. Let us know how things went. No reason we'd have to wait til March either. Maybe a weekend jaunt can be arranged with some of the others in here, too.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
