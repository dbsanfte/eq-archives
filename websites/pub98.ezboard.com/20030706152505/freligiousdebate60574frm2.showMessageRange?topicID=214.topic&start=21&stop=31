<br>
I think you are perhaps skewing the dictionary-definition of &quot;god&quot;, or using the word &quot;god&quot; from a different context that does not pertain to this kind of discussion (i.e. a religious one).  Yes, one can refer to money or energy--even Elvis--as god (I even had a crush in high school whom I referred to as &quot;God&quot;), but used in that context it does not pertain to a discussion or debate about the existence of a supernatural, omniscient, &quot;incorporeal devine&quot; being.  That's like using ovaries to talk about omelettes--yes, they both have to do with &quot;eggs&quot; but they're not the same thing.  To confuse worship of a deity with an unhealthy obsession or pathology (would make an interesting topic on its own) but does nothing to further the argument that there is or may be god.<br>

There is no supernatural component to money.  There is no attribution to money of the creation of the universe.  Applying your logic, there is no such thing as a true atheist, because to be a true atheist you would have to disbelieve in purely natural things that some person somewhere has decided to worship.  This is a poorly framed argument at best.  You are equating it to absurdity.  Atheists do not believe in supernatural gods.  We are not claiming money doesn't exist or that some people focus on it excessively.  An idol being worshiped is merely the physical representation of a supernatural being for the purposes of directing and focusing worship.  Not a material thing itself.  I submit that your friend who worships money, in actuallity worships the power that money brings and if he mistakenly attributes supernatural force (money will make me beautiful, money makes the planet rotate) then it is NOT the god he thinks it is.  It is only small bits of paper and metal with no individual power at all.  The crux of the distinction being that the first 3 ARE gods, and the last three are LIKE gods, and thus get called that and consequently appear in the dictionary under that heading.<br>
<br>
I have yet to meet an atheist who claims &quot;Yeah well that Yahweh does NOT exist, so I am an atheist, but that Allah guy though I don't know about.&quot;  That is an absurdity.  People who worship a god that exludes other gods, xians for example, then become part of your set of pseudo atheists because they don't believe in mithra or vishnu.  That isn't a pseudo atheist, that is a NONatheist.  Heh, and you say MY view of atheism is skewed. LOL!<br>
<br>
The argumentation of being an atheist is that we do not believe in supernatural gods.  To disprove this, someone has to roll out a god.  This necessitates us specifically evaluating the god rolled out and disproving it to remain an atheist.  Much simpler and cleaner than you would represent.  So, as I said, if you roll something out and call it a god and it exists, then that thing is not a god.  Call money a god if you like, there is nothing supernatural about it, it is not a god.  You may treat it like a god, but treating it as something and being that thing are two different things.  I treat my daughter like a princess, but she has no claim to any thrones.<br>

Sorry, I made a mistake while typing out my definition of pseudo atheist.  It was meant to say someone who claims to disbelieve in all manifestations of god(claims to be an atheist) while leaving out some forms of the deities from their scope.  For example, someone who claims that god cannot exist because omnipotence is impossible.  Outside of the judeo-christian family of religions, there aren't many omnipotent gods.(I haven't researched all of them, but then again, I haven't found any omnipotent gods from non-judeo-christian religions.)<br>

There are religions that do not have supernatural gods, they have natural gods.  They also don't credit the creation of the universe to the gods.  For example, the wiccan coven that I visited does not believe that their gods can do everything.  They believe in nature as god, and nature by definition is natural.  When asked about the creation of the universe, almost all of them replied, &quot;I don't know how the universe came into being.  Personally, I don't need to know.  It's here, that's what matters most.&quot;  Now correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't wicca recognized as a religion?  Some of the larger organizations do get the tax exempt status that other religious institutions get.  This would suggest that, at very least, the government recognizes wicca as a religion.  Christian organizations recognize it as a rival religion, so this would suggest that the religious community also recognizes it as a religion.<br>
<br>
Funny that this religion is almost always missed when atheists try to reinforce their disbelief in god(s).<br>

Yes, some Wiccans have formed an organized &quot;church&quot; with all that it entails, but not because it particularly suits their belief system--sadly, it was the only way for military pagans to be able to practise their beliefs while serving.  I think Wicca is not so much overlooked in discussions by atheists as it is understood that it, like other pagan paths, has no firmly established dogma as pertains to the worhip (or belief in the existence) of gods or goddesses.  There are pagans who believe in these entities; there are others, like myself, who see them as representative of what is natural in our world.  The rols of gods and goddesses for many (dare I say most?) Wiccans is too flimsy for the atheist to argue against.  <br>

It looks like you are confusing philosophy with theism.  Wiccans can &quot;believe in nature as god&quot; but 'like a god', 'as a god', 'similar to a god' does not make it A God (i.e. a supernatural entity.)  Even members of the Asatru, a viking based pagan theological society, do not actually think a chariot races thru the storm clouds pulled by giant regenerating goats and carrying a bearded warrior smiting giants with his unbreakable, unliftable mallet of justice.  Yet they still worship Thor.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, athiests do not share common traits aside from disbelief in gods that can be labeled as a philosophy.  You can be an atheist wiccan, and atheist humanist, an atheist naturalist, an atheist lunatic, anything.  There are even atheist xians.  Atheism is a property, not a philosophy.  You can disbelieve in gods because the evidence does not support it, or you can disbelieve in gods because your dog told you there weren't any.  Both are equally atheist.<br>
<br>
Lastly, your fun with numbers prank.  Yes I read your post, I even quoted from it directly where you said the set was infinitely large, then assigned a non-zero probability that any one of them may be god. This can only yeild one result, one of them must be god.  Any infinite set with a non-zero probability will always yeild such a result.  This inevitably follows from generalized, oversimplified or poorly chosen variable values.  Why not try my probability?  Zero.  Then with an infinite set, you still get the same result as a finite set.  Zero.  There is no god.  Pascal's wager and others like it are philosophically immature and a waste of time.  You can dress it up with calculus, but it is still the same bet, and still loses.  Why not roll out a god for us to measure.  If you can, you may just convert us. <p>DBC67<br>

From my experiences, the problem is that most people cannot fathom a non-authoritarian religion.  It's also that when thinking of religion, people aren't used to the idea that there isn't necesarily one path that is right for everybody, but path that is right for each individual.  Even your average atheist is of the opinion that their path is the right one and that everyone that is not on their path is merely being self-deceptive.  Other than that, what is so different about wicca as a religion?  We have groups of like minded believers who gather at regular intervals to worship the deitites.(also known as covens)  We have generally one or two people who lead the group during these meetings.(High priestess and/or high priest)  We have religious holidays, and a rule of conduct,&quot;An it harm none, do what thou will.&quot;  Or are you trying to say that those two major differences listed above are enough to differentiate wicca from most forms of religion?  If you are trying to say that, I'd have to agree.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Although wiccan organizations have been active in the legal matters pretaining to the rights of it's followers, it would not be fair to say that this was the original reason for forming these organizations.  Some of them formed because they knew that the public interest would be focused on them for awhile after having been established, and that is a good way to increase awareness of the path without trying to force their beliefs upon others.<br>
<br>
Your post brings up a question that I was wanting to ask.  Please let me know if it would be better to place this in a new thread.<br>
Pretty much all of us are aware that the two extremes to religious faiths are the following.  <br>
1)Fanatic theists who believe that their belief is the only right way, and anything that violates the supreme sanctity of the word of god will be punished severely, whether it be burning in hell for all eternity, being stoned to death by a practitioner of the faith, or something completely different.<br>
2)Fanatic atheists who believe that anyone who believes that anyone who believes in deities are merely in a state of self-denial, and should wake up and see the world for what it really is.  They generally will not hesitate to call people idiots/stupid/ignorant when those people stand up for their religious beliefs.<br>
Now most people are not fanatical, but they still like to remain near these two extrtemes.  My question is whether or not there is a happy medium.  A place where theists and atheists can see eye to eye without carrying all the stereotypical bias of their particular beliefs.<br>
<br>
DL, <br>
Sorry I didn't see your post till now.  I'm glad that you think I'm on the right path.  Wait, no that's not true.  It's my path and as far as my path is concerned, the only opinion that matters to me is my own.  I would like to point out to you that my progression is not the same as yours as I can say with almost absolute certainty that I will not be trying atheism again.  Been there, done that, moved on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 291<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/20/03 3:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=214.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What do you call an atheist?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2) Fanatic atheists who believe that anyone who believes that anyone who believes in deities are merely in a state of self-denial, and should wake up and see the world for what it really is.

I disagree with your assessment that everyone falls to an extreme.  I would say the bulk of the bell-curve is just like that, in the middle, like a bell curve (sorry, standard gaussian distribution for you math purists.)  The one thing I have noticed in conversation with theists is that they really HAVEN’T examined their theology very closely.  Typically, they are whatever their parents were, or some derivative close to, or in the odd case whatever their spouse is if they weren’t too concerned.  Once in a while there is the reactionary who went far afield from their parents, but consistently they seldom hold a critical examination of their faith.  They just like how it “feels.”  Contrary to my appearance here, I am not a bristling rabid atheist IRL.  I actually do the books for a church and they are constantly asking my business advice and inviting my family to their events and count us as members of their congregation (even to the point of harassing me to join the choir) despite our being clear that we are atheists.  I have many friends of diverse beliefs and we are mutually respectful.  As here I do not back down in the face of challenge, but unlike here I am more sensitive to the fragility of some peoples theology and will stop (if they do) and not try and shred their system.  Among my closest friends are a buddhist, a satanist, a baptist and several atheists.<br>
<br>
No, I see the extremes as just that, extreme.  Not many there at all.<br>

Just because a god is not omnipotent doesn’t mean he/she is not supernatural. If the deity in question defies the laws of physics or natural laws, then isn’t s/he supernatural by definition???(example—providing psychic guidance, invisible beings not limited by space and time…) I am very good friends with a few different types of pagans (yes, there ARE many types of pagans too, not all of which involve covens) and none of them believes a typical xian-type creation myth, nor do they buy the patriarch in the sky type god, but all believe in supernatural beings of some sort and often practice rituals to “tap into energies”, “communicate with spirit guides” or “draw down the moon”.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't wicca recognized as a religion? Some of the larger organizations do get the tax exempt status that other religious institutions get. This would suggest that, at very least, the government recognizes wicca as a religion. Christian organizations recognize it as a rival religion, so this would suggest that the religious community also recognizes it as a religion.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You weren’t addressing me, but firstly I don’t give a flying turd what xians recognize and the gov’t gives the same tax exempt status to other “religions” like Satanism, Buddhism and UUA that are either inclusive of or largely secular/philosophical systems as opposed to those involving the supernatural.<br>

Not by me. In fact I make the effort to use a lower case g and plural when discussing this issue, especially with xians who DO make the assumption that theism=monotheism and that atheists are just anti-xian. Rest assured I find Wicca just as implausible and irrational as xianity and your gods just as false and mythical, and I am not unusual. <br>
<br>
Interesting that YOU posted this though-<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Pretty much all of us are aware that the two extremes to religious faiths are the following. <br>
1)Fanatic theists who believe that their belief is the only right way, and anything that violates the supreme sanctity of the word of god will be punished severely, whether it be burning in hell for all eternity, being stoned to death by a practitioner of the faith, or something completely different.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now Phoenix if it is so important to you that the word theist not be limited to xians then why the use of all xian themes here (hell, stoning)? It certainly seems like you are using the word theist synonymously with xian (leaving pagans out) or was this intentionally done to imply only non-pagans are &quot;fanatic theists&quot;?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2)Fanatic atheists who believe that anyone who believes that anyone who believes in deities are merely in a state of self-denial, and should wake up and see the world for what it really is.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A place where theists and atheists can see eye to eye without carrying all the stereotypical bias of their particular beliefs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well a good first step would be to stop lumping all pagans together (pagan is a term as broad as heathen, atheist etc. and implies NO specific, pre-set dogma), not use the word fanatic when you probably mean fundamentalist and stop accusing large groups of people of name-calling without any evidence. Might also help to not say we are all either extremists or tending toward an extreme position. I, for one, am tired of being defined by the fringe and this type of talk just encourages that. <br>
<br>
I believe common ground is possible only among parties that desire it and can be tolerant and respectful of other belief systems. For many theists this is very possible. For those practicing more intolerant dogmatic version of theism, namely xianity, it is much, much more difficult.<br>

What happened? You tried atheism and got burned? So you've &quot;advanced&quot; from atheism to agnostic/quasi-wiccan deism? I'm curious, what are you getting out of your new improved belief system?<br>

<br>
Second, and this is to ST and DBC, I did not say that everyone was at the extreme.  I specifically said that people were not at the extremes.  I was implying that the shape would be more like a double bell curve.  Kinda like what you see in courses where half the class copied homework assignments from the other half.  Half the class gets Cs because they bomb the exams(cause they only copied and didn't understand) while the other half got As(cause they understood the material).  Relatively no A+ or F marks.  Relatively no fanatics. <br>
<br>
Now that that is said.<br>
<br>
ST, if the deity in question is the embodyment of nature, then isn't that deity by definition natural?<br>
<br>
DBC, atheistic Christian???  LOL.  Christians are deifned by their belief that Jesus Christ was the son of god.  Thus they believe that god exists, for god would have to exist to have a son.  Now how do you actually propose that someone who believes in god also disbelieves in god?<br>
<br>
Finally, DL.<br>
While I was an atheist, my sole goal in life was to gather knowledge.  The more and more time passed, the more I withdrew into myself, and the more I learned.  The only problem was that I was seeking knowledge, not wisdom.  Then I became interested in wicca.  I learnt about it in my search for knowledge, and immediately began to appreciate some of its teachings.(At least relative to some of the other religious teachings that I had been exposed to.)  Soon after, while discussing it with a friend, she told me that she was a wiccan.  Through her, I met with a couple covens to see what specific beliefs they possessed, and in the end I was asked to join one of the covens.  I enjoyed the time I spent with the coven, and I agreed with their beliefs, so I accepted their invitation.  We have official meetings about 5 times a month, plus on the sabbats.  We also get together on a regular basis for a 'night out on the town'.  That's what I get from my belief system.  I get the social interaction that I would not normally get due to my personality type.  I get a group of friends that are closer to me than my family.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doublelatte>Double Latte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Got Milk?</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/20/03 8:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=214.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What do you call an atheist?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We have official meetings about 5 times a month, plus on the sabbats.

Thanks for explaining, Phoenix. I guess I don't feel I'm missing out on that aspect of religion since I am very close to my family (immediate and extended) and have some very good lifelong friends and plenty of social neighbors. Mostly I groove on my husband. He's a Catholic, but we can still stay up into the wee hours of the night debating the meaning of life.<br>

I don't think of knowledge and wisdom as being mutually exclusive. I see them as complimentary. Anyway, enjoy your journey.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
