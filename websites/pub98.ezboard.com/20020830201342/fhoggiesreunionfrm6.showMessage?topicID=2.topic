Her cats, Puddy and Tat, were no longer alive, but with her was one of their children, one she had named Exilia, because she had always been exiled by the other cats. Her blue eyes looked about the place, that was, basically, deserted.<br><br>&quot;Mocha, please,&quot; she said softly to the waitress. When it was delivered, she sipped it thoughtfully, wondering what the reunion would be like. Honestly, the main thing she was wondering was: would she see Jaik? If she did, what would he think of her, now a successful defence lawyer for the Ministry of Magic. In fact, this was actually the first time she had worn her hair out of a bun for almost a year.<br><br>Although she wasn't married, she had had almost no &quot;me-time.&quot; Her house by the sea was rather pretty, but she only had enough time to sleep in it. Quite honestly, for the longest time she had overworked herself. Smiling to herself, she thought about the things she was going to do. For one thing, she was going to spend a lot of time in here, just sitting thee enjoying herself.<br><br>She shivered, drawing her clozk about her tightly, really quite an elegant one, just like the rest of her style. It was midnight blue, and had pretty little roses swirling over it, intertwined together by vines. Her pants were velvet, but they were just plain black, and her shirt was just a pretty white little thing. To be honest, she looked more the part of an artist than of a lawyer, but a lawyer she was, and she was happy being such. Finishing her mocha, she walked out, just wandering about the street. <p><p align=center><font color="powderblue"><b>'The night is serene, sir, and so am I.'<br>~Jane, from <i>Jane Eyre</i></b></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCC0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/uwilhelmkruger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wilhelm Kruger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sharin's boyfriend<br>Such a sweetheart<br>She loves him SOOOO MUCH!!!</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#000000>(8/15/02 2:38:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sipping Some Coffee</span><hr size=1> A figure had been watching her from the corner. Starlight blue eyes following the cup in her hands. The figure was covered in a dark grey uniform. A red eagle emblemed on the right shoulder. At his side lay a sheath with a silver saber. More for decoration then combat. Wilhelm took two steps toward her. Gliding as he did.  His sandy blond hair hung down over his eyes. He took a seat at the table next to her. It had been a while. Perhaps she had forgotten. Wilhelm had fought a war and lost. Worked to tear down a wall and failed. Wilhelm viewed his entire life as failure. Wilhelm looked at a bright blue right on his hand. It was a gift from berlin, a ring for valor on his field. Yet he sat alone. Those he had fought with had passed on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFF0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/usharinmarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sharin Marr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>All-Mighty Creator of the Board!<br>Bow Down to her<br>She loves Wilhelm!<br>Not-so-secretly HATES Dark CHocolate!<br>Thinks it looks like dog crap<br>GO WHITES!!!<br>Is a beautiful and wonderful administrator<br>Would never take away the admin powers of a certain chocolate leader<br>Is much to nice and wonderful to do that<br>Right???</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#000000>(8/15/02 2:56:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/brunettes/fhbl101.gif height=116 width=102></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sipping Some Coffee</span><hr size=1> Anna turned around, hearing a noice. She knew this café was barely populated, only by such bookworms as herself, so it was quite a surprise to hear someone else there. The face was familiar, yet utterly strange.<br><br>Sharin looked at the files she had with her in her briefcase, then at him, and then, a name popped into her head. &quot;Wilhelm Kruger,&quot; she whispered. Smiling, she went over to his booth and plopped into it, for no reason other than to talk. &quot;Wilhelm! Wonderful to see you again!&quot; she said, smiling.<br><br>The expression in her eyes changed from one of curiosity to one of happiness. &quot;It is marvellous to see you again. How have you been? Moreover, how are you?&quot; She smiled as she ordered another mocha to drink. How fond she was of those!<br><br>&quot;Want anything to eat? I can pay for it, I have the money. After all, with all those Death Eaters being captured, I really gain quite a lot.&quot;<br><br>She looked at his eyes, his almost haunted blue eyes. He had changed, had matured. &quot;Wilhelm, what's wrong?&quot; Anna asked, putting her warm hand on top of his. <p><p align=center><font color="powderblue"><b>'The night is serene, sir, and so am I.'<br>~Jane, from <i>Jane Eyre</i></b></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCC0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/uwilhelmkruger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wilhelm Kruger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sharin's boyfriend<br>Such a sweetheart<br>She loves him SOOOO MUCH!!!</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#000000>(8/15/02 3:03:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sipping Some Coffee</span><hr size=1> Wilhelm pulled his hand away. Wilhelm looked up at her. Haunting eyes that seemed to not see her to see something else. He could see them still in his dreams. People dying in the streets. He could hear the echos at night of the people he could not reach the wall over with. Wilhlem lips barely moved, &quot;Times have changed . I have changed. I have lived my life and burried those I loved.  Betrayed those I befriended. Killed those I loved. I am nothing but a monster anymore. I cannot even feel the warmth of a fire&quot;. He sighed looking out at her breifcase. Wilhelm looked at his fist cold and torn. &quot;You fought the death eaters, I fought the world sharin&quot;.

Unlike you, I have hardly lived at all. Once I became a lawyer, I spoke to no one, made friends with no one, or anything. I have changed too, you could say. I changed from the pretty, popular cheerleader into the serious, solitary lawyer. The last part of my description, though, I would like to change. How I wish I could! But because I am so solitary, I can't speak to anyone except those I know, judges, or those that I am helping.&quot;<br><br>Anna felt guilty when he said she fought the Death Eaters. Wincing, she admitted, &quot;And I didn't fight the Death Eaters, I'm afraid I was their defence lawyer, the one who stood up for them.

And also, it was their time to die. Everyone has a time to live, and a time to die. You know that, Wilhelm. It was their time to die. If you hadn't have killed them, someone else would have.<br><br>&quot;I don't give my trust out as easily as you think, Wilhelm,&quot; Anna began earnestly, ignoring the fact that Exilia was digging her claws into her lap. &quot;On my clients, I actually just use a spell so that they think I trust them. With every person, Wilhelm, I only start out with an inkling of trust, and let them build or take away. With patients, I keep the spell until I'm sure I can trust them. With people, I just keep my old opinion until it is built or taken. Wilhelm, you have done nothing to build of the opinion I had of you back in school days. But neither have you done anything to take away from it.&quot;<br><br>One of her slight, slender hand petted the cat Exilia's black fur gently as the other hand scratched under her white chin. Playfully, she saw Wilhelm's hand and pounced pon it. Anna inwardly smiled, knowing that the cat's claws were soft as a feather and as thus could not hurt her friend. <p><b>Okay.

Have you ever seen a man's face when he's dying. Screaming for his last breath.  I even killed my own men anna. There was a tank shot. They were in so much pain. They just wanted it to end. So I ended it. I killed even children anna. The french resitance went as young as 10 years old. I found out later what our country had done to the jews. Six million people slaughtered anna, while we were told of relocation camps. Was it there time?  I wish it had been...&quot;  Wilhelm did not finish it with &quot;my time&quot;. She could guess for he knew she was smart. <br><br>Wilhelm sighed at the cat. A look of warmth. Just wanting to hold something , somehow. Just to feel warmth again. Yet wilhelm's hand came back and rested on his side. Wilhelm's eyes held bags now. From nights filled with the screams of victims of war. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/pastel/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.threadControl?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/pastel/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="hoggiesreunionfrm13">The Sea<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm3">The Pot de Moutarde Hotel<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm4">Aprés L'école Diner<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm5">Hoggies Reunion Masquerade Ball<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm12">Diner avec Fleur<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm6">Livre Café<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm10">THE CHOCOLATE WARS!!!<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm14">Sharin Marr's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm16">Kerri McField's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm18">Jena Skye's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm17">Aldalfel Remedus's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm15">Jonathan Desmond's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm19">Tara Hallow's Office<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm1">General OOC<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm2">Poll Room<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm8">Subbies!<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm9">Rules<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm11">Classified Information<option value="hoggiesreunionfrm20">The Dungeons</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bhoggiesreunion>Hoggies Reunion</a><font color=#000000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fhoggiesreunionfrm6>Livre Café</a> <font color=#000000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
