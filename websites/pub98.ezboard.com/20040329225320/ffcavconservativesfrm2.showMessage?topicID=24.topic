The only one I lost was on the subject on WMD in Iraq.  I stated that they found those shells to have Mustard Gass in them, now the USA says they did not.  <br>

I have a question, what do you all think about teledemocracy?  Big debate in my Political Science class.  I for one am against it!

Liberal profs are everywhere.  Read some of David Horowitz books; he chronicles how leftists specifically targeted schools (even elementary schools, see Teaching As A Subversive Activity - a book for commies, by commies).  The began with private religious schools, because the first way to undermine our system is through spreading secularism/atheism/anything other than Christianity.  They targeted, Presbyterian, Episcopal Methodist and Catholic schools.  Through hiring committees, these schools served as a network to hide, enrich and champion commies especially during McCarthyism.  Before then, most commies hid out in organized labor and the CPUSA - see the Wobblies for instance<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah, I'm a college student!  Liberalism thrives in the ivory tower, because it doesn't have to be tested.  It can remain a theory, and even fail, but still be taught semester after semester as fact, with no consequence.  I've been to Lees McRae College, which was 90% hard left, and at least 75% radical gay  (their library had not one book by a conservative, but the entire collections of Herbert Marcuse and Abbie Hoffman).  BTW, read Hoffman to learn how to wage a humorous and member attracting propaganda war for the College Republicans or other conservative group.  He made a life-long study of propaganda and comedy; it is the ultimate irony to use his work against his cause!  I also went to University of Georgia, where the cultural battle was more intense, but there were tons of conservative students.  There is strength in numbers.  At Liberty University, liberalism is just a small student cult.  I'll be in the UNC system soon, which should be fun!<br>
<br>
I always debate profs, and always win (fact beats emotion, history beats theory) - however, be careful.  They will (in my experience) punish you grade-wise.  They grade us on our ability to repeat what they have taught, no matter how flawed.  Even if you maintain a solid GPA, they can sabotage your efforts to get into grad school, and even bring you up on charges of violating diversity codes.  I know of several horror stories, but the worst was a black guy from Africa, who took on a Black Studies prof.  This kid saw his entire village hacked to death or sold into slavery.  He survived, came here by his own merits, learned proper English, got scholarships and worked his way through college - even got an internship at the UN.  When the prof told the class how victimized blacks are, and how they need this and that program, affirmative action and slavery reparations, he took him on.  He destroyed the prof and exposed him as the anti-American, lazy parasite he was!!  The prof brought him up on charges of creating a hostile environment, he got kicked out of school, lost his student visa, returned to a civil war in Africa, never to be heard from again!!!!!<br>
<br>
Hang in there, and be sure to form a network of politically allied friends to watch your back.  Have several witnesses to every debate, who will testify you aren't a nazi.  Try to hang with these friends on campus, because the more outspoken you get, the more threats you will receive.  <br>
<br>
Check out my columns, especially &quot;Nazi Greens&quot;, Google for it - you should enjoy it. Feel free to contact me any time, and keep me updated on your battles (conservativejud@yahoo.com)  and, I'm starting a college speaking tour soon; let me know if a club on your campus would like to invite me.<br>
