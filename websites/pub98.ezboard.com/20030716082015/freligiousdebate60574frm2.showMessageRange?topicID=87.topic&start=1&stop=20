Some have already taken exception to me calling him out as a charlatan, liar and fraud. I continue to assert he was all these things and that each claim can be backed up with evidence. This is not mere name calling, it is fact. He lied, he deceived and fabricated physical “proof” and tablets to get his religion off the ground. <br>
<br>
Joseph Smith and other LDS Church leaders practiced polygamy prior to May 1845, yet spoke out that they did not. Doing something then saying you aren’t doing it is lying. <br>
<br>
Joseph Smith made several prophecies that NEVER came true. Now he could have been mentally ill, but considering his bizarre affinity for divining rods and “magic stones” (I believe this creeps into LDS theology in the form of “seer stones”, I tend to think he knew what he was doing the same way snake oil salesmen knew they weren’t peddling antiobiotics.<br>
<br>
Joseph Smith claims to have translated ancient languages he did not speak and that were later totally debunked. My 15 month old also makes up “secret” languages noone else has every heard or spoken….this does not make him a prophet. Should he claim it is proof he is talking to god I will take him straight to a pshychologist, not have people worship him.<br>
<br>
I can provide loads of examples and here are a few I grabbed real quickly but I am sure there are many others DBC and my fellow educated skeptics can contribute. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>“Times and Seasons, vol. 6, pg. 894 (May 1, 1845)<br>
&quot;As to the charge of polygamy, I will quote from the Book of Doctrine and Convenants, which is the subsrcibed faith of the church and is strictly enforced. Article of Marriage, sec. 91, par. 4, says, &quot;Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should have but one wife except in the case of death when either is at liberty to marry again.&quot; Sec. 12, par. 7. &quot;Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart and shall cleave unto her and NONE ELSE.&quot; In ancient till God cleanses the earth, and restores the government of his says, &quot;know this that, in (the last days of perilous times shall come), for men shall be TRAITORS, FALSE ACCUSSERS, INCONTINENT, fierce despiser of those that are good.&quot; No wonder then that apostates rage, or that the fulness of truth revealed again should bring a storm of persecution.&quot; <br>
I now ask you who is the &quot;TRAITOR, FALSE ACCUSSERS, INCONTINENT, fierce despiser of those that are good&quot;? Joseph Smith and the LDS Church leaders were the ones that clearly deceived its members and the public. This is now historical fact. <br>
After performing this exhaustive search I am certainly convinced that many of the early Mormons knew nothing about polygamy. The LDS Church leaders not only lied about their practice of polygamy, they denied the charges brought against them, falsely accussing those that raised the charges against them. Polygamy was both against Illinois State law and also againts the Doctrine and Covenants. Some Mormons have justified this act of lieing and deceiving because God must have commanded it. <br>
The God I know is not a God of deception and not a God of lies. I can only hope that my Mormon friends and family can see this and the other deceptions passed on by Mormon leaders. <br>
<br>
The following prophecies made by Joseph Smith have not been fulfilled in over 150 years. They are given in approximate chronological order, except for the many Missouri prophecies, which are grouped together. <br>
PEACE AND KNOWLEDGE: Sept 21, 1823. Joseph Smith says in the Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith 2:40, that Moroni told him that Isaiah 11 was &quot;about to be fulfilled.&quot; Isaiah 11:6-11 prophesies that the wolf and the lamb, the calf and the lion, etc. shall dwell in peace together, and that nothing will &quot;hurt or destroy,&quot; and that the earth shall be &quot;full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: None of this has yet come to pass. <br>
SALE OF BOOK OF MORMON COPYRIGHT: Winter 1829-1830. Comp Hist 1:165 Joseph had a revelation that Hiram Page and Oliver Cowdery were to go to Toronto to sell the copyright of the Book of Mormon to raise money. <br>
FULFILLMENT: They went, according to the revelation, but were completely unsuccessful. Joseph Smith &quot;inquired of God&quot; and was told that some &quot;revelations&quot; are not from God. David Whitmer reports this incident in his book An Address To All Believers In Christ, Richmond, 1887, photo reprinting by Utah Lighthouse Ministry, pp 30-31. (See the comment above on the test of a true prophecy.) <br>
PRAYERS ANSWERED: September 1830. D&amp;C 29:6. Jesus promises the Saints that &quot;Whatsoever ye shall ask in faith... ye shall receive.&quot; (see also D&amp;C 132:40) Joseph Smith believed firmly in this promise (see Chron JS Mar 10, 1844) <br>
FULFILLMENT: The prayers of the faithful Mormons, especially during the periods of conflict in Kirtland, Missouri, and Nauvoo undoubtedly included many requests for divine aid, victory over their enemies, and peace in their lands. Surely they asked for these things. But instead they were driven out and found no peace. This prophecy is probably failing thousands of times a day, as faithful Mormons pray. (This prophecy is just a repetition of Jesus' promise at Matt 21:22, Mark 11:24, John 14:13-14, 15:7, 16:23, and 1 John 3:22.) <br>
SAINTS GATHERED IN ONE PLACE: September 1830. D&amp;C 29:8 God has decreed that the elect shall be gathered into one place &quot;against the day when tribulation and desolation are sent forth upon the wicked.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The &quot;one place&quot; continued to change as the Mormons were driven from one temporary refuge to the next. After arriving in Utah, the Mormons viewed that as the gathering place. But the modern church apparently no longer believes in this gathering, since it encourages new converts to remain in their homelands. Tribulation and desolation have not been sent forth upon the wicked. <br>
WICKED WILL BURN, ALL PROPHECIES FULFILLED: September 1830. D&amp;C 29:9-11. &quot;For the hour is nigh and the day soon at hand&quot; when the wicked will burn, all prophecies will be fulfilled, and Jesus will return for a thousand years. <br>
FULFILLMENT: This is another prophecy such as Ezekiel 12:27-28 referred to: if the hour were nigh and the day soon at hand, this surely would have been fulfilled within 160 years. By no means have all prophecies been fulfilled, and many cannot now be fulfilled. <br>
ALL NATIONS SHALL BOW: March 1831. D&amp;C 49:9-10. The nations of the earth shall bow to the Mormon gospel or they &quot;shall come down&quot; and &quot;shall be laid low of power.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: None of the nations of the earth have accepted the Mormon gospel or &quot;bowed&quot; to it, yet none have been &quot;laid low&quot; because of it. <br>
MISSOURI PROPHECIES<br>
Joseph Smith made a number of prophecies regarding Missouri as the location of Zion and the gathering place and refuge for the saints. Since they all have the same general meaning and none of them have been fulfilled, they are dealt with together here. <br>
March 7, 1831. D&amp;C 45:64-74. Saints are to gather riches and purchase an inheritance to be called New Jerusalem, also called Zion, a place of refuge and safety, where the wicked will not come, and against which the wicked will refuse to battle. The righteous will come from all nations and sing songs of everlasting joy. The wicked will fear and stand afar off and tremble, and &quot;all nations shall be afraid.&quot; <br>
July 1831. D&amp;C 57:1-3 Missouri is named as the land consecrated for the gathering of the Saints and the place for the City of Zion and the building of a temple at Independence. It will be purchased by the saints &quot;for an ever-lasting inheritance.&quot; <br>
August 13, 1831. D&amp;C 62:1, 6. The faithful will be preserved and rejoice in Missouri. &quot;I, the Lord, promise the faithful and cannot lie.&quot; <br>
Sept 22-23, 1832. D&amp;C 84:2-5, 31 Zion will be built with its temple at Independence, &quot;in this generation&quot;. This generation shall not all pass away until the temple will be built upon the spot. Orson Pratt in 1870 reiterated the prophecy (JD 9:71, 10:344, 13:362) and insisted that it will come to pass within the generation living in 1832. <br>
Jan 4, 1833. HC 1:315-316. Joseph Smith says &quot;by the authority of Jesus Christ&quot; that &quot;not many years shall pass away&quot; before the wicked &quot;of this generation&quot; will be swept from off the face of the land and the Lost Ten Tribes will be gathered to Missouri, and that &quot;there are those now living upon the earth whose eyes shall not be closed in death until they see all these things, which I have spoken, fulfilled.&quot; <br>
Aug 2, 1833. D&amp;C 97:18-20. Promise that if the saints are obedient the City of Zion (in Missouri) will prosper and become glorious, great and terrible, honored by the nations of the earth. Zion cannot fall or be moved out of its place. <br>
FULFILLMENT: Mormons were driven out of Independence and from all of their settlements in Missouri in 1839. The temple lot is not owned by the Mormon church. No one living in the generation when the prophecy was made is still alive. The wicked of that generation were no more &quot;swept from off the face of the land&quot; than were their contemporary Mormons. The Lost Ten Tribes have not been gathered to Missouri. Nothing in all these prophecies has been fulfilled, even though the majority of the saints steadfastly followed Joseph Smith and were faithful. <br>
Oct 12, 1833. D&amp;C 100:13-15 Zion (Missouri) will be chastened &quot;for a little season&quot; but then &quot;redeemed.&quot; <br>
Dec 10, 1833. HC 1:455. Joseph Smith tells the saints that they should retain their lands in Missouri and seek legal redress against their enemies. If they should not obtain it, God will avenge them with &quot;ten thousand of his Saints&quot; and all their adversaries would be destroyed. <br>
FULFILLMENT: The Mormons lost all their lands in Missouri; they did seek legal redress but were unsuccessful; their enemies were not destroyed; their wrongs were not avenged; the Mormons were driven out of Missouri. <br>
Dec 16, 1833. D&amp;C 101:17-20 Zion (Missouri) shall not be moved out of its place; the Saints will receive their inheritance there, and there is no other place than Missouri appointed by God for the gathering of the Saints. <br>
Feb 24, 1834. D&amp;C 103:5-7 If the Saints will hearken to the counsel of the Lord, &quot;they shall, for I have decreed it, begin to prevail against mine enemies from this very hour... and... they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms of the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto the saints, to possess it forever and ever.&quot; Verse 15: &quot;The redemption of Zion must needs come by power;&quot; and God will raise up a man like Moses, namely Joseph Smith, who will enable them to &quot;possess the goodly land&quot; (v. 20). Joseph Smith is to organize Zion's Camp (a Mormon army) and relieve the distress of the Saints in Missouri. Verse 36: &quot;All victory and glory is brought to pass unto you through your diligence, faithfulness and prayers of faith.&quot; <br>
Spring 1834. Joseph Smith prophesies to the members of Zion's Camp that &quot;within three years they should march to Jackson County and there should not be a dog to open his mouth against them.&quot; Reed Peck Manuscript p. 3 [cited in Tanner, The Mormon Kingdom 1:4] <br>
FULFILLMENT: Zion's Camp was organized but utterly failed and it disbanded in July. Cholera decimated them and the campaign did not restore the saints to their homes. They did not return as Zion's Camp. The Mormons continued to encounter fierce opposition. The Mormons never prevailed against their enemies. (Milton R. Hunter, The Gospel through the Ages, p. 282, &quot;Reed Peck Manuscript&quot; p. 3; HC 3<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> xxix [cited in Tanner, The Mormon Kingdom 1:4]. <br>
June 22, 1834. D&amp;C 105:13-15. The Lord says regarding Missouri: &quot;I will fight your battles... the destroyer I have sent forth to destroy and lay waste mine enemies; and not many years hence they shall not be left to pollute mine heritage, and to blaspheme my name upon the lands which I have consecrated for the gathering together of my saints.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The Missouri opponents of the Mormons were not destroyed, but have remained in Missouri (and &quot;polluted&quot; it?) The Mormons were driven out of Missouri within five years. <br>
Aug 16, 1834. HC 2:145. Joseph Smith says that the Spirit of the Lord tells him that the Saints should be ready to move into Jackson County, Missouri, on September 11, 1836, &quot;which is the appointed time for the redemption of Zion.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: If Zion was redeemed in 1836, it was unredeemed in 1839, when the Mormons abandoned Missouri. <br>
FAR WEST TEMPLE: April 26, 1838. D&amp;C 115. Revelation concerning the city of Far West, Missouri, and the building of a temple there. God commands the temple to be built; the church will be gathered to Zion (Missouri), which will be &quot;for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm.&quot; Work on the temple is to commence in the summer of 1838, with construction to begin April 26, 1839, with work to continue &quot;diligently until it shall be finished, from the corner stone thereof unto the top thereof, until there shall not anything remain that is not finished.&quot; (v. 12) Verse 17: &quot;I say unto you, it is my will that the city of Far West should be built up speedily by the gathering of my saints.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The temple cornerstone was laid, but no more work was ever done and the temple is still not completed. Far West was abandoned by the Mormons soon after this revelation. It would appear that the building of the Far West temple was not the work of God, since God's work cannot be frustrated (see D&amp;C 3:3). <br>
LIBERTY JAIL PROPHECIES: March 20, 1839. D&amp;C 121. This is &quot;Prayer and Prophecies&quot; from Joseph Smith while he was a prisoner in the jail at Liberty, Missouri. It contains several prophecies: <br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp he will be avenged of his enemies by the sword (v. 5) (this is phrased as a prayer, but God had promised Joseph Smith that his prayers would be answered; he need only ask. D&amp;C 29:6) <br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp his friends will not charge him with transgressions (v. 10) <br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the hopes of those who do charge him with transgression shall have their hope blasted (v. 11) <br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp God will &quot;change the times and seasons&quot; (v. 12) <br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Joseph Smith's enemies will be taken &quot;in their own craftiness&quot; (v. 12) <br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;not many years hence, ... [his enemies] and their posterity shall be swept from under heaven, saith God, that not one of them is left to stand by the wall.&quot; (v. 15) <br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp knowledge will be poured down from heaven upon the heads of the Mormons. <br>
FULFILLMENT: None of these prophecies came to pass. Joseph Smith's enemies were not destroyed &quot;by the sword;&quot; rather, the Mormons were successfully driven out of Missouri. His friends did charge him with transgressions within a few years, and those charges (in The Nauvoo Expositor) resulted directly in his arrest and destruction, as his enemies wished. God did not &quot;change the times and seasons,&quot; whatever that may mean. In general, the enemies of the Mormons achieved their goal of driving the Mormons out and destroying Joseph Smith. Their posterity was not destroyed, but survived. At least, there is no record of the anti-Mormon Missourians being swept away. And what knowledge has been &quot;poured down from heaven&quot; upon the Mormons since 1839? <br>
(One might wonder why Smith spent so long in prison; according to the Book of Mormon , Mormon 8:24, faith can make prison walls tumble.) <br>
End of the Missouri prophecies <br>
 <br>
ICE SHALL FLOW: Nov 3, 1831. D&amp;C 133:26. Those &quot;who are in the north countries... shall smite the rocks, and the ice shall flow down at their presence.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The church has made no claim that this prophecy has been fulfilled. Besides, what does it mean? <br>
CHRIST'S SECOND COMING IS IMMINENT: Joseph Smith prophesied on several occasions that the Second Coming was to be expected very soon. <br>
Nov 3, 1831. D&amp;C 133:17. &quot;The hour of [Christ's Second] coming is nigh.&quot; <br>
Nov 13, 1833. &quot;...a sure sign that the coming of Christ is clost [close] at hand.&quot; <br>
April 23, 1834. D&amp;C 104:59. &quot;...to prepare my people for the time when I shall dwell with them, which is nigh at hand.&quot; <br>
Nov 25, 1834. D&amp;C 106:4. &quot;The coming of the Lord draweth nigh...&quot; <br>
Apr 3, 1836, D&amp;C 110:16. &quot;The great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors.&quot; <br>
Feb 14, 1835. HC 2:182. Joseph Smith preached that the coming of the Lord would be in 56 years (i.e., about 1891). This prophecy also occurs in his diary for April 6, 1843 and HC 5:336. See also D&amp;C 130:14-17. Joseph Smith prophesies that &quot;there of those of the rising generation who shall not taste death till Christ comes.&quot; He prophesies &quot;in the name of the Lord God - let it be written: that the Son of Man will not come in the heavens till I am 85 years old, 48 years hence or about 1890.&quot; (The official historians have deleted the last phrase, beginning with &quot;48 years&quot; from the church history, but it is contained in the original diary.) The version in D&amp;C 130 is phrased negatively, i.e., Christ will not come before 1890. It is also made conditional on Joseph Smith living to the age of 85. Joseph Smith says (v 16) that it might merely mean that if he lives to 85 he will go where Christ is, and therefore see his face. But that interpretation would not make sense if the revelation is in response to Joseph Smith's inquiry about the time of the second coming (v 14). <br>
FULFILLMENT: The second coming did not occur about 1891, and the Church does not claim that it did. Nor has it occurred since. Joseph Smith did not live to be 85 years old. God must have known that he would not. Why would God make a revelation conditional upon an event which he knew would never happen? <br>
NATIONS SHALL TREMBLE: Nov 3, 1831. D&amp;C 133:42 &quot;...all nations shall tremble at thy presence.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: No one can claim that all nations tremble at the presence of the Mormons. <br>
ENEMIES WILL BE SHAMED: Dec 1, 1831. D&amp;C 71:7-10 Mormons are to call upon their enemies to meet them both in public and in private, and the shame of their enemies shall be made manifest. &quot;No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The Mormons are generally reluctant to discuss their religion with anyone but prospective converts, but, when they have been willing to meet with their critics and debate, they have not been particularly able to make their opponents' shame manifest. The Missourians and the residents of Hancock County, Illinois, who &quot;formed weapons&quot; against the Mormons, were successful in driving them out. <br>
NEW YORK WILL BE DESTROYED: Sept 22-23, 1832. D&amp;C 84:114-115. New York, Albany and Boston will be destroyed if they reject the gospel. The &quot;hour of their judgment is nigh...&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: Newell K. Whitney and Joseph Smith went to New York, Albany, and Boston and preached there. These cities did not accept the gospel. They have not been destroyed. <br>
THE END OF ALL NATIONS: Dec 25, 1832. D&amp;C 87. Prophecy of the rebellion of South Carolina, war between the states. The South will call on Great Britain for aid, and as a result war will be poured out upon all nations; slaves will revolt; the inhabitants of the earth shall mourn; famine, plague, earthquake, thunder, lightning, and a full end of all nations will result. <br>
FULFILLMENT: This prophecy is the one most often cited by Mormons to prove Joseph Smith's prophetic power. However, most Mormons are unaware of the political situation in America at the time it was made. In November 1832 South Carolina had declared its power to &quot;nullify&quot; any federal act, and President Jackson was prepared to go to war to enforce federal authority. Most people expected war. Thus the &quot;prophecy&quot; did no more than reflect commonly held opinion. Even when the South did finally revolt, in 1861, although Great Britain came to its assistance, other elements of the prophecy were not fulfilled: slaves did not rise up, war was not poured out upon all nations, there was no world- wide famine, plague, earthquake, etc., and there was no resulting &quot;end of all nations.&quot; Morris, PJS, contends that World War I, the associated famines, the 1918 influenza epidemic, fulfill this prophecy. But these are not as a result of the American Civil War. (see Chron JS, Dec 1832) Not even Morris claims that there were earthquakes because of it. <br>
STARS WILL FALL: Dec 27, 1832. D&amp;C 88:87. Earth shall tremble and reel, the sun shall not give light, the moon shall be bathed in blood, the stars shall &quot;become exceedingly angry&quot; and fall, all &quot;not many days hence.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: More than 59,000 days have now passed, and this prophecy has not been fulfilled. It is doubtful that in any sense the stars will ever fall. (This is a paraphrase of Isa 13:10, as re-paraphrased by Matt 24:29 and Mark 13:25.)<br>
DESTROYING ANGEL WILL PASS BY: Feb 27, 1833. D&amp;C 89. The &quot;Word of Wisdom&quot; promises that those who obey it (i.e., by abstaining from hot or strong drinks and from tobacco) shall &quot;receive health in their navel...; find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge...; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And... the destroying angel shall pass by them... and not slay them.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: Most Mormons observe the &quot;Word of Wisdom&quot; faithfully. Although Mormons have been shown statistically to have fewer health problems than the average American, they still seem to be subject to being slain by the destroying angel. Nor do they seem to have greater wisdom and knowledge than others because of their avoidance of coffee, alcohol and tobacco. <br>
THE UNITED ORDER - EVERLASTING: Apr 23, 1834. D&amp;C 104. Revelation establishing a separate United Order in Missouri, to be &quot;everlasting&quot; (v 1), &quot;immutable and unchangeable&quot; (v 2), to benefit the church &quot;until I come&quot; (v 1). &quot;This is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints...&quot; (v 16). <br>
FULFILLMENT: The United Order (holding all property in common) failed, even though the saints tried valiantly to make it work. It was attempted in Ohio, Missouri and Utah. Nowhere did it survive. It was not everlasting. It was not immutable or unchangeable, since it was tried with numerous variations. It has not provided for the saints. It has not lasted until the Lord has come. <br>
MORMON DEBTS WILL BE PAID: April 23, 1834. D&amp;C 104: 78-83. God's promise to deliver the Saints from their debts. &quot;It is my will that you shall pay all your debts.&quot; The Lord will soften the hearts of their creditors. <br>
FULFILLMENT: Joseph Smith and other prominent Mormons had to flee Kirtland to avoid their creditors, leaving debts of thousands of dollars unpaid. Smith ultimately filed bankruptcy. <br>
ORSON HYDE'S PREPARATION OF JEWS' RETURN: Feb 14, 1835. Joseph Smith prophesied that Orson Hyde would go to Jerusalem, and &quot;by thy hands shall the Most High do a great work, which shall prepare the way and greatly facilitate the gathering of that people.&quot; [Morris, PJS p 261] <br>
FULFILLMENT: Orson Hyde did go to Jerusalem, but did not do anything to greatly facilitate the gathering of the Jews, which did not occur until over 100 years later. <br>
APOSTLES IN FOREIGN LANDS AND HEAVEN: Jan 21, 1836. HC 2:380-381. Joseph Smith had vision of the future (thus, by implication, a prophecy) in which he saw &quot;the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, who are now upon the earth... in foreign lands, standing together in a circle, much fatigued, with their clothes tattered and feet swollen...&quot; He saw &quot;Elder M'Lellin in the south, standing upon a hill, surrounded by a vast multitude, preaching to them [and performing a miraculous healing].&quot; He also saw Brigham Young &quot;standing in a strange land, in the far south and west, in a desert place... preaching to them in their own tongue..&quot; He also &quot;saw the Twelve in the celestial kingdom of God.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The Quorum of Twelve as constituted at the time of this revelation never was together in a foreign land as described. William E. M'Lellin never preached in the South, and was excommunicated May 11, 1838, just over two years after the prophecy. Brigham Young never preached to the inhabitants of any &quot;strange land&quot; in their own tongue. If Mormon doctrine is correct, five of the apostles seen by Joseph Smith &quot;in the celestial kingdom&quot; should never be there, because they apostatized or were excommunicated: Lyman Johnson, Luke S. Johnson, William E. M'Lellin, John F. Boynton, and William Smith. <br>
SALEM, MASS., WILL BELONG TO MORMONS: Aug 6, 1836. D&amp;C 111. Joseph Smith received a revelation telling him to go to Salem, Massachusetts. This section is the revelation given to him when he and his companions had arrived there. It promises that they would receive the city and &quot;have power over it&quot; and &quot;its wealth pertaining to gold and silver&quot; should be theirs. <br>
FULFILLMENT: Joseph Smith returned in September to Kirtland. Neither he nor the Mormons ever had power over the city, nor did they receive its gold and silver. <br>
KIRTLAND'S MORMON BANK WILL PROSPER: Jan 1837. LDS Mess &amp; Adv. 3:443 Joseph Smith says it is &quot;wisdom and according to the mind of the Holy Spirit&quot; that the saints should invest in the Kirtland Safety Society. Wilford Woodruff's journal Jan 6, 1837, records that Joseph Smith declared &quot;that he [Joseph Smith] had received that morning the word of the Lord upon the subject of the Kirtland Safety Society,&quot; and that &quot;if we would give heed to the commandments the Lord had given this morning all would be well.&quot; [cited in Tanner, MSR 531] John F. Boynton, apostle, said that he understood that the bank was established because it was the will of God (HC 2:509-510) Joseph Smith prophesied that like Aaron's rod the bank would swallow up other banks &quot;and grow and flourish ... and survive when all others should be laid in ruins.&quot; Zion's Watchman March 24, 1838 [cited in Brodie p 195] <br>
FULFILLMENT: The Kirtland Safety Society Bank, renamed the Anti- Banking Company, was organized Nov 2, 1836. It failed to receive a charter from the state, and Joseph Smith and S. Rigdon were convicted and fined $1000 for illegal banking. The bank failed miserably. Those who had invested in it lost their investment. (Comp Hist 1:401-402) <br>
KIRTLAND LAND INVESTORS WILL BE RICH: April 1837. LDS Mess &amp; Adv Apr 1837 p 488 [cited in Brodie 202] &quot;This place [Kirtland, Ohio] must be built up, and will be built up, and every brother that will take hold and help secure and discharge these [land] contracts shall be rich.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: Nobody became rich investing in Kirtland land contracts. Most of those involved in the Kirtland land speculation, encouraged by Joseph Smith, lost money. Joseph Smith himself went bankrupt and had to flee his creditors. <br>
PROPHECY ABOUT THOMAS MARSH: July 23, 1837. D&amp;C 112. Revelation to Thomas B. Marsh, then the president of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles, prophesying that he would be &quot;exalted,&quot; that he would preach to Jews and Gentiles &quot;unto the ends of the earth,&quot; &quot;among the mountains, and among many nations.&quot; Marsh is told that &quot;by thy word many high ones shall be brought low, and .. many low ones shall be exalted.&quot; In verse 11 Marsh is told that &quot;I [God] know thy heart.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: Less than two years later, on March 17, 1839, Marsh was excommunicated. God apparently did not know his heart. Marsh never preached the Mormon gospel as was prophesied, but was a bitter enemy of the church for many years. He later repented and rejoined the church, but this prophecy was never fulfilled. <br>
PROPHECY ABOUT DAVID W. PATTEN: April 17, 1838. D&amp;C 114:1. Revelation concerning David W. Patten, an apostle, directing him to settle his business up so that he could go on a mission &quot;next spring...to testify of my name and bear glad tidings unto all the world.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: Less than eight months later Patten was dead, killed leading Mormons in the Battle of Crooked River on October 25, 1838. He never went on the mission as prophesied. It cannot be that his lack of faith frustrated the revelation, since Joseph Smith said of him that he &quot;died as he had lived, a man of God, and strong in the faith.&quot; HC 3:171. <br>
PROPHECY ABOUT OLIVER GRANGER: July 8, 1838. D&amp;C 117:12-15. Revelation and prophecy regarding Oliver Granger: &quot;his name shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord... let the blessings of my people be on him forever and ever.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: No Mormon knows anything about Oliver Granger beyond this mention in the D&amp;C. As far as the Mormon people are concerned, Oliver Granger has been forgotten, rather than &quot;had in sacred remembrance ... forever and ever.&quot; <br>
JOSEPH SMITH WILL BE SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON JOSEPH: April 22, 1839 and Aug 27, 1834. Joseph Smith says that he will be succeeded by his oldest son, Joseph Smith III. [Quinn pp 630, 638] <br>
FULFILLMENT: Joseph Smith III left the main body of Mormons when they went to Utah under Brigham Young. Thus, according to the Utah church, he did not become his father's successor in the Utah church. He became president of the Reorganized Church in 1860. <br>
PROPHECY ABOUT GEORGE MILLER: Jan 19, 1841. D&amp;C 124:20-21. Revelation and prophecy regarding George Miller. He &quot;is without guile; he may be trusted...; I, the Lord, love him... Let no man despise my servant George, for he shall honor me.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: On December 3, 1848, George Miller was disfellowshipped by the Mormons. Apparently God was mistaken about Miller. <br>
NAUVOO HOUSE WILL ALWAYS BE SMITH'S: Jan 19, 1841. D&amp;C 124:56, 60. God orders the building of the Nauvoo House, a hotel, in which Joseph Smith and his &quot;house&quot; will have &quot;place&quot; &quot;from generation to generation.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: Nauvoo House was never fully completed. Joseph Smith never lived in it; his widow Emma was living in it at her death, but his family have not owned or occupied it since then. It is owned by the Reorganized Church of LDS. <br>
KIRTLAND WILL BE BUILT UP: Jan 19, 1841. D&amp;C 124:83. God says that he will &quot;build up Kirtland [Ohio]&quot; after he has scourged its [non-Mormon] inhabitants. The implication is that it will be built up for the Saints. <br>
FULFILLMENT: The Mormons never returned to Kirtland, except in very few numbers. The inhabitants never suffered any &quot;scourge.&quot; The Reorganized Church holds title to the temple there. <br>
CITY OF ZARAHEMLA, IOWA: March 1841. D&amp;C 125:1-4. Revelation directing the Mormons to build a city called Zarahemla in Iowa, across the river from Nauvoo. <br>
FULFILLMENT: No such city was ever built. <br>
QUEENS WILL CONTRIBUTE: Apr 28, 1842. Joseph Smith prophesies about the newly-founded Relief Society: &quot;before ten years... the queens of the earth shall come and pay their respects to this Society. They shall come with their millions and shall contribute of their abundance for the relief of the poor.&quot; [Quinn p. 634] <br>
FULFILLMENT: By 1852 no queens of the earth had done anything resembling what Joseph Smith prophesied, nor have they done so since. <br>
POWER TO DETECT FALSITY: April 28, 1842. Joseph Smith gives the sisters of the Relief Society &quot;and the Elders&quot; the keys of the kingdom &quot;that they may be able to detect everything false.&quot; [Quinn p. 634] <br>
FULFILLMENT: Apparently by the 1980s the Elders no longer had these keys, since they were unable to detect the forgeries foisted on them by Mark Hofmann, but rather esteemed him an authority on rare Mormon documents, paying him thousands of dollars for his forgeries. The church leaders learned of his deception from the secular authorities, when he was arrested for murders he had committed in furthering his schemes against the church. See any of several excellent accounts of this affair, e.g. Naifeh and Smith, The Mormon Murders, New York, 1988. <br>
PROPHECY ABOUT ANSON CALL: Aug 6, 1842. Anson Call Diary [cited in Morris PJS]. Joseph Smith prophesies that Anson Call will &quot;go and assist in building cities from one end of the country to the other and ... shall perform as great a work as has ever been done by man, and the nations of the earth shall be astonished...&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: Anson Call assisted in building Fillmore, Utah (population in 1970: 1411). He did not assist in building cities from one end of the country to the other. He did not perform any work &quot;as great ... as has ever been done by man,&quot; or at which the nations of the earth were astonished. <br>
JOSEPH SMITH WILL TRIUMPH: September 1, 1842. D&amp;C 127:2. Joseph Smith prophesies that he &quot;shall triumph over all my enemies.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: His enemies murdered him less than two years after this prophecy. <br>
JOSEPH SMITH IN PALESTINE: January 20, 1843. Joseph Smith prophesies to Orson Hyde that the two of them will drink wine together in Palestine. (JS MS Diary) <br>
FULFILLMENT: Joseph Smith never was in Palestine. (His drinking wine would have been a violation of the Word of Wisdom) <br>
US GOVERNMENT WILL BE DESTROYED: May 18, 1843. HC 5:394, also Mill Star 22:455. Joseph Smith prophesies &quot;by virtue of the holy priesthood... and in the name of the Lord&quot; that if Congress or the United States will not redress the wrongs which the Mormons suffered in Missouri, and grant them protection, &quot;the government will be utterly overthrown and wasted,&quot; they shall be &quot;broken up as a government&quot; and there will be nothing left of them. (A similar prophecy was made Dec 16, 1843. See Quinn p 641, Chron JS 189) <br>
FULFILLMENT: The United States rejected the Mormons' petitions; their wrongs were not redressed; they were not protected from their enemies. The United States government was never overthrown and is still in existence. <br>
JOSEPH SMITH WILL BE MADE RULER AND STRENGTHENED: July 12, 1843. D&amp;C 132:53. &quot;I give unto my servant Joseph that he shall be made ruler over many things;... and from henceforth I will strengthen him.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: At the time of this prophecy Joseph Smith was at the height of his power. He was never a ruler over any more than at that time. In less than one year he was dead, not strengthened. <br>
MORE WILL BE REVEALED ABOUT PLURAL MARRIAGE: July 12, 1843. Revelation and prophecies regarding plural marriage. D&amp;C 132.66 says that &quot;pertaining to this law [the law of plural marriage] I will reveal more unto you, hereafter.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The church has not said that it has received any subsequent revelation on this subject except to say that plural marriage will not be practiced by the church. <br>
PLURAL MARRIAGE WILL ALWAYS BE PRACTICED: D&amp;C 132 was interpreted by Brigham Young [see Tanners, MSR p 228] to mean that the principle of plural marriage, once it had been made known, had to be lived and practiced by anyone to whom it had been made known, or that person would be damned, and only by living in plural marriage could one receive the highest exaltation. Verse 3-4: &quot;all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same. For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned, for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory.&quot; See also verses 6, 21, 33. The principle of plural marriage is referred to as a &quot;new and everlasting covenant.&quot; John Taylor, third president and prophet, interpreted this to mean that the church could never give up the principle of plural marriage. <br>
FULFILLMENT: Plural marriage was practiced by the Mormons secretly until 1852 (and the church lied during that time, vehemently denying any such doctrine or practice), then openly until 1890, when the church announced to the world that it had stopped performing plural marriages (although they continued to be performed secretly by high church authorities for about another 15 years). Any Mormon who now enters into a plural marriage is likely to be excommunicated by the church, even if the Mormon lives in a jurisdiction where polygamy is not illegal. The attempt by God to institute plural marriage among the Mormons was frustrated and abandoned by them. <br>
MORMONS WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO COOK: Feb 6, 1844. Joseph Smith prophesies that within five years the Mormons would be able to live without cooking their food. (Joseph Smith manuscript diary, omitted from the HC. Cited in Quinn, p. 642). <br>
FULFILLMENT: The Mormons are still cooking their food. <br>
DAVID SMITH WILL BE PRESIDENT AND KING: April 1844. Joseph Smith prophesies that his unborn child will be called David, and will be &quot;president and king of Israel.&quot; (cited in Quinn p 644) <br>
FULFILLMENT: The child was called David. However, he was never &quot;president and king of Israel.&quot; He died in 1904, at the age of 60, having spent the last 27 years of his life in an insane asylum. He was a member of the Reorganized Church. His highest position in that church was counsellor to the president, but he never actually served as such. <br>
MORMONS WILL TRIUMPH OVER ENEMIES: June 19, 1844. Mormon Neighbor. Joseph Smith warns others not to interfere in Mormon affairs, &quot;for as sure as there is a God in Israel, we shall ride triumphant over all oppression.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: Within 10 days of this prophetic warning, Joseph Smith was killed by the mob, and within three years the Mormons had abandoned Nauvoo. <br>
PROPHECY ABOUT W. W. PHELPS: Date unknown. Prophecy made to W. W. Phelps, cited in Stenhouse, Rocky Mountain Saints, p. 42, that Phelps would not taste of death till Jesus came. <br>
FULFILLMENT: W. W. Phelps died March 7, 1872, apparently before Jesus came. <br>
 <br>
PROPHECIES OF JOSEPH SMITH WHICH WERE FULFILLED (?)<br>
MOVE TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS: Aug 6, 1842. HC, George Q. Cannon Diary, Anson Call Diary (which gives the date as 1843), cited in Morris, PJS. Prophecy that the Mormons would continue to suffer affliction and would finally move to the Rocky Mountains and become a mighty people. <br>
FULFILLMENT: Joseph Smith sent scouts West in 1843 to look for a place to settle, and again on Feb 21, 1844 he instructed the Twelve to explore the West. He was considering Oregon, California, and Texas, as well as the Great Basin, as the next Zion. [Quinn p 635] The Mormons did move to the Rocky Mountains and became the most powerful segment of society in Utah, as well as an influential force in several other Western states, a position which they have maintained and continue to strengthen. <br>
However, the Call diary was not actually written until years later, from memory, and the manuscript of the HC dates only from 1845 (after JS's death), where the words of this prophecy appear only as an interlinear insertion which could only have been made after the Mormons actually arrived in Utah. Thus it appears that this &quot;prophecy&quot; is a forgery. See MPM 85-86. <br>
PROPHECY ABOUT STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS: May 18, 1843. HC 5:393-4,398, Chron JS, PJS. Joseph Smith prophesies to Stephen A. Douglas that he will &quot;aspire&quot; to the presidency of the U.S., and that if he ever turns against the Mormons, he will &quot;feel the weight of the hand of Almighty God upon [him]&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: Douglas did aspire to the presidency, but did not get it. Mormons claim that it was because he did turn against them. However, this prophecy, like the previous one, appears to be a forgery by the editors of HC. It supposedly is recorded in Wm. Clayton's diary. The manuscript of that diary, however, has no prophecy about Douglas. See MPM 86-88. <br>
MORMONS WILL ESCAPE THEIR ENEMIES: Feb 25, 1844. HC 6:225, Chron JS. Joseph Smith prophesies that within five years the Mormons would be out of the power of their old enemies. <br>
FULFILLMENT: By 1849 the Mormons had set up their theocracy in Utah and, for a time at least, were no longer plagued by their enemies. (By 1857, however, the U.S. was sending an army to Utah to put down the &quot;Mormon Rebellion.&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
JACKSON COUNTY WILL BE DEVASTATED: ca. 1839. Unrecorded prophecy, reported in Morris, PJS p 180. Joseph Smith advised General Doniphan not to own property in Jackson County, Missouri, because &quot;God's wrath hangs over Jackson county. God's people have been ruthlessly driven from it, and you will live to see the day when it will be visited by fire and sword. The Lord of Hosts will sweep it with the besom of destruction. The fields and farms and houses will be destroyed, and only the chimneys will be left to mark the desolation.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: In 1863 Union troops were ordered to burn all houses and crops in Jackson County because of the anti-Union guerrilla warfare of the residents. It was considered one of the worst atrocities of the war. <br>
PORTER ROCKWELL WILL DIE IN BED: Joseph Smith promised his body guard Porter Rockwell that if he never cut his hair, he would die in bed. <br>
FULFILLMENT: Rockwell complied, and in spite of a violent life, died peacefully. (Harold Schindler, Orrin Porter Rockwell, Salt Lake City 1966, pp 108-109) <br>
A VAIN PROPHET WILL BE THROWN DOWN: This prophecy by Joseph Smith, although it was fulfilled quickly and literally, is rarely cited by Mormons. July 1828. D&amp;C 3:4. &quot;For although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur the vengeance of a just God upon him.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: On May 26, 1844, Joseph Smith made the following statement in a public sermon (Brodie p 374, HC 6:408-412): <br>
&quot;Come on, ye persecutors! ye false swearers! All hell, boil over! Ye burning mountains, roll down your lava! For I will come out on the top at last. I have more to boast of than ever any man had. I am the only man that has ever been able to keep a whole church together since the days of Adam. A large majority of the whole have stood by me. Neither Paul, John, Peter, nor Jesus ever did it. I boast that no man ever did such a work as I. The followers of Jesus ran away from Him; but the Latter-day Saints never ran away from me yet.&quot; <br>
At this time he was secretly married polygamously to over 40 women, some of them wives of men still living. Many who knew of these secret marriages accused him of changing the doctrine of the church to satisfy his own carnal desires, in violation of the Book of Mormon (Jacob 2:23-29, 3:5) and D&amp;C 49:16. <br>
Almost exactly one month after this boast, on June 27, 1844, he was killed by his enemies in a gun battle at Carthage Jail. <br>
CONCLUSION<br>
Summarized above are about sixty prophecies of Joseph Smith which were not fulfilled. Mormons may object that some of them may still be fulfilled, for example, Jesus will yet come, the Far West temple will yet be built, New York will yet be destroyed, Salem will yet belong to the Mormons, etc. Yet many of the prophecies cannot be fulfilled: the dates for their fulfillment were given, and those dates have passed; the people whose deeds were prophesied have died without their performing those deeds. <br>
Morris, PJS, discusses only &quot;fulfilled&quot; prophecies, and only eight of them. In addition to four of those discussed above (he does not mention the prophecy about the downfall of boastful prophets), he is forced to include pronouncements by Joseph Smith that were not prophecies about the future at all, but statements about the past, namely, that mankind began in America, not the Old World; that Jesus was born on April 6; and that the Western Hemisphere is a choice land and will always be free from tyrants (the latter, since it occurs in the Book of Mormon, should not be considered a prophecy of Joseph Smith, since, according to Mormon doctrine, Joseph Smith merely translated of the book, not its author). <br>
Five prophecies fulfilled out of the sixty-five or so found recorded does not even measure up to Hyrum Smith's standard of a &quot;hit one in ten times,&quot; and is far short of the promise (and prophecy) in D&amp;C 1:37 that &quot;ALL&quot; will be fulfilled. Joseph Smith fails to pass the test of a true prophet, even by his own standards or those of his followers (e.g., Morris). <br>
EXAMPLES OF THE DENIAL AND PRACTICE OF POLYGAMY<br>
 <br>
DENIALS:<br>
History of the Church, vol. 2, pg. 247 (August 1835) &quot;The clerk of every church should keep a record of all marriages solemnized in his branch. All legal contracts of marriage made before a person is baptized into this Church should be held sacred and fulfilled. Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in the case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.&quot;(This was included in the first published Doctrine and Covenants and accepted unanimously by the Twelve before being published. This passage in *every* D&amp;C edition until 1876 when D&amp;C 132 was first introduced to the Doctrine and Covenants). <br>

&quot;And now to your question, 'How early did the Prophet Joseph practice polygamy?' I hardly know how wisely to reply, for the truth at times may be better withheld; but as what I am writing is to be published only under strict scrutiny of the wisest, I will say, that the revelation [D&amp;C 132] to the Church at Nauvoo, July 21, 1843, on the Eternity of the Marriage Covenant and the Law of Plural Marriage, was not the first revelation of the law received and practiced by the Prophet. In 1835, at Kirtland, I learned from my sister's husband, Lyman R. Sherman, who was close to the Prophet, and received it from him, &quot;that the ancient order of Plural Marriage was again to be practiced by the Church.&quot; This at the time, did not impress my mind deeply, although there then lived with his family a neighbor's daughter, Fannie Alger, a very nice and comely young woman about my own age, toward whom not only myself, but every one, seemed partial for the amiability of her.&quot;<br>
(Date of marriage to Fannie Alger: prior to 1838, probably 1835 when Fannie Alger lived with Joseph Smith) <br>

&quot;I now come to that part of my story that you will be most likely interested in, which regard the doctrine taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith in regard to the plural marriage system ....... After we got in the house Sister Woodworth took me in another room and told me that Flora was one of Joseph's wives. I was aware or believed that Eliza R. Snow and two of Partridge girls were his wives but was not informed about Flora. But now Sister Woodworth gave me all the information necessary, so I knew Joseph believed and practiced polygamy.&quot;<br>

Brigham Young performed the sealing, and Heber C. Kimball the blessing. I know he had six wives and I have known some of them from childhood up. I knew he had three children. They told me.

&quot;Dear Sir: To condemn unheard, any man or set of men or their principles, on the strength of popular rumor, or the testimony of enemies, would be gross injustice. An impartial investigation should always precede condemnation. The Latter-day Saints are charged by their enemies, with th blackest crimes. Treason, murder, theft, polygamy, and adultery, are among the many crimes laid to their charge. -- The press reiterates and gives publicity to these charges. Under these circumstances, it is but right, that they should be heard in their defence. I shall, therefore, in this communication, briefly examine and refute a few of the charges, for it would need a legion of writers to answer (all) the lies told about us.&quot; <br>

They publish their lies, and straightway they are believed, and hawked about as awful disclosures, and received by community with trembling and holy horror. Sidney Rigdon, I see by the papers, has made an exposition of Mormonism, charging Joseph Smith and the Mormons with polygamy, &amp;c. it dones not require a very sagacious mind to fathom Mr. Rigdon's motive for doing.&quot; “<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Have you read the Book of Mormon?  If nothing else, logic tells me that it would be impossible to &quot;make up&quot; a book in the time that it was translated.  Books on metal plates in stone boxes had not been discovered at that point in history and yet after the book was published this type of archeological find was discovered.<br>

Furthermore, making up a book that was only paraphrasing and garbling the bible back in a text that supported your ideals is not nearly as hard as decyphering 2,000 year old writing of a language long since lost to us, even for one skilled in the art.  When JS was presented an actual hieroglyphic sample, he bolloxed the decryption.  Lastly, many charlatans are killed as a result of their charlatanry.  Any so callous and selfinvolved as depicted above would have no issue in ignoring the lives of their family, especially if they had 26 OTHER wives.

Quotations:<br>
 &quot;There are extensive and impressive evidences for the authenticity of the Book of Mormon as an ancient document dealing with real people and places, contrary to the endlessly and mindlessly repeated mantras of anti-Mormons.&quot; Statement by Jef Lindsay 18 <br>
 &quot;Archeologists and other scholars have long probed the hemisphere's past and the society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated the Book of Mormon.&quot; Statement by the National Geographic Society 6 <br>
 &quot;...faith in the scriptures—whether the Bible or the Book of Mormon—must rest upon something other than scholarly consensus and archaeological evidence... Ultimately, God will reveal what is true in such matters and we must trust him for our answers.&quot; The Newsletter of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1997-OCT <br>
 &quot;It can be stated definitely that there is no connection between the archeology of the New World and the subject matter of the Book of Mormon. There is no correspondence whatever between archeological sites and cultures as revealed by scientific investigations and as recorded in the Book of Mormon, hence the book cannot be regarded as having any historical value from the standpoint of the aboriginal peoples of the New World.&quot; F.H.H. Roberts, Jr, Smithsonian Instituion, 1951 <br>
 &quot;As long as Mormons generally are willing to be fooled by (and pay for) the uninformed, uncritical drivel about archaeology and the scriptures which predominates, the few L.D.S. experts are reluctant even to be identified with the topic.&quot; J.L. Sorenson, Brigham Young University, 1966 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Overview:<br>
The Book of Mormon describes migrations of people from the Middle East to Central America, and further describes some elements of their civilizations. If the Book is accurate, archeologists would expect to find numerous pieces of hard evidence in Central America that confirm the presence of these societies: metal objects; writing in Hebrew and Egyptian, remains of old-world plants, animals from Palestine, etc. Some hard evidence has been found in the past. However, they have all been subsequently shown to be forgeries. To date, no actual evidence to confirm the Book of Mormon has been found, although many LDS believers expect that it will be uncovered in the future. A popular saying in the field of archeology is that no evidence of existence is not evidence of non-existence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Book of Mormon and its archaeology<br>
The Book of Mormon describes three migrations of people from the Middle East to  America. 1 The first occurred circa 2247 BCE, at approximately the time of the Tower of Babel as described in Genesis 11:1-10. 2 At that time, God &quot;confused the language of all the [peoples of the] earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.&quot; [RSV]  &quot;All the earth&quot; would presumably include the Americas. These people, the Jaredites, eventually died out circa 600 BCE with a massive battle at Hill Comorah in what is now upper New York State.<br>
<br>
The second and third migrations occurred circa 600 BCE, between the times of the Assyrian and Babylonian victories over the Israelites. The immigrants:<br>
<br>
 &quot;established huge civilizations that stretched from sea to sea, <br>
 wrote extensively using Hebrew and Egyptian,  <br>
 domesticated horses and cattle,  <br>
 cultivated many Old World plants,  <br>
 traveled in chariots, and  <br>
 smelted many metals, including iron and steel.&quot; 1 <br>
<br>
The Book of Mormon also discusses:<br>
<br>
 Gold and silver coins used by the Nephites. Their monetary system was based on the value of barley.  <br>
 Domesticated species of animals: cattle, oxen, sheep, swine and goats. 5   <br>
 Fighting with bows, arrows, and metal shields.  <br>
 Temples, synagogues and sanctuaries for worship.  <br>
<br>
One group, the Nephites, kept the Law of Moses. The other group, the Lamanites abandoned the beliefs of the Israelites. Because of their unbelief and idolatry, the &quot;Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.&quot; (2 Nephi 5:21). A major battle occurred between the Nephites and Lamanites at the Hill Comorah in 385 CE. <br>
<br>
If the Book of Mormon is true, then there would be certain logical consequences:<br>
<br>
 Studies of the blood types, facial shape, and genetic makeup of modern-day Native Americans would show that they were related closely to the ancient Israelites, and thus to present-day Jews. Some DNA evidence among a minority of Native Americans has been found that shows the likelihood of a migration of individuals from Europe and Asia Minor to America. However, their arrival date in the new world was about 10,000 BCE or earlier. Thus, the migration is unrelated to activities in the Book of Mormon. No evidence has been found for a migration during the time span that the Book discusses. 18 <br>
 Archeologists could go to the remains of ancient Native American towns, excavate down to the levels that were active between 600 BCE and 385 CE, and uncover evidences of Nephite or Lamanite writings, domesticated horses, old world plants, chariots, inscriptions, metal objects, etc. <br>
 Excavating the Hill Comorah should reveal countless artifacts left by the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who died there in two major battles. <br>
 One would expect names from the Book of Mormon to be present in inscriptions left by the Nephites or Lamanites. Thomas Ferguson wrote: &quot;The important thing now is to continue the digging at an accelerated pace in order to find more inscriptions dating to Book-of-Mormon times. Eventually we should find decipherable inscriptions ... referring to some unique person, place or event in the Book of Mormon.&quot; 16    <br>
<br>
Quite a few forgeries have been planted and &quot;discovered.&quot; However, no convincing evidence was ever found that has been accepted by non-Mormon archaeologists.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thomas Stuart Ferguson:<br>
In 1952-OCT, Ferguson, a lawyer, organized the New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF). He was a devout believer in the LDS faith, and thus in the validity of the Book of Mormon. He reasoned that if the validity of the Book could be proven, then countless individuals would flock to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), as the true Christian church. He was convinced that the Book of Mormon was an accurate historical document and that it would be relatively easy to uncover artifacts to prove its validity. The NWAF was initially funded directly by the LDS. As each year passed, the Foundation's scientists were unable to find any evidence that would support the Book of Mormon. The LDS church reorganized the NWAF under Brigham Young University in 1960. As of 1999, it consists only of a director and assistant, active in only one excavation. 14<br>
<br>
In a book review, Duwayne Anderson commented: &quot;In 1993 Michael D. Coe, professor of anthropology at Yale University, summarized the situation by saying: 'I have seen no archaeological evidence before or since that [1973] date which would convince me that it [the Book of Mormon] is anything but a fanciful creation by an unusually gifted individual living in upstate New York in the early nineteenth century.' &quot; <br>
<br>
Ferguson was eventually convinced that the Book of Mormon is a work of fiction, whose contents bear no relationship to the reality of Native American civilization prior to 385 CE. The NWAF &quot;failed to find evidence to prove the Book of Mormon, and the man who organized it...ended up losing his faith in the church.&quot; 17<br>
<br>
<br>

Other observations skeptical of the Book of Mormon:<br>
Genetic and blood testing studies have found that Native Americans are related closely to the inhabitants of Siberia and not to the ancient Israelites. Thomas W. Murphy, 35, is chairperson of the anthropology department at Edmonds Community College in Lynnwood, WA. He wrote a chapter in the anthology &quot;American Apocrypha&quot; in which he uses genetic data to discredit the Book of Mormon's claim that American Natives are heathen descendents of ancient Israelites. The essay is taken from his doctoral dissertation at the University of Washington. He faces a church disciplinary council on 2002-DEC-8 at which he may be excommunicated for his beliefs. 19<br>
<br>
&quot;No unusual artifacts have ever been found at or around Hill Comorah.&quot; 4 No evidence of the remains of domesticated animals have been found prior to the European invasion in the late 15th century. Similarly, there is no evidence of barley or any other old world plants in North America at that time. &quot;...Bows and arrows...were not invented in America until A.D. 1000.&quot; Although there are remains of Natives who made use of meteoric iron and native copper, there are no indications that Natives smelted metals during the time interval covered by the Book of Mormon. There are no indications of the remains of sanctuaries, temples or synagogues. One would not expect to find synagogues, because none are known to have existed in the Middle East until after the Babylonian exile - decades after after the second emigration, as described in the Book of Mormon.<br>
<br>
Some Mormons have promoted some records and inscriptions such as the &quot;Bat Creek Stone, the Kinderhook Plates, the Newark Stones and the Phoenician Ten Commandments.&quot;  All were forgeries. 5 No names of individuals mentioned in the Book of Mormon have every been found in ancient inscriptions. <br>
<br>
The National Geographic Society maintained in 1998 that: &quot;Archeologists and other scholars have long probed the hemisphere's past and the society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated the Book of Mormon.&quot; 6<br>
<br>
The Smithsonian Institution prepared a form letter in 1996. It seems to have been in response to a rumor that the Smithsonian had used the Book of Mormon as an archaeological guide book. Their letter says, in part: <br>
<br>
 &quot;Smithsonian archeologists see no direct connection between the archeology of the New World and the subject matter of the book [of Mormon].&quot;  <br>
 &quot;The physical type of the American Indian is basically Mongoloid, being most closely related to that of the peoples of eastern, central and northeastern Asia.&quot; <br>
 &quot;...none of the principal Old World domesticated food plants or animals (except the dog) occurred in the New World in pre-Columbian times. American Indians had no wheat, barley, oats, millet, rice, cattle, pigs, chickens, horses, donkeys, camels before 1492.&quot;  <br>
 &quot;Reports of findings of ancient Egyptian, Hebrew and other Old World writings in the New World in pre-Columbian contexts have frequently appeared...None of these claims has stood up to examination by reputable scholars.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Material in support of the Book of Mormon<br>
Many devout Mormons reject the findings of skeptics; they believe that the Book of Mormon is an accurate portrayal of life in the New World prior to 385 CE. 9,10,18 Some writers have found indicators of its validity:<br>
<br>
 With his limited education, the Mormon founder Joseph Smith could not have written the Book of Mormon because its extensive use of Hebraic names and expressions would have been beyond his ability to write. <br>
 Some LDS researchers see bodily features among Amerindians that agree closely with inhabitants of Palestine. <br>
 &quot;The Book of Mormon [sic] patterns of seasonal warfare, festival celebrations at certain times of the year, religious gatherings, travels, kingship coronations, political turmoil as well as warfare, the keeping of records, natural calamities&quot; all agree with the archeological record. 11 <br>
 Some examples exist that prove the existence of the horse in North America during the pre-Columbian period. <br>
 Some native languages in ancient times had a word for &quot;metal.&quot; It is reasonable to assume that they actually used metal if they had a word for it. <br>
 &quot;...horned incense burners, models of house types, wheel-made pottery, cement, the true arch, and the use of stone boxes&quot; have been found both in Mesoamerica and the ancient Near East. These might indicate some form of contact between people in the two areas. <br>
 Some LDS researchers believe that:  The city of Nephi, mentioned in the Book of Mormon, might have been the ancient city of Kaminaljuyu -- the location of the modern city of Guatemala City.  <br>
 El Cerro Vigia, a hill in southern Mexico, may be the Hill Comorah. <br>
 <br>
<br>
Some authors comment about the missing data in the archeological record:<br>
<br>
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Just because no artifacts have been found that support the Book of Mormon, that is no proof that future artifacts will not be found which verify the book. <br>
 The term &quot;horse&quot; in the Book might really have referred to a deer that people rode. <br>
 The Book does not say that all the natives in the New World were either Lamanites or Nephites. There may have been many more natives who entered America via the Bearing Strait, and left records in their blood type, facial characteristics and genes -- perhaps swamping the contributions of the Lamanites and Nephites. <br>
<br>
********************************************<br>
<br>
I find it interesting that the rebuttal forwarded here mainly relies on the idea that &quot;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;  Wouldn't it be more prudent to wait for evidence of something before pledging your support for it?<br>

&quot;As to the charge of polygamy, I will quote from the Book of Doctrine and Convenants, which is the subsrcibed faith of the church and is strictly enforced. Article of Marriage, sec. 91, par. 4, says, &quot;Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should have but one wife except in the case of death when either is at liberty to marry again.&quot; Sec. 12, par. 7. &quot;Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart and shall cleave unto her and NONE ELSE.&quot; In ancient till God cleanses the earth, and restores the government of his says, &quot;know this that, in (the last days of perilous times shall come), for men shall be TRAITORS, FALSE ACCUSSERS, INCONTINENT, fierce despiser of those that are good.&quot; No wonder then that apostates rage, or that the fulness of truth revealed again should bring a storm of persecution.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
The 91st section of the D&amp;C verse 4 says &quot;Therefore whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the spirit manifesteth truth.&quot;  It doenst have anything to do with marriage.  The revelation on plural marriage was not published until 1843 section 132 of the D&amp;C, it was given in 1831 and yes, it was not publically taught.  One of the main reasons was one - Joseph Smith did not want to accept it or practice it.  But was commanded that if he did not put it into practice the Lord would remove him from his position(death) - Another reason that it was not made public, was the persecution of the church and members was already so great (murder, rape,pillaging, false accusations in court etc)  And yes there were some who left the church because they could not accept the practice when it was made known.<br>
<br>
In the quote from the times and seasons, you dont indicate who is speaking.<br>
<br>
2nd claim:<br>
SALE OF BOOK OF MORMON COPYRIGHT: Winter 1829-1830. Comp Hist 1:165 Joseph had a revelation that Hiram Page and Oliver Cowdery were to go to Toronto to sell the copyright of the Book of Mormon to raise money. <br>
FULFILLMENT: They went, according to the revelation, but were completely unsuccessful. Joseph Smith &quot;inquired of God&quot; and was told that some &quot;revelations&quot; are not from God. David Whitmer reports this incident in his book An Address To All Believers In Christ, Richmond, 1887, photo reprinting by Utah Lighthouse Ministry, pp 30-31. (See the comment above on the test of a true prophecy.) <br>
***********<br>
This is heresay, written 50 years after the fact.  The BoM was already published in 1830 and the copyright established in the US.<br>
<br>
3rd claim <br>
PRAYERS ANSWERED: September 1830. D&amp;C 29:6. Jesus promises the Saints that &quot;Whatsoever ye shall ask in faith... ye shall receive.&quot; (see also D&amp;C 132:40) Joseph Smith believed firmly in this promise (see Chron JS Mar 10, 1844) <br>
FULFILLMENT: The prayers of the faithful Mormons, especially during the periods of conflict in Kirtland, Missouri, and Nauvoo undoubtedly included many requests for divine aid, victory over their enemies, and peace in their lands. Surely they asked for these things. But instead they were driven out and found no peace. This prophecy is probably failing thousands of times a day, as faithful Mormons pray. (This prophecy is just a repetition of Jesus' promise at Matt 21:22, Mark 11:24, John 14:13-14, 15:7, 16:23, and 1 John 3:22.) <br>
**********<br>
It is presumptious to assume what the people prayed for in the privacy in their own homes.  God did give them aid in that he helped them travel to the SL Valley and find a home here.<br>
<br>
Also part of that scripture is ommitted in &quot;being united in prayer according to my command&quot;<br>
<br>
Claim #4SAINTS GATHERED IN ONE PLACE: September 1830. D&amp;C 29:8 God has decreed that the elect shall be gathered into one place &quot;against the day when tribulation and desolation are sent forth upon the wicked.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The &quot;one place&quot; continued to change as the Mormons were driven from one temporary refuge to the next. After arriving in Utah, the Mormons viewed that as the gathering place. But the modern church apparently no longer believes in this gathering, since it encourages new converts to remain in their homelands. Tribulation and desolation have not been sent forth upon the wicked. <br>
*********<br>
This is semantics.  What the Lord wanted was the saints to be all together.  The second half of that, that we no longer gather is true.  As a church with ongoing revelation, the times change and needs change.  Noah got revelation for his specific time and need. Moses the same thing.  Living revelation means that as needs change so does his will concerning what we do.<br>
<br>
#5<br>
WICKED WILL BURN, ALL PROPHECIES FULFILLED: September 1830. D&amp;C 29:9-11. &quot;For the hour is nigh and the day soon at hand&quot; when the wicked will burn, all prophecies will be fulfilled, and Jesus will return for a thousand years. <br>
FULFILLMENT: This is another prophecy such as Ezekiel 12:27-28 referred to: if the hour were nigh and the day soon at hand, this surely would have been fulfilled within 160 years. By no means have all prophecies been fulfilled, and many cannot now be fulfilled. <br>
ALL NATIONS SHALL BOW: March 1831. D&amp;C 49:9-10. The nations of the earth shall bow to the Mormon gospel or they &quot;shall come down&quot; and &quot;shall be laid low of power.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: None of the nations of the earth have accepted the Mormon gospel or &quot;bowed&quot; to it, yet none have been &quot;laid low&quot; because of it. <br>
*********************<br>
These prophesies deal with the second coming of Christ and as of yet that hasnt happened.<br>

MISSOURI PROPHECIES<br>
Joseph Smith made a number of prophecies regarding Missouri as the location of Zion and the gathering place and refuge for the saints. Since they all have the same general meaning and none of them have been fulfilled, they are dealt with together here. <br>
March 7, 1831. D&amp;C 45:64-74. Saints are to gather riches and purchase an inheritance to be called New Jerusalem, also called Zion, a place of refuge and safety, where the wicked will not come, and against which the wicked will refuse to battle. The righteous will come from all nations and sing songs of everlasting joy. The wicked will fear and stand afar off and tremble, and &quot;all nations shall be afraid.&quot; <br>
July 1831. D&amp;C 57:1-3 Missouri is named as the land consecrated for the gathering of the Saints and the place for the City of Zion and the building of a temple at Independence. It will be purchased by the saints &quot;for an ever-lasting inheritance.&quot; <br>
August 13, 1831. D&amp;C 62:1, 6. The faithful will be preserved and rejoice in Missouri. &quot;I, the Lord, promise the faithful and cannot lie.&quot; <br>
Sept 22-23, 1832. D&amp;C 84:2-5, 31 Zion will be built with its temple at Independence, &quot;in this generation&quot;. This generation shall not all pass away until the temple will be built upon the spot. Orson Pratt in 1870 reiterated the prophecy (JD 9:71, 10:344, 13:362) and insisted that it will come to pass within the generation living in 1832. <br>
Jan 4, 1833. HC 1:315-316. Joseph Smith says &quot;by the authority of Jesus Christ&quot; that &quot;not many years shall pass away&quot; before the wicked &quot;of this generation&quot; will be swept from off the face of the land and the Lost Ten Tribes will be gathered to Missouri, and that &quot;there are those now living upon the earth whose eyes shall not be closed in death until they see all these things, which I have spoken, fulfilled.&quot; <br>
Aug 2, 1833. D&amp;C 97:18-20. Promise that if the saints are obedient the City of Zion (in Missouri) will prosper and become glorious, great and terrible, honored by the nations of the earth. Zion cannot fall or be moved out of its place. <br>
FULFILLMENT: Mormons were driven out of Independence and from all of their settlements in Missouri in 1839. The temple lot is not owned by the Mormon church. No one living in the generation when the prophecy was made is still alive. The wicked of that generation were no more &quot;swept from off the face of the land&quot; than were their contemporary Mormons. The Lost Ten Tribes have not been gathered to Missouri. Nothing in all these prophecies has been fulfilled, even though the majority of the saints steadfastly followed Joseph Smith and were faithful. <br>
Oct 12, 1833. D&amp;C 100:13-15 Zion (Missouri) will be chastened &quot;for a little season&quot; but then &quot;redeemed.&quot; <br>
Dec 10, 1833. HC 1:455. Joseph Smith tells the saints that they should retain their lands in Missouri and seek legal redress against their enemies. If they should not obtain it, God will avenge them with &quot;ten thousand of his Saints&quot; and all their adversaries would be destroyed. <br>
FULFILLMENT: The Mormons lost all their lands in Missouri; they did seek legal redress but were unsuccessful; their enemies were not destroyed; their wrongs were not avenged; the Mormons were driven out of Missouri. <br>
Dec 16, 1833. D&amp;C 101:17-20 Zion (Missouri) shall not be moved out of its place; the Saints will receive their inheritance there, and there is no other place than Missouri appointed by God for the gathering of the Saints. <br>
Feb 24, 1834. D&amp;C 103:5-7 If the Saints will hearken to the counsel of the Lord, &quot;they shall, for I have decreed it, begin to prevail against mine enemies from this very hour... and... they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms of the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto the saints, to possess it forever and ever.&quot; Verse 15: &quot;The redemption of Zion must needs come by power;&quot; and God will raise up a man like Moses, namely Joseph Smith, who will enable them to &quot;possess the goodly land&quot; (v. 20). Joseph Smith is to organize Zion's Camp (a Mormon army) and relieve the distress of the Saints in Missouri. Verse 36: &quot;All victory and glory is brought to pass unto you through your diligence, faithfulness and prayers of faith.&quot; <br>
Spring 1834. Joseph Smith prophesies to the members of Zion's Camp that &quot;within three years they should march to Jackson County and there should not be a dog to open his mouth against them.&quot; Reed Peck Manuscript p. 3 [cited in Tanner, The Mormon Kingdom 1:4] <br>
FULFILLMENT: Zion's Camp was organized but utterly failed and it disbanded in July. Cholera decimated them and the campaign did not restore the saints to their homes. They did not return as Zion's Camp. The Mormons continued to encounter fierce opposition. The Mormons never prevailed against their enemies. (Milton R. Hunter, The Gospel through the Ages, p. 282, &quot;Reed Peck Manuscript&quot; p. 3; HC 3 xxix [cited in Tanner, The Mormon Kingdom 1:4]. <br>
June 22, 1834. D&amp;C 105:13-15. The Lord says regarding Missouri: &quot;I will fight your battles... the destroyer I have sent forth to destroy and lay waste mine enemies; and not many years hence they shall not be left to pollute mine heritage, and to blaspheme my name upon the lands which I have consecrated for the gathering together of my saints.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The Missouri opponents of the Mormons were not destroyed, but have remained in Missouri (and &quot;polluted&quot; it?) The Mormons were driven out of Missouri within five years. <br>
Aug 16, 1834. HC 2:145. Joseph Smith says that the Spirit of the Lord tells him that the Saints should be ready to move into Jackson County, Missouri, on September 11, 1836, &quot;which is the appointed time for the redemption of Zion.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: If Zion was redeemed in 1836, it was unredeemed in 1839, when the Mormons abandoned Missouri. <br>
FAR WEST TEMPLE: April 26, 1838. D&amp;C 115. Revelation concerning the city of Far West, Missouri, and the building of a temple there. God commands the temple to be built; the church will be gathered to Zion (Missouri), which will be &quot;for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm.&quot; Work on the temple is to commence in the summer of 1838, with construction to begin April 26, 1839, with work to continue &quot;diligently until it shall be finished, from the corner stone thereof unto the top thereof, until there shall not anything remain that is not finished.&quot; (v. 12) Verse 17: &quot;I say unto you, it is my will that the city of Far West should be built up speedily by the gathering of my saints.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The temple cornerstone was laid, but no more work was ever done and the temple is still not completed. Far West was abandoned by the Mormons soon after this revelation. It would appear that the building of the Far West temple was not the work of God, since God's work cannot be frustrated (see D&amp;C 3:3). <br>
LIBERTY JAIL PROPHECIES: March 20, 1839. D&amp;C 121. This is &quot;Prayer and Prophecies&quot; from Joseph Smith while he was a prisoner in the jail at Liberty, Missouri. It contains several prophecies: <br>
·        he will be avenged of his enemies by the sword (v. 5) (this is phrased as a prayer, but God had promised Joseph Smith that his prayers would be answered; he need only ask. D&amp;C 29:6) <br>
·        his friends will not charge him with transgressions (v. 10) <br>
·        the hopes of those who do charge him with transgression shall have their hope blasted (v. 11) <br>
·        God will &quot;change the times and seasons&quot; (v. 12) <br>
·        Joseph Smith's enemies will be taken &quot;in their own craftiness&quot; (v. 12) <br>
·        &quot;not many years hence, ... [his enemies] and their posterity shall be swept from under heaven, saith God, that not one of them is left to stand by the wall.&quot; (v. 15) <br>
·        knowledge will be poured down from heaven upon the heads of the Mormons. <br>
FULFILLMENT: None of these prophecies came to pass. Joseph Smith's enemies were not destroyed &quot;by the sword;&quot; rather, the Mormons were successfully driven out of Missouri. His friends did charge him with transgressions within a few years, and those charges (in The Nauvoo Expositor) resulted directly in his arrest and destruction, as his enemies wished. God did not &quot;change the times and seasons,&quot; whatever that may mean. In general, the enemies of the Mormons achieved their goal of driving the Mormons out and destroying Joseph Smith. Their posterity was not destroyed, but survived. At least, there is no record of the anti-Mormon Missourians being swept away. And what knowledge has been &quot;poured down from heaven&quot; upon the Mormons since 1839? <br>
(One might wonder why Smith spent so long in prison; according to the Book of Mormon , Mormon 8:24, faith can make prison walls tumble.) <br>
End of the Missouri prophecies <br>
************************<br>
Again, time will prove these.  We believe that Jackson County MO is where Christ will return.<br>
<br>
As far as the enemies of the church, there is an interesting book (which I am still trying to locate) which details the lives of those who were in the mob that murdered JS.  Each and everyone of them died terrible deaths.  Sounds to me that God was dealing out a bit of justice there.  Gov Boggs who wrote the extermination order had a bad ending as well.<br>
***************************<br>
<br>
ICE SHALL FLOW: Nov 3, 1831. D&amp;C 133:26. Those &quot;who are in the north countries... shall smite the rocks, and the ice shall flow down at their presence.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The church has made no claim that this prophecy has been fulfilled. Besides, what does it mean? <br>
CHRIST'S SECOND COMING IS IMMINENT: Joseph Smith prophesied on several occasions that the Second Coming was to be expected very soon. <br>
Nov 3, 1831. D&amp;C 133:17. &quot;The hour of [Christ's Second] coming is nigh.&quot; <br>
Nov 13, 1833. &quot;...a sure sign that the coming of Christ is clost [close] at hand.&quot; <br>
April 23, 1834. D&amp;C 104:59. &quot;...to prepare my people for the time when I shall dwell with them, which is nigh at hand.&quot; <br>
Nov 25, 1834. D&amp;C 106:4. &quot;The coming of the Lord draweth nigh...&quot; <br>
Apr 3, 1836, D&amp;C 110:16. &quot;The great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors.&quot; <br>
Feb 14, 1835. HC 2:182. Joseph Smith preached that the coming of the Lord would be in 56 years (i.e., about 1891). This prophecy also occurs in his diary for April 6, 1843 and HC 5:336. See also D&amp;C 130:14-17. Joseph Smith prophesies that &quot;there of those of the rising generation who shall not taste death till Christ comes.&quot; He prophesies &quot;in the name of the Lord God - let it be written: that the Son of Man will not come in the heavens till I am 85 years old, 48 years hence or about 1890.&quot; (The official historians have deleted the last phrase, beginning with &quot;48 years&quot; from the church history, but it is contained in the original diary.) The version in D&amp;C 130 is phrased negatively, i.e., Christ will not come before 1890. It is also made conditional on Joseph Smith living to the age of 85. Joseph Smith says (v 16) that it might merely mean that if he lives to 85 he will go where Christ is, and therefore see his face. But that interpretation would not make sense if the revelation is in response to Joseph Smith's inquiry about the time of the second coming (v 14). <br>
FULFILLMENT: The second coming did not occur about 1891, and the Church does not claim that it did. Nor has it occurred since. Joseph Smith did not live to be 85 years old. God must have known that he would not. Why would God make a revelation conditional upon an event which he knew would never happen? <br>
*********************<br>
Again these deal with the 2nd coming which has not happened.  In regards to the prophecy about it happening when JS was 85.  He was inquiring the Lord as to the date.  The answer was not that it would happen then, but the answer was.  &quot;if he lived to be 85 he would see the 2nd coming.&quot;  the question was why would the Lord say such a thing.  The answer.  It was a subtle way of saying, you don't need to worry about that.<br>
***********************<br>
<br>
Next claim:NATIONS SHALL TREMBLE: Nov 3, 1831. D&amp;C 133:42 &quot;...all nations shall tremble at thy presence.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: No one can claim that all nations tremble at the presence of the Mormons. <br>
*** Again they conveniently left out part of the scripture  &quot;O Lord, thou shalt come down.... and all nations shall tremble at thy presence.&quot;  This is saying that all nations shall tremble at the 2nd coming of the Lord - NOT at Mormons.<br>
<br>
***************************<br>
next claim  <br>
ENEMIES WILL BE SHAMED: Dec 1, 1831. D&amp;C 71:7-10 Mormons are to call upon their enemies to meet them both in public and in private, and the shame of their enemies shall be made manifest. &quot;No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: The Mormons are generally reluctant to discuss their religion with anyone but prospective converts, but, when they have been willing to meet with their critics and debate, they have not been particularly able to make their opponents' shame manifest. The Missourians and the residents of Hancock County, Illinois, who &quot;formed weapons&quot; against the Mormons, were successful in driving them out. <br>
<br>
This commandment was not given to Mormons at large but was given specifically to JS and Sidney Rigdon.  And since none of us were there in the conversations that they had with those who were their enemies, none can say that their enemies were or werent confounded or ashamed.  Also in re: to no weapon shall prosper. Even if the saints were driven out of MO, we are now the fastest growing church in the US and have 10 million members worldwide, so the enemies were not succesful in wiping out the church (did not prosper)<br>
 also the last verse, verse 11 indictes that this would happen in the Lords due time. ( so not necessarily immediately)<br>
*************************<br>
Next claim <br>
FULFILLMENT: This prophecy is the one most often cited by Mormons to prove Joseph Smith's prophetic power. However, most Mormons are unaware of the political situation in America at the time it was made. In November 1832 South Carolina had declared its power to &quot;nullify&quot; any federal act, and President Jackson was prepared to go to war to enforce federal authority. Most people expected war. Thus the &quot;prophecy&quot; did no more than reflect commonly held opinion. Even when the South did finally revolt, in 1861, although Great Britain came to its assistance, other elements of the prophecy were not fulfilled: slaves did not rise up, war was not poured out upon all nations, there was no world- wide famine, plague, earthquake, etc., and there was no resulting &quot;end of all nations.&quot; Morris, PJS, contends that World War I, the associated famines, the 1918 influenza epidemic, fulfill this prophecy. But these are not as a result of the American Civil War. (see Chron JS, Dec 1832) Not even Morris claims that there were earthquakes because of it. <br>
*********<br>
There are two separate prophesies here.  The civil war which has happened (and yes there were slaves who fought against &quot;their masters&quot; or on the side of the union.<br>
<br>
The 2nd prophesy begins in verse 6.  It is again a reflection of what will happen prior to the coming of the Savior.  Earthquakes ( which have dramatically increased over the last century) wars and bloodshed (yeah this is happening) fierce lightening (yes this happens) All of these things will continue to happen UNTIL the end of all Nations which will happen prior to the 2nd coming of the Lord.<br>

STARS WILL FALL: Dec 27, 1832. D&amp;C 88:87. Earth shall tremble and reel, the sun shall not give light, the moon shall be bathed in blood, the stars shall &quot;become exceedingly angry&quot; and fall, all &quot;not many days hence.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: More than 59,000 days have now passed, and this prophecy has not been fulfilled. It is doubtful that in any sense the stars will ever fall. (This is a paraphrase of Isa 13:10, as re-paraphrased by Matt 24:29 and Mark 13:25.)<br>
********************<br>
AGAIN talking about the 2nd coming - the  rest of the prophesies that deal with this I will just skip as the answer is the same<br>
***************<br>
<br>
Next claim- DESTROYING ANGEL WILL PASS BY: Feb 27, 1833. D&amp;C 89. The &quot;Word of Wisdom&quot; promises that those who obey it (i.e., by abstaining from hot or strong drinks and from tobacco) shall &quot;receive health in their navel...; find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge...; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And... the destroying angel shall pass by them... and not slay them.&quot; <br>
FULFILLMENT: Most Mormons observe the &quot;Word of Wisdom&quot; faithfully. Although Mormons have been shown statistically to have fewer health problems than the average American, they still seem to be subject to being slain by the destroying angel. Nor do they seem to have greater wisdom and knowledge than others because of their avoidance of coffee, alcohol and tobacco. <br>
*****<br>
The wisdom and knowledge is spiritual, so I would have to say that yes we have gained this.  It is also wisdom to avoid harmful substances.(especially 150 years before science proved why we should avoid them)<br>
***********************<br>
Next claim - THE UNITED ORDER - EVERLASTING: Apr 23, 1834. D&amp;C 104. Revelation establishing a separate United Order in Missouri, to be &quot;everlasting&quot; (v 1), &quot;immutable and unchangeable&quot; (v 2), to benefit the church &quot;until I come&quot; (v 1). &quot;This is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints...&quot; (v 16). <br>
FULFILLMENT: The United Order (holding all property in common) failed, even though the saints tried valiantly to make it work. It was attempted in Ohio, Missouri and Utah. Nowhere did it survive. It was not everlasting. It was not immutable or unchangeable, since it was tried with numerous variations. It has not provided for the saints. It has not lasted until the Lord has come. <br>
********<br>
<br>
The part that is missing here is that this revelation is given after the failure of that.  The Lord is chatising the saints for failing.  He told them that he had commanded this and had promised immutable and unchangeable blessings. (not that the order would be unchangable or unmutable)  we believe that at the 2nd coming of Christ, this type of order will be re-established.<br>
******************************<br>
Next claim - MORMON DEBTS WILL BE PAID: April 23, 1834. D&amp;C 104: 78-83. God's promise to deliver the Saints from their debts. &quot;It is my will that you shall pay all your debts.&quot; The Lord will soften the hearts of their creditors. <br>
FULFILLMENT: Joseph Smith and other prominent Mormons had to flee Kirtland to avoid their creditors, leaving debts of thousands of dollars unpaid. Smith ultimately filed bankruptcy. <br>
*********************<br>
Sorry, the reason for leaving Kirtland was persecution.  There was no reference here.  so I will dismiss this as hersay as well.<br>
**************<br>
OK I have spent several hours here.  I have discredited each and every claim so far.  As you can see the people who put these claims together conveniently  leave out any information that doesnt mesh with the negative slant, they would like to promote.  I don't feel the need to waste anymore time pointing out what any person who has the time and energy to look up the original references could find out on their own.  Feel free to go to the originals locations of the rest of these references and check it out yourself.  Or better yet, do a check on the people promoting this crap and find out why they arent members anymore ( adultry, criminal activity,  etc.)  -- Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/25/03 11:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=87.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: part two</span><hr size=1> DBC did a good job of pointing out why the tireless claim that anything debunking Smith is anti-LDS (no doubt any site with anything negative would receive the same label).

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Joseph Smith did not want to accept it or practice it. But was commanded that if he did not put it into practice the Lord would remove him from his position(death) - Another reason that it was not made public, was the persecution of the church and members was already so great (murder, rape,pillaging, false accusations in court etc) And yes there were some who left the church because they could not accept the practice when it was made known.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Oh brother---yeah what a terrible burden god placed on him by forcing him to have several wives and then lie about it…really, is this a rebuttal or an excuse? And as for murder and pillaging…how about the Mountain Meadows Massacre which until the Oklahoma City Bombing was the greatest act of terrorism American on American in US history—even killing all children above age 8 (you know, since they are so accountable and all). Were Mormons ever persecuted—sure, did they act just as horribly in return and murder children—you bet. You may not have more blood on your hands then the other xian sects, but you don’t have less either.<br>

No, it is not presumptuous, but I will say that I fairness this applies to all theists who think praying for special treatment gets them somewhere. <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
This is semantics. What the Lord wanted was the saints to be all together. The second half of that, that we no longer gather is true.

Living revelation means that as needs change so does his will concerning what we do.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, an admission that the statement was true coupled with apologetics. This is not a refutation.<br>
<br>
The whole enemies coming to an end was never even verified, but it’s another silly attempt to confirm a prophesy. Had Hitler lived long enough he may have contracted cancer or been killed by a mugger. That’s not proof of divine justice, just proof that bad things happen to bad people as well as good people. (Lots of good folks who had nothing to do with Smith I am sure also met bad ends also—Post hoc ergo proper hoc I believe)<br>
<br>
All the second coming comments can be refuted by asserting what DBC already said regarding “short” versus “long” times. To say 160 years isn’t that long in the history of the world is another apologetic approach, not an explanation or refutation with merit. Goodness sakes, if I say I’ll be right over to your house soon and take 5 hours can I claim that 5 hours really is “soon” in the span of all human time?<br>

I've addressed the source issue, but if you feel more comfortable I can refer to sources neither Lighthouse or LDS. Do you have one you prefer? You only give LDS source material while all of us here have used everything from atheist to neutral to xian denom sites...wouldn't matter. Fact is Smith didn't speak egyptian, made crap up and died protecting a cult he started that worshipped him as the prophet of god himself. Maybe he believed it, maybe he was delusional, or maybe he was desperate to keep a good thing going. Many have died for less.<br>

I often feel the same way about theists (see every dag thread), but you see I believe deeply in human beings and our capacity to change and see reason and truth. It is frustrating to discuss things with those who will seek informatin only from their own church, but perhaps with enough exposure this will change.<br>

Are you asserting that every Lighthouse member was an adulterer or criminal or that every LDS critic is such? This was a disappointing comment and I may just check out as many debunkers of Smith as possible. I already know the author of the articles on American Atheist was never a member of your church and is neither of these things...you see we atheists just commit so much less crime and divorce so little compared to xians. Resorting to personal attacks on those who criticize your prophet not only leaves you standing with a weak or non-exitant argument, it leaves you looking bitter and defensive. One wonders if there were not so much evidence against Smith and the BoM and so little evidence supporting it if the reaction would be different.<br>

Well yes and no. My MIL is JW and dh was raised that way and I have had opportunity recently to investigate the formation and split (after a few end of times dates came and went with no 2nd coming) of this sect and never thought Charles Russell claimed to be a prophet. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is part of the reason the JW organization to this day does not have the hierarchy the LDS, Catholic and Episcopaleans do. Charles Russell did not invent additional biblical texts (though I think he has some interesting interpretations and other thoughts about the bible), take several wives or fabricate documents or tablets using made up languages proven to be false. I do recall a run in with the law, but unfortunately cannot remember whether it was civil or crimnal...might have been one of the heirs. <br>
<br>
Do I see problems with some of the key JW players especially when the second (how many have there been now? can't recall that either--2 or 3?) prediction about the end of the world didn't come true and so many members were lost. Do I see Charles Russell as a charlatan in the same way? Not really.

How about Haun's Mill - 17 men women and children murdered.  this is from a &quot;neutral&quot; site as far as I can tell.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's a bit of a head-scratcher, but, believe it or not, once upon a time it was legal to kill Mormons in Missouri. In fact, Governor Lilburn W. Boggs issued an Extermination Order in 1838 which demanded that Latter Day Saints leave the state or be killed. Why was the Governor so upset with the Mormons? Well, ever since the Mormons had been moving into Missouri there were rumors spreading that the Latter Day Saints were planning to &quot;despoil&quot; the Missourians and take their land. So, you know, tensions grew and they came to a boil at Haun's Mill in Northwestern Missouri on October 30, 1838. Some 200-250 militia attacked the mill and 17 Mormons and one friendly non-Mormon were killed; another 13 were wounded, including one woman and a seven year old boy. Certain deaths were particularly offensive to the Saints. Seventy-eight-year-old Thomas McBride surrendered his musket to militiaman Jacob Rogers, who shot him, then hacked his body with a corn knife. William Reynolds discovered ten-year-old Sardius Smith hiding under the bellows and blew the top of the child's head off. While women cared for the wounded, the men remained in hiding during the night. The dead were thrown into an unfinished well and lightly covered with dirt and straw. A few Missourians returned the next day, took plunder, and warned the remaining Saints to leave Missouri. Now, don't stories like that just make you proud to be an American? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Mormons were tormented and killed, houses burned, men tarred and feathered, women raped, property stolen, all with the backing of the MO and IL militias and governments. <br>
<br>
The saints were driven our of OH, IL, MO.  They cleared and developed farm lands, built cities, and temples, only to have to leave them in the hands of vile murderers.<br>
<br>
They walked from IL to the Salt Lake Valley, loosing many husbands wives and children on the way.<br>
The saints left the boundaries of the US in order to have the right to freedom of religion that was their constitutional right.  They had to start over in the desert.  <br>
<br>
 So to compare YEARS(decades)  of institutionalized mistreatment and persecution with one passionate act of some &quot;unforgiving&quot; Mormons on a group of Missiourians who chose to pass through Utah on their way to CA is pretty pale in comparison.  And by the way, all those who were involved were prosectuted (not protected nor condoned by the church)<br>
<br>
If I sound a little bitter or angry, it is because these (anti)people have taken the facts and twisted them and bent them in order to promote hate and misinformation re: my church.  And it frustrates me that people just accept the quotes and lists like the one above as fact without even considering that the sources they site may not be legitimate or that they may be misquoting (leaving out key pieces of information)  Never calling into question their motives.<br>
<br>
On the statement about the type of people putting this garbage out, I may have misspoke.  But I know of specific people who were excommuncated because of adultry or criminal activity and because of their bitterness have devoted their life to slandering the church.  Others had bad family or personal experiences and blame the church and so put much effort into maligning the church.  (one example, a lady on BC's husband was arrested for molesting a child, he was molested by an LDS scout leader, so she blames the church and has so much hate and hostility that every chance she gets, she spouts all the hate propaganda)<br>
<br>
I dont know of one LDS person who is living a moral life according the gospel who has chosen to leave the church.  The only people I know personally who have left the church are those who have started &quot;breaking the commandments&quot; and then in order to bring their beliefs into line with their actions, have started doubting the faith.  Its a matter of congruency.  Humans feel uncomfortable if their beliefs and actions are not in harmony, so in order to create harmony, they either have to change their actions or change their beliefs.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;hearing&quot; or seeing other sources than just LDS, I have personally visited Catholic Mass, Evangelical Christian and Jewish services.  I have discussed religion IRL with Catholics, JW's, SDA, Fundamentalist Christians, Episcopalians, agnostics, even atheists.  I have dear friends who were once LDS, who are not LDS now.  Half my family is LDS half isnt.  Both my parents are converts.  My grandparents were Methodist and Agnostic.  I have a very well rounded understanding of the religions around me.  I have studied my own faith and have been a missionary.  I know my churchs history and I know that lots of people apostatized  in the early days of the church and many negative things were said by a number of these people.  Some stayed out of the church, some returned.   <br>
<br>
I know what I believe is true because of spiritual evidence that has been given to me on a personal level.  Little miracles in my life. Answers to my prayers, guidance and direction in choices that were laid before me.  I know what the spirit feels like and I know  the peace and joy that comes from knowing that and feeling it in my life.<br>
<br>
I know Joseph Smith.  This is the same man, who when he heard of a neighbors misfortune said to the group of men with him &quot;I am sorry to hear that, I am sorry $5 worth, how sorry are the rest of you?&quot;  This is the same man who in Nauvoo, IL had a grocery store that never turned a profit because he kept giving away product to people who couldnt pay.  This is the same man who as a teen came upon a man beating his wife, he and the other teen with him stepped in to protect the woman.  There are hundreds of experiences like these recorded in personal journals from that era.  Again I refer you to the historian - Truman G Madsen who documents the prophets life in a series of taped lectures. He sites the journals where he got the information.<br>
<br>
And just for the record JS did have a difficult time accepting the revelation on plural marriage. (see Danel W. Bachman &quot;A study of the Mormon Practice of plural marriage before the death of Joseph Smith&quot; a masters thesis Perdue University 1975)<br>

No--it isn't and this is according to an objective source that was NOT found on an anti-Mormon website. You can find information about the massacre and how those who participated felt the were retaliating against the sort of injustices you mention inflicted on LDS on SEVERAL objective sites. I was not blindly accepting some other cults word for this. I used to teach history and knew of the massacre looooong before surfing the net and bulleting boarding.<br>

Just because &quot;your people&quot; suffered doesn't mean what they did was okay, nor does it mean it was not terrorism, nor does it mean that we don't acknowledge Mormons were mistreated.

But I never got facts about the massacre from a religious website. I get them from actual real life books that you can touch and feel and objective videos and historical sites. Your offense is alot like white people objective feverishly at having slavery taught in schools. It happened, it was wrong, but it was real. <br>
<br>
BTW--you know what frustrates me? Having a religious person assume that just because she gets all her data from a biased religious text and organization that I do too. I formed my opinions of LDS and continue to form them largely through contact with &quot;saints&quot; and as I have said before learn more and more and grow more and more leary of the faith based on conversations and information from you yourselves.

<br>
I was raised Catholic, so I know a lot about Catholic beliefs and history.  I feel that if one wants to know the specifics about certain Catholic doctrines, one should go to a Catholic website where explanations of the catechism are available.  However, if one wants to know the &quot;warts and all&quot; history of the Church (politics, corrupt popes, oppression, torturing of non-believers)--well, you may not find that on a Catholic-sponsored site.  I wouldn't go to a site sponsored by Catholic haters, either, as there is an agenda there.  I would look for objective historical sites.<br>
<br>
Since I know very little about JS and LDS and have found these discussions interesting, I decided to see what I could find out on my own.  I found a plethora of LDS-sponsored sites, and a few &quot;anti&quot; sites that I would not trust as being objective (you know, evangelicals desperate to prove that everyone else is wrong).  But I did find several sites that gave historical info not only about JS/LDS, but about many religions and their leaders.  These sites seemed to be for the sole purpose of providing historical info, and not some disgruntled ex-Mormon or fundie fanatic with an agenda.  What I read there was not very favorable with regards to JS, they said much of what ST was saying.<br>
<br>
My question is, do you consider any site (or book) which gives historical information unfavorable to JS or LDS to be anti-Mormon?  Would a book containing accurate information about Hilter be considered &quot;anti-Nazi&quot; by your definition?  (Just trying to see where you are coming from here).  I'm curious to know if you think all of the history which was written about JS which is not endorsed by the LDS and is not flattering to him is just inaccurate information, or a deliberate attempt to discredit the Mormon church--and what would be the motive for so many historians to paint such a picture, assuming they are not promoting a different religion and do not have a gripe with the church?  Also, can you recommend any site which is not LDS sponsored which gives objective information more consistent with LDS beliefs about JS?  I'm really not trying to debate you on this, I'm genuinely interested in learning more about it, and so far it seems that history agrees with what the A/A members have been saying here.  I'd like to know if there is indeed another side.<br>

<br>
I did just want to say quickly that this man led a very difficult life full of physical and emotional persecution.  The few things Shirene mentioned that he and his family suffered through are a drop in the bucket.  It's really sad.  I know this is a &quot;no holds barred&quot; debate board so don't think I'm trying to police the tone of the posts or anything like that, just trying, for the sake of understanding where people are coming from, to say that seeing someone rake his life over the coals of &quot;critical analysis&quot; is, for us, like watching a mother who had just lost a child during childbirth have to answer for every mistake or misunderstanding that happened in her life.  Yes..she probably did make some mistakes and in other cases people probably misunderstood her and a tragedy in her life doesn't resolve all of that...but still, you feel a bit defensive for her.  Yes...I know...Joseph Smith isn't actually here reading this, but those of us who hold him in esteem feel defensive for him for these reasons.<br>
<br>
Don't think I'm mistaking this response here as a rebuttal to any of the arguments...just a quick comment to help you understand why some people feel the way they do when Joseph Smith is presented as a liar and looney.  Feeling the way we do about him, it isn't fun to see and it comes off as disrespectful.  Personally, I would not talk to a Catholic about the Pope in this manner for instance, because I understand that *to them* it would be considered disrespectful...but again, this IS a debate board, so not complaining, just explaining.<br>
<br>
Hopefully I will be back later to help Shirene answer some of the questions about Joseph Smith.  I see that there are understandably some sincere questions, I guess the whole &quot;liar and looney&quot; thread title just bothered me enough that I needed to say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>something</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> even though I don't have time to add anything substantial right now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Hope I didn't sound like I thought the entire thread was disprespectufl or anything like that, just trying to shed a little light on what it feels like from our end of things. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whanda>Whanda</A> at: 1/27/03 7:50:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mormongirl2>Mormongirl2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/27/03 11:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=87.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Julie</span><hr size=1> Julie, I think it is very difficult to be neutral on the subject of Joseph Smith.  I havent found a website yet that I consider neutral, but I will keep looking so that I can give you a link to look at.<br>
<br>
The reason I think it is hard to be neutral is because of the nature of his life and Mormonism in general.  I will try to illustrate...<br>
<br>
When he was 14 he had a visit from God the Father and Jesus Christ.Most of the Christian world believes in the evasively descriptive Trinty, so this immediately flew in the face of almost all other christian churches at the time.  It was also a time of religious fever and lots of people were already pretty intense in religious debate, so when a 14 yo comes out and says, you are all wrong in your beliefs, it didnt set well.<br>
<br>
Jump forward to the Book of Mormon.  Again main stream Evangelical Christianity feels that the Bible is the only word of God.  And to have new scriptures again flies in the face of everything they had been teaching and accepting.<br>
<br>
And then to top it off, people in their congregations started converting to this new religion.  It was more than the religious leaders at the time could bear.  They weren't threatened by other main stream evangelical christian denominations, but if JS was right and he really did have a visit from God and the BoM is really His word, that in effect meant that they were completely wrong, and we all know how we feel when someone tells us that we are completely wrong.  It makes us a little annoyed and defensive.<br>
<br>
Jump forward to the beginning of the practice of Polygamy.  It was another excuse to promote hate and intolerance of JS and the saints.  It was easy to twist into something &quot;dirty&quot; or vile because it was against the norms of 1800's America.  <br>
<br>
Historical documents from that period are pretty polarized.  Those things that are written in LDS newspapers or personal journals, tell the good things and the those newpapers and personal journals from those who hated the mormons are of course slanted according to their bias.<br>
<br>
Even today, so called Christian churches have seminars on why Mormons are a cult or evil.  How to live with Mormon neighbors (which by the way is a seminar on how evil we are) Mormon hating is still in vogue even in our age of political correctness.  You dont say anything negative about a persons race or sexual preferance, but if you hate someone because of the church they attend, that is OK.<br>
<br>
This is why it is hard to find a neutral historical view.  History itself was written from two biased perspectives.  And it is still a polarized topic.  Either he was a Prophet of God or he was a fraud.  And if he was a prophet of God, then you have to accept the things he taught as true.  Those people who read the BoM, pray about what they read and accept it as from God, join the church and then are suddenly included in the LDS bias.  Those people who choose not to accept him as a prophet can only believe that he purposely mislead others,which would make him a pretty vile person or he suffered from delusions and his mental illness is the basis for our religion.  Not much neutral ground.<br>
<br>
I of course fall into the category of those who believe that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ visited him and called him to be the instrument in restoring the church that Christ estblished when he was here in Mortality. <br>

It was done out of fear and desperation.  <br>
<br>
Imagine building a home, having it burned down and being chased to another city.  Building another home, having it burned down and chased to another city, do that several more times.  Then you move all the way across the country (walking all the way there in horrible conditions, some of your family die on the way because of the hardship) and build another home.  And then you hear that some of the same people who had burnt you out of your homes and drove you out of your cities had followed you there to your new home.  You might take some pretty desperate measures. <br>
<br>
I dont agree with what they did, but I can in a small way understand what drove them to such violence.<br>

If it were an act of war it would have been waged between differing governments and relied upon soldiers. If it were done with the express intent of frightening people out of coming back or others from passing through there then: fear = terror -&gt; Terrorism (QED)<br>
<br>
Irrespective of the semantics involved, it is another example of the xians persecuting the xians. Violence in the name of the almighty war santa. Hate crimes in the name of god. Typical of the nonsecular world and just reaffirmation of the damage religions cause.<br>

I don't know much about it, and I may be wrong, but from what Shirene said, this sounds more like taking the law in their own hands.  I doesn't sound like they did it in the name of God.  It was a misguided (and horrible...I don't condone the act) attempt at justice.  Similar to if you went out and killed someone who raped you daughter.  You didn't do it in the name of anybody.  You were just pissed.<br>
