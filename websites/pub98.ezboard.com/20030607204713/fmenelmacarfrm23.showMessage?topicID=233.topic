GSquid314(9:53:49 PM): Good morning, everyone<br>
ilikeinanenames(9:53:55 PM): That's who I've been looking for.<br>
Jasonian22(9:53:57 PM): Good evening.<br>
ilikeinanenames(9:54:00 PM): How are you, GS?<br>
GSquid314(9:54:01 PM): Uh oh...<br>
GSquid314(9:54:07 PM): I'm fine, thank you. How are you?<br>
slobkaiser1(9:54:29 PM): I don't feel like negociating anything tonight guys...I'm like tired<br>
ilikeinanenames(9:54:42 PM): I understand that<br>
GSquid314(9:54:51 PM): And the award for most gratuitious usage of the word &quot;like&quot; goes to...........<br>
Jasonian22(9:55:06 PM): Hah! Scott had me up to 3 AM on a school night for an Audentior chat one time.<br>
ilikeinanenames(9:55:19 PM): I'm really good, thanks. Anyways, I'm here because it is clear that activity is dropping everywhere.<br>
GSquid314(9:55:28 PM): Well, it's not my fault you live in a heathen time zone<br>
Jasonian22(9:56:11 PM): Well, it's not my fault you had to ban UEC and were too big-headed to say you were sorry.<br>
Jasonian22(9:56:23 PM): Anyway, mergers.<br>
(9:56:27 PM)AngusOnAir has left the room.<br>
GSquid314(9:56:30 PM): Well, it's not my fault he was bombing all over the place and threatening to WHA?!?!?!!<br>
GSquid314(9:56:41 PM): YOU SAID THE WORD! YOU SAID THE WORD!<br>
ilikeinanenames(9:56:46 PM): Menelmacars, Baracao, Shireoth, Slobovia, Delvenus<br>
Jasonian22(9:56:47 PM): I do not remember him threatening to WHA.<br>
slobkaiser1(9:56:54 PM): I'm in no condition to negociate right now...DO NOT EXPLOIT ME<br>
ilikeinanenames(9:56:56 PM): I cannot think of anybody else.<br>
Jasonian22(9:57:16 PM): Fine. Not one of those. It is a collecive gathering of... umm... is there a good synonym for &quot;evil&quot;?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>GSquid314(9:57:17 PM): Three words, five if you count contractions as two separate words: ain't gonna happen</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
ilikeinanenames(9:57:17 PM): I am here indepedently, by the way. I haven't even talked about this to the higher ups of Baracao<br>
ilikeinanenames(9:57:47 PM): Well, it seems to me it's do something big or enjoy inactivity?<br>
ilikeinanenames(9:58:08 PM): Sure, it'll most likely fail. But at least everybody will be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>super angry in the end and end up making new, active nations.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>GSquid314(9:58:44 PM): I'm afraid you're thinking logically. Ramon will nix it. Archy willdefinitely nix it. Erik will definitely nix it. Mari will consult with Jadieand then nix it.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Jasonian22(9:58:56 PM): Jadie would likely be for it.<br>
Jasonian22(9:59:08 PM): I am for it in fact.<br>
GSquid314(9:59:08 PM): She'd say Delvenus was neutral. It's been tried<br>
ilikeinanenames(9:59:25 PM): Ramon will nix it but know that Baracao is on a downward spiral.<br>
Jasonian22(9:59:27 PM): It has been tried, but it has not really been tried.<br>
GSquid314(9:59:35 PM): I tried to convince the Delvenusians to merge with Shireroth half-heartedly, and they said no way, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Delvenus doesn't merge, ever.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> [CU was asked to merge and forma sister nation back when it was first formed.]<br>
ilikeinanenames(9:59:39 PM): Our higher ups have done an amazing job making us appear active.<br>
slobkaiser1(9:59:45 PM): I'm for it...but we shouldn't go into specifics about it until a later date<br>
Jasonian22(9:59:50 PM): Jasonia said that Scott.<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:00:02 PM): I agree with Troy. First we need to agree, then do specifics.<br>
GSquid314(10:00:04 PM): Yeah, but you're a vacillating softy<br>
Jasonian22(10:00:20 PM): Or I was really bored. I cannot remember.<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:01:15 PM): Well, is anybody a citizen of Delvenus an nowhere else?<br>
Jasonian22(10:01:35 PM): Possibly, but I cannot think of anyone offhand.<br>
GSquid314(10:01:37 PM): I think Jubbles, but he's not very active<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:02:02 PM): Exactly. So who cares if Delvenus won't merge if all it's citizens are citizens elsewhere?<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:02:24 PM): 8-)<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>GSquid314(10:02:51 PM): Because nowhere else will merge?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
(10:03:02 PM)AngusOnAir has entered the room.<br>
Jasonian22(10:03:15 PM): That kind of &quot;who cares&quot; mentality can get out of hand when trying to set up mergers.<br>
AngusOnAir(10:03:18 PM): sorry all my power got knock out<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>GSquid314(10:03:19 PM): The only place that has a chance in the PRH of agreeing is Sirimacar,which is rather funny because as soon as Sirimacar is in everyone else willremember they're Evil (TM) and be out</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
GSquid314(10:03:34 PM): Besides, a country can't merge with itself.<br>
GSquid314(10:03:45 PM): Or rather, it could, but it would produce surprisingly little activity<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:03:54 PM): I think perhaps people will be more motivated when they realize that this time it isn't for ideological reasons, it is for 'do or die' reasons.<br>
GSquid314(10:04:16 PM): You honestly expect Baracao to put the practical above the ideological<br>
Jasonian22(10:04:19 PM): But humans are lazy, and laziness says &quot;oh, let's just die and be done with it&quot;<br>
Jasonian22(10:04:32 PM): Which is why everyone is leaving and how we got in this position to start with.<br>
AngusOnAir(10:07:28 PM): ok<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:07:53 PM): Well, I don't know what other options we can honestly look to.<br>
AngusOnAir(10:08:24 PM): who or what is mergering<br>
TsarevichAleksei(10:08:25 PM): i'm back<br>
AngusOnAir(10:08:53 PM): wb<br>
GSquid314(10:09:26 PM): Just so you know I'm sending a transcript of this to Archy<br>
Jasonian22(10:09:36 PM): Did you save it yet?<br>
GSquid314(10:09:39 PM): Who I mentioned this to and who seemed rather surprised but maybe interested<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:09:49 PM): Eh?<br>
GSquid314(10:09:59 PM): Since you did kind of suggest him merging<br>
Jasonian22(10:10:08 PM): Scott, did you save the transcript yet?<br>
GSquid314(10:10:10 PM): No<br>
Jasonian22(10:10:15 PM): Good<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jasonian22(10:10:24 PM): Archetype, you can shrivel and die. In the rain.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  [He's still acting like a queer]<br>
Jasonian22(10:10:26 PM): Okay, go ahead.<br>
GSquid314(10:10:31 PM): Anyway....<br>
TsarevichAleksei(10:10:57 PM): Cranda has no interest of merging, I'm here for Slobovia<br>
Jasonian22(10:11:00 PM): So does anyone have any ACTUAL ideas for this?<br>
GSquid314(10:11:01 PM): Hubert, why don't you talk about this to Ramon before we discuss thisfurther. Since he's not going to accept it, there isn't much point to ourdiscussing it.<br>
GSquid314(10:11:12 PM): (insert spaces where necessary)<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:11:18 PM): I will<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilikeinanenames(10:11:26 PM): I'll convince him</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
slobkaiser1(10:11:28 PM): I have ideas, but they'll be unpopular to non-Slobovians<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:11:30 PM): He knows Baracao is dead<br>
Jasonian22(10:11:35 PM): Good luck there.<br>
TsarevichAleksei(10:11:40 PM): i'll propose them<br>
GSquid314(10:11:42 PM): I didn't know Baracao was dead. They look semi-active<br>
AngusOnAir(10:11:52 PM): ya it did<br>
Jasonian22(10:11:58 PM): You know, these mergers always go better if we have a name.<br>
GSquid314(10:12:20 PM): Airamyt!<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:12:20 PM): The higher ups have done well to hide it.<br>
TsarevichAleksei(10:12:40 PM): in order to give a strong focal point of leadership and activity, the Slobovian Imperial family would gladly accept the position of top executive<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:12:45 PM): You guys name it. I came up with the idea, I can't think much more<br>
GSquid314(10:12:50 PM): How very altruistic of them.<br>
Jasonian22(10:13:12 PM): Nah, we have to almost fight a bloody civil war over that position.<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:13:32 PM): To be honest I think the nation would need to have the simpliest of simple systems. But we deal with that fun little aspect later.<br>
Jasonian22(10:13:50 PM): Yeah, too many nations die because over over preplanning.<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:14:06 PM): The new Baracaon system is so complicated for a nation of five people.<br>
TsarevichAleksei(10:14:23 PM): personally i find a perminent executive allows a nation to keep going<br>
slobkaiser1(10:14:35 PM): maybe if we blow the dust off our German history books, and look at an old confederation that lasted from 1815 to the 1840's we'll find a system of government<br>
Jasonian22(10:14:37 PM): Unless he gets bored or busy.<br>
TsarevichAleksei(10:15:09 PM): true<br>
Jasonian22(10:15:10 PM): *looks around* I guess I left my German history book in the other room.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>GSquid314(10:15:12 PM): Wasn't that a system of government that led to massive revolution and eventual tyrannic crushing?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
ilikeinanenames(10:15:16 PM): Can you guys all get this message and transscript around as much as possible?<br>
TsarevichAleksei(10:15:49 PM): i've never gotten bored, but we're talking about Troy here, not me<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>GSquid314(10:15:50 PM): And then eventually the Prussians coming in and taking over and wearing silly spiked hats all the time?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
slobkaiser1(10:16:01 PM): it's a simple form of government...but simple forms of government tend to leave the people hangin somewhere<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>GSquid314(10:16:11 PM): Yeah...like from a gallows</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Jasonian22(10:16:15 PM): I sense that mean that physically.<br>
Jasonian22(10:16:19 PM): Indeed Scott.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>GSquid314(10:17:02 PM): Tom...send it to Fidel Nico with a demand that he publish it in the Skyline or be declared an EVIL SLACKER (which he is)<br>
GSquid314(10:17:13 PM): I AM going to get that man to publish at least one more issue</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
TsarevichAleksei(10:17:14 PM): lol<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilikeinanenames(10:17:31 PM): Send this to Thomas GC!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
AngusOnAir(10:17:32 PM): lol<br>
TsarevichAleksei(10:17:34 PM): this is never going to work, how do you expect to get support for it<br>
Jasonian22(10:17:48 PM): Brute force, cunning language, and prayer.<br>
GSquid314(10:17:55 PM): I can send this to Erik, but he is never going to agree<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:18:14 PM): Can somebody send me the log so I can forward it?<br>
ilikeinanenames(10:18:19 PM): redsentry@yahoo.ca<br>

<br>
You have just entered room &quot;Merger Chat741.&quot;<br>
TsarevichAleksei has entered the room.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: comrades<br>
slobkaiser1: hey<br>
ilikeinanenames: Hola<br>
Thane of CATS has entered the room.<br>
ilikeinanenames: How are you all?<br>
slobkaiser1: I'm happier than ever<br>
Thane of CATS: quite an interesting chat<br>
TsarevichAleksei: good<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TsarevichAleksei: it's name has the forbidden word</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->TsarevichAleksei: lol<br>
slobkaiser1: Chat?<br>
ilikeinanenames: So,what are your opinions Kuralyov?<br>
Thane of CATS: i'd be for it, but i also doubt it'd work, especially in the long run...but like scott said, it's death would revitalize the sector<br>
ilikeinanenames: And also Archetype, I'd appreciate your feedback since you are a key player with your Menelmacar.<br>
ilikeinanenames: That is exactly the point right there<br>
Thane of CATS: how many nations would be in it, what would the government be, and how many citizens are my questions<br>
Thane of CATS: i think it'd pretty much have to be a republic, which could irritate some<br>
ilikeinanenames: Well I think those questions can all be answered after we have an agreement to merge.<br>
slobkaiser1: I don't think a republic will work right...it's less stable<br>
slobkaiser1: a lot of people makes it a little less stable<br>
TsarevichAleksei: that's right, straight out dictorship is the only way! :-P<br>
Thane of CATS: as long as it's  arepublic in name...i seriously doubt the baracaoans would agree to a monarchy<br>
ilikeinanenames: Perhaps a basic form of government, a republic, but with a strong central executive. Or something, like that<br>
TsarevichAleksei: let's have a bloody war where the winning nation's leader declares himself emperor<br>
slobkaiser1: I'm thinking Parliamentary Monarchy cloaked in the disquise of a republic<br>
ilikeinanenames: Well considering the Sector doesnt have a history of much monarchy I don't know how cool that would go over.<br>
Thane of CATS: especially these nations invovled, only one of which is a monarchy<br>
slobkaiser1: *hides face a little*<br>
Thane of CATS: well, one is a monarchy, the other some sort of crazy bastard royalist republic type gov<br>
Thane of CATS: wait, sirithil's menelmacar<br>
TsarevichAleksei: Menelmacar doesn't have an executive anymore<br>
slobkaiser1: Menelmacar=republic cloaked in the disquise of a monarchy<br>
TsarevichAleksei: we're fully direct democracy<br>
SirithilFeanor has entered the room.<br>
ilikeinanenames: Hola Sirithil<br>
SirithilFeanor: Hi<br>
ilikeinanenames: Glad you could make it. This is important stuff...do you have the transscript of the merge chat last night?<br>
slobkaiser1: um...maybe something with a form of government like and old central european confederation had might work<br>
Thane of CATS: the &quot;crazy bastard royalist republic type gov&quot; i mentioned is shireroth<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SirithilFeanor: *rolls eyes* /Another/ merge? Don't we usually do these things in November?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> [ Even drag queens can be funny]<br>
TsarevichAleksei: how do you expect the two menelmacars to merge into a single merger nation?<br>
Thane of CATS: do they really have to?<br>
ilikeinanenames: Because it is a do or die situation, Belci<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i don't believe so<br>
SirithilFeanor: OK, explain the situation, and no I don't have last nights transcript, I wasn't in the chat last night. If someone could forward it to me, that'd be great.<br>
slobkaiser1: *points at 1815 Treaty of Vienna for an idea on form of government*<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TsarevichAleksei: people were saying we were gonna die a month or two ago, i recall</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> [Least someone here understandings that people just cry wolf.]<br>
ilikeinanenames: Look, this is a merger of keeping things honestly alive. Everybody is suffering from extreme inactive<br>
TsarevichAleksei: well, this has happened before<br>
SirithilFeanor: Indeed it has, many a time<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i doubt micronationalism is in its last days now<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i remember all the times people said menelmacar was gonna die<br>
TsarevichAleksei: lol<br>
ilikeinanenames: Yes, but mergers always pump new life into everything<br>
slobkaiser1: especially when they collapse<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i don't recall tymaria's collapse causing much activity<br>
ilikeinanenames: Heh. Basically<br>
TsarevichAleksei: the head of state just came and declared it dead<br>
TsarevichAleksei: wow, so much activity<br>
Thane of CATS: yes, but all the wars and espionage and stuff<br>
TsarevichAleksei: that was when it was alive<br>
Archetype2357: Back sorta (hasn't read anything that's been posted)<br>
Thane of CATS: in its dying days<br>
TsarevichAleksei: and that doesn't require a merger<br>
slobkaiser1: it was when it was dieing<br>
Archetype2357: I'm only kind of hear.. still high on Methadone.. would Kuryalov please change his font color.. I'm color blind..<br>
Thane of CATS: this better?<br>
slobkaiser1: yep<br>
TsarevichAleksei: it's better for the rest of us too<br>
Archetype2357: Yes tahnk you Kuryalov<br>
TsarevichAleksei: lol<br>
Archetype2357: *color blind as all hell* heh<br>
AngusOnAir has entered the room.<br>
slobkaiser1: I seriousl doubt that Baracao would join any non-communist merger<br>
TsarevichAleksei: so do i<br>
Thane of CATS: remember that no one thought that the tymaria merger would get off the ground, but it did...although it was a different political scene back then<br>
Thane of CATS: two of the nations were megrers already<br>
TsarevichAleksei: got off the ground, yes<br>
TsarevichAleksei: but crashed and burned<br>
slobkaiser1: Baracao's idealistic...they aren't gonna give up their ideals<br>
ilikeinanenames has left the room.<br>
Thane of CATS: but now that we've seen the errors of tymcna hopefully fix it<br>
Thane of CATS: don't be so sure of that<br>
SirithilFeanor: Well, I'm not exactly going to adopt Baracaoan ideals, obviously. If I was willing to, we probably wouldn't have fought a cold war over it.<br>
ilikeinanenames has entered the room.<br>
ilikeinanenames: Sorry<br>
Thane of CATS: everyone would have to adapt, obviously, and there'd prolly be the tymarian system where each province keps their own internal affairs and systems the same<br>
slobkaiser1: I wouldn't ask anyone to  give up their ideals for anything though<br>
SirithilFeanor: That would be the only possibility, I think.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i believe this will decrease activity in many ways, it would remove a lot of diversity<br>
ilikeinanenames: Care to back that up Belci?<br>
TsarevichAleksei: with fewer nations fewer ideas can be represented<br>
Thane of CATS: but one country with many citizens would have more inteaction among legislators, etc<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i know i do radically different things and support radically different systems of government in most of the nations i'm a citizen of<br>
slobkaiser1: ok, here's an idea...<br>
ilikeinanenames: I'm the same, Belci<br>
slobkaiser1: we start out be trying to organize smaller merges between nations that are similar in culture (like Belci said last night) and then we eventually merge the mergers<br>
Archetype2357: Who started this project?<br>
slobkaiser1: Hubert<br>
ilikeinanenames: I did<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i don't support the final step in all this, merging the mergers<br>
Thane of CATS: if we do lots of small mergers, then the larger goal will most likely not be realized<br>
TsarevichAleksei: smaller mergers would work just fine for some nations<br>
Archetype2357: I'm not really for this.. I like the diversity in micronations.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: as do i<br>
Archetype2357: Like Baracao, and Menelmacar, and Babkha, and CU, and Cranda, I just think that diversity makes them all awesome.<br>
SirithilFeanor: me too.<br>
Archetype2357: I'm afraid combing them.. may harm them.<br>
ilikeinanenames: What's diversity without activity?<br>
Archetype2357: We have activity.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: diversity generates activity<br>
Archetype2357: Maybe you should check us out sometime?<br>
Archetype2357: We had over 160 post in the conclave in 4 days...<br>
Archetype2357: That's activity in my book.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilikeinanenames: It's all fun to stand around and make flashy forums and say &quot;look how original we are&quot; but who cares if you're the only one?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> [Maybe he didn't read what we said?]<br>
Archetype2357: What isy our idea of activity?<br>
slobkaiser1: activity isn't as important as diversity come to think of it<br>
TsarevichAleksei: exactly<br>
ilikeinanenames: The UAS was diverse<br>
Archetype2357: The micronational world period is diverse.. why lose that?<br>
TsarevichAleksei: there aren't any one man nations that i can think of anyway<br>
ilikeinanenames: And let me tell you that the UAS was a hub of activity during and afterwards<br>
TsarevichAleksei: the UAS was different<br>
TsarevichAleksei: they had a common source<br>
slobkaiser1: when we speak of the micronational world, I think we're looking at it in to narrow of a sight though<br>
Thane of CATS: maybe we should try to bring in nations from outside the sector<br>
TsarevichAleksei: we aren't all apollo<br>
Archetype2357: Definetly not all apollo.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: we aren't all hanoverian, we aren't all one type<br>
TsarevichAleksei: that's why tymaria failed<br>
TsarevichAleksei: that's why this'll fail<br>
Archetype2357: We are diverse, and that is what makes us neat in my opinion.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilikeinanenames: This isn't created to succeed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> [ROFLMAO what's the point then?]<br>
Archetype2357: Check this out Menelmacar makes a great example.<br>
ilikeinanenames: It's created to make activity, for fun<br>
TsarevichAleksei: we have activity<br>
TsarevichAleksei: it moves up and down<br>
Archetype2357: Menelmacar was too diverse in some peoples eyes and it ended up falling apart.  So apart The Imperium of Menelmacar is great.  However if rejoined the others we'd probably fall apart again from in fighting.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TsarevichAleksei: down periods will end without forcing a giant merger on people</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> [ Ding ding someones got it.]<br>
slobkaiser1: Kuralyov...sya that again since it looks like some might not have seen it<br>
TsarevichAleksei: seen what?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: Down periods, if you have problems with your nations activity fix those first.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Thane of CATS: Thane of CATS: maybe we should try to bring in nations from outside the sector<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: Don't go and join us all together so we have one LARGE inactive nation.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Thane of CATS: you mean that?<br>
TsarevichAleksei: oh yeah<br>
slobkaiser1: yep<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i saw that<br>
TsarevichAleksei: how do we do that though?<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i know cranda just sorta drifted into this sector<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilikeinanenames: It is too bad that GS or Jasonian are not here to remind us all how great the UAS was indeed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> [Yeah and how gracefully it failed.]<br>
slobkaiser1: establish ties with nations outside the sector<br>
Thane of CATS: aerlig, for example<br>
Archetype2357: Well I'm in another diplomatic chat, I leavey ou to discuss this.  I'll idle if you don't mind and log this to review it later.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: fine<br>
Archetype2357: I'm not for it right now, I'll let that be known.  I'm curious to be honest so I'll be happy to review the chat and present it to Menelmacar to look at.<br>
Archetype2357: Belci can fill me in too to help me understand what I'm reading if he doesn't mind.<br>
Archetype2357: Good luck with the discussions. :-)<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i'm good with that<br>
TsarevichAleksei: now, anyway<br>
slobkaiser1: *starts building a tower with empty pop cans*<br>
TsarevichAleksei: the UAS may well have been great, but everyone there was from apollo<br>
TsarevichAleksei: everyone here is from different places<br>
ilikeinanenames: Different lonely places<br>
TsarevichAleksei: hardly lonely<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TsarevichAleksei: hubertian diplomacy i see is somewhat lacking<br>
TsarevichAleksei: ilikeinanenames: You are so ignorant and stupid.ilikeinanenames: How do you wake up in the morning?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
ilikeinanenames: Well it's true<br>
TsarevichAleksei: that's a wonderful way of convincing people<br>
ilikeinanenames: He's making these inane, snipped little comments to piss me off<br>
TsarevichAleksei: hardly<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i'm countering your arguement<br>
TsarevichAleksei: it's called debate<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i know when i'm trying to convince someone of something i generally don't do it through insults<br>
TsarevichAleksei: you have to try to win people over, counter the counter arguement<br>
TsarevichAleksei: you understand what i'm saying man?<br>
ilikeinanenames: Of course, but you are simply giving little nixes without really saying anything<br>
TsarevichAleksei: calling me ignorant and stupid doesn't counter my arguement<br>
TsarevichAleksei: may i point to menelmacar<br>
TsarevichAleksei: thriving community<br>
TsarevichAleksei: cranda may not be thriving, but it's lasted over a year with few problems, it jumps up and down in activity<br>
TsarevichAleksei: slobovia is doing fine itself<br>
TsarevichAleksei: that represents the nations i'm a member of, i see no reason for any of them to become part of a giant merger nation<br>
ilikeinanenames: Menelmacar and Slobovia are hardly thriving<br>
ilikeinanenames: I think Troy can back up the fact that Slobovia is suffering<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i said slobovia is doing alright, not thriving<br>
TsarevichAleksei: menelmacar is doing wonderfully<br>
TsarevichAleksei: take a look<br>
ilikeinanenames: I am<br>
TsarevichAleksei: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar">pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
slobkaiser1: um...Slobovia's surviving, but not the way I would have wanted<br>
TsarevichAleksei: well, we can fix that<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i think the language, when released may pump some life into her and strengthen the community bonds<br>
ilikeinanenames: 70% of the posts are by Archetype!<br>
Archetype2357: Yes they are, I talk a lot.<br>
Archetype2357: And I start discussions.<br>
Archetype2357: (Just peaked back in to see that.)<br>
Thane of CATS has left the room.<br>
Archetype2357: But the last 160 ? <br>
Archetype2357: Guess what? Those aren't by me only a few are.<br>
Archetype2357: So don't act like we aren't thriving and a community.  <br>
TsarevichAleksei: i think it's perfectly normal for a national leader (or in this case perceived national leader) to make a lot of the posts<br>
Archetype2357: If your idea of thriving is lots of rambling and debates ok we're not that.  We are however a close community, passing laws, and enjoying ourselves.  What part of that isn't thriving and healthy? *shrugs* <br>
ilikeinanenames: Do you not agree a merging of ideas, ideals, cultures and systems is a healthy thing? It has never, ever been a -bad- thing, never has it hurt anything.<br>
Archetype2357: I think it wouldn't be healthy at all.<br>
ilikeinanenames: Look at the wonderful, innovative nations that sprang up after Tymaria.<br>
ilikeinanenames: Or the activity after UAS.<br>
Archetype2357: I believe merging should be done slowly, it takes a long time for some people to adjust.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: there's no reason to fix what isn't broken<br>
TsarevichAleksei: this isn't the death of micronationalism as we know it, far from it<br>
TsarevichAleksei: new blood comes and goes<br>
Archetype2357: Menelmacar is getting 3 new immigrants.. just this week.<br>
slobkaiser1: this is just a typical activity depression<br>
TsarevichAleksei: exactly<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: Because your micronations Hubert you view as dieing from activity.. not all of us are.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Archetype2357: If you would, please outline the system that would run us and so forth sometime, and share it with me in Menelmacar.  Because I'm to stoned right now to remember it tomorrow. and .. chats back to you Belci.<br>
Archetype2357: Friend just called. <br>
ilikeinanenames: Yes, but you ignore the healthy activity that merging is<br>
Archetype2357: ignore? bah<br>
Archetype2357: There is nothing to ignore.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: will do arch<br>
Archetype2357: BECAUSE I haven't seen any merging occur recently, and any activity it's generating.<br>
Archetype2357: So once you start mering, then give me that arguement.<br>
Archetype2357: merging<br>
ilikeinanenames: UAS and Tymaria<br>
Archetype2357: Don't SITE dead nations.<br>
Archetype2357: That's hardly going to convince me to join.<br>
ilikeinanenames: No, I'm citing what happened AFTERWARDS<br>
Archetype2357: &quot;Let's join so we can die again.&quot;<br>
TsarevichAleksei: that does seem to be his reasoning<br>
Archetype2357: Not my idea of a good idea.  You present a reasonable arguement and I'll definetly consider it.  However I haven't seen it yet.  Sorry.<br>
ilikeinanenames: In both cases activity sprang up and, mostly after Tymaria, new, exciting nations popped up<br>
ilikeinanenames: And older nations were REBORN and had new blood<br>
ilikeinanenames: And ideas<br>
TsarevichAleksei: and what happened to these new exciting micronations?<br>
ilikeinanenames: Well, there's Baracao<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i believe that predates tymaria<br>
ilikeinanenames: I wasn't around during Tymaria, I can't name them off hand<br>
ilikeinanenames: It doesn't<br>
TsarevichAleksei: it dates to the period of tymarian activity<br>
TsarevichAleksei: so that doesn't support your theory of collapse activity<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i think most post tymarian nations are just about the same as pre-tymarian nations, in some cases just said nations regaining their independence<br>
NoseworthyS has entered the room.<br>
Rakesh386 has entered the room.<br>
NoseworthyS: Hello folks, I hear that there is merger talk in the air?<br>
ilikeinanenames: Yea<br>
ilikeinanenames: There was chat last night too<br>
TsarevichAleksei: yes, that's what we're debating<br>
Archetype2357: I invited noseworthy and Rakesh<br>
TsarevichAleksei: cool<br>
NoseworthyS: Ok, first off, who's the ilikeinanenames dude?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: Hope you don't mind but I figured we needed more intelligent people in here.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Archetype2357: That's Hubert Nose<br>
NoseworthyS: ah ok<br>
Archetype2357: At least from the sounds of it it was..<br>
TsarevichAleksei: yep, it is<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilikeinanenames: I think the opinions of GS and Jasonian would also be important<br>
ilikeinanenames: You should all check out last nights log</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> [I read the previous log.. Scott didn't seem pro it.. ]<br>
Archetype2357: Why dont' you just give us all quick run down of this idea please? <br>
NoseworthyS: did they say something like this:<br>
TsarevichAleksei: now anyway, hubert's idea is we all merge and then die, which occording to hubertian micronational theory causes a huge jumo in activity<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NoseworthyS: &quot;MY GOD! NO MORE TYMARIAS! YOU&quot;RE ALL ON CRACK!?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Archetype2357: Somemen noseworthy.<br>
Rakesh386: wait crack is good ;-)<br>
TsarevichAleksei: interestingly, Jason is for this<br>
NoseworthyS: ok, this has to be bad, lol<br>
TsarevichAleksei: yeah<br>
Archetype2357: It sounds horrible to me so far...<br>
ilikeinanenames: Well, look at UAS<br>
TsarevichAleksei: so me and arch have been arguing against the hubertian theory<br>
ilikeinanenames: Or Tymaria<br>
TsarevichAleksei: dead nations<br>
ilikeinanenames: Afterwards...<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: So far Huberts debate has been &quot;it brings activity&quot; even if it DIES, and if you disagree insult Belci in private message.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
ilikeinanenames: Would you stop the degrading name?<br>
NoseworthyS: Tymaria was a disaster<br>
ilikeinanenames: I don't need to give the whole character spiel<br>
TsarevichAleksei: who said anything about the character spiel?<br>
Archetype2357: What is the Character spiel?<br>
TsarevichAleksei: hubert's your name isn't it, so therefore you're theory is hubert's theory<br>
NoseworthyS: you can't combine serious nations and apollo nations, and you sure as hell can't combine Shireroth with anythign &lt;- The lesson of Tymaria<br>
Archetype2357: *is uninformed...*<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TsarevichAleksei: so Hubertian Micronatinal Theory<br>
NoseworthyS: that's a book I'd like to read</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Rakesh386: same here<br>
TsarevichAleksei: lol<br>
TsarevichAleksei: ask him to write it, i wouldn't mind reading it myself<br>
Archetype2357: *would probably find that funny if he knew hubert...?*<br>
ilikeinanenames: I'm &quot;Hubert&quot;<br>
Archetype2357: All I know about Hubert is he was fickel and the stuff he read.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: nah, i think knowing this idea is enough to make it funny<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NoseworthyS: well, every culture needs their unconventional publications</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Archetype2357: Hubert I'm not stupid.. I afterall said that earlier when introducing Noseworthy.<br>
ilikeinanenames: Well what was with the comment about &quot;if I knew hubert?&quot;<br>
Archetype2357: I don't know you.<br>
ilikeinanenames: Understand if it confused me;-)<br>
Archetype2357: I may know your name, but your name obviously is not &quot;YOU&quot;<br>
ilikeinanenames: Ah, okay then<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: Glad we solved that problem.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
TsarevichAleksei: now, can we have some dramatic example of death activity?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: Hubert: Who would run the government?<br>
Rakesh386: I would ;-)<br>
TsarevichAleksei: doesn't matter, the whole point is to die</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
TsarevichAleksei: lol<br>
Rakesh386: a smart Indian is very good<br>
Archetype2357: how about a Poor brazilian boy.. I know one...<br>
Rakesh386: plus the whole American thing<br>
slobkaiser1: why can't we, instead of doing a merger, get a huge scandal going instead?<br>
Rakesh386: Indian+American == unbeatable combination<br>
Archetype2357: Honestly hubert.. all kidding aside.<br>
Archetype2357: Please explain to me how the government would be ran.<br>
ilikeinanenames: I think that that would have to be decided after we all agree on a general merger. In my opinion a basic republic with a strong executive would probably work best.<br>
Archetype2357: Slob: or we can just enjoy our nations.. like we're currently doing...<br>
TsarevichAleksei: yeah, we'll have attera try and take over the world again, that'd get activity going<br>
TsarevichAleksei: lol<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: Hubert! You kidding?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

NoseworthyS: you're thinkig Shireroth<br>
ilikeinanenames: No?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: You want us to all give up our nations and then say &quot;ok lets decide on a nation.&quot;<br>
Archetype2357: All in one big swoop?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
TsarevichAleksei: the world except for tymaria again?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilikeinanenames: No, but before we decide on the specifics lets decide the merge would generally be a good idea!<br>
Archetype2357: No man. That's ridiculous.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
ilikeinanenames: Then, of course, we get into the government.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TsarevichAleksei: i think we need the specifics to decide if it's a good idea<br>
Archetype2357: How can I decide it's  aGOOD idea if I dno't even know how it is going to be ran!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Archetype2357: For all I know you'll be dictator.<br>
Archetype2357: And that is a _BAD_ idea. <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilikeinanenames: I meant, the idea of merging, however you are correct<br>
Archetype2357: Yes I know I am, now if you could please share some specifics.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
ilikeinanenames: I haven't come up with them. Why should I alone magically decide the government?<br>
ilikeinanenames: All sides should have a say<br>
TsarevichAleksei: all sides can't agree to merge<br>
Archetype2357: Well I don't plan on letting my nation just join limbo man. I'll definetly vote no when that hits the conclave floor.<br>
ilikeinanenames: Before any votes happen we of course should agree on a governmental structure<br>
ilikeinanenames: For now, I thought we should start discussion<br>
Archetype2357: Menelmacar is thriving right now, unless you can give me a reason why to give that up to your random idea, then I can't ask others in Menelmacar to do the same, I'm sure Belci agrees.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: hey, some pretty great people were in limbo, caeser, archemedes, socrates<br>
ilikeinanenames: This idea hit me last night.<br>
Archetype2357: lol Belci<br>
TsarevichAleksei: of course it is the first level of hell...<br>
Archetype2357: In some theologies.<br>
slobkaiser1: were in hell did Nero end up?<br>
TsarevichAleksei: probably the 7th level<br>
Archetype2357: Well sorry to say it like this... and I mean no disrespect.<br>
NoseworthyS: Nero? Don't know a thing about him, but they named a free CD burning program that's great after him so he must have been good<br>
NoseworthyS: lmao<br>
TsarevichAleksei: i too was hit with the idea of merging last night<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: But this seems like a completely unorganized opinion which has been given no thought.  If you ever give it thought and organize it into a succesful plan, I'd be happy to listen to it again but right now.. it's garbage.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->TsarevichAleksei: but on a much smaller scale<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilikeinanenames: Wow Archetype</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
slobkaiser1: yeah...Belci...I noticed that<br>
TsarevichAleksei: as troy has likely been driven crazy hearing me talk about<br>
TsarevichAleksei: lol<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NoseworthyS: I too had a merger experience...it involved merging several documents into one. To say the least, it was highly successful and we're hoping for many peaceful and exciting years</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilikeinanenames: Coming from somebody like you I thought you'd appreciate my efforts to try to make a discussion on this issue democratically</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: I absolutely respect your ability to gather us here to listent o your plan.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
TsarevichAleksei: lol<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: The problem is you don't have a plan.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
ilikeinanenames: Exactly<br>
Archetype2357: You have an idea, a concept, with no concrete backing.<br>
TsarevichAleksei: well, i think Nova Germania would be a great idea<br>
ilikeinanenames: I had a basic proposal, we come up with a plan democratically<br>
Archetype2357: Well your proposal needs specifics.  If you are able to offer me specifics I'll listen.<br>
Archetype2357: You see I don't like the idea to start with so you'll need to convince me before I want to participate.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: Do you understand?  This is nothing against you, it's against a proposal which is just two words.  &quot;Lets merge&quot;.  Lets merge incites in me many emotions and thoughts but most important. &quot;no.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
TsarevichAleksei: to quote Rammstein:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: From that stand point I need convincing, if you are able to give me specifics, or a time table, or a forum that this discussion is going on.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Archetype2357: I'd be happy to continue discussion in hopes of a resolve that is best for Menelmacar.  Because I am menelmacari and I must look after my brothers in Menelmacari.<br>

TsarevichAleksei: nothing is held universally<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: My opinion is obviously held by others.<br>

Archetype2357: That is what I want Noseworthy.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: If he wants me to even consider this as a logical idea, it needs to be logical.  Not just a concept &quot;Lets merge to build activity and die like Tymria and UAS&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: Death brings a disfunctional micronation.  Let me site a few: Feinova, Pacary, need I go on?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Archetype2357: That doesn't seem as excessively active to me...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
TsarevichAleksei: or so much activity that the nation has a civil war and collapses<br>
TsarevichAleksei: neither of those things are good<br>
Archetype2357: Somemen.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rakesh386: that's a logical falacy. You don't create something for its momentary plus points, only for it to be screwed later on.

Keeping a nation alive is of course a do-it-yourself. Pointing aat others and say, &quot;hey, keep this place alive&quot; doesn't work. <br>
<br>
Something else that recently occurred to me: Micronationalism is teamwork. That means that you have to cooperate to give a good result. It also means that individual actions may not always be immediately rewarded, but  perhaps only in the long run or only indirect. <br>
<br>
Back to the merger: it may bring together a lot of people, but not necissarily a good team.<br>

The merging and bringing people together.. would just ruin new micronationalist.In Menelmacar Harvey alienated a lot of the new comers calling them my papels.  I'm afraid a merger would destroy newcomers ambitions in micronations.<br>
<br>
 I instead like Menelmacars current setting.  Governments easy to understand, newcomers can catch on quickly, and our community is in such a way that they are easily welcomed. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The allegation that this technology would create a machine to spy on others and invade people's privacy is way off the mark. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> -- Jan Walker, DARPA </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> </p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmenelmacarfrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=233.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmenelmacarfrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=233.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmenelmacarfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=233.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmenelmacarfrm23.emailToFriend?topicID=233.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmenelmacarfrm23.threadControl?topicID=233.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmenelmacarfrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=233.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmenelmacarfrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=233.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="menelmacarfrm23">Imperial Square<option value="menelmacarfrm13">The Prancing Pony Inn<option value="menelmacarfrm14">Tavern of The Mind<option value="menelmacarfrm8">Conclave Of Equals<option value="menelmacarfrm46">Conclave Archives<option value="menelmacarfrm20">Immigration<option value="menelmacarfrm32">Elfcatraz<option value="menelmacarfrm11">Prefect of Culture<option value="menelmacarfrm27">Library of Eressëa<option value="menelmacarfrm33">Story-Tellers Corner<option value="menelmacarfrm37">Roleplay<option value="menelmacarfrm39">Hurmu<option value="menelmacarfrm18">Balar<option value="menelmacarfrm17">Teir'Dal<option value="menelmacarfrm19">Haradwaith<option value="menelmacarfrm35">Yellow Territory<option value="menelmacarfrm41">The Independant Opinion<option value="menelmacarfrm43">Menelmacar Athletic Association<option value="menelmacarfrm28">Legislative Archives<option value="menelmacarfrm42">Revolution - Old forum Posts<option value="menelmacarfrm26">Passed Legislation - No longer Valid<option value="menelmacarfrm44">Signature testing<option value="menelmacarfrm45">The Grand Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar>Menelmacar</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmenelmacarfrm23>Imperial Square</a> <font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.241b<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
