It is obvious to everyone in Menelmacar that we are all individuals and able to think and post freely with or without a forum.  <br>

You group would not have formed UNLESS your group was communicating somewhere it did not require any party forum to be a party so the legislation is irrelevant that is a bad and frankly pathetic excuse to deny free thinking on grounds your groups legislation wasn't formed.<br>

Yes, but without a forum you are not letting us meet in a place to discuss our issues.<br>

Most neutral micronationalists would disagree with you. The ones I've talked to think it promotes diversity; thats just opposite to what you have said. I think many people agree that there is a group writ in water. The only way to counter a group, is through unity. Doesn't mean we are trolls. Our voting records have shown that. Problem is that some people are just not open to new ideas. We are discussing and not perforce acting in a certain way. We aren't discriminating who joins either. Despite your conservativeness in the government type of Menelmacar(not saying you are a conservative in terms of real world ideology but you are against change of government form here) you were invited to join, wern't you? <p>-Hoefensfill XXI</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Scrolls<br>

You act like posting in the square is a bad thing that it's not as good as seperate forum.  You see more people read the Imperial Square then your party forum I for one haven't looked in it once since it was created.<br>

<br>
The fact remains you area ble to communicate your ideas to each other enough to create a group.  That says communication is taking place without a forum.  You tell me why it is necessary for your party to have one? We gave you one but it is hardly necessary.  Secondly the point of having a forum is to allow us all to communicate in different time zones, and on-line posting habits.   You and your small groups habits are obviouslly close enough to allow communication between its member, if it was not I doubt you'd of been able to decide on core values, agendas, and the 'want' to form a group.<br>

Name a neutral micronation, there is no such thing.  People can pretend but their is no such thing as a neutral nation.  Secondly you are saying we don't promote diversity and that is definetly bullshit.

Archetype if I told you there is hardly any diversity in political issues in menelmacar and that can be seen mostly through the Conclave voting records you would tell me people vote how they want to and everyone agrees on most things.

Problem is people who don't really care too much about some issues(and most of the time that includes me) are sort of a convince-me vote.

The problem with the constitution is that many people who don't care as much can be convinced quickly through IM. This is mainly because we don't really have space for a debate. There is the law smith forum but rarely is it used for debating. And there might be pressure to vote in a certain way and the polls have to be secret.<br>
<br>
I don't see anything inherently wrong with the system but we have to take measures to make sure people are voting what they really want and what they really understand. <br>
<br>
Some people are more politically involved than others and these would be elected by the people and would form authorities with limited veto capabilities(ie: they can be overthrown). And even if these political measures are too radical there is the other problem.<br>
<br>
Current system has democracy, but not freedom or equality. People can be punished without a trial! This is due to the disruptive foreigners law. NO DUE PROCESS! We need a constitution that in its foundations is not only democratic but that protects every individual. Not just citizens. If we want to treat citizens better than foreigners thats kind of elitist is it not? <br>

Law smith was created for debates if people don't use it that is their choice.

That is a skill anyone who wishes to get their political agenda across should have.  I've convinced quite a few people to my side that originally opposed my ideas, that is because I attempted as best I could to give them an educated opinion.  That does not mean they are drones, it means their prior convictions where not strong enough under logical scrutiny.  People have convinced me of issues too and I appreciate their efforts as it allows me to be become more enlightened in my political views.<br>

Easy to change tunes when first proven wrong, no matter your new approach to me is equally false.  There are no neutral micronations, their are no neutral micronationalist.  Their are uninformed so do not have opinions, but they do not know the issues so are therefore not neutral.  If they knew all the facts they would have personal bias, NOBODY is without personal bias and it will take an act of congress plus DARPA brain washing to believe otherwise.<br>

Yes but you assume because we are a nation the real worlds politics affect us. We are a small nation and real world politics play little on the Micronational forum and their actions hardly play dictate ours.  While we can derive similiarities we are not large enough to require us NOT to be a direct democracy, believe as you will but we're small enough that nobody here needs any form of represenation other then their own posts.
