I no longer consider the user known as Haruka to be human, but only another machine designed to piss people off.  You might not encounter it as it is a local user on Ushi no Tane.<p>I have removed my information because I refuse to associate or communicate with it.  Those of you who want to contact me should already have my email and messenger names.  All other information has been removed because it consisted of nothing informative anyway.<p>If anyone wants to take note of it, I am perfectly capable of getting angry and/or flaming back at a person who deliberately tries to insult me.  Doing so is an entirely and HUMANLY defensive gesture, as any true person would be able to see.  <p>If you think I'm a prick, just don't bother to comment or talk to me.  Act as if I don't exist, don't respond to me, and I will in turn ignore you.  In doing so, a mutual, unstated agreement of non-hostility is achieved.  If you flame at me or in any way imply stupidity in myself or anyone I consider to be a friend, I WILL retaliate.  I as a person am secretive and defensive by nature, but I can and will go on the offensive if someone manages by some feat of bad luck to piss me off.  And after I am done flaming you and taking your character to tiny pieces, I will simply ignore you and it is possible for everything to return to the way it once was, except that I will leave you sputtering and complaining for a short time about my single angry post, which will be the last thing I will post to you.  Everyone else can enjoy my cheerful company once again, after I have read over some webcomics and/or fanfiction, watched a whole lot of anime, drawn some dragons (or gryphs, or both), and expressed the incident in a potentially disturbing and completely abstract way by causing horrible pain and suffering to a character in one of my stories, if I have one in progress.  As if I don't do that with my stories already.<p>And if you happen to catch me in a bad mood, I am a teenage girl.  That should explain it all.  Unless you're very dense, forgotten it, or haven't learned about it yet.  If that's the case, figure out yourself.  I'm not about to tell.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">None - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank"></a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 		 		<span class="privatevalue">private</span>						</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
