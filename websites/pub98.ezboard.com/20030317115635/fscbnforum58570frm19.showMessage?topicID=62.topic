Betrayal<br>

<br>
All stories have a beginning. This one just happens to begin at the end of a sharp, pointy, thick piece of oak. They say that when you make a friend, and I mean a real good friend, that he, or she, is a friend for life. Obviously whoever invented that saying never met a fucking vampire. Of course they’re not all bad. I’ve met some pretty cool licks in my life, almost as many as the bad ones I’ve met, but there’s something about immortality that really changes a person. And I know you’re saying, of course there fucking is, but if you really think about it, it just gives someone an even longer time to be tempted by everything out there that promises pleasure, wealth, power, or whatever else is in the grab-bag of life’s goodies.<br>
<br>
So this friend of mine saw something he liked, something he thought he needed, and decided to fuck over the one person who’s always supported him, never left his side, hell, even saved his fucking life once or twice. If you haven’t guessed already, that person was me. <br>
<br>
It goes down like this.<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
Rain pounded down in sheets outside. Through a crack in the small window frame on the far wall, a drop of water snaked its way down the porous stone to disappear behind Brian’s head as he rested atop a wooden box, eyes closed, waiting. We were all waiting. For what, exactly, none of us knew. At this point the chaos had reached such an unimaginable height that we were all simultaneously glad—and surprised—to be alive, and in relative safety. Truth be told, I don’t think any of us wanted to know what was in store for us. In the end, we’d know one way or the other, and the answer would find us, eventually, three stories up, above ground, out there somewhere on the streets of San Francisco, hunting us down like a patient predator.<br>
<br>
I stood there, leaning against a wall in the basement of a condemned building with fellow kindred, some younger than me, some older, but all of us neonates. And all of us scared out of our fucking minds. I spent my time—during those tortuous, endless hours of waiting—taking my pistol from my jacket pocket to wipe it down with a greasy rag, as if I could somehow make it a more effective killing tool simply by cleaning it. I looked to my fellow comrades—what remained of the resistance group that looked to me as their leader—and could almost see the strength and the hope draining out of them. And for the first time since coming to the west coast at the behest of my sire, I began to truly despair. What could we possibly hope to accomplish, a mere handful of Cainites, against a well-organized, devilishly purposed, seemingly unstoppable foe? Yet I was the source of the strength. Myself and Simon. And we could not appear to falter or it would be just as good as signing a death sentence for all of us. So I kept my chin up, my voice steady, and my words plain. But I could not help believe that my eyes betrayed me. When they looked at me, they flinched away, as if they knew that I, too, suffered from the same despair, and they did not want to come to believe it.<br>
<br>
Twelve frightened vampires. Thirteen if you counted Simon, who had not yet returned with his report. An already unlucky number to fit our unlucky situation. But was it really luck that had brought us here? We had all either chosen to come or had someone choose for us. None of us was here because of mere happenstance. We were all fighters, and I think that’s what scared us the most. How could we fight something couldn’t understand, much less defeat? One of the Camarilla’s strongest had come here by her own volition only a few nights past, and in one of the bloodiest battles in the history of our kind, had fallen quickly, like a frail stalk of wheat under and unforgiving scythe.<br>
<br>
I pushed myself off the wall, gun still in my hand, letting the cold metal lend me some comfort, and walked over to where Jordan and Mitch played a game of craps in the middle of the room. The dice bounced over the hard stone and came to rest showing a three and a four. Seven. Mitch’s eyes lit up as he scooped up the dice, but even his expression of mirth at winning was over-shadowed by his mood, which reflected our own. “You lose again,” he said to Jordan. “I guess it’s my lucky night.” He chuckled softly.<br>
<br>
Jordan’s face contorted and he scrambled to his feet, lunging at Mitch. He caught his surprised companion by the collar and spat into his face. “Fuck you,” he said, trembling with rage. Stepping in, I tore the two apart. Mitch stumbled backwards, startled. “Jesus Christ, Jordan! It’s only a fucking game!” he said, shaking.<br>
<br>
I put myself between the two of them, pushing against Jordan’s chest to get his attention. “Calm down, Jordan,” I told him. His eyes were still wild, and I didn’t want him taking this any further than it had already gone. I could feel everyone else’s eyes on both of us, but nobody else moved, or spoke. They were all waiting to see what he would do.<br>
<br>
“Fuck you!” Jordan said again, trying to shove me out of the way. I caught his arm and shoved him back, then pulled my pistol. <br>
<br>
“I said, calm the fuck down, Jordan.” I pointed the gun directly at his face. “I don’t want to deal with your shit right now.”<br>
<br>
Jordan took a look at the gun, then glanced past me at Mitch, then shook his head and kicked at the ground. “Dammit,” he muttered to no one in particular. “It doesn’t fucking matter, anyway. We’re all dead.”<br>
<br>
I lowered the gun, looking back to Mitch, who was still staring at Jordan, much like everybody else. I knew I had to do something at this point or the situation would fly out of control, and then there would be nothing left in this room but blood on the walls and ash on the floor. Nevertheless, I stood there, mute, as Jordan shuffled around, turning his back on the room. Secretly we all feared the same thing. Jordan was just the first one of us to voice it in so many words.<br>
<br>
“Well, fuck,” I finally said, taking my gun out again and tossing it to the floor. It clattered to the ground, skidding to a stop near Jordan’s foot. “What’s the point, then, huh?” I turned to regard everyone in the room. “Why don’t we just fucking end it, then? Do you all feel the same way? Are we doomed? Jordan seems to think we are. What about the fucking rest of you? Tell me! Tell me what you think!”<br>
<br>
I turned my gaze to Mitch, who stared at me for a moment, then looked away. Brian had opened his eyes, but remained sitting, wringing his hands as he stared at the floor. And everyone else, well, everyone else was struggling with their own internal demons.<br>
<br>
“Don’t any of you have anything to say?” I repeated. After a moment, Silas, the lone Toreador in our group, spoke up.<br>
<br>
“Simon’s been gone for an entire day. It’s pointless, man. He was our last chance.”<br>
<br>
For a moment, there was silence, then Jade, one of the two Gangrel I had met since coming to the city, rose up out of his crouch and spoke.<br>
<br>
“This is pathetic.” His eyes were green, from which he claimed his namesake, and like the gemstone, a deep green, and penetrating. “After all we’ve been through, after all Trevor has done for us, all of you just want to throw in the towel?”<br>
<br>
Jade walked to where Jordan stood, crouched down, and picked up my pistol. He returned it to me, clasping both hands over my own as he did so. He nodded to me, and the corners of his mouth turned up briefly into a reassuring smile. Quickly, his expression melted back to stone. He addressed the room again.<br>
<br>
“We’re fighters: all of us. We were picked for a reason, and sent here, either by our sires, our elders, or by others among us. Hell, some of us even chose to come here because we believed that we could make a difference. Do we want to throw all of that away now? San Francisco is just one city. I won’t be the first to claim that we’ve lost it, that these Eastern Kindred have surprised us with their numbers, and their powers, and their sheer tenacity, but that doesn’t mean they’ve taken everything. Cities have fallen in the past! So what?” Jade held his arms out and flung them back to his sides. “When New York fell to the Sabbat, did we stop fighting for it? Did we just pack up and relegate it to the scrap-heap of fallen domains? No, we didn’t. We bided our time, built up our resources, fought back and reclaimed it. So are we supposed to just lie down now and accept our inevitable fate?” Jade motioned to everyone in the room. “The twelve of us know more about the Cathayans just by our experiences with them than probably most of the Kindred in the world. That’s valuable information—vital, crucial information. Our lives mean more now, not just to us, but to every one of our kind who is counting on us. What right to we have to act this way?” Jade shook his head, looking back to me. “It’s your show, Trevor. We’ve all made our oaths to you. I, for one, have not forgotten my promises, and do not shed them lightly.” Jade stepped back to the corner of the room, taking up his crouching position again. I looked to him, and nodded, then to Jordan, and then to the rest of them.<br>
<br>
“We are all young,” I stated. “But over the past few years I feel that many of us have seen and experienced more than some of our elders. Conflict has aged us prematurely. And it’s hardened us. But at the same time it’s worn us down.” Acknowledgement flitted across everyone’s eyes as I said this. “I know you’re all tired, and you need to rest. I know you all want something in return for the blood you’ve shed in the name of the Camarilla. Fuck, I know I do. Ever since we came here, we’ve been looking to gain some ground, to register a success, to beat those fuckers back to the shore and send them sobbing back to China or wherever the hell they come from, but so far it’s been the other way around. They’re beating us out of our domain. They’re killing us both on the field and off. It’s natural to feel the way you do. It’s natural to want to kiss this bullshit goodbye and go back home.”<br>
<br>
Everyone had fixed their gazes on me. It was this moment that counted. Either they cared, or they didn’t, and I would be their pillar of strength. I might feel like I was crumbling, but Jade knew I couldn’t, and I knew I couldn’t, so I willed my knees from jell-o to stone and I breathed in deeply and continued. “Simon is out there. When I asked him to go scout for us, he did it willingly. He didn’t question me. He just did it. He put his trust in me, in all of us, that we would be here when he got back, and that he would be ready to fight. This is what we have to do. We have to buy our people some time so we can evacuate the rest of our assets and see our elders safely out of the city. Many of our brothers have already given up their lives for this cause. If we fail now, what purpose did their deaths serve? We’re all that’s left. And we owe it to them, and to Simon, to be strong. Saying shit like ‘we’re already dead’ only puts another card in the Cathayan’s hands to play against us. We’ve still got a role to play here, and it involves responsibility, forethought, and grit. And I’m here, asking you guys for the final time—because this is when it counts—to lay your lot in with me and make a fucking stand. So? What’ll it be?”<br>
<br>
Moments passed, silent except for the whooshing noise of the steady downpour finding its way into the building through cracks and crevices. I stood there silently, waiting for their acknowledgement, for some sign that my words had sunk in and found roots. At last, Jordan, of all people was the first to speak. He wiped a hand across his face, smearing blood from eyes that I had not seen weeping. “You know what you’re doing, Trevor. You’ve always known what you were doing.” If you only knew, I thought to myself, then maybe you wouldn’t be saying this, Jordan. But he was. And that was what counted, after all. “I’m still a fighter,” he continued, “and you’re right, it’s not over.” He stepped forward to clasp my hand, jaw set firmly, confidence radiating from his stature.<br>
<br>
Across the room, the rest of the resistance group began to echo his sentiments. Jordan and Mitch shared quiet words of apology, and Jade just crouched there, nodding, looking up at me with more respect than I felt I should receive.<br>
<br>
“Alright now,” I said, when everyone seemed to finally be content. “Any more of that and I might have puked from the corniness of it.” Quiet chuckles reverberated around the room. “Simon should be returning soon, and I want you all to be ready for it. For now, we wait. And listen.”<br>
<br>
My companions regarded me with silent acknowledgement. Relieved, I returned to my spot near the door and waited. Hours later, as the rain finally relented, I lowered myself to the cold floor and prepared to get some sleep. <br>
<br>
Rap, rap, rap. Rap, tap, rap. My eyes popped open just as I was about the close them, and I looked to the door. Six knocks, separated by a pause. Simon was back. Everyone in the room got the their feet, staring at the door. They looked to me. Rising to my feet, I took a hold of the iron latch, pushed down, and pulled the door open.<br>
<br>
There stood Simon, soaked to the bone, hand raised to knock again. Seeing me, he grinned briefly, then adopted a serious look. “Something’s come up,” he said. “I need to speak with you alone.” <br>
<br>
I nodded, turning back to look at the group. “I’ll be back in a few minutes. Don’t anybody go anywhere.”<br>
<br>
“Right,” Mitch said, and the rest of them laughed. I stepped out into the corridor and pulled the door shut behind me.<br>
<br>
“So what is it you need to tell me?“ I began to say, as I turned back to Simon. My words were interrupted as I felt a sharp pain pierce the skin of my back, driving through my torso to tear through the thin tissue surrounding my heart and then into the organ itself. I felt my arms drop and my legs crumple as all control I had over my body ceased in a single moment. I began to fall.<br>
<br>
Before I hit the ground, Simon caught me. I couldn’t see him, but I could hear him. He removed his hand from my back into which he had plunged the stake. “I came to tell you that we’ve lost.” He hoisted my body up over his shoulder and began to climb the staircase, one grueling step at a time. His voice was strained with the effort, and changed somehow. I couldn’t believe this was happening. That he was responsible. Of all people, my brood-mate—why? “They told me that if I cooperated, if I gave over the resistance to them, that they would spare you.” We climbed higher, further away from the Kindred I had pledged my life to protect, further away from a room full of scared vampires who needed me to lead them. Further away from everything. I wanted to tear the stake from chest and beat Simon’s head against the wall, beat him and his betrayal into nothing but a bloody stain, but I was helpless. The wood was buried deep, and I was going nowhere but where Simon took me.<br>
<br>
“I know you’re asking yourself ‘why?’, right about now,” Simon said. “And you’re also pretty pissed at me. Ok, really pissed. But what I’m doing for you is what needs to be done. They would have found us eventually. I made a deal with them, and I spared both of our lives in the process. Only, I knew you wouldn’t see it that way. But I’m glad it turned out the way it did.”<br>
<br>
A screech, and a groan, and the cold air hit me in the face. We were out on the street. The rain had turned into a slow drizzle that pelted me with frigid drops. Simon, goddammit! What the fuck did he think he was doing? Did he actually think these demons would keep their word? Did he actually think at all? How could he betray me his own kind like this? Betray me like this. After forty years of friendship, how could he just make such a selfish decision and be happy with it? I wanted to scream with rage, but the stake prevented me. Instead, I screamed aloud inside my mind, drowning out anything else he had left to say.<br>
<br>
Eventually, I heard a truck pull up. Simon gently lowered me to the ground. I heard the back doors of the truck opening, and a ramp sliding out. He picked me up again, and walked up the ramp into the bed of the truck. “Open it,” he said to someone. I heard something slide across something else. “Help me with him.” Another pair of hands grabbed my legs and I was lifted higher, then my legs dropped out from under me. The rest of my body fell, somewhat painfully, to the bottom of whatever I was being placed into, followed by a sharp crack and grunt as someone was thrown against the truck’s interior wall. “What the fuck are you doing?” I heard Simon yell. “That’s my friend in there!” Another painful grunt followed as Simon hit whoever it was that had careless dropped my legs. His friend? Anger flared inside me. How the fuck could he still call me his friend after this? He had gone completely fucking nuts. That was the only explanation.<br>
<br>
“Get up,” Simon ordered. “Do you at least know where you’re going?” he asked. I could only assume that the other person inside the truck assented. I heard the ramp being pulled up and back into the truck. I felt Simon’s presence hovering over me. For a few moments, he said nothing. Fury and helplessness consumed me. Stupid, dumb, fucking Simon. He’d killed us all, and he was too naïve to realize it. And there was nothing I could do to make him see this, even if I’d wanted to at this point.<br>
<br>
“So I guess this is goodbye, Trevor.” Simon said. “You know, I always knew I was more clever than you. Morgan never saw that quality in me, but then again, I don’t think she ever bothered to look. We had some good times, brother.” He put his hand on my forehead, brushing his fingers through my hair. His touch sickened me. “Good times.” Then the lid of the box containing me slammed shut. I seethed inwardly, paralyzed, as thick nails secured my prison. I heard Simon give the go ahead as he jumped out of the back of the truck. The back doors swung shut and the engine started up. Before long, the truck began to move and I was on my way. <br>
<br>
As the truck carried me through the city, I pictured the rest of the group, locked deep in a basement, waiting for Simon and I to come back in with good news. To bring them some hope. And even though it had not been my decision, I felt like I had betrayed them all. As the truck transported me to wherever I was going, I felt my heart, injured as it was, beginning to die again. And I mourned them all, because I knew that I had failed them. But most of all, I mourned Simon, because of all of us, his fate would be the worst. Once I got this stinking piece of wood out of my chest, nothing would stop me from finding him. Then I would show him what it meant to betray family. Then I would show him what it truly meant to love and to hate someone at the same time. As I lay there, helpless, I held onto that thought, that one purpose, and knew that somehow I would get my chance, if only I could survive to see it realized.<br>
