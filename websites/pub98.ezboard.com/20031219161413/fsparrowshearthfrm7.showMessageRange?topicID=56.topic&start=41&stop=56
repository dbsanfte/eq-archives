The Bible was written by men, it did not fall out of the sky, in a bonded leather edition.  Among all of the writings certain writings were picked over a period of time, not all of the books had an easy time making the cut, and it took almost 400 years to get what we call the New Testament.  The great Codex Sinaititicus had Barnabas and The Shepard as part of the New Testament, books that eventually did not make the cut.  Revelation and Hebrews were a compromise between the west and the east, the east wanted Hebrews and the west wanted Revelation.  Revelation was so late in making the cut that it is not in any of the Eastern Church's lectionaries.  The Church with the Apostolic Tradition picked the books, because as St Paul said it is the Church which is the Pillar and Bulwark of Truth.  Without the Apostolic Tradition there would have been no way to pick among the various writings.  Even the Gospels themselves preserve the Tradition of Apostolic preaching.<br>

Now He wrote His words through humans, but God wrote the Bible, they are His words.  They are not the words of men.  And we know what books were written by Him in that there is no contradiction between them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Without the Apostolic Tradition there would have been no way to pick among the various writings.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
As I said before, I believe God is fully capable of revealing to man what His word is and isn't.  This Apostolic Tradition looks like putting to much faith and trust in man.  And it makes Christianity sound too much like any other world religion.  I don't put my faith and trust in man, I put my faith and trust in an all powerful God who is fully capable of revealing Himself to us and revealing His word to us.<br>
<br>
And something to consider - the protestant movement may very well have been God's doing because He didn't like what He was seeing in catholocism.  It wouldn't be the first time that religious leaders were claiming to be doing the will and work of God when in God's eyes they weren't.  Just a possibility to consider.  Because Jesus was considered highly unorthodox by the religious leaders of His day as were the early Christians - Paul especially who was raised in their orthodox ways.  And who was it that had considered the Old Testament books to be scripture back in Jesus day?  The established Jewish religious leaders (can't remember what they were called). <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

<br>
I don't see it that way at all; denying that God works through man (which, I believe we are using the wrong term here) is denying that He works through the Body of Christ--<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>man</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, perhaps should be changed to the Church.  God works his purposes through the Church; through those who love Him.  To ascribe glory to MAN would be a fallacy, but also, I believe to deny God working <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>through</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> His body of believers, the Church, is also a fallacy.<br>

The verse does not speak to the issue, as there is no definition of what is Scripture and what is not.  Only Tradition has told us what is Scripture.  As Orthodox Scripture is part of Tradition, and the foundation, but it does not stand outside of that Tradition.<br>

<br>
I can't find the word tradition used anywhere in scripture in a positive light.  Rather, every time it's brought up, it's put into a negative concept.  Even Paul talked about how he had been raised in Judaism and was extremely zealous for his father's traditions in Galatians 1:8.<br>
<br>
Jesus made a distinct difference between traditions which are from man and commands which are from God.  I see nothing in scripture to support holding to any kind of tradition, rather, I see warnings against it.  And my guess would be because God doesn't want us putting too much faith and trust in traditions.  It is possible to be so caught up in tradition that you lose sight of the truth.  Which I only say becaue I grew up in a church full of traditions. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

This is a topic in itself.  Jeff is right, we have to define <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Scripture</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in this verse.  The New Testament was not in existence when this was spoken, and, from what I understand, the Old Testament was still being defined.<br>

<br>
For 1 Cor 11:2<br>
<br>
Teaching, NLT; Tradition, NKJV; Tradition, NASB; Tradition, RSV; Ordinances, Webster's; Deliverances, Young's; Directives, Darby's; Tradition, ASV; Tradition, HNV; Ordinances, KJV; Teachings, NIV; Tradition, NAB; Ordinances, Douay-Rheims.<br>
<br>
The word being translated is paradosis<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1) giving up, giving over<br>
a) the act of giving up<br>
b) the surrender of cities<br>
<br>
2) a giving over which is done by word of mouth or in writing, i.e. tradition by instruction, narrative, precept, etc.<br>
a) objectively, that which is delivered, the substance of a teaching<br>
b) of the body of precepts, esp. ritual, which in the opinion of the later Jews were orally delivered by Moses and orally transmitted in unbroken succession to subsequent generations, which precepts, both illustrating and expanding the written law, as they did were to be obeyed with equal reverence<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
For the passage in 2 Thess 2:15,<br>
<br>
Everything, NLT; Tradition, NKJV; Tradition, NASB; Tradition, RSV; Tradition, Webster's; Deliverances, Young's; Instructions, Darby's; Tradition, ASV; Tradition, HNV; Tradtion, KJV; Teachings, NIV; Tradition, NAB; Tradition, Douay-Rheims.<br>
<br>
It was also the same word being translated - paradosis.<br>
<br>
The majority of translations seem to lean towards tradition.  However, it's relatively apparent that the concpet of tradition is not portrayed negatively every time in the Bible. <br>

Ironically, I rarely use any of those three translations, unless I don't have access to my Bibles and I'm using Blue Letter Bible online.<br>
<br>
The three I use the most are the NLT - but just for reading, it really isn't suited for study.  The NJB (New Jerusalem), kind of a Catholic NIV - modern translation, but a Catholic Bible.  Finally, I mainly use the NRSV Study Bible which includes all the books of both Catholic and Orthodox canons.<br>
<br>
And yes, no Rancor allowed here.  Very nasty to have around.<br>
