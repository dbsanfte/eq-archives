<br>
The Saracen minstrel coughed and nodded his head. “You have to forgive me,” he said as the tall Avalonian straightened his robe. “You are so serious all the time. So this is just really humorous to me,” Nitle chuckled. <br>
<br>
“Okay. I have changed my mind,” the sorcerer said as he turned to walk away. Nitle frowned and went after the caster. <br>
<br>
“Come on, Jess. I’m sorry. Come on. I won’t laugh any more.” Looking into his eyes the minstrel pleaded, “I promise.” Jess Amante looked down at the minstrel seeing his sincerity. As if to sign his verbal contract, Nitle crossed his heart. <br>
<br>
“Very well. Let’s go then.” Jess then lead the way through the housing district in Camelot. After walking for quiet a few minutes, Jess pulled up to a cottage along one of the water ways. Hiding behind a tree, both Jess and Nitle could make out the silhouette of someone within tidying it up. Jess was sweating a bit. His hands were shaky. <br>
<br>
Nitle reached out and grabbed his hand, “It will be alright. She will love it.” Giving his fashionable smile, Nitle pulled out his lute. “Oh, yes, I almost forgot.” Nitle reached inside of his pack and handled a wrapped bundle to Jess. <br>
<br>
Jess took a deep breathe. The moon was shining high down on the little cottage. A bright moonbeam was shining down in the center of the modest garden. “Okay, let’s do this.” Before stepping out of the darkness, Jess picked up a few small stones and then moved under the light of the moon. <br>
<br>
He smoothed back his long blonde hair and breathed in deeply. Then before he lost his courage he threw a single stone at the wooden shutter. He could see the silhouette inside had not stirred at all, so he threw another totally missing the window but hitting the roof. <br>
<br>
As he raised his hand back to throw another stone, Nitle out of view started playing a few lovely notes on his lute. Jess could see the resident turn towards the beautiful music and walking towards the window. Jess felt like he had stood there for hours as she approached the shutter to open it. He looked to Nitle who only smiled and nodded to him as he kept rhythm of the song. <br>
<br>
The window opened and the light from inside glowed out. Jess lost his breath as he saw the beautiful friar look out from inside. Her stunning hair shined as she peered to see where the noise was coming from. Seeing the sorcerer, her face turned to puzzlement as she said, “Jess?” <br>
<br>
Closing his eyes, Jesstr began to sing. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want be the one who hurts you <br>
I don't want to be the one who fails <br>
I'm keeping my head on straight <br>
So you can trust me again&quot;<br>
<br>
Alesa blushed seeing her husband singing to her. Her long and limber fingers covered her the sweet grin on her face. <br>
<br>
&quot;I struggled all my life with empty moments <br>
The shadow of a hole I'd never fill <br>
Any happiness I had was empty <br>
It wasn't good enough, I wanted love&quot;<br>
<br>
At the chorus of the song, Nitle joined in with Jesstr supplying a pleasant harmony. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm keeping my head on straight <br>
So you can trust me again <br>
I'm keeping my head on straight <br>
So you can trust me again&quot;<br>
<br>
Water began to fill Alesa’s eyes. As Jess continued on with the verse. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to think of life without you <br>
I don't want to take a step alone <br>
It scares me to think I almost lost you <br>
Just let me know you're fine, I'm on the line <br>
I'm thinking of our whole life baby <br>
Won't you help me find a way <br>
I'm thinking of our whole life baby <br>
Won't you help me find my way....&quot;<br>
<br>
Jess opened his eyes to see the tears streaming down Alesa’s face. He could hear Nitle in the background continuing the song as Jess approached his lovely wife. As he grew closer she opened up her arms and embraced her husband. “I love you, Jess” she whispered. <br>
<br>
“I love you, sweetie.” They held each other for awhile. Then Jess let go, awkwardly handing her a small rose. Alesa looked at the beautiful flower and smiled with the joy of it’s significance. “Come outside.” Alesa slowly and carefully crawled out through the window. Jess assisted her as best as he could and then held her in his arms as they slowly danced to the music. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'm keeping my head on straight <br>
So you can trust me again <br>
I'm keeping my head on straight <br>
So you can trust me again <br>
You can trust me again <br>
Trust me again<br>
<br>
Nitle smiled and sniffed back his own tears as he watched the two lovers find comfort in each others embrace. He played the song for awhile before he faded the music out and made his way home. <br>
<br>
<br>
Alesa and Jesstr Forever!!! <br>
<br>
<br>
OOC: The song is from Tonic - Head on Straight. I hope you enjoy it, D. <br>
