He just had that effect on her...her mind went entirely blank of all pain and sorrow for a brief moment as she returned the kiss with fervor, wrapping her arms around his neck lovingly.  Her throat quivered with sobs, but they could not escape.<br>
<br>
Azalea watched quietly, smiling sadly.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She does not need me now,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>They have each other now...and in the meantime, I've grown unwise and dull.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  &quot;I...should return to Xir Mashak to renew my training...to have counsel with Octana Sai.  But first...I must tell Garion what has happened.  He should know.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that, she disappeared, leaving them alone.<br>
<br>
Laurena pulled away gently, hearing Azalea's words, and looked hurt when she disappeared, though she never left Aeli's embrace.  &quot;She's angry with me now, I guess,&quot;  she said softly.  &quot;I should not have been so harsh with her.  It's just...she lied to me all this time, and I...I trusted her...&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes traveled from where Azalea had stood to where the bodies of her parents on the ground lay.  The sight sent a horrible shiver through her body.<br>
<br>
&quot;I remember now...&quot;  Laurena whispered.  &quot;I...can remember everything now.  This village...it wasn't the only one.  I remember seeing the entire coast in flames...The Night Of A Thousand Screams...&quot;  She didn't cry, but looked on in shocked silence.  &quot;What did my people ever do to deserve this?  And...why me?

Why did he have two souls in the first place? That was something he still didn't know... And why couldn't he remember anything besides destroying? Past that day on the beach, he remembered nothing but killing...  So much death, caused by him. Was he ever normal? Kelin's memories beyond his awakening were naught but a void of blackness.

<br>
She stoo there in his arms, before shivering again.  &quot;Can we leave...please?  I...just need to get something.&quot;  She pulled gently away and walked back within her house, and came out again, holding a bloody fishknife which her father had used to protect them so many years ago.<br>
<br>
&quot;There,&quot;  she said, ripping cloth off of the hem of her dress and wrapped it around the knife.  Then, she took Aeli's hand.  &quot;You shouldn't have to be here, Aeli.  Let's go.&quot;  Her eyes on the ground, she led him solemnly out of the village.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where do we go now...?&quot;  Laurena asked softly, once well out of range of the dead village.  &quot;I would rather not go back to New Ostona.  It would be too much to explain.&quot;  Her hair blew gently in her eyes as they walked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarialunai>Saria Lunai</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://daydream.hardwarezone.com/hina/icon004.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(8/22/03 6:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=209>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: aww, poor Laurena...</span><hr size=1> Aeli smiled and nodded slowly, happier beyond expression that he had his Laurena back. &quot;Well, we should head south then?&quot; He wondered, looking towards Laurena.

Fina stared a moment, along with a very confused Leon. &quot;He smiled... and he spoke...&quot; The redhead finally laughed, grinning at Aeli. &quot;Laurena, you must be one special young woman to be able to make Aeli do both.&quot; She bowed, and came up, still grinning. &quot;Fina Faktain, at your service.

<br>
&quot;Here we go... Fina stop showing off.&quot; Leon grumbled, rolling his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh you hush! You're just jealous.&quot; Fina glared at her brother.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not!&quot; The chestnut haired man glared as fiercly back towards his sister. &quot;Laurena and Aeli are a perfect couple! I'm not jealous at all!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, i'm saying... you're jealous he got a girl before you got one.&quot; <br>
<br>
And so the two bickered, and Aeli shook his head. &quot;Meet the Faktain siblings...&quot; He murmured.<br>

&quot;Aeli!! You're eyes are different.&quot; Talon pointed out the obvious, which apparently the two siblings had be so ignorant as not to have noticed. Both of them turned from their argument and looked towards Aeli, blinking. <br>

&quot;What?&quot; Fina's eyes widened. Last time she'd seen his eyes red.... Well, she preferred not to think about it. &quot;I... don't get it.&quot;<br>

Suddenly she froze.  Behind her stood Tryphaena, scowling, bleeding from her chest and skull.  Her skin was a pallid brown and her eyes were dead but livid.  But when she blinked, she was gone.<br>

She shook her head of the horrible image.  &quot;Were you all right?&quot;  She asked Fina. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left
