<br>
I don't claim to speak with any authority on the subject of religion.  These questions I ask are because I am sincerely curious about the answer.  You will have to forgive me.  My parents raised me away from religion; therfore, I am sure that I do not have the correct &quot;lingo&quot; down.<br>
<br>
I also don't claim to speak with an authority on the subject of anthropology or sociology.  I am hoping that the more educated, articulate, and eloquent members of this board can help me out.  <br>
<br>
With everything that I know about history, society, and culture, I am come to the conclusion that religion is a construction of man for a specific purpose:  call it control, call it keeping anarchy at bay.  I believe that religion was created to keep us more human than animal (if that makes any sense)  Religion gives us rules. <br>
<br>
Because of what I have been reading on these boards, I have come to believe that it is a born-again Christian belief that you can be &quot;saved&quot; and have a spot in heaven no matter what you do on earth, no matter what atrocities you commit, because you have accepted Christ.  If this is true, than my &quot;hypothesis&quot; that religion is a way to keep us more human than animal is incorrect.  Furthermore, I fear that beliefs like these can give people free reign to commit horrible crimes against humanity (ie, murder, rape, genocide, molestation, and just plain rudeness to your fellow man and woman). <br>
<br>
Another thought...the phrase &quot;born-again&quot; in my mind connotes the idea that &quot;unchristian&quot; behavior preceded the &quot;renaissance.&quot;  Question:  Could this belief be an easy way for &quot;unchristian&quot; behavior (past and/or present) to be easily shrugged off.<br>

But, I also think it's what one does with it and what they are really like.<br>
<br>
I wasn't raised with religion either. Never went to church as a kid, though my dad was raised Catholic.<br>
<br>
I found religion at 18. It suits me and I don't feel that it changed me really, well, not my personality I mean. It gave me peace and answers, etc. But I am still who I am.<br>
<br>
I have only heard this &quot;saved&quot; stuff from Born-Again Christians. I know why they are called that, but aren't all Christians born again at some point? The idea of my baptism was to start fresh, make a commitment, etc. Part of immersion baptism's symbolism is when you rise out of the water, it's like being born I guess.<br>
Being &quot;saved&quot; and then thinking that you've got a free ticket &quot;in&quot; makes no sense to me and I'll never understand it. In our church, we try to do the right things and be good people. In the end, we hope that we gain eternal life and eternal families.<br>
I believe that I have been baptized and married by the proper priesthood authority on earth today, but I would would never be so balsy as to assume I'm in and someone else is going to hell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I just don't get that.<br>

While I hesitate to stick up for born agains or fundies, I don't think this is an accurate description at all of what these people believe. Forgiveness is not a license to sin without regret or pause nor is the afterlife, though it sure makes it easier for most of us it seems.<br>

I don't think xian fundamentalism leads to these crimes any more than regular xianity and this is supported by the facts. Indeed, only Lutherans have a lower divorce rate than atheists according to the Barna study recently done (he's a xian btw) and we are practically absent from jails. We do not rape, kill, rob, molest or destroy property in nearly the numbers (or percentages of our own population) as xians do. Your realization then that religion is not a very good way to promote better behavior is correct, but it IS a good way to control folks if used properly. Sometimes this means getting large numbers to gather for services, perform strange rituals or even vote a certain way....unfortunately it also means Jonestown, Nazi Germany and Vatican protected child molestation rings. <br>
<br>
<br>
Religion may or may not cause bad behavior, but it SURE doesn't stop it.<br>
<br>
ST <p>&quot;I don't have any evidence of that... Just in terms of allocation of time resources, <br>
religion is not very efficient.  There's alot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.&quot; <br>

<br>
As far as born-agains, from most that I have known, the common belief is that if you have accepted Christ, you will naturally want to be like him and follow him and do good but that it isn't required to be &quot;saved.&quot;  I don't understand not being accountable for your choices. Whether that accountability comes in the form of repentance, which leads to forgiveness, or otherwise, I still see that we have to take responsibility for our own actions. I believe, like the ba's that Christ suffered for my sins but I also believe that I have to repent (be accountable when I do something I know is wrong) and I have to be constantly trying to make myself better. <br>
<br>
I was baptized in the LDS church when I was 8 but my family didn't really attend when I was young. I didn't REALLY learn about the LDS religion until I was about 21, in college, and after much searching for myself, my beliefs, etc. After that, I realized that there was nothing that was taught (imo, anyway) in the LDS church that was harmful to me and that if, indeed, Christ did what people say he did for me, then how can that be a bad thing? But then our religion doesn't have the rigid, saved or damned ideology. I don't believe that just because someone is baptized at 8 or 10 or 20 that they are necissarily converted to their religion. That comes later when you have less doubts than you do confidence. Does that make sense?<br>
<br>
Now, to this...<br>

<br>
&quot;After that, I realized that there was nothing that was taught (imo, anyway) in the LDS church that was harmful to me and that if, indeed, Christ did what people say he did for me, then how can that be a bad thing?&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know much about the LDS church, BUT I do have alot of problems with things taught from the cradle in other churches. I've a cousin who was raised from childhood to be wife,mother,servent to her future husband. She is a bright young woman, who should have gone to college but was discouraged by her family to do so. <br>
<br>
It churns my stomache to hear of other women teaching their daughters they are to submit to their husbands. I find it a frightening prospect. I know they don't mean husbands who beat or abuse their spouses, BUT if all your life you have been told you are to submit...well, you might be likely to do it, kwim? Its dangerous.<br>
<br>
And then there is the teachings going on in my ILs church. Very racial, imo, and rather hate filled. <br>
<br>
Those teachings I DO find to be harmful for a child to be raised up in. <br>
<br>
Often times you will find christians who are raised in it so deeply that they don't question it, it would never occur to them to question. Those are the people I was talking about, the braindead ones. Plus the born-agains who listen solely to preachermen and follow their interpretations of the bible without question. <br>

I've been thinking about this a lot lately. Help me think this through. Am I off track? What is missing from my understanding of all this? The way I understand it, the theory requires belief in the following premises:<br>
<br>
1. God is all loving, all knowing and all powerful<br>
2. God created us (in his image)<br>
3. God created the law (which is perfect)<br>
4. God gave us free will so we have a choice whether to love him, follow his law etc. because what fun would it be if we were &quot;automatons.&quot;<br>
5a. We need to meet a standard of &quot;perfection&quot; in order to be with god.<br>
5b. Failing to meet that standard means we get cast into a lake of fire for all eternity.<br>
<br>
Am I right on the theory so far?<br>
Here is where it loses me completely:<br>
<br>
&quot;All have sinned and fall short of the law&quot;<br>
<br>
6a. In other words, we can never meet god's standard of perfection on our own because...<br>
<br>
6b. God made us SO WEAK/FLAWED that we can never succeed in following his laws or meeting his standard of perfection - so we require interventive salvation through Christ's death.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
6c. God made the laws SO DIFFICULT that no matter how we try we cannot succeed in following them all or meeting his standard of perfection - so we require interventive salvation through Christ's death.<br>
<br>
QUESTION 1: If God is all loving, all knowing and all powerful, why didn't he make his laws easier to follow or make us less flawed? Even if I believe I HAVE followed all of his laws - then I have just committed the sin of PRIDE and am still fall short of his ideal. It's a no-win setup.<br>
<br>
Enter Christ. All you have to do is believe that some 2000 years ago, Jesus was born of a virgin, preached love and forgiveness and scolded some pharisees, never sinned, was crucified, died and rose from the dead three days later, then disappeared from the face of the earth and is sitting at god's right hand, and in fact IS god as part of the trinity of HF+HS+JC. And if you just BELIEVE this, your past and future sins will be forgiven by god and you can be with god, plus you get eternal life in heaven instead of the lake of fire. Oh, and all this is &quot;god's perfect plan for salvation.&quot;<br>
<br>
QUESTION 2: What is perfect about this plan which is-<br>
a. difficult to believe<br>
b. has an innocent punished for our &quot;sins&quot;<br>
c. assumes typical human behavior is sinful and abhorrent to the perfect god who created is his image<br>
d. assumes that no matter how good we try to be, we will never be satisfactory to god without also believing &quot;Christ died for our sins.&quot;<br>
<br>
And now, a little analogy:<br>
<br>
The bank calls and tells me that by their standards, I've made accounting errors and now owe them 12 billion dollars. And I can't possibly pay that much back, so they will throw me in a lake of fire. Forever.<br>
<br>
But, the bank generously offers me a solution too. I won't have to pay it back, or get thrown in the lake of fire, if I will just believe that they had their key accountant, who never made any errors, killed to make up for MY accounting errors and the errors of all other bank patrons. Plus, if I just believe all this and make an effort to improve my math skills, the bank president will personally escort me to a big party he has that goes on forever... <br>
<br>
WHAT IF I tell the bank I don't believe I've made such grave errors, that it's their accounting methods that are the problem, that I don't owe them a red cent, that I don't think they even have a lake of fire OR a big party going on, and that killing the best accountant they had was no way to rectify anyone elses accounting errors? <br>
<br>
That is what being an atheist means to me. I reject the notion that I am inherently sinful and awful and unworthy. Am I perfect? No. But neither have I done anything so awful that another person should die to make up for it. <br>
<br>
There seems to be a dichotomy in Christianity that says 1. You're hopelessly sinful, but 2. God just LOVES you so much that he died for you anyway. I just can't get my mind around it.<br>

There are a number of scientists who think so--it's called a meme. At one time in our evolution the belief in supernatural forces and the comfort and certainty it would have provided to a primitive people was perhaps an advantage in coping. This may actually be a good time to start a thread on just this.<br>

This is, I think, also another area where the LDS branch (we don't believe in the trinity as other Christians do either, but that is beside the point) off is that we believe that mankind is judged by it's knowledge. In otherwords, if I hadn't been taught and didn't have a belief that it was bad to lie, then I wouldn't be held accountable for doing something wrong. Does that make sense? We are taught that God knows our heart. He knows what we believe and what we feel. For me, I believe lying is wrong so for me to lie would be doing something I &quot;knew&quot; was wrong.  The more knowledge we obtain, the more accountable we become. Unlike current legal systems, if you are unaware of a law, you aren't held accountable for breaking that law. Of course, I could use the excuse that I never believed it was wrong to lie but God would know differently. <br>
<br>
Does that make sense? I don't know if that makes any difference. We don't believe that you have to believe and accept Christ or you are condemned to Hell. We believe that we are judged by our knowledge. That way, if our beliefs turn out to be true, I would be held much more accountable for my actions than you would, not believing in the same things I do. <br>
<br>
You know, as much as you all can't get your mind around there being any of this, I can't get my mind around just dying and being gone.... no where to go, nothing to do, all the feelings and thoughts that I have just gone. It seems too weird to me to think that I am capable of doing and thinking and learning so many things but that someone could hit me with their car and it would all be gone. Maybe I need to believe that I am more than just that.... that we are all more than just that. I look at my kids and I see how great they are and how they had little things that made them THEM from the time they were little. I have a hard time believing that those little personalities which emerge so quickly weren't already a part of them before their little body was created inside my womb. I can't get my mind around that!<br>

Have you ever known anyone who sustained a head blow, was in a coma, and woke up with an entirely changed personality? I have known 2 people this happened to. Knew them before, knew them after and their personalities were remarkable changed. Everybody they knew thought so, THEY even thought so. <br>
<br>
How can this possibly be if the personality is all about an eternal soul? <br>
<br>
Likewise, that theory doesn't allow for Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) which, although deemed a demon possession by some fundamentalists, is really bonafide mental disorder. Would this mean multiple souls crowded into a body?

Besides the developmental things that seem to be genetic (a propensity for intelligence or even to be alcoholic), there seem to be personality traits that are genetic. Of course, environment is key to developing or wasting these or even supressing them, but most modern pediatricians would agree there's science behind those little personalities you see....even trends among certain ethnic groups, like the more reserved asian babies. There's lots of research I'd love to share, but it's all hardcopy. I'm sure the net has a healthy amount.<br>

Salvation theory and Personal thoughts</span><hr size=1> The idea of being born again and then going and doing whatever you want because you are saved is ridiculous. If you are born again, then your view of life and your responsibilities in it are different than before, not perfect, but different. Thus, your actions should be different. Someone who is born again and is not changed from their old ways to some extent is not really born again. The difference is like this, Satan believes in God- he knows God exists, he rejects God's authority, etc. Yet he rejects God totally. (I have some serious reservations about the existence of Satan, however I think this example illuminates this issue.) Shouldn't a real Christian act more like a Christian and less evil?<br>
<br>
Does this mean that Christians are perfect? Of course not. Christians are some of the most flawed people there are. As such they should be the least likely to point at others. Living by example would be a much more powerful way to convey the message as well as closer to the message they say they believe. They should know better than to spend their time correcting others and focus on their own short-comings.<br>
<br>
***<br>
Which brings me to DL's questions. I am OK with 1 and 2.<br>
I think you go astray on number 3. <br>
3. God created the law (which is perfect)<br>
<br>
I do not think that the law or people are perfect or are required to be perfect. I think God is interested in our earnest interest in him much as we are interested in our children loving, respecting and paying attention to us. The Law, all 612 or 614 ??? of them, Jesus even said was too heavy a burden for anyone to carry. The Pharasees laid them on the backs of the people, but did not obey them themselves. Sound like anyone we know today...See paragraph one. So, if the law was an attempt to put us right with God and the people strayed from worshiping and respecting God, and those that tried were oppressed by the religious authorities through misuse of the law, then there would be need for a new plan. God would not go through the trouble except out of love. (unless he is a mad scientist...you are my creation, you will obey and love me, ha ha<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
***<br>
5a. We need to meet a standard of &quot;perfection&quot; in order to be with god.<br>
5b. Failing to meet that standard means we get cast into a lake of fire for all eternity.<br>
<br>
<br>
The New Testament or New Covenant was needed because the people had turned away from the old. I do not think perfection in the law or people is required for salvation or understanding. We love our children yet perfection in them, ourselves, or our rules does not dominate the equation. I would gladly trade my life to keep my children/family safe. God has this kind of relationship with us. At least Jesus used this kind of language over and over again in His examples of what God and Heaven are like. Look at the story of the Prodigal Son. Jesus was not saying do this and that or go to hell. He was showing the love of a father for his son. Imagine that father's saddness over how long it took the son to realize his place in the world. The father never condemned the son though, he even gave the son his share of the inheritence and waited in hope for him to return. The heart of this is love, forgiveness and joy, certainly not standards of perfection.<br>
<br>
***<br>
6a. In other words, we can never meet god's standard of perfection on our own because...<br>
<br>
6b. God made us SO WEAK/FLAWED that we can never succeed in following his laws or meeting his standard of perfection - so we require interventive salvation through Christ's death.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
6c. God made the laws SO DIFFICULT that no matter how we try we cannot succeed in following them all or meeting his standard of perfection - so we require interventive salvation through Christ's death.<br>
<br>
I have a couple of thoughts here.<br>
1.-----One possiblility is that at that time sacrifices were made to God, (real sacrifices, i.e. something that was valuable to you, your best lamb). God knew what a sacrifice it was for you do do this, just as today he knows the love you hold for others or the torment held within your heart. In this context a sacrifice of one for all, once for forever makes more sense. <br>
<br>
I do think there are many things about being a Christian that are made difficult by the cultural differences between then and now, as well as the mistakes in church doctrine made over the centuries. Some questions simply cannot be known so it is best to say nothing and not have a position on these things, such as the whole reverence of Mary thing as well as how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. (I didn't know angels made a habit of dancing on pin heads, let alone partying<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
DL says at the end of the post:<br>
There seems to be a dichotomy in Christianity that says 1. You're hopelessly sinful, but 2. God just LOVES you so much that he died for you anyway. I just can't get my mind around it.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the focus should be on the resurrection and our relationship with God. If the historical Jesus was a guy who died, then great guy, but so what? If he was a guy who was resurrected, then we are on to something. What would be the point of the resurrection? Could it be showing the way. How many times do we show our children the potty before they &quot;get it&quot; and can use it on their own. (Not exactly reverent, but it was the example that popped into my head.)<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
 <br>
2.-----I just read &quot;Rescuing Christianity from the Christians&quot; and among its many fascinating and challenging ideas is the notion that Christ was wrong about the imminent arrival of the Kingdom of God. If he was wrong about this, yet was resurrected, what are the implications of this. Was this another attempt by God to communicate with us that was subsequently distorted and misinterpreted? I have long believed that we are no better human beings now that our ancestors of centuries ago. Just look at the 20th century. <br>
<br>
I think there is more here than we realize and as with many valuable gifts we appreciate them less and underestimate their value if they are just handed to us. A few thoughts from a recent drive home---<br>
<br>
<br>
The universe is mostly empty space. The matter in it is widely dispersed. In the coldest of the cold places and the hottest of the hot and farthest of the far, and beyond, there would seem to be nothing to indicate the existence of life, let alone, a divine being. Even in our own solar system the possibility of the existence of life is rare, Earth only, and I've forgotten, but given slightly greater or slightly lesser distance to or from the sun and life would not exist even here. That life exists here in this precarious sphere, that the teeming variety finds most nooks and crannies is miraculous, not necessarily in the sense that a creator must have done this, but simply from the amazing complexity and evolutionary novelty that we know exists. <br>
<br>
My faith in God, that there is a God, is simply that, faith. I have no scientific proof, no special knowledge, and no unusual source. I only have my mind with which to concieve. (Which begs the question, do I project a ficticious God onto the universe? But I will stay on track with my thoughts driving home.) However, in the vast void of space for me to love my wife as I do, to have the capacity to love my children so deeply and to be loved by them is a thing apart from the physical reality of cold and heat and distance. It is something that exists as much as the cold, heat, or distance. That I have the capacity to love and appreciate love speaks volumes to me about the possibility of a Creator. How???<br>
<br>
Again, the Bible is not proof, nor is nature, or anything else I could point to. However, on the drive home it occured to me that a possibility exists that love is in contrast to the impersonal nature of the universe. For love to even exist, to me implies that a greater love can exist and if it does, then I want to be a part of it. What do you think?<br>

I cannot see into the heart of another. I was trying to get at the notion that being saved is not an entitlement or free ticket to go and do whatever you want. I think your responsibility as a believer is greater because of your professed belief. The fact that some of us find it harder than others to keep from sinning is up to God to sort out, certainly not me.<br>

Thanks for helping me clarify this.<br>
