Well I just got back from guiding today. I had a great guy named Kenneth in my boat as the guest. Today was his first day to fly fish. We struggled a little this morning but this afternoon he found his stride. He wound up landing several rainbows, a brown, and a cutthroat. I tried to tell him how pleased I was with him landing all three species his first day. After it was all over he and I went down to the river and he was casting with a double haul. Talk about a full day on the river.<br>
<br>
John Gulley (Orvis Guide of the Year) was the celebrity in my boat. John donated several items, flies, a guide trip, and later sold his Terrera (or whatever you call those things beauty queens wear on their heads) and raised another $75. John did a great job raising some money for the kids. Yesterday Jimmy T and I floated the river and found some really good fish. We were a boat load of failures in the big fish department. Gulley and I both cast at the &quot;pod&quot; of monsters with no positive results. There were probably 20 boats that had already drifed across them from the fly fishing &quot;aramada&quot; that floated down in front of us. Of course the 10 weight shooting head slapping the water probably didn't help us too much either. Those are just some tough fish.....<br>
<br>
We had a blast. Lori Ann Murphy soaked us with a water gun and I ran over Rebecca's fly line (like a dork). Mel Kreiger sold his personal fly rod for the cause. Duane Hada jumped out of the boat to unwrap a 24&quot; brown and then broke his rod while fishing it through a sunken stump wad. Duane wound up landing the fish with a broken rod (well done). Jack and Sandy Dennis and I had a great time today as well. It was great to see them again after spending a month in Spain with the both of them. Lots of celebs and fly fishing usuals. The usual tight lipped gruff guides were all very fun to hang out with. We had a great time and I hear that they actually exceeded their goal for the fund raising. Great job by all involved.<br>

It can be tough fishing behind a bunch of boats...Was hoping that your boat would've pulled at least something from that Pod.

I had Duane Hada in my boat with Tommy from Missippi what a great guy.  By the way, the Rod that Duane broke going after that 24&quot; Brown was My &quot;Scott Eclipse&quot; 6 wt.  I wish we had a video of that episode it was a classic in its self. I had located alot of fish for Duane. I gave him one of my Bunny Sculpins after lunch and we methodiaclly SLAYED them! What a day. what a great fisherman.  You should of seen the Rainbow we had on before the Brown it was the biggest Rainbow I have seen lately. He fought for about 8 minutes and then rolled and got off.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It was good meeting you the other night.  Actually Tommy the ametuer was in the back of the boat, and yes he couldn't beleive it.  He said that that was the funniest and greatest fishing trip has had been on in a long time.  He said he got his monies worth!<br>

We were drifting just ahead of Steve and my guys couldn't believe it when we saw Duane in the water. Made the comment he was trying to show up Jose Wejebe and his swimming for a tarpon. The fishing was tougher than normal with all the boats, but I think everyone had a good time. Might have been better if we could convince all the guides to use drift boats. I think the guys in the drift boats all had better opportunities for fish, but I am just predjudiced. The guys in my boat both made the comment on how much better the fish were in the Catch and Release area and why there isn't more of it. Met some really awesome people. Was very impressed with the out of town celebs, especially Rick Ruoff and Lori-Ann Murphy. Of course they were the ones I talked to the most, but all seemed so nice. Wish I could have talked to Jack Dennis more. The event went off very well for a first year thing. Only think it will be even better next year. I am already looking forward to it. <br>

She was with Rebecca from Cane Island and a lady from the Memphis fly fishers. I ran over Rebecca's fly line while Gully and Lori Ann were squirting each other with water guns. Thank goodness I shut the motor off when I saw the fly line and didn't ruin it. At least I got her fly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have to go with Drifter on his comments on drift boats on this one. Although it was nice to be able to run back up to a good riffel and drift it several times. We started out by running up stream and taking a try at a 20lb fish above the Cotter Bridge. We were fairly unobstructed there but never really got a good shot at that fish. By the time we made it to Round House Shoal there had been 20 boats that had drifted across those fish. We never got any interest from those fish at all. Of course I could see those fish from the front of the boat and Gully was casting a shooting head while standing on the back of the boat. I'm pretty sure we got to close to those fish for them to be very interested in taking a fly.<br>

The most interesting catch dosn't go to Duane it actually goes to Lori Ann Murphy. She caught a brown bat at Rim Shoal that measured about 5 inches. Good thing she used a barbless hook. When I pulled the hook out of the bat she looked at me like I was the kid in grade school that ate worms. I guess I had &quot;bat cooties&quot; after touching the thing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Actually I think the bat caught her. She was false casting and suddenly the fly felt a little heavy. I performed a little surgery during lunch trying to seperate the bat from the fly. I don't think the poor little guy made it though. She was pretty much &quot;icked out&quot; by the whole ordeal though.<br>
