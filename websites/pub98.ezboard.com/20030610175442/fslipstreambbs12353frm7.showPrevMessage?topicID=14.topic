<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#FFDEAD;font-family:comic sans ms;">Welllll... I really liked the ep, so it will come as no surprise that I disagree with some of this.

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#FFDEAD;font-family:comic sans ms;">You know, everytime I watched this ep, I missed the opening quote. Now I'm glad I did. Nuff said.

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#FFDEAD;font-family:comic sans ms;">Its a tough call, but we do need to remember that the Gene-ite definition of Intelligent Sci-fi is more toward the intelligence than it is toward the science... even though science is of course a part of what we want to see. So saying - I thought this was an intelligently told story. I, like Cardie in her excellent review - had been spoiled on the surprise mystery of who shot Sid. But I found everything else to be engaging and really appreciated how tightly focused the story was on THE REAL STORY! Gone are the BAMSR/IHNAT days when a Beka story turns into a Dylan story. This story was a Beka story throughout, and while Dylan had a really central role in the story - ZackAsh managed to pull off telling two whole stories in one episode. I'm reminded of the genious that was USV - we know these guys are talented with pulling together stories A, B and even C into one cohesive tale that advances all the players - and they succeed in this goal again.<br>
<br>
Indeed, given what we know the show has become - namely, Dylancentric - I'm hoping that ZackAsh teach workshops on their technique - in order for other characters to really have their chance to shine - this talent of telling two stories at once, and making them one is going to be crucial.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

 Since there really isn't a category for it I may as well put it here... what has happened to the ship? Last season it looked so much better. Has all of that battle damage finally caught up with Andromeda? Most likely not since the ship doesn't have burn marks or patch marks, it's just an ugly grey.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#FFDEAD;font-family:comic sans ms;">And to the contrary - I really liked those shots! Yes, it is a beautiful ship, but somehow the ship looked a bit more scrappy and heavy in these shots - and for some reason, that seems more realistic to me. <br>
<br>
Nox runs down all of the technical guffaws with the show - I won't do it here, but after such glowing comments, I needed to justify such a low rating in this category - I give the ep 13 of 20 points. </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

2. Complex heros and villains.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#FFDEAD;font-family:comic sans ms;">Dead on! I loved the complexity of the characterizations here...and I really loved the Uncle Sid dynamic more than I want to say in this segment. I'll add this bit - Tyr gained a bit of complexity in this ep - not much but some. First, he paints - so he has an artistic side. Where is Denmark Vesey when you need him!  He always commented that Tyr was the renaissance man - indeed, that has proven true! But more importantly, his little mentoring chats with Beka are key - if Tyr is integrated more into the crew as we know he will be, then we have to know how he will continue to be TYR and be integrated in. I don't yet see any real justification for Tyr to be so comfortably flying aimlessly about with Dylan, but setting that aside, this ep gave us a glimpse of how Tyr WOULD be once he is integrated into the crew - how he contributes his point of view, how the crew benefits from his contribution. It was small, and subtle, and some of it never made it to screen  but I liked what I saw, except for the lack of bonespurs. <br>
<br>
One more note - Tyr failing to wear arm sheaths is simply foolish on the production team's part... Why do Nietzscheans wear them at all? The real world reason is because they come with spurs attached, but in the DROM world - it can only be a fashion statement - a way of emphasizing their assets. The style has influenced human fashion - consider some of Beka's outfits, with armsheaths instead of sleeves. In short, I hope that we see Tyr in arm sheaths again, even if the bonespurs never come back. <br>
<br>
For complexity - I'll go a little higher than my collegues, because I'm adding Tyr in there - 15 of 20 points.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

3. Social Commentary<br>
Actually, being close to an election here in the U.S.A. makes this episode relevant. I love the various comments on what it takes to be at least one kind of successful politician. Here is where ZackAsh, knowing the brutal background that Sid has, were able to say a lot without needing to go into much detail. The reference to 'spin doctors' and such with relation to politics was nice. It gave us a bit of a view of the worse side of politics without getting lost in the details of politics. Rather, we stayed focused on a character and their relationships, which is what drama is about. <br>
...<br>
The bits of the Andromeda crew watching the news were quite nice. It allowed for some layers of interpretation beyond the Andromeda characters, which is nice for a show that's supposed to span 4 galaxies. It gave us a view of the planet and its culture. More of this would have been nice. <br>

4. Evolution of the human potential<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#FFDEAD;font-family:comic sans ms;">Here's where I want to talk about Sid and Beka. I love the growth that both of them showed. Sid is going to be Sid - but his lifeline on humanity is Beka - his ability to really love, and to care beyond himself is there. We know a guy like this isn't going to turn around overnight. Or maybe ever. But I can really appreciate his love for his niece, and that he nurtures that side of himself that allows him to care beyond himself. And it says something that he was willing to sacrifice even that for self-preservation...it shows how tenuous this hold on his own humanity really is. He hasn't evolved, but his holding on counts for talking to us about potential. <br>
<br>
Beka, on the other hand, grows quite a bit in understanding - she has always been prone to seeing things very either/or...Uncle Sid is both. That forces growth, evolution,understanding, on her part. She has to expand to find compassion for that part of her uncle that DOES love her, and she has to continue on, because she is ALL That to Sid! Without her, his humanity is lost. I took so much from this dynamic - families are hard sometimes , but dealing with them often forces growth, as Beka learned in this ep. <br>
<br>
For Evolution of the Human Potential - I give this ep 14 of 20 points.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

5. Action that is part of the story In this episode at least the action flowed from the storyline as opposed as just stuck in for mo reason. But my question is why did we need two different shoot 'em ups (probably an edict from TPTB). It just made the story choppy. In fact even the editing was choppy. I would have preferred the scene with Beka &amp; Tyr. But at least the action in this ep didn't have me walking out of the room.<br>
Points for Action that is part of the story: 8 out of 20.<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#FFDEAD;font-family:comic sans ms;">For the most part I agree. I actually thought the action was not that well done - there wasn't really any concern for the wellfare of our principals. I think more than anything, it is this aspect of the action that bothers me. It doesn't ever look or feel like our heros are in real danger - even when they should be. Still, the criteria is flows from the story - I didn't feel that it was gratuitous. SO, I give the ep a 10 here...<br>
<br>
And with that - my score is 64 of 100 points.<br>
