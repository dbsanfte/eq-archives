<br>
if you dont have a priest around then the elements dont become the body and blood. so you cant do it? so if you are in a church that doesnt believe...then its not his real blood?<br>
<br>
and then what about any wine or bread that is left over? does it stay his body and his blood? does it get thrown out? what do they do with it?<br>
<br>
and i still wonder about the thing i mentioned before about the juice that was bad and some people couldnt drink it and some felt bad after taking it. it was like sour or something? why would His blood be sour? maybe it wasnt done the in a place that believed it becomes real. <br>
<br>
so does it being His real blood and body depend on our faith only?<br>
<br>
i know these questions can seem silly and like i'm being too literal...but if its His real blood and body...thats pretty literal too. so i think all these things would apply. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeffthefinn>jeffthefinn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://webpages.charter.net/nilus/finnbutton.GIF" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your Friendly<br>Orthodox Resource</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#B87333>(6/29/03 6:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/nilus/jfinn.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eucharist</span><hr size=1> The Churches that believe in the real presence use wine not grape juice, and St Paul talks about people eating and drinking in an unworthy manner and getting sick and not only sick but dying as well.<br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:maroon;">The central place among the Sacraments of the Orthodox Church is held by the Holy Eucharist - the precious Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. In modern times the Holy Eucharist is celebrated in the Orthodox Church at the following Liturgies:<br>
1. The Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom - the usual Liturgy of Sundays and Weekdays.<br>
2. The Liturgy of St. Basil the Great - celebrated on the Sundays of Great Lent and certain Feast Days.<br>
3. The Liturgy of St. James the Brother of the Lord - celebrated on October 23 (St. James' Day) in certain places only (e.g., Jerusalem).<br>
4. The Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts - celebrated on Weekdays of Great Lent and Holy Week. (At this Liturgy there is no consecration of the Holy Gifts, but rather Communion is given from the Gifts consecrated on the previous Sunday - hence Pre-sanctified.)<br>
The Savior Himself said, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall not hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst... If any one eats of this bread he will live forever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is My flesh (John 6:35,51). At the Last Supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and give it to the disciples and said, 'Take, eat; this is My body'. And He took a cup, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, saying, 'Drink of it, all of you; for this is My blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins' (Matt. 26:26-28; cf. Mark 14:12-16; Luke 22:7-13; 1 Cor. 11:23-30).<br>
This institution of the Eucharist by our Lord is the means whereby we become united with Christ and with each other as a church, for, as St. Paul says, the goal of every Christian is to grow up in every way into Him Who is the head, into Christ, from Whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every joint with which it is supplied - makes bodily growth and upbuilds itself in love (Eph. 4:15-16). This is so since Christ is the head of the Church, His body, and is Himself its Savior (Eph. 5:23). We become part of the Mystical Body of Christ by our communion of the Holy Eucharist. As St. Paul says: The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread (1 Cor. 10:16-17).<br>
Only by belonging to the Church, or in other words, being in communion with the very essence of Christ through the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, can one attain salvation unto eternal life. Thus we can answer the question, &quot;Who can be regarded as a member of the Church of Christ?&quot; by saying, &quot;All those who have been properly baptized in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the true Son of God come in the flesh (1 John 4:2-3), and are united by the grace of the Sacraments - in particular the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist administered by the Priesthood of Apostolic Succession.&quot; <br>
The unity of all Christian believers in the Holy Eucharist is strongly stressed by the Fathers of the Church. St. Ignatius of Antioch, in his Letter to the Ephesians reminds them that &quot;all of you to the last, without exception, through God's grace are united in common faith and in Jesus Christ..., so obey the Bishop and the Presbyters in complete harmony, breaking one bread, this remedy for immortality.&quot; Moreover, the Eucharist is not only a testament to the internal and external unity of the Church, but is also the means for strengthening this unity. Therefore St. Ignatius stresses more frequent Communion: &quot;Try to gather more often for the Eucharist and glorification of God. For if you gather together often, the forces of Satan are overthrown, and his destructive deeds are wrecked by your single-hearted faith&quot; [To the Ephesians].<br>
The union of believers with Christ in the Eucharist is also stressed by St. Cyprian of Carthage who, speaking of the mixing of water and wine in the cup, gives an extended meaning to this mixing: &quot;The people are designated by water, the blood of Christ by wine. Mixing water and wine in the cup shows the people's union with Christ, the believers' union with Him in Whom they believe. Water and wine after mixing in the Lord's Cup are so inseparably and closely united that they cannot be separated one from another. In just this way nothing can separate from Christ the Church, that is, the people that make up the Church, firmly and unshakeably abiding in faith and joined by eternal, indivisible love&quot; [Letter to Cacaelius].<br>
This is reaffirmed in the Liturgy of St. Basil the Great when, after the blessing of the Holy Gifts, we pray that the Heavenly Father &quot;unite us all, as many as are partakers in the one bread and one cup, one with another in communion with the One Holy Spirit.&quot; Thus we can say that whereas entrance into the Church begins with Holy Baptism, its fulfilment lies in the Holy Eucharist.<br>
Orthodox Theology sees the Holy Eucharist as a sacrifice and this is affirmed in the words of the Priest, when he says, during the Eucharistic Canon, &quot;Thine own of Thine own we offer unto Thee on behalf of all and for all.&quot; The sacrifice offered at the Eucharist is Christ Himself, but He Who brings the sacrifice is also Christ. Christ is, at one and the same time, High Priest and Sacrifice. In the prayer before the Great Entrance, the Priest prays: &quot;For Thou art the Offerer and the Offered, the Receiver and the Received, 0 Christ our God....&quot; This Eucharist is offered to God - the Holy Trinity, and so if we ask the threefold question, What is offered? By Whom is it offered? To Whom is it offered? we say in answer, Christ. In addition, the sacrifice is offered &quot;on behalf of all and for all,&quot; for it is a sacrifice of redemption which is brought for the living and the dead.<br>
According to St. Nicholas Cabasilas, a medieval Orthodox teacher, the Church's understanding of the Eucharist is, as follows: &quot;In the first place, the sacrifice is not only an enactment or a symbol, but a real sacrifice. In the second, that which is sacrificed is not bread, but the very Body of Christ. In the third place, the Lamb of God was immolated only once and for all times. The Eucharist sacrifice consists not of the real or blood sacrifice of the Lamb, but in the transformation of bread into the sacrificed Lamb&quot; [Commentary on the Divine Liturgy, 32].<br>
According to the Orthodox Church, then, the Eucharist is not just a reminder of Christ's sacrifice or of its enactment, but it is a real sacrifice. On the other hand, however, it is not a new sacrifice, nor a repetition of the Sacrifice of the Cross upon Golgotha. The events of Christ's Sacrifice - the Incarnation, the Institution of the Eucharist, the Crucifixion, Resurrection and Ascension into Heaven, are not repeated during the Eucharist, yet they become a present reality. As one Orthodox theologian has said, &quot;During the Liturgy we are projected in time to that place where eternity and time intersect, and then we become the contemporaries of these events that we are calling to mind&quot; [P. N. Evdokimov, L'Orthodoxie, p. 241]. Thus the Eucharist and all the Holy Liturgy is, in structure, a sacrificial service.<br>
How all this takes place is a mystery. As Metropolitan Philaret of Moscow wrote in his Longer Catechism, concerning the changing of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ, &quot;this none can understand but God; but only this much is signified, that the bread truly, really and substantially becomes the very true Body of the Lord, and the wine the very Blood of the Lord.&quot; Furthermore, as St. John of Damascus states, &quot;If you enquire how this happens, it is enough for you to learn that it is through the Holy Spirit.... We know nothing more than this, that the Word of God is true, active and omnipotent, but in the manner of operation unsearchable&quot; [On the Orthodox Faith, IV, 13].<br>
Concerning the Communion itself, in the Orthodox Church both laity and clergy always receive Communion of both the Body and Blood of Christ. The Communion is given to the laity in a spoon containing a small piece of the Holy Bread together with a portion of the wine, and it is received standing. A strict fast is observed, usually from the night before, and nothing can be eaten or drunk after waking in the morning before Communion. As a theologian of the Church has well put it, &quot;You know that those who invite the Emperor to their house, first clean their home. So you, if you want to bring god into your bodily home for the illumination of your life, must first sanctify your body by fasting&quot; [Gennadius, Hundred Chapters].<br>
After the final blessing of the Liturgy, the faithful come up to kiss the Hand Cross held by the Priest and those who have not communed receive a small piece of bread, called the Antidoron, which, although blessed, was not consecrated, having been taken from the same bread(s) from which the Lamb was taken in the Proskomedia. This bread is given out as an expression of Christian fellowship and love (agape).</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <br>

The Holy Eucharist is called the &quot;sacrament of sacraments&quot; in the Orthodox tradition. It is also called the &quot;sacrament of the Church.&quot; The eucharist is the center of the Church's life. Everything in the Church leads to the eucharist, and all things flow from it. It is the completion of all of the Church's sacraments -- the source and the goal of all of the Church's doctrines and institutions. <br>
<br>
As with baptism, it must be noted that the eucharistic meal was not invented by Christ. Such holy ritual meals existed in the Old Testament and in pagan religions. Generally speaking the &quot;dinner&quot; remains even today as one of the main ritual and symbolic events in the life of man. The Christian eucharist is a meal specifically connected with the Passover meal of the Old Testament. At the end of his life Christ, the Jewish Messiah, ate the Passover meal with his disciples. Originally a ritual supper in commemoration of the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, the Passover meal was transformed by Christ into an act done in remembrance of him: of his life, death and resurrection as the new and eternal Passover Lamb who frees men from the slavery of evil, ignorance and death and transfers them into the everlasting life of the Kingdom of God. <br>
<br>
At the supper Christ took the bread and the wine and ordered his disciples to eat and drink it as his own Body and Blood. This action thus became the center of the Christian life, the experience of the presence of the Risen Christ in the midst of his People (see Mt 26; Mk 14; Lk 22; Jn 6 and 13; Acts 2:41-47; 1 Cor 10-11). <br>
<br>
As a word, the term eucharist means thanksgiving. This name is given to the sacred meal-not only to the elements of bread and wine, but to the whole act of gathering, praying, reading the Holy Scriptures and proclaiming God's Word, remembering Christ and eating and drinking his Body and Blood in communion with him and with God the Father, by the Holy Spirit. The word eucharist is used because the all-embracing meaning of the Lord's Banquet is that of thanksgiving to God in Christ and the Holy Spirit for all that he has done in making, saving and glorifying the world. <br>
<br>
The sacrament of the eucharist is also called holy communion since it is the mystical communion of men with God, with each other, and with all men and all things in him through Christ and the Spirit. The eucharistic liturgy is celebrated in the Church every Sunday, the Day of the Lord, as well as on feast days. Except in monasteries, it is rarely celebrated daily. Holy Communion is forbidden to all Orthodox Christians on the week days of Great Lent except in the special communion of the Liturgy of the Pre-sanctified Gifts (see below) because of its joyful and resurrectional character. The eucharist is always given to all members of the Church, including infants who are baptized and confirmed. It is always given in both forms -- bread and wine. It is strictly understood as being the real presence of Christ, his true Body and Blood mystically present in the bread and wine which are offered to the Father in his name and consecrated by the divine Spirit of God. <br>
<br>
In the history of Christian thought, various ways were developed to try to explain how the bread and the wine become the Body and Blood of Christ in the eucharistic liturgy. Quite unfortunately, these explanations often became too rationalistic and too closely connected with certain human philosophies. <br>
<br>
One of the most unfortunate developments took place when men began to debate the reality of Christ's Body and Blood in the eucharist. While some said that the eucharistic gifts of bread and wine were the real Body and Blood of Christ, others said that the gifts were not real, but merely the symbolic or mystical presence of the Body and Blood. The tragedy in both of these approaches is that what is real came to be opposed to what is symbolic or mystical. <br>
<br>
The Orthodox Church denies the doctrine that the Body and the Blood of the eucharist are merely intellectual or psychological symbols of Christ's Body and Blood. If this doctrine were true, when the liturgy is celebrated and holy communion is given, the people would be called merely to think about Jesus and to commune with him &quot;in their hearts.&quot; In this way, the eucharist would be reduced to a simple memorial meal of the Lord's last supper, and the union with God through its reception would come only on the level of thought or psychological recollection. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, however, the Orthodox tradition does use the term &quot;symbols&quot; for the eucharistic gifts. It calls, the service a &quot;mystery&quot; and the sacrifice of the liturgy a &quot;spiritual and bloodless sacrifice.&quot; These terms are used by the holy fathers and the liturgy itself. <br>
<br>
The Orthodox Church uses such expressions because in Orthodoxy what is real is not opposed to what is symbolical or mystical or spiritual. On the contrary! In the Orthodox view, all of reality -- the world and man himself -- is real to the extent that it is symbolical and mystical, to the extent that reality itself must reveal and manifest God to us. Thus, the eucharist in the Orthodox Church is understood to be the genuine Body and Blood of Christ precisely because bread and wine are the mysteries and symbols of God's true and genuine presence and manifestation to us in Christ. Thus, by eating and drinking the bread and wine which are mystically consecrated by the Holy Spirit, we have genuine communion with God through Christ who is himself &quot;the bread of life&quot; (Jn 6:34, 41). <br>
<br>
I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh (Jn 6:51). <br>
<br>
Thus, the bread of the eucharist is Christ's flesh, and Christ's flesh is the eucharistic bread. The two are brought together into one. The word &quot;symbolical&quot; in Orthodox terminology means exactly this: &quot;to bring together into one.&quot; <br>
<br>
Thus we read the words of the Apostle Paul: <br>
<br>
For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, &quot;This is my body which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&quot; In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as you drink it, in remembrance of me.&quot; For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death, until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread and drinks the cup in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord (1 Cor 11:23-26). <br>
<br>
The mystery of the holy eucharist defies analysis and explanation in purely rational and logical terms. For the eucharist -- and Christ himself -- is indeed a mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven which, as Jesus has told us, is &quot;not of this world.&quot; The eucharist -- because it belongs to God's Kingdom -- is truly free from the earth-born &quot;logic&quot; of fallen humanity.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <br>

this doesnt make sense to me..when I read the bible and was saved by Jesus, he didnt say all of those things. not the way i read it at least.

i agree it defies analysis...but i dont think Christ is a mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven.<br>

it doesnt make sense to me that it would take a man or priest to make the elements into his real blood etc. he didnt say that was what was needed.<br>

<br>
i dont think you can pull out one line and say that he means that in a literal way. then nobody was saved until he even had the last supper. John 6 to me uses the I am the bread because they were all hungry and he just fed them...and then he was saying that He is the way to life. so he was showing them that by saying he is ther bread of life. <br>
<br>
he also said he is the gate...and people dont think they pass to heaven by going outside thru a gate. he says he is the light and the good shepherd and he lays down his life for his sheep. but we dont think we are literal sheep. and he says he is the vine..but we dont think we are literal grapes. <br>
<br>
i was reading acts and one of the things that showed me how to be saved was when i think Paul told someone who asked how to be saved..he said believe in Jesus and you will be saved. so i wonder why he didnt also say you have to eat his flesh and drink his blood.<br>
<br>
<br>
when did this belief begin? when was it first taught this way? It doesnt seem like Paul thought it was needed to be saved. if he didnt think it then wouldnt he not be saved himself?<br>
<br>
and again..why does it take a man to make into the blood and flesh?<br>
<br>
i can understand people have different beliefs and traditions...the thing in common is the belief in Jesus. What i dont understand about this kind of teaching though is that based on what you say...me and alot of other people are not saved and will go to hell because we are not part of the 'church'.<br>
<br>
this is the worse result in teachings like this i think. that because of a tradition or teaching..there are christians who basically condem others who belief in Jesus and love God to hell.<br>
<br>
i dont see how you ca read this any other way:<br>

St Paul also said be transformed  and that does not take place in an instant, but is a life time process.  Our Lord said to take up your cross and follow me.  The Eucharist is indeed food for the struggle and journey, it is a foretaste of the feast to come.<br>

<br>
I personally do not believe communion saves a person (that is by faith in Jesus Christ), but that communion is a sacrament, a way in which we receive God's grace, which is distinguishable from regenerating grace.  As a side note, and NOT to offend my fellow mates here, but I believe that one of the abuses of commemorating the Lord's Supper is to be found by a look at Roman/world history.  The threat of excommunication, as an ecclesiastical sentence, was/is taken very seriously, as if man has the ability to withold God's grace from the body of believers.<br>
<br>
With your questions about WHO may be blessed, or 'anointed' to offer communion, (I've thought about this too), think also of the sacrament of marriage....are we married then because the priest has said words over us?  or is the true marriage when two people enter into a covenant with God?<br>
<br>
I have much to do in studying about this, but I think maybe some of your/our concerns rest on our ability to look at the 'gifts' of the church (the Body-of Christ--all believers)  Paul writes much about the specific gifts and qualification of the 'leaders' of the church. (I'll try to put my finger on specific verses later this morning), certainly, even in Christ's days on earth, marriage was a sacrament, and a priest joined together two in a ceremony.....<br>
<br>
And, regarding taking communion in an unworthy manner...take a look at 1 Cor. 11:23-33.  Paul says that vs.26)for as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes...therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.  But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup.  <br>

<br>
<br>
heart...good point about the marriage ceremony. the thing that is different to me about it, is that if its the communion that saves you and it takes a man to have to bless or give the communion to you, then a man is needed for you to be saved. i can understand the idea of leaders in the church in general who may be annointed for certain things..like marriage and even giving communion..but not for a direct role in saving people. Jesus did that and he doesnt still need to do it or need help from us. <br>
<br>
and if you just take it once that way..are you saved..or do you have to keep taking it and believing it to be saved. <br>
<br>
about the unworth manner...exactly what is an unworthy manner? is it taking it not believing thats it Jesus's real blood body?<br>
<br>
the more i think about this 'real' blood/body idea the more confusing it is and the more questions come to my mind about it. especially when you get into having to do it to be saved. <br>
<br>
i dont want to offend people here either...but if someone is saying i am going to hell because i dont believe a certain teaching, that may come from a tradition...i find that the highest offense to me and to others. i just dont know enough about it all to even understand if thats what its teaching. there are alot of things that have to be answered beyond just the real blood and body. some of which i asked in other posts.<br>

I don't want to add to your confusion; when I get to this point about a theological question, I take up the Word, pray and ask God for direction.  Please don't look for any ONE person to point you the right way here...it's great to share in the arena of ideas, but I believe the best study is directly from the Word, praying and talking to a pastor/priest in your area face to face.  Too many concepts/definitions, etc. are lost in this type of format and besides, I think we are getting away from BrianT's OP.<br>

Dear lady, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">NO ONE</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> is questioning your salvation here...that should never happen in ANY format (writing or speaking/witnessing) in my opinion. We are only examing doctrine/history and tradition.  I think Jeff is trying to answer some of your questions from the Orthodox view the best he can --perhaps he, or others may be willing to exchange emails with you and go point-by-point to help in your understanding?    Or maybe you could start another thread and go point-by point?  <br>

<br>
it doesn shake my salvation though...its only arrogent and ignorant to me. and it wouldnt make me say people who believe it are not saved. <br>
<br>
<br>
i'm not confused by what I think about things like communion or looking for someone to explain it to me...i'm confused by why others think what they do and ask to have some understanding.<br>

<br>
Moderator hat here for a moment.<br>
<br>
I also don't think that Jeff intended an overt or even veiled questioning of another Christian's salvation.  It's one of the biggest no no's here and I know that neither HJ or I would let that happen.<br>
<br>
I could honestly post something very similar from Roman Catholic doctrine, as in that regard both it and Orthodoxy are quite similar.  However, there is a caveat in the Roman Catholic doctrine under their ecumenical writings which do say that there is much of God and the Holy Spirit with our &quot;separated brethren&quot; and that God's grace can and does act in a regenerative manner with those people.  While it would likely condemn the person who originally came up with what they consider false doctrine, they do not condemn those who follow such doctrine, provided it remains - for the most part - within orthodox Christian belief.<br>
<br>
I don't know if the Orthodox chruch also carries this caveat, but I would think it would be likely.  So while they may believe that Christians within their church are saved in that manner, it is not necessarily the way that all Christians are saved.<br>
<br>
I hope that makes things sound a little better, for all concerned.  I now return you to your regular thread. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>
