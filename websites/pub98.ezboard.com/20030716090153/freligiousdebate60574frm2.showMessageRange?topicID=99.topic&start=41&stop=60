I just wanted the memorial service. I now have seen and heard just how pompus our president sounds with the whole religion issue. Whether he means it or not, he does come off sounding that way. He sounds like a preacherman (my husband's word for him) not a president.<br>
<br>
I know very very very little of the Hindu religion. Do they have an equivalant to a minister/priest/rabbi? I noticed they had a Rabbi and a minister at the memorial but nothing to represent the others. <br>

The constittion assures that no law should be made that establishes a FEDERALLY run religion nor prohibits the free practice of religion.  (Ironically at the time several states had state supported religions) <br>

It does not ANYWHERE in consitution that citizens  have the right to not be exposed to others people's religions, just that you have the right to practice your own.  <br>

SOCAS has been twisted to mean that no one in any official capacity should have show or practice publically their own personal religious views.  While I agree that Pres.

I don't think it's quite fair to interpret this without taking account of the political philosophy of the 18th century, and what exactly is meant by the &quot;Laws of Nature&quot;.  It evolves from Hobbes, continued with Locke and has alternate theories put forth by Rousseau - whose political philosophy was very influential in both the French and American revolutions.  The &quot;Law of Nature&quot; is not exactly a desirable state nor one that rational beings would aspire to.<br>
<br>
The concept behind it is that to avoid being subjected to the &quot;Law of Nature&quot; we allow ourselves to be ruled and follow laws - for Hobbes it meant a monarchy, for later thinkers - the republic.<br>

The choice of the word &quot;Creator&quot; and the plurality implied by the word &quot;their&quot; is the interesting part of this passage.  <br>
<br>
Even more interesting is what is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> said.  It does not say G-d or Jesus Christ, but that each [hu]man is created equal by <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>their</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> creator, allowing for the inclusion of all belief systems.<br>
<br>
At no point does either document say &quot;this is a Christian Nation&quot; - to say it does implies the 'national' religion and also elevates the interpretation of one belief system above others.<br>
<br>
As the President is the representive of the people <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>and</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the government, his expression of religion reflects on every American and the government itself.<br>

Second, I do not have a problem with Bush expressing his religious beliefs.  Everyone has the right to do so.  However, they shouldn't be expressed while fulfilling his presidential duties.  I don't think the Christians would like it if their children had a Muslim teacher who was constantly expressing sentiments in the classroom regarding Islam.  Sure, she can admit she is Muslim, maybe talk about her practices from a cultural standpoint, and answer any question one might have of Islam, but to push it on the class during lectures is a whole different story.  The Christian parents would be up in arms regarding SOCAS issues if that was the case.  Bush is using his power to push his views on the public.  I don't care if he wants to discuss dogma until the cows come home on a Barbara Walters special or something, but when he is standing up and speaking in his government role, he needs to be fair to ALL his constituents, and he needs to keep his beliefs to himself.  I think that some Christians tend to feel that when SOCAS comes up, then we are trampling on their freedom to practice their religion.  I think everyone has a right to practice their religion how they see fit as long as it doesn't harm anyone.  If you need to pray several times a day or read your bible, then fine.  It is just that this religious practice shouldn't be invading the rights of others.  Bush is invading people's religious freedom by pushing his own beliefs off on people when they are expecting him to be discussing national business.  People are feeling duped.  Imagine if your doctor called you in claiming to be discussing medical business, and when you got there he just talked about his religion.  He would be using his power to grab hold of you and try to push off his beliefs.  If I pulled this crap on my clients, my bosses would boot my butt out of this firm.  I don't claim to want to discuss their accounting work and then start talking about Judaism.  I could claim that it is my right to talk about Judaism to my clients under the Constitution, but we all know that it is wrong and unprofessional.  The only thing that prevents it from being unconstitutional is that I work for a private business.  Bush doesn't work for a private business.  He is a governmental official employed by all the taxpayers.  Not Christian taxpayers, but all taxpayers.  And nowhere in the Constitution does it say that people should be forced to live under the rule of Christianity.  Yes, the majority of Americans happen to be Christian, but that is just a matter of demographics.  If this country goes through an enlightenment period and the majority decides to become Hindu, then do we call this place a &quot;Hindu Country&quot;?  Do we sit by while our president discusses his polytheistic beliefs?  Do we send around joke e-mails about being a true American and &quot;anyone who doesn't worship Krishna can just go back to where they came from&quot;?  Do we claim that those who eat beef are now putting a financial strain on others like we currently do with the mythical &quot;kosher tax&quot;?  I think it is real easy to say that this is an {insert religion here} country when you are the majority religion.  I would be real curious to see what happens if the tables ever get turned.<br>

All SOCAS implications aside, do you not consider it remotely insensitive, arrogant, and narrowminded of Bush to say what he said, given the diverse beliefs of the shuttle crew, let alone our nation at large?  I'm wondering how you would feel, honestly, if Lieberman were president and he offered a prayer in Hebrew?  If every time he addressed the nation, he said something about his religion, something exclusively Jewish, something you didn't believe and could not agree with?<br>
<br>
We're all familiar with the Declaration of Independence;  I had to memorize a large portion of it in fifth grade.  Bear in mind that it is *not* law.  The framers of the Constitution convened years later to lay out the groundwork of our federal laws, and expressed their ideas about religion's place in government quite clearly through the first amendment.  Whether or not they, as individuals, believed in a Creator or a God or a Savior is irrelevant.  I'm tired of the argument that, despite the First Amendment, we are an implicitly Christian nation, simply because the men who drafted our Constitution had in some other forum, some other correspondence, professed to hold Christian beliefs. . .   as though &quot;Freedom of Religion&quot; is the result of some legislative oversight.  <br>
<br>
As Gaia said, there are actual &quot;Christian&quot; nations in Europe that have enough respect for citizens of differing beliefs to exclude their own personal religious thoughts when  addressing the nation.  The irony is overwhelming.<br>

Nor does it say ANYWHERE in this thread that we do not want to be &quot;exposed to other people's religions&quot;. Apparently you cannot tell the difference between being exposed to something and having your own president act on behalf of you and the rest of the country and prosyletize. Nor do you see the danger of Bush's faith based initiatives that stem from his unwillingness to follow the 1st amendment as your own elders do. <br>
<br>
Tell me--would it be okay with you for a president to take all his clothes off and draw down the moon on the White House lawn as part of a speech mourning the loss of astronauts or perform a Satanic ritual? No? If not you are not logically consistent and are using the same bias Bush and his croonies are in passing out govt money to religious social help groups...but of course only to those they approve of. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>SOCAS has been twisted to mean that no one in any official capacity should have show or practice publically their own personal religious views.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

The 1st amendment is what it is. It has not been twisted, nor have xians been forced to hide away and give up their religion. This is fallacious and revealing of how paranoid groups who have long enjoyed special priveleges due to majority status get when it looks like the free ride is over. <br>
<br>
Tell me--would it be okay with you for a president to take all his clothes off and draw down the moon on the White House lawn as part of a speech mourning the loss of astronauts or perform a Satanic ritual? No? <br>
How about if a president expressed constantly his views on how LDS are satanic and are going to burn in hell? Wasn't it you that pointed out how a Missouri governor called for harm to come to Mormons?? Wasn't he just &quot;expressing his religious views&quot;?? What if he hadn't called for killing, but just said how you are all full of crap and going to hell and too dangerous to be around other people's children (like gays and atheists are subjected to regularly by govt officials right up to the very top)? Would you &quot;twist&quot; SOCAS to protect yourself and have these officials respect the 1st amendment then?<br>

As do we all respect his right to practice his religion. Wish him and his fundie cronies respected the rights of Pagans, Muslims and others...oh well. The point here, which you cannot seem to get your mind around is that there is a difference between practicing religion and even being proud to wear a cross, start of David etc....heck even saying &quot;I'll pray for you&quot; and the crap he spews in an official capacity. I work with many very devout people who don't feel the need to tell everyone in a staff meeting who's going to hell, that they pray alot--just so we all know, and other points of theology with which they agree. They'd be in HR real quick and with good reason....why do you expect so much less of a President representing an entire country?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Whether you like what he has to say or not he has the right to say it/do it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, he doesn't. He can believe and practice privately as he wishes, but he cannot &quot;establish&quot; a religion or publicly advocate for one over the others in a presidential capacity, nor is it appropriate or legal for him to use the power and resources of his office to do so. He can believe in flying unicorns for all I care and sacrifice tadpoles on a velvet covered altar in the bathroom, but this is PRIVATE. Why can't xians tell the difference? Have you been imposing yourself on others so long that to not do so makes you feel infringed upon? How sad and pathetic...and cruel of you really. But how predictable.<br>

From what I have read, it seems that there is an opinion that it should be ok for Bush to express his religious beliefs while acting in his role as president.  Well, my question to you (Christians here, they seem to be defending this stance) what if he was a Satanist or an athiest?  Instead of saying things like he said, he said something like, &quot;I greive with the families in this, but always keep in mind that because there is no afterlife they will never have to suffer again...&quot; Or something along those lines?  I am not being to articulate right now, but you get my drift.  <br>

I would have no problem if &quot;Pres. Lieberman&quot;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
shared a Jewish prayer thought or scripture, a Muslim president said a muslim prayer.  Heck as long as he didnt get naked in public, I would even support a satanist saying whatever prayer he wanted.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the 11th Article of Faith there are 13 AoF that express our basci doctrine.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>11 We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
The scripture he quoted was in Isaiah.  Other faiths not just Christian hold the OT as scripture so he was not spewing only Christian stuff.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Instead of saying things like he said, he said something like, &quot;I greive with the families in this, but always keep in mind that because there is no afterlife they will never have to suffer again..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <br>
<br>
The only problem I would have with this statement is that is just as insensitive. NOT that it was religiously based.<br>
<br>
I disagree with the fundamental idea that the President should not ever express his religion in public.  I also disagree that any expression of that faith is commiting the federal government to a state religion.  What better way to demonstrate that this is a country based on religious freedom. And what should be a country of religious tolerance.<br>
<br>
For people who are so into personal rights and freedoms, THIS attitude to me seems inconsistent.  I can get an abortion and end the life of another human being, but heaven forbid (no pun intended) I should pray or express my belief in God.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as the faith based initiatives, the LDS church politely said no thanks, we will keep doing it on our own, cuz we dont want you stickin your neck into our business.  But if a luthern church has a social service arm and do things that other non-profit charities do, (like adoptions, food pantries, drug addiction programs)why should they be exempt from federal help that those other charities get, just because the organization was formed by a church?  That doesnt make any sense to me.  Giving them the same help that other nonprofits get to do social service work does not equate creating a state religion.  Especially if you allow any and all churches to participate as long as they meet criteria. -- Shirene<br>

<br>
No one, nada, none of us has said he cannot have and practice his faith.  No one is saying that.  Please stop responding as though we are telling him he cannot hold his personal faith.  We have not said that.<br>
<br>
If you were in a car crash and the paramedics showed up and rather than stopping your bleeding they knelt in prayer for you, that would be professionally irresponsible.  If you were hired as an archetiect to design a home and the owners gave you a list of what they wanted for features and you tossed it out and drew up what you wanted, disregarding their feelings, that would be professionaly irresponsible.  If you were a chef and the patron told you he had a food allergy and you put that ingredient in anyway before delivering it to him because your cullinary style required it, that would be professionally irresponsible. As a tax payer, as a citizen, as an american, he works for me.  He works for you, he works for Kate, he works for Heather.  As my employee I expect him to work professionally and do as little to alienate his constituants as necessary.  What he did was grandstand and preach.  It was insensative, it was offensive, it was unecesary.  In his professional capacity, it was irresponsible.<br>
<br>
As delightful as it is that LDS trot out their differences with other religion's doctrine, you miss the point in the faith initiatives issues.  It doesn't matter that you turned it down.  Hell, you probably would have spent it more responsibly than brutha Graham or the other satanic xians who lined up for the pay-off (How ironic that they presented just enough opposition to the prez to get him to pay them FIRST and they all just fell in line after?)  The fact is, it is needless.  If the gov't is bad at doing charity, stop doing it.  Don't corrupt the groups that are good at it.  Don't take our money and give it against our will to organizations we wouldn't support.  Leave it the hell alone!  How much more money would there be for charity if we didn't have 19 layers of gov't &quot;Handling&quot; it for us?  How much more egalitarian if I got to decide what charities my money went to?  How much more AMERICAN for us to have FREEDOM.<br>
<br>
You try and make it appear inconsistant, but it isn't.  Give us our freedoms, and keep your own.  We are not asking him to state things he doesn't believe.  We are not asking him to stop believing what he believes.  All we want is our money to be spent in a way that treats us fairly.  Not better, not superior, just equitably.<br>

and Shirene for the umpteenth time I remind you that NOONE had ever said he cannot or should not express his faith in god by saying, &quot;we are praying for you&quot; when mourning. He can even wear a cross or Star of David and go to church every Sunday and bow his head at state dinners to say grace. Why can you not distinguish between this and promoting one religion over another. <br>
<br>
You never answered my questions either. Sure you don't mind Jewish prayer, but how about Satanic? Is it okay with you for a student to lead the class in prayers to Satan every day during school time? Is it okay for a Baptist President to get up and tell the country how most of us will burn in hell for not agreeing with his doctrine? <br>
<br>
Are you or are you not okay with that governor who told folks to kill Mormons? Would it have been fine with you if he had spewed hate...you know just expressing his beliefs about LDS without specifying you should be killed?<br>

Currently the secular nonprofits do not pay taxes, except for maybe certain circumstances such as too much funds being spent on lobbying or bringing in money that is unrelated to its tax exempt purpose.  Donations to these organizations are deductible by the donors.  I haven't audited a church yet, but I do know that they are not only tax exempt, but they also aren't even required to file a form 990, unlike secular nonprofits.  One thing people tend to forget when they are getting all concerned about &quot;discriminating&quot; against faith-based organizations is that this money doesn't come from a bottomless pit.  I have seen very needy and worthwhile nonprofits lose grants or at least have them scaled back due to shortage of funds in particular programs.  These funds have come directly from federal agencies, and they have come from state agencies who are passing the federal funds through to the nonprofit.  The grantee applies, and then the agency sits down and figures out who gets money and who doesn't.  If we give these funds to faith programs, then that just thins out the pool for the nonprofits who are currently getting funds, nonprofits whose sole agenda is to help the community, not to help them after worship.  It is bad enough right now that these organizations are suffering since 9/11 due to lack of funds.  I just had to inform one of my clients the other week that after audit adjustments, they are suffering from a big fat loss.  This is the same organization who has empty shelves sitting down in their food bank.  But yes, let's take more of their funds away and give it to the local church.  We want to make sure that church has plenty of money left over for prayer books after they do their charitable work.  Blech.<br>
<br>
There is also no reason these churches can't be in the business of helping the community as well.  Forming a nonprofit organization isn't rocket science.  If these churches want to receive federal funds, then they could take a few board members and have them form a seperate nonprofit entity.  There is no reason the church has to directly have federal funds, unless of course they want these funds to be used for religious purposes.  The government won't even tell the entity that they can't preach while doing their community service.  I audit one nonprofit who can't even get through a board meeting without prayer.  But at least we know the funds are being used for their intended purpose.  These faith-based initiatives are nothing more than a smoke screen for the right wing religious agenda. <br>

Shirene, this is the crux of the issue:<br>

You state you believe that he was insensitive; then you negate this statement by saying that, despite its inherent insensitivity, he should say what he believes because - darn it!- he has freedom of religion.  His freedom of religion, then, in your eyes, supercedes any presidential obligation, any professional responsibility.  <br>
<br>
As Americans, we enjoy a number of freedoms. . . but that doesn't mean that it is always appropriate, fair, or safe - even for private citizens - to employ them.  That is why the Supreme Court interprets the law and sets certain reasonable parameters for freedom.  &quot;Fighting Words&quot; are exceptions to our freedom of speech; the case CAD posted above limits the religious freedom of people in public office while acting in a public capacity.<br>
<br>
I recently read an article about another case involving freedom of expression. . . it dealt with the Mormon Church's attempt to ban what it considered &quot;offensive&quot; speech, T-shirt slogans, and behavior (such as same sex couples holding hands) from the public square in front of the Mormon temple in Salt Lake City.  Funny how you're all worked up about Bush's freedom of religion, while your church is attempting to stomp other people's freedom into the ground.<br>

Jen, the property in question (one city block)was purchased by the LDS church from the city for 8 million dollars.  It was turned into a Parklike pedestrian plaza (fountains refelctive pools benches etc.)  It was the city street directly in front of the Salt Lake LDS Temple.  The public is very welcome!!!!!!!!  (T-shirts holding hands and all)The ONLY free-speech that is in question is some wonderful &quot;Christian&quot; groups have decided to protest Mormonism ON OUR PROPERTY and yell vile things at wedding parties and other passerbys.  <br>
<br>
The church and the city agreed that the public should have access to walk across and enjoy the plaza 24 hours a day, as it is in the heart of the city and to go around would be an inconvenience.  Both parties happily agreed to this.  To show good faith, LDS church and the city agreed that the city would maintain a public easement as long as controll of all the property was retained by the church.  Great!!!!!!! everybody happy, nope.  The ACLU decided to sue because they figured public access across should equal free speech on the PRIVATELY owned piece of land.  <br>
<br>
The compromise in the works now is that the city is going to give up the easement ( a gentlemans agreement will still stand that the public will be welcome and have access 24 hours a day) and the church will donate another piece of property (worth $1.5 million) to the city and 3 individuals including LDS member John Huntsman will donate $1million each to build a community center on the property. <br>
<br>
The stupid thing is there are public streets and sidewalks that border the other 3 sides of the temple, 3 sides of the church office building  all four sides of the genealogy library and church history museum, where these same groups have been protesting without ANY problem for years.   I canot fathom why they would want to be so rude as to ruin someones wedding day, or disturb the peaceful setting of a parklike plaza designed to be a green sanctuary in the middle of hustle and bustle of the city.  The other thing is, it is PRIVATE property. <br>
