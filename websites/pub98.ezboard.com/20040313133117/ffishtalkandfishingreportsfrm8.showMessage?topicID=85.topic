&quot;<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:medium;">Decision could be near on alleged world-record bass <br>
<br>
Tom Stienstra   Thursday, December 18, 2003</span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->   <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;font-size:medium;">The bizarre twists and turns of the nation's biggest outdoors story of the year -- an alleged world-record bass caught at a small lake near Santa Rosa -- could lead to a final answer in the next week by the International Game Fish Association. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've had 100 calls already this week from all over,&quot; said Doug Blodgett of the IGFA in Florida, which presides over world records for fishing. &quot;I want it to be resolved as quickly as possible. There is still information coming in from the confirmation committee.&quot; <br>
<br>
Blodgett said he hoped for a decision by Christmas. <br>
<br>
At the center of the storm is a largemouth bass said to weigh 22 pounds, 8 ounces. That would break the Holy Grail of fishing records, the 61-year-old record of 22-4 caught in Georgia by a postal worker named George Perry. <br>
<br>
Leha Trew of Santa Rosa quietly mailed a submission form to Blodgett and the IGFA this fall claiming the record. According to the form, Trew caught the bass at 70-acre Spring Lake in the Sonoma County foothills, weighed it on a certified BogaGrip scale on shore, and then released the fish unharmed. Her son, Javad Trew of Petaluma, and Charles Fleming of Santa Rosa, a picnicker at the park, witnessed the weigh-in, according to the form. One photograph of the fish accompanied the submission. <br>
<br>
By IGFA rules, Trew fulfilled requirements for a world-record, believes George Kramer of WON Bass based in Southern California. <br>
<br>
Yet hundreds have called the episode the hoax of the year and expect the IGFA to throw it out. <br>
<br>
&quot;There's just too many things not right about this,&quot; said Terry Knight, of Lakeport, who has worked as a pro bass guide, tournament fisherman and researched the claim. &quot;The worst of it is that her son (Javad) claims to have caught a line-class world record bass the following week, 18 pounds, 8 ounces. A lot of people think it's the same fish used twice.&quot; <br>
<br>
Leha Trew of Santa Rosa and Javad Trew of Petaluma refuse to talk to media, according to several reports. Attempts  to reach them by phone or in person failed. Neither is listed in phone directories or internet searches. Fleming, who was identified as a witness to the weigh-in, was contacted but did not return calls. <br>
<br>
That elusiveness adds to many questions that undermine Trew's signed claims in her submission to the IGFA: <br>
<br>
* Length and girth smaller than existing records. Trew's fish reportedly measured 29 inches long with a girth of 25 inches. That is smaller than the current world record (32 inches long, 28-inch girth), the California record of 21.74 pounds (28 1/2 inches long, 26-inch girth), and the unofficial state record (because it was released) of 22.01 pounds (29 1/2 inches long, 27 1/2-inch girth). <br>
<br>
* Scarce photographic evidence: Only one photograph of the fish is believed to exist. According to Blodgett, this is another particularly troubling aspect to the IGFA committee, which use photos and videos to help verify size claims. <br>
<br>
* No park witness: Rangers at Spring Lake Regional Park did not see the fish or verify the weigh-in. <br>
<br>
Same fish used twice?: When most largemouth bass weigh about a pound, what's the chance of a mother and son catching and releasing bass weighing 22 pounds and 18 pounds within a week at a small regional park lake? It would be similar to Boy Scout troop leader Lil of the TV show Survivor claiming to have captured and released Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden on back-to-back weekend camping trips. <br>
<br>
Spring Lake seems an unlikely setting for a fracas being debated across North America. This little lake is the centerpiece for a regional park for car camping and picnics, and is stocked with small trout in late winter and spring. However, DFG recognizes that Spring Lake was stocked in the 1990s with Florida-strain largemouth bass, the breed that grows to large sizes. <br>
<br>
This story is not the first time that Spring Lake has been the site of an alleged hoax. In 1997, a Santa Rosa angler said he caught a giant bass that weighed 24 pounds on a bathroom scale, then released the fish after it was photographed. The story was reported as fact in magazines around the world, including as a cover feature in Outdoor Life, but also widely disputed as a hoax. That fish was never proposed as a record. &quot;<br>

<br>
This stunt has really gotten under my skin.  I just wonder if I'm the only one who feels that way about it.<br>
<br>
I'm not hardly as mad at the woman for pulling it as I am at IGFA for coddling her with it.  IMO, the decision on this should have been swift and final.  &quot;No mam.  You may have very well caught the world record, but you have failed to bring it to the weigh in, therefore, you petition for acceptance has been denied.&quot; <br>
<br>
Over the years fishing tournaments, I've seen some incredibly stupid things happen.  Specifically, I've seen people release their fish before the weigh in because the assumed they didn't have enough to be in the money and didn't want to fool with weighing in a loosing string.  Later they found out, the 2 pounds of fish they had would have actually gotten them a check.  In that case, I don't care if they were weighed on 50 scales in the boat and 60 people saw them do it, they still don't count because they didn't follow the procedure of bringing them to the official scales and having the weighmaster of the tournament inspect and verify the fish.  <br>
<br>
In this case, I don't think its unreasonable to expect that a world record bass has been inspected by A Game Warden, A Biologist, A tournement official or some other person knowledgable of the fish.  A son and a bystander just doesn't cut the mustard in my mind.  <br>
<br>
The more I hear, see and read, the more this sounds like a &quot;Fish Tale&quot; and not based in truth.  I'm sure IGFA is afraid of lawsuits or discrimination or something else they'd have put their foot down, but they are they record keeping body just like the official NFL Stat Keeper.  Rules are Rules and they should be followed.  I'm sure that the Perry fish didn't get near the scrutiny I'm expecting in this case, but then again, his fish was supper, that was 1930 some odd, and times were quite different.  I'd venture to say that baseball records from the 30's aren't as accurate or as complete as they are today either.  The thing is, that fish when caught today is worth well over 5 million bucks.  It not just a case of Lucky 13's anymore.  Its big business, and people are looking to win that lottery.  I figure if this is allowed, more like it will be allowed and 10 years from now, the world record largemouth will be no bigger of a deal than someone setting a track record at the Pomona Drag Strip.<br>

I'm in the same boat as you, and I think there is a lot on board with us.  Here's the kicker in my mind.  They portray themselves as naive and having little fish knowledge.  Yet the son portrays himself on the web as the best bass fisherman around.  Even gets his own page on Worldrecordbass.com.  Where the world record picture was first posted back in August before the mother threatened a lawsuit.  Let me fill some of us in here on the &quot;Boga Grip&quot;.  It's extremely expensive by scale standards.  I've seen it anywhere from $110.00 to $150.00.  So they portray themselves as weekend anglers who have been fishing for 4 years and didn't know any better about the fish being of record size.  Yet they had knowledge to get a Boga Grip that can be certified, and pay such a expensive amount for it.  I doubt that was left in the truck either as they say.  Like I said I'm mad at both parties here.  It's obviously a very nice bass, and it would have made the cover of many magazines without lying about it.  IMO That's exactly what this mother and son are doing (Lying).  There's a great article located on our site about certifying a scale, and how you go about getting the fish certified.<br>
Here's the link.<br>

How can I? There is no verification of it at the time from the proper people to do the verifying. Or that it did not meet all the guidelines the rules lay out for registering a record fish. Our whole system on every thing we do no matter what it is is based on checks and balances, which includes a claim to the world record bass. I'm not going to say they are both liars though, well,, because I don't know if they are lying, for the same reason as above. Lot of folks have extended credit, may be they heard about the expensive Boga Grip and charged it. May be they bought it off Ebay,cheap,from a sucker. I found a tackle box laying in the middle of the street one time full of tackle. May be they found the Boga Grip in the street.<br>
I think the lesson here is if you think you have caught the world record bass at the time of the catch (or even a state record bass) or think you caught it after the release and didn't know any better, you better know at least the rules of registration or you are just sh*t out of luck on the deal. Or at least you should be, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Nice bass though.<br>

It's possible they could have gotten by many different means.  I do not have one due to the cost, but rather use the berkley digital scale.  Having been in the boat with someone who does own one.  They are a very accurate scale to have.  Just not to the nearest 10th of a pound.  They measure to the nearest half pound.  <br>
<br>
I think I came across the wrong way on that, but I believe it said they went as far to get it certified.  Wasn't that before the the catch?  Someone correct me if I'm wrong on that.  Well anyways, I'm omitting much of the knowledge I have on the story and these people.  Calling them liars may be a bit much, but I feel a big injustice is being done by unseating one of our most treasured fishing records in the book.  Look at a photo of every bass that has been caught over 20 lbs., and if you can convince me that the fish she is holding is bigger than any of them.  I'll be a monkey's uncle.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Personally I just wish this fish would have gotten it's due.  It's certainly a extremely big bass, but not the record that they are claiming it to be.  It's measurements don't add up to be the record either.  So if their measurements aren't accurate, how much stock should we put in that the weight is accurate.  <br>
<br>
I will leave you with this.  According to past posts on boards and websites.  Between this lady and her son.  They have caught 4 bass over 18 pounds in the last year and a half.  I think that's a bit much.  How many guys and gals who are avid bass anglers can claim that?  They should play the lottery. <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">

I too am not pleased with the IGFA. In articles it has been mentioned how many people have contacted them about this fish. Everyone can't be wrong. A misleading newspaper article put out on the 19th gives the impression that the fish was identified by a Game &amp; Fish representative. The article says: <br>
<br>
ìDzialo said the bass was identified by a state Fish and Game representative and was weighed on a certified scale before Trew released it.î<br>
<br>
That gives me the impression that the rep was present when the fish was caught. I think it even implies he was there when the fish was weighed and released. Dzialo is the Executive Director of the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame, which also recognizes this fish as an unofficial world record. I think they require an autopsy for a record to be official. What a joke. I already emailed the writer of the article and am waiting for a reply. Statements like that lend further credibility to this fairy tale. The truth is the G&amp;F rep identified that the fish in the picture we have all seen is a bass. Whoopee!<br>
<br>
Here is another statement:<br>
<br>
&quot;Their excitement mounted as Leaha Trew struggled to pull the bass aboard the boat, and they used the last frame on their last roll of film to snap its picture -- and then released it.&quot;<br>
<br>
But wait, if she struggled to land the fish (she doesnít seem to be struggling to hold it up in the picture), snapped a picture and released the fish how was someone on shore able to witness the (alleged) weighing and measuring? They might have seen someone do it but they sure as heck couldnít read the tape. In fact, in this version weighing and measuring arenít even mentioned. Looking back at the picture it looks like she might be in a boat. I donít see any land and you can see below her knees. So what did the witness actually ìwitnessî? He witnessed a scam, thatís what. That or he is every bit as dishonest as they are. I saw on a fly fishing message board for trout fishermen this story mentioned yesterday for the first time. Every person that replied soaked it up like it was a legitimate story.

Catching 4 bass over 18 pounds in a year.  Come on.  Do they think I'm that stupid.  Well, maybe Rowland caught 4 over 18 pounds this year on his TV show, but we all know how his fish grow on his camera.  I know there are people who catch 10 pounders regularly, and I have personally known a guy who caught a 16 pound largemouth, but of all the anglers I have and do know many of whom are some of the best, I don't know any of them who have caught multiple 18 pound bass in a year.  Doug Hannon is one who I interviewed for an article some years ago, and although I don't remember now, he told me at the time how many bass above 10 pounds he had caught.  I don't think he would have tried to claim he caught 4 over 18 in his lifetime much less the last 6 months.  And we are talking about a professional big bass fisherman with years and years of experience catching Big Fish.  <br>

There's an interesting take on this situation on BassFan.com, including an opinion on why it wouldn't be worth a million dollars. The opinion is written by their media critic, known only as &quot;Mr. X&quot;, who they claim is a well-known person in bass fishing and whose name would be recognized.<br>

If she goes to the grave thinking she caught the world record bass then that is her business and she will have to find another way to become a millionaire, give or take some dollars, if that's what she wants. Or she can catch that bass again so we can have a better look at it.<br>

Could they get any more outlandish in their tall tales?  That was a good article.  I'm kind of curious who X is.  Anybody got any ideas?  <br>

From the IGFA's standpoint they have to save face. How do they gracefully back out of this? They already awarded her the line class record, didn't they? If they did, how do they say it was a legitimate fish and now it isn't? Either way their credit will suffer from this.<br>

What was this award?  The Heisman Trophey.  You see, ABC had a vested interest in Charles Woodson getting the award as opposed to Peyton Manning simply because Woodson was in the bowl on their network.  The last 2 months of the season, ESPN and ABC pulled an all out blitz campaign to take the trophy from the guy who most people knew for 3 years prior to that deserved it when his year came, after all, how many athletes would turn away the largest contract in NFL history to play their senior year in college.  Nope, their award became about money and tv ratings.  I'm sure some Michigan fans might disagree about who deserved the award, still I think most reasonable people saw through the smoke.  From then on, I could care less who wins the award since they would prefer to base it on tv ratings than the player.<br>

I'm sure the T.V. networks can influence in many different ways.  What bothers me is that they tend to vote for the guy that they are covering in their part of the country.  So unless the voting writers are distributed evenly throughout the country.  I don't know how it could be a fair vote.  Seems to me that they would vote for the guy they saw the most, and covered.  It's just like many things that we put in regard.  It gets stomped out by things like the IGFA.  I have no regards for them anymore for giving the line class record out.  How can you?

That freshwater fishing hall of fame or whatever that organization is seems rather silly to me.  I don't know how you certify a lineclass record larger than the world record.  Does anyone really believe that 8 pound line would pull a 23 lb largemouth through grass????????  Next thing you know guys on Okeechobee will be fishing with 4 lb test since the largest likely fish is probably only 12 pounds.  No sense in overkill using 20lb line that everyone else has used there for years.  <br>
