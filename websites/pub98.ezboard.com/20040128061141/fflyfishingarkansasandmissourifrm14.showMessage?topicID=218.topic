Qualify here.</span><hr size=1>   We've discussed it and passed around some Ideas and here is what we came up with.  It might not be perfect and the language may not be the greatest but it's all in fun and designed to attract those who look but do not participate to register.  Our goal is 100 registered members by Feb 17th which will be the 1st anniversary of this board.  There is a heck of a lot of knowledge here that can be tapped and added to.  We're looking for folks with knowledge and those without.  So this is a place anyone interested in FF'ing can come to get or give info on fishing the rivers of Arkansas and Missouri.  Heck we'll talk about other places too!<br>
<br>
Here it is:<br>
<br>
A drawing for various STUFF donated by members (more stuff to be added as we go I hope) to be held at the Gathering or Fish in to he held during the sow bug round up in march of 2004.  At that time the STUFF will be given away via a drawing out of a hat (so to speak). Witnesses will be present.<br>
<br>
Heres how to qualify:  After registering add your post below in the {JUST REGISTERED? Qualify here} topic and include a description of who you are, Where you are from and what you fish for or would like to fish for.  Also tell us how you found out about this Bulletin Board.    <br>
<br>
Each registered member begining with #73 Flyfish Michigan will then be entered for winning some Stuff.  Only one prize per winner at the drawing for some STUFF.  (I could get really technical here but I won't)  <br>
<br>
We are also giving a guided trip on the white river to the person who referes the most folks.  So let us know if there is someone who turned you onto this BB Cause I'm gonna take that person on a fishing trip. Lunch included, flies, leaders and tippit provided by John Wilson.  John and Jimmy T. are disqualified from participating in either of the above mentioned and can not win any STUFF.  Everyone else who has ever registered can qualify for this one.  so some one may actually get some stuff twice on this one.  (hope I made sense here).<br>
<br>
Heres the small print; but big enough to actually read:<br>
<br>
Dubious registrants, Post,  ect will be deleted.  Any post made below that is not of the nature described above will vanish. So please make suggestions, donations, ect on another post.  Idealy we'd like to see all new registrants get some STUFF but that is probably not possible.  It depends on the donations.  You do not have to be present to get STUFF if your name is drawn and it will be sent to you via USPS at no charge to you.  Some STUFF may be changed due to conditions out of our control.  This is a first for us and we'll make it work one way or another, we may also have to edit and re-phrase a little as we go so bear with us Ladies and Gents.<br>
<br>
So Flyfish Michigan and Haulohaulic would you please lead the way and Qualify.<br>
<br>
STUFF donated so far.  I will add as we go.<br>
<br>
Reuel: A couple of dozen flies<br>
Haulohaulic: A couple of dozen flies<br>
Dano: A mini fish'n pak.<br>
Flyfish Michigan: A dozen wet flies<br>
Flysoup: Tieing Tool(S)<br>

Fly Fishing for 6 years.<br>
<br>
Home Water: Little Red<br>
I averaged about 60 days a year here during college at Hendrix.  <br>
<br>
Favorite Shoal: Dripping Springs 400 yards above Pangburn Bridge.  I understand access has recently been, er, restricted up there.<br>
<br>
I am from Lowell and have fished Beaver like the day is gone.  Have fished Norfork and the White multiple times.  I tend to avoid the White these days, after being caught in generation at Rim Shoals (which was my own fault, and stupid.)  I got distracted by the absolute lack of fish on a 90 degree day and we decided to go swimming.  Bad idea.<br>
<br>
I'll throw a line at anything with fins.  Other than Rim Shoals, the stupidest thing I have ever done while fishing was take my one man cataraft over the horizon at Gulf Shores.  It was morning and the wind was at my back, and I was chasing mackerel (believe me, they were winning that race.)  I went to drop my anchor rope and had three turns left in the basket on a 40 foot rope.  That got my attention.<br>

<br>
I'm originally from northeastern PA, moved south after graduating college.  Started flyfishing when my mom bought me my first flyrod (glass Wright &amp; McGill) at age 9.  That was 32+ years ago.  Took two semesters of flyfishing classes from Joe Humphreys at Penn State, where I became totally addicted.  George Harvey made as big an impression on me as Joe did.  Flyfished the lower Laguna Madre in 1984, when NOBODY was fishing a flyrod down there.  Boy, did I get some looks...<br>
<br>
Moved to NM, where I fished the San Juan, Taos area, and Cloucroft area every set of days off.  Then ten years in Alaska.  Still consider Alaska my home, going up every summer or fall for a couple weeks.  Now I live in Texas, and fish bass in lakes and rivers, trout in the Guadalupe and Ozarks, and of course reds/specks/flounder in the bays down here.  Also enjoy offshore for ling, dolphin, tripletail, kingfish, etc when weather permits.<br>
<br>
FFF Certified Casting Instructor, love teaching.  Making bamboo flyrods, but not proficient yet.  Give me a few years.  Enjoying the heck out of this website, learning lots from the Arkansas experts.  Thanks for all the guidance, John, Jimmy, Andrew, and everyone else sharing.<br>
<br>
Unlike Zach, I'm not willing to divulge my stupid mistakes (God knows, there are plenty to choose from though).<br>

I began fly fishing 2 years ago this month.  I was fortunate enough to learn from Dave and Emily Whitlock in Midway, Arkansas.  I got caught 5 large trout the third day of school and since that time, all I think about is fly fishing.  I started tying flies the following March and love that too.  I was honored to teach this year at the Texas Expo.  My 7 year old grandson got interested in fly fishing during spring break in March 2002.  Now he is fishing and fly tying almost as much as I do.  I am always looking for a new place to fish and someone who loves the sport at least as much as I do.  I have fished some of the rivers in the hill country of West Texas, and some private lakes in the south.  Anxious to learn how to site cast to red fish in the bay!  I just made my first fly rod at Rodmakers in San Antonio and that was a lot of fun!  I look forward to meeting other fly fishers and learning more about the great state of Arkansas on this web site.

You betcha, we'll have some big fun on the Guad.  Our first TFF outing is on the 9th.  Can you be there?  We'll meet at Rio Raft at 08:00, fish a while, and then reconvene there for burgers or cold cut sandwiches at 12:30.  After the lunch break we'll fish 'til dark (or later, as our courage permits).<br>

No donations necessary, we're just glad you're here.... <br>
<br>
Some of the guys are pitching in some flies, gear, trips, etc for some of the new members. This give aways will be determined by drawing during the Sow Bug Round-Up later this spring. Our anniversary as a website is February 17th so we are doing a give away to mark the occasion.<br>

I live in the St. Louis area.  You are right, this is the best fly fishing site I have found.  It's hard to get this type of information without hiring a guide everytime out.<br>

After lurking around this site since last spring I figure that it's time to register.  You guys are a tremendous source of trout fishing wisdom and knowledge.<br>

I've been fly fishing for about 35 years for mostly bream and bass (with an occasional trout fishing trip to AR or east TN). About 3 years ago I fished the Norfork tailwater for the first time and fell in love with it. I introduced my twin boys (now age 12) to trout fishing on Dry Run Creek and they are hooked for life. <br>
