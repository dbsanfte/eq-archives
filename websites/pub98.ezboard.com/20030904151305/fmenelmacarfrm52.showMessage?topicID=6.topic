<br>
        Things had proceeded less well for the loyalist Varjans, who had suffered disappointment after disappointment in the same period. A few weeks after the election, with activity at an all time low, Thomas Hubert had resigned as Varjan president in favor of (the now also Menelmacari) Zarathustra Erutirn. But this regime change had failed to improve matters, so that the two, by this time Varjas only real active citizens, elected to give the nation to still-flourishing Baracao as a province. They brought with them a few hundred pixels of MCS land, two citizens, and an abiding dislike of Menelmacar which carried over to their parent country all too well.<br>
        The Baracaoans, being communist, needed their capitalist fascist oppressors to complain about and keep the people in a state of continual revolution and war-readiness. The Soviet Union had their USA. China had theirUSA. Cuba had theirokay, this thread of discussion is closed. But for the Baracaoans, Menelmacar must have seemed a gift from the God they didnt believe in. Sirithil was a known macronational conservative, to the point that calling her a Reaganite would not be out of place, and Menelmacar was built on strong anti-communism principles which were enshrined in its constitution. Further, a number of micronational events happened at this time to cement the feud. First, the remnants of Tymaria and Baracao came close to the brink of war a number of times over the rebel Tymarian territory of the Free Republic, and Sirithil, having taken the position of Tymarian Foreign Minister, was definitely part of the enemy camp. Second, Menelmacar began to drift towards a loose friendship with Attera, while Baracao also forged the beginnings of what would eventually become the Venceramos-Rastakhiz Pact with Babkha, Atteras traditional enemy. <br>
        Things only got worse when Philip Locke decided to defect to Baracao. He had been growing more and more communist for some time and decided the revolutionary state might be a better place for him. When the Baracaoans kicked him out along with Ryan Caruso for sympathizing with Menelmacari counterrevolutionaries, he decided to quit Menelmacar instead, and take Freenesia with him, although he did not bother informing Menelmacar of this. When the secession came out, there was much outrage, and the two countries briefly considered war, until it was finally agreed to much grumbling on all sides that Baracao would get two-fifths of Freenesia while Menelmacar kept the rest. Philip Locke redefected (as is his wont) from Baracao back to Menelmacar a few weeks later anyway, so it did not cause too much of an issue. <br>
        These were the big things, but the little things were equally bad. Sirithil went to the Baracaoan off-topic forum, Chez Guevara, and argued persuasively for the inherent evil of communism, and the Baracaoans responded in kind in the Menelmacari Tavern of the Mind. The Baracaoans used a nifty script to change the avatars of major Menelmacari leaders to Cuban dictator Batista, and the Menelmacari in turn changed Baracaoan avatars in Menelmacar to Josef Stalin (which, knowing the Baracaoans, they would probably take as a compliment) and, in one very odd instance, a slice of limburger cheese. Another thing that didnt help was Bob Silby, a foul-mouthed and extremely undiplomatic Baracaoan who led the anti-Menelmacar faction being appointed as the ambassador to Menelmacar.<br>
        When Menelmacar was attacked by a number of small bombs in September, it was generally suspected to be the work of Baracao and quite possibly of Silby himself, who was known to have carried out similar attacks in the past. The Menelmacari accused the Baracaoans, and the Baracaoans said the Menelmacari should be ashamed of themselves for making accusations without evidence. There it languished. Sort of. The Menelmacari created Area 52, a secret military planning forum, to take anti-Baracaoan operations into their own hands. From the beginning, Area 52 was marred by some of the worst security ever, and I include nuclear laboratories during the Clinton administration in that statement. The password was accidentally posted in a supposedly secret forum that Eoin Dornan had access to, and Eoin shared the password with micronational reporter Scott Siskind, who, in an extremely rare show of restraint, did not publish the entire matter immediately. The two of them continued to obtain information for about a month until the matter was discovered by Bill Dusch, and used their knowledge to foil a few less ethical Menelmacari plans like Operation Jade Wolf, the attempt by Ryan Caruso to gain control of what was now the barest bones of an excuse for Tymaria. Other operations in the Area included an attempt to throw the Baracaoan chairman elections, which was never really carried out particularly well but which the Baracaoans guessed was going on and for which the the Menelmacaris got in trouble.<br>
        Perhaps Menelmacars most successful  and yet most troublesome  battle in the great cold war with Baracao was their sabotage of Pacary. Pacary was the other half of the great Baracaoan block, the Alliance of Free States. It also had Sirithil as a citizen. Taking advantage of the general belief that Baracao was responsible for the recent terrorist attacks, she started and pushed through a vote to withdraw Pacary from the Alliance, over the extremely strong objections of Pacarian leader Sander Dieleman and of Pacarian Defense Minister Scott Noseworthy. Unfortunately, a backlash in Pacary led to an even better relationship between the two countries. Baracao, out of respect for the Pacarian leaderships distaste for the vote, offered to defend Pacary without mutual obligation on their part, and also created a Foreign Legion in which non-Baracaoans could work to defend Baracao. Sander, bomb-maker extraordinaire, joined the legion, as well as Minister Noseworthy and even some who had been totally uninvolved with the AoFS before. Sirithil, disappointed and slightly guilty, started a vote to rejoin Pacary to the alliance, which succeeded. However, the Baracaoans were now hopping mad about Menelmacari interference (particularly successful Menelmacari interference, which is always the worst type) and began grumbling and plotting. Thus began an even more ugly phase of the cold war, which would not end until both nations had it knocked out of them by catastrophically unfortunate occurrences.<br>
