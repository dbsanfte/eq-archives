Would you vote for someone who was an orthodox member of any faith, or would you only support people who either are &quot;non-intensive&quot; believers, or non-believers altogether?  Do you think the faith of the president impacts his performance of the office, and how does this relate to the separation between church and state?  <br>

But with Lieberman....Given the current middle east issues this country is having, and given how I feel about our involvement over there, especially in the Palestine/Israel issues, I wouldn't vote for him. Plus he's really big into censurship and that's a big turn off to me as well. <br>
<br>
Ok, I would also have to say I would hesitate over voting for a fundie christian as well. Heck, anyone who makes a big deal over their religion would worry me (ok so I'm revising what I first said now that I have thought about it). If they are fundimentalist in their religion (whatever that is) I would worry about their objectivity in certain areas. And I would be more likely to vote for the less religious person if I was waffling between the two<br>

The one thing I do like about him is that he is a centrist, which means he won't be afraid to stray from his party on issues, as opposed to just pushing a party agenda across.  As for his orthodoxy, that all depends.  I don't mind Orthodox Jews or Christian fundamentalists as long as they don't try and push their religion off on everybody.  If his religion is for him personally, then I couldn't care less if he is Orthodox, but if he wants to push so-called biblical values off on everyone, then I would take issue with that.  I don't think his faith would get in the way of his duties anymore than a strong Christian faith would get in the way.  He is pretty strict on observing the Sabbath, but he has already said he would work if necessary.  He wouldn't let the country fall to hell on Saturdays or anything.  As for the Israel/Palestinian issue, I don't think he would be much different than any other president on that issue.  Bush supports Israel despite the fact he isn't Jewish, as did Clinton, Bush, Reagan, etc.  Any aid to Israel or Muslim nations would need to go through Congress anyway, so it isn't like he would just cut a big fat check to them every year (well, fatter than what they already get).  There is a human and political story behind support for Israel, and it isn't just about religion.  People see it as a religious issue because it is a war between religious states, but there is a lot more to it that our non-Jewish politicians see.  I do think it would be nice to see a Jewish president in the sense that it would show America is breaking down the religious/cultural/gender barriers, but I wouldn't use an affirmative action agenda to cast my vote.  I don't know much about the different Democratic candidates yet, but so far I'm not sure that Lieberman would be my first choice.  He seems like a good guy, and I don't think his religion would get in the way, but as I said before, there are just some issues where I don't agree with him.  Anyone who thinks the mere fact he is Jewish would get in the way needs to closely reexamine the choices they have made for our Christian candidates.  I think that anyone who claims to be religious, regardless of the religion, should be closely scrutinized to see just how much their belief system would get in the way of their duties.  <br>

<br>
I know what you mean on this, and this has definitely crossed my mind too.  The reason why this doesn't concern me too much is because a lot of people who are anti-Israel think that the Jews are somehow controlling our government's actions anyway.  This is where the line gets crossed between being anti-Israel and being anti-Semitic.  It is that whole conspiracy theory over Jews trying to control the world.  I do agree that we might be viewed as less impartial by the non anti-Semites, but I don't think I'd base my vote off of what other people might think.  It is a valid concern though.  Actually, anyone other than a WASP could technically be a concern.  There are a lot of countries out there that wouldn't respect our president if our president was a woman, and the same would probably hold true if we had a black president.  Palestinians refer to Condoleeza Rice as the &quot;dark complexioned lady&quot;.  Ooof, this world has a long way to go.  I just hope that no matter what, we can have a candidate with some decent character who isn't trying to control our private lives through religion and censorship.  Whether or not that person is white or black, Jewish or Christian, male or female, I don't care.  I just want them to exist.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br>

I guess the big question for everyone is:<br>
<br>
If it came down to Bush vs Lieberman, then who would you vote for?  <br>

I think we've all made it clear that we aren't Lieberman fans, but Bush?  Wow, what a scary thought.  Maybe a new Democratic candidate will come out of the woodwork.  I think so far we have Kerry and Gephardt(who looks like he got locked in a tanning salon overnight).  It is too bad Independent candidates aren't a realistic choice.  <br>

I think Schwarzenegger would make a good president, if the laws were changed to allow him to run for election. For one thing, though he's a Republican, his wife and her family are Democrats - I think that would give him a broader view. For another thing, I think he's a caring sort of guy - read up on what he's done for children. And finally, he's intelligent, and a good businessman. He's also very charismatic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Pagles</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(1/17/03 9:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: McCain</span><hr size=1> I really doubt that we will get the 'born a US citizen' rule overturned for Arnie.<br>
