<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm asking for alternate explanations because neither one of the current leading theories seems likely to me. So maybe if you'd get your head out of your butt for a second, you would realize that I've asked for help explaining something.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Here's all the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>help</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you'll need to explain your mysterious, baffling, deeply perplexing and awe inspiring floating coin trick. But first, let's start with a card trick description that is startlingly similar to your description of your friend's coin trick:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Real Floating Card DVD         <br>
<br>
&quot;For me this changes the meaning of a repuation maker.&quot; -Joe Martinez<br>
<br>
&quot;Easily the cleanest levitation on the market!&quot; -James M.<br>
<br>
So, you like leviation effects? Well Alex Markov has created what some are calling the best of the best when it comes to close-up levitations. The performer shows his hands empty on both sides, then hands hand out or borrows a deck of cards for shuffling. A spectator then selects a card and places it on top of the deck. <br>
<br>
The magician retrieves the deck and openly places it on his outstretched palm. He tells everyone to concentrate on the card as he starts his &quot;meditation.&quot; After a few moments, the card eerily begins to rise higher and higher off the pack! It floats up and down in an amazingly smooth way as if the card is somehow floating on a cloud. <br>
<br>
Now for the best part-the performer removes another card from the pack and waves it above, below and all around the card while it's floating in mid-air! The spectator's can look anywhere they want-this is angle free! <br>
<br>
The Real Floating Card is one of those few effects in magic just as amazing for the magician while performing it as it is for the spectators watching! Truly a one-of-a-kind levitation you shouldn't miss out on.         <br>

Next, a neat little not-so-magic device that lets you &quot;levitate cool stuff&quot; - presumably coins are included in said cool stuff:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Learn to levitate cool stuff, including money, matches, cards, knives, canes, balls, and even YOURSELF! Learn the most amazing feat of magic possible – LEVITATION! No effect compares to having an ordinary, everyday object seemingly defy gravity. Watch your audience gasp with delight as they witness the miracle of levitation. On “Learning to Levitate” you will learn the closely-guarded secrets of making objects float in mid-air – things like money, matches, cards, knives, canes, balls, and the coup de grace, YOURSELF! Yes, it’s true! With no special gimmicks whatsoever, you can give the perfect illusion of levitating yourself right off the ground. And even more, it’s easy to do!

<br>
More levitation tricks:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Floating Bill And Small Objects Levitation <br>
David Blaine demonstrated a classic object levitation on his TV special where he asks a spectator to watch while he picks up a leaf and causes it to levitate above his hand. <br>
<br>
This appeared to be totally impromptu which made it even more impressive. <br>
<br>
This type of levitation is performed by using &quot;invisible thread&quot; which can either be purchased as a proprietary brand from good magic suppliers or by separating some fine polyester thread into individual strands and using a single strand. <br>
One end of this strand should be attached to some sticky tape and placed in the mouth between the gum and cheek or a high shirt button while the other end can be placed at the right moment to a solid object ( In David Blaines case, possibly the tree.) The magician then stands at the correct distance so that the string is tight and the object ( a bill or a leaf) wrapped around the thread which is above the magicians hand. <br>
<br>
This should look like the magician is just scrunching up the note in the palm of their hand. <br>
<br>
By using very small movements of the head or body, the magician can then tighten the thread causing the note to rise and is also able to move his hands around the object to show that it really is levitating. <br>
<br>
The object can then be made to return to the palm and be examined by the spectator. <br>
<br>
The magician can then casually walk away, allowing the thread to break which is not a problem as it it can easily be renewed. <br>
<br>
This trick is also performed more smoothly and discretely by use of an ITR which is used by professional magicians and which can be ordered online here by clicking the link above . <br>
<br>
ITR - MICRO<br>
SKU: 3416<br>
If you work with invisible thread, you'll want this. If you're thinking about it - STOP THINKING AND BUY IT! You won't regret it! The thread is indeed invisible, and it is strong. What's great is that it retracts into its housing so you can use the same piece of thread many times over. You're supplied with enough thread to last you for quite some time. You can float a silk, ring, dollar bill, cigarette, etc. You can make a card rise. Toothpicks or matches jump. You are limited only by your imagination. The Micro I.T.R. is so small it can be hidden virtually anywhere. We can't recommend this enough!<br>

<br>
Yet another device for amazing parlor tricks:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Imaging having a small ball first levitate in mid-air, then move to the floor, rise up again, then move to your right or left!<br>
<br>
Or let the ball fly from you to the ground, then up again to your assistant that is 50 feet (or even more!) away from you! With UFC 3D System you can make any small object move and levitate in all directions! That means back and forth, up and down and (!) from side to side! UFC-3D System uses two UFC-Float Controllers to create the maximum in levitation-effects.<br>
<br>
Each single UFC Float Controller enables you to make any leightweight object float in the air and walk 50 feet or even more away (!) from the floating object. Also you can let items float to the ground, then up again to your waiting hands. Each UFC Float Controller is electronically controlled and automatically switches on and off by simple minimal body movement.<br>
<br>
By the use of two Ultimate Float Controllers all levitations can be taken into a new dimension: Objects can fly from one person to another person and back or items can fly away, down, up again and to the side! Yes, this means not only in one direction back or forth but also to the left or right! All directions are covered by this new float control system!<br>
<br>
Important features:<br>
• Let items fly from a spectators hand to you!<br>
• Let &quot;the spirits&quot; move and animate borrowed objects!<br>
• Electronically controlled! Switches on and off automatically!<br>
• Use Close-Up or on stage!<br>
• No more broken rubber-bands or fumbling any more!<br>
• Walk up to 50 feet or more (!) away from floating object!<br>
• Levitate nearly any small object like silks, rope, finger rings, sponge balls, and more!<br>
• Bring all levitation and floating-effects into the third dimension by using the new UFC 3D System!<br>

I don't know about solved, but thanks for the theories.  I'll be able to test them out quite easily.(although some of them are already proven to be wrong.)  Oh and hopefully your proctologist can help you with your problem.  Must be uncomfortable as heck.<br>

And just so you know, magic will never die until the very last stage preformer is dead, and magick will live till the last wiccan falls from this mortal coil.

If that information did not show you that what your friend is doing is nothing more than a clever parlor trick, then I am wasting my time talking to you. Didn't you claim to be a grown man? The way you flaunt your gullibility, complete lack of critical thinking skills and childish clinging to magical thinking makes me think you are an 11-year-old posing as a grown-up.  Come to think of it, your crudeness puts you at that level too.  <br>

Phoenix--I agree magic will not die until superstition, gullibility, irrationality and denial of reality and truth subside and I see no signs of this. It is a little disconcerting to encounter a medical student so gullible (I expect to hear about a witness to faith healing or how a chicken liver was pulled from a woman's abdomen without an incision before your very eyes in Mexico City  next!!!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). As for the physicist and engineering types--I work with these guys ever day and unfortunately many of them turn of reason when it comes to religion. We have a Bible group with prayer meetings and the whole nine yards right on site and a private prayer room for Muslims as well.

I still fail to see how it is being gullible to investigate the effect until the true cause is determined.  Last I heard, that was the basis behind the scientific method.  If you find an effect that has multiple potential causes, systematically eliminate each potential cause until you find the actual cause.  When there are problems with all the proposed causes, then it is prudent to seek out other potential causes, and work through to either validate or disprove them as the cause of the effect.  <br>

Actually, the ones that I dismissed, I had already shown the problems with them prior to you suggesting them.  Remember what I said when it was suggested that perhaps my friend switched the coin with a trick coin?  To have any physical contact with the coin, he would have to dash over a two meter distance, attain physical contact(whether it be to attach 'invisible thread' or to switch coins), and get back to his original spot, all without being seen.  Now, assuming that he doesn't use mass hypnosis,(if he did, he'd not need the string, he could just hypnotize us into thinking that he is levitating the coin) that means that he has to do all of this within the time it takes for our eyes to send subsequent images to our brain.  This would require such massive forces upon his body that he would litterally crush his body.  It would also tear the invisible thread.<br>

Ten minutes later...<br>
Ok now that that is over.  <br>
<br>
If you think this next paragraph is too long, skip over it.  The following paragraph is a brief summary of it.<br>
<br>
Since you didn't understand my comment earlier, I said that you had your head up your butt, because regardless of how hard you looked, you only saw crap.(Are there any young children out there?  I'd rather not continue using euphemisms in an attempt to spare any sheltered children.)  Regardless of what I said, you automatically assumed that I believed that it had some supernatural background, and becuase of that tried(rather poorly) to ridicule me.  This showed not only that you were trying to be petty, but also that you were being closed minded, because you never actually tried to see what I was saying.  It also showed me,(based on the line that you wrote, &quot;don't dish it out if you can't take it&quot;) that you were ready for me to use some type of criticism to show how you were behaving.  Unfortunately, you were not ready for me to stop simply exposing your pettiness.  Thus your increasingly childish behavior when I decided to dish out the insults, as you had already begun.  As if that wasn't enough, when I finally decided to expose your petty behavior in an insulting way, you come back with this passage above.<br>
<br>
In short, I tried to be the grown-up in this little debacle.  You started to ridicule, and at first, I tried to clamly and maturely point out that you were doing so.  What is it that parents are always saying, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Don't lower yourself to their level.  Be more mature by remaining calm and considerate.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Once that failed, and it was clear that maturity wouldn't prevail, I tried satire to show the same thing that maturity couldn't impart unto you.  <br>
<br>
Now if you wish, we could resume the discussion without the petty namecalling. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doublelatte>Double Latte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Got Milk?</span><br>  Posts: 209<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/25/03 7:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=222.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Oh Phoenix, lookie what I found...</span><hr size=1> As I indicated yesterday morning, there is no point in wasting time &quot;discussing&quot; things with you. You earnestly postulate one thing, when what you've said is pointed out to be senseless you backpeddle and try to pretend that it was &quot;satire&quot; all along and we just didn't &quot;get it.&quot; The real insult is not your name calling but that you think any of us are not on the ball enough to see straight through your crap.<br>
<br>
You dismiss my arguments, but instead of explaining why you feel they are invalid, you call names, pick nits and split semantic hairs. Very tiresome. And if we're very lucky, you spout some incoherent half-assed rebuttal (see below for examples) and then pretend like it made any damn sense.<br>
<br>
As to your friend's coin trick, I did not see it so I'm not in a position to difinitively argue WHICH version of the trick he is doing. I'm only in a position to argue that it is a trick, not magic, telekenetics or some other imaginary ability. Now please don't start arguing the semantics of magicke versus  performance illusion, and don't try to be all slippery and pretend that you meant performance illusion all along because I don't buy it for one second. Your original posts are still up there for all to read too, so if you go back and try to edit them we'll know about it.<br>
<br>
My quote inserts aren't working today, so bear with me:<br>

I didn't bother addressing this mess LAST TIME you brought it up because it shows that you understand NOTHING about performance illusion and I didn't want to have to take the time to try to explain it to you - then listen to your assinine arguments against it. However, since you are now trying to use it again to &quot;prove&quot; that what your friend does with the coin might be something OTHER THAN a simple parlor trick, and to PROVE that you said something to refute my assertions - have to say it. You obviously know nothing about how &quot;magic tricks&quot; are done. For example, the assertion about your friend having to &quot;dash a 2 meter distance&quot; is laughable. Magician do not &quot;dash&quot; to grab a coin from a waiting assistant. They use the oldest trick in the book, it's called &quot;palming&quot; and it involves exchanging their trick coin for your coin - no assistant needed. At the end of the trick, they palm again and exchange it back, returning your original coin for you to examine in amazement. If you HAD BOTHERED TO READ the trick descriptions I posted at the top of this thread, you would see that they all allowed the use of small objects donated by the audience (no trick coin even needed here). Again, the string is not in the hands of an assistant 2 meters away, it is already in the magicians palm or stuck to his lapel, ready to attach in the wink of an eye.<br>

Actually, if you read my posts, I'm not the one who refers to it as magic/magick/magique.  In fact, if I'm not mistaken, I have not used that term since we started this little conversation.(Other than to say when they would end.)  You are the one who keeps putting that word forward, not me.  Maybe because you just keep wanting to make it seem that I'm trying to add the supernatural, despite the fact that I already know that the supernatural cannot exist within the natural. Thus, if it exists, and is supernatural, it must exist outside the realm of space-time, not within it.<br>

Ask a mech engineer to review the problem, he'll tell you that the examples shown below are reasonable conclusion.  I should know, I am one, and thus I am very familliar with physical properties of materials.<br>

Now, let's get back to the topic at hand.<br>

You don't seem to understand.  If at no point do him and the coin get any closer than two meters, then how does he attach the invisible thread to the coin.  I also did not suggest that it wasn't a parlor trick,(I don't know how many times you've tried putting those words in my mouth) I merely said that it wasn't one that required tactile contact with the object in question.  For example, I still have to test the theory that it is a UFC Float Controller, as was suggested by the last link you provided.<br>

As I posted above, I am well aware of the physical properties of substances.  I know how much force will be exerted to attain the acceleration that is necessary to have physical contact with an object two meters away in less than the time it takes the eye to refresh.  I also know that that force is higher than the maximum allowable stress for even our bones, let alone a small thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doublelatte>Double Latte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Got Milk?</span><br>  Posts: 210<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/25/03 9:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=222.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Oh Phoenix, lookie what I found...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What he does is he has someone take a simple coin out of their pocket and place it in their palm.

<br>
Even later, when you mentioned &quot;dashing two meters to a random assistant&quot; you never said he was staring at the coin from two meters away.

Only that he would be 2 meters away from the &quot;assistant.&quot; <br>
<br>
You left it out because it wasn't there. Only when it became the last thing you could think of to dismiss the magic trick methods I posted, did it suddenly and conveniently appear. You've beautifully illustrated my assertion that you are continually trying to revise what you've said in a desperate attempt to wiggle out after having been proven wrong.

For my health?  No, I thought that it made an impressive gag, and thus I wanted to know how it works.  I can't very well get him to tell me, so I've got to get theories and work out the impossible ones.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You never said he was two meters away from the person holding the coin. Only that he would be 2 meters away from the &quot;assistant.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ok, once you read this, read this;<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>He must also be very quick if he can dash over to the random assistant, swap the coin, and run back to his position about 2 meters away without anyone seeing him.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
He dashes to his assistant(2 meters away), then swaps the coin.  Now, even if we assume, as you did, that the 'assistant' wasn't holding the coin, for my friend to be able to switch the coin after having dashed that 2 meters, the coin holder has to be next to the 'assistant'.  However, by including the term 'random' before assistant, I was trying to show you that this so called assistant was in fact the person who pulled out the coin from his/her pocket.<br>
<br>
Next,<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>He has a friend in on it and they like making you look like a sucker?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Interesting theory.  You're saying that I like making myself look like a sucker.  No, I can say with certainty that I don't.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It is a trick he has worked out well?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yes, most likely.  As I said before, I would also like to figure out how it works, as he has.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>first a med student, then a practicing holistic AND pediatric practitioner and now we find out you are a mechanical engineer too?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  No.  Med student, whose first degree was in mechanical engineering, and who is studying to become a pediatrician.  The use of holistic medicine techniques is just something that medicine students will eventually decide upon.  You see, here in Canada, they require that you have university experience before you enter the faculty of medicine.  For some of the universities, they require a full degree before you enter.  I took engineering.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I am waiting for him to tell us it was his quarter in his hand next too. The last bastion of futile defenses...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actually, If you read the original post.  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm pretty sure that it's not a trick coin since one time he asked me to be the one to pull a coin out of my pocket.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  So that you can find it, it is on page 3 of the other thread, about a third of the way down the scroll bar, in the final paragraph of my post.  Begining on line five, word three.(At least with my font and window size.)<br>
<br>
DL, nice to see that you are still trying the old, If I can't beat them with logic, then I'll beat them with insults.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So I should drop out of law school and go back to engineering, then get a med degree after?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  No, based on what I've seen here,(yes I realize that you may be a completely different person in real life) you would not make a good engineer or a good doctor.  In fact, I'm not so sure that I'd want you as my lawyer either.  I'd be afraid that once you began defending me, you would try to bicker with a witness because they use the dictionary definition to a word, while you use a definition that you and some of your friends have agreed upon.<br>
<br>
Now, if you people are so intent on trying to criticize me, will you please at least get my argument straight?  I clearly said that there were problems in the mystical explanation of the trick.  This means that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WAS MAGIC</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  I clearly said (several times) that there was no tactile contact between my friend and the coin, thus no explanation that includes tactile contact between my friend and the coin is possible.  Appearently I did not explain it very clearly before,(although I thought I had) but the individual that was labeled 'the assistant' is the person at random who was asked to produce the coin.  This person is not someone who was placed there by my friend, as that would require me to already understand the trick(as I was the 'assistant' once), and as I've already said, I am the one who is trying to explain it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatar of Reason</span><br>  Posts: 314<br> <font color=#3333ff>(6/26/03 4:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=222.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rune-stone.net/Pitt/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Oh Phoenix, lookie what I found...</span><hr size=1> See guys, told ya he'd say that.<br>

Also, in the other thread you seem to have downgraded the coin stunt to &quot;a cheap parlor trick&quot; and have conveniently forgotten about originally putting forth &quot;your friend's&quot; theory that it was &quot;telekenetics.&quot; <br>

DL, have you ever been to a &quot;magic show&quot; where there is just the so-called magician and no one else on stage?  If they need someone to help with a trick, they as for someone to assist them.  That makes the person from the audience an assistant.  <br>
<br>
As far as your prediction, good for you.  You predicted that I would have to repeat myself, just as DBC did.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Nope, this was never ever ever mentioned <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
(Sarcastic tone)You're absolutely right, how could I have missed it.<br>
Yeah, so the person who was asked to <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>assist</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> in the magic trick would not be considered an assistant.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Much like the &quot;magician&quot; staring from a full 2 meters away was never mentioned until it became necessary to dismiss my theories.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yep, 'cause you posted so many theories between my first two posts on the subject.  The only theory that you posted between the time I described the situation and the time that I told you that he was 2 meters away was the suggestion that it was one of those PK COIN HALF DOLLAR trick coins.  I didn't even need to use the distance between them as disproof of that, I would have simply had to use the &quot;This amazing coin will levitate and roll over in your spectatorâ€™s hand if brought within several inches of a strong PK magnet!&quot; line from the description.  There could not be any strong magnets close and strong enough to affect the coin, while not affecting the bank/credit cards in my pocket.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>When I said that magicians don't grab props from waiting assistants anyway, you didn't take the opportunity to say &quot;no wait, the assistant is the person holding the coin.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Yeah, and for the first little while I didn't correct you when you implied that I thought it was magick.  I simply ignored a comment that you made which had no valid foundation.  Heck, the only reason why I didn't continue to ignore your invalid comments was because I did that before with DBC in the other thread.  It resulted in both being accused of not replying to a person's post, plus it would result in people thinking I just vanished.  The second part is because as this thread progressed, you quickly left logic and reasoning behind and started fighting straw men.  You very quickly left no coherent thoughts for me to reply to, only the mindless drivel that you are currently spouting.<br>
