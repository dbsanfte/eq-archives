 Title: Andromeda Pussycats (I hate it but can't think of anything<br>
else.)<br>
     Au<br>
thor<br>
: Mary Rose<br>
     R<br>
ating: G of course. Im crossing<br>
<br>
 with a cartoon for goodn<br>
ess<br>
sakes. <br>
     Spoilers: None<br>
     Disclaimer: Tribune owns Andromeda. Hanna -Barbera owns Josie<br>
and the gang. I own nothing but my love of both shows.<br>
     Summary: When the gang from JATPIOS meets the crew from<br>
&quot;Andromeda things get...interesting<br>
     <br>
     The ship drifted across space. How long had they been stranded in<br>
outer space? It seemed like forever and that there was no hope of ever<br>
geeting home to Earth. At least, not with Alexandra aboard. How many<br>
chances had they had to get home, only to have her wreck it because it<br>
all had to be about her? Josie heaved a big sigh as she stared out at<br>
the emptiness of space. Would they never get home?<br>
<br>
<br>
     Just then, Valerie's voice broke into her thoughts. &quot;Up ahead.<br>
Looks like a hole of some kind. Best to avoid it.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oohh, it's so pretty&quot;, Melody exclaimed.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Unh-yeah. Look, Im going to steer us clear of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Alexandra stepped forward. &quot;Oh, Valerie, what are you thinking?<br>
Im going to steer us clear.&quot; She and Valerie began fighting for the<br>
controls. Bleep and Sebastain were going crazy. Alan and Alexander<br>
tried to seperate them but, it was too late. Instead of steering clear<br>
of the hole, they were headed right towards it. <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     The Andromeda Ascendant was on its way back from signing<br>
up another world in the Commonwealth. Consequently, everyone was in a<br>
good mood. <br>
     Then they suddenly saw a ship appear out of nowhere. It was<br>
unlike any ship they had ever seen before. It was long, blue and<br>
tubular with a round head at the end. And it looked like it was in<br>
trouble.<br>
     &quot;We're going to help that ship&quot;, Dylan announced, to noone's<br>
surprise.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;And if they prove hostile to us?&quot;, Tyr asked.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;We'll just have tobe ready for anything. Rommie, were going to<br>
pull it in. Launch cables.&quot;<br>
*************************************************<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;See what youve done, sis.&quot; Alexander was terified. &quot;Now look.<br>
We have no idea where we are and that monster spaceships captured<br>
us.&quot;<br>
     They all watched helplessly as they were dragged towards the<br>
ship. They had no idea what they were in for.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oh, shut up, chicken brother.&quot; Alexandra was irritated.<br>
&quot;Whatever aliens are on that ship are no match for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Alan then took charge before the siblings could start arguing.<br>
&quot;O.K. gang. We don't know what we're in for so, we have to be ready for<br>
anything. Here's what we'll do.&quot;<br>
*************************************************   <br>
     <br>
     The crew gathered in the Hangar bay. They had their weapons<br>
ready. &quot;Harper, do you think you can open up the door?&quot;, Dylan asked.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Of course I can. The question is, do I want to?&quot; Dylan glared at<br>
him. &quot;O.K. O.K.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     It was a moot point anyway because the door suddenly slipped<br>
open. Dylan stepped forward. <br>
     &quot;This is Captain Dylan Hunt of the starship Andromeda Ascendant.<br>
We mean you no harm. We'd just like to help.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;O.K. Good. Nice person.&quot; Before anyone could stop her, Melody<br>
jumped out from her hiding place with Bleep in her arms. &quot;We sure could<br>
use some help. Come out, everybody. They're friendly.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
     There was no choice now. The crew standing behind Dylan, watched<br>
in shock as five more teenagers emerged from behind crates. One was<br>
carrying a cat. Dylan put his weapin down and ordered the crew to<br>
follow suit. &quot;You're just kids.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Alan stepped forward. &quot;Actually sir, we're all seventeen.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;How did you get a ship and...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;It was purely an accident.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I think its time we formally introduced ourselves.&quot; Dylan<br>
ordered his crew to step forward. He then went down the line. &quot;This is<br>
Captain Rebekah Valentine of the Eureka Maru and my first offficer.&quot;<br>
He noticed that Beka's name startled the kids but, he didn't<br>
understand why. He went on. &quot;Tyr Anasazi, weapons officer. Rommie, the<br>
ship's avatar.<br>
     Seamus Zelzany Harper, ship's engineer. Trance Gemini,ship's<br>
medic. Brother Bohemial Fartraveller, science officer. Rev Bem for<br>
short. Dylan noticed that none of the strangers were fazed by Tyr, Rev<br>
or Trance. Well, except for the dark-haired boy withh sunglasses. He<br>
was cowering. The fact that the blonde girl was holding a stange,furry<br>
white creature with antenna probably explained it.<br>
<br>
<br>
     The big blonde, boy stepped forward. &quot;I'm Alan Mayberry.&quot; He<br>
pointed to the cowering boy. &quot;Alexander Cabot III.&quot; He pointed to the<br>
dark-haired girl with a blonde streak, holding the cat. &quot;His sister<br>
Alexandra and her cat Sebastian.&quot; Then he introduced the other three<br>
girls. Pointing to the redhead. &quot;That's Josephine McCoy. Josie for<br>
short.&quot; Pointing to the only black person. &quot;That's Valerie Brown.&quot;<br>
Pointing to the blonde gir lholding the strange creature. &quot;That's Melody<br>
Valentine and Bleep.&quot; The crew gasped. Now they understood why Beka's<br>
name had startled the kids.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     They had gathered on Command. Alan and Dylan had exchanged<br>
stories. &quot;Well, you're all certainly welcome to stay on board for<br>
awhile&quot;, Dylan told them. &quot;We have plenty of room.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;May we see the whole ship?&quot;, Valerie asked.<br>
<br>
<br>
     Dylan smiled at her. &quot;Of course.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Are you sure that's wise?&quot; This from Tyr, ever the skeptic.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oh, come on, Tyr. They're only teenagers&quot;, Beka protested.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;And when I was their age, I was a deadly killing machine.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Ooh! That's not very nice,&quot; Melody said. &quot;I think you'd be much<br>
happier just listening to our music. We can play for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Your music will only drive him to kill even more&quot;, Alexandra<br>
stated. Melody just giggled.<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka stared at her. She was incredulous. Didn't this girl know<br>
when she?d just been insulted? How stupid could you be? And how did<br>
someone as stupid as that carry the name of Valentine?<br>
<br>
<br>
     Dylan jumped in to keep the peace. &quot;No need for a fight. Come<br>
this way.&quot; He led them on a tour. &quot;You're welcome to pick out any<br>
quarters you'd like.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Good. I'll show you which ones I want.&quot; Alexandra led them all<br>
back to Dylan's quarters.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Um, sorry. Those are my quarters.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;You don't seem to understand. I?m Alexandra Cabot. I desrve only<br>
the best.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Dylan glanced at his crew. Harper and Trance were openly<br>
laughing. Beka was struggling to keep her composure. Even Rev hid a<br>
smile. Rommie's cheeks were twitching. And Tyr wasn't laughing but ,he<br>
had a smirk on his face. He had to get a handle on this, quickly.<br>
     &quot;Well, I'm very sorry but ,I'm not giving up my quaters to you.<br>
You'll just have to make due.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oh, all right. If I must.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;You must.&quot; He resisted the temptation to glare at her and his<br>
crew. &quot;Come on. Let's get our guests settled in.&quot; And it wasn't easy<br>
but, they did it. They were given quarters, instruments and all.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     The kids were all likable, with the exception of<br>
     Alexandra. Even Alexander as scared and annoying as he could be,<br>
settled down once he realized that the crew was not out to hurt them.<br>
     Valerie liked hanging around with Harper. She was fascinated by<br>
all the technological wonders of the Andromeda.<br>
     &quot;Man, Rom-Doll, this girl is almost as smart as I am&quot;, Harper<br>
<br>
raved to her hologram. Valerie was on the far side of the room, looking<br>
at his projects in wonder. &quot;Do you know she's the one who fixes things<br>
for them and usually comes up with the plan? If that Alexandra chick<br>
wouldn't mess things up, they'd have been home by now.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Careful, Harper. She's only seventeen. Too young for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I'm insulted. Don't you know me at all?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yes, I do. That's why I'm saying something.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Rommie!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Harper, I know you're a decent guy. However, Valerie's the first<br>
person we've encountered who even comes close to your genius and<br>
electronic and technological know-how. I just want to make sure that<br>
things stay proper. As smart as she is, she's still only seventeen.<br>
Remember, you're quite the man and it would be very easy for a teenage<br>
girl to lose her head over you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Harper brightened. &quot;All too true. I promise that I will keep<br>
things on the up and up.&quot; With that, Rommie winked out. Harper<br>
strolled over to where Valerie was.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;WOW!!! Harper, these projects are great. They far surpass what<br>
I'm able to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Well, it's the time you live in. Trust me, if you were a member<br>
of our crew, you'd be almnost as good an engineer as me.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Do you really think so?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yes.&quot; Harper was emphatic. He liked this girl. A lot. Not in the<br>
way Rommie feared but, just as a fellow techie. He could really see<br>
himself as her mentor. How often did Seamus Harper ever see himself in<br>
that role? &quot;If you were to decide to stay aboard permanently, you'd<br>
definitely be an asset.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Valerie smiled. Then she shook her head. &quot;Im tempted, believe<br>
me. Thank you so much for the compliment. But, I have family back home<br>
that I miss. Not to mention, I'm a Pussycat. What would Josie and<br>
Melody do without me?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;They're your best friends, hunh?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yes. I couldn't ever leave them behind.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Harper understood that kind of loyalty. Another good quality of<br>
Valerie's. Harper had the same trait. He was loyal to all the crew.<br>
Even Rev and Tyr. Of course, she couldn't stay. But, he'd enjoy her<br>
while she was here.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Alan and Dylan were on Command having a talk. &quot;So, you've really<br>
got your work cut out for you with this Commonwealth thing&quot;, Alan was<br>
saying.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;True enough but, we're making progress. I've got a good crew to<br>
<br>
help me.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;That's important.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yes, it is. And what about you? I know you got launched<br>
accidentally and aren't really a crew but, then again, you are. And<br>
from what I can tell you are the unoffical leader.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yeah, I guess. But everybody's important. Valerie is way smarter<br>
than I am. And Josie...well....&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;You love her very much, don't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Alan looked surprised. &quot;Yes. And you're the first adult who<br>
hasn't said we're both too young to know what real love is.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Who am I to say that? The way you look at Josie is the way I<br>
used to look at Sarah. What does it matter at what age you meet your<br>
true love. All that matters is that you're lucky enough to meet her.&quot;<br>
Dylan reflected for a moment. Then he changed the subject. &quot;Looks like<br>
most of yor crew is pretty good. Although, I have my doubts about<br>
Alexader and Melody, It's Alexandra who would drive me to<br>
distraction.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Well, she did when she wanted your quarters although, your crew<br>
got a laugh over that.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Er-yes.&quot; Dylan still got slightly annoyed when thinking about<br>
that. &quot;How do you deal with her?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Alan laughed. &quot;It's not easy. We all have to try real hard not to<br>
kill her. Of course, having Josie around helps.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I'm sure it does. From what I've seen in the time you've been<br>
aboard, Alexandra wants to break you two up.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;That'll never happen. I love Josie with all my heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Just then, the object of that declaration walked onto Command.<br>
She headed towards them, smiling all the while. &quot;Did I hear my name<br>
mentoined? Nothing bad being said, I hope.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     As if I could ever say anything bad about you, <br>
     Josie.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;He was praising you, actually&quot;, Dylan told her.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oh, that's nice to hear.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Dylan watched as the two hugged and kissed each other. It was a<br>
nice thing to see. And as he watched he could see very plainly why<br>
Alexandra didn't stand a chance with Alan, no matter what she might<br>
try. These two kids loved each other deeply; it was plain to see.<br>
     Also Josie was well rounded. She wasn't obssessed with Alan as<br>
Alexandra seemed to be.<br>
     She loved him but had other loves as well. Her band and her<br>
friends were also imporant parts of her life. She was also a good<br>
leader. She and Alan were perfect together.<br>
     They finally broke it off and turned to Dylan.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;It was horrible to hear what would become of Earth&quot;, Josie<br>
lamented. &quot;Your Commonwealth is<br>
     it's only hope. You have to succeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I won't stop trying&quot;, Dylan promised her.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Good. I really hope you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I have to. Failure is not an option.&quot; Dylan liked these kids,<br>
with the one exception. He hoped what he said was a comfort.<br>
     <br>
      <br>
     Beka was getting tired of the running joke at her expense. Her<br>
crew-her friends-correction-the people she thought were her friends<br>
were having a field day with the fact that she and that ditz Melody<br>
shared the same last name. There was no chance in hell that they were<br>
related, so why did everybody keep harping on it. O.K. She knew<br>
why-because it was fun. But, it wasn't true.<br>
     There was no way that Beka was in any way shape or form descended<br>
from that idiot. Valentines were smart and savvy. That girl just<br>
wasn't.<br>
     Beka passed Harper and Trance in the halls. &quot;Hey, Beka, have you<br>
seen your Grandma lately?&quot;, Harper called. Trance just giggled.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I'll kill you both. Shut up. That's the last time I want to hear<br>
anything like that. Got it.&quot; She went after them but, they darted<br>
away, still laughing. Beka sighed. It wasn't<br>
     over. No one was going to stop. Beka knew this because if it had<br>
been someone else, she , herself would join in the fun. So, of course,<br>
it would go on. The only way to stop it was to get Melody and her<br>
friends off the ship as soon as possible<br>
<br>
.<br>
     And speak of the devil--. Beka and Melody came face to face.<br>
There was no way to avoid her or that pet of hers she was always<br>
carrying. Beka was going to have to talk to the dimwit. There was no<br>
escape. &quot;Hi, Beka.<br>
     How are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I'm good. You?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oh, Bleep and I are just wonderful. The Andromeda is such a<br>
pretty ship. It must be great to live here.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;It can be.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Bleep, bleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka jumped a foot in the air. &quot;What the hell was that?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody giggled. &quot;Oh, that's just the way Bleep talks. He just<br>
said you're pretty.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oh, thanks. Wait a minute. Hold on here. I'm thanking a<br>
FURBALL.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Bleep, bleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yes, you are.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka's head was whirling. &quot;You understand him?&quot; This was just too<br>
much. Beka could barely believe that someone as stupid as Melody could<br>
understand her own language, let alone an alien one.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yep. I'm the only one who can. Bleep and I really love each<br>
other. He's my best friend. Well, along with Josie and Valerie.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;O.K. Well, why don't you run along. I've got things to do.&quot;<br>
     &quot;We'll keep you company. We won't get in your way.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka doubted that but, there was no way to shake Melody. You<br>
couldn't insult her-she wouldn't get it. She'd just stick to you like<br>
glue, which is what she was doing.<br>
     Melody and Bleep followed Beka to Command. Unfortunately, Harper<br>
was also there. &quot;Hey, look who it is. It's Beka and her dear old<br>
granny.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody giggled. Beka rolled here eyes. &quot;Seamus, the clock is<br>
ticking. The countdown to the end of your life has begun. She walked<br>
over to where Dylan was standing.<br>
<br>
 <br>
     He grinned at her. &quot;What's the matter? Not getting along with<br>
Granny, hunh?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Don't you start. I swear I'm at the point where I'm going to<br>
take my gun and kill every last one of you. Then it'll just be me and<br>
I'll be captain of both ships. What do you think of that?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oh, come on, Beka, it's all in fun. And Melody's a nice kid.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;She's stupid, Dylan. There's no way I'm descended from her. She<br>
is not a member of my family. Are we clear?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Clear. But, she does like you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Give me a break. She likes everybody. She even likes Alexandra<br>
who keeps insulting her, only she's too dumb to realize it.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Well, here you are insulting her too. She's not a bad person,<br>
Bek. I like her better than <br>
     Alexandra.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka grinned. &quot;Who wouldn't? That girl is just plain obnoxious.<br>
Although, I loved how she just thought that you'd give up your quarters<br>
to her just because she demanded it.&quot; Beka laughed openly now. She was<br>
zinging Dylan back and it felt great.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;So, you found that funny, did you?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oh, yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Well, I'm very happy that that amused you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oh, so am I. So am I.&quot;<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Alexandra had not taken too kindly to Dylan's refusal to give up<br>
his quaters to her. It had outraged her. As a result, she was her<br>
usual<br>
     charming self. At the moment, she was lost. &quot;This ship is just<br>
too big and ugly. How is one supposed to find her way on<br>
<br>
 it?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Holo-Rommie appeared. She did not take kindly to being called<br>
ugly but, she was High Guard and she would be civil. &quot;It takes time.<br>
Mostly everybody who spends time on me, eventually learns their way<br>
around.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I'm sure we won't be here that long. And are you implying<br>
something here? That I'm stupid?<br>
<br>
<br>
     Because I'm not Melody.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Of course, you're not. Melody's not obnoxious and you are.&quot; This<br>
last was said in a whisper. Aloud again. &quot;Stay right where you are.<br>
I'll get one of my 'bots to guide you back.&quot;<br>
     She popped up on Command where her avatar was.<br>
     &quot;Did you get that?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Rommie rolled her eyes. &quot;She's right. She's not Melody. I<br>
actually like Melody. I can't stand her.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Who can?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Well...Melody.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yes but, Melody likes everyone.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;True. She's a very sweet kid, if not the sharpest knife in the<br>
drawer.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Holo-Rommie sighed. &quot;Well, someone has to guide her back. You<br>
want to do it?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Not particuarly. Can't we just leave her lost?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Dylan wouldn't like it. Plus, she could get into all sorts of<br>
trouble wandering around our corridors.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;You have a point. I'm still not going to do it. Send one of the<br>
'bots.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;If you say so.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I do.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Fine.&quot; She winked out.<br>
<br>
<br>
     Rommie turned back to her station and contemplated their guests.<br>
She classed Alan as being the Dylan of the bunch. He was their<br>
unoffical leader and tried his best to take care of them. It couldn't<br>
be easy. Not with the Cabot pair.<br>
     Alexandra was just--Rommie shuddered. Too bad shoving her out an<br>
airlock was not an option. O.K. She wouldn't really do it. Maybe. It<br>
was quite a temptation, though. And her brother Alexander was kind of<br>
annoying too. He was such a coward. However, unlike his sister, there<br>
was no meaness in him. And from what she could gather of their<br>
adventures so far, he could come through in a pinch. You just had to<br>
force him.<br>
     Then there were the Pussycats. Josie was a good person.<br>
Steadfast, loyal and caring. Someone you could really count on. Rommie<br>
liked that in people.<br>
     Valerie was easily the most brillant of them all. Yet, she didn't<br>
flaunt it or lord it over her friends in any way. Very down to earth.<br>
     Very good qualities in that girl. Rommie could see why the three<br>
Pussycats were devoted to each other.<br>
     Which brought her to-Melody. Interesting. Not too bright, as Beka<br>
was always screaming whenever the granny jokes came up. Which was<br>
often. Rommie had done her share. But...was that was all that was to<br>
that girl? Or could there be more?<br>
     Dylan had allowed the girls to set up their instruments on Obs<br>
Deck. Rommie had, of course, been aware of every rehearsal. Melody was<br>
obviously an accomplished muscian. She played the drums well. Didn't<br>
she also have to have some kind of understanding of the instruments<br>
Josie and Valerie played?<br>
     Maybe it didn't matter. Regardless of what was or wasn't in her<br>
head, Rommie liked Melody. How could you not? She was too sweet. <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Valerie and Harper were spending a lot of time together. &quot;You're<br>
a good assistant, Val.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Valerie looked up from her work. &quot;Do you really mean that?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yeah. For someone with no exposure to today?s technology, you're<br>
doing great with picking it up.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Thanks.&quot; Valerie smiled. Only her close friends or family called<br>
her Val. But, here Harper was calling her that. It thrilled her to no<br>
end. She was glad he felt like calling her that. &quot;I really love<br>
getting this once-in-a-lifetime oppurtunity. Everything just<br>
fascinates me. I enjoy it as much as I enjoy being a Pussycat.&quot; Then<br>
she sighed. &quot;As great as all this is, I still miss home and wish we<br>
could find a way there.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;You will. After we finish up our recruiting in this part of<br>
space, we'll go back to where we found you guys and send you back.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;That won't necessarily send us home&quot;, Valerie pointed out.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Sure it will. Remember, I'm a genuis and you are the closest thing<br>
they have to one. Between the two of us, we'll think of something.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Valerie had to laugh. She'd spent enough time with Harper to<br>
really get to know him. And she liked what she saw. &quot;That's actually<br>
comforting. I can almost believe it. Except for...one thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Harper knew what she meant. &quot;Alexandra. Well, we can fix her, no<br>
problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;We can't kill her, Harper.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Awww!! You're no fun.&quot; Then he grinned. &quot;Don't worry. I wasn't<br>
thinking along those lines. Remember, you're all destined to get home<br>
so Melody can become Beka's grandma.&quot; He snickered.<br>
<br>
<br>
     Valerie frowned. &quot;I know you only mean that as a joke but, Melody<br>
is my friend. I know she's not very bright compared to you and Beka<br>
gets really mad when you bring it up but, I love her, O.K.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Harper's face fell. &quot;I'm sorry, Val. I was only doing it in fun<br>
<br>
to zing Beka.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Which zings Melody because of what that implies.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Harper sighed. &quot;I didn't think.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Now she felt bad. &quot;I know. I understand, really. Forget I said<br>
anything. It's not like you?re Alexandra. There's no malicousness in<br>
your teasing.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Harper nodded. &quot;You got that right. I love Beka as much as you<br>
love Melody. It's just harmless fun.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I know. Don't worry about it. Teasing is different for family.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;True. And I just love to watch Beka errupt when I do it.&quot;<br>
     &quot;You are evil.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I know. I'm so proud of myself. Let's get back to work. <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Not all of the crew was happy. To escape the relentless granny<br>
jokes, Beka was spending every spare moment on the Maru. She was there<br>
now. And her mood was less then happy. &quot;This has gone on long enough.<br>
Everybody who I thought I knew has turned out to be IDIOTS! That's all<br>
they are. IDIOTS! Why am I the one hiding out? They should be hiding<br>
out in shame for smearing my name. The nerve. Everybody knows that<br>
there's no way I'm related to that ditz. It's not stopping them from<br>
bugging me about the COINCIDENCE! Because that's all it is.<br>
COINCIDENCE! You have heard of that, haven't you? Of course. Now<br>
repeat after me. Beka, we are sorry and plan to do eternal pennance<br>
for even joking about this. We all know that your ancestors were all<br>
smart and savvy and that there is no way that you are descended from<br>
Melody. We plan to castigate ourselves every day for the rest of our<br>
lives for even suggesting it. We all know it's not true. We are your<br>
real friends and we promise to never again slander the good Valentine<br>
name.<br>
     Beka was so intent on her rant that she failed to notice someone<br>
come aboard. She'd forgotten to lock up. But as they approached her<br>
she heard. Whirling around, she yelled, &quot;Who's there?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;It's me and Bleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Oh wonderful. How perfect. Now she'd have to listen to that<br>
irritating, giggly, sing-song voice. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I really wanted to se your ship. I've been all over Andromeda<br>
and I wanted to see your ship too. Andromeda's great. She's such a<br>
pretty ship and so nice too. It must be great to live on her.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;It can be. Although, I live on the Maru as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody came over to stand beside Beka. &quot;Anyways, I was curious<br>
about the Maru. Will you show me and Bleep? Please?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     That earnest, innocent expression. To say no would be like<br>
kicking a puppy or something. Beka sighed. &quot;It won't be a long tour<br>
but come on.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody oohed and ahhed the whole time. Thankfully she didn't<br>
giggle once. &quot;Well now you've seen the whole Eureka Maru. What do you<br>
think?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I think it's as pretty as Andromeda.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Bleep, bleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Bleep thinks it's pretty too. Almost as pretty as you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Gee, thanks.&quot; This stunned Beka. She didn't know what to say.<br>
Over the years she'd heard the Maru called a lot of things. Pretty had<br>
never been one of them. Obviously, Melody meant it. She wasn't smart<br>
enough to play Beka. There was also no reason to say these things<br>
unless she meant them. Saying them wouldn't gain her anything. Even if<br>
it would, she'd be too dumb to know it.<br>
     Then again, what did the opinions of a stupid seventeen year old<br>
and her furry alien pet matter to Beka? Beka suddenly found out that<br>
they did matter to her. &quot;Thanks. That's nice of you both to say.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody suddenly grinned. &quot;Do you wanna be my friend? Not best<br>
friends of course, because that's what Josie, Valerie and Bleep are.<br>
We could still be-&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka held up a hand to stop her. &quot;Yes. I'd like to be your<br>
friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Good. We're friends then. Isn't it great?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka was actually studying Melody. She had the most open and<br>
trusting face of anybody Beka'd ever met. It was amazing. &quot;Yes. I<br>
think it's very nice.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody suddenly jumped up. &quot;I have to go make friends with<br>
everybody else.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I think you have already. I know my crew considers you friends.<br>
I'm prety positive.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody laughed. &quot;I want to make it official. I want to hear it<br>
from everybody like I heard it from you. I'll see you later. Come on,<br>
Bleep.&quot; Melody ran from the Maru. And Beka could only shake her head<br>
in wonder at the pure joy and exhuberance emminating from that girl. <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Melody and Bleep were hanging out with Trance in Hydroponics. The<br>
purple pixie and Melody had really taken a shine to each other. Bleep<br>
was included in that too.(Author?s little aside. I would just like to<br>
say how much I adore Bleep. He, Melody and Josie are my favorite<br>
characters. THEY RULE!!!! Now back to your story.) &quot;It's so pretty<br>
here, Trance. I think it's the prettiest place on Andromeda.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Trance smiled and her tail wagged in pleasure.<br>
     &quot;Thank you. I really do try to keep it nice and it's always great<br>
when someone else notices. It is the best place on the ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Bleep flew onto Trance's shoulder. &quot;Bleep bleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody was just about to translate when Trance answered Bleep.<br>
&quot;Yes, Bleep. I know it's your favorite place too. Thank you for saying<br>
so. It's a nice compliment.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody was stunned. &quot;You can understand Bleep too? I've never met<br>
anyone else who could.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Trance grinned broadly. &quot;Well now you have. Bleep is a sweetheart<br>
and so are you. It's wonderful to have you both around.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody giggled. &quot;Not everybody thinks so.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Trance knew who she was talking about-Alexandra and Beka. &quot;You<br>
don't worry about them. All that matters is that you stay you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody smiled. &quot;I will. I love being me and I love everybody. And<br>
I have some new friends now. I love making friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Bleep bleep.&quot; Bleep seconded that motion.<br>
<br>
<br>
     Trance smiled at them. They were both fun to have aboard. &quot;Well<br>
you just keep on going the way you are. You are truly special.&quot; Trance<br>
had never met anyone who accepted her for who she was with no<br>
questions. Untill Melody. It was a nice change. Melody was a rare one.<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody smiled. &quot;So are you Trance. I love your purpleness. I also<br>
love your tail. It's so cute.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Melody had just won Trance's heart for life. &quot;Thank you, Melody.<br>
I quite agree.&quot; <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Rommie approached Dylan on Command. &quot;We can't keep them onboard<br>
forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I know. We're coming to our next meeting site. I think we can<br>
sign a couple of more worlds. After that....&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;There's no guarantee that even if we go back to where we found<br>
them that we'll find the hole. Or that it will take them back home. Or<br>
even to where they were.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Well, Harper and Valerie are working on repairing the damage to<br>
their ship. I'm sure between the two of them that they'll figure<br>
something out.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;To that end I've got a propopsal that's kind of underhanded<br>
but....&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Rommie sighed and began explaining. &quot;Whatever we do to help them<br>
is just going to be sabatoged by Alexandra.&quot; Dylan agreed. &quot;So, I'm<br>
thinking that when the time comes we have a little farewell party for<br>
them. I can slip something into Alexandra's drink.&quot; Seeing the look on<br>
Dylan's face she hastened to add &quot;It won't harm her. It'll just knock<br>
her out so she won't be able to interfere. The kids can then do<br>
whatever else they need to do to stop her interference after it wears<br>
off.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;It might be a good idea. I just won't do it underhandedly. Find<br>
Alan and Alexander and get them up here.&quot; Rommie did just that.<br>
     A short time later the two guys were there. Dylan explained<br>
Rommie's idea. &quot;I won't agree to it without clearing it with you two<br>
first. Alexander, I know she's your sister. Alan, you're their leader.<br>
I won't be allowing anything to be done without your consent.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Alan sighed. &quot;I appreciate it, Dylan. Although, I can certainly<br>
understand why Rommie would feel that it was necessary to do this.<br>
She's right. Alexandra is the cause of most of our troubles. It's a<br>
good idea. But....&quot; He looked over at Alexander.<br>
<br>
 <br>
     Alexander shrugged. &quot;It's fine with me. Yes she's my sister. Yes<br>
I care about her. I also know her. She's the reason we are where we<br>
are. You say it won't hurt her?&quot; Dylan and Rommie nodded. &quot;O.K. Fine<br>
then. When the time comes you do what you have to do. I trust you guys<br>
because you have been very good to all of us. Just do it. <br>
<br>
<br>
     <br>
     Josie was walking along the corridors when she ran into Rev. &quot;Oh,<br>
hello, Rev.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Hello, Josephine.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     She smiled. &quot;You don't have to be so formal, Rev. All my friends<br>
call me Josie.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Rev fell into step beside her. &quot;And you consider me a friend?<br>
You're not afraid of me?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Josie stopped and looked at him. &quot;No, I'm not. Even though, I<br>
know you're supposed to be a really horrible creature who does<br>
terrible things to us humans and other creatures.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;That is correct. It does not bother you?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Well, from what I've seen, you've overcome your nature. Either<br>
that or you work really hard and are very good at fighting it. I've<br>
seen a lot of things since being launched in space, Rev. I've even<br>
been in danger more then once. We all have. Somehow, we always manage<br>
to overcome it. The only thing we can't manage to do is get home.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Ahh, yes, that is a problem. Rooted in one particular person, I<br>
believe.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Josie smiled at Rev's politeness. They both knew who he meant.<br>
&quot;Well, I might be tempted to ask you to let loose your baser nature on<br>
her but I won't. It wouldn't be fair to you. Or very nice. So, I<br>
won't. Rev, you do know I'm only kidding, right? I know you would<br>
never do that.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Rev smiled. &quot;It is all right. I learned about humor and sarcasm<br>
from Mister Harper. He is an excellent teacher in both those regards.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;I'll just bet he is.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     The Magog smiled at that. &quot;Yes, he is. However, there are always<br>
new lessons to be learned. I am very glad to have you and yours aboard<br>
the ship...Josie.&quot; The two linked arms and continued on their way.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Harper laughed. &quot;Hey, Beka, how's Granny?&quot; Harper had honestly<br>
tried to be good but...well...he's Harper.<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka glared at him. &quot;Keep it up, Seamus. I will kill you. I'm<br>
running out of patience.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Sure, boss. See you later. Say hi to Granny for me.&quot; He ran out<br>
of Command before she could catch him.<br>
<br>
<br>
     She sighed and turned back, staring out at the stars. Holo-Rommie<br>
appeared in front of her. &quot;Are you all right, Beka?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Yeah. I just wish there was a way to get everybody off my back.<br>
It's just a coincidence that Melody and I have the same last name. WE<br>
ARE NOT RELATED!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Holo-Rommie was rather startled by Beka's outburst. &quot;O.K., Beka.<br>
Calm down. It's not that big a deal. They're only teasing and having<br>
fun because they know it bothers you. If it were someone else, you'd<br>
be doing it too.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka didn't want to hear that. Especially because it was true.<br>
&quot;But it's not someone else; it's me.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Holo-Rommie grinned and arched her eyebrows. &quot;Yes, it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka blushed. &quot;O.K. I get your point. Doesn't make it any easier<br>
to deal with.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Would it really be so bad if you and Melody were related? She's<br>
a sweet kid.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;And she's stupid. She doesn't even know enough to tell when<br>
she's being insulted. Rommie, to even suggest--.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;So, insults don't bother her. Is that such a big deal? Besides,<br>
she might not be as stupid as everybody thinks.&quot; Rommie was thinking<br>
of the conversation between Melody and Trance in Hydroponics.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;Oh, give me a break. The whole &quot;still waters run deep&quot; doesn't<br>
apply here and you know it. She's stupid and there's no way the savvy<br>
Valentines sprang from her. End of story.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;All right. But you seem to be getting along better with her.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Beka wasn't going to go into the conversation she'd had with<br>
Melody on the Maru. &quot;Well, she's likeable. I never said I hated her,<br>
just that I wasn't descended from her. There's a difference.&quot; Beka<br>
wasn't going to elaborate.<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;O.K. But it also wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that<br>
if she was your ancestor you'd be a mudfoot like Harper.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     &quot;No. I. Am. Not. A. Mudfoot. Now go away.&quot; Holo-Rommie blinked<br>
out. The planet was irrelevant. Humans had originated on Earth, so if<br>
you wanted to get techincal, everyone was a mudfoot. Even Tyr. But<br>
that had nothing to do with anything. Earthers weren't mudfoots in<br>
Melody's time. Besides, it was all irrelevant anyway, because she and<br>
Melody weren't realatives. They were only friends.<br>

As promised, here's the first new part.<br>
<br>
<br>
At Dylan's request, the crew had toned down their teasing a <br>
bit.  It didn't totally stop.  Beka was kind of getting used to the 'How's Granny?' remarks.  Even from Tyr.  She sethed inside but was no longer openly hostile.  There was no point.  <br>
The kids weren't going to be on the ship forever.  As soon as they got back to the area of space where they'd found them, they would be leaving the Andromeda.  The only question was when? <p>Mary Rose<br>

I just saw what my story looked like reposted.  There's all these question marks and no paragraph spacing.  I'm sorry guys.  O.K.  Well, now that I'm posting directly, that shouldn't happen anymore.   Here's some more.<br>
<br>
<br>
It wouldn't be soon enough for Beka.  The worst offenders by far were still Trance and Harper.  She was passing them in the corridor and Harper was the same.  &quot;Hey, Beka say hi to Grandma Melody for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
She lost it.  &quot;Shut up!  Just shut up O.K.  I'm sick and tired of that crap.&quot;  She went over and sucker punched him in the stomach and ran off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you O.K., Harper?&quot;  Trance was upset.  <br>
<br>
As soon as Harper could breathe and stand up again he nodded.  &quot;Yeah, I'll be fine.  What's up with Beka?  She really lost it this time.  I didn't know it was bothering her THAT much.  She seemed O.K.  with it lately.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trance turned and looked in the direction Beka had gone.  &quot;Obviously not.  Look, you go to your quarters and rest.  I'm going to go to Command and talk to Dylan.  We can't have this, especially with them here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trance went to Command.  &quot;Dylan, I have to talk to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure, Trance.  What's up?&quot;  Trance went into the details of Harper's run in with Beka's fist.  &quot;I thought I told you all to tone it down.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We did.  I guess none of us realized how badly it was bothering Beka.  I don't know why.  I like Melody.  It wouldn't be a bad thing to be related to her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dylan sighed.  &quot;Trance, take over here.  I'll go and talk to her.&quot;<br>

<br>
<br>
Beka, as always when she was upset headed for the Maru.  She could hardly believe she'd punched harper but he'd asked for it.  Why couldn't everybody just leave her alone about this?  Well, the question was moot; they obviously weren't going to.  The best thing to do was get away from them all for awhile.  She opened up a comlink.  &quot;Andromeda, open up the hangar doors.  I'm going on a little field trip.&quot;<br>
*************************************************<br>
In the corridor Holo-Rommie popped up in front of Dylan.  &quot;Beka's just requested the Hangar doors be opened.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.  She's not going anywhere untill we discuss things.&quot;<br>
*************************************************<br>
Beka was getting impatient.  &quot;Andromeda, open the doors.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rommie's voice came over the comlink.  Sorry, I can't do that.  Dylan's orders.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What!&quot;  She jumped out of the pilot's seat and ran toward the doors of her own bay.  This probably meant that he wanted to talk.  Well, forget it.  She changed the access codes and waited.  <br>
<br>
Sure enough, he came and tried to enter.  &quot;Beka, come on. Open up.  We have to talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, we don't.I'm sick and tired of all the crap, Dylan.  I think it's best for all if I get away for awhile.  Maybe untill we get rid of those kids.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Beka, that's no way to deal with things.  Neither is punching Harper.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He had it coming.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe he did but, that's still no way to deal with things.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is he O.K.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He'll be fine.  Beka, please let me in.  I'm not going to tell you that your felings are wrong or anything.  I just want to help if i can.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka sighed.  &quot;Fine.&quot;  She let him in and they walked to the cockpit together.  &quot;So say whatever you're going to say.  Come on, Dylan.  Tell me how wrong I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not going to say that.  Trance told me about what happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, so you're saying I was right to punch Harper?&quot;  She raised her eyebrows.  <br>
<br>
&quot;No, you shouldn't have done that.  However, i do think the teasing has gotten out of hand.  I told them to tone it down.  Guess they didn't listen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka slammed her fist on the cockpit console.  &quot;I was a good sport and took it as long as I could but it's getting out of hand  now.  I can't take it anymore.  I am not, I repeat not descended from that ditz.  Got it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;  Dylan looked at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;What!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would it really be so bad to be--?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes!  Not only is she a complete moron but she's from Earth.  Earth, Dylan.  There's no way i come from mudfeet.  Let's get that straight right now&quot;<br>
<br>
Dylan sensed something behind the anger...maybe a little fear that it was true and she was descended from Melody. &quot;Look, Beka, there's a way to straighten this all out once and for all.'<br>
<br>
&quot;How?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We can have you and melody take DNA tests.  If you're related the DNA will tell.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's a great idea.  Then we'll know for sure.&quot;<br>
<br>
'One way or the other', Dylan thought but didn't say it aloud.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you think she'll go for it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't see why not.  Let's go and ask her.&quot;  <br>
<br>
And we come to the end of the pre-written stuff.  And now the surprise I promised you long ago.  It's that you get to determine where the story goes from here.  THAT&quot;S RIGHT!<br>
YOU!  My loyal fans.  If you want Beka to be Melody's great, great, great, etc. daughter vote yes.  If you don't want Melody to be Beka's ancestor vote no.  See, I didn't know if people would think that them being related was lame or not.  Hell, I didn't even know if people would like the story.  So, I came up with this vote idea almost from the beginning.  And I like the idea.  So, please vote on this.  And I'll write what the majority wants.  This is your chance to influence the course of a story.  So vote!!!  Plug over.     <p>Mary Rose<br>

Hmmm - you want us to vote?  Cool.  Personally, I think they should be related.  Of course, it would be such a distant relationship that it would be a lot like claiming kinship with Julius Ceasar for any of us - kind of a &quot;yeah, that and 4 thrones will get you a Sparky&quot; sort of thing.  If you really want to be awful, make Harper a descendant too!  That should shut him up.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So, then I tried your e-mail that I got when you found me and I don't know if I screwed it up or what but I couldn't get it to send.  I'm not trying to ignore you.<br>
<br>
Plutarch, that's an excellent idea.  I'm counting up the votes and you guys won't know untill it's posted.  I'm not even sure how long I'm leaving the voting up.  I'd like to at least hear from Ashley Kaitlyn before I close the voting.  And of course, anyone else who cares to vote.  So, just vote and even if you make a guess as to what I'm going to do, I won't confirm it untill the next part is written and posted.  And from now on I will post as I write because like I said, that's the last of the prewritten stuff. <p>Mary Rose<br>

I tried to post before but the connection was refused when i tried to reply.  Anyhow.<br>
<br>
<br>
In due course everyone was gathered on Command and the request was made.  Alan loked at Melody.  &quot;It's up to you, Melody.&quot;<br>
<br>
Melody smiled at Beka.  &quot;You wanna know if we're related or not.  So do I.  I think it'd be cool if we were, don't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Unh-hunh.  Look, let's be sure.  Rommie, I want thorough testing done and the results double and triple checked.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rommie nodded.  &quot;Of course.  I'll do a three way DNA profile.  I'll need hair, skin and blood samples from you both.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka looked unhappy.  It got to Harper.  &quot;Hey Rom-Doll, check mine too.  Why not?  I'm sorry, Boss, for all the you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Beka smiled at him.  &quot;It's O.K.  I understand and i'm sorry about punching you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's O.K.  I guess i had it coming.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You did.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey!'<br>
*************************************************<br>
Rommie and Trance ran the tests.  They checked over and over.  Finally they looked at each other.  Rommie shook her head.  &quot;Well, that's a surprise.  I ceertainly wasn't expecting that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trance agreed.  &quot;Neither was I.  But we should go tell them.  They'll want to know.&quot;<br>
<br>
So they left Medical and headed back to Command.  Beka jumped up.  &quot;Well?&quot;<br>
<br>
Trance cleared her throat.  Um--well, it looks like you and Melody have matching DNA.  98% in fact.  Which probably means you're a direct descendant from Melody.&quot; <p>Mary Rose<br>

I'm just a writer who makes things up.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Now the rest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Melody laughed.  &quot;Great.  I'm happy about that.'<br>
<br>
&quot;There's more.&quot;  Rommie turned to Harper.  &quot;Your DNA was a 75% match.  So you're related not only to Melody but to Beka too.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harper was stunned.  &quot;Yeah, O.K.  Whatever.'<br>
<br>
Beka looked positively sick.  &quot;It's true then.  No.  It can't be.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We checked over and over again.  We're sure&quot;, Trance told her.  <br>
<br>
&quot;O.K.&quot;  Beka straightened up.  No need to lose it here and upset everyone.  Besides Melody looked really happy and even if she was dumb she still had feelings.  Beka didn't want to hurt them.  She walked over to Melody and patted her shoulder.  &quot;So, I guess we're related.  That's nice.'<br>
<br>
Melody's eyes lit up.  &quot;Isn't it?  She turned to the gang.  &quot;This is great.'<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen, I have to go.  There are things on the Maru that I have to do.  I'l catch you later.&quot;  She hurried off.<br>
<br>
The Andromeda crew knew her well enough to know that she was really upset.  Dylan sighed.  &quot;I was afraid of this.  I'd better got talk to her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot;  Tyr spoke up.  &quot;I will.  Dylan looked at him strangely; they all did.  &quot;As someone who understands  and appreciates the value of genes and familial relationships I am best qualified to counsel her.  So, I shall.&quot;  He left no room for arguement.<br>
