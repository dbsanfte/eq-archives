Cynthia walked down the street, anxiously wanting to get home, she looked at the people around and saw them all gaping at the comic book store. Noone ever paid that any attention so why were they no-.<br>
&quot;What the hell?&quot; She said, looking down, her shoe felt like it had been submerged in gum, warm gum, but now, as she looked down she saw it was the, sidewalk. How in hell? She sighed, and sat down at an angle so she wouldn't sprain  anything, and tried to take it out. Today was not her day. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:verdana;font-size:large;">&quot;In the end is my beginning&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

Cynthia looked as all the people a round started to run. She shrugged, this city was always weird as hell. The shoe was useless, whatever it was, her shoe was now stuck in the goo until someone with a jackhammer pried the whole block out of the ground. She carefully undid her laces, and stood up, regretfully looking at her shoe, then turned around, and bumped into something, or someone. She backed up a few paces to see the people who had approached her on the street home.<br>
&quot;You guys are persistent eh.&quot; She sighed. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:verdana;font-size:large;">&quot;In the end is my beginning&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

<br>
&quot;Oh God, Kevin....&quot; he said to himself. <br>
<br>
Just then he looked up and saw his last living friend, Cynthia. She was laying on the floor, lifeless. Behind her were two dark figures walking away. He ran up to her and knelt beside her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cynthia....&quot; he called to her. &quot;Cynthia!&quot; he cried.<br>
<br>
He put his fingers against her neck. Her pulse was slowing down. He pulled his hand away and looked at his fingers. There was a small trace of blood on them. He looked to her neck and saw two small puncture wounds where the blood was comming from.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the f*ck is this?!&quot; he shouted loudly. <br>
<br>
Just then he remembered the two shadowy figures. He called out to them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did youse guys see who did this?!&quot;<br>
<br>
They kept walking.<br>
<br>
'HEY I'M TALKING TO YOU!&quot; he screamed to the two figures. <br>
<br>
They kept walking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok f*ck this!&quot; he said to himself.<br>
<br>
He ran up to them and put his hand on Gabriel's shoulder. Gabriel's hand grabbed his and started to crush it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhh! F*ck leggo!&quot; he said to Gabriel as Jay started to attack Gabriel with his free hand. Just then Gabriel's free hand shot at Jay's stomach. The blow knocked the wind from him and he imidiatley started to fall. Gabriel let go off his hand and Jay hit the ground. Jay looked up to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;F*ck you, you lousy lil circus b*tch!&quot; he said to Gabriel, trying to catch his breath. Gabriel kicked Jay in the ribs and Jay's face turned white. The pain was so intense Jay almost passed out. Gabriel bend down and lifted Jay up by his collar.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have quite a mouth on you child.&quot; Gabriel said calmly. Jay spit in Gabriel's face. Gabriel's other hand grabbed Jay by the throat and began to choke him. Just as Jay was about to lose consciousness, Gabriel swung his limp body into a nearby building. He hit the wall with a loud thump. His body slid down the wall and slummped against it. The two figures faded away into the darkness. Jay looked over to where the comic book store once was then to his only friend Cynthia, who was lying motionless in the street.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kevin.... Cynthia....&quot; Jay said to himself then passed out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chococow>Choco Cow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 416<br> <font color=#8B0000>(4/6/03 10:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On the road to Oblivion</span><hr size=1> Cassandra laughed as Gabriel walked back to her. <br>

&quot;We should take her with us.&quot;<br>
&quot;WHY?&quot; Cassandra said, spinning around to face him.<br>
&quot;Because, we are looking for a companion, right. She, I think, would be perfect, she doesn't have any friends, and did you feel her at the school, she has something inside of her.......not a power, just something that calls to you.&quot; He said calmly. Cassandra closed her eyes. <br>
