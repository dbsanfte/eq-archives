<br>
1) If we were all vegetarians and food was shared equally, the planet could easily support 6 billion people. If we followed the average diet of a north american, that number would be reduced to 2.5 Billiion.<br>
<br>
2) The nuber of people who can be fed from 10 acres of land: 10 people on a diet of Maize; 24 people on a diet of Wheat; 2 people on a diet of cattle meat.<br>
<br>
3) food imports to the UK are in fact unneccessary, Our farm land is productive enough to support 250 billion people. <br>
<br>
4) the food producers monopoly is more than oil producers. Guess why the government does not encourage diet change???<br>
<br>
With millions of children starving every year (about 1 every 10 seconds, as you read), of which every single one could be fed, why don't we change?? <br>
I am not talking vegetarianism here- I am talking veganism. Do you really want me to tell you the health reasons for changing your diet?? (like how much of cows milk is made up of pus). Many studies have linked cancer with a diet high in animal foods, we all know they are not good for us. As for milk, after infancy our bodies no longer make the enzymes we need to digest milk sugar (ie Lactose), which is often the cause of allergies. <br>
Okay, notice here, I am leaving the debatable subject of animal welfare well out of reach. Why are we not changing our diets? Why are we causing so many deaths due to tradition? Why are we so damn blind?????????<br>

<br>
I don't know if its actually true that farming does destory the land. I very much doubt your ability to prove this to people. It not only creates good people but a livelihood.<br>
<br>
By stopping people from eating meat, it would have the same effect as Foot&amp;Mouth did, or when Thatcher closed down the coal mines! It would be disasterous right now, in other words.<br>

I would strongly contest that. Perhaps it should read million, not billion. :P Even then... I would find it rather exagerated, but believeable.<br>

These are some significant reasons to become vegetarian. If you care virtually nothing for animals, that's fine. Vegetarianism does not always have to be about animal rights and love of animals as it is often seen exclusively to be; this kind of research shows that vegetarianism can be about love for humanity as well. So vegetarianism can also be for the many who believe human welfare is more important than animal welfare... Because not only is it a healthier diet for most people (if you eat correctly and balance), if it becomes widespread enough it could help ensure that our resources don't dwindle as quickly, and that humankind could potentially survive for longer sustained by this planet. Idealism? Probably. But the more people that decide to have a vegetarian lifestyle, the better it can be for so many aspects of life.<br>

Oh dear, didn't know that. *puke*. Ahem. Anyway... Veganism can be a good concept, however it tends to be much less realistic than vegetarianism and here's why... For one, human development relies heavily on calcium from milk and protein from eggs, etc. Many people would not be willing to give up their precious fatty foods even when confronted with such compelling evidence such as possible heart disease and cancer. Also, veganism requires much more work to maintain diet and nutrition. There are supplements and such out there, but let's face it, people are lazy in general. I can't even remember to take a daily vitamin, let alone figure out the supplements for all that I need in my diet which I would not be getting from milk and egg products. People would have to be pretty informed and educated on the subject of nutrition in order to eat healthily on that sort of diet, or else some might end up in a worse situation than if they had been eating tons of milk and cheese et cetera all their lives. Malnutrition is always a significant concern, and it tends to be pretty common in vegans and often even vegetarians. It's a heavy personal decision that has to be carefully considered... And most of the world does not seem ready for veganism. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003399><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/udashofmooo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dash Of Mooo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.users.dialstart.net/~dashland/html/Strobe.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www.users.dialstart.net/~dashland/html/lene1c.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Moooo!!<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-vip.gif /></span><br>  Posts: <b>432</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#99CCFF>Posted: 9/19/02 11:40:58 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: You are what you eat??</span><hr size=1> Here we go, I'll give it a go. It's a big issue though - and I wont cover all of it.<br>
<br>
First of all - I believe very much that we should live as we were intented as much as that is possible. From our teeth, we are most definetly omnivores - hence we eat both plants and animal. I think that alone, is enough justification against forcing people to become vegans.<br>
<br>
The next issue is our moral and ethical responsibility to the rest of the world. Your right, there are millions if not billions of people starving with thousands dying every day. I don't contest it, but I refuse to accept that it is as a direct consequence of western diets. At the present moment, I believe(although I may be wrong) we produce enough food to feed every soul on earth adequately. So why don't we? Logistically we cannot share out the food. It's too difficult getting the food to the people who need it most.<br>
<br>
So why don't they produce it themselves?<br>
<br>
This links to another point which I believe in very strongly. We may claim that with a change to veganism we can feed more people, but I feel that is wrong. I already feel that the human population is placing too much of a burden on the environment and actually believe(its twisted I admit) that poverty,hunger and diseases such as AIDS are trying to keep our population in check. This doesn't mean I want people to die, it means I would rather see the earth reach a sustainable level of population. The population levels we are reaching for (by UN estimates) are utterly unsustainable and will give rise to the host of problems outlined in the article you posted in the second reply.<br>
<br>
In fairness, I totally reject the arguments put forward attributing the way we eat to world poverty. Completely.<br>
<br>
There are other issues of course.<br>
Our Health for instance, I agree has much to do with what and how we eat. Again however I refuse to accept that a vegan diet is better for us then a moderate and balanced meat containing diet. Of course fast food isn't healthy, nor is the british obsession with bacon, sausage and whatever else - but to completely miss out on healthy well prepared meat I feel can do as much harm as good.<br>
The Environment is another issue on which these campaigns focus. Again I must disagree to a major extent. It's not our eating habits that fuel the overproduction of our land - It's goverment policy. Even then - its not only due to this. In the American and Canadian prarie lands, soil erosion is a well known problem. Quite often the simplest cause to blame is just to say its overproduction. But lets look at the British farming scene, which has been going on for centuries longer, and still produces almost three times the average yield that they do in North America. Yet we hear precious little about soil erosion in this country, mainly because its not a problem. We manage and care for the land better because it is more valuable an asset then in other countries, and as a result are able to produce more without putting it at risk. People need to be educated around the world in better farming practices(perhaps organic, perhaps with the help of GM).<br>
<br>
The only industry I would say may benefit from less consumption is the fishing industry. We are dangerously overfishing the seas, and unlike agricultural land - there is no easy way for us to manage and control its quality. There are no quick fixes, and solutions may be dangerous on a global scale due to the turbulous nature of the sea, whereas on land activity will always be restricted to small areas.<br>
<br>
I've written far too much already, but have so much more to say.<br>
<br>
But as you can guess Veganism, isn't for me.<br>

Of course everyone views things differently, and that's just my take on it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But I agree with Dash that everyone simply going vegetarian or vegan wouldn't solve the hunger/poverty dilemma.

Anyhow, I want to put the theory to you, why can't we transport food to the poor people of this world. I am surprised that we can't get more food transported to African and other starving nations. Does anyone have any comments on why we can't get more, even with the navy merchant ships or something? Of course not all food could be moved, but alot could. Starving people aren't usually fussy.<br>

that I was vegetarian since birth. I did guess that you might be  a vegetarian <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Littlelisa: You fall prey to common MYTH number one, calcium is in no way a problem<br>
for vegans, dark green vegetables, soya, seeds grains and nuts are plentiful source<br>
If you stop and think about drinking cows milk, you will realise just how unnatrual it actually<br>
is: There is no dispute over our insides NOT being made to take this stuff. This is infants<br>
milk, specificly made for calves... just like our milk is made for our young.<br>
I do not take any sort of supplements- in fact I am am no more concerned about nutrition<br>
than anyone else, I eat the usual three meals a day... and there is even ice- cream! <br>
Believe me, veganism is not a sacrifice! Having said that it was at first, and you do tend<br>
to be over conscious of, *oh no whats in this??* but it sets in, and supermarkets are<br>
so much better than they used to be.<br>
Another thing, don't get me wrong, I do care about animal welfare, I was just trying to <br>
show the alternative view <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Dash: (this will be long!!!). I agree we are not like herbivores, obvoiusly we can't live on grass!<br>
The pattern of organs in our bodies and the composition of our blood are identical <br>
(more or less hehe) of those of the great apes - chimpanzees gorillas etc - . early man was probably not the violent hunter of common belief, and probably undertook the <br>
canivorous diet because of violent climate change, the migration north, and the dissapearance of plant cover (ice age related). Well, I could give you the details, but I'll just say we are made like frugivorous apes; Not like carnivors at all.<br>
<br>
How can the people in the poorer parts of the world produce it themselves???? With things like drout in their every day lives? The farmers among them are mostly controlled by large corporations, growing &quot;cash&quot; crops... it is a vicious circle. Places like the Sahara desert are getting bigger due to over grazing... I am interested in your strong viewpoints, I shall have to get more info to set up ammunition <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
I totally disagree with you over health, no we can not have a balanced healthy meat diet. As I tried to prove earlier, it is not neccessary let alone health or natrual. Take a look in you local factory farm, its shocking that we think healthy food can be produced in such a place. It really sickens me.   <br>
<br>
Actually I eat almost completely organic food as well as <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I tell you though I have a normal diet- I eat normal food! I don't watch vitamin intake, I never worry about nutrition, and I am perfectly heathly ( that goes for this half of my family as well).<br>
<br>
Dash- do tell us more of your views! <br>
<br>
Okay, thats enough of me for now...<br>

I'm a bit slower now..lol..hard work all this thinking.<br>
<br>
Here we go.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> early man was probably not the violent hunter of common belief<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again I disagree. Without sounding like a complete geek - I wrote an essay on early man, and more precisely the role it played in the big game extinctions. Of course the conclusions are debateable but I think man was a meat only eater in those days before he was forced to adapt to a more sedentary lifestyle. Of course it depends how far back you go because of course the great apes eat plants(although cannibalism has been noted in chimps). I was desperate to give you the essay(mainly because im rather proud of it *gloat*), but I cant seem to find it anywhere on my pc. Perhaps once im back at uni ill find it on my disk space there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How can the people in the poorer parts of the world produce it themselves???? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think here you may have misunderstood me here or muddled up different points(thats probably my fault though..lol).  In the current environment those people cannot support themselves. Sahara is getting bigger etc.etc. Your completely right. My point though was, that with more advanced and new farming techniques it may be quite feasible to support the populations. I apreciate this isn't possible without money though.  Imagine having the British farming industry set up in Africa? The world would drown under the food produced. Its wishfull thinking with the damage already done - but we are talking pretty theoretically here anyway. Look @ Mesopotamia. From the most productive piece of land on the planet to now being a near desert. Mismanagement.<br>
<br>
With regards to modern farming - well I see your point. As you may have guessed my dad is closely involved in the farming industry. I've seen the bad sides(I daren't reveal) but in fairness I've also seen enough that makes me fairly certain that the food I eat is safe. I'm not a great organic fan because, although I apreciate its theoretical advantages, I have seen what goes on. I'm not trying to produce scare stories but too me food produced by non-organic means are as safe as organics. Thats a personal opinion of course though. As is the judgement of what you see in the animal rights campaign horror videos on chicken farming, is actually like that everywhere.<br>
<br>
I'm no nutrition expert...and I really cant say I think what you say is wrong with regards to meat. I do still believe though, that everything in moderation is fine. Meat, sugar, alcohol..whatever. I like to think (with the exception of my student binge drinking), I live a healthy lifestyle.<br>
<br>
Hey..thats not bad for having a sore head.<br>
<br>
Like I said before ... good discussion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Your essay sounds interesting, I always loved history <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Okay, lets not argue about that because everything we say is based on assumption- more or less.<br>
I know that the horror movies that Animal welfare groups put out are extreme... However I have had first hand experience- I live on a farm. I have also heard first hand stories (from a meat eater!) from soemone who worked in a slaughter house. Meat the way it is produced to day is unhealthy. Milk, cows milk, on the other hand where does that come into it? Why are we drinking this stuff?<br>
World hunger is a major problem, they will be no one solution. My nutrition info I can assure you is from good sources <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyway, must go...<br>
By the way, never take any offence from what I say, I have only good intentions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I would like to search for a vegan who is fat, as I believe as a vegetarian I don't get the proper things I need and I probably would have a bit more muscles if I ate some meat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  lol<br>
I imagine that as a vegan, you would be thin. Would you tell us what you eat in one day? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/hat.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Do you ever go to specialist restuarants?

Okay what do I eat in a day? Usually:<br>
Toast for breakfast<br>
Pasta, Macaroni cheese or beans on toast for lunch.<br>
 Dinner is usually something with vegetables, but we have things like pizza too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
I sometimes eat chocolate and other sweet things too (homemade chocolates cakes yummmmmmmyy!!) Its hard to say beacause it can be so different from day to day.<br>
<br>
I never really eat out, I was put off restaurants quite a while ago- Hygiene above all else put me off.  Eating out usually means bringing sandwiches <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/lol.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But you get used to it. There is one specialist restaurant in Swansea I have seen so far, but I've never been there.<br>
Is it just you, or your family too, who are vegetarian?<br>
<br>
Jeeeeezz I just wrote a lot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/lol.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
