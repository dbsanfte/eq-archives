Actually, I think it's sad when kids grow up under such strict religious notions.  I have a good friend that was telling me not so long ago about his upbringing being like this.  It caused him to go wild for a while when he finally got out of his parent's house, and to seriously question church doctrine (which is a good thing, but sad when it happens this way I think)  Thankfully, he is a Christian, although has debunked many of the 'rules' he grew up with.<br>

How are your views different now from what you grew up with in Protestant churches? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brendamj>brendamj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#B87333>(8/4/03 6:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Denominations: Your history?</span><hr size=1> Hello heartjoys<br>
<br>
On the Lord's Supper, I always thought that the division was between symbol and sacrament. I could not accept  the sacrament side but was never happy with the symbol one either as I felt that it had to have a deeper significance than just symbol. It seemed to me to be somthing that was very important indeed.<br>
<br>
I have come to see the deeper significance of it now. Jesus came to put an end to all 'outward' things that were religion for the Jews. Even the place where God would dwell was now inward and not in a temple made with stones. He now will dwell within the hearts of His people if they will be consecrated to Him alone and turn from all idols or anything that puts itself in the place of God, and this is the real communion. We are to feed on Him by FAITH, on His flesh and blood so that they or His sacrifice are where we obtain our substance for life. It is typified in the garden of Eden when the tree of life was to be the food of Adam and Eve but they chose to feed from the other tree instead and lost their lives (spiritual communion with God)<br>
<br>
Feeding on Him in this way is a constant thing not like the old Jewish ceremony of communion or Passover. It was in place as a picture of what was to come in Chirst.<br>
<br>
During the NT period, believers did carry on with their Jewish ceremonies even circumcision (which was to be the circumcision of the heart) for a while.<br>
<br>
For the communion the Lord held however, He said that it was to 'show forth His death' until He came again to the disciples and He did so three days after he died when He arose from the dead and returned to them.<br>
<br>
Seeing it in this way is a very serious thing indeed and requires one to live only for the Lord rather than think of having ceremonies or special days or special places to worship Him which was part of the Old Covenant.<br>
<br>
Seeing communion in this way has been a very liberating thing for me and has deepened my relationship with the Lord, knowing that He dwells within me and that everything in my life must be conformed to Him so that His holy communion with me will not be interupted or compromised in any way rather than partake in physical objects to remind myself of His sacrifice every now and again. Now I do not have to remind myself but live the knowledge of it day by day minute by minute.<br>

Yeah, it's the service that attracts me too.  And, reading your post makes me realize how different my views are now from just 5 or 6 years ago!  I am glad that you've found a church home where you really 'fit in'!  That's a great feeling and service.<br>

Sometimes it seems to me that having so many denominations is a bad thing because of the various doctrines, but also, I can't help but believe that we are gifted with many denominations so that various personalities can worship according to their style.<br>

<br>
Just missed your last post and your question about Quakerism.<br>
<br>
There are three main divisions. One is liberal and may or may not include belief in Christ. Another is Evangelical and includes some Protestant beliefs and practices. And the third is Conservative which aims to be the same as the faith and practice of the early Quakers led by George Fox who turned England upside down in the 17th century.<br>
<br>
George Fox taught against both Protestant and Catholic doctrines and practices. The main thing is as I have said in my last post ie that Christ came to end all 'outward religion' and brought in a religionless Christianity which I have now come to think of as being the closest to the early church and the purest teaching since then.<br>
<br>
He was against 'steeple houses' and 'hireling priests' and said that freely we are given so freely should we give and not make gain from preaching the gospel and gave the example of apostle Paul who supported himself as much as possible. He said that giving to the ministry is to be free will without co-ersion and went to prison frequently because he stood against the tithing by law practices of the time.<br>
<br>
He believed that a true minister will be taught by God and not go to colleges for training by men and gave the example of the early church. He said that Christ came to teach His people Himself without man coming in between.<br>
<br>
But most of all he said that we are to be holy people and that Christ gives the power to be so if we are willing to turn from sin. He also thought that women could minister (though not be a leader of a church which he thought was not scriptural anyway)<br>
<br>
To me, this type of faith, being simple and directly related to Christ seemed much more understandable and I particularly like the idea of a service that was completely led by the Holy Spirit so that if no-one was inspired then the meeting was silent before the Lord.<br>
<br>
Hope that explains it<br>

i was excited to be with other people who believed and knew more about something then i did. there wasnt a person who showed me about jesus. i worked at a horse stable and there was a bible in the office. i started reading it when i i had time. starting at the beginning! but i skipped alot. i couldnt figure out why people were christians until i got to the NT. there was alot that jesus taught that was close to beliefs i already had. and once i understood what happened to him it made sense to me. <br>
<br>
it took a few months of reading.<br>
<br>
i liked being alone and driving that distance in the morning...there were a few times i rode my horse there too. that was when i got caught by my mother!! she heard me getting him ready. so i had to tell her where i was going. <br>

it has only been that way in churches i went to here in the east. the ones back home arent like that. the worse time was when my daughter was in her  sunday school group and she was showing some of the children her little 'indian dance' and telling about the ribbon in her hair. (which is a ribbon worn in traditional ceremonies...its something i wear too for church...and a feather..its small..mixed in with my hair and not real noticable). the teacher didnt have a problem really but other parents who saw it told her to stop and complained. its not like she was waving a tomahawk and callling on spirits! she was wearing a regular dress...it was her little worship dance.<br>
<br>

the group known as &quot;Quakers&quot; is more formally known as<br>
&quot;Society of Friends.&quot; <br>
The nickname &quot;quakers&quot; came from their particular style of<br>
prayer at the time, where the pray-er moved back and<br>
forth, or 'quaked'.   Another group was given the nickname<br>
&quot;shaking quakers&quot; (the &quot;Shakers&quot;.) <br>
<br>
I heard of non-Christian quakers a few months back.<br>
Does not compute for me, but it makes sense to them, so<br>
there you go.<br>
<br>
I took an online quiz once, that supposedly shows what<br>
religion your beliefs are closest to.<br>
The closest Christian group I got was Quaker.<br>
<br>
Then again, I had a 100% correlation, I think, with<br>
&quot;conservative Jew&quot;, so that tells you how accurate the<br>
results were. (I think Muslim was a close second for me.)<br>

all forms of fun.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Here's some of my own personal history:<br>
(as much as I'm willing to share with the group)<br>
<br>
I was raised Roman Catholic, in a Roman Catholic family.<br>
At age 12, I was nearly killed.  Reviewing the incident <br>
convinced me that God existed (too many improbable things<br>
stacked up to insure I'd make a full recovery), but it left me<br>
with many questions that I was certain my upbringing left<br>
me ill-equipped for.  My own education had led me to <br>
believe that if Catholicism did not have the answers I was<br>
looking for, then NO Christian would. So, I spent the next<br>
few years essentially as a monotheist, looking for answers.<br>
Eventually, God sent a search party for me.  (When the<br>
time was right.) <br>

<br>
&quot;The nickname &quot;quakers&quot; came from their particular style of<br>
prayer at the time, where the pray-er moved back and<br>
forth, or 'quaked'. Another group was given the nickname<br>
&quot;shaking quakers&quot; (the &quot;Shakers&quot;.)&quot;<br>
<br>
The Shakers were a totally different group to Quakers even though sometimes it is stated that the movement started as a split from Quakerism. There were lots of small groups like the Shakers, some were completely antinomian. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/Shakers.html">religiousmovements.lib.vi...akers.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Quakers were given their name because they stressed fear of God and obedience to Him and were only associated with other groups like the Seekers who joined them and swelled the ranks greatly, who were also searching for the answer which drove Fox to wander England speaking to many ministers, as to how a believer can be obedient, when he found in himself something which fought against it. He found the answer when God spoke to Him and went on to teach it bringing a great revival (which has been seen at other times through history when others taught the same thing ie entire sanctification) <br>
<br>
I consider Shakers nothing like the early Quakers, who unfortunately soon started to admit error once George Fox died. Legalism had also come in even though it was condemned by Fox's wife, so I think this is why you think:-<br>
<br>
&quot;'ve never understood the &quot;Christians aren't allowed to have<br>
fun&quot; people. I'm not too sure how many people would be<br>
interested in a God that had a vested interest in denying you<br>
all forms of fun.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am sure that they would never have laid down laws like this. It is a personal decision between us and God on what things we decline from in this life to enable us to spend more time with God and in study. But then it depends on what someone calls fun. Playing games with one's children etc is innocent fun to me, but if one spends too much of one's time like this then it has become unbalanced, and harmful to spiritual growth but again it is between one person and God. <br>
<br>
I agree with you about the non-Christian Quakers. A lot of liberals etc are attracted by the Peace Testimony of the early Quakers and their insistance that everyone was treat equally including the mentally insane who they were first to help. <br>

I was raised in the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, and it's important for me to keep the distinction in the synods as the LCMS, WELS, and ELCA are not easily lumped into one sum.<br>
I kinda drifted from my faith from junior high through high school. Not that I totally abandoned it, but comming right out of a Lutheran elementary school, I was surprised to see how &quot;free&quot; the other kids seemed to behave and it was attractive to me. Needless to say, I did some very unChristian-like things during that time.<br>
Thanks to places like Philisophia Christi, and the people there though, my faith has been rekindled from a candle to a bonfire, and I don't see myself ever leaving the LCMS.<br>
My girlfriend, on the other hand, is a Methodist, and it has been quite a struggle to correct her misunderstandings about the Lutheran church, e.g. she believes that Lutherans think they are the only ones going to heaven, etc...<br>

<br>
<br>
I'm adopted, I was adopted at the age of about two months.  The only request of my birthmother was that I go to an Episcopalian family.  I was raised in a good, conservative, highly liturgical Episcopal church in Massachusetts (what? a conservative Episcopal church in MA??? lol, I think we're one of a VERY small amount...) and I've served the church in every way a lay person under the age of twenty can serve.  I've been a torch bearer, a crucifer, a thurifer, in the choir(s), in the altar guild, helped my mom in the flower guild, helped my mom's administrative duties (mainly stuffing bulletins and mailings), been an officer every year I was in the youth group, leading up to being the president, and last but CERTAINLY not least being a subdeacon.  If any of those terms (subdeacon, crucifer, thurifer, etc) mean anything to you...<br>
<br>
Upon going to college, I had some falling-away issues.  Namely, I didn't have a car, and I didn't really know any Christians, let alone Christians with cars who would take me to church with them.  I attended InterVarsity Christian Fellowship's opening-of-the-year service and put my name on the list, mainly out of habit (church has always been something I did) but nobody from IVCF followed up on that, and I didn't really hear anything about them until VERY late in the year.  Finally, I started getting really interested in this great Mennonite guy and we started going out and therefore I went with him (he had a car! hehe) to church at an interdenominational church with a heart for world missions.  The style of worship was so different and refreshing, and I saw passion in the believers there.  Then of course I started going to large groups with him, and thanks to meeting friends at large group, someone learned which dorm I lived in and bugged me to get involved in the small group Bible studies.<br>
<br>
These were all the things I was used to--Bible studies, and the fun large group stuff that reminded me of my old youth group.  I was rather thankful that I finally got involved with IV and into a church!  But our chapter of IVCF just HAD to do something about the way it followed up on NSO events (new student outreach)--and for that matter all outreach events.<br>
<br>
It's now my third year here.  I've really only been involved with IVCF for about a year, but I'm on the exec team.  It's kinda cool.  I'm psyched about this coming year, and the ways God seems to be headed with the lost on campus.  Most of the people in IVCF would probably be scared by the amount of liturgy at my home church.  But that's one of the things I love most (and miss most) about home--there is so much beautiful tradition.  (Of course, all too often, passion for tradition takes the place of passion for God...but that's another topic...)<br>
<br>
Anyways, I don't know how much longer I'll be an Episcopalian.  Either my parish and others who disagree with recent decisions will split, or I may just become Lutheran and marry this guy (as a friend of mine suggested...I laughed at it, since we're not even going out, but I think my friend was serious...)<br>
<br>
The only problem I had with the local Lutheran church was they didn't let me take communion with them.  *feels left out*  I still have to figure out the reasoning behind that...it might make sense eventually... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jebleez>Jebleez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sir Jeb,<br>Tone & Rhythm Man</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#B87333>(9/3/03 12:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://killeenroos.com/2/battle2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Denominations: Your history?</span><hr size=1> Hey NS!<br>

<br>
This is the Missouri Synod Lutheran Church's stance on the subject, but you'll find the other Lutheran synods have a very similar position:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So it is not that a Lutheran congregation wants to bar fellow-saints from the blessings of the Eucharist when they practice Close Communion. It is not that they want to be separatistic,or set themselves up as judges of other men.The practice of Close Communion is prompted by love and is born of the heartfelt conviction,on the basis of Scripture alone,that we must follow Christ’s command.This means refusing the Lord’s Supper to those whose belief is not known to us. It is not showing love to allow a person to do something harmful,even though he may think it is for his own good. It also means if they are members of a Christian body which departs from the full truth of the Scripture in some of its doctrines, that we must not minimize the evil of this false teaching by opening our fellowship to any and all Christians who err in the faith<br>
Close communion seeks to prevent a profession of confessional unity in faith where there is,in fact,disunity and disagreement. “In keeping with the principle that the celebration and reception of the Lord’s Supper is a confession of the unity of faith, while at the same time recognizing that there will be instances when sensitive pastoral care needs to be exercised, the Synod has established an official practice requiring,‘that pastors and congregations of The Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod,except in situations of emergency and in special cases of pastoral care,commune individuals of only those synods that are now in fellowship with us.By following this practice whereby only those individuals who are members of the Synod or of a church body with which the Synod is in altar and pulpit fellowship are ordinarily communed,pastors and congregations preserve the integrity of their witness to the Gospel of Christ as it is revealed in the Scriptures and confessed in the Lutheran confessional writings.<br>
The Office of the Keys is less than faithfully exercised when admission to the Sacrament is granted to all who come to the altar regardless of their faith and congregational and/or denominational affiliation.The practice of open Communion renders it difficult,if not impossible,for church discipline to be exercised in a way that honors the ministrations being carried out by those to whom the responsibility of spiritual care for a member of God’s flock has been entrusted.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

That's basically what the little pamphlet in the back of the pew said, and it makes some sense.  You want people to be taking communion because they are true believers, not because they think theyr'e supposed to or whatever.  But I also saw something on it about the belief that the bread and wine/grape juice actually BECOMES the body and blood...and that kinda creeped me out...I mean, I'm alright with the symbolism, and how it becomes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>for us</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the body and blood of Jesus, but...actually physically turning into flesh and blood?  That's kinda creepy.  Is that just me misunderstanding the pamphlet, or is it something I just didn't think Lutherans did??  I was confused.  I dunno.

Lutherans don't believe that the body and blood are physically there, but that they are present in the wine and bread. The view that you are talking about is called transubstantiation.<br>

To be more precise, we want to make sure people who are partaking aren't flying blind into the situation. It's not right to be taking communion when you don't understand what is happening. And as other denominations believe different things about it, we prefer to have a closed communion. <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession.
