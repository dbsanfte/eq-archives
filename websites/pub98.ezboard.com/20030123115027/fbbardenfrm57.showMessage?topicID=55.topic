<br>
For clarity, a theatre in Moscow was taken over by some 30 Chechen rebels armed with large amounts of explosives and weapons. They demanded Russia to pull forces out of Chechnya and for Chechen independence, or they would kill everyone in the building. A few hostages here and there were released, some were executed. In the end, the theatre was stormed by the Russian Army (who are notorious for killing everyone in a hostage situation), and the hostages released.<br>
<br>
Do you think that this situation was handled well?<br>
<br>
I, personally, do not think it was. There were petty efforts to be diplomatic about the situation, and I agree with the rebels in that I don't think that Russia needs to occupy Chechen territory, and should acknowledge their desire to be a free nation. I think that the Russian Army was simply lucky to make (mostly) good of this situation.<br>
<br>

I guess it depends on your views of the bigger picture.<br>
<br>
I don't know if the situation was handled well. 750 people could have died. It looks like 90 did. 750 people could have survived, only 660 did. It depends how you look at it.<br>
<br>
Hostage situations in recent times have been handled much like plane hi-jackings. In general you do not negotiate with them(the hijackers), as was found out to the worlds cost in the 1970's n 80's. Negotiations meant that it looked like hijackings would work, and would encourage more to start doing it. The same was being applied to big hostage situations. If we chose to still adopt this course of action(which I think we should) then the Russian special agencies did as expected, and took action as soon as it needed to be taken.<br>
The current world take on terrorism is that you don't tolerate it. And in Moscow it wasn't.<br>
<br>
The Chechnian situation is perhaps a different topic, and again I must side with the current Russian government. You can't just allow a small area to just declare independance and then continue guerilla action untill its independance is recognised. If we did, then the Basque's would have their own country. The Palestinians would have Israel back. Northern Ireland would be part of Ireland again. And hundreds of other small groups would resort to violence and terrorism because there was something to be gained.<br>
<br>
This doesn't mean I aprove of the action and the way in which the action was/has taken by Moscow. But you cant seriously expect them to allow every minority their own country, and especially not for them too terrorise your own non-disputed territory.<br>

As far as I know they do have some type of democratically elected government controlled at large by the Russians, and the terrority is controlled by the Russian Army. As far as I also know, nothing much has changed at all since the Soviet empire days. Chechnya has not improved, the attention it seeks is ignored, and the independance the majority of its citizens want is refused by Russia.<br>
<br>
Russia believes it can look after the country better than it being independant. This may be true, but if the people it (I don't know if they do) then they should get full independance.<br>
To compare it to N Ireland or the west bank is simple absurd in my own opinion. Each situation must be looked at differently. The biggest murder in N Ireland has of course been the Real IRA Omagh bombing - and the ongoing dispute in the west bank is simple old religious terrority being claimed by two governments, creating friction between nuclear powers.<br>
<br>
I think this whole hostage thing is different. I might not be proving my points very well as I am tired. Israel or Ireland has never had a situation like this; civilian hostages have never been kidnapped with such a large scale. 700+ people is literally amazing. These terorrists did not strike at military bases, they did not strike at government bodies. They didn't even strike at the army that are positioned in Chechnya. They reached such a point that they had no choice except to go to the center of a European city and capture almost 750 Russians. They hit the center of Russian life, and I have no idea how they ever managed it. If this had have been Washington, I know the security agencies would have more than enough questions to answer.<br>
<br>
The number of rebels is also being questionned. The news here made it clear it was around 50, where as Adam says 30. I think it will be a long time before any figure is said by the Russians. They may not even know themselves. They dragged half of them out onto the street leaving them dead, and some made it to hospital. There have been so many stories about the security at the hospital incase any terrorists escaped.<br>
<br>
There has also been one big story. The gas. Russians used gas that knocked everyone out before they could count to 1. We do not know of any gas that does this. Therefore the Russians must have had some type of gas kept from their old Soviet Cold War days. It is against treaties for them to use it, but in cases the Americans have used 'potions' that they shouldn't have to deal with emergencies.<br>
<br>
I am tired. I hope you can guess what I was going to say in the bits I left out!
