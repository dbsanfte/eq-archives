<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bashful</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  (I told you guys I was painfully shy...)<br>
<br>
Bashfuls are warm and kind-hearted, and want to believe the best in people. They value harmony and cooperation, and are likely to be very sensitive to other people's feelings. Bashfuls have a highly active fertile inner world that is not usually obvious to observers. They are constantly taking in information about people and situations that is personally important to them, and storing it for later use. This tremendous store of knowledge is usually amazingly accurate, because the Bashful personality has an exceptional memory about things that are important to their value systems. Some Bashfuls have been known to recall a particular facial expression or conversation in precise detail years after the event occurred, if the situation made an impression on Bashful. <br>
<br>
More so than other types, Bashfuls are attuned to their own internal feelings, as well as other people's feelings. They do not usually express their own feelings, keeping things inside. If they are negative feelings, they may build up inside Bashfuls until they turn into firm judgments against individuals which are difficult to unseed, once set. Bashfuls need to learn to express themselves, and find outlets for their powerful emotions. Under the apparent calm is a passionate person. <br>
<br>
Bashfuls are warm, generous, and dependable. They have many special gifts to offer, in their sensitivity to others, and their strong ability to keep things running smoothly. They need to remember to not be overly critical of themselves, and to give themselves some of the warmth and love which they freely dispense to others. <br>

(Clicking on the image or links below will take you to the details about this dwarf). <br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
 Happy<br>
<br>
However, please note that no one fits any one type perfectly. It's possible for someone to have feelings and thoughts which cut across several personalities. In reality, you'll never find a pure &quot;Happy&quot; or &quot;Doc&quot;. This is a simplified model which helps us quickly determine how someone MIGHT behave in a group situation, and the types of interventions which will make it most possible for that person to have a constructive group experience. But please know that we understand people aren't really that simple. Your personality (or that of the person you tested) is the one that describes the primary set of feelings and thoughts, the one with whom you (or the person whom the test was taken for) would most likely identify. You (or this other person) will probably not feel COMPLETELY identified with any. <br>
<br>
The personalities contain some exaggerations of the features being illustrated. We've done this to make them easy to recognize and identify with. They are much like the characters we meet in fables and children's stories. While we all know they don't exist in reality, there are important lessons to learn by examining those which most nearly approximate us. <br>

General Description of Sneezy Personality:<br>
Sneezies are quiet and reserved individuals who are interested in security and peaceful living. They have a strongly-felt internal sense of duty, which lends them a serious air and the motivation to follow through on tasks. They are organized and methodical in their approach. <br>
<br>
Sneezies take pride in their loyalty, faithfulness, and dependability. They place great importance on honesty and integrity. They are &quot;good citizens&quot; who can be depended on to do the right thing for their families and communities. While they generally take things very seriously, they also usually have an offbeat sense of humor and can be a lot of fun - especially at family or work-related gatherings. <br>
<br>
Sneezy respect laws and traditions, and expect the same from others. They're not comfortable with breaking laws or going against the rules. They tend to believe that things should be done according to procedures and plans. In a meeting, they may become overly obsessed with structure, and insist on doing everything &quot;by the book&quot;. <br>
<br>
Sneezy is extremely dependable on following through with things which he or she has promised. For this reason, they sometimes get more and more work piled on them. Because Sneezy has such a strong sense of duty, he may have a difficult time saying &quot;no&quot; when given more work than can reasonably be handled. <br>
<br>
Sneezy will work for long periods of time and put tremendous amounts of energy into doing any task which they see as important to fulfilling a goal. However, they will resist putting energy into things which don't make sense to them, or for which they can't see a practical application. They prefer to work alone. They like to be accountable for their actions, and enjoy being in positions of authority. Sneezy has little use for theory or abstract thinking, unless the practical application is clear. <br>
<br>
Sneezy also has tremendous respect for facts. They hold a tremendous store of facts within themselves, which they have gathered through their Sensing preference. They may have difficulty understanding a theory or idea which is different from their own perspective. However, if they are shown the importance or relevance of the idea to someone who they respect or care about, the idea becomes a fact, which Sneezy will internalize and support. Once Sneezy supports a cause or idea, he or she will stop at no lengths to ensure that they are doing their duty of giving support where support is needed. <br>
<br>
Sneezy's are not naturally in tune with their own feelings and the feelings of others. They may have difficulty picking up on emotional needs immediately, as they are presented. Being perfectionists themselves, they have a tendency to take other people's efforts for granted, like they take their own efforts for granted. They need to remember to pat people on the back once in a while. <br>
<br>
Sneezy's are likely to be uncomfortable expressing affection and emotion to others. However, their strong sense of duty and the ability to see what needs to be done in any situation usually allows them to overcome their natural reservations, and they are usually quite supporting and caring individuals with the people that they love. <br>
<br>
Sneezy is extremely faithful and loyal. Traditional and family-minded, they will put forth great amounts of effort at making their homes and families running smoothly. They are responsible parents, taking their parenting roles seriously. They are usually good and generous providers to their families. They care deeply about those close to them, although they usually are not comfortable with expressing their love. Sneezy is likely to express affection through actions, rather than through words. <br>
<br>
Sneezy's have an excellent ability to take any task and define it, organize it, plan it, and implement it through to completion. They are very hard workers, who do not allow obstacles to get in the way of performing their duties. They do not usually give themselves enough credit for their achievements, seeing their accomplishments simply as the natural fulfillment of their obligations. <br>
<br>
They are the first to notice distractions in the meeting room. <br>
<br>
Under stress, Sneezy may fall into &quot;catastrophe mode&quot;, seeing nothing but all of the possibilities of what could go wrong. They will berate themselves for things which they should have done differently, or duties which they failed to perform. They will lose their ability to see things calmly and reasonably, and will depress themselves with their visions of doom. In a meeting this may be externalized as complaints about group process or focussed on the test materials.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=consubstantial>consubstantial</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/examples/fhpp036.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/26/03 2:46:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heroicfool>HeroicFool</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://avatarshere.topcities.com/p/explosionwer.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#0000FF, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='user title'>Triumvir</span></td></tr></table>

They have a drive for leadership, which is well-served by their quickness to grasp complexities, their ability to absorb a large amount of impersonal information, and their quick and decisive judgments. They are &quot;take charge&quot; people. <br>
<br>
Docs are very career-focused, and fit into the corporate/medical/academic world quite naturally. They are constantly scanning their environment for potential problems which they can turn into solutions. They generally see things from a long-range perspective, and are usually successful at identifying plans to turn problems around - especially problems of a strategic nature. Docs are usually successful, because they are so driven to leadership. They're tireless in their efforts on the job, and driven to visualize where an organization is headed. For these reasons, they are natural leaders. <br>
<br>
There is not much room for error in the world of Doc. They dislike to see mistakes repeated, and have no patience with inefficiency. They may become quite harsh when their patience is tried in these respects, because they are not naturally tuned in to people's feelings, and more than likely don't believe that they should tailor their judgments in consideration for people's feelings. Docs have difficulty seeing things from outside their own perspective. Docs naturally have little patience with people who do not see things the same way as they do. Doc needs to consciously work on recognizing the value of other people's opinions, as well as the value of being sensitive towards people's feelings. In the absence of this awareness, Doc can be a forceful, intimidating and overbearing individual. <br>
<br>
Doc has a tremendous amount of personal power and presence which will work for hi m as a force towards achieving their goals. However, this personal power is also an agent of alienation and self-aggrandizement. <br>
<br>
Docs are very forceful, decisive individuals. They make decisions quickly, and are quick to verbalize their opinions and decisions to the rest of the world. A Doc who has developed in a generally less than ideal way may become dictatorial and abrasive - intrusively giving orders and direction without a sound reason for doing so, and without consideration for the people involved. <br>
<br>
Although Docs are not naturally tuned into other people's feelings, these individuals frequently have very strong sentimental streaks. Often these sentiments are very powerful to the Doc, although they will likely hide it from general knowledge, believing the feelings to be a weakness. Because the world of feelings and values is not where Doc naturally functions, they may sometimes make value judgments and hold onto submerged emotions which are ill-founded and inappropriate, and will cause them problems - sometimes rather serious problems. <br>
<br>
Docs love to interact with people. As Extroverts, they're energized and stimulated primarily externally. There's nothing more enjoyable and satisfying to Doc than having a lively, challenging conversation. They especially respect people who are able to stand up to them, and argue persuasively for their point of view. There aren't too many people who will do so, however, because Doc is a very forceful and dynamic presence who has a tremendous amount of self-confidence and excellent verbal communication skills. Even the most confident individuals may experience moments of self-doubt when debating a point with a Doc. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes and no...<br>
<br>
I am very in tune to people's feelings, but I won't change what I have to say based on those feelings.<br>
<br>
The truth is the truth and I won't lie to protect someone's too fragile feelings.<br>
<br>
This is mostly my internet personality, in alot of ways I have  a split personality I guess...   In the real world I'm much more bashful, but I admit it...  I am moving more and more toward Doc all the time in real life. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
Happys are people persons - they love people. They are warmly interested in others and tend to watch, listen and pick up specific, detailed information about others. They want to like people, and have a special skill at bringing out the best in others. They are extremely good at reading others, and understanding their point of view. Happy's strong desire to be liked and to maintain a pleasant environment makes him highly supportive of others. People like to be around Happy, because he has a special gift of invariably making people feel good about themselves. <br>
<br>
Happys take responsibilities very seriously, and are very dependable. They value security and stability, and have a strong focus on the details of life. They see before others do what needs to be done, and do whatever it takes to make sure that it gets done. They enjoy these types of tasks, and are extremely good at them. <br>
<br>
Happys are warm and energetic. They need approval from others to feel good about themselves. They are hurt by indifference and don't understand unkindness. They are very giving people, who get a lot of their personal satisfaction from the happiness of others. They want to be appreciated for who they are, and what they give. They're very sensitive to others, and freely give practical care. Happys are such caring individuals, that they sometimes have a hard time seeing or accepting a difficult truth about someone they care about or themselves for that matter. That makes it difficult to express a difference of opinion that might be construed as negative by the leader or anyone else in the meeting. <br>
<br>
Happys are focused on reading other people. They have a strong need to be liked, and to be in control. You may observe them changing their own manner to be more pleasing to whoever they're with at the moment. <br>
<br>
Happys respect and believe in the laws and rules of authority, and believe that others should do so as well. They're traditional, and prefer to do things in the established way, rather than venturing into unchartered territory. Their need for security drives their ready acceptance and adherence to the policies of the established system. This tendency may cause them to sometimes blindly accept rules without questioning or understanding them. <br>
<br>
A Happy who has developed in a less than ideal way may be prone to being quite insecure, and focus all of their attention on pleasing others. <br>
<br>
Happys at their best are warm, sympathetic, helpful, cooperative, tactful, down-to-earth, practical, thorough, consistent, organized, enthusiastic, and energetic. They enjoy tradition and security, and will seek stable lives that are rich in contact with friends and family<br>
