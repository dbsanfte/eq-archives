Psychi walked into the room, her hands finally clean of the blood.<br>

Pyschi slowly put a finger near Setsuna's mouth, making sure she wasn't a &quot;biter&quot;.<br>
<br>
Setsuna suddenly yawned and stretched, her wings going to the full span of about 6 feet.<br>
<br>
Psychi jumped back, checking her hand. She sighed. &quot;Still there...&quot;<br>
<br>
Setsuna looked at  her oddly. &quot;Of course.. I don't bite. I'm not a biter.&quot;<br>
<br>
She noticed Aka staring at her wings, playing with a loose feather and giggling.<br>

&quot;Awwwwwww so cute...&quot; she said, kissing Setsuna on top of the head.<br>
<br>
Setsuna smiled. &quot;Really?&quot; she asked, tilting her head to the side. She'd never been called &quot;cute&quot; before...  she was used to hearing &quot;YOU MANGY MUTT!&quot; or something like that. She quickly decided it was probably better to stay in her kitten form for the time being, though she'd forgotten one important thing: animals didn't usually talk.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm Setsu-chan... who're you?!&quot; she asked, tilting her head the other way now and waiting for an answer. Her small, onix eyes remained focused on the girl. <p>&quot;I am a dreamer... don't take that from me...&quot;<br>

In the basement, it was dark and damp. Aka turned on a very dim light. Psychi looked around. There was a baby dragon in a cage on the other end of the basement. Everything was decorated in assorted reds, and there were a few skulls hanging arond.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, Psychi. Now tell me... was that koolaid, or blood?&quot; Aka asked, sitting down ontop of the only flat surface in the area, which was on the baby dragon's cage. It squawked.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was blood... you know if we let on that we kill someone infront of NORMAL people, that we could get sent to prison, or worse, executed. You need to be careful what you say infront of people, Aka.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I need to work on my espionage, too...&quot; she said, rubbing her chin thoughtfully. She pulled off her sunglasses and thought a moment.<br>

&quot;You know,&quot; Psychi laughed, &quot;The Angel of Death could very well be very pissed off at us.&quot; <br>
<br>
Aka laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You could be right. She could come swooping down here in the form of a little girl, to unsuspecting us... and kill us.&quot; she said. Psychi laughed again.<br>
<br>
&quot;And she'd look just like that little girl with the uneve pig tails and funky wings, probably.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah... and she could turn into animals...&quot;<br>
<br>
The two laughed for a while before they decided the joke was getting really old.<br>
<br>
&quot;So who did you kill?&quot; Aka asked, an excited twinkle in her eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;Misti.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You killed Misti? She's Dave's best, besides Sarra's little robot, Rana. Dave may be sending Rana after you next.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why can't he just do his own dirty work...&quot; Psychi sighed. She lifted the top of one of the trunks, and found many dismembered body parts. &quot;I see you've been busy...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh... that's just my cousins. They were calling me a freak and you know how that goes when you're evil with black magic...&quot; Aka said, waving a hand. Psychi smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can I feed these to the dragon?&quot; she asked. Aka nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's what I use it for anyway.&quot; she said with a giggle. Psychi giggled, too. She picked up a hand and walked over to the dragon. &quot;He's like a doggie. He'll eat it right out of your hand, and won't bite your fingers, or anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay.&quot; Psychi said, feeding the hand to the baby dragon.  <p>check out pics of my various characters!<br>

She quickly transformed into her little  girl form and grabbed her &quot;beeper&quot; from the waist-line of her skirt. She clicked a button and got a recent list of all the &quot;recently dead&quot; and how they died.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn...&quot; she muttered, seeing the long list of people and animals. &quot;Oh well... time to go to work...&quot; She replaced her bepper, got up, skipping down the stairs, hoping everyone had gone to bed already. She stopped when she saw the two women who'd let her in earlier that evening. They were talking to a couple of men whome she knew well for their various murders in the past.<br>
<br>
&quot;Greaaaaaaat...&quot; she mumbled. 'How am I going to get to work with them all awake and stuff?'<br>
<br>
&quot;So, where's the wierd little girl?&quot; She heard one of the men ask. <br>
<br>
She gasped and started racing  back up the stairs, but didn't quite make it.<br>
<br>
&quot;There she is! Little girl!&quot; Aka called, giggling.<br>
<br>
Setsuna cringed at the name. &quot;My name's Setsuna-chan,&quot; she said, putting on her happiest face, giggling. <p>Lotsa Luvs!<br>

A long, black sword appeared in her right hand as she extended her wings, flying down to where the two boys stood. &quot;Listen, you little punk! Part of my letting you live was that you weren't supposed to tell anyone what I was! Now... I have to kill you! I didn't want to, but you must die...&quot; she said, her voice no longer that of a little girl, but of a grown woman. She giggled, and raised the sword high in the air and brought it down, stopping mere centimeters from Raul's face. &quot;Now, give me a  reason you should live...&quot; she demanded, smiling evilly. <p>Lotsa Luvs!<br>
