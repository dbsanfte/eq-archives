<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">As a true hip-hopper, it is a sacrilege to front, <br>
Therefore, after thoroughly checking thy exterior, <br>
I submit the following conclusion; <br>
<br>
Thou arte indeed an architectural masterpiece. <br>
<br>
Gaining access is my only remaining task; indeed I must complete this divine appraisal. <br>
<br>
Although, before I can continue, I must ask, <br>
Is our age disparity going to place an obstruction upon the path toward resurrecting this ancient romance? <br>
<br>
Indeed thou felt the shaking of the earth upon our meeting. <br>
<br>
Shall we childishly pretend it did not happen or instead casually dismiss these timely reverberations as chance occurrences? <br>
<br>
O' my dearest Samia, indeed we cannot openly share the thoughts which travel through our minds without causing due embarrassment? <br>
Is this not an indication of an antiquated romance? <br>
<br>
Abandoning caution I announce, <br>
I am into you and thou indeed feels the same... <br>
At least this is the suggestive message of thy eyes <br>
Thus, what are we to do? <br>
<br>
Undeniably, <br>
we face innumerable restrictions, <br>
non-ignorable cultural barriers, <br>
definite race dissimilarity, <br>
and countless philosophical differences... <br>
<br>
and these are the easy obstacles. <br>
<br>
Nonetheless, thou knows the deal, <br>
<br>
I am hip-hop, <br>
no limitations, <br>
no restrictions, <br>
no frontin'... forever keeping it real... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey Samia, <br>
<br>
Did not a comforting sleep befall thee in the night? Was thy day filled with thoughts of places unknown? Has thou considered falling in-love after only one rap session? Unquestionably thou stumbled. My request,allow me to catch thee. For certain, a Lords embrace emanates with unimaginable bliss. <br>
<br>
If permitted, this lyrical composition can re-steady thy footing. Thus allowing thee to escape the tight rope of fear leftover from inferior attempts at romance. Clearly, I can never harm thee. For it is without condition that I am prepared to shower thee with much deserved adoration, availability and matured affection. <br>
<br>
Lovely arte thou dear Samia, throughout time thy photogenic splendor has not altered. Visions of Nile princesses grace thy face upon every change of expression. <br>
<br>
The spiritual effects of Nefertiti adds sun to thy face... <br>
<br>
A re-birthed grace from the soul of Cleopatra inserts seduction into thy every step, <br>
while the concealed passions of Delilah spirits thy convictions. <br>
<br>
O' Samia, for certain before our re-union, thou had failed to locate another who could comfort thy appeals. Therefore thou were as I found thee... <br>
<br>
Dissatisfied, <br>
unfulfilled, <br>
mis-understood and <br>
sexually frustrated.... <br>
<br>
Therefore, hesitantly I ask; <br>
<br>
Why has thou fallen for unfulfilling excursions? <br>
<br>
Are thou not in search of a respectful, available, spontaneous and fulfilling relationship? Was this not thy secret prayer the night we met? <br>
<br>
Consequently, <br>
thou must open thy heart and <br>
allow me to journey into the secret corridors of thy soul. <br>
<br>
Indeed, the instant thou acquires the courage to accept my hand, <br>
I shall purify thee as the Lord I am. <br>
<br>
Swiftly shall I cleanse thee of any contamination that may have left thee scarred and ashamed. I know thou were in search of a man, instead it is thy Lord that thou has received. Is this not more appropriate for thy needs? <br>
<br>
<br>
Indeed timely appearances authenticate an answer to ones prayerful request? <br>
<br>
Does thou believe a Lord responds to the calls of those who call upon him in the privacy of night? <br>
<br>
Upon the presentation of above question, <br>
will thou now take a moment to digest the outpourings of this man named Lord? <br>
<br>
O' Samia, I encourage thee to consume these imagination filled droplets of adoration that I respectfully place before thee... <br>
<br>
<br>
Is thy preference slow and sensual, or does the appeal of dominance and force grab thy attention? <br>
I suspect, <br>
passionate and lustful initiated by spontaneity truly adds spice to thy intimacy. <br>
<br>
Therefore I write, <br>
Imagine <br>
<br>
my passion-filled breath echoing in thy ear, <br>
<br>
listen as I whisper of traveling along the contours of thy body <br>
to taste of thy eagerness.... <br>
<br>
Indeed I shall only re-surface after thou pleads for penetration... orally gracing thy lips shall be a presented taste of angelic chocolate. <br>
<br>
As a warmed intensity begins to flows through thy veins, <br>
I continue to entice thee through a spoken massage laid upon thy nipples, <br>
<br>
This full-lipped delight, (unable to be performed by all), <br>
will place thee at the peak of climatic insanity. <br>
<br>
Slow penetration shall be duly necessitated. <br>
With each muffled breath, <br>
thy will summon another inch of my endowment deeper into thyself. <br>
To areas previously unvisited I shall linger... <br>
<br>
Endlessly growing inside of thee, <br>
the muffled sounds of pleasure drive this performance <br>
The whisper of love' inadvertently escape thy lips.... <br>
<br>
Not totally unaware of the truthfulness and power of thy statements, <br>
thy heart shall be opened and I shall return to thee the ability to love fearlessly... <br>
<br>
In unmatched <br>
incomparable, <br>
unbelievable ecstasy, <br>
we shall pound out the powerful fluids of life... <br>
Gasping for breath, <br>
lungs expanded, <br>
sweat drenched <br>
and locked in a heavenly embrace shall we lay. <br>
From the heavens shall the stars give witness to our divine re-encounter........... <br>
<br>
My dearest Samia, thou can easily test the validity of this proposition a simple request and I shall quickly oblige thee. Creative, spontaneous and passionately inspired this is my stilo. Can thy swing with this? <br>
<br>
Question; <br>
Why does thou imprison thyself with inferior attempts at love? <br>
<br>
With this question, I encourage thee to consider my invitations. <br>
Come to me Samia, follow thy heart through the door of this matured romance. <br>
Allow me to massage thy temple with fables of distant lands. <br>
Indeed we can take tours of the Universe or <br>
casually run through the clouds to sit upon the moon. <br>
<br>
Through me, <br>
thou can walk across the water or glide upon the air. <br>
Interested? <br>
<br>
You can indeed test the validity of my assertions. <br>
Thou would most certainly no longer be the same. <br>
Maybe it would be better to consider my writings as inspired letters and not a secret invitation for rendezvous..... <br>
<br>
While consumed by this reflection, <br>
I shall mystically grab the sun for thee <br>
Magically shall I remove the sky <br>
Day darkness shall blanket us... <br>
In this obscurity, <br>
thou will seek my voice and learn to trust my guidance. <br>
Renewed faith will allow thee to hear clearly the call of thy Lord. <br>
For I have indeed heard thy cries in the night and I have arrived for thy benefit... <br>
Born of thy suppressed teardrops, I summon thee to dry thy eyes. <br>
Place thy final depressions upon my shoulder, for I am here to assist thee. <br>
Without a doubt, I have arrived suddenly to grant relief to thy earth pains. <br>
<br>
Likened to a protective father, <br>
atop my shoulders is where I shall place thee. <br>
<br>
With honor and deserved respect shall I re-fashion thy emotions. <br>
<br>
Allow me to touch thy heart O' Samia <br>
Take hold of my hand, for certain I too fall easily. <br>
My only question is; can we plunge together? <br>
<br>
Indeed I am quite capable of adopting thy heart and granting thee much needed affection? <br>
<br>
For certain, if my intentions were less than honorable, <br>
thou would clearly detect hypocrisy through the placement of these written expressions. <br>
<br>
O' my dear lost love, <br>
there exist not an age, geographical distance or cultural obstruction which will prevent the rekindling of the flames from this ancient romance. <br>
<br>
Indeed I recall when we were once committed has thou not sensed it? <br>
<br>
Undeniably, I am attracted to thee. <br>
I do not recall whether it was the way the night captured thy smile or the melodic breath of thy sensual giggle. <br>
It may have been the comforting way thy eyes embraced my words.... <br>
Never the matter, I am awestruck. <br>
Similar to the meaning of thy name, <br>
<br>
My dear ancient soul-mate, please consider; <br>
The TRUTH must precede the inspiration.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
