First of all make sure you are not trying to throw a big bass bug or something like that with a 3 wt<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  When I throw bass bugs and other big flies with my 7 wt I make sure I have a leader(Tapered) with a stout butt section to help turn the fly over, and I have to keep reminding myself to stop the rod on the forward cast.  Hope that helped.<br>

<br>
You have indicated that when you cast large flies such as heavily weighted, size six wooley buggers that you don't get distance and it feels jerky and un-coordinated.  Frequently, these problems arise when anglers start casting heavily weighted flies and/or dense sinktip lines.  Often this is the result of the angler not adjusting or changing his or her casting style (particularly the backcast) but casting these type of flies or lines as they would an unweighted (or lightly weighted) fly or floating line.<br>
<br>
Normally, when we are using unweighted flies and floating lines we are striving to have a nice crisp, defined (positive) stopping of the rod and narrow loops on the backcast and again on the forward cast.  When we start casting heavily weighted flies, such as Clouser minnows, or problably in your case heavily weighted wooley buggers, things change.  Heavily weighted flies have a much different dynamic than unweighted flies and when we cast them (because of their weight) they gain a momentum independent of the flyline and that is substaniatially different than unweighted (or lightly weighted and smaller) flies.  <br>
<br>
I suspicion that your problem starts in your backcast.  At the completion of our backcast we momentarily lose control of the line as evidenced by the lack of tension on the rod.  Usually, this is regained when we start the forward cast and again the rod tip is under tension and we regain control of the line.  This problem is magnified when we use weighted flies (or dense sink-tip fly lines) because they bounce back and create additional slack which must be removed before the rod is back under tension and the line is under control.<br>
<br>
I would suggest that first you alter your backcast.  This can be done in a couple of ways.  I would first recommend that you try making a Belgian or Oval cast. If you are not familar with these casts they have no defined stop on the backcast.  Basically, the backcast starts in horizontal plane and when your rod hand reaches the furthest backward point the rod hand then continues forward in a vertical plane.  In other words your rod hand travels an oval and once the backcast has begun the speed is not increased but is fairly constant and this speed remains fairly constant as the forward cast begins, however, the normal increase in hand speed occurs once the line begins to straighten behind the caster.  A normal stop occurs at the conclusion of the forward cast.  The advantage of this type of cast is that the line and fly are keep under a constant tension (unlike the normal backcast) and much better control is maintained and there is no slack that occurs.  <br>
<br>
I imagine that what I have written may not be very clear, however, if you have access to Mel Krieger's book there is and excellent series of photos illustrating this cast.  If memory serves me correctly Joan Wulff's book also has very good coverage of this under the oval cast.  Also, you might try the following, strip out about 25' of line and cast so the rod tip travels in an oval path.  Make three or four oval and end as you would a normal forward cast.  You should have constant tension and thus control of the line.  Now add the fly and see if you don't think you have better control and if the jerky and un-coordinated feeling is gone.  You can of course increase the amount of line being cast and shoot line on the foward cast and by doing this you can really get some line out. <br>
<br>
Another solution is simply making good but wider loops, this allows the weighted fly a longer turn around time on the backcast and also seems to limit the damage done by the fly's momentum.<br>
<br>
Finally, you might try going to a 2X tippet with the size six fly.<br>
<br>
Let me know if any of these help.<br>

      Casting bigger and more heavilyweighted flies than you are used to casting simply amplifies what you are doing right and what you, let's say, need work on. It's an immediate indicator.<br>
       Usually (actually almost always), the problem is in basic casting mechanics. You should check out your basics. Then find out what points you have to work on. Work on them. As you become a better caster, you'll find you can cast those &quot;big ones&quot; better, farther, and easier.<br>
       Get a local casting instructor and let him or her improve you.<br>
       The other thing is that you have to practice casting these flies on the water too. With improved basic technique and then a little fishing with the flies, you'll be casting them better. I guarantee it!<br>

<br>
While fishing in Jaca we needed to learn a technique that was employed by the Spanish anglers. They used 18 foot leaders with 2 heavily weighted flies. The last 10 feet or so of the leader was 5X tapered down to 6X. We bounced heavily weighted nymphs across the bottoms of deep pools. Considering that we had only a few feet of fly line the system was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> difficult to cast. <br>
<br>
One of the things that struck me the most was the change in direction from up stream to down stream. The type of system only amplified the problem. While casting from one to the other the change in direction was not 180 degrees but more like 140. Without careful attention to keeping my back casts in opposition to my forward cast, I would often put my flies in the trees like some sort of wild pitch. I would definately opt for the shortest possible leader length for an intermediate caster.<br>
<br>
By the way Steve, Mark Sedotti is probably the world's authority on casting weighted flies. I think everyone here could learn alot from him.<br>
