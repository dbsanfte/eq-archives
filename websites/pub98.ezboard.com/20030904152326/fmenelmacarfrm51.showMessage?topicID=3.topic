<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Great Giver</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Aron was in deep concentration. His eyes were closed, and the sweat rolled along his body. He panted heavily and his arms were stretched as if he was holding something open with great effort. He knew that he couldn't hold it much longer. Would his efforts be in vain, again? Suddenly there was a flash of light, followed by a pressure wave. He felt the wind striking through his hair. The light slowly diminished to a soft deep blue and finally faded out. A small object tickled on the floor in front of his feet. His face changed into a smile: he had succeeded, finally! He leant against the wall to regain his breath, until his heartbeat was normal again. He turned around to look at the object, excited as a kid opening a present. What had been given to him? The smile on his face disappeared as quick as it had appeared and he got angry. It was a pebble, it looked just like the ones on the back yard of the institute. <br>
All this years of study, all this efforts, and then this! He picked the stone up and stepped out of the Gift room. He walked through a hall with beautifully sculptured pillars and painted walls, but he didn't see them this time. He walked up the familiar stairs, with the magical sign on each step. He walked through a dark corridor into his room and flung the door shut. With balled fists he continued walking, up and down his room. He hated them all: the teachers, the priests, all people out on the streets who thought this was the best life there is. But most of all he hated The Great Giver himself. Pah, Great Giver. He looked once again at what had been given to him. <br>
&quot;Give me a hunting eagle, and I could do better&quot;, he thought. &quot;They don't deserve my faith, my prayers, my labor. I will take my revenge. I will leave them. I will go through this world and use my powers against them. I will show the world that the Great Giver is nonsense. I will destroy this stupid institute!&quot; <br>
That last thought frightened him a bit, though. He had been in this seminar as far as he could remember. Too long. Still angry, he took all his belongings, which were just a few cloths, a couple of books and some candles, stuffed them in his bag and walked out of the institute. The porter was the only one who noticed.<br>
&quot;Are you leaving?&quot;, he asked wonderingly.<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;, Aron answered snappy, and stepped out into the world.<br>
The light of the world blinded him, for he had been in the shadowy halls of the institute for quite some time. It was a bright day, and he couldn't see where he was going.<br>
&quot;Finally, I am free!&quot;, he thought. Then he heard people shouting &quot;Watch out!&quot;, followed by a heavy blow in his back.<br>
The next thing Aron saw was a yellow plane, which after closer investigation appeared to be a ceiling. He was lying in a bed, and his back and all other bones hurt terribly. He heard some people whisper:<br>
&quot;The servant woke up&quot;. A woman wearing a white suite appeared next to his bed. <br>
&quot;Where am I?&quot;, Aron asked.<br>
&quot;You are in a hospital, sir.&quot;, the woman answered:<br>
&quot;Hospital?&quot; Aron wanted to get into an upright position, but his back hurt too much. &quot;Why am I in a hospital?&quot;<br>
&quot;You were overrun by an oxen cart as you stepped out of the institute, Servant. Now please lie down quietly, that encourages the healing process.&quot; She left the room.<br>
&quot;Servant?&quot;, Aron thought. Then he remembered that he wouldn't be a servant anymore. Never! With balled fist he feel asleep. <br>
As he woke up again, the nurse was again in his room. <br>
&quot;How do you feel now, Servant?&quot;, she asked. His back still hurt, but not as much as before. Aron forgot the pain and lifted himself on his elbows.<br>
&quot;I'm not a servant anymore!&quot;, he said in an angry voice. The nurse was surprised and retreated quickly from the room. He heard her whisper to some person down the corridor, and then she returned with a man, also dressed in white.<br>
&quot;You're not a servant? How is that? You wear the cloths of a servant!&quot;, the doctor said<br>
&quot;That are all the cloths I have got, doctor. I just decided this morning that I don't want to be a servant anymore.&quot; Now it was the doctor's time to get angry.<br>
&quot;And you think we are going to spill our skills and medicines on just some ordinary young man?&quot; He moved his face close to Aron's. &quot;No, my friend, that's not the way this world works. If you are a servant, the institute pays for you. If you are not, you have to pay by yourself. Since neither of them seems to happen, unfortunately we are forced to set you out of here. Get out of my hospital now!&quot;, he pointed firmly to the door opening.<br>
&quot;But...but...&quot;<br>
&quot;No buts. We cannot afford to treat every fool in this town who gets himself overrun by an oxen cart. So, out!&quot; The doctor grabbed Aron out of his bed and pushed him through the door, down the corridor and out of the hospital. Aron fell, and lay miserably on the ground. A few minutes later, the nurse came back with his belongings and dropped them next to him without saying a word. <br>
&quot;So this was life without the Great Giver?&quot;, Aron thought. He would pay them back. Definitely.<br>
He tried to get up, and leaning heavily against the wall he finally succeeded. That annoying pain in his bones! He wished he had learned something useful instead of wasting in his time on that Great Giver. He looke in his bag, the object he had received was still there. He picked it up and weighed it in his hand, then put it back. He could throw it away anytime. It was time to try to do something against his hurting back. He closed his eyes and concentrated as he had learned, which was diffcult due to the pain. Slowly he focused his attention on his hurting bones, but the pain only increased. He quickly stopped his effort; it had to heal the natural way. He looked around and noticed that he was in some small alley, with high buildings on each site.<br>
He grabbed his bag and staggered to the next building. And while he rested from this effort, he suddenly looked into a young and filthy face. The face had sharp blue eyes, black hair, a pointy nose and chin and was most likely looking for trouble. The face looked curiously back and asked:<br>
&quot;What's a servant doing here?&quot; <br>
&quot;Hey, I'm not a servant anymore!&quot;, Aron replied. The other looked at Aron's bruises<br>
&quot;They kicked you out?&quot;, he asked with a broad grin.<br>
&quot;Yes, but not out of the institute&quot;<br>
&quot;Then you don't have any money?&quot;<br>
&quot;No.&quot;, Aron said. &quot;All you can do is beat me up&quot;.<br>
&quot;Perhaps I will do that some day. But first you come with me to the Boss.&quot;, he said, &quot;He might have some use for a Servant. Oh, excue me, ex-servant.&quot; The boy chuckled.<br>
&quot;If you would be so kind to follow me?&quot;, he asked politely, and at the same time Aron felt the pressure of a knife in his side.<br>
&quot;Just in case&quot;, the boy said with a big smile. &quot;Oh, by the way, you can call me Glick. Everyone does.&quot;<br>
&quot;Glick, what kind of name is that?&quot;, he asked<br>
&quot;Mine. Now move&quot;. Glick gave him a pushed in his back.<br>
While they were walking Aron felt constantly the point of Glick's knife pressing against his side. It remembered him that he had no choice. Besides that, Aron had no clue where he was; as a Servant, he had never been much in the city, and hadn't even been allowed to. On the few occasions he had been out of the institute, he had never seen the streets and alleys they were walking through now. The streets were muddy and only partially plastered. The houses towered high and threatening on both sides of the street, as if they guarded it. The punishment on tresspassing would be getting buried under a large pile of rubble, wood and stone. <br>
Glick had adopted the voice of a tour guide.<br>
&quot;As you can see, the city contains many more beautiful places than only the institute and the town hall. Take a look at the marvelous brittle wall to your left, on which new species of fungi are evolving. Now, to your right, you can see the famous ramshackle house of Jack the Drinker. No, please don't touch it. It has been on the verge of breaking down for over a decade, and we don't want to let that happen right now, do we? If you look a little bit ahead, again on your right side...&quot; Glick went on and on and on, with a sly grin on his face, and his hand had a steady grip on his knife. His cloak covered both hand and knife, so to an arbitrary passer-by it looked just like two young people walking together and planning mischief. <br>
Aron didn't like that knife in his side, not at all. He didn't dare to run away or fight Glick, because he knew that he wouldn't be fast enough. He spent some thoughts on the problem, and finally got an idea. He had had a Servant's training, after all, and one of the main tasks of a Servant was to create a gap. If he was able to create a gap between the knife and his body... It would be possible to maintain it for a short time, because it was small, so he reasoned. He had never tried anything like that before, but one day had to be the first. <br>
While he was staggering on, he tried to concentrate. It wasn't easy, but after some time he was in the well-known state of mind. He tried to force a gap, he already felt some changes to the situation, when he tripped over and fell. Glick was immediately upon him. <br>
&quot;No tricks&quot;, he hissed. &quot;Stand up slowly&quot;. Aron stood up, but the fall didn't make him feel better. Glick, however, seemed to enjoy this little accident and was soon in his usual chitchat mode. <br>
&quot;You should pay more attention to your feet, Mr. Ex-servant. The streets are quite uneven today. If you are absent-minded again, you will inevitably fall again.&quot;, he said with a smile and winked.<br>
They turned around a corner into another shady alley and stopped in front of a wooden door, where Glick knocked upon. Aron tried to follow the rhythm, but it was too complex. Immediately another knocking sequence was heard from the other side of the door, just as complex, but different. Glick completed the code by knocking a third rhythm, and finally the door opened and they entered. In the shadows behind the door, an giant woman appeared. She was nearly 2 meters tall, just as broad and had an enormous bosom. <br>
&quot;Been naughty, little rat?&quot;, the guard said with a terrible sweet voice. And indeed, Glick was not more than a little rat compared to her. <br>
&quot;Not this time, ma'am. I got you another buddy.&quot;, Glick said, and pushed Aron forward.<br>
&quot;What, this pathetic hope of bones?&quot;, the guard asked.<br>
For the first time, Glick looked unsure.<br>
&quot;But he is a Servant!&quot;, he complained.<br>
&quot;It's alright, little rat. Now, off with you.&quot;, she gave him a rap on his bottom and Glick ran away, whereupon the Guard closed the door.<br>
&quot;Well, well, what are going to do with you?&quot; The guard turned her colossal body towards Aron and inspected him from top to toe. <br>
&quot;I don't know, ma'am&quot;, repeating the way Glick had addressed her. &quot;This Glick boy took me here. Can someone now please tell me where I am and what I am doing here?&quot;.<br>
&quot;Hahaha, my baby wants to know where he is.&quot;, she laughed. She grabbed him firmly in his neck and pushed him forward. &quot;Walk and you will find out&quot;. She tightened her grip on him a bit and added: &quot;Or don't walk, and you will never find out.&quot; <br>
&quot;Ouch!&quot; was all Aron dared to say.<br>
He was pushed through a dark and narrow corridor to another door, where the complex knocking ritual was repeated. The door opened and they entered a large and bright room. A low table and some comfortable chairs were placed in the opposite corner. A beautiful carpet lay on the ground in front of an expensive looking wooden desk. A desk like the Great Servant of the institute had, Aron thought. A fat man with a jovial face was seated behind the desk, smoking a cigar and writing on some paper. <br>
As Aron was pushed forward, he put the cigar out of his mouth.<br>
&quot;Thank you, Helena&quot;, he said with a smile and nodded to the guard. The guard Helena smiled back and retreated through the door. <br>
&quot;Please sit down&quot;, the man gestured to the chairs. &quot;I will be with you in a minute.&quot;<br>
While the man finished his writings, Aron looked further around the room. Now he noticed the fireplace and the gold-framed paintings on the wall. He also discovered who had performed the second knocking ritual: next to the door stood a small and lean man, clad in a dark cape. He was quite the opposite to the guard at the door, Helena, but probably just as dangerous. He discovered similar men guarding the two other doors in the room. They all had their hands buried under their cape, and were continuously observing him, each other, and the man behind the desk. Aron had the feeling that he would be dead as soon as he moved. <br>
The man had finally finished with whatever he had been writing, and took a seat opposite to Aron's. <br>
&quot;So, you are not a servant anymore?&quot;, he asked. Aron had expected a lot, but not this opening. He wondered how the man knew this. Aron hadn't heard any body talking to him. <br>
&quot;Eh...yes...eh, that's true&quot;, he stammered. <br>
&quot;You wonder how I know this, don't you?&quot;, the man asked. &quot;As a man in my position you need to be well informed.&quot;, he added with a smile.<br>
&quot;That's nice for you&quot;, Aron said, &quot;but first I want to know where I am and why I am where I am! I deserve to know that!&quot;<br>
&quot;Ah, those people at the institute. They study hard in their books and don't have a clue what is going on right under their nose. Yet they feel so superior. Books, that reminds me&quot;. He waved at one of the guards, who brought them a familiar looking bag.<br>
&quot;This is your bag, I assume?&quot;, the man asked?<br>
&quot;Yes, but...&quot;. The man waved his complaints away.<br>
&quot;Your books look quite interesting, but we need someone who can use the knowledge that is contained within them. And we need someone who knows the institute. That means, you could be of some value for us.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah sure I am of value for you, otherwise you would have put all this effort in getting me here. But I don't even know who you are!&quot;, exclaimed Aron<br>
&quot;You honestly don't know?&quot;, the man was quite surprised. &quot;I thought you were performing some act. You don't have a clue?&quot; The man leaned back in his seat for a moment, then he asked: &quot;Does the name 'Casey's Angels' ring a bell?&quot;, he asked.<br>
&quot;No&quot;, Aron answered and shook his head.<br>
&quot;No?&quot;, the man was very surprised now. &quot;It seems that I have to spend more attention to the institute. Well, I am Casey and these are my angels.&quot; He made a wide gesture. &quot;You can become one of my angels, too, but let me first introduce my business to you. Let's see. About twenty years ago I started this business with two companions. Our turnover increased every year and new members joined us. We became larger and larger. Still, all our members are very dedicated to this organization and are very valuable to us. Although my two companions unfortunately died on a meeting, this business prospered. That was also when I changed the name into 'Casey's Angels'. Right now, with a turnover of more than 1 million gold pieces a year we are the number one organization in the relocation business in this town.&quot;<br>
&quot;Relocation business?&quot;, Aron asked. The word sounded strange to him.<br>
&quot;Basically we relocate money and valuable objects. We relocate it from other people to ourselves. Besides that, we offer some other services, but relocation is our core business.&quot;<br>
&quot;So you are ordinary thieves&quot;, Aron stated. Casey took a few deep breaths before he replied.<br>
&quot;Oh no, we aren't ordinary thieves. In a large organization like ours we can use more advanced techniques like blackmailing and gambling and cheating. Besides that, if you do things ordinary, you don't live very long.&quot; Casey glanced shortly over to the guards, and Aron got the double meaning. One second later, Casey smiled again.<br>
&quot;All our new employees start in the stealing business, and that's exactly the road you will take.&quot;<br>
&quot;I wish he stopped smiling&quot;, Aron thought.<br>
&quot;I don't really have a choice, do I?&quot;, Aron said.<br>
&quot;Wrong again&quot;, Casey's smile got broader. &quot;We always leave a choice to the people who come here. However, once you are here, not accepting the job means a safety hazard for us, therefore we were unfortunately forced to get rid of you in a way you may not like. I'm sure you understand this. I'm not an unreasonable man, though, I always give the candidates a few hours time to think about it.&quot;<br>
Casey stood up and grabbed a rope that was dangling along one of the walls. Somewhere in the house rang a bell, and a minute later a girl in a purple dress with a wild bunch of black hair walked into the room Here bare feet hardly made a noise on the floor. <br>
&quot;Yes Sir?&quot;, she asked and bowed.<br>
&quot;Ah, there you are. Please be so kind to show Aron the guest room.&quot;<br>
Her already pale face became a bit paler.<br>
&quot;No worries&quot;, Casey said. &quot;Aron is new here. He needs a silent place to think.&quot;, Casey said. The girl nodded as a sign that she understood. Aron grabbed his belongings and followed the girl out of the room. As he passed the door, the guard gave him a grim smile. Aron had expected that they would go upstairs, but instead they went downwards on a small stone staircase. As they entered the damp cellar, the girl picked up a torch and lit it. Now Aron saw that on the other end of the room was a heavy steel door. <br>
&quot;Where are you taking me?&quot;, Aron asked her.<br>
&quot;To the guestroom, sir&quot;, she said timidly. &quot;We are nearly there.&quot; She walked over to the steel door and opened it.<br>
&quot;In here, please&quot;, she said.<br>
The room behind the door had three blind walls, and except for the torch of the girl no light was coming in. On the left side of the room was a comfortable bed, on the right side some nasty looking equipment and suspicious stains. <br>
&quot;Are they going to torture me?&quot;, he wondered. He weighed his possibilities. He could grab the torch out of the hands of the girl, she would be no match for him, Aron estimated. Although, he doubted that Casey would leave him alone with a girl that was no match for him. In either case he wouldn't get far, this place was guarded too well. He shrugged and entered the room. <br>
The girl looked like a ghost in the torchlight<br>
&quot;Sleep well, sir&quot;, she said. &quot;If you need anything, bang on the door and shout as loud as you can.&quot; Aron tried to find any irony in her voice, but couldn't find it. She must have been serious. Silent as a ghost she stepped out of the room and Aron heard how she locked the door. Now he was plunged into utter darkness. She really had been serious. With a sigh he felt his way to the bed and quickly fell asleep.<br>
When he woke up it was still dark. His memories returned quickly: he was in a cell in the cellar of some master thief. He stood up, stretched his limbs and remembered what the girl had said. He cleared his throat and screamed as loud as he could &quot;heeeyyyy&quot;, while he battered the door with his fists. Had someone heard him? Just as he decided to repeat the procedure, he heard a soft 'click' and the door opened. The same girl as before stood in the open door with a torch; she gestured him to follow. Aron moved a hand through his hair, grabbed his possessions and followed. He felt something in his pocket, it was still the thing he had gotten from the Giver. Well, the day of his revenge would come.<br>
They went back to the room where he had talked with Casey. &quot;The throne room&quot;, as Aron had called it for himself. As they entered, Casey arose and greeted them with a smile.<br>
&quot;Ah, you have reached a decision.&quot;, he says<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;, Aron said. &quot;Let's get over with this quickly. I'll do it.&quot;<br>
&quot;Good boy, very good&quot;, Casey beamed and patted him on his shoulder. &quot;You just have made your first step on a very promising career at Casey's Angels.&quot; <br>
For the first time since he had left the institute, Aron thought about his future career. Spending his whole life robbing and stealing didn't appeal very much to him, but on the other hand, this was the perfect organization to let the institute know they were nothing. Nothing, he repeated to himself.<br>
In the mean time, Casey had opened a bottle of wine and filled three glasses. &quot;Three?&quot;, Aron thought. Casey saw his confusion and smiled even broader as Glick entered the room.<br>
&quot;Glick will join us tonight&quot;, Casey said. &quot;Come, Glick, sit down and listen to what you have to do. You two know each other already, don't you?&quot;. They both nodded.<br>
&quot;Good&quot;, Casey continued, &quot;because you two have to cooperate to make this mission a success. I like successes&quot;, he said, while he was still smiling. He went on more serious.<br>
&quot;I need something, something valuable. And because it's valuable, it is guarded well. But first tell me, Aron, how well do you know the institute.&quot;<br>
&quot;The institute, you mean we have to steal from there?&quot;, Aron asked surprised.<br>
&quot;Where else could I need you? But you are quick of mind&quot;, Casey replied. &quot;Well?&quot;<br>
Aron described the halls and the corridors, the location of the various rooms and the Gift room. <br>
&quot;And do you know where to hide?&quot;, Casey asked him. A smile appeared on Aron's face as he drifted back in his memories. He remembered how he played hide-and-seek in the halls and the corridors, and described his favorite hiding places, while Glick and Casey listened carefully. Finally Aron was finished and Casey took the word again.<br>
&quot;As you already guessed, I need something from the institute. I already said that it is something precious. To be precisely, I need a stone. Although it looks like an ordinary stone, it's grey and oval, but it is quite valuable. The good thing about valuable objects is that they are kept in separately.What I want is one of the few stones who have the nice feature that they reflect a person's life just before he dies. That's quite useful in some cases, I'm sure you can imagine when.&quot; Casey took a deep breath. &quot;This stone is kept on the desk of the Great Servant himself.&quot;<br>
Aron and Glick looked at each other, but remained silent. The desk of the Great Servant! It would be hard to get there unnoticed.<br>
Casey took a map.<br>
&quot;This is a map of the institute.&quot;, he said. &quot;In about one hour you will go there and you enter as if you were a visitor. By the time you arrive, it will be dawn. The only time when there are no people at the Great Servant's office is when he is having dinner. As Aron here knows, the dinner is served as soon as the sun is set, and it lasts for about an hour. You two will move with the masses towards the dining hall over here, but make sure that you find a cover before you enter the hall itself. As you can see, the dining hall is quite close ro the Great Servant's office. This means that you have to stay hidden until the Great Servant has entered the hall. Then you sneak on to his office.<br>
The office is guarded by two men. Glick will divert the guards, he is good at that, and you, Aron, will enter the office, take the stone, and retreat immediately. The Great Servant always enters the dining hall as the last and leaves first. This means that you have less than an hour, probably half an hour. Afterwards you two will meet again in Grounding Alley. That's right here.&quot; He pointed on the map at a small alley to the west of the institute. &quot;Do you have any questions?&quot;, Casey asked.<br>
They examined the map and discussed some parts of the plan, and then it was time to leave. Aron was wearing his old Servant costume, and Glick had got a new one. Where they got it from, he didn't know, since they were only allowed to Servants. They left the house the same way as they had come, and silently they walked through the back alley of the city towards the main entrance of the institute. Although Aron had seen it many times before, the building looked large and threatening. It was as if it wanted to say: &quot;you don't belong here, don't dare entering me!&quot; He swallowed, and boldly stepped inside, followed by Glick.<br>
Their timing couldn't have been better. The dinner bells must just have been rung, because all students and master Servants and other inhabitants of the building were on their way to the dining hall, loudly discussing whatever occupied their mind. Aron and Glick mingled successfully with the crowd and drifted through the large corridors. As they approached the dining hall, Aron nodded to Glick pointed at a staircase. It went up to the library and underneath was a half-open space where some broomsticks were kept. Glick smiled. They got a few confused looks as they stepped out of the row, but no one did really bother. They didn't jump the queue, after all.<br>
&quot;And now?&quot;, Glick asked as they sat in their shelter. <br>
&quot;We wait till everybody's in, and then we proceed secretly to the Grand Servant's office&quot;, Aron whispered back. &quot;It's right there around the corner. The guards are usually standing to the left and the right of the door. How are you going to distract them?&quot;<br>
&quot;You will see, I have my methods.&quot;, he grins. &quot;Just make sure you get that stone. And don't forget to walk out quickly.&quot; <br>
Aron wanted to go already, but Glick stopped him &quot;We first have to wait until the Great Servant enters the hall!&quot;, he hissed.<br>
Then they heard footsteps. Glick sneaked around the corner to have a look at who it was, then he winked Aron. <br>
&quot;Is that the chief?&quot;, he whispered. Aron looked at the broad, bald man and his thick expensive robes. The man was walking alone. <br>
&quot;Yes&quot;, Aron nodded.<br>
As soon as the man had closed the doors behind him, Aron and Glick moved stealthily onward to the last corner before the office of the Great Servant. Glick counted on his fingers to three, then sped forward. He kept running to the left and right in front of them and insulted them: &quot;Fat pig! Your father was born to a snail and a lame duck, and your mother is a llama! I bet you can't even beat a mosquito with that sword of yours!&quot;<br>
&quot;Hey, you, kids are not allowed here!&quot;, they shouted, but Glick ran away and the guards pursued him to show him what he could do with their swords. <br>
Aron waited until the sound of their heavy boots was far enough away. He took a deep breath and entered the office. He froze, because he had never expected what he saw now. The desk was one big mess. Piles of paper were lying everywhere between a great diversity of objects: tools, cloths, jewelry, a strange bronze disk, a few bricks and even an owl, which opened one eye as Aron approached. In this mess he had to find the stone they were looking for? Grey and round, Casey had said. Well, he'd better start quickly, before the guards returned.<br>
He moved sheets of paper, put objects aside, looked underneath the desk, but couldn't find it. Frantically he tried again, made sure that he didn't skip a single place and finally found the stone: it was grey, obtuse, and embedded in a glass cube. The reason he hadn't found it before was that the owl was sitting upon it. It was already too late to grab it, though. A shadow appeared in the door opening, shouting:<br>
&quot;Hey, what are you doing in here? Another one of those stinkin' rats!&quot;<br>
The guards had returned! Aron dived to the open door and made it through. He started running through the corridor, but then he felt a sharp pain in his back and he fell. He felt how a liquid ran down his body. When he looked at his hand he saw it was red. Was this his blood? An object fell out of his pocket on the floor. Intuitively he grabbed it, it was the thing the Giver had given to him. As he looked at it, the stone became reflective. Wasn't it an ordinary pebble after all? Was this another one of the kind of stone he had to steal? Casey had indicated that there were more of them after all. But why?<br>
In the mirroring stone he saw himself, he saw his life passing by. He saw himself as a boy, and his years at the institute. He saw his failed attempts and finally the successful one to make contact with the Great Giver. He saw how he left the institute, the things that happened these last few days. All the time he asked himself: &quot;Why did the Giver give me this stone?&quot;, but there was no-one around to answer him. Finally he saw himself lying on the floor, whereupon the mirror faded. The last thing Aron noticed was that someone grabbed the stone from his hand and ran away.<br>
