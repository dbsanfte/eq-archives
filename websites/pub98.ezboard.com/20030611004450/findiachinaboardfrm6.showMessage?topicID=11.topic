By Michael Forsythe and Le-min Lim<br>
<br>
<br>
Beijing, Jan. 2 (Bloomberg) -- China, whose economy has outgrown its biggest rivals' for the past seven years, may no longer need a weak currency to keep its edge. Executives and analysts say a stronger yuan would lift company earnings and economic growth. <br>
<br>
Since China pegged the yuan at 8.3 to the dollar in 1995, cheap exports have fueled a $199 billion trade surplus and low manufacturing costs have drawn $308 billion in foreign investment. China's growing clout as the world's largest consumer market may help it sustain last year's 8 percent economic growth rate, even with a stronger yuan making exports costlier. <br>
<br>
Some of China's biggest companies say they'd gain from a stronger currency as they import more and expand overseas. China Eastern Airlines Corp.'s fuel bill and foreign debt burden would shrink. China Unicom Ltd. could buy imported phone equipment more cheaply. Oilfields from Indonesia to Algeria would cost less for Sinopec, the nation's largest listed company. <br>
<br>
``Overseas assets would be cheaper for us if the yuan gained in value,'' said Shao Jingyang, a deputy director at China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec. A 5 percent gain in the yuan would also cut the cost of Sinopec's planned 2003 oil imports by more than $100 million, based on current prices. <br>
<br>
Motorola Inc. and other foreign investors say a stronger yuan wouldn't make them leave. While costs would rise and their exports would become more expensive in the U.S. and elsewhere, China's market of 1.3 billion consumers is reason enough to stay. <br>
<br>
Boeing, Wal-Mart <br>
<br>
A stronger yuan would make Boeing Co. planes and General Electric Co. turbine engines cheaper in China, boosting their exports and helping to narrow the U.S.'s largest trade deficit with any country. Companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which buys $10 billion in goods from China each year, may suffer as China-made clothes, computer parts and other goods became pricier. <br>
<br>
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates that the yuan is undervalued by 15 percent. China is growing more open to calls from Japanese Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa and other foreign officials to let the currency appreciate, analysts say. <br>
<br>
Chinese Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said in November calls for a stronger yuan have increased. <br>
<br>
``I personally feel some pressure, and this is something the U.S. is pondering,'' Xiang said. The U.S. trade deficit with China widened to $83.1 billion in the first 10 months of 2002 from $70.4 billion a year earlier. <br>
<br>
The government will widen the range in which the yuan can trade with the U.S. dollar within two years, effectively strengthening the currency by as much as 5 percent, according to six out of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Three expect no change during the period, and one declined to give a forecast. <br>
<br>
``It has always been in the cards to widen the band,'' said Jonathan Anderson, Goldman's head of Asia-Pacific economic research in Hong Kong. ``We think the time is fairly ripe.'' <br>
<br>
12 to 18 Months <br>
<br>
Goldman expects China to expand the yuan's trading range within the next 12 to 18 months, initially moving to a 1 percent band from the current 0.2 percent. <br>
<br>
China, which devalued the yuan by more than half before fixing its value in 1995, still has plenty of reasons to resist a stronger currency. <br>
<br>
A weak yuan has helped swell the trade surplus in a country that had a $12.2 billion deficit in 1993 -- especially in 2002, when the currency weakened in tandem with the dollar, which fell 15 percent against the euro. China's economy has grown an average 8.4 percent in the past seven years, outpacing most in the world. <br>
<br>
Letting the currency strengthen would make imported agricultural goods cheaper, threatening China's farmers. About 800 million of China's 1.3 billion people live in rural areas. <br>
<br>
A stronger currency would make China-made mobile phones, toys and computer parts more expensive overseas. Even so, foreign investors such as Motorola -- which plans to export 20 million mobile phones from China this year -- say the advantages of staying in China would outweigh that risk. <br>
<br>
Biggest Mobile Market <br>
<br>
``One of Motorola's strategies for China is to build China into a worldwide manufacturing center,'' said Tim Chen, president of the company's local unit, which had $4.9 billion in sales last year -- the highest of any foreign company. ``The China market, which is growing fast, has great potential.'' <br>
<br>
The world's No. 2 mobile-phone maker controls about 30 percent of the domestic mobile-phone market, the world's biggest with 200 million subscribers. Average wages in China have more than quadrupled in the past decade, government figures show. <br>
<br>
China's biggest publicly traded companies, which have sold shares to investors in New York and Hong Kong in recent years, stand to gain more from a stronger yuan than they'd lose. <br>
<br>
Phone companies such as China Unicom, China Mobile (H.K.) Ltd. and China Telecom Corp. would save on equipment they buy from Lucent Technologies Inc., Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp. They're increasing such purchases as they build advanced networks to attract higher-paying customers. <br>
<br>
`Too Weak' <br>
<br>
The three phone operators, among China's top five publicly traded companies by sales, have all sold shares overseas in the past five years. <br>
<br>
China's trading partners say its economy has outgrown the value of its currency. <br>
<br>
``Surely the yuan is too weak when we consider the current strength of the country,'' Shiokawa said on Dec. 6. Japan, China's No. 2 trading partner, is at risk of its fourth recession in a decade as exports stall and manufacturers such as Citizen Watch Co. move to China to cut costs. <br>
<br>
The yuan would appreciate if the currency were allowed to trade freely because of China's rising foreign-exchange reserves, trade surplus and incoming foreign investment, economists say. <br>
<br>
Cheaper Planes <br>
<br>
Growing domestic demand means Chinese companies are importing more parts and materials and increasing overseas investments. <br>
<br>
China Eastern, the country's No. 3 airline, plans to increase its fleet of Boeing and Airbus SAS planes to 100 by 2005 from 74 now. A stronger yuan would cut the cost of new planes and imported fuel and trim the 22.6 billion yen ($190.4 million) the company owes Japanese lenders, spokesman Luo Zhuping said. <br>
<br>
Domestic carmakers, which produce almost exclusively for the local market and use imported parts, would also gain. <br>
<br>
``A stronger yuan would be good for us,'' said Zheng Gang, a spokesman for Qingling Motors Co., which makes Isuzu-brand pickup trucks in Chongqing in central China. ``We could buy auto parts more cheaply.'' Japanese-made parts accounted for about 30 percent of Qingling's sales costs last year, he said. <br>
<br>
For Wu Xinping, who sells knockoff Timberland hats and gloves and trades currency on the black market in Beijing's Silk Alley, a stronger yuan is already a reality. Wu used to offer customers a premium for their U.S. currency. Now, he gives them less than the official 8.28 rate when he exchanges their dollars for yuan. <br>
<br>
``A few years ago one dollar would buy 8.7 yuan,'' Wu said. ``Now the rate is 8.25.'' <br>
