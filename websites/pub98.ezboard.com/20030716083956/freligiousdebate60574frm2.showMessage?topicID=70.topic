<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Quiz : How to tell if you're a fundamentalist</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Simply answer the multiple-choice questions, and total up your score at the end. You will be rated depending on how many A, B or C answers you gave (just like those wacky magazine quizzes!)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1. Your daughter announces that she has lost her faith in God. How do you respond?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Express concern at her change of heart, but respect her decision.<br>
B) Disown her completely, and make sure that all your family and friends never speak to her ever again.<br>
C) Kill her. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2. A scientist publishes data that appears to refute your theory of creation. How do you respond?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Critically examine the new findings, and modify or even abandon your theory if necessary.<br>
B) Acknowledge the new findings, maybe even admit that your theory is at fault, but continue with your theory unchanged.<br>
C) If the new data does not agree with your beliefs, then it is nothing more than LIES from the DEVIL himself, and you will not listen to it. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>3. Your child is critically ill, and requires life-saving major surgery. Do you...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Take the child to hospital immediately, and pray that she recovers quickly.<br>
B) Take the child to the local faith-healer (on TV if possible), as modern so-called medicine is not to be trusted.<br>
C) Tuck the child into bed, and pray over her. If she dies, it is surely God's will. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>4. It is Sunday morning. What do you do?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Have breakfast, watch some inspirational religious programmes, maybe go to the park if it's a nice day.<br>
B) Go to church in your best clothes. Take the children whether they want to go or not.<br>
C) Get up at 5am and walk the streets, taking the Word Of God to people on their doorsteps. They will not be upset at being awakened so early, if they are given Good News. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>5. It is Easter. How do you celebrate?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Buy the kids some Easter Eggs, watch &quot;Jesus Christ, Superstar&quot; on TV.<br>
B) Go to church, and remember how Christ died for you.<br>
C) Build a large wooden cross and nail yourself to it, so that others may see how Jesus suffered. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>6. A local clinic is performing abortions. How do you respond?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Pray that the young girls make the right decision, one way or another.<br>
B) Write an angry letter to the local newspaper, and Church newsletter. Maybe picket the clinic with a group of friends.<br>
C) Shoot one of the doctors, while waving a banner saying &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>7. You have committed a minor sin. What do you do?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Be sure to mention it next time you go to confession.<br>
B) Pray for several hours for forgiveness.<br>
C) Get a friend to beat you with birch branches until you pass out from loss of blood. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>8. Your wife has asked for a new dress for her birthday. What do you get her?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Something expensive that shows off her best features.<br>
B) Something plain and baggy, but comfortable.<br>
C) A huge black dress that covers her from head to foot, leaving just a small slit so that she can see where she's going. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>9. It is Halloween. What do you do?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Have a Halloween party, let the kids dress up as monsters and ghosts. What fun!<br>
B) It is a pagan ritual, and you will have nothing to do with it.<br>
C) Walk the streets, shouting at foolish parents who are leaving their children open to demonic possession and Satan's influence. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>10. You are part of a team designing a new type of jet engine. How do you do your research?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Acquire as much information on the subject as you can, from all leading experts.<br>
B) As A, but also pray for guidance and strength.<br>
C) Read Genesis. All answers may be found in Genesis. Yes. All answers. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>11. A biology teacher at the local school is teaching the Theory of Evolution. Do you...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Feel relieved that good science is being taught, but make sure to teach your children about the spiritual world as well.<br>
B) Request that the school gives equal time to Biblical Creationism as well.<br>
C) Take your children out of that den of Satan. Teach them Genesis. Pray for the teacher, as he is going to burn in Hell for a loooong time. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>12. Your favourite married TV Evangelist has been caught taking drugs with a prostitute. He tearfully appeals for forgiveness on his show. What do you do?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) See through his scam, and hope he gets everything he deserves.<br>
B) Pray that he has seen the error of his ways. Jesus forgives him, so why can't you?<br>
C) Cry all night. Send him all your money. Write angry letters to the newspapers asking why he is being persecuted for his faith. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>13. Your church leader has predicted the imminent end of the world. What do you do?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Ignore him. You've heard it all before, and you know he gets a bit excitable.<br>
B) Pray harder and try to strengthen your faith for the end-times ahead.<br>
C) Sell your house and belongings. Store food and weapons. Drive into the hills so you can watch the Rapture coming while all the sinners perish in flames. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>14. Amazing new pictures have been released from the Hubble Space Telescope. What is your reaction?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Marvel at the natural beauty of the universe.<br>
B) Marvel at the awesome spectacle of God's Creation.<br>
C) Marvel at the clear images of Jesus, Peter and Mary that God has painted using galaxies and nebulae. Annotate them accordingly and place them on a website so that others may see them also. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>15. You meet a stranger walking down the street, who asks you the time. What do you say to him/her?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) &quot;Let's see... It's a quarter past eleven. You're welcome.&quot;<br>
B) &quot;Quarter past eleven. Say, I'm on my way to church - would you care to come along?&quot;<br>
C) &quot;It's nearly the time of the Second Coming! Kneel, friend, and pray with me for Christ Jesus is on His way!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>16. While out with your church friends, you meet a disabled person in a wheelchair. How do you react?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Treat them exactly as you would anyone else.<br>
B) Tell them how brave they are, and that you'll pray for them.<br>
C) Tip them out of the chair, and hold them down while praying and trying to drive out the demons that are inflicting them. Their cries of rage or fear are clear evidence of the devils fighting the exorcism. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>17. You are the pilot of a passenger aircraft. One of the engines fails at twenty thousand feet. What is your reaction?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Inform air-traffic control, and attempt to land at the nearest airfield.<br>
B) Attempt an emergency landing. Praise your God for bringing you all to safety. A miracle!<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>18. When asked, &quot;Do you feel that you are able to truly think for yourself?&quot;, how do you reply?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) &quot;Of course. I make up my own mind, even if goes against my religious upbringing.&quot;<br>
B) &quot;I'll ask my church elders, and get back to you.&quot;<br>
C) &quot;I used to, but now I happily submit my will to my God. Life is so much better this way.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>19. Your teenage son is playing rock music in his room with some friends. What do you do?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Say &quot;Hey, this has got a good beat!&quot;, and dance around, embarassing him forever.<br>
B) Ask if he wouldn't rather play some good Inspirational music, or Gospel albums?<br>
C) Call the church Elders around to exorcise the stereo system, and drive the demons out of the child before he loses his soul to Satan. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>20. How did you celebrate the year 2000?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Like every other New Year, you had a get-together with family and friends. Maybe a bit bigger than usual.<br>
B) Even though you knew that the dates are a little arbitrary, you still chose to celebrate this as 2000 years since the birth of Christ.<br>
C) Sold all your posessions, bought a one-way ticket to Jerusalem and an &quot;I TOLD YOU SO!&quot; T-Shirt, and prepared for the Rapture that was definitely, positively, certainly going to happen this time. Rationalised away the non-appearance of Christ or the Rapture afterwards.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>21. You are told that your wife was seen walking in the street with another man. How do you respond?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) What's the problem? I love my wife and trust her implicitly. No doubt it was a friend or colleague from work.<br>
B) Confront her about it and find out the truth. If it was perfectly innocent, apologise for doubting her. If not, pray together for strength to overcome this.<br>
C) Set fire to her and stone her to death as an adultress. Your family may also join in.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>22. You meet someone who claims to be an atheist. How do you react to this strange notion?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) Let him/her be. I believe what I believe, and others can believe what they like. I know the truth but it's a private matter.<br>
B) Inform the person that God believes in them, even if they do not believe in God, and that you will pray for them.<br>
C) Make it your life's purpose to convert them at all costs. Pester them incessantly and bring up the subject of their salvation at every opportunity. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>23. Bonus question for Christians : How do you pronounce the name of your Lord and Saviour in everyday conversation?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A) &quot;Jesus&quot;<br>
B) &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; or &quot;Christ Jesus&quot;<br>
C) &quot;JEEEEEeeeeeh!-Zuss! Praisehisname-hallelujah!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How did you do?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you answered mostly A's, you are a believer, but you don't let it control your life. Your religion is important to you but it can take second place to family and friends. You rarely raise the subject of religion, but are happy to explain it to people if they enquire. You are a member of the vast majority of theists. <br>
<br>
If you answered mostly B's, you are a strongly religious person. Your faith is deeply important to you. You probably have few friends outside your faith. You are well-intentioned, but occasionally annoy people without realising why. You feel your country could be a better place if only more people would go to church. <br>
<br>
If you answered mostly C's, I'm afraid you are a complete kook. When you talk, people stare at you as if you have a live herring glued to your head; then they smile, nod, and back away as quickly as possible. You see the influence of Satan in everything from children's toys to baked-beans commercials. You uncritically accept anything that is presented to you, unless you feel it goes against your religious beliefs, in which case it is rejected immediately. You feel it necessary to bring Jesus into every conversation you ever have. You would like to see the government replaced by your church, and the laws replaced with those from your holy book. You will probably end up standing on a street corner, carrying a large banner that says &quot;Repent Ye For The End Is Nigh&quot;, and yelling incoherently about Jesus. Possibly, you will get your own TV show.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

&quot;The Church in the Philippines is appealing to the faithful not to crucify<br>
                                     themselves during Holy Week.<br>
<br>
                                     It says it doesn't support the Lent ritual of people nailing themselves to a<br>
                                     cross.<br>
<br>
Many Filipino people whip themselves with blades. Some are nailed to<br>
                                     crosses to repent for their sins.....................<br>
