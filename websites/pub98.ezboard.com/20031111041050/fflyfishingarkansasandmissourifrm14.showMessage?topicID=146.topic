<br>
Lots of people fish the way that you are describing. It &quot;is&quot; the best way to get a natural drift. However, it &quot;is not&quot; the most effective way to catch fish. If the indicator is upstream from the fly it has to &quot;pass&quot; the fly in order for it to get tension and then indicate a strike. If you are fishing with a 6 foot section between your fly and indicator your indicator might have to drift as much as 8 feet before you could indicate a strike. The guys in Alaska teach keeping the fly down stream from the indicator to keep a proper drift. This is completely wrong. <br>
<br>
The real secret is to balance the amount of weight. If you have the correct amount of weight your indicator will drag slightly as the shot bounces along the bottom. However, the fly will be drifting naturally since the current on the bottom is slower than the current on the top. I've included a quick drawing to illustrate what I'm talking about. Notice fish #1 will have an indication of a take almost immediately. But fish #2 will have to have the indicator travel some distance before the strike is shown.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.msnusers.com/mypicture?user=4263~5AAAAAAABE7AELpVKLbYUEw2cpu8D6N6X8eAkitL50XCHBwSjvQ!vHjw$$~5AAAAAAACGOAdkNFlfyZ5I3bEaMQ*wi5FsWbimcqbj3yA$" target="top">For Indicator Dead Drift Picture &quot;Click Here&quot;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
 <br>
I guided a man a a while back that fished exactly that method. When we first started out he was having some difficulty catching fish. We worked on changing the style of drift and he caught maybe 35 fish that afternoon. I could &quot;see&quot; the fish taking the fly but he couldn't see his indicator move so he wouldn't set the hook. Once the indicator was placed down stream of the fly he started seeing the takes.<br>

I'll add a couple of questions if you don't mind imparting some more wisdom on the subject:<br>
<br>
1) In your &quot;Fish 1&quot; scenario, even though the indicator has managed to drift downstream of the shot, wouldn't the nymph also be downstream of the shot? Except for when the drag from the indicator took over and started pulling the whole thing downstream, I would have thought the unweighted nymph would outpace the shot, even in the slower current on the bottom.<br>
<br>
2) Though I continue to like the thinking behind a shot and unweighted nymph system better than a weighted nymph only scenario, my mental &quot;picture&quot; of it was always what you've shown in the &quot;Fish 2&quot; scenario. I think I asked you some questions &quot;offline&quot; when we got back from our trip with you last spring about the likelihood of a delay in telegraphing the strike, and I realize now that we were probably thinking of two different drifts. That being said, it must be an extremely small portion of the drift where the indicator manages to be downstream, without slack, yet also not so taught as to start dragging everything. Is the key just to repeat the &quot;cycle&quot; as many times as you can - throwing mends, probably causing the indicator to return momentarily to a position upstream of the shot, but knowing that it will soon drift into the ideal position again?<br>
<br>
Like I've said before, I don't know if analytical thinking is a blessing or a curse in this sport <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , but wanted to go ahead and post it in case others were curious too. Thanks for the help, John.<br>

<br>
The key to the entire thing is the amount of weight you put above the fly. The weight is a delicate balance that allows the fly to drift naturally, while it slows the progress of the indicator down stream.<br>
<br>
Too much weight and the findicator gets pulled under. Too little weight and the indicator pulls the fly along at the speed of the surface current.<br>
<br>
The next issue is to make your cast so that the fly &quot;lands&quot; properly in relation to the indicator. If your indicator lands up stream, as soon as it passes the fly it will go under as it pulls the split shot and fly off the bottom. This is fine, if you want to make your fly jump after it sits for a second, but be prepared for the false indication of a take. Or maybe it's not false.<br>
<br>
Secondly is when your fly is off to the side of the indicator. I see people pulling the indicaotr often when they mend. They will want to allign themselves again with the current. This will often cause the fly to move off to one side as it adjusts to the indicators path. If it does this often at all a fish will not take a fly that moves sideways. Try to move everything &quot;but&quot; the indicator when you mend.<br>
<br>
John, I try to have my indicator down stream from my fly from the moment it hits the water. I feel that I often get takes as the fly sinks to the bottom. I might change it up every so often so that the fly settles, then jumps as everything comes tight. But generally it is all tight and moving together downstream at the pace of the bottom current. Flowing smoothly, not hopping.<br>
<br>
This is a little difficult to explain in the written word. Do you guys understand what I'm trying to get at here? If not please tell me and I'll do some illustrations for you.<br>

Trying to articulate this in writing probably does make it harder, and the &quot;Uh, I don't get it&quot; quotient inherent to a novice doesn't make it any easier. I appreciate as always your patience and willingness to share your knowledge.<br>
<br>
I think I follow what you're trying to describe, but like so many other things in this endeavor, the more I understand, the more questions I come up with. I understand the balance you try to strike with the shot - enough to keep it just above or occasionally ticking along the bottom, but not too much or too little for obvious reasons. But let's say you've found that balance and the weight is doing exactly what it's supposed to do - keeping the fly in that zone right off the bottom. By the description you gave, it sounds like the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>indicator</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is governing the speed of the fly - basically pulling the shot and fly downstream at the speed of the surface current. Isn't that a problem, in that the fly is drifting through the slow current on the bottom at an unnaturally fast speed? The good news (I thought) with the &quot;Fish 2&quot; scenario was that for most of the drift (assuming periodic mends), the nymph was traveling at the slower speed of the bottom current. I don't know if my attempt to type this out makes sense either, but hopefully you get my &quot;drift&quot; - pun intended. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
The fly very often &quot;does&quot; drift at an unnatural speed. Very often you will not get a take if this difference is signifigant. That's part of the difficulty is fishing deep slow pools with an indicator. However, fish will take more often than you might imagine. For years we ahve been consumed by the almighty &quot;dead drift&quot;. The most important thing about a dead drift is that your fly is on the bottom. <br>
<br>
One of the differences here might be that I generally use 6 feet of tippet from my indicator to the fly. I also use a solid length of tippet in lieu of a tapered leader. I'll have a 12 foot tapered leader to the indicator tied off. Then add the length of tippet. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>By the way this is a bugger to cast. If you are having so difficulty casting this rig shorten your length from your fly line tip to your indicator. This turns over the indicator much easier.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Fishing with a tapered leader down to your fly is much more difficult to get a slow derift from. First of all it has a much wider profile which makes it catch the surface current more. Secondly it lays horizontal in lieu of 90 degrees to the surface. This makes a curve in the line before it allows the fly to sink. This catches even more current. I also use the lightest tippet I can get away with because it has a thinner profile. I don't use 6X just because I like light tippets. It catches more fish due to its drifting characteristics as well. Lastly I use flourocarbon, which has a higher specific gravity and allows the fly to sink almost immediately.<br>
<br>
If you will reduce the amount of drag you have at the surface, drifting with your indicator down stream can still have a &quot;very&quot; effective drift. You have to play with split shot, leader length, diameter of tippet, and how often you mend, to get an effective drift. That little balancing act is alot of why people catch more fish when they are with a guide. There is a signifigant amount of success given to how the rig is prepared, besides the fly choice.<br>
