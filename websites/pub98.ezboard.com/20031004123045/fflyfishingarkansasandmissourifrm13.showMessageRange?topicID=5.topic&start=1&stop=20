<br>
The process takes a couple of hours. There will most likely be a few applicants that will be taking their tests. Chuck will have some help from other master casting instructors from around the country to do the testing. Generally he gives alot of his time to help out the Federation to test at the Sow Bug and the Conclave. You might be the only guy from Arkansas but there may be others from Texas, Missouri, Louisana, etc.<br>
<br>
I'll be happy to sit and work with you prior to the test if you like. You are an excellent caster no doubt. You are one of the best casters I've seen so you should have no trouble. I can point you to all the things I &quot;didn't&quot; know prior to getting prepared for the test. By getting prepared for testing you'll be suprised at all the things you'll learn. There are so many little &quot;facts&quot; that will make every thing easier once you know them you'd be amazed. <br>
<br>
Chuck is also an excellent teacher and will be terrific to test with. I'll have to relay my testing experience with you one of these days. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'll be on the river for several days for the next couple of weeks. Let me know when you want to get together and we'll go over some of what I didn't know prior to the test.<br>

<br>
I would suggest that you pick-up a copy of Bill Gammel's &quot;The Essentials of Casting&quot; ($2.00 from FFF) a copy of Mel Krieger's &quot;Observations on Teaching Casting&quot; ($1.00 from FFF) and a copy of Gary Borger's video tape &quot;15 Most Common Casting Errors.&quot;  (FFF about $10.00)<br>
<br>
There are several other good books and videos.<br>
<br>
I know you are a good caster, but as John has indicated, a fair amount of the test involves teaching concepts and the above and other works will help you with that aspect of the test.  By all means take time to talk with John as it helps a great deal to talk with some one who has taken the test and did quite well.<br>

I remember the actual written test taking about 20 minutes. The skills test took somewhere around an hour. you just have to methodically step through all the trials. The hour will go fast I can tell you that.

<br>
The 20 foot target is exactly the point. Who would have thought &quot;anyone&quot; could have trouble with that? First I took equipment that was not really suited to take the test with. Looking back I can see several mistakes I made even before I got started. You'll need to work on casting skills that are fairly well across the board. The test is more about fundamentals than specific skills. Like you said how long has it been since you carried 40 feet of line with no haul and had to throw &quot;zero&quot; tailing loops. Now do it with a couple of guys watching and grading you.<br>
<br>
The test is not terribly difficult, but it is no cake walk either. Even an accomplished caster like you Andrew will need to prepare before taking it. With that done you'll have no problems at all. You are an excellent caster and will make a wonderful instructor. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I was having some real issues with the rings for some reason. With the 25' ring I wouldn't let my rod come down with the line. Every time I'd hit the ring the line would go slack and yank the fly out of the ring. I was using a light presentation fly line and there was a little wind also. One of the targets I'd miss because either the wind would blow it out or I'd just miss all together. You'd think it would be easy but it took me all the chances I had to get it done. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I talked to Steve Rajeff about casting after watching him cast during the Great Outdoor Games fly fishing tournament in 2001.  He had the best casting style for accuracy in the wind.  He would make a standard backcast a little high, then come forward with something like a stab cast, driving the fly into the target, very tournament style.(similar to double hauling with 20' of line like it is 40', just angled at the target)  If anyone tried to do it while fishing, they would scare the water out of the river.  I thought he was going to DESTROY the targerts I had taken so much time to build.  I do it when &quot;tournament casting,&quot; and it works great and very, very accurate.<br>

<br>
From what I've heard, you're a great caster.  It's been 7 or 8 years since I took the test, and I know the format has changed.  When I took it, I finished the written first among 11 total applicants.  It took me almost 2-1/2 hours.  But there were numerous essay questions, and those can take as much time as you want to devote to them.  I actually erased an entire page of writing to say the same thing, more simply.  Kinda like Reverend MacLean telling Norman, &quot;again, half as long....&quot;  Only three applicants passed the written test.<br>
<br>
If I could offer a firm piece of advice, please concentrate most of your preparation time analyzing casters and practicing your coaching skills.  As you know, it takes different approaches to communicate effectively with different individuals.  This was the downfall of the other two applicants when I tested.  They were not able to satisfy the Masters administering the oral/performance test that they were proficient at actually instructing others.  They were fine casters, and I believe both of them have been certified since.  I don't think that the ratio of applicants who fail are this low in general, I believe today's applicants are much better prepared than for some of the early tests.<br>
<br>
Truly, I hope it is a cakewalk for you.  This would mean that you're very capable of handling just about any teaching opportunity you'd come across in a relaxed fashion.  From what I've seen, the applicants that have the most difficulty passing the tests, also have the most trouble as an effective casting instructor.  Not across the board, but generally.  The more confident (not cocky) you are in your skill testing and instruction testing, the more likely you'll pass with flying colors.<br>
<br>
If you are at Sowbug next weekend, I hope to meet you.  Good luck.  TAM<br>
<br>
P.S. - The entire written and two practical tests that I took in 95 lasted at least 5 hours or more total.  Maybe three hours one day, and then 2 hours on another day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyfishar>FlyFishAR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#000000>(3/19/03 8:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://boards.justflies.com/Images/4/4551Photo1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CCI Test</span><hr size=1> TAM:<br>

I think the pass/fail ratio is still pretty much the same. The written had some real head scratchers for me but when I look back they were obvious questions. The secret is being prepared. Andrew if you want I'll spend some time with you prior to the test.<br>

I haven't really decided on when I might give it a try.  Maybe next summer (2004).  Obviously, I've got some work to do first...<br>

You'd make an excellent master also, when are you going for it?  Make you a deal.  I'll shoot for it the same time you do.  Maybe at least one of us will make it...<br>
