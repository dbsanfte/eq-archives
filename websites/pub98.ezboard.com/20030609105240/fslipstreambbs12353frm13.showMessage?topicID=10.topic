<br>
They never thought it would come to this. On the Eureka Maru, the crew watched in horror as the Andromeda Ascendant started collapsing in two, with a bright light erupting from it, before exploding into millions of shiny pieces. Dylan wouldn't let the tears in his eyes drop, but it was plain to see he felt like sobbing and swearing in all his fury at the bastards who killed her. Harper, on the other hand, couldn't hide his sorrow. The more he kept replaying what had happened the more the felt the pain in his stomach. The ship had been sabotaged by some anonymous crew members, who had rebelled against them. They set a timer and left like the cowards they were, in escape pods. When they found out, the crew had less than a minute to get the hell out of there, and into the Maru. It was the most stupidest, pathetic reason for the Andromeda to be destroyed, but it happened anyway. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's not fair...&quot; Harper whispered through clenched teeth. Rommie came up besides him and gave the boy a hug.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's going to be ok.&quot; she assured, rubbing his back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Beka... slipstream to commonwealth space.&quot; Dylan ordered gloomily, never taking his eyes off the view screen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Say good-bye, everyone.&quot; At her words, Harper let out another sob. Beka waited before leaving... she, like the others, missed their ship -their home- already. But she *was* home, she kept telling herself. Then again, the Andromeda became her second dwelling, her shelter, in the long run. She felt just as upset.<br>
<br>
&quot;G'bye... Andromeda.&quot; Trance said.<br>
<br>
Appearing indifferent, Tyr walked out of the cockpit. Dylan, ever silent, kept staring at his warship's remains.<br>
<br>
&quot;Slipstreaming...&quot; she announced with a sigh. They left the system, and the Andromeda to her grave...<br>
<br>
****days later****<br>
<br>
The small skeleton crew of no more than a dozen were to move in a new warship, which already had a crew of four thousand, waiting for them. The ship itself was quite similar to Andromeda, but its complexion was slightly different. In with the new ship came a new avatar as well, called Allie. Dylan, Harper, Beka and Trance made sure Rommie was to stay with them, even if she didn't have a purpose as big as she used to... when she used to be a warship. Now, it seemed, she the walking memory of the Andromeda. The change was an odd experience. At first, no one was too happy.  The ship was so busy and unfamiliar.<br>
<br>
Harper wasn’t as thrilled as he used to be, like when he’d fix the Andromeda. He wasn’t as energetic and chipper as he used to be either. It was all a big mess. Emotionally drained, he simple didn’t want to work.<br>
<br>
Trance was looking on the positive side of things, even if her smiles were forced, and her good humor fake... She decided that, she might as well try to get used to her new home. Her solution; taking elements from the Maru that she loved, and bringing them in her new environment. In other words; decorate her crew quarters with plants. The moment she entered through the door to get them, she heard a very loud and unpleasant belch.<br>
<br>
There was Harper, drinking beer out of... What *was* that? Trance approached him, as he kept jugging the liquid down. <br>
<br>
&quot;Harper! That's not a beer mug that's a flower vase!&quot; she exclaimed. As he moved it away from his face and looked at it, he noticed it did look pretty fancy...<br>
<br>
“It is? ...Would ya look at that... it is.” he said in a very dull manner.<br>
<br>
“Harper, what are you doing?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“I’m drowning my depression. What does it look like.”<br>
<br>
“You’re gunna have to accept it Harper. This is your new home now.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t wan a new home Trance! I want the Andromeda back...” His lip started to tremble, so he took another swing of his beer. Trance kept telling him everything would be back to normal soon, but in the end, she was talking to herself more than him. Harper caught on to that, by just watching her get all agitated. Finally, she took a breath, giving Harper a chance to speak. “C’mon Trance, sulk with me.”<br>
<br>
She let out a sigh, and plopped down on a chair next to him. “Give me that.” she said, gazing on her flower vase. She looked inside. It was half empty. “Alright, we finish this, then we decorate my room. Deal?”<br>
<br>
He agreed. Maybe it wasn’t going to be so bad after all...<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As Tyr was walking down the corridors, he kept looking around, as if he was lost. He wouldn’t admit it but, he was. There were many people walking around as well, but what kind of Nietzschean would ask for directions? Back on the Andromeda, he knew where things and places were. And there weren’t all these strangers walking around. Only a couple, from time to time. Where was that bloody gym anyways? <br>
<br>
Later on he found a room with two big doors. Was that it? What if it wasn’t? If it wasn’t, who ever would be in there would know the Nietzschean was lost. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>How pathetic</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought.  But what did he care what others thought? He entered.<br>
<br>
It was as he thought, it was the ship’s gym. He was glad that he found it, but upset at the one inconvenient; all those strangers again! He felt like they were invading his territory. He glared angrily at all the puny, inferior beings that were working out on his turf. As everyone fixed the resident Nietzschean, silently growling at them and flexing his muscles, they got the point and, slowly, one by one, left. The occasional “Well I think I’m done here.” and  “Gee, I’m hungry let’s go to the mess ok?” was heard, as they hurried out.<br>
<br>
He made himself known. The others would give him his space, and everyone would be happy. Maybe he could get used to this new place after all. Besides, it felt self-gratifying to see them all scurry away from him like they did. It was actually funny...<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Beka wouldn’t leave the Maru unless she was needed on command, or to see her friends. She hadn’t personalized her crew quarters, she hadn’t even looked in them yet. How could she call that ship a home with all those people she didn’t even know, lurking around every corner. What she loved about the Andromeda was that there were so little people, she could make every member of it her family in some way. When the new crew came on board, it wasn’t so bad. They weren’t many, and it was them who were the newcomers in her home, not the other way around. She started thinking that this was what it must’ve been like to them... She actually felt like leaving this new ship herself, just like they had done with the Andromeda. But Beka wasn’t stupid. Not like them. <br>
<br>
The crew members who didn’t know about the little rebellion, and were still among the others, seemed out of place as well, she noticed. They too were unused to being around this much people. Some had sheepishly  asked to come on board her ship, just to hang out. It gave her a chance to get to know them a bit. She actually enjoyed their company.<br>
<br>
“...Beka? Are you... busy?”<br>
<br>
Beka smiled at the woman, knowing how she must feel. She didn’t even know her name, but at least she recognized her. “Don’t like the new ship either, huh?” she greeted warmly. The older woman seemed to relax, they both had something in common, for sure, since they boarded the new warship. Conversation came easily, as they complained about how much they hated busy places, and how they missed the Andromeda. Others came in later on also, and soon Beka had her hands full with company.<br>
<br>
She hated to admit it, but if it weren’t for the incident on the Andromeda, she wouldn’t have gotten to know these people she had been ignoring for the passed few months. In a way, it wasn’t so bad...<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
“Rommie.” Dylan accidentally called the ship.<br>
<br>
Allie appeared instead. “Are you referring to me, Captain?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, sorry, uh...”<br>
<br>
“Allie.” she reminded for the third time that day.<br>
<br>
“Allie! Of course... Look, I’m sorry, but it’ll take some getting used to.” he muttered.<br>
<br>
“Is there something you needed?” she asked.<br>
<br>
Now that Dylan thought of it, he didn’t really know why he called her. In the back of his mind, he knew he wasn’t calling this new ship’s avatar, he was calling for the ship he lost. So, he really hadn’t called for Allie...<br>
<br>
“Uh... No. No I, don’t need anything...”<br>
<br>
“Are you sure?”<br>
<br>
“Yes... No wait! Where’s Rommie?”<br>
<br>
“Rommie is in the observation deck, Sir.”<br>
<br>
At his nod, she shimmered away. He left his new, and very empty office, and went to see her. Rommie was the closest thing -person- he had. Going to see her made them both happy. As long as she was around, he would stay that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
