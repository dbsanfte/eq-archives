Qninde, seeing that Monoco clearly wasn't comfortable with the subject, replied &quot;All right&quot; and reluctantly looked back at his uneaten meal.  Perhaps she would tell him more when they were better aquainted; he wouldn;t risk pushing her and he really didn't want to lose one of his only contacts in this unfamiliar world.<br>
<br>
At that point, someone collided with him, dropping all their food in the process.  His hair and eyes flourished orange, and he loked down, surprised.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry,&quot; said the girl, who had bright red hair and looked to be about sixteen or seventeen.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is alright,&quot; replied Qninde politely, while looking back on Monoco to see what her reaction to this sudden encounter was. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/7/03 12:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm41.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Just a Picture</span><hr size=1> OOC: Nothing to do with the RPG, just showing off Qninde's illustration that I did straight onto the comp with a tablet pen.

Qninde watched this exchange and hoped that the girl wouldn't be too offended by the questionable value of the food being offered to her, and then wondered if he was being too picky about the things that humans usually ate.  Most of it was quite good, but...  He decided to table the subject for later.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is your name?&quot; he asked the mysterious girl, shyly. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://i.mediaminer.org:81/far/140744.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flcoex>FLCO EX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/7/03 2:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm41.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eminem.com/images/gallerythumbs/new_4_th.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> To Animagess</span><hr size=1> OOC: Don't worry, I can wait.
