&quot;Yukari...don't cry...&quot; he whispered, his green eyes shining with concern.<br>

&quot;Yukari...your soul is pure...and I was drawn to you because of that. And I'd rather spend the life I have here with you - even without the love - with your pure soul - than go back to Heaven to lose it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soulds like yours are rare, Yukari... but love an angel can feel instantly - especially with a human - is even rarer.&quot;<br>
<br>
He took a shuddering breath, readying himself for denial. &quot;Yukari, all I want now...the least I want...is to know how you feel about me... Do you want me to stay, or leave? Because as angel...I must follow the orders of one with a pure soul...&quot; He looked at her with wistful, green eyes. &quot;And I am an angel.&quot; <br>
<br>
With that, the light engulfed them, and in the flurry of feathers, he had transformed back into his real state. Silvery-white hair, ice-blue eyes, tall stature, and feathery white wings. An angel in every way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#8B0000>(3/10/03 1:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm93.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: awwwww!</span><hr size=1> Hearning that...

Hold it, and wherever you truly want me to be, I will go. The hard part...is not over yet.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you wish me to be in Heaven, I will no logner be able to go to Earth or Hell. Heaven will be my domain forever. If you wish for me to be on Earth with you, I cannot go to Heaven - and I will be an outcast to all angels everywhere, forever. If you wish me to be in Hell, I will dissapear because angels can't enter Hell without the word of God.<br>
<br>
&quot;And if you gave me the freedom to commute between places, it would mean that my most powerful form, the seraph, which you saw in The Void, would be lost forever. That would mean..I would be exiled from Heaven - never allowed to return, because I couldn't get through The Void, which is the portal to Heaven from Earth and Hell.&quot;<br>
<br>
He made sure she held the crucifix tightly. &quot;The crucifix will eventually realize who I gave my lfie and heart to - and will tell me where you want me to be even without you telling it anything. There's no getting out of this situation...anymore, Yukari...&quot;<br>

It was painful. More painful than his death when he was actually human so long ago. The ache spread from his soul to every nerve in his body. Every synapse leaped for no more pain, but it was all in vain.<br>
<br>
He shut his eyes tightly, and it seemed as though a brick wall went right through his body. Hard. He made a small noise of pain, and fell on his knees.<br>

&quot;Just great Yukari... you've screwed something again.&quot; She told herself as she too, dropped to her knees.<br>
<br>
Her hands she placed, one on each shoulder... and looked at Ayashi as if she were going to loose him already.<br>

And suddenly, it was gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;She is the one who now holds your heart and life, dear host Ayashi?&quot; a new, British/French-accented voice sounded.<br>
<br>
Ayashi opened his eyes to see a figure that looked exactly like him...except his eyes were steely, and his face was emotionless. And he had six wings. The seraph part of Ayashi. His strongest power. He had only brought his powers to surface so far only once - sometime in the 17th century - protecting Calencoriel...<br>
<br>
&quot;You're me...&quot; he said softly, sitting up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I am,&quot; said the Seraph-Ayashi. &quot;The Crucifix of our Lord has given its orders...via this pretty young woman who...has the purest soul I've ever seen...&quot; The Seraph glided over to Yukari, and tilted her chin with his transparent hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Her soul is surprisingly clean...&quot; said the Seraph.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean surprisingly?&quot; asked Ayashi, getting on his knees.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's been lots of despair in her life, giving but not receiving, but she still managed to maintain her pureness with which she was born. Amazing,&quot; explained the Seraph. He let go of Yukari, and glided up in the air above them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure this is what you've both decided on?&quot; asked Seraph Ayashi.<br>
<br>
Ayashi looked at Yukari, waiting for her to answer.<br>
