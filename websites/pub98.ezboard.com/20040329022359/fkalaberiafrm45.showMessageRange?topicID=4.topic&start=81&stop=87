When she was done she picked up her own wine glass from the counter and switched off the light, leaving the room in shadow.<br>
<br>
While they were eating Jay had kicked off her shoes, getting comfortable, and now as she padded barefoot across the open space of the main room, she made almost no sound. She could see Zack sitting on the couch looking out the large windows, a small pool of light the only illumination, off to one side. <br>
<br>
Coming up behind him, Jay could see her reflection in the glass, sure that he could as well. And as she got close she reached out a hand ruffling his hair before sitting down next to him. &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; The words slipped out before she knew she'd even said them. A blush stained Jayden's cheeks as she looked down into her wine glass. 'How could I be so stupid?' she asked herself, 'it's none of my business.' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> Posts: 45<br> <font color=#8B4513>(2/3/04 7:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Zack wrapped his arm around her and pulled her light form against his side while taking a sip of wine from the glass in his other hand. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Just what am I thinking about?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he mused to himself silently as he tried to gather up an answer for her. Zack might be one of the toughest vampires around but that did not mean he would not express himself when it came to the thoughts deep inside his mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... just look out there... burnt... toppling skyscrapers... Starless sky and not even the moon's light can burn through that haze... Nothing out there makes me see this world as beautiful anymore.&quot; he spoke softly to her, his head resting lightly against hers. After another sip of his wine, he cleared his throat and continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;As a vampire I have looked upon the same landscape for some years, never imagining that one day it would be like this. From here I could sense the very life this city was glowing in. Streets filled with traffic and people, skyscrapers light up against the stary sky. You could see the moon chase shadows across my suite's floor as it traveled across the sky...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But now the only thing in this world that reminds me of the beauty it can still have is you...&quot; he spoke almost as a whisper into her ear. &quot;In the middle of this crumbling city I came across a fragile flower who's only chance was if it was protected and nurished. I won't see you die Jayden... You will not become dust and join the rest of the dead city as long as I can do something about it. That I promise you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Softly Zack turned Jayden's chin in his hand so she was looking up at him in the dimly lit room. His moist lips sought hers and in a gentle caress he kissed her passionatly before pulling away and licking the taste of her wine from his lips. &quot;Of course... eventually there will be a decision you will have to make beautiful... And I think you know what decision that is...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> Posts: 46<br> <font color=#8B4513>(2/4/04 11:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=83>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Allowing herself to be pulled, unresisting into Zack's arms, Jayden snuggled against him. He always seemed to make her feel at ease when he touched her. She listened to him talk, his head resting along side her own, as he told her his thoughts of this ruined city they lived in. It all seemed somehow so....normal. <br>
<br>
As he spoke intimately, close to Jay's ear, she felt Zack's breath tickle her skin, making her nerve ending tingle. Then he turned her, and her eyes met his as he leaned down caressing her lips softly with his own. When he pulled away, Jayden's disappointment was soon forgotten as she heard his next words, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Of course... eventually there will be a decision you will have to make beautiful... And I think you know what decision that is...&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Jayden couldn't hide the fear that rippled through her at those words. She looked up into Zack's face, searching it for a moment. She'd almost forgotten what he was. &quot;Y-yes, I know....but I'm not ready to make that decision...yet,&quot; she answered softly. She knew by his words that it wasn't a question of 'if' but more the question of 'when.'  <br>
<br>
&quot;Please, promise me..' she asked looking into those incredible blue eyes, 'that the decision will be mine.&quot; Jayden caught her lips between her teeth as she waited tensely. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> Posts: 46<br> <font color=#8B4513>(2/10/04 6:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Zack looked into her eyes as she spoke, listening intently to each word that she spoke. He understood everything she said to him and took it all to heart, promising to himself that he would grant her that wish. &quot;But of course Jayden, I will give you the choice as well as decide the time if you do allow me to sire you. It is not a simple decision to make for it can not be reversed... and it will effect your whole life for the rest of your life...&quot;<br>
<br>
He tried to calm her with a charming smile, showing how honest he was in allowing everything to be her decision. But he knew with how the world was turning, she could not leave the decision for to long. With everything that he was into, the lifestyle she lead would require beyond normal means from her. She would be able to remain by his side a lot longer as a vampire, however he would not force her.<br>
<br>
Zack pulled her into his arms more snuggly and kissed her forehead softly, his eyes looking back out the window again. &quot;If you have any questions at all about it... about what its like to be a vampire... I'm your source you know...&quot; he gave her a teasing look as his hand moved softly down her neck, over her breasts to rest on her stomach. His lips sought out hers again in a fond kiss as he held her close to him, allowing her the freedom to decide what she wanted to do with him now, or rather what she wanted him to do to her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> Posts: 47<br> <font color=#8B4513>(2/17/04 11:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=85>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> After their kiss ended Jayden looked down into her glass watching the liquid swirl slowly around the inside. She would have liked nothing more then to lose herself in the feel of Zack's hands as they trailed down her body, igniting her desire, and forget this conversation ever happened. But he'd given her an opening that she couldn't ignore. <br>
<br>
'How often did a vampire offer to tell you anything you wanted to know?' she thought a slight smile forming on her lips, 'for that matter how often did one sit cuddling and drinking wine with a vampire.' Even Jay knew Zack was no ordinary Vampire. And though the thought of being turned frightened her, if it were to happen she wouldn't want it to be with any other then him. What she feared most was not being like him, but turning out like the vamps that scavenged the city, killing and torturing for sport. She wasn't sure what made them different from Zack, but she'd rather be dead if she ended up like them.<br>
<br>
Taking a sip, Jay leaned forward setting her glass down next to the bottle. As she sat back, she turned to the man beside her, and taking a breath asked, &quot;You'd tell me anything? About how it happened to you? Will you tell me that?...&quot; she trailed off, not sure if it was even alright to ask, but curious none the less. Then adding as an almost afterthought, &quot;A-And can you tell me what makes you and the Vampires we met tonight different then the ones out there?&quot; Jayden fervently hoped that Zack could give her a reason.<br>
<br>
******************************************<br>
<br>
Meanwhile on the other side of town a pair of cold brown eyes looked up as two men stepped cautiously into the run down room, following their progress as they moved closer  &quot;Did you find her?&quot; a harsh voice asked. &quot;Sorry Tommy, we looked everywhere,&quot; the closest man answered.<br>
<br>
Tommy sat quietly contemplating the other man's words, his eyes studying the peeling paint on the closest wall, before they swung back to his companions. Booted feet slid off the low table in front of him with a thud, and he stood up, &quot;Well obviously you couldn't have looked everywhere....because you didn't find the bitch.&quot; Reaching down he grabbed his coat, sliding his arms in and shrugging it over his shoulders, &quot;She'll show up sooner or later. Where the hell else is she gonna go?&quot; he smirked, &quot;Come on, we've wasted enough time. It'll be Jay's own fault if something happens to her.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A> at: 2/18/04 10:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> Posts: 47<br> <font color=#8B4513>(2/24/04 8:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Zack smiled at her questions, a simple nod of his head as he understood what she was asking. It did not bother him that she seemed nosy of his past, after all he had opened himself up for that in the first place. The vampire took another sip of his wine before relaxing back into the couch with her pulled close against himself as he formed a reply in his head. His siring had taken place a few years ago, quite a few actually but he could remember it all as if it had just happened a minute ago.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... it was a long time, way before you were even born.&quot; Zack smiled down at Jayden as he began to speak. &quot;I was but a mortal version of the one you have before you now. Of course I have matured over the years... sort of. I was a young, foolish and thinking I was invinvible. Picking fights was something I did on a constant level... always winning to.Well that was until one night.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zack took a deep breath as though pausing to carefully word what he was going to say next. &quot;I picked a fight with the wrong people... I was foolish in not admitting defeat against him and kept at him... turns out he was a vampire. He beat me into a mess I can tell you... but instead of killing me he sired me. As he told me, I reminded him of who he used to be and desired that I learn how to be more civil and use this desire to fight for good. Yes fighting can be used for good...&quot; Zack smirked down at her as he kissed her cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was a shock to me to be sired... took me a while to adjust to my new strengths, and weaknesses. But the strong desire to succeed and never give up saw me through. But my sire left me after he had trained me as far as he felt nessesary, saying that I now had to learn everything else the world had to offer on my own. Which explains how I ended up here I suppose. New York was always a place of interest to me and I had been informed that a few vampires lived here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The ones you met earlier are vampires I knew before all this... smog rolled in and ruined the day. We are vampires that desire peace and will use force to obtain it if needed. Like humans, there are good vampires and bad vampires. People do not judge humans on a whole as evil... humans kill animals for food... Vampires feed to survive. Its all the same in the end if you can see the big picture clearly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My kind of vampire is the kind that enjoys a calm unity with humans, living with them as though we are all the same. We will fight any vampire, were or human that wishs to destroy the peace we strive for. We have money, power and strength in numbers... In my guidence my beautiful Jayden, you will not become like them... You will be like us...&quot; Zack finished and gazed quietly down at her, an almost teasing look in his eye that could suggest he was done talking and wanted to play. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> Posts: 48<br> <font color=#8B4513>(2/28/04 11:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=87>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live (Mature Content)</span><hr size=1> Jayden weighed Zack's words as he spoke, thankful that he had told her as much as he had, it helped ease the panic she had felt. She had more questions but as she looked up into his eyes, she could tell his thoughts had wandered to other things. It was late, or early, depending on how you looked at it, and she was sure that she could always come back to this subject at some other time.<br>
<br>
As she looked into Zack's eye's, Jay gave him a mischievous smile, running her hand up his chest to rest on his shoulder. Next she leaned up and stopped, her lips inches from his, &quot;Thank you for telling me about what happened to you,&quot; she said letting her finger's toy with the edges of his hair, &quot;but now,&quot; her head moved to where her lips brushed his ear, &quot;I get the feeling there are other things on your mind.&quot;<br>
