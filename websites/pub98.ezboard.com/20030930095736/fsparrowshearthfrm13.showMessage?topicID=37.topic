As for me...<br>
<br>
Behavior and Emotions - my dot was on the second line above the middle.<br>
<br>
Responsibility - my dot was smack dab in the middle.<br>
<br>
In the area of behavior, you seem to fall into the &quot;adult&quot; category. Adults tend to be efficient and responsible. You are probably a &quot;doer&quot; whom others consider reliable, stable, and consistent. People feel they can depend on you. Of course, if others rely too much on you, it can be a burden. You seem, however, to be someone who strikes a healthy balance between fulfilling others' needs and taking care of your own. Just be aware that if you feel overwhelmed by the pressures put on you, you should take some time out for yourself.<br>
<br>
In the realm of emotions, you seem to fall into the &quot;adult&quot; category. This means that you are probably in control of your emotions. You can recognize your feelings and express them clearly. You are probably rational and composed, but you make sure that you do not neglect your own emotions. This healthy balance allows you to interact well with others, while staying true to yourself.<br>
<br>
When it comes to the level of responsibility you assume, you fall into the &quot;adolescent&quot; category. This means that you might not be someone who is considered dependable, except perhaps in a crisis. Adolescents typically have little concern for the consequences of their own actions and avoid most commitments. This tendency is not conducive to developing trusting and enduring relationships <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>

<br>
Behavior:<br>
There are countless reasons why people may act or feel a certain age at any given point in their lives. Feeling a certain age is not a static thing, nor is it something that always follows a pre-determined pattern. Some people act older when they are children then have a second childhood in their retirement years. Others act like children until they become parents and then seem to click into a different mode. It can be helpful and insightful to learn which stage you're at right now, and why.<br>
<br>
Nobody fits neatly into a given category. There are several components in your emotional age: behavior, emotion, and responsibility. In the area of behavior, you seem to fall very clearly into the "mature" category. There is no doubt that others can rely on you and that your behavior is probably consistent and dependable. This is great, but it probably also means that you don't allow yourself to have too much fun or act "outside the box." Most of your actions might be dictated by how they are going to affect other people. Basically, you might want to lighten up a little. Try to focus more on your own feelings. And, most of all -- have a little fun!<br>
<br>

Dot was two points above the middle.<br>

Emotions:<br>
In the realm of emotions, you seem to fall into the "adult" category. This means that you are probably in control of your emotions. You can recognize your feelings and express them clearly. You are probably rational and composed, but you make sure that you do not neglect your own emotions. This healthy balance allows you to interact well with others, while staying true to yourself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dot was one point above the middle.<br>
<br>
Responsibility:<br>
When it comes to the level of responsibility you assume, for yourself or others, you fall into the "adult" category. This means that you are probably someone who can be relied on to come through in any situation. People around you likely consider you dependable and strong. Don't let your dominant care-taking side force you to neglect your own needs. Keep a healthy balance and continue to take care of yourself too. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man.<br>

In the realm of emotions, you seem to fall into the &quot;kid&quot; category. This means that you probably express your emotions instinctively. In many ways that's great, because you are in touch with your feelings. You're probably considered open and honest by those around you. But it can also mean that you practice little control over your public expression. Being an emotional &quot;kid&quot; can also indicate insensitivity to the needs of others. Children are naturally emotionally self-absorbed and tend to not be aware of the effect their actions have on others. It's a two-sided coin. Allowing your emotions to surface is a wonderful healing process, but it's important to control when and where these &quot;expressions&quot; occur.<br>
