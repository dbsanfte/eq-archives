I only require a few things from those who wish to sign up.<br>
<br>
First things first, I am going to need a Profile<br>
<br>
Name:<br>
Age:<br>
Height:<br>
Weight:<br>
Hair/Eye color:<br>
Race:<br>
Deity:<br>

Personality/motivation:<br>
Abilities: (3-5 max depending on amount of magic)<br>
Single use/Limit break type ability:<br>

<br>
The only thing I ask for in profiles are NO God characters. I want this thread to be as legit as possible. That doesn't mean I necessarily want expert roleplayers. But the objective of this thread isn't victory or defeat. Rather the objective here is the story. So regard any fighting as more of a sparring match or a dance. <br>
<br>
1.) Have a weakness<br>
2.) Do not post anothers persons actions without their consent. Also allow your actions to give your opponent a counter action.<br>
3.) Do not be invulnerable to attack, fatigue, etc etc. <br>
4.) Do not be able to miraculously recover from any injury. Fact is I would like to see a character or so die! A character can always be revived for a later story, and you are allowed to have more than one character/profile! However, only the actor/roleplayer can consent for their character to be killed. Even the storyteller is over-ruled here.<br>
5.) Please please please do not roleplay ridiculously strong characters without consent from the storyteller.<br>
6.) I have no problem with people being able to fly, or teleport. But I want these abilities kept on a REALLY short leash. You can only fly for a very limited amount of time, and teleporting can only be done for very short distances at the expenditure of ALOT of energy. If you can teleport, then you can't do it without consequence.<br>
<br>
All profiles will be approved by myself and selected others. If your profile is not approved, then you shall be summarily &quot;banned&quot; and ignored by everyone in this thread. <p>Don't fear that which you do not know I wont hurt you</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goergyboy>Goergyboy</A> at: 10/2/03 4:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coolrain@goergyboysroleplayingpalace>coolrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/2/03 7:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fgoergyboysroleplayingpalacefrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Character</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.gamespy.com/avatars/av/MA/ma1486.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

History: Ronan, was born in a small mining village, in a ireland like place. Near a large forest, yet it was always under attack by nighboring tribes and villages for the mines.  He is 1/4th demon. His Father 1/2 demon, even though he was half demon, no one knew, and he had become a powerful official of the state. His mother was normal, and still loved him though she knew he was part demon. Unfortunately, Ronans father couldnt let them live with him, because he was already married, and not the most honest of men. Though Ronan also had a brother, from a diffrent father,Owen. Ronans mother and Owen then were sent to live in the small town of Villeh, unfortunately, Ronans white hair and enlonged K-9's showed the towns folk he was part demon, and they banished him. So he had to live in an abandoned mine.<br>
 He had nothing to do all day, but work, he found an old pick in the mine, and spent day after day picking away at the mines, for no reason, just working out.. extending his home, maybe even find a treasure.When not doing that he would be sititng at his little fire out infront of teh cave, listening to the animals, even finding he had a bit of a connection, he learned and began to be able to summon the creatures.Owen, would stop by everyday, no matter what, bringing food, talking, playing. They grew closer then any other brothers could, never fighting, more then family. Own joined in with the mining, and they spend hours on end, in the mines swining picks. Soon the caves were thought to be haunted from the almost constant sounds of the digging, echoing through the darkness of the cave. Once day, Ronan and Owens mother died, from her old age. Owen just moved in with ronan, and they dug daily, Dispite Owen being quite a few years older, Ronan was incrediably stronger, not jsutfrom his demonic heritage but from working in the mines, nearly nonstop. They two brother learned things of all sorta, from travels going by.. Paladins, Theives, barbarians, knights, even horriable creatures, They would take tips, and train for the breifest moment with each, becoming stronger, to fight off the nighboring tribes, who constantly attacked for the mines. Years, and years went by they had great times, along with the bad, They'd finally struck Metal, and when not mining they were building their forge, and made weapons, armor, training tools, anything they could use or sell. But while they were working, some greedy men come into their cave, and tried to steal the mine, Owen and Ronan, fought them off, but got separated in the now large cave, from all the mining work, and soon the men ran off. Ronan only found his brothers crossow and a finger on its trigger. Enraged he suited up, and set out after the men. late in the night he stalked them, waiting for them to fall asleep. He saw about 6 men leave the camp in a hury on hoursback, but he didnt pay attention, he focused on the camp, then slid down the hill form the forest. He went into tent after tent cutting their throats until a guard saw and called out. Ronan ran out, and soon the camp was filled with arrows and daggers flying through the air. By sunrise Ronan stood bloody, breathing heavily, as the bodies of those who killed his brother laid on the ground. He picked up his daggers, and headed back to his home. With no more family, and no reason to stay he sold everything, and now travels around killing anyone who he thinks might be one of the 6 riders that escaped his fury. He also takes jobs, killing tribes causing trouble, for fees. Almost an assisan, almost heartless, and almost Enjoying it.  He still took lessons from whom he could, specilizing in the Dark arts, of making False images of himself, even fading into the darkness so no man could see him. As he killed more and more Ronan soon was just known as The Shadow Wolf. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/alexthegreat8994/images/shadowolfav.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid73/p45f9511025714dc45f2d3023ca36f924/fb78d16e.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/alexthegreat8994/images/shadowolfav.gif "/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
