This idea is feasible and I'm confident it would receive highly favorable approval ratings if a poll were taken  from tribal members. Now is the time to consider it since elections are only a year away.  This idea would not only create equal representation for all members but would also provide needed objectivity within the boards present make-up of only local members in the UP area.

Understanding that we are a people whose identity is in great part our relationship with specific places. I live very far from Sugar Island, but it and our tribe is my home. <br>
<br>
Not that we need to completely copy the US way of doing things (or any other government for that matter) but I do not see at large US Senators or congressmen. When we serve in other states or other countries we still vote in our local election for Govenor, or state reps of our home of record. Our tribe is my home of record and if I should choose to offer my services as an elected official, I would surely expect to be living within our districts.<br>

As examples, the Chippewa, as did many other tribes of the region, had different homes, the occupation of which was dependent upon the season of the year.  The summer home where agriculture was conducted certainly was different and possibly remote from the winter habitation where hunting and trapping activities occupied much time.  An ancestor of mine, Joseph-Louis Ainnse, a prominent Ojibwa chief of the late 18th and early 19th century divided his time between the Quebec City and Mackinac areas.  Moreover, the modern-day Sault Tribe conducts business at locations remote from the U.P. service area, the Greektown Casino being the most obvious example.  But there have been proposals and investments for tribal businesses as far away as the U.S. Gulf coast.  <br>
<br>
I am less concerned about establishing at-large representatives than I am about the number required for the fair and equitable representation of all tribal members.  The U.P., with approximately 20 percent of the membership, has 12 Board seats. A proportionate allocation of seats to members living outside the service area would provide an additional 60 Board members at-large which, of course, is an outrageous suggestion. Outrageous mainly because it seems that the present 12 Board members have a difficult time agreeing on some important items; add another 60 voices to that mix and chaos would take on an entirely new meaning.  But one at-large seat seems to be, to me at least, not enough.  Perhaps 2-4 at-large seats would be a workable number.  I would be very surprised if a majority of members living outside the service area would reject the idea.  And now seems to be an appropriate time to raise it.<br>

But I still disagree. It may add something if I clarify what I meant by our tribal identity is geographic. <br>
<br>
Our Nation (tribal) exists physically within specific areas of the United States of America. It is our relationship with our ancient lands (I really do not mean New Foundland or Nova Scotia by the way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )that help us know our selves, anything that makes it possible to continue our existence on those lands, or that encourages us to live there, is, in my opinion, to be fostered and helped.  You probably know, and I do know, of tribal members who live in isolation from the tribal main-stream and are &quot;playing&quot; their tribal identity by guess work and generalized ideas about what being an American Indian or who we are as a people. <br>
<br>
So, long winded as this whole thing is, I just can not comprehend how our government should operate with 'at-large' directors. I honestly do not expect material or financial rewards from my tribal membership, so long as I make my life outside of what we now call our service areas. That being said, the existence of this tribe rewards me spiritually and culturally.<br>
<br>
I have a feeling I haven't come straight to the point here. But that is the enormous value of this forum! This dialogue helps me form my opinions, and helps me participate in the day to day life of my tribe!<br>
<br>
A greater part of what Federal recognition of our tribe means to me is the encouragement to (re-)build, sustain and grow our individual and tribal identity through language, culture and revitalization of our core values, and assist in the process of a healthy and on-going development of that identity, within the boundaries of our treaty lands.  <br>
<br>
As far as I learned from my father and from historical accounts, Anishnabeg are a culture based on blood ties and origin points have (and have) never recognized &quot;race,&quot; of any kind as a real thing.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsaulttribe.showUserPublicProfile?gid=egoboy@saulttribe>egoboy</A> at: 8/18/03 9:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFF0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsaulttribe.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aesahc>aesahc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#000000>(8/19/03 12:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsaulttribefrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   At-large board seats</span><hr size=1> I'm rather surprised Egoboy (actual name unknown) that someone who embraces Native American culture as passionately as you obviously do, chooses to frame that culture in such restrictive geographic terms.  In the Medicine Wheel, upon which Anishnabe culture is based, I see embodied spirituality and many aspects of nature but nothing that remotely suggests physical location as an important element of that culture.  Perhaps that is because the location and extent of present-day Sault tribal lands, indeed the lands of most native american tribes, have been dictated by a white settlers' government that selected and allotted them to suit their own needs and wishes.  You certainly do not have to go back to the days of Newfoundland or Nova Scotia habitation but only to the mid 19th century to see that the Anishnabe occupied a much larger area of the Great Lakes region than the Upper Peninsula service area which now encompasses only about 1600 acres.  <br>
<br>
But even if an argument can be made on cultural grounds for the return of members to the service area, tribal life is more than just culture, it is economics as well.  And economic conditions within the service area are not bright.  In 1999, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) reported a 71 percent unemployment rate among tribal members with 22 percent of those employed living below the poverty level.  Those statistics probably are not too surprising given that the economy of the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan is largely tourist-driven.   And the absence of a strong year-round economic base probably was what drove many Chippewa tribesmen away to the cities during the last 100 years in search of ways to support themselves and their families.  These brave people took with them the values and precepts of the Anishnabe and, if my family can be used as an example, passed them on to their offspring.  While these later generations have few if any ties to the artificially constructed seven-county service area, many do embrace the culture at least as strongly as some who live there.  And we do not &quot;play&quot; our identity, we live it through our strong connections with those caring persons who inculcated within us that identity and who have since walked on.  So in one respect you were absolutely correct; Anishnabe is a culture based on blood ties. Many of us also choose to mix with and interact with other tribes thereby learning of other native cultures and enhancing our own.   Here is an interesting question; what effect would there be on the Sault Tribe economy if the 20,000 plus members living &quot;below the bridge&quot; perceived a need to more closely embrace their culture and moved en masse to the service area?<br>
<br>
Like you, many who live outside the service area expect no financial or material rewards from the Tribe.  However, given the fact that now the Tribal economy is of a size that would be the envy of many small third-world countries, the outside voices demand to be heard.  This seems to be a reasonable expectation, if for no other reason than financial contributions to the Tribe by the U.S government are based on total membership size and not just on the number of members living in the service area. As it appears that those outside voices are largely ignored under the present organizational structure, it is entirely reasonable and appropriate to establish direct representation through at-large seats.<br>
<br>
Now Egoboy let me apologize, to you and to others who may read it, for the length of this communication.  And let me assure you that I am not trying to get you to agree with me; your previous communications make it obvious that such an accomplishment would be impossible given my limited powers of persuasion.  However, I do hope that others will read this interchange and make up their own minds.  With that I rest my case.<br>

<br>
 In addition to being a tribal member, I am also a citizen of the United States of America. The reason we fought for our independence from England was largely over &quot;Taxation without representation&quot;. I think that same feeling is going on now for our members living outside the 7 county service area.<br>
 If the tribe can count us for getting their federal dollars, then they can most certainly acknowledge us during election time with a fair percentage of seats on the board.<br>
 The prevailing sentiment amongst the at-large members is one of distrust of the current BOD and a lack of feeling represented on the BOD. I don't think that having to choose from a bunch of crony's in unit 1 offers me much hope for representation.<br>
 The at-large members hold a very powerful voting block if we are ever utilized correctly. I believe each prospective BOD candidate needs to state their views on this subject during the primaries. We need to know who is for fair and progressive government; or for the statu-quo, where 75% of the members have no true elected representation.<br>
 This is an idea whose time has come, if we are going to progress as a tribe.<br>
 Thanks for listening,<br>

Are you paying taxes to the Sault Tribe? Or do you mean that as a US citizen you should get back some of your federal taxes because our tribe recieves federal monies (just like all the cities, counties, states and territories do). All  tribal members  are required to be United States citizens in order to enroll. <br>
<br>
As for at-large representatives, how will I feel better represented by an individual who lives on the other side of the country, or even,( since so many of us are veterans and / or serving), outside the United States. I much prefer my elected representitive to be living within the largest concentration of my fellow tribal members, that would be unit one, where many eyes, ears and hands help them make the best decisions for the tribe as a whole. At least in unit one it is possible to authenticate who says what and are they even a tribal member.<br>
<br>
Is our tribe wealthy today? Yes, relative to how my father's generation fared. No, compared to some other tribes. Are we many in numbers? Yes, compared to some tribes here on the west coast that have fewer than 10 members. No, if you consider, &quot;Detroit's metropolitan area had a population of 5,456,400 in 2000. The metropolitan area also includes significant minority groups, including the largest community of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Arab Americans</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in the nation, numbering 102,000<br>
people in 2000.&quot; (source is &quot;Detroit (city, Michigan),&quot; Microsoft® Encarta® Online Encyclopedia 2003<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://encarta.msn.com">encarta.msn.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> © 1997-2003 Microsoft Corporation. All Rights Reserved.) Put another way, there are 3.4 Arab Americans living in Detroit alone, compared to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>all</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of our tribal members in the world (rounding our membership to 30,000).<br>
<br>
Now, more than ever, the admonition to, &quot;give only your very best advice, in counsel,&quot; applies. I live in Washington state, home to many tribes left relatively intact by history. The in-fighting and back biting in some tribes almost assures they will not survive. I mean to do all I can to insure my tribes survival as a flourishing and vibrant people. <br>

I was using it as the basis of what it was really intended for: The basic right of &quot;Actual Representation&quot; versus &quot;Virtual Representation&quot;.<br>
<br>
I realize that it would be ineffective government to have at-large BOD and expect them to govern/contribute from their current location. The at-large BOD would have to relocate temporarily to be able to conduct government business. That is one of basic foundations of citizen government. In today's mass transit society; I don't see the difference between living in Marquette and being on the BOD, or living in Iowa and being on the board...as long as I can be where I have to be, when I have to be.<br>
<br>
I don't put much faith in the analogy of: &quot;I much prefer my elected representitive to be living within the largest concentration of my fellow tribal members, that would be unit one, where many eyes, ears and hands help them make the best decisions for the tribe as a whole. At least in unit one it is possible to authenticate who says what and are they even a tribal member.&quot;<br>
<br>
So far the eyes and ears of unit one have been dubious at best, and thatis why we are in the shape we are in. It is in not having enough checks and balances in place. It is your right to be able to vote for someone in unit one. I have no problem with that. It is just that I also believe that I have the right to vote for whatever tribal member I think will do the best job (irregardless of where he lives).<br>
<br>
I also think it would be virtually impossible for a non-member to run, since you'll have to go to the Soo to register and fill out all sorts of forms (I would imagine). You'll have to show your tribal membership card at some point in the process, and that should really be the bottom line. <br>
<br>
These are tough times that our tribe and it's elected goverment are facing. Who knows all or some of the answers to our problems. That is a very good question. I for one think it's very bad business to eliminate the vast majority of our members from being able to assist our tribe, by not even being able to run for a seat on the BOD.<br>

Thanks for your reply. I thought I was the only one that felt the outside members were being ignored. Certainly traveling to the UP once or twice a month isn't a huge problem for me, coming from Lansing or any other city. Anyone aware of the 1836 treaty boundaries can see that almost 2/3's of the lower peninsula is within these boundaries. Why are the treaty boundaries not the service area?. A strong point should have been made when negotiations took place with the federal government many years ago. These boundaries should have never been deviated from in any negotiations since they are historic. The tax agreement should of had the same boundaries. I believe these boundaries would ultimately be upheld in Federal court since the 1836 treaty and all of its specifics have stood the test of time each time the courts have taken up legal opinions. Please respond with any opinions.<br>
