I have gone over the archives of this newsgroup, alt.2600, as well as the postings of several other newsgroups, from the very beginning to present-day. I'm fairly sure that I have gone over tens of thousands of postings, and examined the headers of thousands of those. I do not think that I have ever seen a more coordinated and ongoing attack on anyone's character, either on the web or in real life, than the character attacks that I have seen laid against Archangel and those who support him.<br>
<br>
As near as I can tell. These attacks (Flame Wars) on Archangel go back at least as far as 1986, and were just as invalid then as they are now. Phrack magazine mentions Archangel, and his group, The P.H.I.R.M., and makes comments about how there are rumors that the group was invested into by the feds, and rumors purporting Archangel to have used other nicks. These are the same kinds of nonsensical comments we see today. Taken as god's truth at the time, but no more valid then, than those wild accusations are today. Heavan forbid if a hacker should ever use multiple nicks. Now here is the part that is most difficult for me to write:<br>
<br>
Several years ago when I was using a different nick, I got an email from a person calling himself &quot;Balif&quot;. Now many of us know who Balif was, and what he was about, but I will get to that in a moment. At this time in my life I was a total newbie, and even though Balif had harvested my email from a post I made to alt.2600, I fell for his line. I fell hook, line, and sinker, and this is why. Balif was talking about destroying somebody that I absolutely could not stand. He was talking about destroying Archangel. Balif had formed a loose-knit group of people who were all working together, sharing research and theories, and tactics, all aimed at the destruction of one person, Archangel, and I was 100 percent in favor of it.<br>
<br>
At this point, I should mention a few things about Archangel for anyone who doesn't already know. (Sorry about this, Arch)<br>
<br>
Archangel is quite possibly the most obnoxious person that I have ever known. He may even be the most obnoxious person in the world. He is a braggert. Archangel is always willing to share his personal experience with you, especially if it is something that you are unlikely ever to do, and he will let you know it. He is arrogant. Archangel loves to see the look on someone's face when they realise that he owns something that they will never have, and he will dangle it in front of you, and continually remind you that he has something that you do not. He's the kind of guy who will say &quot;I told you so&quot; not once, but maybe a thousand times, until you feel like killing him. He enjoys pointing out the errors of others, and rubbing your nose in it when you are wrong. Not once, nor twice, nor sometimes, nor often, but in almost every case he will take this sort of thing too far. I believe that he sometimes enjoys watching a person's self-esteem crumble. He certainly seems to do everything in his power to make that happen when he has a chance. Archangel has a very SERIOUS personality flaw that causes people to want to kill him for real. There. Let it be known that I have said this, and that it is absolutely true. <br>
<br>
I hated Archangel. Even though he had done nothing to me, I hated him with every fibre of my being. When I was invited by Balif to join his informal little group, I jumped at it. One tactic that we enjoyed was to follow up every one of Archangel's posts with flames. If there were twenty of us, then he would get flamed twenty times for everything he posted, no matter how helpful. Another technique was to make up an outlandish lie, and support it with phoney &quot;evidence&quot; making it appear to be true. We could pull this sort of thing off, because we were somewhat coordinated, through Balif, while Archangel only had himself. If Archangel said that magnets could damage magnetic media, we would respond with long posts outlining complicated experiments we never did, just so we could say he didn't know what he was talking about. We would nitpick his spelling. I participated in this, knowing deep inside that what I was doing was wrong, but still doing it because everytime Archangel posted something, it was like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard. At times I even convinced myself that Archangel was as evil as we said. I participated in this, yes, even though Archangel had never done a single thing to me.<br>
<br>
The biggest single weapon that Balif ever used against Archangel was his website &quot;Archangel Debunked&quot; where he put the best of our stuff up for all to see. Put together in such a way that it appeared to make sense. Even appeared to have supporting evidence in the form of misquoted, Archangelisms, or even phonied up posts that we put up in Archangel's name. In the words of politics, it was &quot;Pure Spin&quot;, and Balif could spin like a DJ.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------<br>
On Balif's site, he claims that Archangel was &quot;a newbie in 1996&quot;<br>
His supporting documentation includes a well written timeline, starting in 1996,<br>
with links to dozens of postings which bear Archangel's name.<br>
<br>
Balif writes:<br>
&quot;But Archangel's claim that he's been a twenty year vet is ridiculous. I've talked with many people who have been on the internet for a dozen years. They are all an enormous wealth of knowledge. They know everything. And they haven't really changed over the time I've known them. I bet they haven't changed in the past few years either. Archangel on the other hand, appears as an obvious newbie, and you can plainly see how he advances. He comes from Netcom, which is one step above AOL in my book. Who is an experienced security/hacker person and doesn't use a small ISP with a *NIX shell account, or runs their own box? In his history, Archangel has shown to me that he is a constant liar, knows nothing about security or hacking or unix, and works very hard to build and maintain an image of the ideal person on alt.2600, an experienced &quot;old school&quot; hacker.&quot;<br>
<br>
That sounded pretty darn good back in those days. Although we knew about all the evidence supporting Archangel, we never mentioned it unless we were going to use it against him.<br>
<br>
We now know that Archangel was writing texts as early as 1981. It is not a stretch to assume that Archangel is telling the truth when he says he got into computers in 1977. This whole section of Balif's site, all the &quot;evidence&quot;, all the Garstecki stuff, everything, is based on a lie. The lie that Archangel was a newbie in 1997. ...Hardly, Archangel was a 20-year vet by then.<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
On Balif's site, he claims that Archangel is unfamiliar with hacker history.<br>
He writes:<br>
&quot;Read the Hacker Crackdown, it is perhaps one of the better (or maybe the best hacker) subculture text/book out there. There's no guessing or sensantionalizing, only facts from the people who where involved in history. Then compare it to Archangel's story. He has no clue what he's talking about.&quot;<br>
<br>
This section of Balif's site, with all it's so-called evidence, is also based on a total lie. Anyone reading &quot;The Hacker Crackdown&quot; will find a mention of Archangel's Group!!!<br>
We now know that Archangel knows his history, in fact he was part of it.<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Balif claimed that &quot;Archangel posts existing texts and claimed he wrote it&quot;<br>
To put this in perspective. Archangel is an unashamed plagiarist. Archangel even has it as one of his virtues in his 12 codes. Balif talks like this is a bad thing, as if no hacker ever downloaded info that didn't belong to him. In my mind, this goes so far into the realm of the surreal that it should hardly be mentioned. It's like saying that an eagle is not a real bird because it flies so well. But Balif made it sound good. And we all got up on our white horses and applauded ourselves because we didn't do that sort of thing... Balif personally showed me how to post up an idiotic message, and make it look like Archangel did it. Something I did many times. Someone else showed me how to cancel Archangel's posts, though I never took it that far, I'm sure some people did. This part of Balif's site is based on a lie, just like the others. The lie that hackers do not break moral and legal codes.<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Balif's site even claimed that Archangel's photos were phony.<br>
Balif wrote:<br>
&quot;Archangel has a selection of pictures on his page that he said were from &quot;Angelfests&quot;, where members of his elite club of hackers would gather and throw parties. These pictures where questioned from the very beginning, because one that he claimed was of &quot;Devil's Night&quot; looked more like a college classroom than a room in Archangel's house, as he described it. One day some german guy posted making fun of Archangel and pointing out that the pictures where lifted from several sites in Germany. Archangel tried to say he went to Germany frequently and this only strenghtened his arguments.&quot;<br>
<br>
We all knew that the photos were authentic. Somebody, not Balif, but another Darkridge guy, posted up a note in very bad German, this claim about the pictures. Balif had people believing that &quot;Some German Guy&quot; (mysterious, eh?), saw the pictures on Archangel's site, and rather than complain to Archangel, instead posted up a badly translated piece to alt.2600 admonishing Archangel. Well that was years ago. And we now know that this too, was pure BS, because we were there when Balif came up with the dumb idea. We also knew that the devil's night photos were authentic, and not from some classroom, as RED-DOG beer cans are clearly seen strewn throughout Archangel's livingroom. ('NUFF SAID! )<br>
Again, this whole section of Balif's site is based on a lie.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Balif claimed that Arch knew nothing about unix.<br>
On Archangel's UNIX primers, Balif wrote:<br>
&quot;They took the form of stolen man pages. All where horrible and useless, targeting newbies yet covering commands like ntroff. Under his explanation of Sed, he identified it as a stream editor and listed two useless command line switches for using scripts. It was discovered that his listing and most of his primers were directly stolen from O'reily's &quot;Unix in a Nutshell&quot; book. When confronted, Archangel said he had no problems taking text from the book, and complained he would not give a bibliography for each post he made. There are so many of these posts, I'm not going to make an attempt to archive them.&quot;<br>
<br>
All in one breath, he accuses Archangel of pasting stolen man-pages, then claiming the facts are wrong and incorrect, finally saying they come from a well-known, published book! It can't be all three, obviously, but if you read Balif's prose above, it seems to make sense on the surface. Then he jumps back to the plagiarism thing again, which we covered a few paragraphs ago. This is exactly the sort of thing Balif was good at. Never once did he mention on his site how many people Archangel helped with those hundreds of posts. So many posts in fact, that Balif could not archive them. Archangel says he drew from three books with those primers, nearly reprinting the entire contents of all three books. He helped a hellava lot of people.<br>
This section of Balif's site is as useless as the rest.<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Balif writes:<br>
&quot;Phrack Magazine is perhaps one of the most well known, oldest electronic magazines. There are many others that are greats, but this is probably the most well known. It has had writers since 1985, starting on the Metal Shop BBS at 1200/2400 baud. If you read this magazine, you will see big names, many people who invented or where the first to publish new way's to break into systems or exploit the phone system. If you are going to say anything is &quot;old school&quot;, Phrack is very old school. Having said that, the magazine has sort of gone to shit as of late because of a changing scene and a changing of hands. But it's been around since the beginning. A lot of the writers where members of the original 2600 club.&quot;<br>
<br>
Knowing what we do of Archangel now (Even though we hid these facts then) this should make just about anyone fall out of thier chair, considering PHRACK did a writup on Archangel and his  group, The P.H.I.R.M.  We knew it at the time, but we didn't tell anybody.<br>
<br>
This section of Balif's site is based on a lie of omission.<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Balif goes into great detail about Archangel's book, CIA Hacker.<br>
He goes through page after page of so-called contradictions in things Archangel says about his book, so-called lies about the book, Archangel's spelling, and Archangel's lack of knowlege of writing. He goes on and on and on. Balif was very convincing.<br>
<br>
This &quot;debunking&quot; of Archangel's book was a major theme with Balif, as it was clear that Arch was having trouble getting it published, etc.<br>
<br>
Now today, Archangel's book, CIA Hacker, is for sale on his website.<br>
It was all based on a lie, like everything else, but people believed us anyway.<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Finally, the number #1 theme is the supposed &quot;fact&quot; that Archangel is a person named<br>
Dan Garstecki. This is one of the more interesting aspects, because I never quite understood,<br>
even while I was attacking Archangel, why it was so important to &quot;Prove&quot; that he was this Dan Garstecki guy. It made no sense. It still doesn't. Yet even to this day, I see people following up Archangel's posts with garstecki stuff. I now know why. I suppose it's a powerful distraction from whatever Archangel is posting at that moment, but it has more to do with Garstecki's divorce. Simply put, Balif and a few others are in the service of Garstecki's ex-inlaws. I believe Archangel when he says this, because it's the only way the garstecki stuff makes any sense. Nobody would ever give a shit otherwise.<br>
<br>
Balif started this one right here:<br>
<br>
Balif writes:<br>
&quot;* 7-07-96 is the first post I can find, to alt.bio.hackers. The post looks like it's written by a newbie. Note the signature: <br>
Duff Garstecki<br>
(The original Archangel, before hacking became so uncool)<br>
This is the first post made, where Garstecki names himself as Archangel. This has never been brought up in alt.2600, and Archangel has never mentioned it. &quot;Before hacking became so uncool&quot;, from the very beginning he says he has years of experience. &quot;<br>
<br>
There are so many things wrong with this post that it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, the writer isn't &quot;Dan&quot; Garstecki, it is &quot;Duff&quot; Garstecki. If it is not even the right guy, what the heck is all the hubub about??? Second, this particular account was a U.S. Congressional Campaign account owned by Dan Garstecki, who was running for U.S. Congress at the time. Balif wanted us to believe that a congressional candidate took time off his busy schedule to post to a hacking group confessing to be a hacker????<br>
<br>
Archangel has told us that he was working on Garstecki's website at that time, and that particular account was one of several with multiple users, as many as thirty. It is more likely that a disgruntled campaign worker made the post. Archangel says that he did use that account to post to newsgroups, but not that particular post. <br>
<br>
It is HIGHLY UNLIKELY that a congressional candidate decided to post confessions to hacker groups at the height of his campaign. More likeley the post was made by one of Dan Garstecki's bitter inlaws, who took advantage of the computer access, hoping to hurt Garstecki during a messy divorce.<br>
<br>
There is no Duff Garstecki. The person does not exist.<br>
Like everything else on the site. Balif's so-called facts turn out to be outright lies.<br>
Archangel even posted while garstecki was in jail.<br>
How much Garstecki BS have you seen over the years??? <br>
...and its all based on T-H-I-S???<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I used to support Balif, but it was only because Archangel irritated me.<br>
When I ran into Archangel during DefCon, and found out what a cool person he is, it sent me into a spiral, because it was as if a small piece of my reality had been turned completely upside down. Archangel has lent me help, labor, money, etc., without ever asking for anything in return. He is NOT Dan Garstecki, and doesn't even look remotely like him. There are people in this newsgroup who have photos of Archangel, and know his real name and phone number, and it is just shocking to think that there are still Balif followers. I woke up and saw the light.<br>
<br>
Balif lied and manipulated everything in his site. There is no debunking, just a bunch of crap that we now know is false. Archangel's length of experience, his knowlege of hacker history, his Book CIA Hacker, even the photos on his site, all &quot;debunked&quot; by Balif, but we now know that Archangel was telling the truth the entire time. When you add in the fact that Balif tried to trick this entire newsgroup by lying outright to Desperado and Harlequin, it is truly surprising that anyone holds any credibility to the guy at all.<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Balif, and some others who are still here, are still posting up the lies. We might believe some of them today, but they will be exposed tomorrow. Just as the lies of yesterday are exposed today. Use your heads and your own knowledge. Don't make the mistake that I made, and begin repeating lies about somebody who has never done anything to you. You may end up having to pay for it later.

He is the kind of person who will make up any kind of a lie about somebody in order to acheive his ends. He has bragged about getting an innocent person investigated for murder. He is as low as low gets.<br>
<br>
He came after me, and I put him down. he's an expert, and I BARELY did it, but I caught him in a lie that he couldn't squirm out of, and survived, unlike most of his victims.<br>
<br>
Balif makes money by destroying the lives of people like you and me. I think this thread does a pretty good job exposing balif's lies, and I'll rest on that.<br>

I guess I should come clean though, before you figure me out and check into a hotel room and use keylowin to hack me...I am a private investigator hired by certain inlaws of a certain person whom you are well acquainted with...does Garstecki ring a bell?

<br>
I guess it must feel pretty good to be able to delete stuff like this, maybe you can say I put &quot;porn&quot; on this post, or &quot;spam&quot;. Too bad you can't delete posts like that on alt.2600 every time someone reveals your lies. Of course, you can sock up quite nicely on your own little bulletin board to defend yourself and even make it seem like you actually have friends! I mean you do the same thing in alt.2600, only I'd say 100% of the regs there know your M.O. and anyone who takes 30 mins to read the google archives can figure out quite easily you are a fraud!<br>

I don't see Archangel lying about anything. All I see is YOU trying to convince people that you are a private investigator, trying to start more rumors like the ones debunked in the very first post in this thread. Maybe you better read it.<br>
<br>
It sounds like these stupid posts may be more readily accepted elsewhere, little pwot. Take your off-topic flames and shit away from here. We are not interested. Your posts will continuously be deleted as long do not follow the rules.<br>
Period.<br>
