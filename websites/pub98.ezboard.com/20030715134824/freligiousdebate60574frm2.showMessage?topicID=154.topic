BTW, I saw your post about your mosque being attacked.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Our synagogue was vandalized by a white supremacist group when I was a kid, but that was at least done at night when nobody was there.  They did come back around, and they got into it with the JDL, but I don't remember all the details behind it.  I just can't get over some people.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yeah, it's a drag about the mosque.. my inclination is to think it was some kids from the highschool that's next door, it's happened before.. I don't know that there's as much inter-meeting between the groups as there could be to make people more comfy with each other.<br>
<br>
I also hope the mosque folks don't blow it too out of proportion, if it does end up being kids.. I mean, it's wrong and they should have to both reimburse and hopefully go through some kind of sensitivity training, but as a community we tend to have this &quot;they're all out to get us!&quot; mentality these days.  Last night after the prayer they were asking for volunteers to monitor the grounds, etc.  Personally, I'd rather push the local police to do that (they already were last night), and make sure security cameras are installed.<br>

The paper depicted it as a hate crime, but later I found out it was some kids from school who just thought he was a geek, and they weren't really prejudice against Jews.  Sometimes kids are just looking for trouble.  In a way I hope that is all it is.  Stupid kids are a lot less dangerous than hateful people.<br>

Well, I read her response.. and in all honesty, I don't blame her for feeling that way, but it only cements the hopelessness I feel at the situation.  She says that all Israelis feel the same way, and while I don't believe that most Palestinians would kill her children, I do believe that the majority is anti-Jew.  The worst thing is that both sides say they can never trust the other side.. well how in the world are you supposed to come to any kind of resolution then?!<br>

I'm kidding of course.  I'm glad you saw her response to the question.  I can understand her frustration as well, but I wanted to make sure she wasn't the type of person who would see an innocent Arab child walking down the street and wish bad things to happen to him.  I was waiting on responding to her until I heard from you. That way if you had more questions or concerns I could bring them to her without starting a gajillion posts on the subject.  I honestly do feel for her, and I'll tell her that.  I agree with you, trying to figure out a solution to this mess can give you a big fat headache.  That is the part you and I will never have to debate on.<br>

I mean, I know Palestinians there, so I hear what they're saying, and I read the media here and overseas, the only people I haven't heard from is people on the &quot;other side&quot; who live there.  Although, that said, I guess I just wouldn't know where to begin.  I wish there were some Israeli ladies who would just pop into Chicago and agree to sit and have tea with me, lol... I just can't get much of a feel for how people are really feeling through a computer, you know?<br>
<br>
The thing is, for every horrible thing that has happened on one side, the other side can complain of the same thing.  She keeps saying how the terrorists have targeted women and children, well the Israeli army isn't exactly squeaky clean in that area either.. I mean, they live in fear to go outside, the other side lives in a cess-pool refugee camp.. both are terrible places to try and raise children, and it's difficult to offer them any kind of hope for change.<br>
<br>
What really concerns me, and this came up today when an associate was visiting me to get some homeschooling advice, the indoctrination that goes on with the kids.. every male Arab child I have known is into guns, all kinds.. personally I can't deal with my son playing with toy guns, or using toys as pretend guns.. but even the Arab in-laws of a friend of mine went for Hajj -- religious event of a lifetime, right? -- and the gift they bring back for her sons, you guessed it, toy guns.. I mean, I guess I don't understand since I've never lived under those conditions, but I know that my own parents always tried to raise me to rise above whatever hangups they had.  I don't *know*, but I would guess that at least your poster is not raising her kids to be kindly towards Arabs.<br>

It's not a pretty picture.<br>

She is fairly new, and I don't know her that well.  I've known Israelis in the past, but at the time I kind of had my head in the sand on the issue, so I didn't think to ask more questions.

That is interesting what you said about all the toy guns.  I remember you mentioning something similar to this before.  Is that an issue being addressed during talks on the modernization of Islam?  I know everyone has a different opinion on toy guns, but I would guess that the bigger concern lies with the overall perception of violence among Muslim children.  Some of the Israeli/Jewish stuff I buy for my son tries to promote peace with Arabs, but it is hard to say how common or realistic that it among actual Israelis.  His things make Arabs and Jews within Israel out to be friends.  Then again, children's items here in America don't exactly point out problems between the races and religions.  I do know that pushing violence through children's toys and media is rare in Western culture nowadays, so maybe the Eastern culture just needs some catch up.  <br>

There's a big gap.  In the states, there's a big effort to be multicultural, born of (I imagine) living in a pluralist society.  People don't talk much about kids overseas.. and it's really taboo to criticize the Palestinian people on any level.  I mean, I was talking with this lady today, who's American married to an Arab, and I expressed my concern about the violence these kids are emulating, but she gave me a look like &quot;Well, we don't live under occupation, so we shouldn't say anything&quot;.  That kind of stuff.  I know I'm viewed as a maverick on the whole toy guns issue, even among some of my American friends.  <br>
<br>
My son fell once when he was, like, an early 4, and started crying, and this older lady from overseas started telling him to stop crying, be a man, boys don't cry, etc.  I was almost moved to commit a little violence myself, lol!<br>
<br>
Guns just weren't something my parents ever encouraged or even hinted at with us.  There was just no physicality of any kind -- no spanking, no school fights, I can't imagine my parents ever even shouting, it just never happened.  Someone bought my bro a BB gun when he was, like, 12, and my parents were less than thrilled (even more so when he shot out the kitchen window, lol).  But I've found in general (warning: sweeping prejudiced generalization coming) many cultures in the 3rd world are not as keyed into intense interaction with kids on the level we in the west are... and I know they don't have much concern for mental health or mental issues.. the idea of post partum depression, or post traumatic stress disorder, or anything like that, is a totally foreign concept.  <br>
<br>
It's funny, I've lived in the Middle East and I've lived here (obviously), and I've noticed that in the US we're very concerned about kids being exposed to violence but not so much about being exposed to sexual innuendo, etc; whereas in the Middle East they are very concerned about kids being exposed to sexual innuendo, but not so much about violence.  <br>
<br>
Just an observation.<br>

<br>
You must be reading my mind.  I was just thinking about this the other day, and I was tempted to mention it in one of our discussions.  If I had to choose between the two, then I would take the sexual innuendo hands down.  But then again, I was raised in this culture.  Have you run into very many people in the Middle East, or even Muslims here in the US, who feel like you do about the violence portrayed to children?  It sounds like the majority feel differently than you, but if there were at least a significant number within the minority, then that could start the Islamic culture down the path of change.  I guess I just never felt that viewing cleavage could hurt a child quite the same way holding a gun can.  OTOH, I'm sure they can argue that our openness about sexuality helps contribute to the spread of disease and unwanted children.<br>
<br>
My mom was the same way about toy guns.  She was pretty liberal on most things, but she refused to let me play with toy guns.  My stepdad and I would watch horror movies galore, but the guns were a no no.  I guess I'm not to keen on the idea of toy guns either.  Watching someone shoot a gun on tv sort of seperates you from the violence, but actually holding the gun may desensitize a child because they are participating in the act.  Wait, did that make sense?  LOL.  <br>
<br>
Do you mind me asking where in the Middle East you lived?  It sounds like you've been to so many interesting places, and I was wondering the background on that.  I've been around the US a lot, and I've been to Canada, Mexico and Jamaica, but that doesn't necessarily make me wordly, lol.  I suppose that all your travel or living overseas exposed you to the beauty of Islam, whereas people in America only really see the downside of Islam.  It isn't too often that I hear about people converting to Islam, but then again, my stepmom is the only person I know who converted to Judaism.  I hope I'm not prying, I just find it interesting.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I haven't really run into any people in the Middle East who talk about it much.. although I've heard there is some progress being made in the area of mental health over there, but I don't know that will translate to trying to minimize the violence children are exposed to.  Here in the US it's a bigger issue in society overall, I've talked to several people about it, although it's not a universal concern.<br>
<br>
&quot;Watching someone shoot a gun on tv sort of seperates you from the violence, but actually holding the gun may desensitize a child because they are participating in the act. Wait, did that make sense? LOL. &quot;<br>
<br>
They had a program on 60 Minutes (or was it Dateline?  same thing, lol..) where they put a group of children alone in a room with an unloaded gun placed on a shelf.  They wanted to see how the children reacted to the presence of the gun.  I thought it was interesting that first, none of the girls wanted anything to do with it.  Second there were a couple boys who looked scared, and then there were a couple who picked it up and started to play with it.  The overriding comment was how none of the children tried to leave and get an adult.<br>

Well my training is as a linguist, so I lived in Austria for a while to work on German, and traveled around Europe and into Hungary (a communist Hungary - dating myself here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) while I was there.. then I started studying Arabic, and moved to Egypt for a while to work on that, and traveled to Jordan and Israel while I was there.  After I got married we started visiting the in-laws <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (lol, actually I really like them) who are centered in Saudi Arabia, but he also has relatives in UAE and India, so I've spent time there too.. and we've managed to visit Turkey and Greece, although now it's difficult to do much &quot;vacationing&quot; because whenever you get a chunk of free time and enough money to do that, you're kind of bound to visit your family, and not go galavanting off, lol.<br>
<br>
We're planning to visit Saudi in the summer.  My sil just got married there (arranged marriage -- you guys will love that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and are waiting for us to have more celebrations <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Locally I haven't really travelled as much.. I've been to Canada, and Arizona, and used to have an aunt in Colorado, but other than occasional visits to the east coast I generally stay right here in the midwest.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose that all your travel or living overseas exposed you to the beauty of Islam, whereas people in America only really see the downside of Islam.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not really, lol.  I mean I guess it was a factor.  Actually I started reading about Islam as a side note to my Arabic studies.  I really knew next to no Muslims before I decided to convert (maybe that was a good thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).. seriously, though, I spent, like, two years reading Islamic texts and when I moved to Egypt I was pretty much already in the frame of mind to convert.. however, the Egyptian people are (were? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  it's been almost 11 years) amazing, and I'm sure that must have had some positive effect as well.<br>
<br>
I guess that's part of what is frustrating for me when I talk about Islam with people, is that they are basing their knowledge on their experience of Muslim people, and I am basing mine on the texts I've read.  So when I give a lecture, I tend to start with &quot;forget about what you see in Muslim-majority countries...&quot; lol<br>
<br>
&quot;It isn't too often that I hear about people converting to Islam, but then again, my stepmom is the only person I know who converted to Judaism.&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't think you could really convert to Judaism?  Or is that only with certain subgroups?  I had always thought of Jewish as an ethnic label as much as a religious one.. although having said that, one of the books I'm reading now is &quot;Fragile Branches: Travels though the Jewish Diaspora&quot; by James Ross.. it's talking about six Jewish communities in unusual places in the world, some have chosen to become Jewish en masse and some have Jewish ancestry.. hmm, I already have a lot of questions, but I'll save them until I finish the book <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

<br>
It really depends. Orthodox sects don't really recognize converts because they feel that there are several &quot;paths to God&quot;, and that you can follow the commandments regardless of whether you are Christian or Muslim.  Most of my family is Reform, and Reform recognizes converts.  Every sect, group and culture is different within Judaism, so it really varies.  A lot of Jews feel that you are Jewish if you are joined through either blood lines or spiritually, and a convert would fall under the spiritual category.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I had always thought of Jewish as an ethnic label as much as a religious one...&quot;<br>
<br>
This is why I say that the definition of a Jew is very confusing.  Everytime I pick up a book about Jews in general, there is a little debate/commentary in the beginning about what defines a Jew.  The authors usually argue that being Jewish isn't part of being with a religion because of the fact that Jews have different religious beliefs and practices, from the ultra Orthodox to the secular Atheist.  They will also argue that we aren't part of a race or ethnic group because of the fact that Jews come in all colors and ethnic backgrounds.  They will usually use the black Ethiopian Jews as an example, and mention how Israel did a rescue operation to get them out of the conditions in their home country.  I'll sometimes refer to it as a culture, but then that isn't technically accurate because all Jews come from different cultural backgrounds with different practices.  The Sephardic and Ashekenazi are two prime examples of that.  <br>
<br>
I had no idea that you have been to Israel.  Did you interact much with the Jewish community, or mostly the Arab?  I didn't know if you maybe had some experiences there that sort of cemented your opinion about Jewish-Israelis and the situation over there.  My sister went there a few years ago with her Hillel group from her university, and my grandfather went there on his honeymoon when he got remarried about 20 years ago.  I haven't been there yet myself.  I'm going to wait until things settle down over there (if they settle down).  The next trip will be talking my dh into going.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   He's not Jewish, and he has no interest in ever going to that area of the world.  You should have seen the whining he did when he had to wear a yarmulke at a synagogue once.  Then he kept laughing at how my grandpa looked like Flounder from Animal House in his beanie.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Well, I have been to Colorado.  I live here.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I haven't read the book you are talking about, but if you have questions for me when you are done, then fire away.  I've sure picked your brain enough.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
It was more from the Arab side.. I was with Arab friends, we went as a small group (three of us), travelled through the Sinai to get in.  At the border, the security folks asked where we were planning to go in Israel, and completely naive I said &quot;West Jerusalem&quot;.. well, it was time for me to pull up a chair because I sat at the border for, and I'm not exaggerating, five hours.  They went through every iota of every thing I was carrying.. checked all the seams in every article of clothing, got out little chemistry kits to check any substances in my &quot;toilet&quot;, took me in a back room and searched through my hair, it went on and on.. all the time they have the largish guys standing around with the x-ray glasses (of course, not the nerdy ones you see in older movies, the cool ones that look almost like Ray-bans, lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).. that said, they were curtly polite, no one was rude, it was like they were just doing their job.<br>
<br>
Inside Israel I was more interested in historical sites, Christian, Jewish and Muslim.  I had to lie to get into the mosque compound (I wasn't &quot;officially&quot; Muslim yet), as they were only allowing Muslims inside.. which thinking back is interesting, because it meant, at least how I look at it, they were trying to keep the peace and prevent clashes... I don't know if they'd had people try to get in there and cause trouble or what.  So I basically did the whole &quot;traditional&quot; tour - Via Dolorosa, Mount of Olives, Wailing Wall, Gate of David, Bethlehem, etc. etc... we did go through Eilat, which I didn't like so much (a typical beach resort), and visited some of the newer parts of Jerusalem, but my interest wasn't there.. I like the old parts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We did a small amount of driving around (bus and taxi), so saw the Dead Sea, bought some salty mud facial stuff to bring home, that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
What I did notice was an overall atmosphere of tension.  I didn't see any scuffles myself, but there was just this feeling, I don't know how to describe it, a vibe or something.  I'm sure it must be worse now.  There was a quietness, although obviously there were the noises of day-to-day living, I'm not sure I'm describing it right.  It reminded me, in a way, of when I visited communist Hungary.  There too was a sort of oppressive atmosphere.  You didn't see people walking around laughing, joking.. the joys of life were not evident.. <br>
<br>
I guess overall my comment would be that it's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.  I think that's something we as Americans really have only just begun to feel.  I mean, people used to tell me they could tell I was American just by the way I would walk.. you know, we tend to have a kind of bouncy, excited, alive, urgent way we walk around.. I can see it now that someone has pointed it out to me.. and you can see that it's different from other people.. I don't know, maybe I'm totally flaking out, but I feel that since it's been so long since we've lived under any kind of oppression, whether overt or covert, we still have that kind of optimism, and it reflects in our society and even in the way we are.<br>
<br>
Am I totally weird, lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ?<br>

No, you aren't weird.  You are just observant.  Part of your observation may have been due to the fact that you were constantly cognizant of the problems over there, and part of it may have been an accurate observation.  It is easy to take for granted what we have here in this country, and whenever something bad happens, it is reflected in the mannerisms of society.  When we moved to Colorado, my dh noticed the difference in traffic patterns the day after the Broncos played a game.  No joke.  Traffic was always worse the day after they lost.  When they were in the Superbowl, there was a state of elation in the area, and it was almost like a holiday.  If people can act so different over something as trivial as football, then political strife would really make a huge difference.  <br>
