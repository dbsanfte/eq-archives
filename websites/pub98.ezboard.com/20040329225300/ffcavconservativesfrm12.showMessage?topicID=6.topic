<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He spent less than 90 days in Viet Nam, but he claims to have sufficient military experience to become our Commander - in - Chief. He might have a rightful claim - if he had learned the right things.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Here's what he learned.<br>
I would like to say for the record ... I am not here as John Kerry. I am here as one member of the group of one thousand, which is a small representation of a very much larger group of veterans in this country, and were it possible for all of them to sit at this table they would be here and have the same kind of testimony. <br>
* * *<br>
... we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged and many very highly decorated veterans testified to war crimes committed in Southeast Asia, not isolated incidents but crimes committed on a day-to-day basis with the full awareness of officers at all levels of command. <br>
... [T]hey relived the absolute horror of what this country, in a sense, made them do. <br>
... [T]hey had personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in fashion reminiscent of Genghis Khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war, and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country. <br>
* * * <br>
The country doesn't know it yet but it has created a monster, a monster in the form of millions of men who have been taught to deal and to trade in violence, and who are given the chance to die for the biggest nothing in history ... <br>
* * * <br>
[W]e in no way consider ourselves the best men of this country, because those he {Vice President Agnew} calls misfits were standing up for us in a way that nobody else in this country dared to, because so many who have died would have returned to this country to join the misfits in their efforts to ask for an immediate withdrawal from South Vietnam ... we cannot consider ourselves America's best men when we are ashamed of and hated what we were called to do in Southeast Asia.<br>
... And to attempt to justify the loss of one American life in Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos by linking such loss to the preservation of freedom, which those misfits supposedly abuse, is to us the height of criminal hypocrisy, and it is that kind of hypocrisy which we feel has torn this country apart.<br>
We are probably much more angry than that, and I don't want to go into the foreign policy aspects because I am outclassed here. I know that all of you talk about every possible alternative for getting out of Vietnam. We understand that. We know you have considered the seriousness of the aspects to the utmost level, and I am not going to try to dwell on that. But I want to relate to you the feeling that many of the men who have returned to this country express because we are probably angriest about all that we were told about Vietnam and about the mystical war against Communism. <br>
We found that not only was it a civil war, an effort by a people who had for years been seeking their liberation from any colonial influence whatsoever, but also we found that the Vietnamese, whom we had enthusiastically molded after our own image, were hard put to take up the fight against the threat we were supposedly saving them from. <br>
We found most people didn't even know the difference between Communism and democracy ... [T]hey practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.<br>
... Blacks provided the highest percentage of casualties ...<br>
We saw America lose her sense of morality as she accepted very coolly a My Lai ... <br>
* * *<br>
Each day, to facilitate the process by which the United States washes her hands of Vietnam, someone has to give up his life so that the United States doesn't have to admit something that the entire world already knows, so that we can't say that we have made a mistake. Someone has to die so that President Nixon won't be, and these are his words, &quot;the first President to lose a war.&quot; <br>
We are asking Americans to think about that because how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?<br>
If you read carefully the President's last speech to the people of this country, you can see that he says and says clearly: &quot;But the issue, gentlemen, the issue, is Communism, and the question is whether or not we will leave that country to the Communists or whether or not we will try to give it hope to be a free people.&quot; But the point is they are not a free people now under us, they are not a free people and we cannot fight Communism all over the world, and I think we should have learned that lesson by now. <br>
But the problem with veterans goes beyond this personal problem, because you think about a poster in this country with a picture of Uncle Sam and the picture says: I WANT YOU. And a young man comes out of high school and says: &quot;That is fine, I am going to serve my country&quot; ... and when he gets back to this country he finds that he isn't really wanted because the largest unemployment figure in this country ... are veterans of this war, and of those veterans 33 per cent of the unemployed are black. That means one out of every ten of the nation's unemployed is a veteran of Vietnam. <br>
* * *<br>
Fifty-seven per cent, I understand 57 per cent of all those entering the V.A. hospitals talk about suicide. Some 27 per cent have tried, and they try because they come back to this country and they have to face what they did in Vietnam ...<br>
* * *<br>
[W]e are rationalizing leaving that country so that those people can go on killing each other for years to come.<br>
* * *<br>
We have come here {Congress}, not to the President, because we believe that this body can be responsive to the will of the people, and we believe that the will of the people says that we should be out of Vietnam now.<br>
... [T]he problem of this war is not just a question of war and diplomacy. It is part and parcel of everything that we are trying as human beings to communicate to people in this country: the question of racism, which is rampant in the military, and so many other questions; also, the use of weapons, the hypocrisy in our taking umbrage in the Geneva Conventions and using that as justification for a continuation of this war, when we are more guilty than any other body of violations of those Geneva Conventions, in the use of free-fire zones, harassment, interdiction fire, search-and-destroy missions, the bombings, the torture of prisoners, the killing of prisoners - accepted policy by many units in South Vietnam. That is what we are trying to say. It is part and parcel of everything. <br>
* * *<br>
... Where are the leaders of our country, where is the leadership? We are here to ask McNamara, Rostow, Bundy, Gilpatric and so many others, where are they now that we, the men whom they sent off to war, have returned? These are commanders who have deserted their troops, and there is no more serious crime in the law of war. <br>
* * *<br>
Finally, this administration has done us the ultimate dishonor. They have attempted to disown us and the sacrifices we made for this country ... <br>
We wish that a merciful God could wipe away our own memories of that service as easily as this administration has wiped their memories of us. But all that they have done and all that they can do by this denial is to make more clear than ever our own determination to undertake one last mission, to search out and destroy the last vestige of this barbaric war ... [so] ... we will be able to say &quot;Vietnam&quot; and not mean a desert, not a filthy obscene memory, but mean instead the place where America finally turned ... <br>
