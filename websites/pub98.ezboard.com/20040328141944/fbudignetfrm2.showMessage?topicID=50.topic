In Memory of Jaci Budig-Hartle<br>
<br>
<br>
In the weeks just prior to her death, Jaci and I came to love reciting Psalms 23, please join with me…The Lord is my Shepard, I shall not want…………<br>
<br>
We grieve the loss of a family member or friend most of the time with the knowledge and the peacefulness that death has come as a blessing.  This blessing is from knowing a spirit is free from the trappings of an old and tired body and with the comfort in knowing a life full of memories has been fulfilled.  More difficult is when we grieve the loss of a life for one whose time we as human beings feel should not have come so soon and whose memories were still being written.  While we share our grief in the loss of Jaci, we can also share always the joy and beauty of her life.  While her death was a blessing from the ravages of cancer, we can be comforted that her life was truly a gift from God.  A gift each one of us can be comforted by that will remain with us forever.  A gift that will endure and allow us to better understand the importance of God’s love and grace even in very sad days.  Seize this moment for it is good.    <br>
<br>
During the five months of her care, a window to the beauty of this gift opened before my eyes and Jaci’s also.  Over the last few months of her life we were not able to get Jaci up the stairs so her care and life was based on a hospital type bed in the living room of our home.  The location of her bed allowed a floor to ceiling view out the living room windows to take in the beauty of a new spring coming into bloom.  Our favorite view from these windows was the almost daily visit of a cardinal who perched on the closest of branches perched to sing a song directly at Jaci as if told to do so.  We were also able to see this beauty in our many walks down the path where we saw deer and beauty around each corner.   But it is from this living room we shared many thoughts.  Perhaps that we had the time over these five months to really share in our hopes, dreams and misgivings was what allowed us this view, silently away from the hustle and bustle of jobs and raising Sam and Heidi.  The closeness of sharing with each other our love by the simple counting to three as we timed the rising from her bed in perfect harmony, our hearts beating against each other and breathing so close to each other you can taste it.    Seize the moment for it is good.  <br>
<br>
Being witness to the amazing strength and care both Sam and Heidi gave to Jaci and I during these five months.  Knowing now from this care, that Jaci’s years of sacrifice, patience and nurturing as a mother has paid off.  Jaci’s love and devotion to Sam and Heidi was immeasurable as is the love I was witness to of Donna’s love for Jaci and all of her children.  So much can be said from just a scrap-book memory poem Heidi wrote to Jaci many years ago to enrich this understanding of God’s and a mother’s love…<br>
<br>
Mothers are for loving you &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
If you’re good or bad<br>
Mothers are for sharing<br>
Whatever makes you glad<br>
<br>
Mothers are for loving<br>
When you snuggle up so tight<br>
Mothers are for kissing you<br>
A sweet and kind good night<br>
<br>
Seize the moment for it is good.<br>
<br>
Each day many people blessed us and in so many ways.  The care Jaci and our family received during these past five months was staggering.   The meals, e-mails, cards, letters, artwork, singing, plants, flowers, patience and understanding from so many people from our places of work, from old and new neighborhoods, from the members of the Grace Covenant Presbyterian Church we attend, to both families, and all of our friends in Owatonna, St. Charles, Atlanta, and in Kansas City.   Jaci’s life allowed so many people to express their care in so many ways.  Jaci’s brother Kevin; setting up the Forum where friends and families could send prayers and then driving to Kansas City with his wife Kathy and two sons, Nate and Nik to visit during their Spring Break.   Jaci’s sister Sue who was fortunate to be able to take a few days away from her and Tom’s bustling household to sing songs by Jaci’s bedside.  The blessing to have Jaci’s sister Michelle spend extended time with us twice, sharing walks and care giving and all the different bean dishes she provided, and the precious moments with Jaci on a level that only sisters can touch.  To have the beautiful mixture of compassion and laughter provided by Michelle’s husband, Peter during his visit.  A brief but so very special visit with Dean and Marsha who thankfully returned Heidi back from her visit to Owatonna.  And the very special Thanksgiving we shared here in Kansas City with my sister Leslea’s family when so little was still understood about the battle that lay ahead.  The gift of having friends back in Owatonna that gave Heidi a Spring Break to remember.  There are so many people, so many people who cared.  But none so special as the love, care and devotion I was able to witness while Herb and Donna stayed with us to help care for their Jaci.  And yet, as much as we think we provided care, I really wonder if it is all of us who have been cared for and enriched by Jaci yet again.  Seize the moment for it is good.  <br>
<br>
In the midst of the cancer and the time it allowed us to contemplate, our conversation at times would reflect on those things we should have, could have or shouldn’t have done.  During one of these dark times as cancer ravaged a few of Jaci’s moments, came a gift from God and an understanding that all of our pains, misgivings, should haves and could haves can be overcome with three simple words….I…..Love…..You.  The past can be breached and the future embraced with these three simple words …I… Love… You.  Our home became filled with please, thank you, your welcome and I Love You’s.  Of Faith, Hope and Love, the greatest of these is love.  Seize the moment for it is good and pass it on….please!!<br>
<br>
Take time now to read 1st Corinthians 13, Versus 1-13  <br>
<br>
It is a special club.  A club that knows no color, or bias, a club whose members have been hurt by the loss of someone before what we as a human beings feel is before their time, but a club where amazing gifts are wrapped up for all to open and where enrichment in our lives can be found.  The true beauty when a sunrise has graced the closed shades in our living room window a color or hue never before seen or ever to be duplicated again.  A life that has graced us all with it’s own color and beauty.  A beautiful voice, a beautiful daughter, a beautiful wife and a beautiful mother, a beautiful arranger of flowers and of those she touched.     <br>
<br>
Forever your Love<br>
Dan <br>

I send you spiritual energy that your grief not be beyond what you can bear.  My heart is full of hope that you all find support in one another and with friends and family and in your caring church.<br>
<br>
I love each of you.  Please ask for help or a listening ear when you need it.<br>

Your great love for Jaci is so evident in your words.  I pray for all of you daily.  Please remember to seek out trusted individuals with whom you can talk.  Locking your feelings deep inside is not a healthy way to grieve.  I did that after my Dad died and it took much longer for me to finish the process.  Sam and Heidi, if you need someone who is non-judgmental, who has been where you are now, and if you are comfortable with it, since you don't know me well, please feel free to email me.  I would be more than happy to listen.  My email address is spms4@charter.net.  God Bless you all.<br>
