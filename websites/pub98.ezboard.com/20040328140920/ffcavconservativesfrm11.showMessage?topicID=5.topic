<br>
by Charles R. Hosler<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The environmental movement of the late 20th century to the present had its origins in the ecology movement of the mid 19th century. The central premise of this movement is that nature is a value regardless of its value to humankind. Two fundamental erroneous principles constitute this ecological philosophy: both life and non-life are part of a larger collective organism (e.g., &quot;Mother Nature&quot;, &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, &quot;Gaia&quot;); and, all available natural resources should be conserved, due to their inevitable long-term  loss due to human activities.<br>
 <br>
The lack of distinction between the living and non-living by core environmentalists has produced a major economic misunderstanding: this holistic biological viewpoint asserts that natural resources used are irretrievably lost. Conversely, as Einstein proved, energy is not lost in either physical or biological systems, as E=MCC defines that the redirection of energy does not represent a loss of energy. The fact that humans can transfer both energy and natural resources to enhance their lives, correlates with the principle that the more efficiently energy is used provides for a higher standard of living. <br>
 <br>
One would think that after the lessons of the 20th century, with the failures of Communism, Nazism, and other totalitarian regimes, environmentalists would realize that the individual must take responsibility for himself, rather than relying on the state. However,   today's environmentalists still hold to the view that capitalism, American-style, can only exist if humans do not alter nature with industrialization. Environmentalists have become religious zealots who refuse to acknowledge, by twisting and ignoring economic and scientific data, that an advanced technological society is safer and healthier than a non-technological society.<br>
 <br>
An historical review of the environmental movement in the United States is worth our attention, in order to examine their corruption of science and reason. The resurgence  began in the 1960s, highlighted by student activists that were explicitly anti-business, anti-family, anti-reason, and absolutely anti-establishment. This outlook was succinctly expressed by activist, Tom Hayden in 1968, &quot;First we will make the revolution, and then we will find out what for&quot;. Unfortunately, some of this radical naive mind-set persists within today's academia, in part, because some of the environmental extremists of the 1960s and 1970s are today's university professors and administrators.<br>
 <br>
Rachael Carson's publication, Silent Spring in 1962, although identifying some legitimate problems of pesticide use, blamed America's capitalism for all the problems. Carson's book was followed by Paul Ehrlich in 1968 who published The Population Bomb: Population Control or Race to Oblivion, which forecast worldwide death and famine if population and technology were not contained. Popular biologist, Barry Commoner, joined the scare scenario, by advocating a change in our Constitution to save the environment. A few prominent scientists joined the fray to give the movement scientific credentials. The fact that more than three decades later, these projections of doomsday have proven to be completely false, has not altered today's environmentalists from corrupting science and reason in order to further their political ideology: capitalism is individualistic, non-respectful of nature, wasteful of natural resources, and non-holistic.<br>
 <br>
The 1970s can be characterized by the corruption of science and reason by the environmental movement, with the help of some in the science community. The 1970 study, &quot;Report of the Study of Critical Environmental Problems&quot; and the 1972 study, &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;, both by the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, showed little understanding of how planetary systems work; and, these studies presented rates of growth and consumption, while ignoring the following salient features: the discovery of new resources; improved technology and more efficient utilization of energy and resources; and, population growth rates fall when industrialization occurs and standards of living rise. The creation of the U.S..Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, even though created to respond to legitimate environmental problems concerning pesticides, air and water pollution, toxic chemicals, and the use of resources, was based on the fundamentally flawed principles of holistic biology and resource economics. <br>
 <br>
With the establishment of the EPA in 1970, politics entered fully into the environmental agenda. Since then, the scientific method often has been ignored, replaced by political correctness in the attempt to prove that human activities are destroying our planet. Since 1970, all scientific principles have been prostituted by environmentalists, the media,  and some scientists, to argue that America's capitalistic system is destroying the planet. Most blatantly, today's environmentalists simply ignore facts that don't support their ideology; secondly, scientific findings are mis-defined, mis-classified, and mis-identified; thirdly,  attribution of effects is given to one cause, while ignoring other possible ones.<br>
 <br>
Several examples of environmentalism's assault on science and reason include:<br>
* After seven months of testimony by 125 expert witnesses during 1971-72, the evidence showed that DDT was not a threat to man or animal. Nevertheless, the EPA banned DDT, which subsequently has resulted in an estimated loss of millions of lives, worldwide.<br>
* During the debate of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment, Congress ignored an extensive body of scientific knowledge, completed by the 10-year study of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, at a cost of $600 million. The Amendment, passed by Congress, costs $10s of billions per year, with no effect on the few  lakes or small acreage of forests affected by acid rain.<br>
* In 1978 Joseph Califano, then Secretary of Health and Human Services, asserted that asbestos was killing 67,000 people per year. The impression that all types of asbestos are deadly has persisted to this day, costing $10s of billions per year due to regulations, although actual fatalities from asbestos run about several hundred per year.<br>
* The definition of &quot;wetlands&quot; has provided rationalization for massive violations of property rights.<br>
* Regarding mis-classification, the inclusion of subspecies and population as species, in order to create more endangered &quot;species&quot; under the Endangered Species Act, has been disingenuous; the Act also discourages hybridization.<br>
 <br>
During recent decades the scare scenarios of global warming exemplify all aspects of the assault on science and reason. None other than former Vice President, Al Gore, a Gaia worshiper, has espoused the pseudo-science exaggerations of environmental extremists. Some of the scientific facts and consensuses of global warming, either rejected or ignored by the environmental movement, include:<br>
* Is the climate warming?  Our most accurate measurements by satellite  show only a minute rise in temperature in recent decades.<br>
* Is this rise caused by human activities?  Any increase in global temperature, caused by human activities, is so negligible that it is difficult to measure.<br>
* Is our recent (last few decades) warming at the surface significant?  Probably not, since even a half of a degree Centigrade rise over the past 100 years is barely detectable and well within the range of natural variability; also, much of the recent warming at the surface can be attributed to increased urbanization (heat island effects).<br>
* Would future global warming be good or bad?  Most scientists and economists seem to agree that a warmer Earth is much better for humankind.<br>
* Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is not a pollutant; water, mostly in vapor form, is the predominant greenhouse gas. Recent studies (e.g., ice core analyses) indicate that carbon dioxide increases in the Earth's atmosphere are the result, not the cause, of the Earth's warming, with the exchange processes between the oceans and atmosphere playing a major role.<br>
* Despite what Al Gore or Science magazine report, it is not the consensus of the scientific community that global warming will cause future deleterious effects to our planet, due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.<br>
* The much-touted Kyoto Protocol, a proposed international treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing industrialization, would be completely ineffective in reducing global warming.<br>
* Adaptation is the only sensible answer to climate change, whether natural or human-caused.<br>
 <br>
The widespread rejection of the scientific method by the environmental movement since the mid 20th century, has manifested itself as a denial of reason, an outgrowth of the philosophy of 18th century's Immanuel Kant. He maintained that hypotheses can be proposed, validated, and accepted with never a reference to facts (science); reason is impotent and intuition (ideology) becomes supreme. This Kantian philosophical influence, which places human ideology (including pre-conceived ideas, feelings and emotions) above facts (truth), has led to the abuse of science that characterizes today's environmentalism.<br>
 <br>
A review  of the major environmental issues of our time, particularly those that have become politicized, shows that every major error of scientific induction has been committed to prove that human activities are destroying the planet. If the environmental movement continues to employ these corrupt Kantian philosophies, it will lead to the elimination of science as a source of truth, and a further erosion of our civilization.<br>
