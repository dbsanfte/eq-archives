The thing I normally do is take everything out of my bag and put them near the bat rack if it is okay for others to use. If a bat stays in my bag or near it when it is off limits which normally works. But here lately some of my teammates have begun to take bats out of my bag which makes me really hot. Recently we were at a tourney and everyone was using my u2 and one of my friends which was fine, no problem. We finish our game and go to walk off the other team enters the dugout and I hear hey did you guys leave this PST. Luckily we won and I was in no hurry to leave and looked back to see my long shell mint PST in this strangers hands. It has not been swung in a game in over 4 months and some yahoo takes it out of my bag. So I can loose. Needless to say I have begun to carry only the bats I am going to use. <br>
<br>
Several problems here though. No matter how well you know me don't go into my chit without asking. Don't take a bat out of my bag and leave it laying. I was very lucky because most people entering a dugout hope the last team leaves them something. And the person who took it out is lucky because I might be a puss but there would have been a fight had I lost it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C0D9D9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=batpimp>BatPimp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 469<br> <font color=#8B0000>(6/23/03 12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=350.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Other Players use of your own personal bats</span><hr size=1> My problem starts when someone uses something without asking. I let anyone and everyone on the team use my Wicked Composite this Saturday. Only one other guy even used it. <br>
<br>
Sunday I get picked up for a league for a different team and some guy just uses it without asking. I told him politely after the first at-bat not to use it again. He ended up taking one at-bat off, then using it again the third at-bat when I was on 2B. I was pretty hot about that and told him again. So the guy goes and pulls out the exact same bat BRAND NEW out of his bat bag. He had the same bat (one ounce heavier) and was just using mine to save swings on his. That's crap.<br>
<br>
With the cost of composites I usually say if you weigh more than me, you need to have your own bat. If its an important tournament, I might bend my rules. For a league I probably will keep my bat to me and girls only to save swings on it.<br>
<br>
Metal bats lasted practically forever if you didn't dent them. Composites have a limited amount of swings in them before they bust. They all will bust eventually. If you shell out $250-300 for a bat, I'd say you have every right to keep all those swings for yourself and not feel a bit quilty about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cstring84@oklahomasoftball>cstring84</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#8B0000>(6/23/03 1:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=350.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Bats??</span><hr size=1> This is a tough call!  I don't really want to be that guy that says &quot;I don't want anyone to use this bat.&quot;  Granted people spend alot of money on their own personal bats but bats are bought to be used.  Bats do not last forever and yes the more people that swing it the lesser the life for that bat.  That is what a warranty is for.  While under warranty I do not care who uses it but after the warranty is up and I have that new bat I am more protective of that bat.<br>
<br>
As far as some dumbass pulling a bat out of a persons bag w/o asking, that is BS!!!  There is a reason why it is in the bag.  Leave it in the bag and find another bat and if you ask a person to use a bat and they say no, don't get pissed, just find another bat to use or go buy your own bat.  <br>
