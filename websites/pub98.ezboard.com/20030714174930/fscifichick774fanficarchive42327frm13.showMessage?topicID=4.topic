Title: Malfaiteur<br>
Author: scifichick774<br>
Rating: R<br>
Category: D/R Romance/Drama/Angst/Suspense<br>
Spoilers: Through season 9<br>
Summary: A series of murders with Voo Doo ties brings the duo down to New Orleans to investigate.<br>
Disclaimer: As much as I wish it did, The X-Files does not belong to me. No infringement intended.<br>
Feedback: If you feel like it, just keep in mind that I have a delicate ego, so no flames please.<br>
Archival: Go ahead, just let me know where.<br>
Author’s Note: Where the show leaves off, with what I’m guessing is little to no resolution for Doggett and Reyes. Also, I have a habit of referring to John as Doggett and Monica as Monica, so I’ll really try to be consistent just by using last names or first names for both, but no promises.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“It was a dark and story night,” Monica Reyes joked, looking at the scene that awaited them as they exited the airplane terminal. A heavy thunderstorm had indeed begun about an hour before Doggett and Reyes reached New Orleans. Their plane had to circle a few times before finally landing safely. John Doggett gave her a look out of the corner of his eye.<br>
<br>
“Uh, huh,” he said with a sarcastic tone. He didn’t like storms, and Monica making fun of the situation wasn’t helping. She rolled her eyes and then looked at him. They stopped walking. He raised his eyes from the floor to meet hers. She relinquished a small smile.<br>
<br>
“You’re no fun, you realize that?” He grinned and took a step closer, then tilted his head.<br>
<br>
“Really?” She recognized the implication of the question and blushed slightly. Temporarily flustered, she shook her head. He couldn’t mean what she thought he did, and she decided to change the topic.<br>
<br>
“Well, at least not when it comes to X-Files.” She stepped away from him and began to walk again. Still behind her, he smiled, and almost chuckled. She turned her head around a little bit. “You coming or what?” He nodded and caught up with her.<br>
<br>
“So-ooo, rental car?” He asked, although it was more of a statement. She nodded in agreement. They both only brought their roll-on suitcases with them.<br>
<br>
“I don’t see their counter,” she commented, as she scanned the lobby. “They better not have booked us at an off site car rental place again, I don’t think we’ll get a taxi in this weather.” She furrowed her brow. Accommodations wise, things hadn’t been great since she started working on the X-Files, but they had gotten worse since Scully had left. It was like the agency was determined to pretend like their division didn’t exist. She felt Doggett’s hand on her back and looked at him. He motioned with his head.<br>
<br>
“There it is.” It was a tiny booth in the back corner of the lobby, its sign was unlit, but there was a woman behind the desk. They walked over to her and gave her their confirmation number and their names. She smiled a feeble smile that both of them recognized well, the smile of the overworked and underpaid, and handed them a set of keys after Monica signed the paperwork.<br>
<br>
“It’s in our lot, space 11-E. The shuttle will take you there.” The clerk said in a monotone voice, and then turned her attention back to her computer screen rather than giving a proper goodbye. They nodded, but didn’t smile, and made their way to the shuttle.<br>
<br>
Doggett was pleased to see that the car they had been given was a luxury model, as they were usually squeezed into the economy cars. They loaded their two suitcases into the trunk, Reyes got in on the driver’s side, and then she looked at him.<br>
<br>
“Guess somebody in accounting made an error huh?” She said, referring to the car. He grinned, and closed the passenger door.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, hopefully they made an error with our hotel too,” he answered. As she pulled out of the parking spot, she responded.<br>
<br>
“Don’t count on it.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
They arrived at the hotel, a typical chain hotel, but it seemed to be in good shape. The parking lot looked almost full. The rain was coming down even harder, and the two made a mad dash to get inside. The two clerks behind the desk were cheerful and chatting with each other. The boy, who appeared to be around 21, looked at the couple and gave a big smile.<br>
<br>
“Hi, welcome to the New Orleans Regency, my name is Damian, how can I help you?” He asked, his words flowing together in a unique Louisiana accent. Reyes gave him a smile.<br>
<br>
“Hi, I’m Monica Reyes, this is John Doggett,” she motioned to Doggett, “we have reservations.” The clerk nodded as he checked the computer monitor.<br>
<br>
“Yes ma’m. Good thing too, the hotel is completely booked.” Doggett ran his hand through his wet hair.<br>
<br>
“We noticed that your parking lot is full,” he said, trying to be amicable. “Something going on?”<br>
<br>
“Three different conventions in town, and one of them’s here. From what I’ve heard, just about every other hotel is booked solid too.” He responded, and then put a freshly printed sheet of paper onto the counter with a pen. “Just need you to sign here and I can give you the key to your room,” he said. Reyes signed and took the card key in an envelope from him.<br>
<br>
“Your turn,” she said to Doggett. He stepped up to the counter. Damian looked confused. “Something wrong?”<br>
<br>
“Well, uh, no. It’s just that the room that you had reserved was for both of you,” he answered. The agents’ expressions went solemn.<br>
<br>
“What?” Doggett asked, although he had heard perfectly clear what the clerk had just told them.<br>
<br>
“Whoever made the reservation requested a room for a Monica Reyes and a John Doggett,” Damian answered, and then clarified, “one room. Not separate rooms.”<br>
<br>
“Well, I’m sure that there was just some sort of misunderstanding,” Reyes said. “Is there any way we can get another room?” She gave him her best ‘pity me’ expression and a kind smile. He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“No, I’m afraid not. Like I said, we’re full up.” Doggett stepped away from the counter, and nodded at the clerk.<br>
<br>
“No problem, we can share,” he said, ushering Monica in the direction of the elevator. “Thanks,” he gave a little wave to Damian and Damian smiled.<br>
<br>
“Okay, have a good night,” he half yelled after them, as they stepped onto the elevator. Reyes turned to look at Doggett after the elevator doors closed.<br>
<br>
“We can share?” She asked, somewhat confused. Not that she minded spending a few nights in the same room as her partner; in fact she secretly looked forward to it. Secretly being the key word, the façade had to be kept up. Doggett gave her a reassuring smile.<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry Mon, I’ll be a complete gentleman.” Her expression softened. “No point in trying to find another hotel in the storm right? With them probably being full too?” He shook his head. “Besides, it’s not like we haven’t stayed in the same room before.” He looked in her eyes, and tried to read the expression he saw there.<br>
<br>
“Well, yeah, but there were two beds, or we were both on the floor,” she said, trying not to get too hopeful. Doggett’s eyes widened.<br>
<br>
“There aren’t two beds in this room?” He asked, silently thinking, ‘Oh crap, I’m in trouble.’ She shook her head.<br>
<br>
“One king size,” she murmured as she looked at the registration paper in front of her again, just to make sure she was reading it right. The elevator doors opened and they stepped out, wheeling their suitcases behind them.<br>
<br>
“Well, king size, that’s pretty big, shouldn’t be a problem,” Doggett reasoned. Reyes nodded. They reached their room and opened the door. Knowing something and seeing something with your own eyes were completely different things. “So where do we go first tomorrow?” He asked, changing the topic from the issue in front of them. She smiled, and ignored his question momentarily.<br>
<br>
“Which side do you want?” She asked. He stared at her briefly before answering.<br>
<br>
“I asked you first.” She sighed.<br>
<br>
“Fine.” She started to dig through a pocket on the outside of her suitcase, and pulled out a case file. She opened it up and sifted through the first couple of pages, and her eyes grew large. “How about here?” She asked in a somewhat surprised voice, still a little shocked by what she saw before her.<br>
<br>
“You wanna run that by me again?” Doggett raised his eyebrows. She shook her head a little bit and handed him the file.<br>
<br>
“The first murder took place here, at the Regency. Two floors above us.” She was trying to get him to give her some eye contact, but he kept his eyes glued to the papers in the file. In disbelief, he read the same lines over again, then looked up at her and nodded.<br>
<br>
“I want the side closest to the door,” he said. She smiled.<br>
<br>
“Okay, but you might want to opt for the loveseat,” she motioned with her head. He looked at her with skepticism.<br>
<br>
“You’ve gotta be jokin’.” She shrugged.<br>
<br>
“I’ve been told I can be kind of a bed hog,” she admitted, bowing her head a little as she pulled back the covers on the side closest to the window. Doggett smiled and came up close to speak into her ear.<br>
<br>
“I think I can handle it.”<br>
<br>

The sky was still dark, but the clock read 6:02am. His mouth curled into a grin when he realized that Monica’s leg was on top of his. ‘Guess she is a bed hog, not that I mind.’ He debated whether to wake her or not, but his decision was made for him when she stirred next to him. She looked up at him and repositioned herself.<br>
<br>
“Oh, um, hey,” she said with a little blush rising to her cheeks. She turned away from him and got out of bed. He smiled.<br>
<br>
“Mornin’,” he greeted. “You want the shower first?” She grinned and nodded.<br>
<br>
“That would be great, thanks John.” He grinned in response, only nodding his head slightly.<br>
<br>
“No problem.” She was digging through her suitcase for the things she needed. She had already unpacked her clothes the night before so they wouldn’t wrinkle.<br>
<br>
“Could you call the locals while I’m in there? Tell them to send over whoever’s working the case?” She had read their names in the file, but it was far too early to remember details like that. He walked over to look through the file for the detectives’ names as she made her way to the bathroom. He shook his head after she closed the door. His feelings for her had been growing over the past several months. He had even admitted to Audrey Pauley that he loved Monica, but hadn’t been able to tell her himself. He didn’t know how she felt. There had been inklings he had that she returned his feelings, things she said or did, but she hadn’t come out and told him that she liked him any more than as a close friend, and he didn’t want to screw things up between them. He picked up the phone to call the local police.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
An hour later, Reyes and Doggett were in a conference room at the local police precinct. Sergeants Devereaux and Chambers joined them. Reyes sat staring at pictures from the different crime scenes that were scattered over the table. Something caught her eye.<br>
<br>
“What kind of an idol is this?” She asked, holding out a picture of a bloody corpse, pointing to a small object in the background. Devereaux, a man in his early forties, took the picture from her and squinted at it.<br>
<br>
“This is Tollfer,” he said, motioning with his head at the victim. “So…” he paused and flipped through his notes, finally finding what he was looking for. “Eleggua.” Reyes and Doggett both looked at him. Doggett just stared at him, and Reyes looked at him expectantly for more information. He rolled his eyes, before Doggett shot him a warning look. He sighed. “Eleggua is considered to be the messenger between humans and the other Gods, in some cultures he is viewed to be the devil, in others a protector,” he read from his notes.<br>
<br>
“Tollfer was the first murder,” Reyes began, “so how does that correspond with the idol? Different idols were placed at each murder.” She was talking out loud more for benefit than for theirs, so she was surprised when Chambers answered her.<br>
<br>
“From what we were told, Eleggua is the one most Voo Doo religions make a sacrifice to first.” Then Chambers added in a mocking tone, “Without his approval, nothing can be accomplished.” Reyes remained quiet, trying to contemplate what the man had just said. Thinking that she was offended, he shrugged. “Sorry, that’s what our research said.” She nodded.<br>
<br>
“What was the idol at the second murder?” Doggett asked, suddenly interested. Devereaux flipped through his notes again.<br>
<br>
“Yemalla,” he answered. Anticipating the agents’ next question, he continued, “Goddess of sea and moon, bringer of wealth, owner of collective subconscious and ancient wisdom, often involved for fertility issues.” He rambled off the sentence in an uninterested, monotone voice.<br>
<br>
“Are we keeping you from something?” Reyes asked. He sighed and shook his head.<br>
<br>
“We have other cases, and although we love cooperating with the F.B.I., we’ve already checked out all the angles on these cases. Just seems like we’re wasting time,” he said.<br>
<br>
Reyes tried to quell her anger.<br>
<br>
“There are four dead people Sergeant Devereaux, and the killings are obviously connected, which brings it into our jurisdiction. And, whether you like it or not, you’ve been ordered to cooperate, so I suggest you put your religious bigotry aside and help us find the killer.” She managed to spew the words at the policeman without completely losing her temper, but Doggett knew she was awfully close.<br>
<br>
“Tell ya’ what, why don’t Agent Reyes and I go take a look at the crime scenes, and you two can have a break from helping us to work on your current cases?” It came out as more of an order than a question. Reyes sighed and slumped in her chair, and the two sergeants agreed and left the room. “They don’t care about finding the killer Mon,” he said in a hushed voice. “It’s been pushed off to us and they just want to work on their new cases now.”<br>
<br>
“It doesn’t seem like they were all that interested in finding the killer when the case was still theirs,” she said. He nodded and got out of his chair.<br>
<br>
“Let’s go back to the hotel, see if they’ve cleaned up the room yet,” he said, tactfully changing the subject. She gave him a small smile and haphazardly pushed all of the file materials back into the big brown expandable file she had been storing them in.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
The hotel manager on duty let them in to the room.<br>
<br>
“We haven’t cleaned it up,” he said to Doggett as Reyes pushed by him and went into the room. “Wanted to, but you know, unsolved murder and all that.” Doggett nodded.<br>
<br>
“Thanks,” he responded, looking at the general state of disarray and pools of blood around the room.<br>
<br>
“Sure. If you need anything, just give me a call. My personal extension from any hotel phone is 1257,” he said as he watched Doggett follow his partner into the room.<br>
<br>
“See anything that they didn’t already collect as evidence?” He asked Monica. She had her latex gloves on already and was examining everything. He started to put on his gloves.<br>
<br>
“Maybe. I think what we’re going to need to do is talk to someone inside the religion, someone who might know what the connection could be between the idols. I think that’s the key,” she said. He grinned.<br>
<br>
“Your instincts are usually the ones to follow on cases like this,” he complimented. She smiled and looked at him.<br>
<br>
“You mean because you don’t believe in any of this stuff?” He shrugged.<br>
<br>
“That could be it.” Something caught the corner of his eye and he moved over for a closer look. “What’s this?” He picked up a piece of folded up paper that had been shoved into the vent, and was just barely visible. Reyes came over and watched him unfold it. Her eyes grew wide.<br>
<br>
“It looks like a plan for the murder,” she gasped. It had instructions for what prayer to use, which idol to plant, which God to pray to, and what offerings to leave in addition to the body.<br>
<br>
“Great,” Doggett said sarcastically. “How could they miss this?” He shook his head. Reyes ran a theory past him.<br>
<br>
“Maybe because the vents haven’t been on. Until recently, they were having nice weather here. It could have blown up to a point where it got stuck in the grating when they were turned back on.” Doggett nodded.<br>
<br>
“Okay, that explains this one. What about the other crime scenes? They didn’t mention anything about notes being left behind at those ones.” Monica frowned.<br>
<br>
“Maybe the killer thought twice about leaving it behind at the other ones, or it was an accident that this one was left behind,” she reasoned. He dropped the paper into an evidence bag.<br>
<br>
“Well, it doesn’t say who the killer is, but maybe they left some DNA on it, or at the very least we can get a handwriting sample.” She stared at him.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, that will give us the profile of every other killer we have on file,” she commented. He smiled.<br>
<br>
“Ya’ never know Mon.” He decided to drop the topic. “Let’s drop this off at the lab for processing, then we can hit the second crime scene.” She nodded.<br>
<br>
“The St. Louis number three cemetery,” Reyes said dully. “It’s still raining pretty bad, do you want to check out the third crime scene instead? It’s indoors.” He chuckled as they left the room.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“I believe last night you were accusing me of being no fun because I didn’t appreciate being welcomed into New Orleans by a storm, and now you want to postpone going to the second crime scene because it will be muddy.” She laughed.<br>
<br>
“It’s completely different John,” she said, as they walked toward the elevator.<br>
<br>
“Uh-huh.” He grinned and she sighed.<br>
<br>
“Fine. After we drop off the note, we’ll go to the Martin crime scene, but don’t blame me if I need to come back afterward and take a hot shower,” she commented, walking onto the elevator. He cocked an eyebrow and leaned against the elevator wall with his arm, so his face was just inches from hers.<br>
<br>
“No problem,” he said, then made a mental note to not take too long at the next crime scene.<br>
<br>

Reyes and Doggett made their way back to their rental car.<br>
<br>
“So,” Doggett paused and cocked an eyebrow, “hot shower?” Monica laughed and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“I called around, a Mama Latia has agreed to talk to us about the different idols and how they might tie in to the murders. She owns a small store that sells items associated with Voo Doo and other magic based religions.” She turned forward, expecting him to start driving, but he didn’t. He hadn’t taken his eyes off of her. She looked back over at him. “What?” He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Nothin’.” He faced forward and began to drive to the cemetery’s exit. “So how do we get to this place?”<br>
<br>
“It’s not too far from here actually, just a few blocks.” He nodded and drove in the direction she indicated. They pulled up to an old building that looked like it should have been condemned. Doggett noticed the various symbols and paraphernalia in the window, indicating that they were definitely in the right place. He sighed and glanced over at Reyes expectantly.<br>
<br>
“Something wrong?” She looked mildly concerned. He forced a partial grin.<br>
<br>
“Have you taken into consideration that this woman could be the killer and we’re walking into some sort of trap?” She looked a little confused and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“You’re overreacting, you just don’t like places like this.”<br>
<br>
“No, I don’t, but I’m not overreacting. Think about it Mon, she sells the supplies that were found at each of the crime scenes.” He started counting the reasons on his fingers. “Her store is within a two mile radius of all of the murders…” Monica cut him off.<br>
<br>
“And she’s the only one who was willing to speak with us,” she nodded. “I know all that. But, if she’s not the killer then she could have valuable information to help us find whoever it is.”<br>
<br>
“And if she is the killer?” Reyes shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Then we have our guns,” she gave him a comforting smile. He grinned and gave a partial eye roll.<br>
<br>
“Fine. Let’s just get this over with.”<br>
<br>
They went into the store, shaking off their umbrellas yet again. It was dark, only lit by candles and a couple of small, covered lamps.<br>
<br>
“Perfect setting for a horror movie,” Doggett mumbled as he looked around at the skulls, snakes, and beads. Monica glanced over at him with a warning look.<br>
<br>
“Be nice,” she said in a hushed voice. He shrugged and grinned. A frail looking older woman watched them with her big brown eyes.<br>
<br>
“Agents Reyes and Doggett,” she said, a statement rather than a question. She came over to them. “You said you needed help with the your case?” She motioned for them to sit down on a large, plush sofa. She sat across from them in a high backed chair, and gave them a knowing smile. Reyes leaned forward.<br>
<br>
“I told you most of what we know on the phone, I was hoping you could give me the significance behind the idols and why the killer might be placing them at the scenes.” Mama Latia nodded, her arms on the arm rests.<br>
<br>
“From what you have told me, the people who were killed were not murdered, they were sacrificed.” Doggett’s eyes grew suspicious.<br>
<br>
“What’s the difference?” He asked somewhat sarcastically. She eyed him.<br>
<br>
“It is not necessary that you believe in the power our Gods hold, it is only important that the killer does.” Doggett frowned.<br>
<br>
“So what do you think the motive behind these killings, these sacrifices could be?” Reyes asked, still leaning forward. “I thought human sacrifice wasn’t part of the Voo Doo religion. From what I’ve read, most offerings are animal, or candy and rum.” Mama Latia gave a little snort and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“What you’ve read. What you’ve read was most likely written by observers, it doesn’t cover the ceremonies that haven’t been practiced in many years.”<br>
<br>
“So why start practicing them now?” Doggett asked, now leaning forward as well. A creepy grin crossed the woman’s face.<br>
<br>
“The idols that were found, give me the order they were found in.” Reyes flipped through her file.<br>
<br>
“Eleggua, Yemalla, Obatala, and Shango.” She looked back up at the older woman sitting across from them. Her face clouded with fear and her hands started shaking. She got up from her seat and started pacing.<br>
<br>
“This is not good,” she said. Doggett and Reyes looked at each other. “Whoever is making these sacrifices has great power, and seems to be getting stronger with each sacrifice.” Doggett looked at her skeptically.<br>
<br>
“How do ya’ figure?” She whipped her head around to stare the man down.<br>
<br>
“They have invoked the power of Shango,” she explained in a frightened voice. “Have you not seen the thunder storm that encompasses the area? The rains will continue to fall until a sacrifice is made to another God.”<br>
<br>
“So you’re saying this person is going to kill again?” Monica asked, already knowing the answer, since it matched the profile the F.B.I. had done. Mama Latia nodded.<br>
<br>
“They will continue to sacrifice until they receive what it is they seek,” she answered.<br>
<br>
“And what do they seek?” Doggett questioned. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
“I am not the one who can tell you that Agent Doggett.” Reyes and Doggett were on their feet now. Reyes reached over and placed a hand on the woman’s shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Thank you for your help,” she said, and they began to leave.<br>
<br>
“Wait!” Mama Latia cried out. Reyes turned back, but Doggett remained closer to the door, waiting for her. She pulled something out of a drawer and mumbled some words that Reyes and Doggett didn’t recognize, and then she blew some powder in Reyes’s face. She coughed and swiped away the residue with her hand. The woman smiled. Anticipating Reyes’s question, she said, “just a protection prayer.” Reyes nodded and left with Doggett.<br>
<br>
“What was that all about?” He asked after they ran to the car.<br>
<br>
“She said it was a protection prayer.”<br>
<br>
“Does she think you’re in danger?” He quipped. Reyes grinned.<br>
<br>
“I’m sure she was just trying to be nice.”<br>
<br>
“Uh-huh.” She lightly hit his arm in play. He smiled, but then had a serious expression cross his face.<br>
<br>
“What’s wrong?” He leaned toward her and captured her mouth with his. Although at first she was taken by surprise, she quickly returned the kiss and it became very heated. Protection prayer indeed.<br>
<br>

The car ride back to the hotel was long and in an uncomfortable silence. When they got there, there were two cop cars with their lights on parked in the parking lot. Doggett and Reyes exchanged looks of concern and made their way into the hotel, getting their badges ready in case there were any questions. They recognized Devereaux and Chambers right away and were acknowledged by Chambers nodding his head at them.<br>
<br>
“What the hell is going on here?” Doggett asked them. Devereaux was first to answer.<br>
<br>
“Looks like a normal killing,” he said non-chalantly. Doggett furrowed his brow. Devereaux grinned. “Doesn’t look like it has anything to do with your investigation though, so there’s no need for you to be here.” Doggett looked over at Monica who raised an eyebrow. He sighed and turned back to Devereaux.<br>
<br>
“We’re staying here,” he offered without further explanation. “Where’s the body?” Chambers rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Don’t you have enough work to do with the unsolved case you’re already supposed to be working on?” Reyes shot the man a glare that was deadly enough to make him back a couple of steps away from her in fright. “Right. Sorry. Body’s on the fourth floor.” Doggett and Reyes both frowned.<br>
<br>
“That’s the same floor Tollfer was murdered on,” Monica observed. Devereaux shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Coincidence,” Devereaux said. “This was a woman, she was stabbed several times, no candles, no idols, people heard the struggle and called hotel security. Like I said, a normal killing.” Doggett glared at him.<br>
<br>
“There’s no such thing as a normal killing,” he retorted. He and Monica started to walk toward the elevators. He turned around to Devereaux after taking a few steps. “And if you think there is then you need to get into a different line of work.” Doggett and Reyes continued on to the elevator and Devereaux gave Chambers an unreadable look.<br>
<br>
“You think they’re going to get in the way?” Chambers asked in a hushed voice.<br>
<br>
“They’re already getting in the way,” Devereaux mumbled. “They went to see Mama Latia today.” Chambers dropped his head.<br>
<br>
“Crap. She tell them anything?” Devereaux bit the inside of his cheek and shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think so. She knows how important this is. I don’t think she’d screw it up by talking to a couple of feds, and she’s not going to implicate herself.” Chambers frowned.<br>
<br>
“It’s her implicating other people I’m worried about,” he said, his voice still quiet. Devereaux nodded and then paused for a moment as if in thought. A sly grin came across his lips.<br>
<br>
“You know, we could get this taken care of real easy if we tell him we’ve found two more innocent victims.” Chambers grinned too.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but we don’t know if they fit the next criteria,” he said. Devereaux rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Please. Did you get a good look at them? If they’re not already sleeping together, then they certainly will be soon. We could get Latia to speed it up with some ‘lust dust’,” Devereaux quipped. Chambers smiled.<br>
<br>
“I’ll give her a call.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Doggett and Reyes just made it to the murdered woman’s room when John’s cell phone rang.<br>
<br>
“Doggett.”<br>
<br>
“Agent Doggett? This is Mary Hilliard with the forensics lab.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah? You find anything on the paper?” He asked with curiosity, looking over at Monica.<br>
<br>
“We found two sets of fingerprints and some DNA, looks like saliva. The fingerprints belong to Michael Devereaux, a sergeant with the N.O.P.D., and a Bernard Stapleton. The DNA belongs to your vic, Christopher Tollfer.” Doggett paled at the mention of Devereaux’s name.<br>
<br>
“Can you tell me the order of Devereaux’s prints on the paper? Does it look like he just picked it up without gloves?” ‘Always good to make sure before jumping to conclusions.’<br>
<br>
“No sir. His prints are widely distributed on both sides of the paper, as are Mr. Stapleton’s.” Doggett cringed in anger.<br>
<br>
“Can you fax those results to Assistant Director Walter Skinner at the home office with a request for a warrant please?” He asked in as calm of a voice as he could muster.<br>
<br>
“Of course sir. I’ll do that right now. Was there anything else that you needed?” Doggett shook his head even though he knew the woman couldn’t see him.<br>
<br>
“No ma’am, not right now, thanks though.” He hung up the phone. Reyes was standing there, rather impatiently, her eyes wide, and her face looking for an explanation. “Devereaux’s in on it.” Her mouth dropped open, but she quickly closed it. “I don’t know if he’s the killer or the planner, but he’s definitely in on it. Son of a bitch.” Reyes placed a comforting hand on his upper arm.<br>
<br>
“At least we found out in time to stop him from taking any more lives,” she said. Doggett shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I’m not so sure about that. You notice how anxious they were to keep us away from this crime scene, telling us it had nothing to do with our investigation?” Monica nodded.<br>
<br>
“That did seem strange,” she admitted.<br>
<br>
“How ‘bout we take a look?” He went over to the officer guarding the closed door and flashed his badge.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry sir. The forensics team is in there now, they don’t like anyone messing it up,” the young man said. Monica nodded.<br>
<br>
“Can you tell us whether they found any sort of Voo Doo paraphernalia in there? Candles, idols, that sort of thing?” He gave her a friendly smile, much too friendly for Doggett’s taste. As he felt the twinge of jealousy pass through him, he frowned and placed a possessive hand on the small of Monica’s back.<br>
<br>
“Yes ma’am,” the officer said, I saw lots of candles. Didn’t see an altar or idol or anything, but I didn’t go in and have a good look around.” He smiled again in an almost flirtatious manner, but stopped when he heard Doggett growl. He quickly looked over at Doggett and he saw an angry, territorial look in his eyes. The officer put his hand up to mouth to cough and then bowed his head. “Was there anything else?”<br>
<br>
“No,” Doggett responded, starting to lead Monica away from the door toward the elevators. She quickly turned around and said ‘thank you’ to the officer, who just grinned back at her.<br>
<br>
“Are we going to the room to pick up the warrant for Devereaux? I don’t think Skinner probably would have faxed it over yet,” she said. Doggett didn’t respond as they stepped into the elevator. He was still trying to quell his anger over the officer’s behavior toward Monica. “John?” He looked over at the concern on her features.<br>
<br>
“We’re going back to the room,” he stated. Monica nodded, a little confused.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think the warrant will be there yet. Do you want to get room service to send up some lunch?” He stepped closer to her, tilting his head, but she didn’t move away from him. He moved so that he was almost pressed against her, and then he leaned in, clutching her upper arm with his hand to keep her from moving. He looked directly at her, a mixture of lust and sorrow in his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Would it really be so bad Mon?” He asked, stroking her face with his other hand. She opened her mouth to speak but he moved in on it and closed it with his own. He pulled away from the kiss and half whispered in her ear. “I’m tired of this dance, it’s all or nothing.” He paused for a second, pushing his leg between her thighs. She let out a small moan. He nodded, the lust apparent in his eyes and his body language. “Good.”<br>

He glanced at the digital alarm clock. 4:53am. ‘Christ.’<br>
<br>
“Hello?” He mumbled into the receiver.<br>
<br>
“Agent Doggett?” Doggett rubbed his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Yeah.”<br>
<br>
“Hey, it’s Devereaux. Sorry to call you so early, but we think we might have a lead on your case for you.” Doggett grumbled incoherently and turned to wake up Monica. It was then that the memories of the night before flashed before him. He grinned.<br>
<br>
“Hold on Devereaux,” he said, offering no further explanation. He placed the receiver down on the end table. He leaned over and whispered in Monica’s ear, giving her a light shake on her shoulder with his hand. “Mon.” She stirred, but didn’t open her eyes. “Monica, wake up,” he said louder and shook her again. She slowly opened her eyes and smiled at him.<br>
<br>
“Hey.”<br>
<br>
“Mornin’.” She glanced over at the clock and furrowed her brow, then looked back at him.<br>
<br>
“A little early isn’t it?” She flopped her head back down on her pillow. He motioned to the phone with his head.<br>
<br>
“Devereaux’s on the phone. He said they might have a lead.” She raised her eyebrows in surprise. The last thing she had expected was for the local police force to actually help her, especially after the two detectives had been treating them so poorly. He picked up the receiver again. “Back,” he said, giving no apology for the time he made the man wait on the line. “Where do ya wanna meet?” He cradled the phone between his ear and shoulder, as he took down an address on the hotel stationary in their room. “Yeah. I got it. Give us a half hour.”<br>
<br>
He hung up the phone and looked over to Monica’s side of the bed, but she had already gotten up and was getting dressed. He pursed his lips, wondering if she regretted the previous night. “Mon?” She glanced over at him and briefly gave him a half grin.<br>
<br>
“You should get dressed John,” she stated in a neutral tone. “It’ll take a good twenty minutes to get there, even if there’s no traffic.” He nodded, knowing that she knew the area much better than he did, since she had lived there for a couple of years in the past. He got out of bed and Monica blushed slightly, and she turned to go toward the bathroom to hide it. He saw her blush, but didn’t mention it. Instead, he just smiled to himself, as he got dressed.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
The warehouse looked old and run down, and John’s suspicious instincts were running on overtime the second he saw it.<br>
<br>
“This doesn’t seem right. Why would they want to meet here?” She smiled a comforting smile at him and placed her hand on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
“I’m sure it’s okay. It’s not as bad on the inside,” she said. He narrowed his eyes a little at her.<br>
<br>
“You’ve been here before?” She shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Yeah. This is one of the locations where they make the floats for Mardi Gras. You’d be surprised how many times things came up here.” He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I still don’t like it,” he mentioned, putting a protective hand on the small of her back. “It’s not Mardi Gras time for one.”<br>
<br>
“Takes a long time to make those floats John.” He looked over at her and grinned. So far, despite the early wake up call, things were going better than he thought they would, except that neither one of them had brought up the subject of last night. That bothered him a little. He didn’t think she was ashamed of what they had done, seeing as how it had been building for some time, but it seemed like she should have said something by now.<br>
<br>
He opened up the door and they walked inside the warehouse. There were boxes along the walls, and frames for what would be floats in a few months time. He spotted Chambers in one of the corners, and nodded to him as a greeting. Doggett and Reyes walked over to him when he didn’t say hello or nod his head. As they got closer, they noticed a pool of blood around his feet. Monica’s mouth dropped open in horror. He was being held up straight by a pipe stuck through his back. Doggett winced and put his arm around Monica.<br>
<br>
“Let’s get out of here.” She nodded silently and walked with him back toward the door. When Doggett tried to open the door it was locked. “What the hell?” Reyes looked over at him, panic crossing her features. “You know another way out?” He asked hopefully. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
“But there’s got to be another way. A fire exit or something,” she quickly added. He nodded.<br>
<br>
“Let’s find it then.” They turned around to look for another exit and saw Devereaux and a man that Doggett didn’t recognize standing in front of them. “You wanna explain what the hell is going on here Devereaux?” Doggett asked angrily, moving his hand to get his gun out of its holster. Monica gasped when she realized where she recognized the man from.<br>
<br>
“Gordon Drake?” She asked, almost accusingly. He laughed.<br>
<br>
“I was wondering how long it would take you to figure it all out,” he sneered. She narrowed her eyes at him and Doggett looked over at her questioningly. She turned part of her head to look at Doggett.<br>
<br>
“Drake and I worked in the same field office here for a while,” she explained, then focused her attention on Drake again. “You’re the one who killed all of those people aren’t you?” He shrugged, completely unrepentant.<br>
<br>
“Not personally. The gods will only grant me the power I desire if I prove that I can control surrogates to do my bidding for sacrificial reasons.” Doggett shook his head.<br>
<br>
“You’re delusional.” Drake shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I’m not. I just finally realized the power that’s around me in the universe, just waiting to be granted. I just had to prove myself worthy.” He paused; an evil smile came across his lips. “Speaking of which, you two get to be my last sacrifices. You should feel very honored that you’ve been selected to help me achieve my goal.” Devereaux nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
“It’s a good thing the dust Mama Latia sprinkled on you worked, otherwise we would have had to choose a different couple.” Doggett and Reyes exchanged a look.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?” Monica asked hesitantly. Drake answered.<br>
<br>
“He means that if you two hadn’t had sex, then you wouldn’t be an acceptable offering to Oya. My transformation to a higher being would never be complete without her approval.” Doggett took the advantage of Drake directing his attention solely at Monica and pulled his gun from its holster.<br>
<br>
“If anyone’s gonna be sacrificed today, it’s you buddy.” He aimed the gun directly at Drake’s head. Devereaux took out a large knife and held it up in a threatening manner. Doggett, unfazed, looked at Monica through the corner of his eye. She got the hint. As Doggett and Devereaux were in a pissing contest, she grabbed her gun from its holster. Drake tried to charge Doggett and she shot him without hesitation. Drake’s body dropped to the floor, and as he lay bleeding on the ground, Devereaux seemed to lose all structure in his body, and he too fell down, as if the two were connected. Doggett came over slowly to Monica, who was still holding her gun out in front of her, pointed at the bodies on the floor.<br>
<br>
“Mon.” He reached out a hand and pushed her hands and the gun down. She looked at him. The unspoken silence between them said volumes. She glanced back at the door.<br>
<br>
“So how do we get out of here?” He grinned.<br>
<br>
“We’ll find a way.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
After about fifteen minutes, Reyes finally got her cell phone to work and they called 911. They were broken out of the warehouse by the fire department, and Doggett groaned at all the paperwork they were going to have to do. Now, they were in the hotel room packing up their things. Monica stopped and stared over at John. He noticed her pause and looked over at her.<br>
<br>
“You okay?” She nodded.<br>
<br>
“Just wondering.” She gave him a meaningful look. “Do you think we, you know, just because we were under the influence of some drug?” He raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Is that what you think?” She looked down. He walked over to her and lifted her chin with his hand. “God, Monica,” he said in a soft voice, “How can you think that?” She gazed longingly into his eyes, only seeing his love and respect for her reflected in them. She grinned and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, it’s just that we haven’t really talked about what happened, and…” He cut her off by pressing his lips against hers. The kiss began chaste but quickly progressed into passionate and needful. Monica pulled away so she could breathe. He gave her a big smile, almost devious.<br>
<br>
“You know Mon, we don’t have to take the 9 o’clock flight out of here. We could always say we missed it,” he said motioning to the bed. She smiled and laughed.<br>
<br>
“We could,” she agreed. He smiled and cupped her face with his hands, and leaned in for another kiss. They would have to catch the afternoon flight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FIN<br>
<br>
Finally the end! Feedback is welcome if you liked it, if not, just don’t tell me. <br>
