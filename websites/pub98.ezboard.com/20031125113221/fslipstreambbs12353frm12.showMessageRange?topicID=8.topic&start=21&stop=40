The fragments of glass glistening in the water sent Antimony's thoughts racing into the past . . .<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>From early childhood Antinomy had suffered greatly from the effects of the sun.  Even short exposures to sunlight resulted in what doctors described as sun poisoning and second degree burns over any exposed areas of skin.  Doctors had also forced her to take daily supplements for what they described as anemia.  <br>
<br>
As soon as she was able to strike out on her own, she did.  She traveled extensively and selected employment as a computer software engineer that allowed her to work at night or indoors or both.  She worked freelance; she hated being tied down to anyone or anything.  <br>
<br>
On the night of her 25th birthday she went out to socialize and celebrate with some colleagues and acquaintances.  Eventually she grew annoyed by the pounding music and pushing crowds and, taking her drink with her, stepped outside for some air.  The crowd was still thick by the club's entrance.  So she wandered down the street a short distance until the noise from the people began to fade.  <br>
<br>
She was lost in her own thoughts when he slipped up behind her and softly asked her name.  Antinomy startled at the noise and dropped the glass holding her drink to the concrete sidewalk where it shattered into several pieces.  The gentleman who had spoken immediately apologized for startling her and bent to begin gathering up the pieces of glass.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Antinomy,&quot; she said, &quot;You don't need to apologize; I should have been paying more attention to my surroundings.&quot;  She crouched next to him and began placing glass fragments into one of the larger pieces.  She took the remaining shards from the man and dropped them into a nearby receptacle.  When she turned back to face him, the stranger was staring intently at his index finger from which oozed a large droplet of blood.  &quot;You've cut yourself,&quot; she exclaimed.  <br>
<br>
Taking his wounded appendage in her hand, she impulsively raised it to her lips and began to suck the blood from the wound.  When she glanced back up at the man's face, the surprise and horror she saw there caused her to drop his hand and take a few steps backward.  &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I didn't mean to offend you.  Since you haven't yet told me your name, I probably shouldn't be sucking on your finger.  I've had quite a lot to drink tonight.  I hope you can forgive my presumption.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Thomas; and I will happily forgive, if you permit me to steal you away to a private location for an extended conversation in more comfortable surroundings,&quot; he responded.  &quot;I have a contagious blood condition and fear that you may have exposed yourself.  I don't want you to be frightened by the symptoms.&quot;  <br>
<br>
A few hours later, Antimony was wrestling with the fact that she had ingested the blood of a vampire, however unknowingly and however little.  Thomas had set out to feed; he had never intended to turn her.  Her actions had caught him off guard.  His master had not yet given him permission to turn others and he feared the consequences should his master discover his error.  After their talk he wanted nothing further to do with her, nor her with him.  She neither resented Thomas; nor felt any obligation or gratitude regarding him.  She wandered, masterless, after her change and valued her independence.  An odd case hers, other vampires she encountered often looked upon her with suspicion.  She had turned but she had never died.  She emptied others but had never been empty herself. <br>
<br>
In the end analysis her life had changed very little as a result of her evolution.  She was able to stop taking the supplements for her anemia once she began feeding; and she ceased developing new signs of physical age.  Thomas had viewed her as prey; but she had proven herself a predator.  She had to accustom herself to the taking of human life; but that wasn't as hard as it sounded.  She had always favored the death penalty; now she carried it out.  She was neither evil nor good.  She acted deliberately and thoughtfully. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Antinomy shook herself out of her reverie.  She'd waste no more time lost in maudlin thoughts of days past.  She decided to explore the nearby city in greater depth before she retired for the morning.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ladymeanoiche>Lady Meanoiche</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#0000ff, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/4/03 9:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.slipstreamunderground.com/images/succubus.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nightfall</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Amaya continued on in search of her next feed. Presently she came to a bar, a classy, upmarket kind of place, the type where they had hangups about people's footwear. Being immaculately dressed as always this didn't bother Amaya....she was used to these places.<br>
<br>
As she was about to enter she suddenly felt a hand on her behind. Quickly she turned round to see some punk guy, stoned and obviously heading towards a different kind of establishement, leering at her suggestively. She thought about killing him but quickly dismissed the thought. Why have a hamburger when you can dine on steak? Still she couldn't let him get away with such behaviour........<br>
<br>
Smiling sweetly at him she beckonned to him to follow her and walked slowly to a nearbye alley. It only took a moment but it was a moment the guy would remember for the rest of his life. But, as high as he was, no-one would ever believe him.<br>
