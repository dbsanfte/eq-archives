Hope all is well wherever you are.  We are swinging into the summer time schedule with Heidi out of school and Sam back and working the early (4:00 am) shift at the Overland Park Golf Course.  Heidi has a job lined up with babysitting on a more scheduled basis for a family in our old sub-division when she gets back from her Exaltation Church Choir tour.  Today she leaves to visit Mandy in Florida for a week.  Mandy and Heidi have been good freinds and have been very close as they both have leaned on each other for support during Jaci's illness and Mandy's parents recent divorce.  She gets back next Friday and leaves again Saturday for the four day Choir tour.  The biggest news around here is &quot;Tillie&quot;.  Tillie is a 8 month old German Shepard cross with a Husky female that was running loose for a few weeks in the Missouri countryside.  Heidi expressed a desire to have a &quot;puppy&quot; and boy is Tillie fitting the bill.  She is strong as an ox, still playful but very mellow when everyone else is mellow.  A couple by the name of Martin and Janine Fox found Tillie, and are very neat people.  Janine felt goose bumps when Tillie showed up as she had a illness where a dog played a very important role in her therapy.  Tillie is an instant treadmill for her walks with Heidi, Sam and I and loves the path we have access to close to our house.  Memorial weekend was a very reflective time for us.  We established memorials to Jaci in a couple places around the house and in each of our private spaces.  The weather was beautiful and a Lee's Purple Rhodo I purchased as a remembrance to Jaci looked stunning in it's setting.  Heidi was battling a sinus infection so took it easy but Sam and I were able to get down to downtown Kansas City to watch the Kansas City Symphony perform a patriotic tribute in front of the rejuvenated Union Station.  It was an awesome setting for the performance with great acoustics and being  backdropped against this massive landmark of Kansas City's railroad history.  While the symphony was wrapping up the crowd swiveled their chairs, blankets or seats 180 degrees to watch a gorgeously choreographed music scored fireworks display directly above another Kansas City Landmark called the Liberty Memorial.  The Liberty Memorial was erected in honor of those that gave their life in WW1.  It is interesting to note that the saying on the memorial states that this war was the war to end all wars.  How sad that we have not lived up to that hope....yet.  I am back to work and again the support for our family from everyone and the friends at work is immeasurable.  I ache for Jaci but she set the example of keeping her head up and forward looking so we will keep getting much of our strength and resolve from this knowledge.  It was also so special to see many of you during Jaci's services both in Owatonna and here in Overland Park.  The tributes, music, and gifts surrounding these services were special indeed if you did not have a chance to be with us.  It truly was a celebration of Jaci's circle of light and life.   Hope you all have a nice summer and we will check back later!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bbudignet.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slb22000>slb22000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FF9300>(5/31/03 8:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbudignetfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Memorial Day</span><hr size=1> We have a new dog, too.  Ours arrived on May 6th.  Sort of a struggle to get a dog then, but it had been arranged in April, so that's when we got her.<br>
<br>
Her name is GiGi and you can say that with a hard &quot;G&quot; like in goofy, or a French G like in Jacque Cousteau.  Myself, I use the French way.  She's a French poodle after all.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
She's 11 months old and black with a few silver strands on her back.  Purebred, pick-of-the-litter, calm, timid, tolerant, and gentle.  We all love her. <br>
<br>
When Carl and GiGi stand next to each other, she can rest her head on his shoulder.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It should be interesting to introduce GiGi and Tillie.  <br>
Love, Susan <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bbudignet.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mbudig>mbudig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FF9300>(6/2/03 8:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbudignetfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  hi</span><hr size=1> Dan -- it sounds like you are doing an incredible job of living, even while you are grieving.  Making memorials for Jaci sounds like a great way to help the healing.  I'm keeping a journal, attending a group for the newly bereaved, and examining my faith.  It's a tough time, but a necessary and growth-filled one.<br>
<br>
Belle, Janey, and Myka would all like to welcome their new doggie-cousins Tillie and Gigi to the family!  (Only Jane (our shepard/lab mix) would actually like to meet them, however :-))  And Fiona the cat sends her condolences to Peanut the cat on the addition of a dog to her home.  Fiona says it will take sometime but eventually Peanut should have Tillie cat-trained.<br>
<br>
I'm glad to see this forum keep going.  Our need for mutual support certainly hasn't ended, it's only transformed.<br>
<br>
All my love,<br>
Michelle <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Bud  Barb</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(6/2/03 5:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbudignetfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Thinking of you all</span><hr size=1> Hi Dan,Sam &amp; Heidi, Just want you to know we are thinking about you all as always.
