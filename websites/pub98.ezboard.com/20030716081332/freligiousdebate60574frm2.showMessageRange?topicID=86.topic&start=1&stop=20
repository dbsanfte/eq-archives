<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Great spirits</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have always found violent opposition from mediocre minds. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.&quot;<br>
--Albert Einstein<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
what was he referring to when he said &quot;great spirits&quot;?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;He who finds thought that lets us penetrate even a little deeper into the eternal mystery of nature has been granted great grace.  He who, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>in addition</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, experiences the recognition, sympathy, and help of the best minds of his times, had been given almost more happiness than one man can bear.&quot;<br>
--Albert Einstein<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
have you been denying yourself additional happiness that comes from understanding the eternal mystery of nature?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;There are only two ways to live your life.  One is as though nothing is a miracle.  The other is as though everything is a miracle.&quot;<br>
--Albert Einstein<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
i'm sure most people would choose the latter but, if so, who is the source of all these miracles?  us?  who is the source of us?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i wish that dumb lucky thing never happened if that's all it was...lucky for me i know better. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67@religiousdebate60574>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Convicted Skeptic</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/24/03 3:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: einstein speculations...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>what was he referring to when he said &quot;great spirits&quot;?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think he meant the Great Pumpkin, he was a worshipper of the Cult of Linus.  It couldn’t possibly be that he meant the human spirit.  No, no, no… it was definitely the Great Pumpkin.<br>
<br>
Your second quote is in reference to his appreciation of the support he received from other legends of science during his era.  He made the concession that he was lucky to have the gifts he had, and happier than one could bear for the collaboration of his peers.<br>
<br>
You seem to think that being an atheist limits your ability to appreciate the wonders of life and our universe.  You are so very wrong.  Only a cynic would choose not to appreciate all the wonders that surround us.  Only a sucker would choose to attribute them to something they did not belong.  Between the cynic and the sucker stands the skeptic.  As cocky as you want to be about how much more you know of the universe than the rest of us, I will content myself with knowing what I can prove and is supported by fact rather than pretend to knowledge I ‘feel’ to be true but that is not verifiable.  Why oh WHY does <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>someone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have to be the source of a mitracle?  Why would you think <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WE</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> were that source?  How amazingly egotistical and selfish!  Even Forrest Gump knew, Shit Happens.  Why can’t you accept that?  Oh, that’s right, god is on your side.  Even if the whole world is wrong, you and god agree so that is a majority.<br>
<br>
Do your research Dag.  Einstein was culturally Germanic Jewish and an atheist in practice, but he conceded the potential of deists.  Do not add to that more than there is, he was not xian.  The idea that he felt reverence for our universe does not metaphysically translate into some perverse endorsement of LDS doctrine, or any other hoopy theism.  He was a very nice man and didn’t want to thrust his beliefs into his research or frighten people by tearing down theirs.  He knew full well what happened if he wasn’t sensitive to the masses of rabid faithful.  He fled it in germany and he knew it from the legacy of Galileo and Darwin and other earlier pioneer scientists.  Quit disrespecting his memory and trying to baptize him beyond the grave into support of your position.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The religious feeling engendered by experiencing the logical comprehensibility of profound interrelations is of a somewhat different sort from the feeling that one usually calls religious. It is more a feeling of awe at the scheme that is manifested in the material universe.

There is in this neither a will nor a goal, nor a must, but only sheer being.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> -Albert Einstien<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events. To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot. But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. For a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself. This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> -Albert Einstien<br>

life turns into an illusion without faith.  as soon as my faith leaves me the universe disappears and i cease to exist.  you call me ignorant and i consider myself the luckiest spirit alive to know there is a purpose to it all...<br>
<br>
what are the conditions to spawn life again?  why can't i reproduce it?  we should probably put our heads together and figure it out and start the evolution process in other parts of the galaxy so that other people will have no purpose of existing as well a few million years from now.<br>
<br>
without purpose for existence my goal then becomes &quot;try to be the happiest most successful part of the dream&quot;  that's harder for me to do but it has worked for a lot of you so keep it up.<br>

&quot;Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.&quot;<br>

<br>
Not everyone refers to spirits as something supernatural.  It could be referred to as character or personality.  If I tell you &quot;don't yell at your child too much because it will break his spirit&quot;, then I'm not getting all religious on you.  I'm just telling you that you'll have a depressed child.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;have you been denying yourself additional happiness that comes from understanding the eternal mystery of nature?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nobody understands the eternal mystery of nature.  If they did, then it wouldn't be a mystery anymore.  Science has mysteries that people are trying to solve everyday.  The origins of the cosmos are also still a mystery, and scientists can develop theories over how science created life while theist develop theories over how a deity created life.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;i'm sure most people would choose the latter but, if so, who is the source of all these miracles? us? who is the source of us?  i wish that dumb lucky thing never happened if that's all it was...lucky for me i know better.&quot;<br>
<br>
You may ask who, but many others ask what.   There are lots of things within nature that seem to serve no purpose.  Take male nipples for example.  Why would an intelligent designer give men nipples?  Even nature has its imperfections, but if there was an infallible &quot;who&quot; behind it, then  those imperfections wouldn't exist.  How did men get nipples?  Shit happened.<br>

Dag, what ever makes you think atheists &quot;have no purpose of existing.&quot; Einstein was an atheist, are you saying he had no purpose?<br>
<br>
Just because we don't believe we are going to live forever and ever, or that we're here to have our imaginary souls &quot;perfected&quot; doesn't mean we have no purpose.<br>

What a sad, pathetic thing to say. I am so sorry for you but hold out the hope you can see there is purpose in life and that if you stop believing in the soul fairy you will not disappear in a cloud of smoke.<br>

The conditions to spawn life again are the same ones that started it here.  High CO2 content, water, heat, carbon, electricity (lightning) in a contained unit.  You can’t reproduce it because you are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ASSUMING</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it can’t be done.  It has.  Often.  It's a fairly common experiment.  Sterile glass sphere, full of cosmic soup.  Incubate and taa-daa, the basics of life.  Without purpose for existence your goal may become “be[ing] the happiest most successful part of the dream” if that is what you choose, but that is your choice.  It could also become “be the most stubborn PITA theist and spread my dogmatic lies as far as possible” if you so choose.  Oddly enough, the universe doesn’t change either way.<br>
<br>
Honestly Dag, your surrender to the hopelessness of atheism is pathetic.  Just stop trying to argue it if you (as you put it) cannot get it.  If you don't want to see the truth, stop looking and keep your self-deceptions.  Defining yourself through your beliefs is unhealthy.  If they are ever shaken you lose any self-worth.  That is how suicides occur, breakdowns and breakups.  I’d hate to think you’d jeopardize your life, your relationship with your wife or the well being of your children just to keep the invisible friend and security blanket wrapped around your head.  That at the end of it all, you look back and realize what a waste you made of time and energy that could have better served your family but you dumped into this fiction instead.  I will continue to hope better for you, good luck.<br>

<br>
The earth is very old.  Several billion years old.  The earth cooled for a billion years before life started.  It was another billion years after that for multicellular life.  Do you have ANY idea how much time that is?  <br>
<br>
So scientists do experiments like putting cosmic soup in a sterile environment and emulating the atmospheric pressure and conditions of primitive earth and see what forms.  The fact is the chains formed were in keeping with expected proto-amino types that would become the building blocks of cells.  If something bizaare formed like toxins or other chemicals that all life on earth WEREN'T made from it would break the theory, but it didn't.  The simplest of the replicated molecules formed.  As expected, the essentials of life. <br>
<br>
If you are looking for an ameoba in the soup it has to simmer for about a billion years.  Now go to the bank and get $10,000.00 in pennies, that is a million objects.  Do that 1,000 times.  That is a billion objects.  The scale here is enormus.  Now if you want that ameoba to be a fly, well mon frere you need to do this coin exchange twice.  I should point out that our sun will die long before you do any of that, but hey, since you aren't doing the reading it will keep you occupied until then. <p>DBC67<br>

i found some actual measurable data that suggests that the earth isn't as old as the theory of evolution mandates.  i'm not saying that i agree totally with this guy's opinion but it does warrant some explaining as to why the continents aren't sea level when erosion has been observed at a measurable rate.  here is the summary of his main points.  one i'm not sure about is if there should be a more gradual line of fossils he claims that are no fossils at all which is obviously false but maybe there should be more stages between species like 1000s of transitional forms.<br>
<br>
anyone care to refute some of these points?<br>
<br>
1.     Not enough mud on the sea floor- Erosion would deposit the present amount of sediment in less than 12 million years, but evolutionists say the oceans have been around at least 3 billion years.<br>
<br>
2.     Earth's magnetic field is decaying- At the present rate of decay the field could not be more than 10,000 years old. The rate has been at a constant rate of decay and is measurable. Life would have been impossible millions of years ago because the magnetism would have killed everything and crushed the earth flat.<br>
<br>
3.     Polonium in granite rock- An element called polonium in granite rock all over the world has proof of rapid creation. The energy released by polonium makes a colorful radiohalo in its brief few moments of solidifying into granite rock. This energy is frozen around the element, which shows that granite rock was made quickly (as in created) and not cooled over millions of years.<br>
<br>
4.     Helium in the atmosphere- All radioactive elements generate helium as they decay. If such decay took place for billions of years then much helium should have found its way into the Earth's atmosphere. The rate of loss from the atmosphere into space is calculable and small. Taking that loss into account, the atmosphere today has only 0.05% of the amount of helium it would have accumulated in 5 billion years.<br>
<br>
5.     Earth's history is too short- According to evolutionists, stone age man existed for 100,000 years before beginning to make written records about 4,000-5,000 years ago. Prehistoric man built megalithic monuments, made beautiful cave paintings, and even kept records of lunar phases. Why would he wait a thousand centuries before using the same skills to record history? The biblical time-scale is more likely. If we have been around for 100,000 years then why do we not have 100,000 years of history and ruins?<br>
<br>
6.     Erosion- At the present rate of erosion, all the continents on earth should be eroded to sea level in only 14 million years.<br>
<br>
7.     Build-up- Underneath the Lincoln Memorial in D.C., 5 feet of stalactites have grown in under 50 years. These stalactites have grown nearly 2/3 inch per year! So much for the &quot;thousand years per inch&quot; idea. There is a photo of a bat covered by flowstone in a cave before he could rot. Imagine how long this bat would have to lie dead, without rotting, for the flowstone to cover it as it did! Obviously, these mineral deposits occur much more rapidly than we are led to believe. The Great Barrier Reef, the oldest and largest reef in the world, had been determined to be 4,200 years old. Looking at the statistics conservatively, the entire earth's crust could have developed without any other processes besides volcanism in just 500 million years. That throws the evolutionary timescale off because there would have been no land during the cambrian period.<br>
<br>
8.     Niagra Falls- The rim of the falls is wearing back at a known rate each year. It has only taken about 5,000 years to erode from its original precipice.<br>
<br>
9.     Trees- In the White Mountains bordering California and Nevada, there are bristle cone trees that have been dated at around 5,000 years old. If no major catastrophes occur then they should live for thousands of years. Think about it. If these trees have lived successfully for 5 thousand years (about the time of the flood), why have we not found any trees 8, 10, or 15 thousand years old?  <br>
<br>
10.    Animals are unchanged- Contrary to popular belief, the majority of fossils are not of extinct types of animals. Most fossils are very similar (and quite often identical) to creatures living today.<br>
<br>
11.    Fossil record- With the millions of fossils already discovered (and the sediments already explored) we still have zero fossils proving evolution.<br>
<br>
12.    Coal formation- Coal was not made in swamps over millions of years. Various coal layers in the U.S. consist mainly of sheets of tree bark rubbed off from huge masses of uprooted trees. The bark layers were buried in mud and carbonized into coal after heat is applied. All this would happen with a worldwide flood. Human skeletons and artifacts, such as intricately structured gold chains, have been found in coal deposits. Plant-derived material has been converted into a good grade of petroleum in as little as 20 minutes under the proper pressures and temperatures. Wood and other cellulosic material have also been converted into coal or coal-like substances in just a few hours. This proves that the formation of coal, oil &amp; gas did not require millions of years to form. Creationists believe that the great coal deposits of the world are the transported and metamorphosed remains of the extensive vegetation of the antediluvian world. This catastrophic intepretation is further supported by the presence of polystrate fossils in coal beds that indicate rapid formation.<br>
<br>
13.    Mississippi River- If we really have been around as long as evolutionists say we have, then the Mississippi River would have filled in the Gulf of Mexico a long time ago. Approximately 300 million cubic yards of sediment are deposited into the Gulf of Mexico by the Mississippi each year (you do the math).<br>
<br>
14.    Population- The rate of population growth has been steady for the time that we have records. The 8 people that survived the universal flood about 4400 years ago would have multiplied and produced the present 6 billion people we now have. If man had been around for millions of years, the same growth rate would have produced 150,000 people per square inch of land surface. Today, the entire world's population could fit into the area of Jacksonville Florida 3 times over.<br>
<br>
15.    Oil Pressure- The impermeable cap rock encasing petroleum and oil deposits could not withstand the tremendous pressure for more than a few thousand years. The rocks that contain it are porous. If the oil had been there for millions of years the pressure would have dissapated long ago.<br>
<br>
16.     Ocean salt- Minerals being washed into the ocean by erosion would bring the salt content of the ocean to its present level in less than 5,000 years. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/4/03 10:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Evolution</span><hr size=1> Oh boy dag finally found the &quot;young earth&quot; sites...weeeee<br>

The oceans have been around at least 3 billion years.  The creationists site it as a stagnant system with no output, only intake.  No allowances for volcanic activity, tectonic sublimation or continental drift.<br>
<br>
2. Earth's magnetic field is decaying- fields of this nature decay in what is known as a half life.  the statement that it is a constant rate is a blatant lie.  It has been at a constant rate over the last century because the time scale is so vast as to make the 100 year time fram shift a negligable and immeasurable difference.  Furthermore, the inconsitancies within the field itself (it jumps around in strength for natural reasons) are a wider margin of variance than its actual decay rate.  Meaning the only way to measure its decay accurately would be to measure it across the entire globe, constantly and simultaneously for a few thousand years.  Please also note, magnetic fields don't pin your knee to the fridge because they only affect ferric materials.  There is no reason to think the field would 'crush everything flat&quot; anymore than you can hang your son's art on your chest with a fridge magnet.<br>
<br>
3. Polonium is a work of fiction.  An energy field cannot be 'frozen' - energy is not matter and thus has no physical capacity to be locked in place.  Even were this marvel of myth real, it could just as easily be explained in terms of rapid cooling by, say water emersion, rather than &quot;creation'.  With seas as prevalent it wouldn't be hard to find water just about anywhere.<br>
<br>
4. Helium in the atmosphere is consistant with the facts.  Some assumptions are made int he calculation such as nature and quantity of core isotopees under the mantle.  If you widely skew this beyond limit of current earth science expectations, you can make the equation result in bad data.  Garbage in, garbage out.  Bad math on the creationist side selecting all worst variables and crunching backwards from the answer they want to the assumptions they need to get it.<br>
<br>
5. If we have been around for 100,000 years then why do we not have 100,000 years of history and ruins?  Very simple my dear watson.  Our system of knowledge building is limited by technology at hand, communications systems available and some basic math rates.  There is a description of the system where data collection and manipulation is doubling at an increasing rate.  This is consistant for our entire history.  How do you work at microsoft and claim a CS background and not know this?!?  We in fact DO have 100,000 years worth of history and ruins, just not megalithic ones like the pyramids of gaza or colleseums.  It took time to develope that level of technology to do.  How easy it is for you to sit on a beach with your modern education and'feel' the geometry of how a suspension bridge works or a flying butress supports.  Yet we have no instinct for it, the feeling is a lie.  Every gain in our knowledge is built on the backs of every person to go before us.  We like stability, we don't like change, for thousands of years we were satisfied with egalitarian hunter/gatherer societies.  No one was brewing beer, no one was tilling hectares, no one was sending UPS.<br>
<br>
6. Erosion- this does not take into account the counter point to the system, which is the subluxation and extrusion of plate techtonics.  One edge of a plate rubs against another.  It either subluxates beneath the edge, or extrudes over the edge.  Where you have extrusion, you get mountains.<br>
<br>
7. Build-up- Buidld-up is a function of mineral availability and water flow.  The surface under the Wash Mon. is hardly untampered with by man and is a rotten example to select.  The luray caverns or other natural and sizable formation would be better.  The large scale areas remain in keeping with the data.  As always, a few select abberations to the data can occur where the basic framework is altered such as by human engineering or emersion in water, but these still fit the models as presented by the data.  As far as &quot;the entire earth's crust could have developed without any other processes besides volcanism in just 500 million years&quot; we already know of several factors including continental drift that exist besides vulcanism, so this statement is wholey without merit.<br>
8. Niagra Falls- The rim of the falls is wearing back at a known rate each year.  That rate furthermore was accelerating and (due to human engineering efforts) is currently slowing. It has only taken about 5,000 years to erode from its original precipice.  While this is all nice and interesting, it has ZERO significance, as that only means the estimated formation as 5,000 years ago.  Prior to that water flowed by a different route!  How hard is that to appreciate?<br>
<br>
9. Trees- You state the answer yourself, there have been catastrophes.  Spell it with me F-O-R-E-S-T   F-I-R-E<br>
<br>
10. Animals are unchanged- Where did you pull this bull crap from?  Go to the museum of natural history in DC or NY and LOOK at the fossils.  You can see over time the changes in skeletal formations.<br>
<br>
11. Fossil record- more BS.  Every fossil fits quite nicely into the substantive record PROVING evolution as a force in our environment.<br>
<br>
12. Coal formation- Again, you ask for a single solution to a system that has multiple causations.  Coal can form in swamps, it can form in sea beds, it can form in labs, it can be excreted by bacterium in petri dishes.  Yes, in a scientific lab under carefully controlled conditions you can make it in 20 minutes.  None of these conditions occur in nature(except maybe on the surface of mercury if we planted trees there) and you can also make coal in a few million years in a swamp.<br>
<br>
13. Mississippi River- More fun with numbers.  A) you are applying current rates backwards in time as though they are a consistant schema, and they are not.  B) you are assuming a closed system with no means for the gulf to eliminate sediment itself (like off into the atlantic maybe?) C) The system you suggest would mean the earth were actually less than 3,000 years old and that the middle american plains were above water the whole time.  This is inconsistant with the data.<br>
<br>
14. Population- This is just stupid.  You take no account of pathogenic impact (plagues?) environmental controls (starvation?) or humans treatment of other humans (inquisitions - yay god!).  No population can grow beyond its ability to feed and support itself, to have 1 person for every 3 square inches is just dumb.  <br>
<br>
15. Oil Pressure- Okay, I have said plate techtonics a few times now.  Lets be clear, the system is NOT static.  It moves, it changes, it is dynamic.  Pressures build up, pressures dissipate.  You cannot in the same statement say the rock is impermiable, then say it is porous and claim the system is static.<br>
<br>
16. Ocean salt- This is also a dynamic system.  As ice caps increase salinity increases, as the decrease, salinity decreases.  When saturation points are reached (and they vary around the globe based on temperatures) then minerals settle out of solution.  Funny how it hovers equatorily at arond 0.9% - ironicly isotonic.<br>
<br>
Dag - it would seem your vacation time was not spent reading any of the recommended texts.  These are weak arguments easily refuted by any primary level Earth Science course.  Please, go to the skeptic society website and get a copy of their manual <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>How to Debate a Creationist.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  It is very nice of them to present all their arguments in a nice publication for you to study and try and find a flaw in.  If you can present logical reasoned arguments that disprove their data, I would entertain abandoning their position.  Please note however, that disproving their system does not automatically prove yours.  To prove yours it has to do a better job of explaining the known and predicting the results than the current system.  &quot;God did it&quot; does not look like it will be doing that anytime soon.  I am disappointed, I had hoped you took this time to read and study, not dig desperately for another straw man. <p>DBC67<br>

Since you have such concern for the world being 8,000 years old, perhaps you could explain a few things for the rest of us.  This should be good because for a change I get to ask you a question and you can go out and research it and come back to present it to us.<br>
<br>
1) light travels very fast, but not limitlessly fast.  How is it that light is reaching us from stars and galaxies vastly removed from us in space that would take longer than 8,000 years to reach us if there was a 'rapid creation' as you describe it?<br>
<br>
2) Ice layers form every year on the poles, how is it that there are more than 8,000 of these layers?<br>
<br>
3) What were dinosaurs and why did they exist at all?  If they are gone, where did they go and why?  Do you think they can come back?<br>
<br>
4) Why, if evolution is so controvercial, are none of these &quot;scientists&quot; who have conclusive proof against it not being published in the trade journals and studies?<br>
<br>
5) Why doesn't carbon dating work?<br>
<br>
Hope you can get started on these, I can offer more if you feel it unfair for me to stop at 5 instead of matching your 16.  Go do some reading, evaluate it critically before just posting it and make sure you agree with and support the position you offer us.  Engage your mind, don't just spew another persons rhetoric.   Then we can debate.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to your reply. <p><br>

I guess the age of the world just depends on whose history you happen to be reading.<br>
<br>
Interesting to note that the age of the universe in Hindu cosmology and that of most astronomers jibe almost perfectly.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Pagles</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(2/7/03 1:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  RE:Evolution</span><hr size=1> &quot;If we have been around for 100,000 years then why do we not have 100,000 years of history and ruins?&quot;<br>
<br>
Are those hills or remnants of fortifications? Look at Notre Dame, a modern church on top of a Roman temple  on top of a neolithic settlement. And no one knew it until just a couple centuries ago! Those weird mounds in the midwest turned out to be burial grounds for native americans.  The  european immigrants settling the area had no idea that's what they were. Who knows what is buried under all the accumulation of just 4000 years of settlement?<br>
<br>
Plus, if you are living a migratory subsitance lifestyle, which eveyone was pretty much until the beginning of agriculture, there isn't much brickwork to go on. And no real need for recordkeeping either. The idea of property started writing, not some push to record history. It was about wealth.  Interesting how bricks and writing coinside with the sudden rise of powerful priesthoods, too. <br>
<br>
Want to obliterate the heritage of the people you just conquored? destroy every scrap of writing, every ritual, every placename.  <br>
<br>
that just might explain why there isn't 100,000 years of artifacts and literature to go on. <br>

&quot;I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals Himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.&quot; - Albert Einstein (numberous occasions)<br>
<br>
My religion consists of a humble admiration of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in the slight details we are able to perceive With our frail and feeble minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible Universe, forms my idea of God. <br>
Quoted in the New York Times obituary April 19, 1955 <br>
<br>
&quot;In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for support of such views.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
