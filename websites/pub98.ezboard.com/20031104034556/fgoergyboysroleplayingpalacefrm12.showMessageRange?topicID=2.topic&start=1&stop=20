I only require a few things from those who wish to sign up.<br>
<br>
First things first, I am going to need a Profile<br>
<br>
Name:<br>
Age:<br>
Height:<br>
Weight:<br>
Hair/Eye color:<br>
Race:<br>
Deity:<br>
<br>
Personality/motivation:<br>
Abilities: (3-5 max depending on amount of magic)<br>
Single use/Limit break type ability:<br>
Magic: <br>
Magik:<br>
Weapon/s: <br>
<br>
History:<br>
<br>
<br>
The only thing I ask for in profiles are NO God characters. I want this thread to be as legit as possible. That doesn't mean I necessarily want expert roleplayers. But the objective of this thread isn't victory or defeat. Rather the objective here is the story. So regard any fighting as more of a sparring match or a dance. <br>
<br>
1.) Have a weakness<br>
2.) Do not post anothers persons actions without their consent. Also allow your actions to give your opponent a counter action.<br>
3.) Do not be invulnerable to attack, fatigue, etc etc. <br>
4.) Do not be able to miraculously recover from any injury. Fact is I would like to see a character or so die! A character can always be revived for a later story, and you are allowed to have more than one character/profile! However, only the actor/roleplayer can consent for their character to be killed. Even the storyteller is over-ruled here.<br>
5.) Please please please do not roleplay ridiculously strong characters without consent from the storyteller.<br>
6.) I have no problem with people being able to fly, or teleport. But I want these abilities kept on a REALLY short leash. You can only fly for a very limited amount of time, and teleporting can only be done for very short distances at the expenditure of ALOT of energy. If you can teleport, then you can't do it without consequence.<br>
<br>
All profiles will be approved by myself and selected others. If your profile is not approved, then you shall be summarily &quot;banned&quot; and ignored by everyone in this thread.<br>
<br>
StoryTellers <br>
<br>
I will be the first storyteller. The responsibility of the storyteller is to create a scene for the roleplayers to &quot;act&quot; in, and direct it. <br>
Mini or assistant storytellers can be assigned at any time to help advance the story. Another responsibility of the story teller is to &quot;fill&quot; in plot holes, and roleplay smaller characters.<br>
<br>
StoryTeller Privaleges <br>
<br>
Basically the storyteller can be viewed as a &quot;dungeon master&quot; or a MMPORPG GM (Game master)<br>
<br>
1.) The ability to create any character at any time for whatever reason. <br>
2.) The ability to move other people's character, and manipulate their actions/reactions.<br>
3.) The ability to resurrect killed players.<br>
4.) The ability to change the environment to suit the story (Ie: Volcanos, earthquakes, floods, etc etc)<br>
5.) The ability to grant certain profiles greater in strength or importance than other profiles.<br>
6.) The ability to disapprove/approve of another characters actions.<br>
7.) The ability of narration<br>
<br>
<br>
I will post more story teller privaleges and abilities as I come across them. For future reference, even though the ST has alot of &quot;power&quot; they are still bound to the plot of the story. Also remember that a ST does not have the ability to kill a character without consent of the roleplayer.<br>

<br>
History<br>
In the beginning, there was Lumos and Umbra. These two opposing forces fought to dominate the other. In their war a cataclismic explosion occured, their energies reacted to form a spherical mass. With curiosity both light and darkness stopped and examined that which they had created.<br>
<br>
Lumos was fascinated and began to exert his ownership. But because the world was created from both his and Umbra's powers he could not directly manipulate it. Because of that he created beings that would serve his purpose.<br>
<br>
He created Arca and with him place the energies of the land in harmony. He gave order to the forces of the land and tamed it.<br>
<br>
Ferra the being of life created the creatures that swim its seas, fly its skies and walk its grounds.<br>
<br>
Gestiya made all the things that were created beautiful.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Umbra was astonish with what Lumos has done. He saw the beauty of it but there are things lacking. Secretly he created his own beings to supplement what was Lumos.<br>
<br>
He created Helos and gave him dominion over death.<br>
<br>
Krya was the being created that gave pleasure.<br>
<br>
Nyfary was created to cause mischeif<br>
<br>
<br>
Lumos was outrage with what Umbra has done. With that they waged war against each other again. In that was they created the beings of chaos.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Poimios the holder of sickness<br>
<br>
Arvion the bringer vengance<br>
<br>
Deimios the abuser of discord<br>
<br>
*Coolrain's work some names created by myself*<br>
<br>
Race/Religon<br>
The world of Nygard has become the stage for an all out god war. Trolls, demons, elves, dwarves, gnomes, humans, ogres, orcs, and halflings have all joined the war for their gods.<br>
<br>
On one side the Casters of Shadow. A group who pledged themselves to the beings of Umbra and the ways of darkness. In this group all forms of races were found, but the majority was comprised of trolls, ocs, and ogres. Not all of the members of these races were dark, there were exceptions, wether full blooded or halfling each one had their own view, although the ways of darkness were forced upon through the natural order of life and death.<br>
<br>
On the other side was the Blaze of Light. This group pledged themselves to the beings of Lumos and the ways of light. As with the Caster of Shadow all races could be found, but in much lesser quanity than the Casters of Shadow. The majority of the Blaze of Light were elves, dwarves, humans, and gnomes. Halflings were more likly to join the Blaze of Light since they were accepted by the worshipers of the light.<br>
<br>
Locked away ages ago, the demons have been seeking a way out. A way out of their hell hole. One day they found it. A little ray of light entered their volcanic underworld. A small passage was overlooked in the sealing of the demons. Now the demons have resurfaced, spreading their was of chaos, seeking revenge on all. The demons can never forget the hellish conditions they suffered the past few decades. Now the demon threat has returned and now with a new kinered flame of hate all of Nygard is at threat.<br>
<br>
Geography<br>
Even though Nygard was split between the opposing beleifs it did not have a split in the geography. Umbra's side was just as fertile as Lumos', and Lumos' side was just as disasterous as Umbra's. <br>
<br>
The dark domain contained the restless spirits. One of the main differences between Lumos' and Umbra's realm. Lumos' has the legendary Haunted Forests, where it is said that those who enter end up lost for all enternity, to die a slow and painful death.  There are the Blood Plains, where the biggest war was faught. This is the place Umbra and Lumos waged war in the creation of Nygard, and is sacred ground. However, the thousands that fell that day still live in the plains while not living. These are better known as zombies, and they are constantly fighting one another trapped in the battle that happened decades ago. Why the dead men have risen from their eternal slumber is unknown. Some say balckmagic is involved. The last and most notable is the Swamp of Terrors. People say the swamp itself is alive with evil, and reads the thoughts of those who enter and uses their greatest fear to bring the victims to their knees to be done away with. Only highly skilled mages with great focus are able to cross this treachorous swamp, but at the outskirts of the swamp live the trolls, orcs, and ogres each sperated into different tribes. They are forced to search far for food since the swamp provides nothing for them, but its the only place that they are not prosecuted against. Sometimes they even have to resort to canibalism, eating the ones who are old to let the young live on.<br>
<br>
The light domain is full of peaceful spirits. The Enchanted Forest, home to the elves, where it is said the trees themselves can come alive. The Enchanted Forest is protected by the very spirits of the forest protecting the forest from woodcutters and others who would destroy the land. Along the border between the two is Boulder Mountain. Boulder Mountain is actually connected with Hells Gate Mountain, but there are no passages that go all the way through to the other side. The dwarves live in the mountains and mine the caves to make homes and to gather materials to forge weapons and other needy items. It seems that all the caves seem to stop at the same spot. Despite the dwarves efforts part of the mountain can not be dug up not even by the strongest dwarf. It is guessed that this layer of rock is the seperator between the two mountains. Last is the Harvest Plains. These plains give bountiful harvest every year, and have been a main source of food. The humans and gnomes build cities near the plains and have created many kingdoms, each judged in power by the amount of the plains they control. War has often been thought as a means to gain more of the Harvest Plains, but some magic seems to overcome the warriors who go near it with ill intent. Being near the plains makes everyone forget about their troubles, and feel at peace. Many say that Umbra has blessed the land there himself.<br>
<br>
The demon rrealm<br>
The Hell's Gate Mountain range is where the demons were vanquised to. Now free many of the demons reside here killing anyone who dares to pass. At the bottom of the mountains the demons are weak, but the higher you go the tougher the demons get. It is said that at the top lives the demon god.<br>
<br>
Both the light and dark realms have been put to the test, waging war with the demons, and failing miserably. All those how oppose the demons die shortly after taking a few down. The time seems to have no heros left, yet an abundance of vilians. Or are the demons in the right of mind? Was their damnation wrong? Which side will you support? The light or dark realms both facing the demons with little success, or will you support the demons whose anciet prowless seems to push the demons onward to vengance and the destruction of the other races to fill the  blood lust developed through the years of solitude? <p>Don't fear that which you do not know I wont hurt you</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goergyboy>Goergyboy</A> at: 10/1/03 8:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goergyboy>Goergyboy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Immortal Sensei</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/3/03 4:14 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.euroasiasoftware.com/bilder/tiger.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> *It has been 10 years since the demons had escaped, and almost 10 years of constant war. The demons, once free, marched upon Nygard and waged war with all other races blaming them for their banishment. The demons have taking most of Nygrad leaving only small spots of resistance from the other races. At first the demons fought unorganized, but something changed that and the demons fought tactical battles, even cutting off communications between the other realms making an alliance impossible. <br>
The demons have already taken most of the land and if things continued the demons would have all of Nygard in no time at all. The only remain pockets of resistance were half of the Plains of Harvest, the Human kingdom of Grandale, the Long Arm dwarf clan, the Gnome kingdom Grownot, all of the Enchcanted forest, and all of the Swamp of Horrors.<br>
Mercinaries became in high demand, and bands of them would be sent to the feild to do battle. Many were just a bunch of people hoping to get rich, but those kind died in battle. There were experienced mercinaries, ones with outrageous prices. Even with such an outrageous price the other races gave their money to these mercinaries to help defend their kingdoms. All of the races besides the Elves, Orcs, Ogres, and Trolls have been forced to take the defensive and to hold out as long as they can. <br>
The city of Grandale is still highly populated and still has a some wealth. Any mercinaries wanting a job comes to Grandale. In the Gillbards Bar awaits all those seeking jobs. (I.E all players who aren't demon.)<br>
The demons of the realm feel that victory is assured and so push their offensive. Although relativly strong and now well organized, the demons can not get through the defenses. They still do not fight as one, the demons continue with their instincts to go into battle alone just now they are in large groups. Most demons are around the perimeter of the last places of resistance waiting for victory, others settle the large amounts of land conquered, claiming this as their home. (I.E all demon players get to start out anywhere, in a forest ,in a mountain, in the demon army. No demon or half demon can enter any of the cities of other races. I will be back late tonight so things may have a slow start, try meeting up with the other players if your not demon, or go your own way, demons may do as they please outside of taking over the city.) <p>Don't fear that which you do not know I wont hurt you</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=clockworkmist>Clockwork Mist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/3/03 9:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> ((might as well kick this off))<br>
<br>
Iyiro had his back turned to most of the crowd, with his foot propped up on the bar bench.  He was holding a racketed tin cup in his right hand, the gloved overcoating kept his hand from freezing from the cold lager.  <br>
<br>
His attire was more of a rangers form of dress, but one that would be from a more foreign land than this.  A large red trench coat looking garb which was open and revealing his chest, and a pair of black slacks were present.  His boot were thick, and meant for climbing which means he came from a mountainous region.<br>
<br>
His brown hair hung over his eyes, fencing his ice blue eyes as he watched upon the patrons of the tavern.  His glare was like a cold chill, but his voice was hardly equal to that of an angels.  <br>
<br>
He was here for one purpose and one purpose only, just to stop the demons that were infesting this world.  He was not one man to sit around while the evil plagued the land.  He was neither a man to take down the demon army by his lonesome, he needed help, perhaps he would find someone that may aid him in here.<br>
<br>
He took one long draw from his ale and set it down on the bar.  A low jingle of chains is heard from within the tavern.  A large sling of chainlinks drops from his sleeve and lands at his side, dangling and jingling, sending that rhythmatic ring into the tavern.  Anyone with proper ears could hear so.  He just waited now, for someone to pass him by.<br>
<br>

Reine was pacing in his room thinking of what he should do, what can be done with the demons that roam the grounds. At the moment they are able to stop their advance plunging the human world to nothingness. It was a terrible thing to happen, the last bastion humanity threatened by the evil that was unleashed. It was not only the human population that was in trouble, the other races were also in peril. <br>
<br>
With the number of monsters lurking the land, even their combined military cannot push the demons back. IT should be something else, soemthing to at least weaken the demons. <br>
<br>
Though the elves were able to hold the demons back without losing their territories. Whatever the reason is they were able to and he will have to find it out.<br>
<br>
He was able to gain permition to travel to the lands of the elves with everything that he needs. Stealth is the key so bringing the whole army is out of the question. He may ask for some few people but would not demand it from them. He has informed the soldiers under him that if they are willing to take the mission they are to meet in the gillbars bar. He was going to recruit more people in there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Gathering his thoughts, he went out of his room, through the corridors and out of the barracks. The people of the city are all braced to what might eventually be the end of all civilisation. Dread can be seen in their eyes, hope is almost lost. <br>
<br>
After some time walking, he came upon the building where he will meet the people that would join him. He went inside and saw that the bar was more lifeless, a reflection of their world. He then sat at one of the tables, the one that would be easily noticed by anyone. The news that he circulated a few days ago would draw the attnetion of anyone willing, he would just have to wait for them to arrive. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coolrain@goergyboysroleplayingpalace>coolrain</A> at: 10/3/03 6:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rfsanguinius>RF Sanguinius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/3/03 10:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> The Gillbars Bar door swung open, with the chill breeze of the night came rushing in.

He took a step into the room and glanced at the patrons, before proceeding the bar. He leaned over the bar and grabbed the bartender.<br>
Wispering he asked for elven wine before releasing the man. Grabing his drink he walked to an abbandoned booth in the dark corner. There he sat as if waiting for someone to turn up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coolrain@goergyboysroleplayingpalace>coolrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Regular</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/3/03 7:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.gamespy.com/avatars/av/MA/ma1486.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Looking around the place, reine noticed two patrons that may be interested in joining his mission, there is no point in hiding identity, the enemy is common, every race will perish, everyone would either be willing to help or point at someone who is able. Better make you purpose known.<br>
<br>
He gestured the to the two persons, the one who just came in and the one who has his feet up the bar. He silently waited for them to come over. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coolrain@goergyboysroleplayingpalace>coolrain</A> at: 10/3/03 7:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rfsanguinius>RF Sanguinius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/4/03 12:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> As he sat there drinking he continued to scan the room.

<br>
With skin as black as night, and piercing gray eyes he looked around the place. His features were human apart from the distinct elven ears. The only emotion shown was with the eyes, scarce as it was.<br>
<br>
Sitting down, he waited for the other to join them.

<br>
His eyes lowered a bit to the table, slipping into a pocket of deep thought.  His mind went blank for the longest time, and a small void of nothing appeared.  When he opened his eyes, he was in a distorted land, filled with demons all around him.  <br>
<br>
Instantly he shot up from his seat and pulled his Arullius from his pant leg, and shot it to the right.  In his mind he was in the distorted world, in the real world he had just slung a table into the wall.  His eyes were swirled in the real world, which was a common sign he was in his own world.  <br>
<br>
He screamed slinging his blade into the roof, the chains of the sword made it extend and wrap around a rafter.  He tore the blade down, scarring the wood and it came back to him, forming into the same sword.  Next he flailed around screaming, &quot;Get away from me!!  All of you demons get away!!!!!&quot;  Clearly in the real world he looked like a maniac, but his blade had scarred many as he was in his rage.  It didn't strike any in his group, but it did sling around and strike a bartender in the back of the neck, the blood spewed from the back as many patrons went to help him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rfsanguinius>RF Sanguinius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/4/03 9:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> During the panic caused by Iyiro, Thruldor decided to take his leave.

Reine was disappointed with the people that he met, they did not even have enough patience to wait, how would they be able to survive this journey.<br>
<br>
He stood up and shouted over the whole crowd, &quot; There is an expedition going to the land of the elves those who are willing to join you can come with me to the barracks and we'll brief you, if newcomers come in, inform them of it and meet us there. We will wait for an hour or two only, i have sent the news last week to meet here this day. Anyone who ask point them in that direction. He then walk outside and started walking back to the barracks. If he needs to he would pull people from his command.<br>
<br>
He arrived in the barracks and informed the the guardds to lusher those who are going to the expedition to the meeting hall. He himself went over and waited, hopefully good people will come. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coolrain@goergyboysroleplayingpalace>coolrain</A> at: 10/4/03 7:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goergyboy>Goergyboy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Immortal Sensei</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/4/03 11:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.euroasiasoftware.com/bilder/tiger.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> *The group of five tried to calm down Iyrio who just kept yelling about demons.

The 5 left to follow Reine while the guard took Iyiro into prison. Iyiro was screaming about demons the entire time, and when presented before the court they saw him mentally unstable, and decided that they would get rid of him by sending him out to attack the demons. The next day Reine was with the other 5 waiting for people to show. Just then a court messenger came and gave a court notice to Reine. It stated &quot;It is by the power invested in the court, power given by King Uther himself, has appointed you, Reine, to take Iyiro on your campaign.

<br>
Reine was aghast when he heard the compensation, a hundred gold for this trouble? He himself wouldn't give money that low to the mercenaries that would join him. He has to get more money. He would demand the cover of expenses that is needed in this travel, to buy supplies and other things needed.<br>
<br>
Reine went over to get the funds of the guards. Being strip of his command doesn't worry him, its the demons that does. He commanded to retrieve the supplies they needed and set it to the room where he will held the meeting. He also called for 5 most capable soldiers and a mage to join the expedition.<br>
<br>
He went into the meeting room and scanned 12 people of which 4 are soldiers, 6 other adventurers another mage and 1 lunatic. He then began his briefing, &quot; Gentlemen, we are going to an expedition to the elvenland, as you know, the races are falling in the hands of the demons. This is the last stronghold for us humans.&quot; Upon saying that, his heart ached of what has happened to the Kingdom of Aronia. The pain seen in his eyes.<br>
<br>
He continued, &quot; This is different with the elves, since the start of the invasion, they were able to hold all of their territories. What method they have done we do not know, but we do know that its knowledge is vital to our survival. Thus our mission. We will travel Northward avoiding as much confrontation as possible. We move with speed and stealth. Our mission will be supported by the kingdom as this is of vital importance to us all. Possibly the only chance we have. I expect you to carry out the mission or die trying to achieve it as death will be a reward with our failure. &quot; He looked deep within the eyes of each one, infusint them with purpose and will.<br>
<br>
&quot; If you have questions, ask it now before you lose your chance to permanently. If not we can start taking our supplies. &quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coolrain@goergyboysroleplayingpalace>coolrain</A> at: 10/4/03 8:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=clockworkmist>Clockwork Mist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/5/03 2:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> Returning from the court decision, Iyiro was still feeling very weak in the head.  His head was light and he could hardly pay attention to a word that Reine said.  He was not a lunatic, just schitzophrenic, a common case in most Psionic mastery, which was like psychics but creating foreign matter in instants.  <br>
<br>
Finally, after the breifing stopped, he felt half normal and his head didn't ring as much.  He stood looking at the people around him, wondering if each of them thought of him as a lunatic.  He didn't want them to, in fact he always tried to control it so people wouldn't hate him or be afraid of him.  <br>
<br>
His hand was still on Arullius but it was in sword form, somewhat ready for action.  He pressed a small button on the top of the grip, and the sword slowly detatched into several parts, hanging by one long steel cord which made it like a whip.  He finally spoke, &quot;I am ready...if I seem to act as a I did earlier, please throw some water on me, I'm usually in a dream state when I do such.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bgoergyboysroleplayingpalace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rfsanguinius>RF Sanguinius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fresh Meat</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#0000FF>(10/5/03 7:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crises of Nygard part 1- The Beginning of Legend</span><hr size=1> Thruldor stared at Iyiro, than turning to the mage.

<br>
*Pop's steps in*<br>
<br>
Pops: They could kill you that's what. Incase you forgot the demons have taken most of the land and slaughtered many. Your fighting spirit is strong but your mind is weak. If we attacked head first we'd be destroyed easily. I suggest that we go through the Harvest Plains in the night. It is in the other direction then our goal, but it is vital for feeding the races so it is well guarded. We should be able to get out of the city and get a safe distance from the demons if we leve from there. Also I know a man who could be of help in the gnome city of Grownot.

&quot; Have you not been listsening. &quot; Reine called out irritably, we are going to do this as much stealth as possible.&quot; Don't be so cocky about the demons i have survived what they can do just barely and see them killed some of the best men i know. &quot;<br>

&quot; It seems that you have no questions at all. Sad as i feel i can't change it. Well leave as soon as you guys get your supplies, they are  outside waiting for you.

Reiner returned after an hour, clad in his well fitted black leather armor with his twin blade on both sides of his hips. The armor was adorned by smaller throwing knives. He puled another garment a robe and put it over his armor. He then stared at his companions looking for signs of readiness.
