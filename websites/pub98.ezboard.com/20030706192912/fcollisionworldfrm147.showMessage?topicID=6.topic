The horsemen could not have left the forest for Mirak would have sensed the movement. The horsemen rather used a spell to hide himself meaning he wouldn't be able to move or he would be found.<br>
<br>
Mirak instantly dropped to the ground and waited for the others to arrive on their horses. &quot;Let’s hope we find him soon or I will have to call Zeroz&quot; Mirak thought as he waited for the others.<br>

Fuego galloped with amazing speed, over upgrowing roots and under low branches.  Kyonae held on tight to Menion's shoulders, peering through the rain at Ember's captor.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a white phantom leapt from the shadows and ran alongside the roan horse. It was a mare of brilliant white, saddleless, and tossing its head in the rain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nieva!&quot; <br>
<br>
Kyonae perched herself among Fuego's back and sprang suddenly from her place, flying through the air and grabbing hold of the gallant horse's neck.  She clutched at the mane of the elven steed and cried,<br>
<br>
&quot;Nieva latora, su kana na!&quot;<br>
<br>
Immediately the white mare sprang forward in magnificent speed, its hooves barely touching the ground.  She sprang ahead of both Menion and Naomi, following the robed Osirian and the shadow flying in the sky.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/2/03 12:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Search</span><hr size=1> Mirak turned his head as he felt the horsemen move. &quot;You should not have dared move&quot; Mirak remarked and teleported right next to Kyonae. <br>

As the horsemen slowed, their horses spooked and rearing in the air, tossing their beautiful heads in the black light of the explosion, she lifted both of her hands from Nieva's mane, and perched upon her back, keeping amazing balance on the elegant creature that moved so swiftly through the violent night like a sliver of holiness' sword through evil's chest.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Blizza!&quot;<br>
<br>
A bright blue wave of icy wind conjured at Kyonae's will, overcoming the rearing horses and throwing them to the ground heavily, knocking their riders off as well.  They all hurtled into the mud, covered in slimy earth and ice frost that bit into their skin and made them bleed as they tried to move.<br>
<br>
Ember tumbled out of the way when her captor dropped her, out of the way of the spell.  Menion galloped through and swept her up skillfully into his arms, circling around and meeting back with Nieva.  Kyonae leapt from her back and stood among the frostbitten soldiers, whose skins were turning blue as the magic took effect.<br>
<br>
Naomi dismounted Storm and gestured her staff widely at them, and immediately black ropes conjured from the air and swiftly bound all their wrists and ankles together.  The palominos, spooked, struggled up form the mud and galloped away riderless.<br>
<br>
Kyonae knelt down and grabbed one Osirian by the throat angrily.  She looked back at Menion and Ember.  &quot;Ember, are you all right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I'm fine,&quot; she assured cooly, though obviously still a little frazzled.  &quot;Sneaky little bastards.  I never even saw them coming.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because you're brainless,&quot; the Osirian who Kyonae held dared to hiss.  &quot;You're all brainless, you worthless scu--aagh!&quot; he choked as Kyonae's grip on his neck tightened tenfold, and she dug her knee into his chest, increasing pressure on his lungs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; she demanded.  &quot;What was your purpose here this night? Tell me, quickly now!&quot;<br>
<br>
Menion looked at Kyonae in surprise.  Normally she wasn't so aggressive.<br>
<br>
The Osirian choked.  &quot;Gah...we were...were ordered to capture one of the mages meeting at the Inn.  Any would do...agh!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; Kyonae demanded further, incresing pressure and forcing the man's head back into the mud.  <br>
<br>
&quot;To...to lead you...into...our...gah...trap...&quot;  the man's ice-chapped lips curved up in a sardonic smile.  &quot;In which we succeeded...&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly many shadows burst from the night, surrounding them all and closing in for the kill.   <br>

I wanna learn how to do that!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ember,&quot; Menion muttered warningly, nudging her in the ribs.  He looked to Kyonae.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What...I think...?&quot; Kyonae repeated.  She seemed a little reluctant.  Then her features hardened.  &quot;We attack.&quot;<br>
<br>
Naomi smiled. &quot;Right.&quot;  She waved her staff at one group of shadows, eyes glinting, and they instantly turned to stone, and then crumbled to dust.<br>
<br>
Ember started throwing fireballs from her fists, setting a few on fire.  &quot;Ha ha! Take that you bastards!&quot; she cackled.<br>
<br>
Kyonae closed her eyes slowly, looking a bit faint.  Suddenly she dropped to her knees, holding her head and trembling slightly.  Her teeth were gritted in pain, but her lips were mouthing words.<br>
<br>
Then all of a sudden, the soldiers that were attacking the barrier slowed.  They started choking on their own breath, dropping their swords as they clutched their throats.  In the lightning, they saw many more, but they were all doing the same thing.<br>
<br>
One soldier started coughing blood, followed by many others.  They all seemed to be suffering the same afflictions, though none of them were being attacked.<br>
<br>
Menion wanted to assist the ice mage, but had seen this before and knew better than to intervene. Kyonae moaned through clenched jaws as she continued the spell that caused her much pain, and suddenly she screamed,<br>
<br>
&quot;DIE!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Then, all of the soldiers, who had been suffering, choking and bleeding, dropped to the ground dead.<br>

&quot;It is obvious that these soldier are watching us but it is also clear that they attempt such foolish attacks and hope to win so their intelligence about us should not be to complete so I do not believe this attack was directly commanded by the Goddess since she would no doubt have done a better job.&quot;<br>
&quot;I suggest that we launch a direct attack on the one who had placed the order for this trap. At the very least we might be able to give us more room to breath if not to stop more such foolish attacks.&quot; <br>

She looked at Mirak apologetically, looking drained.  &quot;I know...it was foolish...I'm sorry...&quot; she gasped, her voice not strong enough to go any higher.  Suddenly her knees buckled beneath her, but this time, Menion was there to catch her.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's okay, Kyonae.  You did your best.&quot;  Menion shot a glare at the void demon but it was more out of worry for the mage than anger towards Mirak.  Ice mages, and elves in general were very skilled in healing and they thought nothing of bringing someone back from the edge of death.  It came as second nature for them.  But it took so much power for them to use death magic, (more Naomi's field than Kyonae's) that it always left them drained and weak.  Elves were never meant to harm, only to heal.  Dark elves were an exception.<br>
<br>
Kyonae staggered back and leaned into his grasp, trying to balance herself and failed.  Menion just sighed and picked her up, holding her effortlessly because she weighed so little.  &quot;so what do we do now? I agree with Mirak...attacking the leader of these guys seems to be the best option.  But how are we going to find out who it is?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have an idea,&quot; Naomi purred.  &quot;These soldiers are not of an independent faction.  They are from the Osiria Army.  See their badges?  Now King Jio certainly would not have the brains to send an attack, or the will, because he really cares nothing for us.&quot;  She shrugged.  &quot;It seems that maybe we should look for the commander of the army.  For years the King and the military have been at odds.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I say we just blast them all,&quot; Ember stated.  &quot;Just one good fire spell and BAM!  It's all over.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Ember,&quot; Menion shook his head.  &quot;We can't do that.  There are innocent lives at stake.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No Osirian is innocent,&quot; Ember spat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Neither is any Dratilian,&quot; Naomi shot back calmly.  Ember shut up immediately, looking guilty.  &quot;We'll find the commander of the army.  No doubt he--or she--is in hiding now.

<br>
Kyonae clung to Menion's shoulders as she drifted in and out of consciousness, listening to Naomi speak, her voice fading and focusing like a restless dream. Other voices echoed in her mind, and suddenly, the voices were not just memories...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(I want her alive.  Kill the others....actually, bring Eboncloud and Strife back as well.  I'd like to talk to them.  But do what you will with the rest...)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(Yes, Commander Kuja...we will bring them to you at the Temple of Firadra...we'll show those Dratilians...)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&quot;....Kuja.&quot;<br>
<br>
Menion and Naomi had been pondering meanwhile about where the commander would hide, when suddenly Kyonae blurted out that one word.  They looked at her in question.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that?&quot; Naomi asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Commander Kuja,&quot; she repeated.  &quot;Temple of Firadra...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, she is quite correct.&quot;<br>
<br>
They turned suddenly to the voice, and saw a man in blue robes riding up from down the path.  He had short whiteblond hair and steely greyblue eyes.  A spellbook was ctucked under his arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cedric!&quot; Menion cried joyfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heya, Menion,&quot; he waved, climbing down from his steed.  &quot;I missed ya! The minute I arrived at the Tavern, Mitzi told me you'd gone! What happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, nothing much,&quot; he shrugged, as his gaze went to Kyonae.  &quot;So, what did you mean, she's right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, she's quite right in believing that.&quot;  He cleared his throat matter of factly.  &quot;I've read up on things, and Kuja Dracolon is the current commander in Osiria.  And by what Kyonae has said, he's following a basic strategy plan used by the Lorelonians against Milonia in the Siren War.  He's taking the Temple as his base, and probably if he doesn't get what he wants, he'll...um...he'll destroy it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bullshit!&quot; Ember shouted.  &quot;There is no way in hell they're taking down THAT temple!  C'mon, Menion, we gotta go save it!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Calm down, Ember,&quot; Menion urged.  &quot;We don't even know where we are.  how are we supposed to find the Temple of Firadra?&quot;<br>

Mirak quickly summoned a portal. &quot;If memory serves the Temple of Firadra was busy being constructed when the Void Demons ruled this world so it should still be in the Unknown Regions?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh and one more thing who is this Eboncloud and Strife I heard the voices speak of?&quot; <br>

<br>
&quot;And Strife...that would be me,&quot; Menion guessed.  &quot;It has to be...I don't know what they'd want with Ember.&quot; Menion paused, his brow fringing.  &quot;What voices?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cedric looked at Menion meaningfully, silencing him and at the same time telling him silently that it was the matter of stronger mages and beings than himself.  &quot;Mirak is right.  During the Siren Wars, Void Demons were present about Mahtim, drawn by the evil. It is still there, in the Unknown Regions, shrouded by forest(OOC: You mean the Restng in Unknown Regions topic??? *slightly confused*).&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You had better prepare her,&quot; Naomi suggested, glancing at Kyonae, who trembled from the loss of energy, her face more pallid than usual and her half lidded eyes the color of cracked ice reflecting against the blue sky.  Her slender fingers clutched at Menion's red shirt, seeking warmth.  &quot;The journey, whether we ride, walk or teleport, will take a toll on her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay.&quot;  Menion carried her effortlessly over to Fuego who stood very patiently, and set Kyonae down only long enough to remove the blanket from his steed's back and wrap it around Kyonae's shoulders snugly.  Her skin was glacial; it was normal, but she was shaking as if cold and the remedy had worked before in previous situations.<br>
<br>
&quot;There you go, Kyonae,&quot; he said gently as he caught her back up in his arms.  &quot;Feeling okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tired...thank you.&quot;  She struggled against the weariness to look up at him.  &quot;That was so stupid of me,&quot; she said hoarsely.  &quot;Mirak was right...I shouldn't have...I just...&quot;<br>
<br>
Menion shushed her.  &quot;It's alright.  You did what you thought was best.&quot; He grinned, lowering his voice.  &quot;Besides, what does <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mirak</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> know?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes were pale and weary as she sighed shakily.  &quot;...A lot more than I do,&quot; she whispered, before she slipped out of consciousness, resting limply against the warmth of his chest.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Naomi talked to Mirak.  &quot;If we are to go now, we should go quickly.  Will be go by land, or by mind?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey!&quot; Ember cried, emerald eyes gleaming with wonder.  &quot;Are we going to be magicked to the Temple?&quot;<br>
<br>
Menion shot her a look.  &quot;Ember,&quot; he warned, scolding her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/7/03 5:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Search</span><hr size=1> (OOC: Well sorry for the confusion but I rather meant that we could place the temple in the 'Other Places in the World: Unknown Regions forum')<br>
<br>
Mirak looked at Kyonae and stepped over to her looking at her with all three eyes. &quot;The portal is created by Void Magic, which feeds of pure evil so it would most surely kill her in this state. I have a idea but I have not tried something like this in many years&quot; Mirak said and started casting a spell on Kyonae.<br>
&quot;Since I have no emotions I am neither good nor evil so I can use both magics but unfortunitly white magic is one of my weaker abilities.&quot; Mirak then finished the spell and Kyonae started to glow for a few seconds before it slowly faded.<br>
&quot;Hopefully the healing spell would have worked and she should be feeling good enough to use the portal if not we will need to go by land.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/7/03 5:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Search</span><hr size=1> Menion's face hardened as he came near, and held his hand over the elf's face.  He clutched the sleeping mage to his chest, who moaned softly from the motion. &quot;What are you doing to her?&quot; he cried in alarm.<br>
<br>
But he was held still in an invisible, vicelike grip as the spell took hold of Kyonae, making her pallid complexion glow.  Rather than dying or doing something horrid that poor Menion expected, her eyes fluttered and she breathed a sigh of relief, the trembling in her joints lessening, though not stopping, as the spell was not that great.  When the glow finally faded, Menion was able to move and he quickly reached to feel her lifebeat, and was surprised to find it beating swiftly beneath his fingers.  Her eyes were closed and her expression took on the face of one who has been lulled into a peaceful dream.<br>
<br>
He looked up at Mirak, guilt tugging down at the corners of his lips, but said nothing.  He nodded briefly in thanks and shifted Kyonae's almost non existing weight in his arms, and pulled her closer, walking off to talk to Cedric.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not mind him,&quot; Naomi purred, walking up from behind Mirak with an all knowing expression.  She leaned on the staff she bore and coughed into her hand.  &quot;He cares for her, Menion.  More than anyone else has cared, I'll wager.&quot;  She wiped her lips with a handkerchief, and stuffed the rag back into her robe pocket.  &quot;She is strong enough to travel now.  How ironic, it is...that the most powerful of souls are always trapped in the weakest mortal shells.&quot; <br>

What makes you think I know about love?&quot; her voice bittered slightly as her lips sneered.  &quot;Maybe love for the art of magic, of course, but never ::that:: kind of love.  &quot;I see it only in his eyes, and things he used to tell me.  Menion is not like you and I, Mirak, anymore than you are like me and I you.  He has this notion that love conquers all. Hah.  Show me one time in the universe when ::love:: has conquered all.&quot; She shook her head.  &quot;When he and I first met, he pounded that theory into my brain, until I could barely stand it.  But when it comes down to it, anything that has ever been conquered had been such by magic or physical force.  It was always the wand or the sword.  It was never the heart.&quot; She looked at them, and sighed wearily, pausing a bit to drink form her hip flask.  &quot;But Menion does not think that way.  He has his own beliefs, and who am I to squander them?<br>
<br>
&quot;And yes, I know Kyonae is in danger,&quot; Naomi nodded.  &quot;She looks very weak, yes? She is.  But only in that shell.  Within her, as within all of us, there is extraordinary power.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Well...guess there's no choice but to move on,&quot; Ember tried to say in a pained voice, but anyone could tell she was excited.  Magical things astonished her.  She skipped on through.<br>
<br>
&quot;My goodness.  A Portal!&quot; Cedric gasped, walking over and inspecting it wondrously.  &quot;Very skillfully made...what power!&quot; he commented to his approval.  But suddenly he was cut short as Ember's red cloaked hand shot out from the silvery void and grabbed him by the collar, pulling him in.<br>
<br>
Menion was left alone in the woods.  He patted Fuego's snout in goodbye, knowing the intelligent horse would have the sense to return to the inn, along with Nieva and Storm.  <br>
<br>
He looked at Kyonae warily.  So peacefully she slept, oblivious to everything.  So rarely did she have sleep like this.  And he had Mirak to thank.  He still didn't trust the void demon, especially his inability to feel emotion, but he had to accept him.  After all, Kyonae asked him to come along.  If she trusted him, Menion should at least try.<br>
<br>
Menion sighed and pressed his lips gently on Kyonae's pale forehead, and held her blanketed body close before taking a deep breath and steppign through the portal, to the Temple of Firadra.<br>
