<br>
Ten years.<br>
Twenty-five years old now, and a far cry from the girl she once was, Kat steps off the plane and walks through a now unfamiliar airport. She takes the sunglasses off her head – there’s no need for them, it’s raining in London. <br>
“Passport, ma’am.”<br>
Dutifully she hands it over, flipping her hair over her shoulder. Airport crew got cute, she thinks. He examines her closely, and she realises this passport is from when she had brown hair and eyes – the passport she used to leave all those years ago. Quickly she yanks it away from him, giving him the newer one, depicting a white-blonde-haired, grey-eyed woman.<br>
“Thank you. Please proceed to luggage pick up.”<br>
“Thanks.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Proceed here, proceed there. Don’t they know how to speak normally?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She wonders.<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Say go. Or move. Although then they’d sound like farmers.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
She shakes her head, disgusted with herself for thinking such stupid thoughts.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>It’s only so I don’t have to think about…nope. Not even gonna think it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Welcome back, me.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>CHAPTER ONE: HOMECOMING</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>welcome back to my dive<br>
welcome back to my little corner of hell<br>
welcome the way pain eats you alive</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I couldn’t return to Hogwarts – I’d finished school back home, on top of that, I was twenty-five. Couldn’t see that going over too well with teachers and students alike. <br>
“You lost, love?”<br>
I cringed at the sight before me. Some old trucker guy, standing there with a stupid grin, revealing over five missing teeth.<br>
“No, I’m fine. Thanks anyway.”<br>
I walked away as quickly as possible. <br>
Where do I start? Ten years have gone by, all too fast. I don’t know what has become of the people I once knew, because they never tried to contact me. Maybe something happened, maybe they thought I didn’t want reminders of a life that almost killed me. <br>
I suppose I knew I had to come back. Something’s up in the world I left behind, something that is threatening not just my loved ones, but Creation itself.<br>
                                                <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Da-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ad!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“Al-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>lie!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
I pouted. I hated acting liking a spoiled brat, but he just would not listen! The latest broomstick, part of the Stellar range, had come out, and I really, really, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>really</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wanted it.<br>
“I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that broomstick if I want a chance of making the team!”<br>
“First years can’t be on the team, you know that well enough.”<br>
“Uncle Harry-&quot;<br>
“-was the exception to the rule.”<br>
“Don’t you think I’m good enough?”<br>
He hugged me and bent down to my eye level.<br>
“Of course I do. I just don’t think you need the broomstick, that’s all.”<br>
“It’s not like we can’t afford it.”<br>
Dad sighed and straightened up. “This is exactly what I wanted to avoid. You are not getting that broomstick, end of story.” He entered another shop.<br>
“It’s my birthday before I leave!” I yelled after him, lying through my teeth. No reply. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Malfoy Manor? Why’d yer wanna go there?”<br>
“Why?” I panicked. “Did something happen?”<br>
“No, no. I was just wonderin’.”<br>
I’d found Diagon Alley, and was busy interrogating someone from Flourish and Botts. I figured, house that big, and the Malfoys being reasonably well known, someone had to know what was going on. <br>
“Do you know how I can get there?”<br>
“Well,” said the woman, scratching her head, “yer best bet is likely Floo powder. There’s a witch down Knockturn Alley. Give ’er five Galleons and she’ll get yer where yer need to go.”<br>
“Where’s Knockturn Alley?”<br>
She grumbled something under her breath and pointed the way. “Second shop on yer left.”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Five</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Galleons?” I said in disbelief. I didn’t have a lot of wizard money.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Delayed reaction.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I counted my money. Six Sickles, four Knuts…and thank God, five Galleons. I followed the directions the woman had given me, and nearly knocked over a little kid in the process.<br>
“Sorry,” I muttered sheepishly. She hadn’t even noticed and moved on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I watched as the lady moved down the street. She looked kind of like Aunt Aurora.<br>
“Hey, Dad?”<br>
“Mmm…”<br>
“Where’s Aunt Aurora now?”<br>
“You know,” he said, preoccupied with a spellbook. “Jesus, these things change…”<br>
“Dad,” I admonished. I know we’re not devout Christians and everything, but still. I suppose it’s just something from my muggle side.<br>
“Sorry…you know where Aurora is.”<br>
“Yeah, but wasn’t she moving?”<br>
“Oh, yes…she’s in Australia right now.”<br>
“Australia…wow.”<br>
“Maybe one day we’ll go there,” he said absentmindedly. “What else do you need?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“You seek to go somewhere. Madame Fleur knows all.”<br>
I stifled a laugh. Why else would I be in a wizard Floo travel agency called, of all things, Fly by Floo by Fleur?<br>
“Yeah. Malfoy Manor.”<br>
“It can be done. For a price.”<br>
“Right, the five Galleons. Here.”<br>
I heaped the coins on the dirty desk. She nodded gravely and took my hand. I winced as her nails dug into me.<br>
“There’s something about you, my dear. Such energy,” she murmured as she waved her free hand around my head. I pulled away.<br>
“Can I go now?”<br>
“Of course.”<br>
She led me to a fireplace and instructed me what to do. <br>
“Hasn’t changed,” I commented. “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Malfoy Manor!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Okay, can we go now? This is boring.”<br>
Dad paid for the books and we left the shop.<br>
“Draco? Is that you?”<br>
A woman’s voice reached us, and I felt, rather than saw, Dad cringe. <br>
“Keep moving, Allegra.”<br>
Spotting what could be a funny source of embarrassment for my dad, I stopped in my tracks. “Come on, Dad. She wants to talk to you.”<br>
Well. I didn’t know it was possible for a person to look so – <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>doglike</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Honestly. She was more pug than human. If I had a camera…priceless.<br>
“Pansy…er, hello there.”<br>
“Why, Draco Malfoy, you haven’t changed one bit, handsome devil!”<br>
“Ew.”<br>
Women who fawn over my dad as though he’s some kind of superstar scare me. ‘Handsome devil’? Come on.<br>
“What <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>have</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you been doing with yourself, and who is this child?”<br>
“This-&quot; Dad seemed to swell up a bit here, “-is my daughter, Allegra.”<br>
“She’s simply gorgeous, Draco, just lovely. And is there a Mrs. Malfoy?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Okay, self. Just a note: don’t travel by Floo ever!”<br>
I stood up and dusted myself off, taking in my surroundings. <br>
“Oh, no! Miss cannot be here! Miss is-&quot;<br>
“For the love of God, shut up,” I hissed. A house elf had entered the room and was busy flipping out. “Please! Am I at the Malfoy Manor?”<br>
“Master will return soon, Master Malfoy-&quot;<br>
“Alright. Thank you and goodbye.” I placed a hand on the elf’s back, propelling her out of the room. “And not one word to Master Malfoy.”<br>
I sat down on a nearby chair. After all this time…<br>
Would he still need me as he once did? <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Perhaps we can catch up another time,” Dad said hurriedly. He tried to push me along, and Pansy – Pugface waved cheerily. I burst out laughing.<br>
“Handsome devil! Dad! Was she your girl back at Hogwarts?”<br>
He stiffened, and I knew I’d said something wrong.<br>
“Let’s go home.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Place hadn’t changed. Draco must have had a perfect memory, or at least one better than mine. I mean, let’s face it, kidnapping does not allow you to take in your surroundings too well, but I had the distinct feeling this room had survived the “earthquake” that had killed so many, including Draco’s parents. <br>
“What the hell?” <br>
I stared at a painting on the wall.<br>
A painting of me. Whoops. It was his mother. False alarm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Ouch. I hate Apparating!”<br>
“Did you want to Floo it?”<br>
I grumbled. Technically, I’m not supposed to tag along when Dad Apparates. <br>
Then again, him and me aren’t fans of rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A bang. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Someone’s here.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I knew it was Draco, and the thought sent butterflies cascading into my stomach. Was I really doing the right thing? Maybe he had a whole other life now. Maybe he had a girlfriend, and kids-<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Allegra!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
What had become of Cho’s baby girl? She was an orphan, and it was supposed to our job to protect her, and I wasn’t there. <br>
“Lighten up, Dad, I was just kidding, I wasn’t gonna tell Mum nothing-&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I froze. Standing in our lounge was the woman from Diagon Alley. <br>
“Uh, hi.”<br>
“Allegra,” she breathed. I raised an eyebrow.<br>
“Look, lady, I’m not gonna sue you or anything for bumping into me, no scratches or anything, see?” <br>
I pulled up my pant legs so she could see. She nodded. <br>
“Allie, sweetheart? Who’s here?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Cho. That was the first thing I heard. Out of an eleven-year-old, I heard the voice of my long dead friend. I nearly burst into tears. <br>
Until Draco walked in.<br>
“Allie, sweetheart? Who’s here?”<br>
“Just this lady from Diagon Alley. But what are you doing here anyway?”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kat. God. Kat.<br>
No, just Kat,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I laughed uncomfortably. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Just…me.<br>
You can’t be here.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Excuse me? Why are you here?”<br>
“Allegra. Upstairs.”<br>
“Dad-&quot;<br>
“Now!”<br>
“But-&quot;<br>
“Allegra, you are going to march up those stairs and not move from your room until I tell you. Go!”<br>
I watched in surprise as she did just that. Anyone talked to me like that would’ve been six feet under in a matter of seconds.<br>
“Quite the little soldier.”<br>
“Don’t. You can’t do that, come in here and make random judgements on everyone.”<br>
“Draco, I…”<br>
“Stop! I don’t want to hear it!”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You can’t stop me from talking. I had to come back, Draco. Something’s going on. Something bad, you must be able to feel it. If I know all the way back in New Zealand, you do too.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
He shook his head. “Nothing bad is coming. Tell me why you’re really here.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Because something is about to happen! </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“I’m…I’m married. It’s too late for us.”<br>
I stepped forward and held his face in my hands. I had to reach up a way, and pull him down to my level. “Never too late for anything. You know that at least.”<br>
“What the hell is going on?”<br>
I turned. “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hermione?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
She stood there, with an indignant look on her face. That image of strength was ruined by her lower lip trembling, as though she was about to cry. It took me three seconds to register what was going on.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You married my best friend?<br>
You don’t know the full story.<br>
What, there’s more? Let me guess-you both tripped down the aisle and said ‘hey, look, a priest. I do’?<br>
You left! You left me, and we had a destiny that I covered on my own! Our fate became mine!<br>
Not yours alone! You had Hermione!<br>
But she’s not you.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Stunned, I ran out of words. Hermione barged between us.<br>
“Who the hell are you?”<br>
“Mione, it’s me, it’s Kat-&quot;<br>
“Kat?” She searched my eyes. I shrugged.<br>
“Hey. How’re you been the past ten years?”<br>
“What are you doing here?”<br>
“I don’t want to repeat myself. Can we sit?”<br>
Hermione took a seat next to Draco, possessively draping an arm around his waist. I couldn’t help it, but the first thing that came to mind was ‘is she SuperSlut now or something?’. I know it’s terrible.<br>
“Why are you here?” Hermione repeated. <br>
“The answer, my friends, is blowin’ in the wind. I think there’s something of the Big Bad variety headed your way.”<br>
“You came back for that? Didn’t think we could handle it?”<br>
“Hermione. Please. I know what you’re capable of, and it’s enough to send some running. But I thought you may need my help.”<br>
“Help? How could you help?” she snorted.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>If you love this woman you will get her away from me. <br>
Is that a threat?<br>
It’s a bloody promise. That’s not the Hermione I knew.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I crouched at the bottom of the stairs, listening carefully. Apparently, Dad knew the woman I’d smacked into in the alley. Mum did too-although she wasn’t all that happy about it. <br>
“Help? How could you help?”<br>
Silence fell, but the tension floated all the way up the stairs.<br>
“Hermione, let her talk.”<br>
“I’m sorry, but she comes back here, expecting everything to be the same? It’s not right.”<br>
I heard Mum’s footsteps get closer to me, and I took flight to my room.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, but she comes back here, expecting everything to be the same? It’s not right.”<br>
Hermione got up and left the room.<br>
“Does she hate me?”<br>
“She’s in shock. Like me.”<br>
“Shock does not suit you.”<br>
“Big Bad, eh?” he said, changing the subject.<br>
“Big, big, big, Big Bad. Can’t you feel it? Can’t Hermione? She’s got a knack for these things.”<br>
“Hermione doesn’t feel much of anything since…” he stopped, but his words hung heavily, ominously in the air, and I found myself dreading what would come next.<br>
“Since what?”<br>
“Ron died three years after you left, Kat.”<br>
“Wh-what?”<br>
He sighed, a pained look on his face. “He died at the end of our last year at Hogwarts. Harry and him took off in that bloody flying car, and it crashed. Ron was killed instantly.”<br>
“Harry-&quot;<br>
“Harry took off. Journey of self-discovery. Self-pity more like.”<br>
“Self-pity?” Harry was not the self-pitying type.<br>
“Harry was driving. He was drunk.”<br>
Horror filled me. <br>
“A year after Hermione and I got married.”<br>
“And Allegra?” Much as I was still hung up about Ron, I needed to know where she fit into the picture.<br>
“Hermione and I adopted her. The Diggorys had her until we finished school. I took her, raised her on my own, then Hermione came and it seemed like a natural thing to do.”<br>
“Does she know…”<br>
“No.”<br>
There was a tone of finality in his voice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Mum? Who’s that lady downstairs?”<br>
“A old friend of mine and your father’s, dear. Nothing to concern yourself with. Now, did your hopeless dad take you shopping?”<br>
I smiled brightly. “Yup. We got books, and a wand, and a cauldron, and a set of scales, and-&quot;<br>
“Show me,” she said, taking my hand, and I gladly obliged. She looked sort of like she’d been crying.<br>

“What do you know about this evil?” <br>
“Know? More educated guess. Something big is coming Draco, and past years are going to seem like cake after what it will put us through. This evil is ready to devour the world.<br>
“And trust me on this one. This year’s Bad is not a fan of easy death.”<br>
He simply stared at me.<br>
“On the up,” I added weakly, trying to work up a tiny smile, “Check out the Homecoming Queen, huh.”<br>

“So, you knew Mum and Dad from Hogwarts? And Uncle Harry?”<br>
“Sure did.”<br>
“What were they like? Were they really bad? Did they listen in class?”<br>
“Hm…your mum was good and listened, your dad was bad and didn’t.”<br>
I laughed. Sounded about right. Mum always complained about men-Dad in particular-never listening.<br>
“Harry was a bit different. He was generally pretty good, but he had a habit of drifting off.”<br>
Kat had been at our house for three days, and I was leaving in two. I was determined to make the most of my time with her. She was just so cool. I mean, she was the same age as my parents, but she just seemed so much more in touch with everything. <br>
“Are you nervous about going away to Hogwarts?”<br>
“Me? Nah. I got Dad’s no fear gene.”<br>
“Lucky thing. I was terrified. On top of having lived on the other side of the world, I came from a completely muggle family. No magic whatsoever. Of course I found out that was reasonably common, so not a big deal.”<br>
“I’m part muggle you know. On Mum’s side.”<br>
She grinned at that. “Yeah. I know.”<br>
I continued packing away robes and clothes. “People are a lot more accepting now than they used to be…”<br>
“You’re smart for an eleven-year-old.”<br>
I shrugged modestly. “They say I’m precocious.”<br>
“That you are!”<br>
She moved to my bedside table and picked up a framed photo.<br>
“Who’s this?”<br>
“Who?” I stopped for a second to see. “Oh. That’s Uncle Harry.”<br>
“What?”<br>
“Uh hm, yeah, that’s him. That was his first ever professional game, against Bulgaria, He plays for France. Bulgaria went down 370 to zip. It was the most amazing game I’d ever seen.”<br>
“Harry plays professional Quidditch?”<br>
“Yeah. Since two years ago.”<br>
“Still Seeker?”<br>
“Oh, yeah. They treat him like he’s the Second Coming or something.”<br>
“It’s a get-in-his-pants…never mind.”<br>
I looked at her curiosly. “What?”<br>
“Nothing,” she said quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I trudged up the stairs, worn out. I’d been sparring Mr. Puffy in their home gym (Allegra named the punching bag).<br>
“Going to bed?” Hermione asked casually, leaning against the banister of the stairs.<br>
“Yeah. Night.”<br>
“Night.”<br>
I felt her eyes on me as I entered my room and shut the door firmly behind me. I kind of wished it had a lock. I did not fancy getting murdered in my sleep by Hermione.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Good night, Draco.<br>
Night.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I was not flirting! Married man! Married! <br>
Married to my old best friend.<br>
“Get over it,” I muttered. <br>
I have got to stop these conversations with myself.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Kat?” I knocked softly on the door. “Breakfast…”<br>
“I’m up!” came the muffled reply. “I’m coming!”<br>
I nodded.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Idiot. She can’t see you!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Okay!”<br>
I slid down the banister and raced into the kitchen, where Mum and Dad were being served by Emelas, our house elf. <br>
“Allegra. Sit down and don’t run.”<br>
I sat down.<br>
“Hey, waffles!”<br>
“Eat.”<br>
I happily stuffed my face, and Kat walked in and sat down.<br>
“Waffles!”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“So, Draco,” I said in between bites. “You never did tell me what happened to your delightful cousins.”<br>
He shot a panicked look at Hermione, who looked away.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Aurora</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is in Australia.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And for Allegra’s sake, don’t mention Aphrodesia.<br>
Why?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
He groaned.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Do I have to tell you over breakfast?<br>
Tell me later.<br>
Alright. But you won’t like it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Australia. Nice place. Pass on the snakes and bugs though.”<br>
“Baby,” Allegra jeered.<br>
“Don’t talk with your mouth full.”<br>
She promptly closed it.<br>
“What time will we need to leave tomorrow?” I wanted to know.<br>
“For what?”<br>
“To take Allegra to Platform Nine and Three Quarters, for one. After that, I don’t care.”<br>
Hermione raised an eyebrow. “You’re coming?”<br>
“Of course!”<br>
“I’ll wake you up!” Allegra offered. <br>
“As long as it’s after the sun wakes up I don’t mind.”<br>
“So, five?” she grinned.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I still had packing to do, so straight after breakfast I was back into it. I took a break for lunch and dinner, and after Kat came in to see me.<br>
“Spellbooks,” she moaned. “Oh, boy, did I hate these things. They didn’t contain anything useful, like how to hex someone’s nose off.”<br>
“That’s what this is for.”<br>
I pulled out a box from under my bed, and showed her my books.<br>
“I’ve been collecting these since I was eight. Every time we went to Diagon Alley I would buy one. My parents don’t know.”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Horrible Hexes, How To Curse Your Friends and Family,  Jelly-Legs Jelly-Nose and Other Handy Jelly Jinxes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->…quite a collection.”<br>
“I know how to do every one in all these books,” I told her proudly.<br>
“What poor dog did you practice on?”<br>
I started laughing, and she looked puzzled. “You’ve met Mr. Puffy already, right?”<br>
“Yes…”<br>
I couldn’t contain myself any longer. “Well, Mr. Puffy used to be Mr. Vandelay, the mailman.”<br>
“Allegra! Did you…did you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>turn someone into a punching bag?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I couldn’t believe what I’d just heard. <br>
“Allegra! Did you…did you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>turn someone into a punching bag?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Her face fell. “Is that wrong?”<br>
“Yes! A thousand gallons of yes! Allegra, you turned a human being into something else without their permission! That is very wrong! Do your parents know?”<br>
“He was an evil man! He tortured puppies! I saw him!” <br>
“Allegra, that doesn’t make it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>right</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. I’ve got half a mind to tell your parents.”<br>
“No!” She panicked then. “Don’t!”<br>
“Let Mr. Puff- Mr Vandelay go!”<br>
“But-but-he’ll tell on me!”<br>
“We’ll make sure he doesn’t. Allegra, it is very important that you put this guy back the way he was.”<br>
“Why?”<br>
“Because what you’ve done to him is wrong!”<br>
“Alright, alright,” she said grumpily. “I’ll change him back.”<br>
I waited for her to move. “Now, Allegra.”<br>
“Yeah, yeah…”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Allegra</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
We went down to the gym, me armed with my wand, protesting all the way.<br>
“He’s evil, I’m telling you. Eeee-vel. Lots of e’s. He tortures puppies. Do you know what he did to one? He stuck-&quot;<br>
“I don’t want to know. I don’t have a puppy. We can skip it.”<br>
“He’s still evil.”<br>
“Doesn’t change much.”<br>
“Do I have to change him back?”<br>
“Yah-uh.”<br>
I looked up the countercurse. “Here it is…oh, hey! How to turn punching bags into flan! Everyone loves flan!”<br>
“Allegra…”<br>
“I know. It’s wrong. And flan’s too wobbly for my taste anyway.”<br>
Sighing, I pointed my wand at Mr. Puffy. “I really loved this punching bag. Here goes…<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>kwardverbag!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“Sheesh. These spells get more and more ridiculous as time goes on. It’s like they just lumped words together, and hey presto, instant curse. Or countercurse.”<br>
A frightened Mr. Vandelay cowered on the floor and I couldn’t help but smile as Kat towered over him.<br>
“I hear you torture puppies…” she leaned in close. “I’ll tell you something. I don’t have a puppy. I never liked dogs…but you even touch a puppy, or something remotely furry, she-&quot; she gestured to me, and I waved. “-will take a sick pleasure in turning you back into Mr. Puffy. Hear me?”<br>
“You-you don’t scare me!”<br>
“The stain on your pants says the opposite.”<br>
“Aw, gross!” I yelled. “It’s gonna smell like pee in here now!”<br>
“Can you Apparate?”<br>
He nodded and pulled a wand out of his back pocket. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allegra, I cannot stress enough how truly bad that was. If you think he’s evil, what you did was worse.”<br>
“I want to sleep now,” she replied stiffly. <br>
“It’s seven o’clock.”<br>
“I need to get up early tomorrow.”<br>
I took the hint and left, reminding her to wake me up. She waved me away.<br>
“Goodnight, sweetheart,” I said softly after she closed the door. Draco came toward me.<br>
“She asleep?”<br>
“Going to.”<br>
“It’s seven o’clock.”<br>
“Been there, told her that. She’s probably just wanting tomorrow to come faster or something.”<br>
“Guess so.”<br>
“You never did tell me about Aurora.”<br>
“Come on. We’ll go outside.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Outside? How come?<br>
I grabbed Uncle Harry’s invisibility cloak from my curse box. Mum and Dad didn’t know he’d given it to me. I waited until their footsteps faded away and slipped outside after them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“I don’t think I’ll ever have a garden this pretty,” I said, breathing in the flowers’ scents.<br>
“Gardeners. They do wonders.”<br>
A twig crunched behind us, and Draco whipped around.<br>
“Twitchy little ferret, hmm?”<br>
“Shut up.”<br>
There was affection, but seriousness in his voice.<br>
“So what’s up with Aurora and Desia?”<br>
“We should sit.”<br>
We did.<br>
“Spill. What’s the scandal?”<br>
“Scandal. One way to describe the lot, I suppose.”<br>
“You’ve got me intrigued.”<br>
“Aphrodesia and Harry started dating in our sixth year…”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I hit the ground when Dad turned around, even though I knew he couldn’t see me. I was loving being outside, and started running around, making sure to keep my cloak wrapped around me.<br>
“Aphrodesia and Harry started dating in our sixth year.”<br>
I came to an abrupt stop and sat down on the grass. I was getting a damp butt, but it would be worth it…<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“I thought Aphrodesia hated us all.”<br>
“No, that was Aurora.”<br>
“Huh.”<br>
“Harry asked her, and they were together right through until…well, Aurora didn’t like Harry-”<br>
“Knew that.”<br>
“Stop interrupting!”<br>
“Sorry.”<br>
“Aurora didn’t like Harry and Aphrodesia together. She actually confessed to a friend of hers that she had a bit of a crush on Harry. She couldn’t see what Desia had that she didn’t.”<br>
“Besides a heart?”<br>
“Shush! After we graduated from Hogwarts, Aurora went strange. She was almost obsessed with Harry. We all picked it up. She was admitted to St. Mungo’s more than once for her psychosis.”<br>
“God. Always knew that girl was a psycho.”<br>
He ignored me and continued. “She’s also a great actor. They let her go with a clean bill of mental health. We don’t know exactly what happened the night Ron was killed-it was the same night we finished school-and it turned out it wasn’t actually all Harry’s fault, even though he was drunk and driving. Aurora finally crossed over. She tailed them that night, to the Three Broomsticks.<br>
“Harry and Ron were drinking of course, living up the fact that they were now free. Eighteen-year-olds and freedom,” he said in disgust. “Anyway. They were doing something-playing some game-and they weren’t paying attention to their drinks. Aurora has an invisibility cloak-&quot;<br>
“Convenient. A little too-&quot;<br>
“Investigation’s over, Nancy. She came in and spiked Harry’s drink, knowing he’d drive, because he always did. And when they left, she followed.”<br>
“Wouldn’t they have seen a car behind them?”<br>
“On a broom.”<br>
“Of course.”<br>
“The potion she’d put in Harry’s drink was a sleeping agent. Harry fell asleep at the wheel, and the car crashed.”<br>
“She wanted to kill Harry, but she got the wrong one,” I realised. “Then what?”<br>
“Some things happened,” he said carefully. “But Aphrodesia and Harry remained together, as much as Aurora tried to split them up. She did every trick in the book.”<br>
“Soap opera queen that she is.”<br>
“Yes. Until Aurora found the perfect way to keep them apart.”<br>
“She <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>didn’t.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
He nodded sadly. “She did.”<br>
“She-she killed her own sister?”<br>
“Avada Kedavra.”<br>
“You’re <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>joking.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“I most certainly am not.”<br>
“Where is she?”<br>
“Take a guess.”<br>
“Azkaban.”<br>
“Murderers always make a mistake. Hers was gloating. She told Pansy Parkinson about it, and even though she’s not the epitome of decency, she finally got something right and went to the authorities. Two counts of murder, life sentence. She used an Unforgivable Curse.”<br>
“Why do you tell Allegra she’s in Australia?”<br>
“Australia used to be home to thousands of convicts-rapists, thieves, murderers,” he said with an ironic smile.<br>
“But why do you lie to her?”<br>
From nowhere, Allegra stood up in front of us, tears streaking her face.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Yes, tell us, why do you lie to me?”<br>
I couldn’t believe it, and was ready to scream.<br>
“Draco? Are you out here? I can’t find - Allie.”<br>
Mum spotted me and came over. “What are you three doing?”<br>
“I don’t know, Mum. Maybe they’re lying to me!”<br>
She looked over to Dad and Kat. “What are you doing?”<br>
“She’s in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Azkaban!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> All those times, she’s in France, she’s in Belgium, she’s in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Australia</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, it was a lie? My aunt is a murderer and you never thought to tell me?”<br>
My heart threatened to break out of my chest, but I tried to calm down.<br>
“Sweetheart-&quot;<br>
“No. Don’t talk to me.”<br>
I ran away, dropping my cloak and not even caring.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Hermione watched sadly as Allegra ran away, then stooped to pick up her abandoned cloak. “I could kill Harry,” she said quietly. <br>
“It’s not his fault,” Draco assured her. He got up and embraced her. I couldn’t watch.<br>
“She’ll be fine,” he muttered. “She’s a tough one, our kid.”<br>
Their kid.<br>
Their family.<br>
Their life.<br>
It was my turn to run for the house. I finally knew that this was not the same time, not even the same place. <br>
Time had not stood still for me, just as Lucius Malfoy had told me all those years ago.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>truth is beauty,<br>
and beauty is truth,<br>
that is ye know;<br>
and all ye need to know.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I lay awake in bed, and I thought I heard Allegra sobbing. I swung out of bed and placed my feet on the floor, debating on whether or not I should go see her. I checked the time. 3.04. Damn! <br>
Deciding that she was definitely crying, I pulled on a robe and went to see her.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I could hear footsteps coming towards my room and quickly shoved my head under the blankets. There was a gentle rapping on the door.<br>
“Allie? It’s Kat. Can I come in?”<br>
I heard the door open.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allie? It’s Kat. Can I come in?”<br>
When I didn’t get an answer, I slipped in anyway. “Allie, talk to me. I know you’re awake. I used to do the same thing to my parents.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Yeah, and they’d drag out me kicking and screaming, then throw me across the room to shut me up.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I pushed the unpleasant memory away and sat down on the bed.<br>
“Talk.” I poked the lump in the blanket. “Or I tickle. And I tell you, I was a tickling champion. I can go for days. Waits for laugh,” I joked. “Okay. So I’ll just sit here until you decide to talk.”<br>
That got her out. Her hair was a mess and her cheeks were tear-streaked. I took my opportunity.<br>
“Why are you so upset about this? Your parents lied to protect you. How can you mad with them for caring about you that much?”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Lying<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> is not caring,” she sniffled. <br>
“It is when it’s done to protect someone from something that could hurt them. Think about it. How would you feel, having to keep a secret as big as this from everyone?”<br>
She paused. “It would be hard.”<br>
“Very much so. Are you seeing it from my point of view?”<br>
“Kind of.”<br>
“I’m sure your parents will answer any questions you might have truthfully now.”<br>
Blinking back more tears, she asked me something I don’t think I’ll ever quite forget. “How soon is now?”<br>
How soon indeed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
After Kat left, I felt marginally better. I still didn’t know who Aphrodesia was, but I was determined to find out. Of course, I was leaving tomorrow, no today, so that didn’t leave a lot of time. I figured that Mum and Dad would be on such a guilt trip, I could talk them into telling me anything I wanted to know. Maybe that’s taking advantage, but when you find out your parents have lied to you since you were five I think you’re entitled.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Is she alright?<br>
Oh, God! Don’t do that! You don’t just sneak up on someone in a dark hallway! You stomp or bang or…yodel!<br>

She’s…dealing. You struck an out here, Draco.<br>
I know. We’ll make it up to her.<br>

Please, I prayed, please. Please say no. Tell me you’ll give it all up. Give it another chance. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I think I do. <br>
You don’t sound so sure.<br>
I was…<br>
But then I showed up?<br>
But then you showed up, and now…<br>
How soon is now? </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->I parroted Allegra’s phrase at him wearily.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What?<br>
Never mind.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Despite last night, I bounced up two hours after Kat had come to see me. I did everything I had to do then ran around like a madman waking everyone up.<br>
“Get up! Get up! I wanna go! Get up!” I pounded on Kat’s door, then ran to my parents’ room and leapt onto the bed.<br>
“Wake up…”<br>
Mum mumbled something. I yanked the pillow from under her head and threw at Dad. He flew up in bed. Satisfied I’d done my job, I lugged my trunk down the stairs. It’s so fun to ride things down the stairs-my bed, the banister, my trunk…<br>
“Emelas!”<br>
“Miss?”<br>
“Could you possibly make my parents get up?”<br>
“Emelas would be honoured!”<br>
The elf snapped her fingers and a pot appeared. I covered my ears as she ran up the stairs screaming like a banshee.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Owww,” I moaned. “Stupid banshee. Wait…”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Banshee?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I poked my head out the door. There, banging on a pot and shrieking her head off, was the Malfoy house elf.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Shut up!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
She ignored me and continued up the hall. I saw Draco stick his head out, still half asleep.<br>
“Emelas…” he thundered. I think that was the first time since I’d come back that I’d seen Lucius in him. <br>
“Leave it and come back to bed…” Hermione called. <br>
“Ugh. Pass the bucket,” I muttered. <br>
“Allegra needs to be dropped off…”<br>
“In two and a half hours.”<br>
He sighed and disappeared. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>If I hear moaning,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I thought to myself as I hopped back into bed, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I will turn them both into Mr. Puffies and damn the consequences.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Emelas, where is everyone?” <br>
It was seven o’clock and I was getting antsy. We had to leave in half an hour!<br>
“Everyone is upstairs, Miss Granger-Malfoy.”<br>
“Mouthful,” Kat yawned. She was dressed, at least.<br>
“Can you drive?”<br>
She looked surprised. “Can I drive? Technically, yes.”<br>
“Technically?”<br>
“I can drive. Not well. But I can.”<br>
I tried not to let disappointment show. “Well, if Mum and Dad don’t-&quot;<br>
“We’re right here, dear,” Mum said. Dad appeared next to her, arm around her waist. <br>
“Come on! I have to go!”<br>
“Half an hour, sweetie. In half an hour. Calm down.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You never told me her last name was Granger-Malfoy.<br>
Should I have?<br>
Yes!<br>
It’s natural.<br>
You’re married. Shouldn’t it just be Malfoy?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
He looked over to Hermione with an affectionate grin.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You know Hermione – totally independent.<br>
Spare me.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Breakfast. Shove. Don’t choke.”<br>
Allegra pointed to the plates of toast in front of us. I was starving.<br>
“Hogwarts. Seems so far away.”<br>
“Only an owl away.”<br>
“Know anyone else going this year?”<br>
“Fred’s son, for one,” Hermione broke in. “Aiden.”<br>
“Fred has a son? Who with?”<br>
“Angelina. Remember her?”<br>
“Pretty one? Played Quidditch?”<br>
“Yeah.”<br>
“Oh, wow! That’s so cool. Let me guess though-red head?”<br>
“Oh, yeah.”<br>
“Anybody else?”<br>
“Well,” Hermione mused, pausing to think, “Oliver Wood has a daughter who’d be about entrance age. Zeanna, I think her name is.”<br>
“Marcus Flint’s boy,” Draco added. I pulled a face.<br>
“Is he rabbit-toothed like his father?”<br>
“Haven’t even seen him, just heard it around.”<br>
“Come on, I want to go sometime today!”<br>
Allegra was bouncing around on a complete high.<br>
“Did you have a sugar cereal for breakfast?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Finally, finally, finally they all finished and we were in the car.<br>
“Excited?”<br>
“I think I’m gonna explode!”<br>
“Please don’t. It’s too early.”<br>
It seemed to take an age to get to the station. Mum and Kat barely talked and Dad just focused on driving. The tension was flying. When we did get there though, I burst out of the car and ran to the barrier. Mum had told me exactly where it was, and sure enough, there were people disappearing through it.<br>
“Is that little Allegra?”<br>
Behind me was a man with red hair and laughing eyes. <br>
“Fred!”<br>
“Hello, love. Where’re your parents?”<br>
“They’re coming. Hi, Aiden…”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We lagged behind Allegra, mainly because she’d left us to deal with her two trunks.<br>
“Is that Fred?”<br>
Hermione smiled and waved to a guy standing with a little boy and Allegra. He waved back.<br>
“Hi, Mione.”<br>
Draco stuck out his hand and Fred reluctantly took it.<br>
“Weasley.”<br>
“Malfoy.”<br>
Fred peered past Draco and saw me there. I shifted uncomfortably.<br>
“Who’s this?”<br>
Draco pulled me forward by my wrist, like a child. “You remember Kat?”<br>
“Kat? Can’t be…”<br>
“Sure is,” I replied. “How are you going?”<br>
“Same old, same old,” he said. “Joke shop’s doing rather well, what with Halloween coming up soon.”<br>
That got me grinning. “You own a joke shop?”<br>
“Co. But I’m running it while George is away.”<br>
“Where is he?”<br>
“He’s a professional Beater for England.”<br>
Impressed, I continued, “And what’s this I hear about you and Angelina?”<br>
A pink tinge came over his cheeks. “We have a son, Aiden.”<br>
I felt my heart break a little when I saw him – he was a carbon copy of Ron at that age. Fred picked up on what I was feeling.<br>
“I know who you see in him,” he said sadly. “We all do.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“I know who you see in him. We all do.”<br>
Aiden watched as Fred talked to Kat.<br>
“Who’s that?”<br>
“She went to Hogwarts.”<br>
“Oh. Are you ready?”<br>
“Are you kidding? Since two weeks ago!”<br>
He looked at me doubtfully.<br>
“Okay, yesterday.”<br>
“Dad says it’ll be great. He says it’s because Snape isn’t there any more.”<br>
“My dad says that’s a big loss to the school.”<br>
Aiden shook his head disdainfully. “What house do you want to be in?”<br>
I shrugged. “Any, I suppose.”<br>
“Gryffindor for me. All my family’s been in Gryffindor…”<br>
He launched into some speech about his genealogy.<br>
“Aiden,” I interrupted, “I really don’t care. Let’s go through.”<br>
I waved Mum and Dad over. “Can we go over now?”<br>
“I don’t see why not.”<br>
One by one we crossed over to the other side. Aiden tripped and fell on his face.<br>
“Whoa…” I was stunned. A steaming scarlet train hummed before us, and there were already people on board, not to mention the tonnes of crying parents farewelling their babies.<br>
My mother joined them.<br>
“Mum, please don’t cry - &quot;  <br>
“I can’t help it,” she wailed. “You’re growing up so fast, and I’m not going to see you for so long…”<br>
Dad laid a hand on her arm. “It’s alright. She’ll write all the time, and she’ll be home for the holidays.”<br>
Mum and Dad both hugged me, and Dad whispered in my ear, “If there’s one thing you do at Hogwarts, make it writing to your mother every day, and we’ll see what we can do about that broom.”<br>
Finally, I stood before Kat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We both just stood there awkwardly, not looking at each other. Finally, she threw her arms around my waist and I hugged her back.<br>
“Now,” I whispered to her.<br>
“What?”<br>
“You asked how soon is now. Now is now.”<br>
She clung to me tighter. “I’ll miss you. Will you still be here when I come back for Christmas?”<br>
“Perhaps. But I’ll write you, okay?”<br>
“Yeah.”<br>
We straightened up.<br>
“Dad?”<br>
“Hm?”<br>
“Who’s Aphrodesia?”<br>
Anger flitted across his face – no doubt at me – but he replied, “She was Aurora’s twin sister. My cousin.”<br>
Allegra didn’t push it any further.<br>
“Well…shouldn’t you go?” Hermione said reluctantly. “Looks like they’ll be leaving soon.”<br>
“Okay…”<br>
Aiden and Allegra boarded the train together, and waved to us from the window. Angelina had joined Fred, Draco, Hermione and myself by now, and was waving merrily to her son.<br>
“Bye! Have fun!”<br>
“Watch out for three headed dogs!”<br>
“And SongLand!”<br>
“And rogue Bludgers!”<br>
“Listen to your teachers!”<br>
“But not to evil people!”<br>
The pair looked at each other, then at us, a mixture of confusion and apprehension on their faces.<br>
“Uh…right. Sure. Three headed dogs, SongLand, rogue Bludgers, and evil people. Got it,” Allegra said, ticking off the list on her fingers. “Now buh-bye!”<br>
“Get on with your lives!” Aiden added. <br>
“Don’t forget my toilet seat!” Fred shouted as the train started pulling away. Angelina whacked him on the arm. Aiden nodded and pulled his head back inside. The train went faster, gathering steam.<br>
“Bye, baby!” Hermione said, sobbing. “Bye! Learn and have fun!”<br>
“A fun education,” I snorted. “That’ll be the day.”<br>
Allegra’s head appeared again, and she blew a piece of paper our way. I stretched my hand out and caught it.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You were right. Now was now.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I smiled.<br>
“She’ll be fine.”<br>
<br>

I bit my lip as I scribbled a quick note to Kat. I blew it out the window and fell back onto the seat.<br>
“They’re so…” Aiden couldn’t finish his sentence.<br>
“Protective. Worrisome.”<br>
“Worrisome? Is that even a word?”<br>
“Don’t doubt the smart one,” I replied. <br>
“Smart? You? Please. I’ve met ants with more brain cells.”<br>
“Ants have brains?”<br>
We stopped fighting and looked up. Standing there grinning at us were a boy and a girl.<br>
“Zeanna Wood,” she said importantly, sticking out her hand. Aiden looked at me as if to say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>who is she kidding?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. I shook her hand.<br>
“You’re Oliver Wood’s daughter?”<br>
“Yes. How did you know?”<br>

“Who are you?”<br>
“Allegra Granger-Malfoy.”<br>
“Aiden Weasley.”<br>
“Josiah Dayo,” said the guy with a goofy smile. <br>
“So, are you first years?” Zeanna asked.<br>
“No, second,” I lied, to see if she’d believe me. I nudged Aiden.<br>
“Yeah, me too.”<br>
“Liars,” she dismissed. “You don’t look it.”<br>
“I look very young for my age!” I protested. <br>
“Uh huh. Anyway, have you seen that totally cute biscuit hanging around?” <br>
“Um…biscuit?”<br>
She sighed. “Boy, stupid.”<br>
“Biscuit boy? There’s a human cookie walking around?”<br>
“Come on. I see there’s no time to waste. Don’t you go into the muggle world ever?”<br>
Aiden had heard the word ‘boy’ and immediately started talking Quidditch with Josiah. Zeanna pulled me impatiently to her side of the compartment.<br>
“I don’t know his name,” she said so quietly that I had to strain to hear her. “But he’s so cute, you should see him.” She brightened. “Ohh…idea. Come with me, we’ll go find him!”<br>
“What? I don’t know…”<br>
“Sure you do. Let’s go.”<br>
I shot a desperate look to Aiden, but he and Josiah were engrossed in their conversation. Zeanna pulled me out the door.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The only sound in the car was the engine running. Not one of us talked. I just sat up in the backseat, feet on the seat, head against the window, staring at the endless countryside.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Do you want to visit Ron’s grave?<br>
That came out of nowhere, but yeah, of course.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
He nodded and rounded a corner. Convenient. <br>
“Where are you going?” Hermione asked. I heard panic rise in her voice.<br>
“Cemetery.”<br>
“Draco…”<br>
“It’s been long enough, Mione.”<br>
“I’m – I’m not ready.”<br>
Draco kept going, and I could see the graveside in the distance. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Should you be doing this to her?<br>
She’s never been here before. If anyone can help her through this it’s you.<br>
She hates me.<br>
She needs you.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Draco, please.”<br>
“Hermione. It is long past time.”<br>
She gripped the door handle so hard her knuckles turned white. In fact, she seemed to drain of all colour. I imagined in my mind a monochromatic Hermione, devoid of colour, devoid of life.<br>
Draco turned another corner. “It’s just up there.”<br>
When we reached it, he got out and helped Hermione out. I stood to one side while he whispered something to her. She stared up at him with tear filled eyes.<br>
“Don’t make me do this…”<br>
“Where is it?” I asked Draco. He pointed it out, but stayed with Hermione. I set off. <br>
The graves here were nicely kept, many with flowers and little knick knacks lining them. The grass was clean and short, and if it had not been a place of such grief, it could have been a public park.<br>
“David Christensen, Erika Caan, Rhys Baxter…” I read as I walked along. <br>
Finally, I came to Ronald Weasley. I knelt before the headstone.<br>
“Ronald Weasley. Son, brother, uncle, friend. Sweet chance separated us, sweet chance shall bring us back together. R.I.P Ron.” I traced the words with my fingers as I read them. <br>
A shadow fell over me, and I saw Draco and Hermione standing there. Hermione dropped beside me, and he followed. She laid her head on his shoulder and I linked my arm through hers.<br>
Together we sat, lost in a world of silent grief.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Hey, Zeanna…”<br>
Some guy slimed up to her and draped an arm across her shoulders. Her cheeks turned pink.<br>
“Get off!”<br>
She ducked out from under him, and he snatched her wrist, forcing her to spin back to him.<br>
“Don’t fight me,” he whispered silkily. He wasn’t a bad looking guy, but he had an aura surrounding him that made him inapproachable and slightly fearsome. Zeanna glowered at him, not in the least afraid.<br>
“Don’t touch me and I won’t have to,” she shot through gritted teeth. “Let me go or I swear to God Michael, you will regret it.”<br>
He laughed in her face, and Zeanna showed a trace of fear as he gripped her wrist tighter and pulled her closer. <br>
“As if.”<br>
I’d been watching, motionless, until then. <br>
“Let her go, dog.”<br>
He turned, narrowed his eyes, then looked back at Zeanna. “Got yourself a friend, huh? Better than that fag-&quot;<br>
That did it. Dad trained me well, not just in magic, but in other…things. I reached out my foot, trying to hook it behind his legs. He turned around, stared at me, and I took my chance. I smashed my fist into his cheek, and although he staggered back, he reacted just as I expected-he dove for my legs, trying to take me out, and I slammed my hands onto his shoulders. He cried out and went down hard. I let my legs buckle, falling with him sideways and getting one foot behind his neck, sliding the other beneath his shoulders as I twisted myself and landed on his rib cage. A small bounce with my own momentum twisted his body and he found himself facedown on the floor, pretzel wrapped around me. <br>
“Gee,” Zeanna said, holding back laughter. “That’s gotta smart.”<br>
“Oh, this is nothing,” I replied casually. He tried to buck me off. “Uh uh,” I said. “Bad dog. Down. And don’t move. You’ll only make it worse.”<br>
The agonized look on his face told me he’d discovered that.<br>
“I figure,” I told Zeanna, “That right about now there’s a lot of pain going down. There should be little razorblades slicing up his neck. It should feel like a lot of pins are being stuck into his shoulders. Are your legs feeling a little numb?” <br>
I loosened my hold just enough for him to turn and look into my face. He nodded almost imperceptibly. <br>
“Can’t hear you…”<br>
A disgusted look crossed his face, and he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>spat</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> at me! I moved my head of course, so it flew right past me.<br>
“Sorry Charlie, wrong answer.”<br>
One hand was free, and I was used it to snatch his nose and yank it upwards. He cried out.<br>
“You might think I’m being loathsome and interfering,” I said conversationally, as if we were two friends having a chat, “but I have to be. People like you…they tend to…<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>annoy</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> me. In a big way.” I pulled his head back by his hair, knowing it would send yet more pain down to his joints. “Look at that. That was just so loathsome and interfering of me.”<br>
I decided to get up.<br>
“Give a hand,” I asked Zeanna, and she obliged, helping me up. Michael just lay on the floor, breathing. “Touch any of my friends again, and I will have to get more loathsome and interfering. Hear me?”<br>
He sat up slowly, clutching at his ribs. “Bitch,” he coughed out. I sighed.<br>
“Had to say it, didn’t you?”<br>
I let fly with a soft floor kick that connected with his chin, not hard enough to break anything, but sending him flying onto his back once more.<br>
“Bye now!” I waved cheerily. Zeanna and I left, stepping over him. She laughed in his face. <br>
“Nice show!” She hi fived me. <br>
“It was nothing.”<br>
“Are you kidding? He’s been hassling me since we were six. That’s the first time someone’s ever got the better of him. Could you teach me that hold thing?”<br>
I grinned. “If I did, I’d have to kill you.”<br>
She froze. “Oh…my…<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>God!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“What?”<br>
Unable to speak, she waved in the general direction of the next compartment. I peered through the glass.<br>
“It’s <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>him</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.”<br>
On the other side stood a highly unremarkable dark headed boy.<br>
“That? That’s your cookie?”<br>
“Biscuit. And yes.” She chewed a nail. “You have to go talk to him.”<br>
“What?! Why me?”<br>
“Well, I can’t!” she said in a tone that implied it was obvious. “He’ll know, won’t he?”<br>
“Not unless he’s a mind reader,” I muttered.<br>
“Come on. Please?”<br>
“Haven’t I done enough for you already?”<br>
“I never asked you to beat him up.”<br>
“It was written on your face.”<br>
“Just go! Please!”<br>
I grumbled about it but agreed. I walked over to him and stuck out my hand.<br>
“Hi. I’m Allegra.”<br>
He had strange coloured eyes, I noticed. Sort of…very, very dark purple, almost black. It unnerved me.<br>
“Ty. Short for Tyrius.”<br>
“Nice to meet you. See my friend?” I pointed her out, and she leapt into a seat out of view. <br>
“I did,” he said wryly. “What of it?”<br>
“She wants to talk to you,” I said simply. <br>
“What if I don’t want to talk to her?”<br>
“Hey, I don’t own you. Do what you want.”<br>
I went to turn, but he tapped my shoulder.<br>
“No, wait. I’ll come see her. What’s her name?”<br>
“Zeanna.”<br>
“Ah. Last name?”<br>
“Wood.”<br>
“Not hers. Yours.”<br>
“That’s for me to know-&quot;<br>
“And me to find out. Mysterious type. I’ll find out, Miss Allegra.”<br>
“Whatever.”<br>
Uninterested, I led him to Zeanna.<br>
“H-h-hi,” she stammered.<br>
“Hello.”<br>
With the utmost confidence, he took her hand and kissed it. I rolled my eyes.<br>
“Save it for Camelot, Tyrius.”<br>
“Tyrius,” Zeanna breathed. <br>
“Yo, Zeanna?” I snapped my fingers in front of her face. “You still with us? Ground control to Major Zee.”<br>
“Zee…” he seemed equally raptured with her. <br>
“Pass us a bucket,” I said, making vomit motions. They ignored me, so I left to get back to Aiden and Josiah. Unbelievably, Michael was still on the floor, so I stepped over him and into Aiden and Josiah’s part.<br>
“Wanna know something incredibly funny?” I asked Aiden. He waved me off. He and Josiah were obviously discussing something very deep, as Aiden had the tendency to do.<br>
“No way, England are gonna whoop France…”<br>
I sighed and settled into a seat.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
When we finally did get home, Hermione went straight up to her bedroom, Draco right behind her. I went into the kitchen to grab a drink, still in a slight state of shock. Seeing his headstone, with his name and date of birth and death, had hit home, waking me up to things. <br>
Not just things about Ron, either.<br>
I got a glass of water and downed it within seconds. I had two more then I washed the glass out. I wasn’t paying any attention though, and as I cleaned it with a scrubbing brush it slipped and broke the glass. Part of it sliced up from the side of my right wrist to the tip of my thumb, cutting almost to the bone. I cried out and stumbled back, instinctively covering my right hand with my left. Crimson was everywhere-it covered the sink cupboard door like paint, the linoleum, my clothes. I stared at the wound, insanely interested through the throbbing pain.<br>
To think that I could die from this cut, from this red liquid flowing out faster than I could stop it, seemed so absurd I almost couldn’t stand it. It was just blood. What did it matter? Why was it so important?<br>
If I left it long enough I might die and it didn’t scare me one bit.<br>
“Kat? What the hell have you done?”<br>
I looked dazedly at Draco. “Cut…” I held out my injured hand and more blood dripped to the floor. He gazed at it, seemingly as fascinated as me. But he came to his senses.<br>
“Alright,” he said briskly, grabbing a teatowel and wrapping it around my hand. I pulled it off.<br>
“What are you doing?!”<br>
“Leave it!” I yelled. “It doesn’t matter.”<br>
“Kat, listen to me. You’re losing a lot of blood-&quot;<br>
“I said it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>doesn’t matter!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“It does!”<br>
“No, it doesn’t! I’ve lost it all, Draco. Everything and everyone I cared about is pretty much lost to me.”<br>
“Kat, you’re going to the hospital.”<br>
“No!”<br>
“Kat!” He was getting angry, but to hell with him. He didn’t need me, he had Hermione. <br>
“Just…leave it.”<br>
“I won’t.”<br>
His face set with grim determination, he bent down and picked me up in his arms. I beat at him weakly, but he tightened his grip around me.<br>
“It’s for your own good.”<br>
“It’s just a cut!”<br>
“A cut that’s flooding my house.”<br>
I looked at the trail of blood I’d left. <br>
“You have to go, it will be better.”<br>
“That’s what I told you ten years ago about myself and no good has come of it. You were right. Every choice has a consequence.”<br>
As we reached the door, Hermione’s voice floated downstairs.<br>
“Draco…”<br>
He paused. I wondered if he would drop me and go running.<br>
He didn’t.<br>
And as we continued out the door, I thought I heard him tell me that I hadn’t lost everyone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Trip over, including a horrid journey across the lake with some huge old man named Hagrid. Thank God was all I could say as we hurried into the Great Hall.<br>
“Welcome, first years, to the Sorting. We will call your name and you will go to the front where the hat will sort you into your house, your family for the next seven years…”<br>
“Yeesh.”<br>
After Professor Petrie’s little speech was over we went into the hall. Hundreds of people stared at us, and I think everyone got a bit self-conscious. Even Michael, still smarting from my attack, shut up.<br>
“Ackerly, Michael!”<br>
“SLYTHERIN!”<br>
“Bestor, Holly!”<br>
“HUFFLEPUFF!”<br>
“Bemusel, Hazel!”<br>
“SLYTHERIN!”<br>
They went through so many names I lost count. I watched as Josiah, trembling, went up.<br>
“GRYFFINDOR!”<br>
Aiden looked immensely pleased. More and more names were called, until finally, finally, they called mine.<br>
“Granger-Malfoy, Allegra!”<br>
I sat under the hat, waiting for it to call out my new house.<br>
Waiting.<br>
Waiting.<br>
Waiting.<br>
I noticed some teachers glancing at watches, and students growing impatient.<br>
“I CANNOT PLACE THIS CHILD!”<br>
A hush fell over the hall and Professor Petrie looked confused. I heard the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore, say something like “It’s not possible!” and felt my cheeks get hot. Someone hurried over and snatched the hat off my head. Aiden mouthed something to me but I didn’t catch it.<br>
“Over here, dear,” Petrie said kindly, patting my back. She seemed worried though. <br>
“Hartnell, Alexander!”<br>
Professor Dumbledore was waiting to one side, waiting for me.<br>
“You must understand, this has never happened before,” he said gravely as the Sorting continued. “Never has the hat not been able to find one’s true place at Hogwarts.”<br>
“Are you-are you saying I don’t belong?”<br>
“Of course not. Simply that perhaps you pose quite a problem for the hat. A mother of Gryffindor, a father of Slytherin, you can see its predicament. You would have very strong qualities fighting for dominance in there, Allegra.”<br>
“How do you-&quot;<br>
“A good headmaster knows all about his students. Now, until this matter is resolved, I’ll ask you to stay in one of the guest rooms. Perhaps tomorrow we may try Sorting you again.”<br>
“But-&quot;<br>
“I’m afraid that’s all we can do, Allegra. Wait.”<br>

“It hurt?”<br>
“No.”<br>
There wasn’t even a scar. They knew their stuff, those wizard doctors. Part of me wished for a scar, but…<br>
“It looked pretty painful.”<br>
“It wasn’t,” I replied, lying. It had hurt like hell. <br>
Not just physically.<br>
“What actually happened?” Hermione asked.<br>
“Brush slipped. Cut the glass which cut me.”<br>
“Hm,” she said, uninterested. “I wonder how Allegra’s doing…”<br>
“For goodness sake, it’s only her second day!”<br>
An owl flew through an open window.<br>
“Impressive timing,” I stated as Draco snatched the letter from its claws. I knew he was as anxious as Hermione. His face fell as he read.<br>
“What? What? I know that expression. It leads to madness! And occasionally sweaty palms.” I tried to peek over his shoulder at the letter. “It’s from Allegra, right?”<br>
He nodded, but didn’t elaborate as he handed it to Hermione. She looked shocked.<br>
“They didn’t sort her?”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” I cried, grabbing the parchment.<br>
‘Dear Mum, Dad, and Kat,<br>
Staying in guest room, hat didn’t sort me, will try again and send you news as soon as possible. Love, Allie.’<br>
“Not the most communicative child is she?”<br>
“Not sorted?” Draco said, plopping onto the couch. “But…that’s never happened before…”<br>
“She’s a first in every way.”<br>
“How do you figure?” Hermione asked, reading over the words again.<br>
“First daughter of You-Know-Who, isn’t she? First not to be sorted. She was probably the first to turn the mailman into a punching bag.”<br>
“What?” Draco looked up sharply.<br>
“Uh, nothing. So, unsorted?” I said hurriedly.<br>
“Strange,” said Hermione.<br>
“Not really,” I countered. “Parents from different houses.”<br>
“But you’d think the pull of Slytherin would be much stronger.”<br>
Hermione made a face. “You just want her to be in Slytherin.”<br>
He didn’t deny it. “There’s nothing wrong with Slytherin.”<br>
I coughed “Voldemort!” into my fist. <br>
“One person out of how many that have passed through there? Hundreds! Hundreds of thousands!” His eyes got that glazed over look, like when Hermione was about to get into some lecture. “It is a fine house, an esteemed house-&quot;<br>
“An evil house.” <br>
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Gryffindor was full of idiots.”<br>
Hermione and I sat up at this and both began arguing with him.<br>
“It is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->-&quot;<br>
“It was far better than Slytherin-&quot;<br>
“At least half of our house didn’t need braces-&quot;<br>
“I learnt more in a year than you did in two-&quot;<br>
“And everyone in our house knew how to keep their mouths shut-&quot;<br>
“Alright, alright!” he bellowed. “It was a stupid comment.”<br>
“Damn straight,” I muttered. “But what we do about Allegra?”<br>
“Is there much we can do?”<br>
“I don’t think so,” Hermione said, fiddling with a cushion. “Just wait, I suppose.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allegra? Professor Dumbledore is here. He would like to see you.”<br>
I stood up and straightened my rumpled robes. I felt like I’d been in isolation since yesterday. I hadn’t seen Aiden, Josiah or Zeanna yet. <br>
“Allegra. I trust you slept well.”<br>
“Yeah.”<br>
“We will try Sorting you again.”<br>
He placed the hat on a chair, and I looked at it with loathing. Stupid thing. <br>
“Go on,” he urged. I sat down and put the hat on. It felt heavy.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>For a stupid hat.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Surprisingly, the hat began to murmur in my head.<br>
“Yes, yes, I couldn’t place you, could I? No, quite a challenge, the light versus the dark almost, with Slytherin and Ravenclaw qualities abundant, but I see you’ve had family in Gryffindor and Hufflepuff too. Yes, you pose a challenge. Let’s see…courage, lots of it, and strength, good, you’ll need that…intelligence…quick thinker, hard working…heart above all, I can see your heart, the light in it…yes, now that I’ve had more time to think, I can see that you should be in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>RAVENCLAW!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Relieved I threw the hat off. Dumbledore was smiling.<br>
“Yes, I thought as much. Well. Off you go then.”<br>
He looked at me expectantly.<br>
“Um…I don’t know where I’m going.”<br>
“Oh! Of course. I shall take you there myself.”<br>
And he did. He led me down windy halls and up spiral staircases. Eventually we arrived at a portrait of a knight. It moved excitedly, standing upright.<br>
“Professor Dumbledore, sir! What a surprise! Step inside, step inside, there’s no need for a password…”<br>
“Why, thank you Boris. But this young lady needs the password. She’s a Ravenclaw.”<br>
“Yes, sir, the password is Moonershin.”<br>
“Moonershin?” I said tentatively. The knight smiled benignly and swung open.<br>
“Excellent. Good luck, Allegra.”<br>
Dumbledore walked away and I stepped inside. Everyone in there stopped what they were doing.<br>
“What are you doing here?”<br>
A thought popped into my head. The hat had said I had strong Ravenclaw qualities. None of my family had ever been in Ravenclaw. How did that happen? And family in Hufflepuff? Since when?<br>
“I just got sorted.”<br>
“Oh, you’re that girl who the hat couldn’t place,” one girl dismissed. She turned back to her friend and they started talking again. I stood there stupidly.<br>
“Ignore her,” someone said from behind me. <br>
“Ty,” I said with relief. Someone I knew at least. “Where did Aiden and Zeanna get placed?”<br>
“Gryffindor, of course.”<br>
“Could-could we maybe go see them?”<br>
“Come on then.”<br>
We left the room, and I was aware of the eyes on us.<br>
“Why weren’t you Sorted?”<br>
“Um…hat needed more time.”<br>
“Okay.”<br>
He wasn’t the best conversationalist. He didn’t say another word until we got to Gryffindor tower. There was an empty portrait on the wall on which he knocked three times. <br>
“Ty?”<br>
“Yeah!”<br>
The portrait swung open.<br>
“Oh, hi Allie.” Aiden said unenthusiastically. “Ty,” he added with even less. Zeanna, however, threw herself in front of Aiden and smiled at us happily.<br>
“Hi, guys. Wanna go for a walk? What house are you in, Allegra?”<br>
Josiah saw us and came over.<br>
“Yeah, a walk. Good idea.”<br>
Aiden looked hesitant. “I might just hang around here.”<br>
I frowned. Something was up. “What’s wrong?”<br>
“Nothing. I just want to stay here, that’s all.”<br>
I didn’t push it. Josiah, Ty, Zeanna and I started walking.<br>
“Check out it,” Michael sneered. “Freak brigade abound.”<br>
I smiled sweetly at him. “Michael. How do your muscles feel? Up for another tumble on the ground?”<br>
His friends looked at him, aghast. “Nothing happened! She-&quot;<br>
I had to laugh. He couldn’t explain what had happened without damaging his reputation.<br>
“Freaks,” he spat, and his baboon friends guffawed. <br>
“Guess your muscles are fine.”<br>
I stepped up to him, and I couldn’t miss the fear that showed in his eyes. <br>
Nor the fear that was in Zeanna’s, masked with laughter. <br>
“Scared, Ackerly?”<br>
He didn’t reply. I left it alone.<br>
<br>

I twisted and turned on my bed, unable to sleep. Finally, I got my wand - induced    sleep is the best thing ever invented…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She can sense his fear, like a wolf can sense prey.<br>
Down the hall she creeps, slowly but surely gaining ground. When she reaches the portrait, she simply glares at it and it swings open, revealing an empty room. Instinctively she knows where he is, and stalks up the stairs into a bedroom. There are six beds there, each with a breathing lump in it. She finds the one she wants.<br>
And calmly, with no passion, just satisfation, snaps his neck.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I flew up in bed. Except I wasn’t in bed, I was twisted on the floor in the hall. <br>
What the hell had I just seen?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allegra! Get up, quickly!”<br>
“Muh,” I moaned. I felt someone shaking me. <br>
“Come on, they’ve found a body!”<br>
“What?”<br>
That woke me up. I moved after whoever it was that had woken me up. People were gathered in the common room, where two prefects were also standing.<br>
“There is no reason to panic. Yes, Michael Ackerly’s body was found lying outside Slytherin Tower, but other than that, nothing else has happened.”<br>
“Not good at spin control, are they?” I heard someone murmur. <br>
“Michael Ackerly? Isn’t that the boy we ran into yesterday?” Ty asked me. I didn’t reply.<br>
“What happened to him?”<br>
“His neck was broken.”<br>
I shuddered. I can handle looking at anything except for burns and broken bones.<br>
“When-&quot;<br>
“Last night, they think. That’s all we know. Classes will continue as normal.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Draco, get up!”<br>
I didn’t hear anything. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No. Not him. Please.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Draco?”<br>
I shoved the door open, and saw him there, very much alive. I had to resist my urge to hug him.<br>
“What is it, Kat…”<br>
“I gotta talk to you. Now.”<br>
Hearing the urgency in my voice, he got out of bed. Hermione didn’t stir.<br>
“I had a nightmare. Someone – I don’t know who – died last night. I know it was a male killed by a female.”<br>
“It was just a nightmare,” he said sleepily, like a parent trying to convince a child the monster isn’t real.<br>
“No, Draco, you don’t understand, someone’s dead, someone killed last night, and it was so real, I know it was real!”<br>
“How…”<br>
“It’s happened before. We’ve both had prophetic dreams before. This is the real deal and someone is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>dead.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I walked around to my classes in a daze, not hearing anything my teachers said. <br>
Michael Ackerly was dead.<br>
Only a few days before I had almost killed him. I knew that pretzel hold was designed to kill, if one knew the right jerks and movements, like me. <br>
And now he was dead. Zeanna looked pale, frightened, as did Josiah. Aiden would not speak to me. No one was any closer to knowing who had done it.<br>
But I knew.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“It’s the bad. The bad did it.”<br>
“Kat, come on. ‘The bad did it’? That’s as bad as my dog ate it. Someone might have had some kind of grudge against the guy.”<br>
“It’s different, Draco. Can you honestly tell me you felt nothing last night?”<br>
He furrowed his brow, lost in thought.<br>
“Down a hall. She crept into his room and she broke his neck.”<br>
I almost jumped up. “Yes. It’s real and we have to stop it!”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The night before, I’d seen a dark haired woman in my dreams. She made me feel as though there was nothing to fear anymore, that she’d take care of it all. I’d stayed in the room while she went away for a while. <br>
The snap had echoed throughout the school, amplified, terrifying. I couldn’t understand why no one else woke up. I wanted to know why, where she was. When she came back, she just smiled at me and put a finger to her lips. She ascended through the roof in a haze of bright white light and I wanted to cry out, tell her to stop and stay with me and protect me. <br>
I know who else felt my dream too. I know Dad and Kat must be happy now, because they know I have someone watching over me. Right? <br>
That’s who she was, someone looking after me…wasn’t she?<br>
But why did she kill Michael Ackerly?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I yawned as Draco scribbled a letter to Allegra.<br>
“Why are you bothering?” I asked. He was starting to get dark circles under his eyes, like me, I’d bet. “I don’t think it was at Hogwarts.”<br>
“Better to be safe than sorry.”<br>
“Since when was Draco Malfoy safety conscious?”<br>
“I have a family. Emelas!”<br>
The houseelf appeared in a fraction of a second. “Yes, Master Malfoy?”<br>
“Get this to an owl and have it delivered as soon as possible.”<br>
The elf took the letter and disappeared as quickly and quietly as she had come.<br>
“Handy little thing.”<br>
He merely nodded. <br>
“Worried.”<br>
“Very.”<br>
“I’m…” I trailed off. “I’m scared. I told you-&quot;<br>
“That this year’s bad is not a fan of easy death. I know.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I cornered Aiden after dinner.<br>
“Speak to me.”<br>
He looked away. <br>
“Aiden. What’s going on?”<br>
“Not here,” he muttered. “Library.”<br>
I followed him there and we sat down at a table. The wizened old librarian glanced at us briefly.<br>
“What’s going on? Why won’t you talk to me?”<br>
“I had a dream the night Michael Ackerly was killed.”<br>
“And?” I laughed, despite the fear threatening to drown me.<br>
“I dreamed that this woman came to you. Then she went and-and she killed Michael. She went back to you and then she left.”<br>
This came so rushed and quiet I had to ask him to repeat it. After he had, we sat in silence. He didn’t know what else to say, I didn’t how to reply.<br>
“Miss Granger-Malfoy. There’s a letter for you, urgent delivery.”<br>
“Huh?”<br>
Letter delivery for reserved for breakfast time, we’d been told. I unfolded the parchment and read it aloud.<br>
“Allie,<br>
If there’s anything going on at Hogwarts we need to know, alright? It’s very important. And please, please be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> careful</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>
Love, Dad &amp; Kat<br>
PS Which house are you in?”<br>
“They know something’s up,” Aiden said. <br>
“I need to write back. Got a quill?”<br>
He handed me one from his pocket and I wrote on the back of the letter.<br>
“Hi,<br>
There’s one thing. A boy was murdered last night, a Slytherin named Michael Ackerly. No one knows who did it. Somebody broke his neck. <br>
Love, Allie<br>
PS I’m in Ravenclaw.”<br>
I bit my lip. “I need an owl.”<br>
“I know where they keep them.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Here comes one.”<br>
While Hermione was out doing God knows what – I didn’t want to ask – Draco and I were keeping an owl watch. <br>
“She wrote back…” Draco scanned the letter. “Michael Ackerly. A Slytherin. She hasn’t said what year he is, and no one knows who did it. Just that his neck was broken. And she’s in Ravenclaw.”<br>
I glanced at him. “Ravenclaw? What if she…”<br>
“Dumbledore knows about the situation. I don’t think he’ll let it slip.”<br>
“What if the hat said anything?”<br>
“I don’t think we need to worry.”<br>
“Hogwarts…” I remembered the hall the woman had crept down. “Yes. Hogwarts.”<br>
“It’s started, hasn’t it?”<br>
He looked grave.<br>
“Yes. It’s started.”<br>
It didn’t help that his worried expression mirrored my own.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The next morning I felt a little better. No more dreams, no more deaths. I couldn’t help but feel slightly responsible for the death of Michael. I mean, the dream I had was like a prophecy or something. <br>
Or should I say the dream Aiden and I had. That scared me. But I knew it could happen, especially with people like Aiden and me who’d known each other forever.<br>
I hadn’t made any friends in Ravenclaw. The girls I roomed with were hardly aware of my existence, the people I had classes with just ignored me, except for Zeanna, Josiah, and Ty. Zeanna was a little wary around me. Probably because of Michael or something. <br>
Speaking of.<br>
His parents had come to the school. I’d been passing by when I saw them. I only knew they were his parents because they were talking about him. I thought they were kind of late, considering he’d been murdered yesterday. My parents would have been there within an hour. They didn’t even seem all that upset. Oh, his mother was crying the expected tears, but they were magically gone as soon as they came. Her make up remained perfect. I caught a snippet of conversation as they walked by me, nearly choking me with their expensive scents.<br>
“…yes, well this is the worst time of course, financial year and all, but it can’t be helped when our son is dead, can it?”<br>
“No, of course not, Vincent. The funeral must be planned, must keep out the riff raff the boy is sure to have made friends with…”<br>
It left me in shock. They talked about Michael as though he were…an inconvenience. I didn’t like him either, but they were his parents. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I was still loathe to sleep, two days after that horrible dream. Draco seemed to be fine. We’d told Hermione nothing. She stressed enough about Allegra anyway. Besides, it was only a few months before we’d be seeing her again. <br>
I jumped when a knock sounded. <br>
“Are you asleep?”<br>
“Ah,” I said as Draco popped his head in. “A question that can never be answered by yes. No.”<br>
“Me neither.” He moved in and sat on the edge of the bed. “I don’t really want to sleep.”<br>
“Want to go outside?”<br>
“Yeah. I can’t smoke inside.”<br>
“You smoke?” I cried, disgusted. I hate cigarettes.<br>
“Yes.”<br>
He drew a pack out of his pocket. “You?”<br>
“A world of no.”<br>
We went outside together, into the garden, and I sat on Allegra’s swing set. Draco preferred a non-moving seat. He lit up and breathed in deep.<br>
“That’s it,” he breathed, blowing a lazy smoke ring into the cold night air. “That’s the stuff.”<br>
“Keep that smoke away from me.”<br>
My father had smoked. Probably why I hated the habit so much. Ha, well, he was dead now so it didn’t matter did it.<br>
“So, you got any ideas on how to defeat this Big Bad?”<br>
“Well, we could not sleep until we do.”<br>
He stared. “I asked for ways on how to, not how not to.”<br>
“Ha. Funny. I don’t even know what it is, let alone how to defeat it.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
When I was in bed, listening the whispers and giggles of the girls around me, I felt more alone than ever. I lay awake long after they drifted off to sleep.<br>
Then again they didn’t have the fear that their dreams would kill someone.<br>
When sleep did come, it was fleeting and guilt racked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>There he went, with his head at a funny angle, hanging limply. She was forced to watch as he ran about crazily. His parents stood to one side, looking on in disapproval.<br>
“Look at the way he’s behaving,” his mother clucked.<br>
“Most unbecoming,” his father moaned. <br>
She tried to block her ears, but there was a roaring that kept her arms by her sides, her legs frozen, so she couldn’t run or even look away. Finally he got closer to her.<br>
“You did this. You did this.”<br>
He spat in her face and she opened her mouth and screamed for all she was worth.<br>
And if she was to believe him, it wasn’t much.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Do you feel that?”<br>
I nearly fell off the swing. “What?”<br>
Draco sat bolt upright, as though he was listening for something. “Allegra. She’s scared.”<br>
“In tune with your child. I can’t feel anything.”<br>
“Shush.”<br>
I shut up, and listened like he did.<br>
Far off, as though it was coming through a long tube, I heard a scream.<br>
“Is she in danger?”<br>
“No, I don’t think so,” Draco frowned. “I just…she’s scared.”<br>
“She’s screaming.”<br>
“A nightmare.”<br>
“Yes.”<br>
I knew it now, and relaxed. The distant screaming stopped. <br>
“She’s alright,” he assured me. I nodded to say I already knew.<br>
Deep down though I knew it wasn’t true.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I woke drenched in sweat. The blankets were twisted around me, and I tried to untangle myself. As I did the panic grew. I couldn’t escape, couldn’t get out-<br>
“Are you alright?”<br>
A girl stood beside me, worried. <br>
“I’m fine.”<br>
“Bad dream?”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You have no idea.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Um, yeah. I don’t remember.”<br>
“I’m Charisma,” she said, stifling a yawn.<br>
“Allegra.”<br>
“Nice to meet you. Need some help?” She gestured to the blankets and I shook my head.<br>
“No, I’m okay.”<br>
I managed to wriggle out and went to the bathroom. Assuring myself that I could move and that no one was after me, yelling that I did it, I washed my face and generally calmed down.<br>
Until the lights turned off.<br>
“What the-&quot;<br>
They turned back on.<br>
Michael stood behind me, neck at that same angle, with an angelic grin on his face.<br>
They turned off.<br>
I fell through the floor.<br>
They turned on.<br>
I screamed.<br>

The next morning Draco wound up going out with friends. I didn’t even want to know what they did. Crabbe and Goyle had shown up on the doorstep and I could barely contain my laughter. They were the same baboons they were years ago, except taller. Unbelievable. After he left, Hermione and I sat awkwardly in the lounge, neither of us sure of what to say.<br>
“So…” I said. She looked up.<br>
“Yeah.”<br>
“Talk to me. Come on. We were friends once.”<br>
“I haven’t got a lot to say.”<br>
“So say what you do have.”<br>
“If I did, you’d hate me.”<br>
“Try me.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I sat up groggily. The dark seemed to envelop me, and panic rose in my chest. <br>
“Hello?” I called. No answer. How the hell had I-<br>
Of course. I’d fallen through the floor Alice-style. I remembered Michael behind me and stood quickly, assuming a fighting stance. <br>
The unmistakeable sound of laughter reached me.<br>
“Come out!” I shouted. Then it struck me. I’d fallen through the floor, shouldn’t the big gaping hole still be there?<br>
A fast glance upwards answered that question. Sealed over. No light. In fact I could barely see two feet in front me.<br>
I felt someone rush past me and the fear started coursing through me again.<br>
“Stop!”<br>
They paid no attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
She sat up.<br>
“Alright. You want the truth?”<br>
“What do you think?”<br>
“I think that you don’t hate me.”<br>
I snorted. “Of course I don’t. I mean, how could I hate someone who turns around and stabs me in the back?”<br>
“You lost your right to him when you left.”<br>
“My <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>right?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Are you kidding me? So because I left, and your boyfriend left you, albeit accidently, you have the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>right</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to move in on mine? No. It doesn’t work that way.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Your fault, your fault…”<br>
I punched the dark, hoping to strike flesh. “It is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> my fault! It isn’t!” I kicked and punched as hard I could, to no avail.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Well, you can’t come back here ten years later and expect it all to be the same! It doesn’t work that way either!”<br>
“I didn’t expect things to be the same. But I didn’t expect you to be married to my boyfriend!”<br>
“Ex!”<br>
“He wasn’t when I left!”<br>
“You lost him when you left.”<br>
“So you keep saying. Dammit, Hermione. We were friends. How could you do this to me?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I punched again, and actually felt something. Not something solid. My hand passed through a cold mist, and I felt something damp attach itself to my arm. I shook it hard, trying to get rid of it. It slithered up my arm, crawling, climbing, bringing its ice with it, freezing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Mad enough to punch her, I sat on my hands. <br>
“I’ve been through more than you have for the past few years, Kat. You think it’s all about you? It was. It’s not anymore.”<br>
“Been through more than me? Hermione! My brother died. I got told that I was taking Narcissa Malfoy’s place in the story that was unfolding. I came home and nothing, nothing was the same. I couldn’t face my parents. Know why? Because when Hayden and I were little they killed our sister. I’ve got no family left. None! And I have to come here because the Big Bad’s gonna kill you all? Gee. That gives me such a happy. I’ve already lost my family, now I’m gonna lose my friends too. Fantastic. So I know I’m going to fight until I die just to protect you and Allegra and Draco! And you don’t give a damn if I die, because it means there’s no competition for his heart. A competition you know you can’t win, because I’m his first.”<br>
“You?” She looked at me down her nose contemptuously. “You were! Past tense! You aren’t any more!”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I screamed as the thing continued up my arm. Like a snake, it draped itself around my shoulders and I bit my tongue as my arms shouted for release. <br>
“Please,” I managed. “Please stop.”<br>
A light appeared in front of me, and my arms, back and shoulders began to burn. In the back of my mind a spell leapt forward.<br>
Did I have the strength to pull it off?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“When it comes down to it, he’s coming back to me,” she finished.<br>
“He feels sorry for you. It’s a pity thing. Can you really see him loving a Mudblood like you?”<br>
“What do you think you are?”<br>
Bugger. She had me there. We were both mudbloods. <br>
Yet somehow, the one who always claimed he hated any but purebloods, loved us both. <br>
Somehow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Through the burning, I focused my mind. The thing had worked it’s way around my midsection, and it hurt like I imagined the fires of hell would.<br>
“I cast you out, with the strength of those who love me! I cast you out, with strength of my own! I cast you out, with those who have passed before me! I cast you out, forever more! I cast you out! I cast you out! <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Get the hell out!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
The ice suddenly stopped hurting. It started shrinking. It worked!<br>
But it fought back.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“It doesn’t matter anyway.”<br>
“What doesn’t?”<br>
She stared at me, and I thought I saw fire in her eyes. Fear, fleeting and fast, flew through me. It went as fast as it came. <br>
“You. You don’t matter to him like I do.”<br>
I started laughing. “Oh, yeah. You matter. About as much as the house elf. Tell me, why do you think he married you?”<br>
“Because-because he loves me,” she replied uncertainly. <br>
“Loves you? He has a fate you can’t interrupt.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Something slapped me across the face. I wanted to go limp, make the pain go away, but the ice snake hadn’t given up like I’d thought. It kept going around my legs and I cried out. My spell hadn’t worked. <br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Don’t give up, baby. Don’t give up.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
A voice like sweet rain fell to me and gave me a drop of hope. I started my spell again.<br>
“I cast you out, with the strength of those who love me! I cast you out, with strength of my own! I cast you out, with those  who have passed before me! I cast you out, forever more! I cast you out! I cast you out!”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allegra and I, we’re his fate, not you. You can’t change that, just like you can’t ignore it. You’re far too rule-abiding to just ignore it, Hermione.”<br>
She just sat there for a moment.<br>
“When you left you took his soul, his very essence, with you. D’you know how hard it was for him? Yes, you were his fate, like Allegra. But you left. So you ignored-and you changed-that fate. He came to me after Ron-he came to me when I needed him. I was there for him where you just ran away and didn’t come back. He never gave up waiting, y’know? He always thought you’d be coming back. When we got to our final year at Hogwarts, I think he finally stopped. Then it happened and we got married a year after. He tired of waiting for you to come back.<br>
“You missed your chance.”<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The ice snake melted away and I fell to the ground, muscles aching with the joy of being free from the pain.<br>
“Stronger than I thought you were. But I knew you could do it. After all, you got me to the ground, didn’t you?”<br>
I glanced up. No one was there. I knew who it was.<br>
“Why are you doing this to me?”<br>
“It’s your fault I’m dead,” came the vehement reply. “Yours. I didn’t do nothing to no one. Not even to Zeanna. I was just messing around. But you came and then I died. It’s your fault.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I couldn’t even begin to form the words I wanted to say.<br>
He’d asked me to ignore fate, that last night, and I’d told him I couldn’t. Yet I had, and in a twisted way I’d changed it. I felt sick. She was right.<br>
She was right.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“I didn’t kill you!”<br>
“No. You didn’t come in the night and break my neck. But she did it for you. She thought you needed me gone.”<br>
“Who? Who did?”<br>
“I can’t tell you. The pain stems from more than the outside.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Missed chances. The entire time, he’d been standing there in front of me, offering me the choice. <br>
I only truly realised the consequence of refusing to say yes then.<br>
But it wasn’t too late. It couldn’t be.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“What do you mean? Tell me!”<br>
Tears of frustration stung my eyes as he laughed.<br>
“You begging me now?”<br>
“Never.”<br>
“You will. One day. You’ll find out what it’s like to beg for your life.”<br>
“Not you. I won’t!”<br>
I found the strength to stand up. “You’re dead. You don’t belong here.”<br>
“Ha,” he said. “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> don’t belong here. Why do you think it took the hat so long to place you? Why do you think you feel so alone, even when you’re surrounded by people? I may not belong here, but you, you’re not even supposed to live.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“You’re not worth it for him.”<br>
“Shut up!” I wanted to scream. I was going to if she didn’t shut up.<br>
“I’m telling you the truth. Kat, you’re <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>beneath</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> him.”<br>
I ran, I’m ashamed to say. I ran away from her, unable to stand her condescending tone, ran to the door and threw it open.<br>
A dark haired man tackled me to the ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Liar!”<br>
I ran blindly in the dark, praying that I would find a way out. It couldn’t end here. It couldn’t. Michael’s taunting voice followed me along the way.<br>
“Your fault, your fault, your fault,” he sang over and over again.<br>
“No it’s <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>NOT!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
I looked wildly around me, feeling like a caged animal surrounded by darkness. Even though I didn’t have a wand, I wondered…I’d performed one spell without my wand’s help. <br>
“Lumos!”<br>
Nothing. <br>
But wait.<br>
There was something…a light growing…from the roof!<br>
“Hello?” I shouted. “Anyone up there?”<br>
A hole appeared, and I wondered if it was the same one I’d fallen through. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Please, please, please let someone be there…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Allegra?”<br>
Charisma’s shocked face appeared above me.<br>
“Charisma! Get me out of here!”<br>
“How’d you get down there?”<br>
“Never mind! Just get me some help!”<br>
She nodded and ran off. I could hear her footsteps echoing, getting further and further away. I stood under the hole, bathing in the light, silently thanking the Powers that Be. <br>
“Wingardium Leviosa!”<br>
I found myself floating up through the hole. I was back in the Ravenclaw bathroom, and glimpsed myself in the mirror. I was a sight. My hair was a tangled mess and my face was streaked with dirt and tears. Charisma gave me a hug.<br>
“Are you okay?”<br>
“Yes,” I replied. <br>
Biggest lie I’ve told yet. <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Get off me!” I screamed. I beat wildly at the man who had me pinned to the ground. Hermione came running. When she saw what was going on, she tried to pull the guy off me.<br>
“Wait. Harry?”<br>
I stopped struggling.<br>
“You’re not Allegra,” he said, confused. I chanced a look at his forehead. <br>
Still there.<br>
“Do I look eleven?” I asked, incredibly pissed. “Dork!”<br>
“You sound it,” he laughed. I couldn’t help but join him.<br>
“Hand?” <br>
“Thanks.”<br>
As I stood up I got my first good look at twenty-five-year old Harry Potter.<br>
The hair was the same. Messy and sticking out in all directions. His scar was still there, although it looked less <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>there</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than it used to. Faded or something, if that were possible. He’d filled out, and his glasses were gone. <br>
He waved a hand in front of my face.<br>
“Long time, no contact,” I said finally.<br>
“Yeah. When did you get back?”<br>
“Few days ago. You?”<br>
He grinned and held up a broomstick.<br>
“This thing’s faster than Floo powder.”<br>
“At which point I will become nauseous.”<br>
He got me in a big bear hug.<br>
“Missed you,” he whispered in my ear. <br>
“Same here.”<br>
We broke apart and he went over to Hermione.<br>
“How’s my girl?”<br>
“I’m with-&quot;<br>
“Allegra.”<br>
“In Ravenclaw.”<br>
He looked shocked. “Ravenclaw? Is that good?”<br>
“Better than Slytherin,” Hermione shrugged. “As far as we know she’s doing alright.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I lay curled up on my bed. Charisma had tried three times to make me move before she finally left to go to class. I didn’t care if they tried to bust me for bunking. <br>
I was busy analysing everything that had happened beneath the floor.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“You don’t belong here. Why do you think it took the hat so long to place you? Why do you think you feel so alone, even when you’re surrounded by people? I may not belong here, but you, you’re not even supposed to live.”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I didn’t understand. Not supposed to live? And I wasn’t alone, not any more, I had Charisma in my house, and Aiden, Josiah and Zeanna. <br>
“Stupid,” I muttered to myself. “He’s just a stupid dead person.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“So how’ve you been?” Harry asked me.<br>
“Little bit of this, little bit of that,” I said carefully. Maybe he didn’t need to know about all this big bad stuff yet.<br>
Yes. He did.<br>
“Come on. I’ve got something to tell you.”<br>
“Sounds big.” His eyes grew wide. “No one-no one’s died, right?”<br>
“No. But it’s still important.”<br>
He followed Hermione and I after sending Emelas off with his things.<br>
“What’s going on? I know that look.”<br>
Hermione looked away.<br>
“Why’d you come back?” I asked. He looked a little taken aback.<br>
“It’s about time, I suppose. I’ve been away since…you know when.”<br>
I nodded. “Did you have a kind of feeling?”<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
“That something was going to happen and that you needed to be here.”<br>
“It wasn’t just me then.”<br>
“You too?”<br>
“Yeah. What’s going on?”<br>
I explained about the Big Bad. He started looking tense.<br>
“A boy was killed?”<br>
“Uh hm. Kid in Slytherin, Michael something. Broken neck. We haven’t heard from Allie since she told us that.”<br>
We all jumped when the door slammed and Draco announced he was home. <br>
“Malfoy.”<br>
There was a hint of that old loathing in Harry’s voice.<br>
“Potter. When did you get here?” <br>
Draco kept it cool. As in, freezing cool. <br>
“Not so long ago, actually.”<br>
“We were just talking about the bad,” I said, interrupting the icefest.<br>
“Is that why you’re here?”<br>
“I think so, yeah.”<br>
“Figures. Potter the Hero makes his grand return after killing his best friend.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Draco, shut up! You know as well as I do it wasn’t his fault!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Harry stood up. “I can see I’m not wanted here. I’ll probably see you all later.”<br>
“No, Harry. Stay.” Hermione flashed an unreadable look at her husband. “It’s alright.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The edge of the bed dipped.<br>
“Charisma, I’m not going to class, give up.”<br>
“Wagger.”<br>
A male voice. In a girls’ room. I sat up.<br>
“You’re not supposed to be in here!”<br>
On the end of my bed sat a boy who looked to be about seventeen. <br>
“Oh, in more ways than one, hon. You look like your mum, know that?”<br>
“Who are you?”<br>
He looked apologetic. “Sorry. I’m Hayden.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
After an extremely tense dinner, Harry came up to my room with me.<br>
“Was it a shock?”<br>
I knew what he was talking about. “Not so much a shock as a heart attack.”<br>
He laughed. “For us both. I was in France when it happened.”<br>
“Why did you leave? Hermione needed friends.”<br>
“And I needed space. Isn’t that why <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> left?”<br>
“Cheeky bastard.”<br>
“That’s me. You know, besides the physical, you haven’t changed a bit.”<br>
“Are you saying I’m immature?”<br>
“Yes. Yes I am.”<br>
I leaned over and punched him lightly on the arm.<br>
“Ow.”<br>
“Ha.”<br>
“Hey, I’m pretty tired. I might go to bed.”<br>
“Alright. See you tomorrow?”<br>
He smiled as he left. “It’s a date.”<br>
I went outside not ten minutes after he left. I needed the air, the cold slap in the face. Now we four were together, what would happen? <br>
“Well, well. You do get around.”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dad?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hermione</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Mione?”<br>
“I’m in here.”<br>
Draco popped his head around the study door. <br>
“Studying. I thought we’d left school.”<br>
“Ha. Just thought I’d get the jumpstart on the evil.”<br>
“Don’t stay up too late,” he replied, kissing the top of my head.<br>
“Never.”<br>
He left again, closing the door with a soft click behind him.<br>
“And to think after all the trouble that boy gave you and my son, you married him. So strange.”<br>
I felt my heart start to pound. <br>
“What-who’s there?”<br>
Someone spun my chair around.<br>
“Hermione. You spent enough summers at our house to know me, didn’t you?”<br>
“You…you’re sort of dead, Molly.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allegra.”<br>
He waved his hand. “Knew that. Was there when we named you. Oh, that was a party. Do you know you nearly got named Buffy? Kat’s fault, of course.”<br>
“Did you go to Hogwarts too?”<br>
“Yup. Nearly missed out. That was my parents. Didn’t want me leaving, you see. Kat was already gone.”<br>
“You know Kat?”<br>
“Know her?” he laughed. “Pushy broad’s my sister.”<br>
Yeah, that sounded right. They had the same accent.<br>
“Um, no offense, but what are you doing here?”<br>
“To talk to you, of course!”<br>
“How come?”<br>
His expression grew serious.<br>
“Because things are coming, Allie.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Don’t look so surprised. It does nothing for you.”<br>
I stood up, outraged. “What the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hell</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> do you think you’re doing here?”<br>
“I’m no happier about than you. But this is where I am. Deal with it.”<br>
“I will not! What are you? Demon or something? Cos I can fight you off!”<br>
He just laughed. “Not a demon. But not a ghost. I’m all solid. So I can still fight you if need be,” he said threateningly. It didn’t even remotely scare me.<br>
“What are you going to do, old man? Can’t backhand me like you used to.”<br>
He got up and faced me. He’d shrunk during his final years, and I finally towered over him like he once did over me.<br>
“Worse than that.”<br>
“Please.”<br>
He sighed. “Look, I’m only here cos of your mother.”<br>
“She hates me. Like you.”<br>
“Actually, she’s worried. She does want you to have some kind of inkling of what you’re up against. Can’t fight the good fight unless you know what you’re fighting.”<br>
“Gee. Don’t you make sense.”<br>
“Shut up girl, or I leave and I take it all with me.”<br>
I shut up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hermione</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“He still sings, you know.”<br>
I felt my heart thud harder.<br>
“What?”<br>
“You must remember that time when you sang to each other. When you all sang.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Like it was yesterday.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Y-yes.”<br>
“He still sings. Even though you can’t hear him, he still sings your song to you all the time.”<br>
“He…he can see me?”<br>
“See you? Love, he can hear you too. He’s been close enough to touch you at times, but you know Ron. He didn’t want to upset you.”<br>
I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t even begin to. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“What kind of things?”<br>
“Bad things. Things you’re going to need all your family for. I know your parents aren’t around, but it’s okay. You’ve got everyone you need to back you up.”<br>
“Bad things like what?”<br>
“Girl of a million questions, huh? I’m not sure what bad things. Just that if you don’t fight, the world may go apocolyptic on you. And that would be bad, Allie, very very bad.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Tell me what you know or I’ll kill you here and now,” I said through gritted teeth.<br>
“Already dead. But it would still hurt. So I’ll tell you.”<br>
He ran his hands through his remaining hair.<br>
“That little girl you’re so bent on protecting. There’s things about her you’d never even begin to guess about. Dark things.”<br>
“About Allegra? Pull the other one.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hermione</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“There are reasons why he couldn’t come himself dear, none of which I will try to explain, even though I know how clever you are.”<br>
“He can hear me?”<br>
She just nodded. <br>
“Ron? If…if you’re there…I miss you.”<br>
The tears fell, and Molly Weasley looked on passively.<br>
“It hurt so bad, and it still does…I can’t even begin to tell how much I miss you, Ron. You left the biggest hole inside me and I thought I’d never close it.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I frowned. “Why are you telling me this? Why aren’t you telling someone else, an adult or something? Maybe they could do something.”<br>
“Because you’re special, Allegra. You can do things most wizards would never dream of attempting.”<br>
“There’s nothing special about me.”<br>
“You’d be surprised.”<br>
“But…I’m just me, just normal.”<br>
“Allie, you are you and that’s a brilliant thing. But you’ll never be normal. No offense,” he said, eyes twinkling. “You’re destined for great places, Allegra. To do great things.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Is this anything to do with the Big Bad?”<br>
“Big Bad? Is that what you’re calling it? Too stupid for an original name. Just stick to your stupid Muffy.”<br>
“Buffy.”<br>
“Whatever. Point is, that Allegra’s going to be trouble for you.”<br>
“How? She’ll help us fight. She’s got ten times the mental guts you do.”<br>
I looked pointedly at his beer belly. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hermione</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“But then I did, and I let go of you, finally. And it doesn’t mean I don’t love you still, because I do, so much, more than you might ever know now.”<br>
I paused for breath and Molly patted my back.<br>
“He hears you. Doesn’t mean he cares.”<br>
“What does that mean?”<br>
“Oh, he let go of you a long time before this. He doesn’t actually care.”<br>
“But-you said…”<br>
She smiled. “I said and you believed. For a clever woman you are very naieve.”<br>
“Who are you?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Like what?”<br>
He hesitated. “I didn’t want to tell you, but all heroes know their fate and they face it with heart, like you will.”<br>
Heart thumping, I asked what he was on about.<br>
“You, Allegra, will save this world.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Anyway, Allie will help us stop the Big Bad. You’re wasting your time.”<br>
“Help you stop it?” He doubled over with laughter. “Stop it? You’re so far off I can’t even see you.”<br>
I narrowed my eyes. “What do you mean?”<br>
“Allegra’s not going to help stop it. She’s going to raise it.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hermione</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Get out,” I said, hating the tremble in my voice. She laughed.<br>
“Too much? You worked it out then. Yes, I suppose Molly Weasley wouldn’t have been so tactless.”<br>
“Who are you?” I repeated. <br>
“Someone you’ll get to know very well over the next few months, I think.”<br>
Molly’s face twisted into something grotesque, a mockery of what she had been. Her voice echoed as the thing disappeared into thin air.<br>
“You wait. Voldemort, he was nothing. He’s just a practice run. You might have won that, but I’m not so easy. You and your little friends are bugs and you’re all about to be squashed.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“M-m-me?”<br>
“You.”<br>
I heard footsteps coming down the hall.<br>
“I have to go.”<br>
“No, wait!”<br>
“I can’t. Look, I’ll help you out where I can. Tell Kat I love her!”<br>
And with that, he was gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I lost it. I went nuts and punched him.<br>
Except…he wasn’t there to punch. <br>
Alone and stunned from what I just heard, I sat down on the grass.<br>
It couldn’t be true. <br>
It couldn’t.<br>

<br>
I went to sleep after he left, I was that drained. I awoke to Charisma shaking me.<br>
“Allegra? Do you want something to eat?”<br>
“Oh, leave her Charisma. She’s not gonna talk to you. She’s a freak.”<br>
In one perfectly co-ordinated motion I threw a shoe at the direction of the voice. A satisfying yelp came and Charisma snorted. “Ignore her,” she whispered to me. “She’s just a bully. Are you alright?”<br>
“I’m fine.”<br>
“Are you sure? You fell down a big hole and you’ve slept half the day. Maybe you have concussion. Do you want to go to the hospital?”<br>
“Charisma. I am fine.”<br>
She still looked doubtful, so I sat up. “I’m going to class tomorrow. Did any of the teachers say anything?”<br>
“I told them you weren’t feeling very well. Hungry?”<br>
“No.”<br>
She sat there helplessly, unsure of what to do. “Okay, well then…I’m going down the common room. Want to come?”<br>
I shook my head. She left. As soon as the room was empty I started writing a letter to Kat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Kat? What are you doing out here?”<br>
“I…you didn’t just…see a dead person did you?”<br>
Draco stared at me as though I’d gone crazy.<br>
“No. Can’t say I did.”<br>
“I just saw my dad.”<br>
Draco didn’t know much about my history. Not my parents, anyway. I wanted to spare my friends that particular time of my life. So he didn’t react much.<br>
“And?”<br>
“And he told me some things about Allegra.”<br>
“Like what?”<br>
How do I say it? I wondered. How can I tell him what I just heard, when I’m not sure I believe it?<br>
“I don’t know if it’s true or not…”<br>
“Spit it out, Kat,” he said, sensing my hesitation.<br>
“HesaidAlliemightnothelpusstoptheevilbutshesgonnaraiseit.”<br>
“Okay, now slower.”<br>
I inhaled. “He said Allie might not help us stop the evil. He said she’s going to raise it.”<br>
He sighed. “I knew someday I would have to tell someone. Didn’t think it would be you I’d have to tell, though.”<br>
“What are you trying to say?”<br>
“Allegra…well. We all know she was never going to be normal. Look at her parents.”<br>
“Cho was normal. Her father’s the problem.”<br>
He laughed bitterly. “Big problem. Allegra’s the Reaver.”<br>
“Be kind. Rewind. Who, what, why?”<br>
“The who is Allegra. The what is the Reaver. The why is because once every hundred years or so they pop up and generally cause a bit of trouble for people.”<br>
“What the hell is a Reaver specifically?”<br>
“You know the Big Bad you’re feeling? We’re all feeling? The Reaver.”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Allegra?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
I could almost see the weight on Draco’s shoulders. The weight I was sure he’d carried alone. <br>
“How did you find this out? Isn’t Hermione Super Researcher?”<br>
“Haven’t you noticed how powerful Allegra is? Already she’s far ahead of what we are even now. I know you’ve seen Mr. Puffy.”<br>
“You knew about that?”<br>
“Of course.”<br>
“Why didn’t you do anything?”<br>
“I didn’t want to alert her that I knew.”<br>
“Does she know herself?”<br>
“The truth? No. I don’t think she has a clue. If she did…”<br>
“It would kill her. Will you ever tell her?”<br>
“What was it Cho and Cedric sang that day?” he grinned. “Oh, yes. I’ll never tell.”<br>
“You still haven’t told me how you found out.”<br>
“When Allegra’s powers started growing beyond our expections, I got curious. I consulted some friends. One told me that kids should not be able to do complicated charms, transfiguration, hexes and the like. So I did some research into it. Allegra didn’t just fit into gifted children. She fit into the profile of the Reaver.”<br>
“How so?”<br>
“The Reaver is always an orphaned girl. Somewhere in their lineage there is dark history. They never have sisters.”<br>
“You realise you just described a large percentage of the girls in this world, right? Any one of them could be a Reaver.”<br>
“I’m not an idiot, Kat. I performed a spell that was created to identify the Reaver. It’s Allegra.”<br>
“What happens to a Reaver?”<br>
“Not a, the,” he corrected. “Only one at any time. There has never been two Reavers because the time frame is simply too far apart. One hundred years or so. Anyway. The Reaver is usually the cause of some big evil that threatens to destroy the world.”<br>
“And if you defeat the evil, the Reaver, like, forfeits or something. Right?”<br>
“I wish.”<br>
I knew there was something he didn’t want to tell me.<br>
“What are you not saying here, Draco?”<br>
“I’m saying to defeat the evil…”<br>
He paused, and that weight seemed to get so much more heavier.<br>
“The Reaver has to die.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Dear Kat<br>
I don’t feel so good. Maybe I’m not supposed to be here. I don’t think I’m fitting in so good. I just fell down a big hole and Charisma-the only friend I’ve got in my house-pulled me out. Some stuff happened down there, and I’m so scared. I saw Michael Ackerly, and he told me it was my fault he died, but I didn’t do it, I swear it! But I had a dream about who did, but the lady who did it was just protecting me, I didn’t ask her to kill him or anything like that.<br>
But something else happened today. Your brother came to see me. Is he your younger brother? He looks like he’d just finished Hogwarts. He told me to tell you he loved you. And he told me I was going to save the world. I don’t know what to do, so I’m writing to you. What do I do? Save the world from what? Is that why you came back, to help me? Because that would make sense…<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Oh, Draco…”<br>
“But it’s alright,” he said, with a glimmer of hope in his eyes. “Because it seems that from all the texts I’ve read, the Reaver has to call on the evil. And Allegra’s just not that stupid. And if the time passes for her to be the Reaver, then that’s okay. It means she’s safe. We’re safe.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But…it’s going to happen. You know that. It’s not coincedence that Harry and I both come back around the same time with the same feeling.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“But she’s mine.”<br>
The raw emotion in his voice saddened me.<br>
“She’s not. She’s your sister, yeah. Harry’s too, but when it comes down to it, you’re going to need to detach yourself from her completely.”<br>
“Are you saying we will have to kill her?”<br>
“If she raises the Big Bad Draco, what do you think?”<br>
“That I can’t kill her! Neither could you!”<br>
“This is what I mean. Detachment. In the end, the world has to come before Allegra.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
…but even if you didn’t that’s okay. Because I’ve got Mum and Dad, Uncle Harry too, because he’d come back if I asked him. <br>
I don’t know if I believe Hayden though. How could I save the world? Maybe it was some kind of trick. I haven’t got any kind of special gift. What do I have that would save this world?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Are you going to tell Hermione or Harry?”<br>
“I can’t. The less people who know the better.”<br>
“But if she-&quot;<br>
“She won’t.”<br>
“You’re not facing this, are you?” I said angrily, getting frustrated with him. “There’s always choices. Always. And even if we don’t like what we have to choose, we have to do it because other people depend on it.”<br>
“Would you?”<br>
“What?”<br>
“Would you die to save the world?”<br>
I didn’t reply.<br>
“I thought as much. It’s alright for Allegra to die, but not you.”<br>
“Actually, I would. I’d know that it’s what I have to do. And I’d do it gladly because at least then you’d all live.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Michael acted like I was evil, and someone evil couldn’t possibly save the world. <br>
Do you know that the Sorting hat is so stupid? It told me I’d had family in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Since when? Do you know if I have? Maybe I need to ask my parents. I’d like to know.<br>
You don’t think I’m evil right? I know what I did to Mr Puffy Vandelay was wrong, but I didn’t…I wasn’t going to leave him like that forever, and anyway like I told you he tortured puppies. I’ll never do anything that evil. I even left my curse box at home. You can have it if you want. I won’t be needing it anymore.<br>
I know I’ve gone about rubbish. Sorry. But I needed to get it off my chest. I suppose I’m finished for now. Please write me back. <br>
Love, Allie.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
After my little proclamation we both sat silently. <br>
I think on some level we would do what we had to do. We always did.<br>
“You can’t tell anyone about this.”<br>
I didn’t miss the hint of pleading in his voice. <br>
“I’ll never tell.”<br>
And it was a promise that proved so very hard to keep.<br>
<br>
<br>
Aw thanx guys. More right after this.<br>

<br>
“Wait for me!”<br>
I tore down the stairs where Charisma was waiting.<br>
“What’s first?”<br>
“Um…that would be herbology. Professor Sprout.”<br>
“What’s she like?”<br>
“A little bit odd. But nice.”<br>
“With…”<br>
“Gryffindor.”<br>
“Excellent.”<br>
We went to the Hall first, and I could see Aiden, Zeanna, and Josiah eating together. Zeanna threw me a self-conscious wave.<br>
“Charisma, did you tell anyone about me down the hole?”<br>
She looked uncomfortable. “Well, it wasn’t me who pulled you out. Shikyna did.”<br>
“Shikyna?”<br>
She peered around and pointed her out. “There. But she didn’t tell anyone. Why do you ask?”<br>
“No reason.”<br>
I tried to catch Aiden’s attention. He was absorbed in his food and I gave up pretty quickly. Soon I was as interested in my breakfast as he was, and conversation was lost. It felt like I hadn’t eaten in days.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The morning after made the world seem dark. <br>
I can’t explain. It was as though…after what Draco had told me, nothing was going to be right. The world had committed a wrong against us.<br>
But it always happened. We should have been used to it.<br>
“Letter for you,” Hermione said absentmindedly. She threw me an envelope with a Hogwarts stamp. I was surprise she hadn’t swooped on it and read it already.<br>
‘Dear Kat,<br>
I don’t feel so good. Maybe I’m not supposed to be here. I don’t think I’m fitting in so good. I just fell down a big hole and Charisma-the only friend I’ve got in my house-pulled me out. Some stuff happened down there, and I’m so scared. I saw Michael Ackerly, and he told me it was my fault he died, but I didn’t do it, I swear it! But I had a dream about who did, but the lady who did it was just protecting me, I didn’t ask her to kill him or anything like that.<br>

And he told me I was going to save the world. I don’t know what to do, so I’m writing to you. What do I do? Save the world from what? Is that why you came back, to help me?

I know I’ve gone about rubbish. Sorry. But I needed to get it off my chest. I suppose I’m finished for now. Please write me back. <br>
Love, Allie.’<br>
I covered my hand with my mouth, feeling nauseous.<br>
“Hermione. You saw someone too, didn’t you?”<br>
A feeling dread washed over me. I knew it. Her, me, and Allie. We’d all seen something last night.<br>
“Molly Weasley,” she said quietly. <br>
“My dad.”<br>
The anger we had both felt dissipated, leaving only the fear and sorrow.<br>
“Allegra saw Hayden.”<br>
“It’s not good news, is it?”<br>
“I don’t think so. What did Molly Weasley say to you?”<br>
“It wasn’t really her. She…changed. Into something horrible. Evil.”<br>
I looked up. She looked as though she were telling the truth.<br>
“She said that Voldemort was a practice run, and that she wouldn’t be so easy. That we were all about to be squashed.”<br>
“Molly’s the Bad?”<br>
“No. I think it was just assuming her form.”<br>
“You just bumped creepy up to a whole new level.”<br>
“Don’t I know it.”<br>
A thought struck me. If Hermione hadn’t been talking to the real Molly Weasley, how could I be so sure Allie and I had been talking to Hayden and Dad? Despite what Draco had told me, I couldn’t see my brother lying to Allegra. And I knew what my dad was capable of…<br>
I got a bit dizzy, my head spinning with possibilities.<br>
It seemed that the only way I could get a hold on things was to tell Hermione what I knew. Then we could sort out what was real, and what wasn’t.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The warning bells went off. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She can’t know!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I nearly fell asleep in Herbology. I felt my eyelids getting heavy…and before I could drift off Zeanna gave me a sharp nudge with her elbow.<br>
“Wake up!” she hissed. “Professor Sprout’s coming around.”<br>
Pushing away the urge to just go back to sleep, I sat up and tried to look attentive.<br>
“Allegra Granger-Malfoy!”<br>
I winced at the use of my full name. Doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue.<br>
“Yes?”<br>
“Are you with us?”<br>
“Oh, yes. This is really interesting…a pile of interesting worms.”<br>
“They are not worms, they are…”<br>
I wasn’t paying attention by this stage, and neither was Charisma.<br>
“Hey, who’s your friend?” She waved her hand at Aiden. <br>
“Aiden.”<br>
“He’s cute.”<br>
“Ew!”<br>
“What? He is!”<br>
“I’ve known him forever, so not thinking in that direction. He’s like my brother or something!”<br>
She gave him a quick once over.<br>
“You know, he looks familiar. I’ve seen his picture somewhere…”<br>
“Where?”<br>
“It’ll come to me…” Brow furrowed in thought, she continued to stare at him. I leaned over to Zeanna.<br>
“So, you and Ty…”<br>
Her eyes got all glazey.<br>
“Yeah. Isn’t it great?” She gazed at him, across the room, in rapture.<br>
“Uh huh. Real great.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ugh. All we need is me and Josiah and it would be a game of Imperfect Partners.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Draco and Harry came into the kitchen silently.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You have to tell her.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I didn’t miss the panic that flashed in his eyes.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No!<br>
Draco, come on! She has to know.<br>
No, she doesn’t.<br>
So what if I tell her now, huh?<br>
Don’t!<br>
Why don’t you want her to know? Because you’re just protecting Allegra? Or because you’ve kept something this big from her for so long? <br>
I just don’t want her to know, okay?<br>
Tell me the truth.<br>
Because if I told her, I know that she’d kill her! Alright? Hermione doesn’t hesitate to do what she has to do, and I couldn’t take it!<br>
Exactly. You couldn’t take it. But it’s not about you anymore.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
My words to Draco from last night bounced around in my head.<br>
‘There’s always choices. Always. And even if we don’t like what we have to choose, we have to do it because other people depend on it.’<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
After we left Herbology I almost jumped for joy. I think I’m allergic to plants.<br>
“What do we have now?”<br>
Zeanna consulted her schedule. “Break.”<br>
“Great.”<br>
We walked to the courtyard where some of the older kids were mucking around on broomsticks. <br>
“Hey, can we have a go?” Josiah yelled to them. One, in the blue trimmed robes of Ravenclaw, smiled and nodded. He came down to land and I heard Charisma draw in a breath. <br>
“Whoa.”<br>
“I second that,” Zeanna said breathily. <br>
“You two are pathetic. Hey! Can I have a go?”<br>
The other guy, a Hufflepuff, came in fast but pulled up right in front of me. I noticed Aiden had jumped aboard the other broom and started laughing.<br>
“What are you laughing at, Granger?”<br>
“That’s Granger-Malfoy!”<br>
“Race you!”<br>
“You’re gonna lose!”<br>
Zeanna ran up and counted down from 3.<br>
“3…2…1…go!”<br>
Not a big courtyard, but I left Aiden eating my dust. But he plays dirty.<br>
“Oh, Allie!” he sang. I didn’t turn around until I felt something hit me.<br>
“Ow!” Tickling charm! I fell sideways off the broom, falling, falling, falling…<br>
“ALLIE!” Charisma shrieked. In an instant they were at my side, including a crowing Aiden.<br>
“Ha! I won!”<br>
“You <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>cheated!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” I protested. I gasped when a pain shot up my arm.<br>
“Anything broken?”<br>
“My pride…my good racing name…maybe my little finger. Other than that, nope.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“There’s something you need to know about Allegra.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kat! Please, you know them, you know they’ll do it-<br>
As I said Draco, it’s not about you anymore. That’s who you’re really worried about.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“What?” Harry asked, looking worried.<br>
“Allegra is the Reaver.”<br>
The meaning was not lost on Hermione. I knew by the way she reacted, tears filling her eyes and her hands gripping the table. Harry only stared at me blankly.<br>
“Reaver?”<br>
“You remember how I told you about Buffy?”<br>
Some of the confusion left him. “Allegra’s a Slayer? Slayers exist?”<br>
“One girl, in all the world. But she’s different. It turns out…Allegra’s not going to help save the world from impending Apocolypses. She’s probably going to cause one or two herself.”<br>
“Did you know?” Hermione asked Draco in a tight, controlled voice. He looked away.<br>
“Draco. Did you know?”<br>
He refused to look at her and left the room.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Thanks a lot, Kat.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“He told me last night.”<br>
Nail in his coffin. Hermione went white with rage.<br>
“I can’t stand this!” she screamed. She ran from the room, leaving just me and Harry there. I wasn’t sure what she couldn’t stand – me, Draco, or the secret he’d kept.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Don’t ever do that again!” I yelled. Aiden looked surprised at my anger.<br>
“What? You’re always saying you’re a good racer. I thought you could handle it.”<br>
“Handle a Tickling charm. One of your dad’s specialties! Uh huh, whatever, loser.”<br>
I injected as much venom as I could into the ‘loser’.<br>
“I am not a loser!”<br>
“Loser!”<br>
“You’re just jealous!”<br>
“Of what?!”<br>
“I got into Gryffindor straight away! You had to wait! The hat didn’t know where to place you, and I’m the loser?”<br>
I reached up my hand and punched him hard across the face.<br>
It hit him in the odd place where your jaw meets your neck. There was no time to even try and abort the attack. My fist smacked him hard and something broke with a wet snap.<br>
“A-A-Aiden?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Reaver…”<br>
Harry still looked confused. I explained a bit more.<br>
“This is bad.”<br>
“Thank you, Captain Obvious.”<br>
“Well, I-&quot;<br>
Draco came back in, puffing, his face red.<br>
“I think we may have a slight Apocolypse!”<br>

<br>
Josiah shoved me back as Aiden fell to the ground. Charisma and Zeanna were by his side, and I thought I saw tears in Zeanna’s eyes.<br>
“Zee, get help!”<br>
She nodded and ran off. Charisma moved closer.<br>
“Is he okay?”<br>
“I can’t tell.”<br>
He glanced back at me. “Pack a powerful slap.”<br>
I couldn’t even move. Aiden seemed so still. Eventually I scrambled to him, bent over his pale form.<br>
“Aiden? I’m so sorry-&quot;<br>
“Move!” Josiah snapped. A teacher was coming through.<br>
“What happened?”<br>
No one replied and the teacher simply rolled up his sleeves and hauled Aiden off the ground. <br>
“I’m taking him to the hospital wing.”<br>
We started trailing after him, but Josiah stopped me.<br>
“Maybe it’s best if you stay here.”<br>
“But-&quot;<br>
“Not maybe. It is. Don’t come round him for awhile, eh?”<br>
And they left me there, standing alone as they took away my best friend.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We followed Draco out of the kitchen and into the attic.<br>
“What the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hell</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is that?”<br>
“Duck!”<br>
We all hit the floor as a huge piece of wood came tumbling toward us. There in the ceiling was a black hole, almost reaching wall to wall. Lightning bounced around in it, and the faint boom of thunder echoed off the walls. <br>
“Again, what the hell is that?” I repeated. Harry shook his head in wonder.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Draco Volans!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Hermione was there. Tiny bat things started flying around, and I got a mental image of little bats with Draco’s head. <br>
“And just what are they?”<br>
“Draco Volans! Bat-type creatures! Watch out for their teeth, the bite is fatal!”<br>
Harry batted one away and it fell to the floor, no longer moving. But more were there to take it’s ugly little place.<br>
“I need my wand!” I went to leave the room, but Draco stopped me.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Accio</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wands!”<br>
The door flew open and mine and Harry’s wands lay on the floor. We both swooped down and grabbed them up. Hermione was aiming little bolts of energy all over the place – kind of close to both me and Draco, I thought – so I followed her lead. Harry muttered “Avada Mentum!” which I understood to be the lesser of the Avada curses. <br>
“Avada Mentum!” <br>
Blue and green energy took out the Volans, and I laughed madly as they fell to the floor, dead.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Aiden!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
An anguished voice. A hurt voice. Undeniably Allegra’s voice.<br>
“You all heard that, right?” I asked hesitantly.<br>
“She’s causing this,” Hemione gaped. “Allegra’s doing it.”<br>
At that premise moment, Allegra’s face actually appeared above us. I think I screamed. I don’t remember too well. It could have been Hermione.<br>
“Now that we know that,” I shouted above the sudden roar, “How do we stop it?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I bunched up my fists and punched my pillow again. I’d taped it to the wall. <br>
“What are you doing?”<br>
A shocked girl walked in and I ignored her and kept up the pillow attack. She stepped in between me and the wall. I punched anyway, feeling something give way, snap under the pressure.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Maybe a rib.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
She screamed and fell to the ground. I punched the pillow again. Someone had heard the scream and came running up to see what was going on.<br>
“What the hell – Amanda?”<br>
I suppose Amanda was the girl cowering on the ground. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Don’t care, doesn’t matter, don’t care, doesn’t matter…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Oi! You! Stop that!”<br>
Darkness. That’s all I felt. I turned and delivered a roundhouse kick to the person who had told me to stop.<br>
“Make me,” I said lazily. Clutching her chin, she backed off. I started punching again, but kicked every second time. Punch, kick, punch, kick…punch away the hurt, kick away the pain. Punch away the anger, kick away the fear.<br>
“Help!” the girl screamed. “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Help!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
And help came running. And help could not touch me. I spun faster than ever, throwing kicks and punches, blows and jabs. Not once did I miss. I wasn’t getting out of breath. There were people piling around me.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Allie!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Charisma’s voice reached me where the others did not. <br>
I knew what she was going to say.<br>
She stepped toward me, snatching my arms and stopping my movement. I let her. I’d already hurt one friend today.<br>
“It’s…”<br>
I knew. Her eyes were red, rimmed with tears fallen and unfallen. <br>
“Aiden.”<br>
It’s strange the amount of power one small word can have. All the meaning that can placed on it.<br>
All the horror.<br>
All the painful truths.<br>
“Allie, I…”<br>
All the blame.<br>
Placed on me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I hadn’t had a work out this hard since we’d gotten rid of Mr. Puffy. More and more ugly creatures seem to flying out, faster than we could immobilise them and kill them. Hermione had a frightening cut dripping down the side of her face, and I suspected Draco had a broken bone somewhere in his body, judging by all the things that had fallen on him.<br>
But it stopped. Unbelievably the hole closed. The creatures disappeared. <br>
“It’s over, isn’t it?” Hermione said, eyes squeezed shut. <br>
“It’s over.”<br>
I wiped the sweat off my forehead.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We just witnessed her real power, didn’t we?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
His grim nod was enough. I brushed tears away from my eyes. No wonder he hadn’t wanted anyone to know. God.<br>
No wonder.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“They did everything. But something happened, something stopped them from healing him completely, and it stayed, the wound stayed and it wouldn’t fix and he…he…”<br>
She dissolved into tears again. <br>
I was numb.<br>
“I’m going to the hospital.”<br>
Stepping over numerous moaning people, I made my way to the door. Charisma didn’t try to stop me.<br>
Instinct more than knowledge guided me to the hospital where a white sheeted lump lay. There were sad faces all around – Zeanna was sobbing, Josiah holding her loosely. He tensed when he saw me, and I wondered if he’d told anyone that it was my fault.<br>
“Broken neck,” Zeanna cried. “It was a broken neck, Allie.”<br>
I almost turned on my heel and ran. I’d broken his neck. I couldn’t stand it. I walked over and tore the sheet off, letting it settle around my feet. <br>
Weighing me to the ground.<br>
There he was, head at the most wrong angle possible.<br>
Had I done that? How? I just…I just slapped him. I didn’t do anything.<br>
“They know.”<br>
Josiah’s words were heavy with sorrow. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I could drown in them.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Allegra.”<br>
Dumbledore’s voice was ominous. I didn’t want to know what he was going to say.<br>
“I don’t know how you did it. But what you did killed this young man.”<br>
I shook my head violently. <br>
“No!”<br>
The windows exploded.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allegra.”<br>
Harry sounded impossibly sad. Draco nodded again.<br>
“She can’t stay there. At Hogwarts. She could hurt someone.”<br>
“Michael Ackerly told her she was evil.”<br>
They all paused to stare at me. <br>
“Michael?”<br>
“Dead boy.”<br>
“She’s not evil,” said Hermione desperately. “She’s not.” She turned to look at Draco. “Is she?”<br>
He didn’t reply, just put his arm around her. I got a chill but shoved it away.<br>
“Where do we go from here?” Harry asked, smiling sadly. No one had any reply.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Zeanna screamed as the shards cut into her, and I heard Josiah yelp. None of it touched me. It was like I was behind an invisible shield – it simply collapsed around my feet. Dumbledore muttered something and the glass froze in mid air. It just stopped. He said something else and it fell to the ground.<br>
“Impressive,” he murmured. “Very impressive. Step outside for a moment. Madam Gellance, would you attend to these two.”<br>
I followed him outside.<br>
“Allegra, I must ask you something, and it was imperative that you answer me truthfully. Do you understand?”<br>
I nodded, wondering what on earth he would have to ask me.<br>
“Have you ever heard of anything called the Reaver?”<br>
“No.”<br>
He seemed taken aback, but regained his composure quickly.<br>
“I have reason to believe you are the Reaver, my dear. And that is very serious indeed.”<br>
“What’s a Reaver?”<br>
He didn’t answer my question. “I think that if you are, you’ve just caused a great deal of trouble for your parents and friends.”<br>
Reaver…<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Got me,” I replied as we left the attic, ignoring the mess that it was.<br>
“I suppose we need to contact Allegra.”<br>
“And do what? Bring her here?”<br>
“It’s safest,” Draco argued. “Now that we know what she can do…” He let that hang in the air. <br>
“Dumbledore can handle it,” Harry said without hesitation. “He’ll not what to do. Maybe he’s even seen another Reaver in his time.”<br>
“Mei Keang. Raised hell until she was finally killed, and supposedly even then she took out a great many wizards and witches, although that was never fully proved. The records of the time were deemed unworthy as the man who kept them went insane.”<br>
“You’ve done your research.”<br>
Draco only smiled melancholically at this. “I know about the past three Reavers.”<br>
“Any of them related to you?” Harry mumbled under his breath. <br>
“They’d be related to you too, you prat,” I shot back. “So how exactly is a Reaver chosen?”<br>
“Chosen? Please. Reavers are made.”<br>
“Made? I don’t understand…”<br>
“It’s not that hard,” Draco said tiredly. “Voldemort must have known that any daughter he had would have had the capability to be the Reaver. So he made her with that intention in mind.”<br>
“And all that hate bottled up in her…all the hate from him to this world…it’s about to go off.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I’d gone to the library. Of course Dumbledore had tried vainly to stop me, but I wouldn’t allow it. I just went to the library, pushing all thoughts of anyone else away.<br>
“Are there any books on the Reaver?”<br>
“What do you want to know about her for?” asked the librarian sourly. <br>
“I just do. Are there?”<br>
She rattled off some names and I tracked three down. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The History of Darkness, Slaying the Reaver</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Nighttime.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. No idea what that last one had to do with anything.<br>
I ws worried though. All the titles pointed to the Reaver being something bad, something evil.<br>
And that would mean Michael was right. <br>
I cracked open <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Nighttime</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. It turned out to be a sort of journal, with daily entries in spidery writing. I tried not to read it out loud as I skimmed over it, searching for mention of the Reaver.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She’s scaring me, with her fast movements. She cracked a tree trunk today just by lightly slapping it. The physical power in her, not just the magickal, is progressing at an abnormal rate. It’s frightening. Nothing will slow the inevitable that I now realise is coming.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I didn’t get it. I flipped over a few more pages.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mei is as frightened as her parents. I watched them today, monitored their response as Mei told them what she would become and what they must do. She may run for her life, they said, and they would let her. There would be no shame in running if Mei were allowed to live.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Mei. Whoever she was, something bad was happening to her way back then.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Her parents allow her to go. But her brother knows that she must not live. Her brother will be the one to end it all as I stand by, bound to kill her but unable to. I can only hope that somehow this will end peacefully for Mei. It is my only wish.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Why couldn’t she live?<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>There are demons walking this town like hell on earth. Mei’s doing. Mei’s accidental doing. Her brother is after her and she’s fleeing, but I can keep up easily. She’s only twelve after all.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
That got me. I felt dizzy. Twelve and she was raising demons. Accidentally. I had to keep that in mind. It wasn’t her fault.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So it’s over for her now. I am not struggling to believe this. I knew that despite my wishes for Mei it was inevitable. Her brother did it, as I suspected he would. Took a gun and shot her in the head. Her blood spilled into the rift she had created through her fear and anger. It closed. The demons, the evil, went with her, as did the taint Mei spread throughout the town. For the first time in twelve years the sun sets without the Reaver there to stop it. Mei is gone. Mei is dead. As is the fate of the Reaver. Yet I know there will be another. It has been foretold. Another will come and taint and stop the sun from rising evermore. It will continue, this practice, this source of evil, but as long as there are ones brave enough to make the choice I believe there can be a safe world. I must believe it. For Mei, I must believe it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“So she needs to be here,” Hermione finished firmly. “Where we can keep an eye on her.”<br>
“She’ll be home soon. Let her be normal just a little while longer,” Draco pleaded. Role reversal right in front of my eyes. Draco was the one begging for a change.<br>
“She’s never been and never will be normal. She needs to be home.”<br>
Harry nodded in agreement. “Pull her out.”<br>
“Kat?”<br>
I ignored the plea in Draco’s face. “Yes. Pull her out.<br>
“Bring her home.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There was no explosion. There were no tears.  <br>
There was only the silence and the blood pounding in my ears. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Reaver blood.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Doomed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> blood, if I was like Mei. <br>
I didn’t have a brother. Who would be the one to kill me? <br>
“Allegra.”<br>
Dumbledore again. He took the book from my hands gently and glanced at the cover.<br>
“I was hoping you would not find out like this. The fate of the Reaver is indeed a grim one.”<br>
“She has to die.”<br>
“Yes. I won’t lie to you.”<br>
“Is-is she evil?”<br>
“There are many interpretations of what the Reaver is.”<br>
“And is that one of them?”<br>
“Some percieve them as evil, yes.”<br>
“But what are they, if not evil?”<br>
“Then,” he smiled, “they are good.”<br>
It didn’t make any sense.<br>
“But how…”<br>
“Reavers are so often misunderstood. You are not evil. Never believe you are. While the intent of the creator might be dark, the Reaver herself is not. I don’t want you to forget that.”<br>
“But Mei caused so much pain…”<br>
He sighed. “I have no way to explain to you the sole purpose of the Reaver. I cannot. There are no words good enough and I don’t trust my own interpretation to satisfy you. One day though, there will an explanation fitting for you. And I hope you can find it.”<br>
He left me in a whirlwind of confusion.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>i understand that you were lovers from school<br>
but how did you get from being his girl<br>
to just being his fool?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
That very moment Hermione and Draco set out writing a letter to get Allegra back. The day crawled by, and I passed it by mostly wandering aimlessly around. By the time night fell I was ready to let go and just crash. <br>
“Night.” Draco leaned against my door as I went in. <br>
“Night.”<br>
He didn’t leave though. He carried on standing there. I went back to shut the door, but he put his foot in the way.<br>
“What do you want?” I asked him warily. He came in and shut the door himself. The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>snick</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it made when it shut seemed so loud. It also let me know that the door was locked, something Draco must have had installed when my back was turned because it hadn’t been there before.<br>
He sat on the chair opposite the bed, flopping into it like a particularly agreeable rag doll. I sat down awkwardly, one leg folded under me, sitting on my hands. Not the most comfortable way to sit, but it wasn’t the most comfortable situation.<br>
“So.”<br>
He looked up, surprised. His face was unreadable.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What are you here for? And why is the door locked?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Locked?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he said idly. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I didn’t mean to.<br>
Bull. You never do anything you don’t mean to. Tell me the truth.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Do you remember that day when my father was here?”<br>
I understood he meant Voldemort.<br>
“Clear as crystal. Why?”<br>
“Because everything I said then I meant.”<br>
“You can’t anymore.”<br>
“Why can’t I?”<br>
He stood up then, and I did too. I moved to the other side of the room, trying to keep distance between us. He came toward me and closed the gap.<br>
“Because you’re not mine like you once were, and I’m not yours.”<br>
He moved closer still. <br>
“So change it.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Draco…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Closer again. He was inches away from me now, and put his hands on my shoulders. I forced myself not to look away.<br>
“You’re not supposed to do this,” I told him.<br>
“I know. That’s why I want to.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I couldn’t go back to Ravenclaw. I was sure I’d filled at least half of the hospital beds. So instead I went to find Professor Dumbledore to ask him if I could go home. He actually found me first.<br>
“Allegra. I was just looking for you. I received an owl from your parents not twenty minutes ago.”<br>
“What about?”<br>
“Why, you, of course. They’ve asked that you be sent home for your own safety.”<br>
“Why?” Warning bells sounded in my brain.<br>
“They have not elaborated further. But they have requested that you are sent home immediately. I have contacted Fred Weasley, who has to come out to see his son. He has agreed to take you back with him.”<br>
“But Fred-&quot;<br>
“He doesn’t know the circumstances of his son’s death, Allegra. I think you should keep it that way, hm?”<br>
I bit my lip and nodded.<br>
“He will be arriving sometime tonight.”<br>
He turned to leave.<br>
“Professor, I can’t go back to Ravenclaw tower.”<br>
“No. I suppose you can’t,” he replied without turning back. “Go back to the guest rooms.”<br>
I trudged off, more than a little upset, mulling over all that happened in a day.<br>
More than anything what surfaced in my mind was one fact.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I killed my best friend today.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I made myself shift. I went to the door and opened it. He was faster than I was. I could remember a time when he’d seemed inhumanly fast, and that what he was like now. He got to the door and shut it again, and this time I saw the lock I’d never noticed before. He slid it into place and I shoved him out of the way to get to it, to unlock it and throw it open. He grabbed my hands and while I struggled, I had to face facts. Draco was much stronger than me. However, I could fight. I brought my knee up, but he sidestepped deftly to avoid it. So I bounced and shoved my hands down into his rib cage, but to no avail. He stopped the attack by simply squeezing a pressure point in my wrists. I felt my knees go weak and almost buckled. He picked me up, but in a way so that I could barely move. One arm was squashed against his chest, and he’d bunched my legs up so that they were just dangling. Slowly he lowered me to the floor. I held in my scream, feeling the anxiety rise up and almost take over. What was he doing to me?<br>
“You feel what I do, I know it! I’m going to make you feel it!” he grunted. I couldn’t believe it. Where was this coming from? He was hurting me, putting his weight on top of me, and I struggled beneath him desperately.<br>
“Draco, please!” <br>
He ignored me and pinned my arms to the ground.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Draco!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Finally I bucked and he fell to the side. He scrambled to his feet, face red, hair tousled. I felt tears rolling down my cheeks.<br>
“What the hell are you trying to do to me?”<br>
“Kat-&quot;<br>
“Get the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hell</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> out!”<br>
“I-&quot;<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Get out!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Come near me again and I swear to God I will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>kill</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you!”<br>
He almost ran from the room. I snatched my stuff together, piling it into a bag.<br>
“Kat? I heard yelling.”<br>
Harry. I wondered if he’d seen Draco scampering in the opposite direction. He must have. <br>
He took in my red eyes, messed up hair. Draco had managed to tear a tiny hole in my shirt, and Harry’s eyes drifted over that. He didn’t say anything, just stepped over to me and took me in his arms.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allegra? Mr. Weasley’s here.”<br>
Whoever it was left Fred standing there alone in the doorway. I knew he’d been crying.<br>
“Allie.”<br>
I ran into his arms and I felt tears dripping onto my head. <br>
All I wanted then, more than anything I’ve ever wanted in my life, was to have Aiden back. To give back the life I’d taken from him. <br>
It hurt like hell that I couldn’t.<br>
“Angelina couldn’t come. We have family coming. Bill and Charlie are coming home. George, Percy and Penelope too.”<br>
I realised it was the second time the Weasley family had lost a member in two years. First Ron. Now Aiden. <br>
Ron had been Uncle Harry’s fault too.<br>
“I’m so sorry,” I whispered.<br>
“It’s not your fault, love. It’s alright. Perhaps we should get you home soon, eh?”<br>
“Fred,” said Dumbledore warmly. “Hello. Come this way.”<br>
He led us back to the hospital. There were a few people in there, about three.<br>
And Aiden’s sheeted body. <br>
Fred gripped my hand tight as Madam Gellance pulled the sheet down to his chest. The pressure on my hand got almost unbearable.<br>
“God. Aiden.”<br>
“I understand this is hard.”<br>
Dumbledore’s voice was sorrowful. I felt very small standing next to Fred. Aiden looked smaller though. And so young. He hadn’t always looked that young. His red hair flopped into his closed eyes, and his mouth was little more than a slash across his face. Unable to handle it I grabbed the sheet and pulled it back over his head.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“I’ll kill him.”<br>
Harry said it so matter-of-factly I almost panicked.<br>
“Harry…”<br>
“No. Kat, he hasn’t got a right to do this to you or Hermione.”<br>
“I know.”<br>
“Allegra will be back later on tonight.”<br>
“I’m leaving.”<br>
“I’m coming,” he said automatically.<br>
“You can’t.”<br>
“Why?”<br>
“Because…” I couldn’t find a reason. “I don’t belong here. I left.”<br>
“And what did I do? I took off the moment things got tough. Harry the hero, Potter the legend. The boy who lived became the man who ran. And I feel so much shame I can’t even stand it. So I’d be happy to get out of here. I’d be running again.<br>
“But I’d be running with you.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Fred and Dumbledore talked quietly about arrangements off to one side while I stared intently at the white lump that was my best friend. <br>
“Did…did he feel any pain?”<br>
“Hm?” Madam Gellance glanced my way. “No. And if he did, it would have been very little.”<br>
I was strangely unassured.<br>
“Did he die from when I hit him or did he die here?”<br>
“Instantaneous.”<br>
I went over this in my head. <br>
“Where do you think he is right now?”<br>
She stopped doing whatever it was she was doing and put her arm around my shoulders.<br>
“I can’t tell you for sure. No one is certain of where we go after we die. But I like to imagine that right now, Aiden is in a place where he is loved.” [after school special alert!!-India]<br>
“He has an uncle who died last year. Do you think they’ll be together?”<br>
She gave me a quick squeeze. “I’m sure they will.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I’d pulled my bags into the hall, and Harry was busy getting his things together. We didn’t know where we were going to go. <br>
“Kat. What are you doing?”<br>
I stiffened. Draco was standing there staring at me incredulously.<br>
“Don’t talk to me. It’s none of your business.”<br>
He took a step towards me.<br>
“Another step and you’re dead.”<br>
“Big talk,” he sighed. “You know you don’t mean it.”<br>
“Try me.”<br>
He took me at my word and backed off. <br>
“Leaving?”<br>
“Smart. Now get away from me.”<br>
He went away and Harry appeared, armed with bags.<br>
“You sure? You don’t have to come.”<br>
“No,” he said firmly. “I do.”<br>
Together we went downstairs, juggling our stuff, trying not to fall. When we got to the door I had to drop it to open it, so I did.<br>
There stood Allegra and Fred.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Kat? Uncle Harry?”<br>
“Where are you two off two at this time of night?” Fred asked. The usual sense of jovialty was gone from his voice.<br>
“We were…”<br>
“Just taking this stuff upstairs,” Kat finished hurriedly. “I don’t know where your parents are…” She tugged Harry and her bags away up the stairs. “You’ll find them!”<br>
“Mum? Dad? I’m home!” <br>
Fred dragged my trunk inside.<br>
“Allie!” Mum came barrelling out of the hall like a little kid and wrapped me in her arms.<br>
“Careful…the weaker one needs air!” I yelped as she squeezed me tight.<br>
“I’m so glad you’re safe.”<br>
“Hermione. There’s something you need to know,” Fred said bluntly. The tears were dry on his cheeks. Mum didn’t look all that surprised.<br>
“Aiden died today.”<br>
Her hand flew to her mouth.<br>
“Oh, Fred…”<br>
I don’t know what ran through her mind then. Maybe Uncle Ron. Her face paled and she looked ill. Scared above all. <br>
“How?”<br>
“Freak accident. He fell off his broom.”<br>
So that had been Dumbledore’s story. It was a wonder Fred hadn’t asked why they had been unable to heal him.<br>
But if the Reaver has some kind of super strength…<br>
“Allegra. Get Emelas to take your things to your room.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“We can’t leave now. For Allegra’s sake. She’s going to need us.”<br>
“For <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>your</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sake we need to leave. Kat, be reasonable. You matter as much Allegra.”<br>
“No, I don’t. Because she’s the one the world is balanced on, not me. And we can’t let her tip the wrong way or <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>everybody</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dies!”<br>
Harry shook his head. “To think this is all because of two men. I’m disgusted with my self for even knowing them, let alone being related to them.”<br>
I shrugged, trying to keep the hurt out of my voice. “That’s just the evil that men do.”<br>

<br>
“I don’t know if I can go.”<br>
Mum finished brushing my hair. “Yes, you can. We’re all going to be there with you.”<br>
“Even Kat?”<br>
She handed me my brush and I took it. “Even Kat.”<br>
“Uncle Harry?”<br>
“Uncle Harry.”<br>
“Piper?”<br>
“Piper Weasley,” Mum said, laughing. “Penelope and her P names.”<br>
“She could have named her Prudence. Or something else really horrible.”<br>
“Pan.”<br>
“That’s a boy’s name!”<br>
“No, there was a girl when I was at Hogwarts named Pan. It was short for something though.”<br>
“Panelope?” I suggested.<br>
“Don’t be daft,” she grinned. “Now, off with you. Breakfast.”<br>
For a day like this it was unbelivably sunny and warm. So were my parents’ moods. I didn’t know if it was a front or not. <br>
“Morning, sweetheart.”<br>
“Morning.”<br>
Kat walked in, saw Dad, and abruptly walked back out again. I didn’t have the time to wonder why as Uncle Harry did the exact same thing and breakfast was shoved in front of me. I wolfed it down, brushed my teeth, and was ready and waiting. <br>
After awhile everyone else was ready too, and we were all gathered before the fireplace.<br>
“Floo powder,” Kat moaned. Uncle Harry grinned and took her hand. Dad frowned when he saw this.<br>
“My first time was so bad,” Harry recalled. “I wound up in Knockturn Alley. And who should I see there doing dodgy dealings? None other than our very own Malfoy Sr and Jr.” <br>
Dad didn’t say anything.<br>
“Everyone ready?” Mum asked. <br>
“Yup.”<br>
“Come on.”<br>
“Let’s go.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Kat!”<br>
“Penny,” I inclined my head. She waved from the other side of the room. “I can’t believe this. This is a-&quot;<br>
“Hello there, Katarina.”<br>
I winced. Percy. The same stuffy guy as in school, except with wrinkles.<br>
“Hiya, Percy.”<br>
“Through this way. We’re about to start.”<br>
“It’s so formal,” Allie whispered, holding onto my hand. “I don’t think he’d have wanted this.”<br>
“Oh, look. There’s Angelina,” Hermione said in a hushed voice. She looked worn. “Where’s Fred?”<br>
“There…”<br>
“Come on.”<br>
Allegra lead me inside and we sat in a pew about four rows back. There was a small closed casket at the front, covered with flowers, photos, and cards. A grim looking reverend shuffled some papers and opened a bible in front of him, clearing his throat.<br>
“Dearly beloved…”<br>
“Has he got his ceremonies mixed up?” I muttered to Harry, who nudged me to tell me to be quiet. The reverend continued.<br>
“And now Aiden’s friend Allegra will deliver the euology [sp?].”<br>
Allegra had started trembling violently, and I gripped her hand for a moment before she left to go up. She gave me a tiny smile.<br>
“To tell you the truth, I really didn’t want to do this. Because it means I finally have to say goodbye, and I don’t want to. To me, doing this meant letting go of everything Aiden was to me, my best friend since forever. But I realise that’s not true. I’m not letting go of it. I’m celebrating it.”<br>
She paused and looked at me. I shot her a thumbs up.<br>
“So I’ll tell you some stuff about Aiden. He was a quidditch obsessed freak. I’m not joking.”<br>
That drew a laugh from the people around the church.<br>
“He loved talking about it, and he was a great racer. Not as good as me. But almost. He had new friends on the train to Hogwarts just through talking qudditch.”<br>
She waved to someone, I didn’t see who.<br>
“One thing I’m always going to remember about him is his charms. He had the meanest Tickling charm I think I’ll ever see, and I ought to know because I was on the receiving end of them more than once. Aiden was a smart guy. Much smarter than me. I had the brawn, he had the brain.”<br>
Draco, Hermione and I all laughed at that. Allie was one of the smallest girls we’d seen boarding the train for Hogwarts.<br>
“He told me that when he got older he was going to take over Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. I could see him doing just that. There would have been a lot of ticklish people screaming for mercy.”<br>
Fred and George smiled.<br>
“There’s so much about him I can tell you, but I won’t. We’d be here for days. So much good, so little bad, really.<br>
“All I can say in the end about Aiden is that I’m going to miss him for the rest of my life. Aiden, wherever you are, you’re my brother and I love you. The last thing is this: Words plain with lullaby refrain, so sweet sleep, enjoy the time you keep. And if you should call, I’m going to follow after all, so sweet calm, will keep us safe from harm..”<br>
Her voice broke and she started crying, but she started singing a song.<br>
“I’m finding my way back to sanity again, though I don’t really know what I’m gonna do when I get there, take a breath and hold on tight, spin around one more time then gracefully fall back to the arms of grace, cos I am hanging on every word you say and  even if you don’t wanna speak tonight, that’s alright, alright with me, cos I want nothing more than to sit outside heaven’s door, and listen to you breathing, that’s where I wanna be.”<br>
She was sobbing now, but she got some last words out. “I want to be where you are Aiden, but it’s not possible. I know that one day we’ll meet up again and you’ll push me off my broom.”<br>
She almost ran back to us, and sat on Hermione’s lap, tears still streaking her face. The reverend went back up and said some more, and we sang hymns. I don’t even remember what they were.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Are they having a wake?”<br>
“No, I heard Fred say…”<br>
The voices drifted over me as I stood by myself in the centre of the room adjoining the church. People were slowly leaving, saying hushed condolences to Fred and Angelina. <br>
Soon it was the Weasley family, Dad, Mum, Uncle Harry, Kat and I there in the room. I played with Piper, Percy and Penelope’s eight year old daughter. Suddenly she burst into loud tears.<br>
“What?”<br>
“I…I…don’t understand!” she whimpered. From where we were standing we could see Aiden’s coffin. “Why’s he in there? Why can’t he come play with us?”<br>
Struck dumb, I could only stare at her. How could I answer that?<br>
“How come he’s in there, and he’s not moving or talking, and Mummy and Daddy and everyone are crying, and there’s just a body and I don’t understand why he can’t just get back in there and be okay again, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I don’t understand why!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Couldn’t tell her it was because of me. He couldn’t move or talk or play because of me. No one knew. <br>
“I know,” I whispered. “It’s stupid, it’s human and stupid. I don’t know why either,” I lied. <br>
“Allie, hon? We’re going to go.”<br>
Kat tapped my shoulder lightly and took my hand. <br>
The Floo trip was all the same thing. Nauseous. Fitting. Everyone went their separate ways, but Dad and I went down into the gym. He strapped up his hands and started shadowboxing. I started beating the crap out of the punching bag. 1, 2, punch. 1, 2, kick. 1, 2, spin kick. 1, 2, left hook.<br>
“Allie, stop for a minute. I want to give you something.”<br>
He paused, then pulled something from behind his back. I took it curiously. It was a book.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Slaying the Reaver</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
It was old and tattered, the pages yellow and crinkling. It <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>smelt</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ancient.<br>
“That’s the original. Thought it might make some interesting reading.”<br>
“Dad, I know.”<br>
“Know what?”<br>
“About the Reaver. About how I might be it.”<br>
An ill-judged kick hit the wall. “How-&quot;<br>
“Dumbledore.”<br>
“That bastard,” he muttered. “He swore…”<br>
I ignored him and flipped through the book. There were several gory illustrations depicting the deaths of people. Girls.<br>
Reavers.<br>
“But if I’m the Reaver, why’d you give me this?”<br>
He began to walk away, and his voice grew faint.<br>
“Just in case.”<br>
I sat down on a bench and started to read. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Harry and I sat outside, not talking. I fiddled with my hair and he laughed, the sound a welcome change from silence.<br>
“You still do that.”<br>
I gestured to his own messy hair. “You still have that.”<br>
He tugged at it self consciously. “Yeah, well…”<br>
“Leave it.” I batted his hand away from his hair.<br>
“Does it seem strange?”<br>
“That was out of the blue. Does what seem weird?”<br>
“Being here.”<br>
“No. It feels weirdly right, though. You know?”<br>
“No.”<br>
“It’s like…I’m needed here, where I wasn’t back home. Like I told you, Allegra’s going to need us. All of us.”<br>
“Draco included.”<br>
“She thinks he’s her father.”<br>
“She knows we’re brothers.”<br>
“I’ve worked that one out.”<br>
“But what she would do if she knew the truth?”<br>
“It would kill her.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“The Reaver is a tradition steeped in lore, myth and legend. Approximately every one hundred years a Reaver appears. The tradition has been traced back to the first century, when magickal beings first walked the earth. For eons then, there has been good.<br>
And there has been the Reaver.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Or we would.”<br>
“Yeah.”<br>
“Would you be able to?” he asked.<br>
“She’s not related to me. She’s not my daughter, or my sister. Yet she feels as much a part of me as if she was my own. She <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>could</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->have been mine. But I walked out.”<br>
“But if you had to…”<br>
“If the world depended on it, what else could we do?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“The Reaver’s capabilities extend beyond mere magick and superstrength. They often show extraordinary psychic powers such as telekinesis. They have the power to call any primeval power they wish, at any time, simply by being angry or afraid. The Reaver appears to be able to summon forces of darkness at will, however accidental it may be, proved by cases throughout the ages.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“We could find a way to get rid of the Reaver in her,” Harry replied, sounding inspired.<br>
“And how do you suggest we do that without killing her? Expelling something that deep within her has to have consequences. If her death is one of them…”<br>
“She’d have to be dead anyway. To get rid of anything rampant that she inadvertantly called up.”<br>
We both went quiet again. <br>
“Do you think somehow she knows about Cho and Cedric?”<br>
“How?” Harry panicked. “How would she know?”<br>
“I was just wondering. On some level she might know. If that were to come out, who knows? Something Reaver-ish may just bust out of her. We don’t know if she can get control over this thing.”<br>
“Of course she can’t,” he said dismissively. “Otherwise all the others could too.”<br>
“You don’t know that. Maybe she can get control of it, stop anything from happening.”<br>
“Stop us from having to kill her, you mean.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“As fasr as records go, there has always been one of almost every Reaver, even short ones, some only simple drawings. We can tell from these that all but one Reaver has ever lived past twenty-one, and if they do, it is pure ‘dumb luck’.  The one that lived was a deaf mute in the 1600s. <br>
Many Reavers are killed by family members, usually males of close relation such as brother or father. A reason for this has never been discovered. Reavers that are not killed by relations are often slayed by those recording their lives, those who often go insane afterwards.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“It’s not like I want to kill her. You know that.”<br>
“I know that. I feel the same way.”<br>
But I also knew that he felt he’d do what he had to. Like me. Like Hermione.<br>
Even like Draco.<br>
“But to save this, what wouldn’t I do?”<br>
His voice seemed to be Draco’s, and when he moved his hand over mine, my head swam. It was Draco’s. Screams escaped my mouth.<br>
“Kat? Kat!”<br>
He snapped his fingers in front of my face and I came back into place.<br>
“Sorry…I…just drifted off there for a minute.”<br>
Well. <br>
Harry and Draco are brothers. Maybe I’d just seen the real Harry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“The Reaver line is exclusively girls. There has only been one Reaver that wasn’t an orphan, and that is the last Reaver on record, Mei Keang. Again no reason has ever been found for this. Reavers only ever have brothers.”<br>
How could I be a Reaver? I wasn’t anything like this. I had parents, both of them, and no brothers. No one was stalking me and recording my life. Unless…<br>
I ran for the study, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Slaying the Reaver</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> lying forgotten on the gym bench. <br>
I tore open Dad’s filing cabinet and flicked to A. Nothing.<br>
G. Nothing.<br>
M. Nothing. <br>
R. Reaver. There was a thick file, and I turned to a page dated only six months ago.<br>
“I’ve done all the research needed. I’ve tried convincing myelf over and over that it isn’t so and that I’ve made a mistake. But there is no doubt in my mind now that Allegra is the Reaver. She fits all the criteria. An orphan with only brothers and dark lineage. If Voldemort isn’t dark lineage then tell me who is?”<br>
The file slipped to the floor from my hands.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>i feel like the house i’ve lived in all my life is burning down before me.<br>

<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mum!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Allegra’s scream sliced through the silent night, and Harry and I simultaneously leapt to our feet and ran inside.<br>
“What is it?” Harry panted. “What is it?”<br>
Allegra was half running, half falling down the stairs. Hermione had come out to see what was going on.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Liars!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“Allegra-&quot;<br>
“Don’t talk to me!” she screamed. Draco appeared behind her, holding a thick black folder. <br>
“Allegra, did you go into my file drawer?” he demanded. She didn’t even glance at him.<br>
He was thrown backwards into the wall. Hermione gasped and went to run up the stairs to get to him. She got as far as the second step before she was sent flying, crashing into a painting on the wall. She fell limply to the ground. Harry went to step forward, but I threw my arm out to stop him.<br>
“Don’t.”<br>
She hadn’t moved from the stairs. She looked wild, feral. Angry.<br>
“She’s got to get a leash on that anger,” he muttered. “How do we help her?”<br>
“You’re asking me? I think she just killed her parents! There is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>no</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> management with that anger!”<br>
“They’re not my parents!”<br>
Her eyes flashed black, but resumed their normal brown in the same instant. The power radiating off her crackled in the air like static.<br>
“Allie…” Hermione groaned. “Stop…”<br>
“I recognise that hole!”<br>
The same black hole in the attic that day was appearing above Allegra’s head.<br>
“Allegra, get a grip!” I shouted.  “You’ll bloody well kill us all!”<br>
“I’d kill me too! And that’s what you want, isn’t it? The Reaver dead?”<br>
“How does she-&quot;<br>
“Dumbledore told her,” Draco said, standing up slowly, hissing in air through his teeth as some hidden damage pained him.<br>
“Oh, Allie.”<br>
“Oh, no!”<br>
Harry glanced up. There above us were those stupid little Draco things. <br>
“Dammit, no!”<br>
One swooped down on Hermione, and she screamed as it bit into her.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hermione!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Her scream faded away and her eyes rolled up to white. Draco cried out and tried to run to her, but a shield the purple of an ugly bruise popped up in front of him. He ran into it and it tossed him away. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The bite is fatal!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> He shouted to me desperately. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You have to get to her before…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I know!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I yelled back. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I know!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Allegra, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>stop!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“Who am I?” she sobbed. The hole grew bigger. “Why did you lie to me?” <br>
Unbelievably, Hermione was still alive. <br>
“Because you couldn’t handle the truth. Look at you now,” she rasped. “You’re not proving anything other than your lack of self control. Allegra, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>get a hold on yourself!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Her eyes fluttered shut, and Allegra squeezed hers closed.<br>
“I just want the truth,” I heard her whisper. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“I just want the truth.”<br>
Silently the hole closed. The bat that was biting my mother turned to dust, like all the others. The wound on her neck kept on bleeding. Kat and Harry stared at me disbelievingly, until finally Kat snapped out of it and went to help Mum. <br>
Hermione.<br>
“No, we’re not your parents,” Dad – Draco – said weakly. The barrier was down but he didn’t attempt to move. “Your parents are long dead.”<br>
He said it with no emotion.<br>
“Who were they?”<br>
“Cho Chang and Vol-&quot;<br>
“Cedric,” Harry interrupted hastily. “Cho Chang and Cedric Diggory.”<br>
“How did they die?”<br>
Everyone in the room hesitated. I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>felt</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it. <br>
“A man killed them years ago, on your first birthday.”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The fire grows behind her, and she can feel it swelling in the room, heat searing her, yet leaving her untouched.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“They were good people. They died to save you.”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The screams from behind, screams the others will never know because they weren’t there, weren’t there to smell burning flesh. Weren’t there to hear death screams.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“You look like Cho. Didn’t you ever notice how you don’t look anything like Hermione? Sure, Draco. But not Hermione.”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Her mother telling her to run. Run baby, she says. Then it’s all fire and death, but not for her. Not like it should be.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“Your parents did a fine thing for you, Allegra. You can think you’re the evil Reaver all you like. But that would mean your parents died in vain. They died for the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>good</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you. You are good.”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Except the past and the present collides and fire explodes, hot and red and burning, sweeping through the room, leaving not one untouched.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Pain, white-hot, seared my body and I writhed in agony. Oh, God, let it end! Every fibre of my being screamed for release, but there was none. <br>
But the dark was cool.<br>
“Kat. Come here.”<br>
“No,” I moaned.<br>
“Kat. Please. It’s good here. Safe. You won’t have to worry about anything anymore.”<br>
“I won’t…”<br>
But it was oh so tempting, that cold blackness, where my brother’s voice called to me.<br>
“Please, Kat. It won’t hurt. I promise.”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” <br>
The dark faded, leaving light in it’s place, but light that offered no relief.<br>
“I-I’m sorry,” Allegra stuttered. I couldn’t see her. Could only hear her voice full of regret and worse, unsaid angry words. “I didn’t mean to.”<br>
No one replied. The air grew heavy and I felt as though I was suffocating. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Don’t be dead. Don’t be dead.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
The pain got steadily worse. Something crashed to the floor around me. The house was falling apart.<br>
“Allie,” I said hoarsely. “Allie…” My voice grew stronger. “Allie, get out of here!”<br>
“No!”<br>
“Please…”<br>
Fire. I could smell the smoke. The fire was still burning somewhere.<br>
“I hate this!” she screeched. “I hate this!”<br>
“Then stop.”<br>
Harry’s voice. Water soothing my burnt skin. He was alive.<br>
“Uncle Harry, I just wanted to know.”<br>
“I know. But now you need to get out.”<br>
Where was he? And Hermione? I reached out, inhaling sharply when the burns on my skin stretched as I moved. <br>
“Allegra. You have the power to stop this.”<br>
Not so reassuring, but beautiful nonetheless. Draco must have been better than the rest of us if he could shout that loud. My fingers closed on Hermione’s jumper. As slowly as possible I sat up. Allegra stood still on the stairs, dirt streaking her face, mixed with blood and tears. <br>
“Stop this? How do I go back and reverse it?” she asked bitterly. <br>
“There isn’t any way to do that. But you can stop this from happening again. Just calm down.”<br>
I could see Draco now. He was standing up and moved to Allegra.<br>
“Daddy?”<br>
He embraced her and she started crying again. <br>
“I’m really sorry,” she whispered. “I really am.”<br>
“I know sweetheart.”<br>
Hermione’s eyes opened. “Wha…what happened?”<br>
“Reaver groove,” I told her, wincing as the pain shot through me again. The wound on her neck was bleeding slower now, and she put her fingers to it to stop the blood flow altogether. <br>
“You’re hurt,” she said.<br>
“Burnt. So are you.”<br>
“I didn’t mean to,” Allegra repeated.<br>
The house was in ruins again. The stairs were moments away from collapsing, and Draco started moving her off them quickly. The walls were blackened lumps. I could see right above me to the sky. <br>
“Some fireball,” I commented. “Burnt the lot. When you do something, you do it right.”<br>
“I can fix some of this.”<br>
Hermione got out her wand and muttered some words. Her own wounds healed, then mine, then Harry’s. Finally so did Draco and Allegra’s. The pain gone, I stood up.<br>
“We have to get out. The place is probably going to collapse any second.”<br>
The others followed as I stepped over rubble. When we were outside we just stood there staring at the ruins.<br>
“I can’t rebuild this again.”<br>
“Again?” Allegra asked, confused.<br>
“An earthquake destroyed it.”<br>
“The same one that killed your parents?”<br>
He nodded and held her tight. <br>
“I’m confused,” I said. “What really happened? I remember some fire. That’s it.”<br>
“I think she was remembering what happened that day with Cho and Cedric.”<br>
“Of course. The fire.” I understood.<br>
It pained me, but I understood.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Yawning, I stretched out. The sun shone down on me and I felt warm and sleepy. The blanket got heavy and I kicked it off.<br>
“Allie…”<br>
Mum’s voice pierced my half asleep brain. Too late for sleep now, my brain had started the day whether I liked it or not.<br>
Then I remembered.<br>
“Happy birthday!”<br>
“Birthday,” I said sleepily. “Yes. It is.”<br>
“Here, hon.”<br>
Dad handed me something bulky, gift-wrapped.<br>
“Smell of pancakes and presents luring you from your bed?” Mum joked.<br>
“Mmm,” I mumbled. “But-&quot;<br>
They glanced briefly at each other, and I didn’t miss the panic in their eyes. <br>
“Come on,” he said. “Let’s go have breakfast.”<br>
I glimpsed a teddy bear. A bear I’d lost when I was five, yet there it was, back on the end on my bed. <br>
“Allie?” Mum asked uncertainly. <br>
“I’m coming.”<br>
I swept my feet out of bed and followed them to the dining room. It was set out beautifully, with good china and everything.<br>
“Pancakes!”<br>
I felt like I hadn’t eaten for an eternity. After breakfast, and presents, I decided to go for a walk.<br>
“Allegra!”<br>
“Hi, Kat.”<br>
“What’s going on?”<br>
“It’s my birthday!”<br>
She looked confused. “Where’s Harry?”<br>
I stared at her. “In France. Playing Quidditch. You know that.”<br>
She sat down hard on the ground. “Repeat?”<br>
“Uncle Harry is in France playing Quidditch.”<br>
“France…” <br>
She turned around and stared at the house like she’d never seen it before.<br>
“But…the fire?”<br>
“Huh?”<br>
“There was a fire…”<br>
“Really?” Alarmed, I asked where.<br>
“Right here,” she replied, scratching her head in confusion. “Allegra. Are you going back to Hogwarts?”<br>
“Hogwarts?” I laughed. “I haven’t even started there yet.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I couldn’t speak. My mouth worked, trying to form words. <br>
It could not be possible.<br>
Finally, I got something coherent out.<br>
“Where are your parents?”<br>
“Inside.”<br>
The entire house had changed. It wasn’t a huge mansion. It was more like your average four bedroom place. What the hell was going on?<br>
I went inside and managed to follow voices until I came to a room where two people sat laughing about something.<br>
Oh, God.<br>
“Cho…Cedric?”<br>
They both turned.<br>
“Oh, hi Kat. Didn’t know you were here,” Cedric said amiably. A very much alive and breathing Cedric. Undeniably older, but Cedric anyway.<br>
“Run into Allie?” Cho asked. Dumbfounded, I nodded. “I think she needs to get her head through some things,” she continued confidentially. “Getting that broom has sent her into joy spasms.”<br>
“Broom…”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dammit, at least make some sense.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“How old is she turning?”<br>
Cho blinked. “Ten, of course. She’s only been going on about it for the past six months.”<br>
“Hermione?”<br>
“What?”<br>
“Hermione! Where is she?”<br>
“Somewhere off with Ron, I suspect,” Cedric said. <br>
“Ron’s alive?” <br>
“Isn’t he usually?” Cho said with a wry smile. “That boy’s off more than anyone I know.”<br>
A sudden warmth invaded my heart and I almost jumped up and down. A thought occurred to me.<br>
“Where are Aphrodesia and Aurora?”<br>
Cho glanced at Cedric worriedly. “Are you alright?” she asked. I nodded. <br>
“Just answer my question, please.”<br>
“Aurora’s dead, Kat. Remember?” <br>
Dead?<br>
“When…how?”<br>
“Kat, are you sure you’re feeling okay?”<br>
“I feel fine!” I snapped.<br>
“Aurora killed herself. And Aphrodesia’s in France with Harry.”<br>
I reached out a hand to steady myself. I was about to ask about Draco when-<br>
“Honey. Did you give our present to Allie?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“What is it?” I asked excitedly, shaking the gift back and forth. Draco laughed.<br>
“Open it, silly.”<br>
I did.<br>
“Oh, wow! A broomstick servicing kit!” I leapt up and hugged him and then Kat. Something was up with her. She looked tense. “Are you alright?”<br>
She recoiled. “I’m fine,” she replied tersely. I left it alone.<br>
“I thought maybe after you get dressed, we could maybe go out for lunch.”<br>
I didn’t miss the sly little smile Mum shot to Dad, but didn’t want to ask what it was about. I ran away upstairs to get changed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I checked my finger again. And there it was, winking up at me, light reflecting little rainbows onto the walls. <br>
A diamond wedding ring.<br>
I pried at it, trying to get it off, wondering if it would come off. <br>
“What are you doing?”<br>
“Nothing.”<br>
I hid my hand behind my back, then realised how stupid that was. I folded my hands sedately on my lap.<br>
“This might sound a little strange, but how long have we been married now?” I asked casually. He looked at me funny.<br>
“Going on four years.”<br>
Four…four years? But that means I can’t have left. So me leaving…<br>
Meant everything changing.<br>
Ron dying.<br>
Hermione marrying Draco.<br>
Aurora committing murder.<br>
But how were Cho and Cedric still alive?<br>
“Can you remember anything strange on Allegra’s first birthday?”<br>
“No, why?”<br>
“N-n-n-no reason,” I stammered. What else did I need to know…<br>
“How’s Fred and Angelina? And Aiden?”<br>
“They’re all fine.”<br>
Fine meant alive. Everyone that I cared about was alive. Except for maybe-<br>
“Hayden…”<br>
“I thought you didn’t like talking about him?”<br>
“I don’t? I mean, I don’t. I just wonder whatever happened to him.”<br>
He frowned. “Hayden died years ago. Are you honestly feeling alright? Maybe we need to go to St. Mungo’s or something…”<br>
“No,” I said hurriedly. “I’m fine.”<br>
My face broke out in a smile.<br>
“Just fine.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Comeoncomeoncomeoncomeon!” I raced down the hall and out into the drive. “Let’s go!”<br>
Dad came out, arms linked with Mum’s. I grinned and jumped into the car. <br>
“You have to wait anyway. Kat and Draco are coming. Kat’s the only one who can drive,” Mum said, nudging Dad with her elbow. The only reason we have a car is for appearance’s sake, or if we have to go somewhere we can’t get by Floo powder. Kat and Draco walked outside, Kat with sunglasses on. They all got in and we drove off, leaving the house in our dust.<br>
“So…” Kat said uncomfortably. She was acting so <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>weird.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> No one said anything. I wondered what was going on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The drive was silent, as were all the drives I seemed to go on here. I was too busy going over things in my head anyway, who was alive, and if it really was because of me.<br>
And if it could last, because frankly, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>this</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was everyone’s ideal existence.<br>
“Turn,” Cedric directed, interrupting my thoughts. I turned. <br>
“Ohhh,” Allegra breathed. We were passing by an exquisite garden, and I thought I could see tiny points of light dancing around. <br>
“Turn again.”<br>
Finally I pulled over and we piled out of the car. Cedric took the lead and we followed him. Draco slipped beside me and grabbed my hand. I tried not to pull away, remembering the events that had happened…only…they hadn’t. So I didn’t have a reason for fear, right? <br>
I gripped his hand tight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Uncle Harry!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” <br>
I tore past Dad into his arms. <br>
“Surprise!”<br>
“Kat was just asking about you!”<br>
“Was she now?” he asked, putting me down. He peered past me.<br>
“Hello, Kat. Draco.”<br>
“Harry.”<br>
“Hi, Harry.” <br>
“Happy birthday, Allegra.”<br>
I hadn’t seen her there, but she came out shyly behind Harry – Desia, his girlfriend. She looked sort of like Kat and Draco, which weirded me out no end. <br>
“Oh, faerie,” she smiled. She pulled one from my hair and showed me it. Fascinated, I bent down for a closer look. The tiny thing started preening and singing.<br>
“Show off,” I laughed. She flew away, annoyed. <br>
“Come have some lunch. We were waiting for you.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Tension between Harry and Draco may have the same, but something I saw made me forget about all that.<br>
More to the point, someone.<br>
“Hey, Kat!”<br>
“Oh, my God. Ron?”<br>
Older than I remembered him, but still the same basic guy. I almost fainted. <br>
“Hi, Kat.”<br>
Hermione was there too, gripping his arm like she’d never let go. That’s when I knew.<br>
“Hermione, can I talk to you for a minute?”<br>
She followed me, eyes never leaving Ron. <br>
“What is it?” she asked, distracted.<br>
“You know something’s wrong with this picture.”<br>
“What are you talking about?” She finally tore her eyes away from Ron. They grew impossibly wide. “Wrong?”<br>
“Please. Your eyes are never that wide open when you’re innocent.”<br>
“Alright,” she relented. “I don’t know what’s going on. But it’s wonderful, isn’t it?”<br>
“I won’t deny that. Everyone’s-&quot;<br>
“Alive. And together.”<br>
“Yes, but Hermione-&quot;<br>
“No buts. Kat, for one day, no buts. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He’s alive.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“And you can forget about the life you had?”<br>
She looked back at Ron. “For him I can forget it all.”<br>
Frustrated, I went back to the others.<br>
No, I couldn’t deny that this, this life, seemed like so much bliss. But whether it was right, I didn’t know.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Stuffed to the max, and content to just talk or wander slowly, the afternoon passed slowly, lazily. It was okay. It couldn’t go slow enough for me. I wanted it to go on forever. <br>
“So how does it feel?” Harry asked.<br>
“What?”<br>
“Why, double figures of course.”<br>
“It feels great!”<br>
“So let’s give that broom a whirl,” he grinned. I ran to get it from the car where Dad had thrown it in earlier. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“She’s happy.”<br>
“Why shouldn’t she be?” Draco asked.<br>
Because, I wanted to say, in another lifetime she’s doomed. And so are all of us unless we can work up the guts to kill her.<br>
Of course I didn’t say that. <br>
“She should be. She deserves it.”<br>
He didn’t reply. I cornered Hermione as soon as I got another chance.<br>
“Hermione, I want to stay as much as you do, but something here is very wrong!”<br>
Her eyes flashed angrily. “How do you know? Maybe we’ve just been given a second chance!”<br>
“By who? Who the hell would want to give us a second chance?”<br>
“Maybe because we stuffed up so badly the first time around!” she yelled. “And how can you say this is wrong?”<br>
A sound that was vaguely like a firework going off echoed in the silent air.<br>
“Oh, God,” Hermione whispered, eyes fixated on the suddenly dark sky.<br>
“Looks like we stuffed up second time round too,” I added grimly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I screamed as a hooded man pointed his wand at my parents. <br>
“No!” My mouth went dry. “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Avada Kedavra!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“Dammit! Cedric!” Kat came running. I couldn’t move, could hardly breathe. Kat darted for Mum.<br>
“Cho, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>run!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
It must have registered. Mum started running, as fast as she could, into the woods. <br>
But he was too fast.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Avada Kedavra!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
The rush of blinding green light and a scream from my mother. The glittering skull in the sky grew stronger and I felt sick. Mum and Dad, they were…<br>
“Allegra!” Draco grunted. “Get on your broom and go!” <br>
I was torn. I couldn’t go, not when my parents were-were-<br>
“Allegra, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>now!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” he thundered.<br>
I had no choice. It was fly or die.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I watched as Allegra flew off into the sky. Draco’s eyes met mine and he made a cradle with his hands. I knew what he wanted me to do.<br>
Airborne attack.<br>
I raced toward him, and as I jumped onto his hand he pushed upward. My own momentum propelled me towards the attacker, and I landed with an “ooph!” on his head. In a moment I had turned myself around so I was on his chest. Draco came forward and grabbed his wand.<br>
All too late.<br>
I broke his arm easily, not even wincing at the snap it made. He screamed. <br>
“Voldemort.”<br>
“Again,” Hermione sobbed. “Not again.”<br>
Cho and Cedric lay dead on the ground. Harry, Ron, and Desia stood to one side, in shock.<br>
“I told you,” I said to Hermione. “I told you we stuffed up. We have to get out of here.”<br>
“No…” she trailed off, looking at Ron.<br>
“You’ve seen them die again,” I said, jerking my head towards Cho and Cedric. “I’ll bet money Desia and Ron are going to as well. Want to see that happen?”<br>
“Kat,” Draco warned. Voldemort was struggling mightily. I placed two hands around his neck and pulled as sharply sideways as I could. <br>
The crack echoed. His head fell to one side limply. Neck broken. Dead. I stood up.<br>
“We have to find a way out of here.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I could barely see but somehow I made it home. <br>
The first thing I did was go for my parents’ magick books in the study.<br>
“Time reversal,” I prayed, fighting back tears. “Or bringing back the dead. Please.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“We have to go back to Cho and Cedric’s. Allegra’s liable to do something stupid in her state.”<br>
I agreed and we all got in the car. <br>
On the way, I explained some things to the others.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There was nothing. I started tearing apart the stupid books, the stupid, useless books that wouldn’t bring my parents back-<br>
“Allie!”<br>
Draco burst into the room. I spun around, heart thumping, and he came and hugged me, effectively stopping me from ripping up any more books.<br>
“Okay, so we’re looking for anything on time – oh. Or not.” Kat looked disappointed. “Ah, well. Hermione, get your smart on. We have work to do.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Draco and Desia steered Allegra gently from the room, and Harry, Ron, Hermione and I set about searching through the undamaged books.<br>
“Like old times,” Hermione whispered to me. “You want to leave this?”<br>
“You want to go through Ron’s death again?”<br>
She silently resumed looking through the books again.<br>
“Here,” Harry said, shoving a book into my hands. <br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Time Traveller’s Guide: Getting Back.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Perfect.”<br>
I flicked through the book. Unbelievably, there was a page marked “Press here for own time.”<br>
“Hermione. Here.”<br>
She came over and glanced down at the book. <br>
“Is that for real?”<br>
“It looks legit.”<br>
“It can’t be this easy.”<br>
“Let’s do this.”<br>
At the same time we plunged our hands into the paper. <br>
And nothing happened.<br>
“What’s going on?” I shook the book angrily. “Come on, you piece of crap!”<br>
“Maybe we’re meant to stay here,” Hermione volunteered hopefully.<br>
“We’re not. Something else is causing this.”<br>
“Um, guys?” Ron said, a slight tremble in his voice. He was standing by the window. “I’ve been here lots of times, and you know what I’ve never noticed?”<br>
We all moved beside him.<br>
“A gaping hole?” I offered.<br>
“A bloody big gaping hole,” he agreed. <br>
There, swirling madly in the middle of the grass, was a huge black hole. <br>
“Home?” I asked Hermione. She looked doubtful. Scared.<br>
“Suppose so.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allie, I know it hurts, but it’s okay.”<br>
“How?” I screamed. “How is it okay?”<br>
He looked helpless, and glanced at Aphrodesia. She shrugged. Kat, Harry, Hermione, and Ron came running out and into the garden. <br>
“Come on.”<br>
They dragged me out with them. <br>
“What’s that?”<br>
“That’s our way back,” Kat said, face set with determination. I wondered what she meant.<br>
“Wait…” A glimmer of hope appeared. “Are you going to bring my parents back?”<br>
I thought she said “if this goes right, you won’t even remember.”<br>
But I can’t be sure.<br>
Hermione and Ron hugged. <br>
“I’ll always remember you,” he whispered into her hair. She shook her head tearfully.<br>
“No, you won’t. You’ll be gone. But it’s alright.”<br>
“No,” he replied firmly. “I’ll never forget. I’ll never forget. I’ll never forget. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I’ll never forget.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
She could only shake her head again. <br>
With that, Kat grabbed Hermione and pulled them both down the hole and my world turned black.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Hermione?”<br>
“I’m alright.”<br>
The house was a blackened ruin again, and we were outside on the grass. <br>
Allegra, Draco and Harry were sleeping peacefully. I resisted the urge to shout and hug them all.<br>
“Do you realise what you just made me give up?” she said shakily. <br>
“Hermione…”<br>
“No. I just about had it all back. I had Ron. You had Draco. Harry had Desia. So why Kat, why did you make me come back here?”<br>
I tried to find an answer. “Because…”<br>
“You don’t have a reason.”<br>
Her voice was full of venom. Every word cut into me, and I winced from the sudden pain of it all.<br>
“You pulled me away and you don’t even have a reason.”<br>
<br>
Hey guys...CUT!'s up next lol!<br>

<br>
I woke up slowly. I’d been having the best dream, except…it wasn’t. I woke up to screams ringing in my ears. I brushed away the unpleasant feelings.<br>
“Halloween!”<br>
Despite the fact I’d burnt my house down, I felt happy. Kat and Mum were already awake.<br>
“What?”<br>
“She’s right,” Mum said slowly. “It’s Halloween.”<br>
“October 31st already?” Dad sat up. He had grass in his hair. “Let’s party.”<br>
“In what? If you haven’t noticed, the house is sort of burnt.”<br>
“Kat’s right. What do we do now? We haven’t even got a house anymore.”<br>
“So we go to the holiday house.”<br>
“You have a holiday house?” asked Kat incredulously. Dad nodded.<br>
“Who doesn’t?”<br>
“Me, for one,” she muttered. “Okay, so let’s go.”<br>
“We’ll have to Apparate.”<br>
“But Allegra…” Mum said worriedly. I waved my hand flippantly.<br>
“Don’t worry, Mum. I’ve done it all before.”<br>
“Draco-&quot;<br>
“Let’s go!”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“It’s not much, but it looks like home.”<br>
It looked like the home I’d been in only hours – or a year, really – before. Hermione must have noticed, because her breathing became highly audible.<br>
“It’s not burnt, anyway,” Harry said. <br>
“Point me to the rooms.”<br>
After we were settled in – Allegra was the only one with her own room, the rest of us were sharing – we were pretty quiet. <br>
“Did you say something?” <br>
I snorted. “Lame, lame, lame, Harry.” <br>
Hermione yawned. “I might go-&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bingbong! Bingbong!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I started laughing. “Oh, that is classic. You have an airport doorbell.” Allegra jumped up and ran for it, and I followed out of curiosity. She threw it open.<br>
And screamed her head off. Unimpressed, I asked, “Who called room service and ordered the walking dead? Cos I gotta tell ya, not so scary as mentally challenged, buddy.”<br>
“What?”<br>
Hermione joined us. There on the doorstep, groaning like some unoriginal horror flick reject, stood this tall green sewn together <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>thing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. I couldn’t help but giggle.<br>
That was until it started coming inside.<br>
“Whoa!” I protested. “What the hell do you think-&quot;<br>
“Kat, that’s a bloody zombie!” Hermione shrieked as she retreated further inside, shielding Allegra.<br>
“Zombie? Hermione, it’s someone in a bad getup. Look.”<br>
I poked the thing in its ribs. It raised it’s arms above its head and brought them crashing down down towards me.<br>
“Fat chance!” I said as I sidestepped. “Outside!”<br>
It continued to moan and shuffle towards me. Harry and Draco came to see what was going on.<br>
“Um, she’s right, that is a zombie.”<br>
I did a quick double take. “Okay. So…run?”<br>
“Oh, yeah.”<br>
We bolted, going in opposite ways. I heard Allegra scream, then the smashing of a window.<br>
“Zombie, zombie, zombie…”<br>
“We know what they are, Hermione!” I yelled.<br>
“I’m trying to work – decapitation!”<br>
“Oh, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>excellent.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I knew Buffy was going to come in handy.”<br>
I started searching the room for anything suitably sharp. <br>
“Kat!” Draco threw me an axe.<br>
“You know, I don’t even want to know why you’ve got this lying around.” <br>
He and Harry both had one, and we marched around the house. They’d taken out two, including the one that had smashed the window.<br>
“Anyone want to tell me why zombies are walking around in broad daylight?”<br>
“Halloween,” Harry offered as he chopped one’s head off. “Spell, maybe.”<br>
I groaned. “Does zombie blood wash out?”<br>
“Zombies have blood?”<br>
“Kat, look out!”<br>
I ducked as one of the stupid things swung a chair at my head. Immediately I swung the axe at its head, managing to get a clean sweep through. With a wet crunch the zombie’s head fell to the floor.<br>
“Ugh.” I danced away from it, swinging the axe in my hands still. Accidently I got another one in the chest. It stared at the axe buried deep blankly, then yanked it out with me still hanging on. I flew back into the wall. As quickly as I was down I was up and throwing the axe around. <br>
“One, two, three victims! Mwahaha!” I said in my best Count impersonation. “Wait. By any chance, does Dracula exist?”<br>
“More concerned with the zombies!”<br>
“Ohhh…right.”<br>
The flow seemed to slowing. The floor was littered with headless bodies, and of course the heads themselves. The stench was growing. Sadly it’s kind of impossible to heft an axe at a zombie’s head and hold your nose at the same time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I could hear bone crunching. I prayed that this wasn’t somehow my doing, bringing zombies here-<br>
“Allie! Here!”<br>
Mum gave me an axe and I took it. It felt surprisingly light.<br>
“Cut their heads off, there’s a good girl. I’m looking for the deactivator spell.”<br>
I did as she said. It was quite a way for me to reach, to get right up there and chop their heads clean off, but I managed. <br>
Finally, they stopped coming. All the zombie parts littering the floor turned to dust.<br>
“Self cleaning zombies. What? No pine-fresh scent?” <br>
“I work with what I’ve got,” Mum retorted. “And right now that’s not a lot.”<br>
“Least they’re gone. For now. Right?” I asked hopefully. <br>
“Not for long.”<br>
Harry pointed to the wall.<br>
“It’s coming. Gee. Original.” Kat rolled her eyes. “It’s even written in corn syrup, just like in the movies.”<br>
“That’s blood,” Dad corrected. “Too thick for corn syrup.”<br>
Kat shuddered. “Again, don’t even want to know.”<br>
“I just want to know what it’s doing there.”<br>
It was my turn to shudder. “I don’t. Really.” Yet my eyes were drawn to the message scrawled messily on the wall.<br>
“Just a suggestion, Allie,” Kat piped up. “Next time the doorbells rings, you’d do well to not answer it.”<br>
“Yeah.”<br>
“So back to the why,” Dad interrupted.<br>
“You’ve got as good an idea as me. Maybe we should leave?” Mum said.<br>
“No. They’re not driving us out.”<br>
“Anyway, what else can come during the day? Werewolves. You had axes, you must have a silver bullet somewhere. Witches-&quot;<br>
“Kat!”<br>
“Oh, yeah. Never mind.”<br>
“Hold on,” Harry said suddenly. “Movies…halloween? Halloween means horror movies.”<br>
And the light went on.<br>
“Oh, boy. Of course! Okay,” Kat said excitedly. “We’ve got zombies and the cryptic message. I figure before night falls we’ll get some demons, maybe a ghost or two, a werewolf.”<br>
“Werewolf?”<br>
“Don’t worry, Allie. I’m sure the zombie thing was just a one off – Kat, behind you!”<br>
Kat whipped around, axe in hands, and hacked off the zombie’s head. <br>
“I thought you got rid of those!” she shouted angrily. Mum didn’t reply. As soon the zombie hit the ground it turned to dust.<br>
“What about vampires?”<br>
“That’ll be fine, just don’t invite anyone in.”<br>
Kat got that look that means she’s just had some kind of thought.<br>
Not necessarily a good one.<br>
“Horror movies…there’s your monsters, demons and the like…but then there’s slashers.”<br>
“Slashers?” Mum’s eyes got wide. “Killers?”<br>
“One and the same.”<br>
I inched closer to Dad.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“I’m thinking bolt and lock everything that’s not.”<br>
“Done and done,” Harry said, taking Allegra by the hand. She trailed after him reluctantly.<br>
“So what else can we do?”<br>
Draco and Hermione turned to me expectantly. <br>
“Please. I’m supposed to know?”<br>
“Well, you know all about horror movies.”<br>
I sighed. “Look. Let’s hope Harry’s not right about that. Because if he is we’re in for a hell of a night.”<br>
“Yeah, but we’ve got most of the things we need,” Draco argued. “Don’t we?”<br>
Hermione shrugged. “Don’t ask me.”<br>
“We just have to be on guard. And we’ll have to stick together. And we also have to hope this thing won’t go past Halloween. What’s the time?”<br>
He told me.<br>
“It’s not too long.”<br>
“And if goes past Halloween?” Hermione asked.<br>
“Then? Then we leave. We run like hell and hope they don’t follow.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I followed Uncle Harry as he locked everything up.<br>
“Are you scared?” he asked me.<br>
“Yes.”<br>
“It’s alright. It’s probably just someone messing around with voodoo. Happens all the time.”<br>
“Really?”<br>
“I don’t know.”<br>
I waited a bit before talking again. “Can we handle them all?”<br>
“I’m sure we can. Kat watches Buffy.”<br>
“How would that help?”<br>
He smiled to himself. “In a lot of ways. You’ll see.”<br>
Still not satisfied, I opened my mouth to ask something else.<br>
Something flew in and filled me with cold, black liquid.<br>
The scream echoed off the walls.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allegra!”<br>
We ran to Harry and Allegra. <br>
“What happened?”<br>
Allie was lying on the floor, eyes open, staring glassily at the ceiling. Except her eyes were red. Her body twitched now and again, like minor spasms. My mind whizzed through all the horror flicks I’d seen.<br>
“Guys, if this is what I think it is, we’re in trouble.”<br>
“What?” Hermione panicked. “What do you think it is?”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Excorcist.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Bad, bad movie. Even the priests died.”<br>
“You think she’s <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>possessed?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Hermione went to take Allegra in her arms.<br>
“No, Hermione-&quot;<br>
“Hello, Mother.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I smiled lazily up at her and she screamed.<br>
“Oh, now why’d you do that?” I asked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mum! Help me!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“Now I have a headache. You know, I tend to get a little cranky when I have a headache.”<br>
“Please,” said the blonde woman, tossing her hair over her shoulder. “Scream baddie all you like, pet. Truth is we’ve faced kittens scarier than you. Sharper too. Now get out of her body.”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Yeah! Out! Right now!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I roared with anger. The woman sighed and waved her hand in front of her face.<br>
“Geez, your teeth need scrubbing. Starting two decades ago.”<br>
“If you’re trying to make me angry, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>it’s working!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That’s right, Kat! Goad it right out of me!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“Shut up!” I barked at myself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Make me!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I screamed and started banging my head on the floor. The four jumped on me, to stop causing any further damage.<br>
“Let me go!” I screamed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Don’t!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“Shut up! This is my body now! Mine!”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No it’s not! I cast you out, with the strength of those who love me! I cast you out with the strength of those who have passed before me! I cast you out with the strength that is my own!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
As I was expelled from the body, I spat out some last words.<br>
“It’s coming!”<br>
“Yeah, yeah,” the blonde one said, sounding bored. “We’ve heard it.”<br>
 <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Allegra sat up like she was about to vomit, but she just coughed violently. Hermione went to get her a glass of water.<br>
“Are you alright?”<br>
“I’m fine,” she rasped. “Just…nauseous.”<br>
“Do you think that counts as one of our ghosts?” Harry asked.<br>
“I hope so.”<br>
Hermione screamed from the kitchen.<br>
“Oh, man. Can we not get a break?”<br>
“There’s blood!” she yelled. “From the tap!”<br>
And sure enough that was exactly what we found. Blood gushing from the cold water tap. Grossed out, I reached over and turned it off. It bubbled down the sink.<br>
“That’s really sick.”<br>
“At least you didn’t get a glassful before you realised!”<br>
Hermione dropped the glass into the sink where it shattered.<br>
“Okay, I vote for staying together,” Allegra said timidly. We all agreed and sat down at the table.<br>
“I feel exposed,” Hermione announced. <br>
“Hermione, kitchen utensils are our friend.” I handed her a spatula and a pot. Draco and Harry grabbed some knives and even Allegra got a large glass bowl from the cupboard.<br>
“Vampires won’t be a problem, anyway. As long as we don’t invite anyone in. Basic rule number one.”<br>
“So what else could there be?”<br>
“Short list? Werewolves. Murderers. Evil witches. Ghosts. Demons. Crazed supersoldiers. Hellgods from other dimensions, in which case we really need to hope we’re not holding a Key.”<br>
They stared at me, confused.<br>
“Never mind.”<br>
A bang sounded, coming from the door.<br>
“Allie, don’t answer that.”<br>
“Police! Open up!”<br>
Harry looked up. “Maybe they can help?”<br>
“Don’t be stupid.”<br>
So we sat and sat until we couldn’t sit anymore. Whoever was at the door kept up the banging. Draco stood up.<br>
“Hold on, I’m coming,” I said grudgingly. I picked up a pan. He eyed it doubtfully.<br>
“There aren’t any sharp knives left.”<br>
“And you didn’t think an axe would be better?”<br>
“I’m a fan of the pan.”<br>
“It’s your death.”<br>
“Thanks.”<br>
I picked up an axe as well.<br>
We went slowly to the door. He glanced back at me as we got to it, and I nodded and got my pan at the ready. The axe was standing right by my leg. Draco unlocked the door and threw it open.<br>
“Hayden?”<br>
“What’s going on?” my brother asked, confusion written all over his face.<br>
“About fifty bad horror movies. Weapon?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
When Kat and Dad brought Hayden in I nearly fainted dead away.<br>
“Is he another ghost?” Harry asked.<br>
Kat nudged Hayden and he doubled over.<br>
“He’s solid… but I guess so. So what are you doing here?”<br>
“Got me, I was perfectly fine and then <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>vroom</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I’m here banging at your door and yelling that I’m the coppers. Cos I knew that was the only way to get you to open up.”<br>
He showed no sign of knowing me. Not one. <br>
“Who’s this?” <br>
“That’s Allegra.”<br>
He stared at me blankly. Then recognition dawned. “Allegra! Hello!”<br>
Kat looked worried and glanced at me. I shrugged my shoulders. Maybe the dead have no long term memory.<br>
“Hi.”<br>
So…what he’d told me that time, then. It must have been a lie. Because he doesn’t remember and maybe it wasn’t even him. <br>
So I’m not going to save the world.  I really am just going to destroy it, like the Reaver I don’t want to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“What’s gone on so far?”<br>
“Zombies, a bloody message on the wall, possession, and blood from the tap.”<br>
“And Kat’s been spouting cheesy lines,” Harry added. “Just like horror movie people.”<br>
I turned to stare at him. “Can you even work a VCR?”<br>
“Well-&quot;<br>
“That’s a no. So shush.”<br>
“Wow,” Hayden said. “You’ve got a bad case of HMM.”<br>
“HMM?”<br>
“Horror Movie Mayhem. [Ed: or Hate Made Me lol!]”<br>
“That’s strange. I’ve never even heard of it!” <br>
“Just because you haven’t heard of it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist, Mione.”<br>
She mumbled something under her breath. I put my head in my hands.<br>
“Zombies, ghosts, messages and blood. Is it lunchtime yet?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I ran off to my room. The others didn’t even notice.<br>
It was a job to keep myself calm. I knew that I even got a little bit angry I could unleash all kinds of hell. Well. The kinds of hell we wouldn’t already be facing. Like zombies.<br>
I guess I really just needed to sort things out. Knowing that you’re going to be responsible for mass destruction is a pretty big thing to get your head around. <br>
Dad didn’t know, and I don’t think Mum did either, but I’d found a whole stack of books under my bed. Most of them world destruction related. I didn’t even have the guts to try and read them. Didn’t even want to touch them. But sooner or later I was bound to. So I picked sooner. <br>
I browsed through the titles. Some I knew – <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Slaying the Reaver</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, for one. I knew that all too well. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Nighttime.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I decided to finish reading that.<br>
Slight problem.<br>
When I opened the book, a girl materialised before me. She glowered at me. All I could do was try to close my mouth. <br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Who are you?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“Me?” I squeaked. Honestly. Like I was the one who’d randomly appeared in someone else’s room.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Yes, you!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“I’m…I’m Allegra.”<br>
She paused, sniffed at the air. “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The next Reaver. I thought you’d be older.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
I found my proper voice. “Hey! You were only twelve!”<br>
At this she laughed, a paper-thin brittle sound, something like leaves crunching. “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Were. Yes, I’m dead now, aren’t I?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
I looked at her defiantly. “For the past hundred years or so, yeah.”<br>
She shook her head. “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well, come on then.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“What?”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>It’s my job to show you times past. Maybe even times not yet passed.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Mei Keang, the dead Reaver, touched me. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Invaded</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> me.<br>
I barely heard my own scream.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allie.”<br>
“Not again,” I groaned. “What is it this time?”<br>
“Maybe a werewolf,” Hayden said as we got up.<br>
“It’s not even the full moon!”<br>
Hayden snorted. “Snape’s probably out there somewhere bending over.”<br>
I started laughing and Hermione stared at us both like we were crazy. I shut up.<br>
“Do you have your pan?” Draco whispered loudly. I waved it enthusiastically.<br>
“Careful,” Harry warned. I lowered my pan.<br>
As we busted into Allegra’s room, all we found was her sleeping peacefully. Draco approached her carefully and shook her. Her eyes fluttered open.<br>
“Honey? Are you alright?”<br>
“I’m fine.” She smiled strangely. “Just fine.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Time flies backwards. The hands of a clock she can’t see spin madly, the wrong way, throwing her through history, the history of her own. Own line of what she is. <br>

Despite her inhuman strengths they catch her easily, as though she were prey. And she is. Prey for the ones who must kill her while what remains of her family stand by. Her parents were killed, she remembers. Killed for creating a monstrosity such as herself and dooming this world and their daughter. <br>

<br>
Allegra followed us meekly back into the kitchen.<br>
“Oh, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>crap.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
I halted to a stop. Draco bumped into me.<br>
“That wasn’t there before,” Hermione said.<br>
There was a TV and video sitting where the table had been. There was a huge Post-it saying “Press Play”. I obeyed and we crowded around to see what was going on.<br>
“Hello!”<br>
There was a vague human-like shape on the TV, but it was so fuzzy I couldn’t see who it was. The voice was a man’s though.<br>
“I hope you’re having fun playing this game! I tell you, the forces of darkness sure are. We have so many surprises in store for you. And in case you haven’t worked it out yet, no one is safe. In fact, you may want to do a quick head count…don’t want anyone to lose theirs now, do you?”<br>
I was the first to whip around and see who was missing.<br>
My throat got tight.<br>
“Harry. Where’s Harry?”<br>
The others looked around them and I double checked. Draco, Allie, Hayden, and Hermione. Harry was gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And she goes forward again.<br>
She sees through the Reaver’s eyes this time, feels the pull of the dark, feels the way it tugs her soul. Sees horrors beyond her own imagination caused by her.<br>

Forward. Again she sees through the eyes of another.<br>
Pain shoots through her stomach, shaking her down to her bones. She looks up. Her brother stands there, his eyes crazed and yet full of sorrow. There’s an axe in her stomach, and she stares at it blindly, not really seeing. He yanks it out, swings it towards her head. She feels nothing as she dies except for relief. If she could thank her brother she would. He saved her. Damned her, but saved her.<br>
But she’s thrown faster now, right into the body of a Reaver in the 1700s, a Reaver burnt for a witch. Her family did it this time. Ties her to a strong wooden pole and lies wood all around her. Her uncle sets the lot on fire. It goes up in a whoosh. She feels no pain. No regret. What she sees as she dies is her family, dead on the ground around her.<br>
What they see as they die is darkness, the darkness that the Reaver cloaks them in, choking them.<br>
A hundred years later it happens again. Innocent blood is spilled, and it runs together with the evil. The Reaver laughs madly as she dances away from her would-be killers, the very things she brought to earth herself.

<br>
We ran around the house calling his name. <br>
The worst feeling came when I found a blood trail leading to the bathroom.<br>
No one spoke as we advanced on the bathroom, weapons at the ready. Hayden rushed in front of us, mouthing that he was already dead, so he should go in first. When he got in there, he yelled for us to come in.<br>
“Kat, you’re going to love this!”<br>
Curious, I went in. Hayden stood in front of a terrified Harry and a man dressed in a cloak. Now there’s a mirror in the bathroom; see where I’m leading with this?<br>
The man had no reflection.<br>
Harry appeared to be fine.<br>
“How the hell did you get in?”<br>
Something whispered in my head.<br>
“Draco, who does this house belong to?”<br>
“Us, of course.”<br>
“You didn’t…inherit it?”<br>
“Well, it was my father’s.”<br>
“Was? Or still is? Is it under your name?”<br>
“No-&quot;<br>
I clapped a hand to my forehead and swore. “Dammit, Draco! Your parents are the owners of the house! Your parents are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>dead!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“I know that-&quot;<br>
“They’re dead! Vampires can get in here, because the owners of the house are dead and they don’t need an invitation! How could you be so <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>stupid?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
He didn’t say anything. I wished I had an axe. No one in the room moved, not even the laughing man who had Harry in his grip. I leaned against the door.<br>
The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wooden</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> door!<br>
“Oh, that is too good,” I said out loud. Motioning for Hermione to move, I kicked the door shut then kicked again, as hard I could. The door splintered easily. Draco caught on and snatched up wood from the ground, throwing some to Hermione. I got the biggest piece and ran for the vampire. He spun Harry away from him, and he flew into Hayden. They tumbled to the ground. <br>
It was on. <br>
“You think you can defeat me?” he laughed.<br>
“Please. Where’d you get that accent? Sesame Street?”<br>
I kicked out, and got him in the stomach. He hit me back, trying to get me in the throat, but he was pretty slow. I threw a punch, catching him under his chin. He stumbled back and hit the bath. I took my chance and leapt on top of him. Laughing, I buried the stake in his chest.<br>
“It’s com-&quot;<br>
He was dust. <br>
“Coming. Yeah. I know.”<br>
I stood up and dusted off my hands. The others stood in a kind of shocked silence.<br>
“What?” I asked nonchalantly.<br>

<br>
Back in the kitchen again. Nothing was going to get the dust out of my hair.<br>
“So we have to be extra careful,” Hermione intoned. “If what Kat’s saying is true.”<br>
“It is true. Got any garlic?”<br>
“Check the fridge.”<br>
I did so.<br>
“Ohhh…scentless garlic. Handy!”<br>
“Kat. That’s an onion.”<br>
I felt my face redden. “I knew that.”<br>
“Why don’t you nail crosses to all the doors or something?” Hayden suggested. “It would probably help. Bar the windows.”<br>
“It’s worth a go.”<br>
“Yeah, unless we’re barring ourselves in with a killer. Slasher, remember?”<br>
Hermione shuddered. “Yuck.”<br>
“With a side of ick,” I agreed. “But you can’t forget what we’re dealing with.”<br>
“Which is…?”<br>
“I don’t know. Horror movies and stuff.” I glanced out the window. “Okay, how the vamp got in here when it’s still pretty sunny outside I don’t know. But the sun is going.”<br>
“We humans must never fail to appreciate that big bright ball of fire,” Hayden chimed in solemnly.<br>
“Humans? Mate, you’re dead. Anyway, the sun’s leaving, so we need to get into the whole bar and cross thing. And anything else we can think of. Garlic at the door, silver bullets in guns-&quot;<br>
“Wands, too, perhaps?” Hermione said wryly, holding hers up. <br>
“Let’s go.”<br>
“Troops out!” Hayden commanded. We turned back to stare at him. <br>
“Sorry. Caught in the moment.”<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Falling…time is slowing, somehow speeding up too…falling through whatever it is the Last Reaver sent her into, barrelling through time and space. <br>
She sees herself being born. <br>
She sees her first birthday.<br>
She sees the good and the bad of her years. <br>
The train at Hogwarts, perhaps a glimpse of what she will one day become.<br>
The murder of her best friend at her own hands.<br>
The deep holes she herself tore in the fabric of the world. The holes that almost killed her family.<br>
But then it goes beyond.<br>
Another ball of fire. Maybe the sun. But no, because a Reaver’s purpose is to stop the sun from rising. None has ever succeeded.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
You, though. You’re different. You can stop it.<br>

She’ll tear apart your family. But she doesn’t have to.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Her mother has dried tears on her face, an expression of soul-shaking fear written on it. She sits alone, no one there for her anymore, because of the intruder.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
It doesn’t have to be like this. She’ll cause you trouble. Best to kill her. Do it now.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Allegra paused suddenly.<br>
“What’s up?” I asked her as I banged some nails into a wooden cross. <br>
“Noth-&quot;<br>
Her sentence was cut short.<br>
More bloody zombies!<br>
I didn’t even have an axe.<br>
“Dammit, nothing stays <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>dead</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> anymore!” I yelled, exasperated. I kicked it, and it stumbled back. “Rogue dead! Rogue dead!” I shouted at the top of my lungs. “Wait, on some level that was supposed to make sense…”<br>
“Yeah, well, the file named ‘logic’ is down right now,” Hayden said. Weaponless, he too could only use his body. Allegra seemed frozen.<br>
“Oh, Allie! You mind giving me a hand over here?”<br>
She jerked out of it. <br>
“Die, intruder!”<br>
With that, she walked away, leaving me there. Draco, Harry and Hermione had shown up by then. I was about to get my ass handed to me.<br>
“Ow!”<br>
A bloody vampire had me by the foot. It tore off my sneaker and threw it out the window.<br>
“Hey! These shoes are expensive! Way to piss me off!”<br>
I grabbed the cross I’d been hammering together and held it up in front of me.<br>
“This would be easier,” Harry said, handing me a makeshift stake. I grinned at him.<br>
“Thanks.”<br>
I stabbed the vampire in the chest, but missed my target. He laughed, even as I pulled it out and stabbed again.<br>
And missed again.<br>
“What the hell is going on?”<br>
Laughing uncontrollably now, he told me.<br>
“No heart, honey.”<br>
“Easily solved. Draco, axe!”<br>
A deft catch stopped my foot from being chopped off. However, no catch was going to stop me from shaving off the vamp’s head. He dusted while still laughing.<br>
The others will having a bit of good luck with the zombies. Most were on the floor.<br>
“I’d just like to say something,” Hayden said, surveying the mess. “I’m going to take a stand and say Halloween is no longer cool.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
After I left the room Mei extracted herself from my body. <br>
“Do you see now?” she asked, voice no longer thin and wispy. “Do you see how you can’t live?”<br>
I don’t think I’ll ever know how she did what she did next. She picked up a knife and slashed my palms.<br>
I cried out, tears springing to my eyes.<br>
Yet the sting took away some of the pain.<br>
I understood what Michael had said then, about the pain stemming from more than the outside.<br>
“That blood is tainted, like you. Reavers have no purpose other than raising…stopping…and dying.”<br>
“You’re wrong!”<br>
“Am I?” she replied. “Have you learned nothing this night? All the Reavers, their one end was death. No life to speak of. What do you think you have to live for that we didn’t?”<br>
“I have…” I trailed off. I couldn’t think of anything. My parents were dead. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dark lineage…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Voldemort…”<br>
A fearful look came upon Mei’s pale face. “He Who Must Not Be Named! You dare speak of him? Even we Reavers fear him!”<br>
I didn’t get it. “Voldemort was after your time.”<br>
“He Who Must Not Be Named is in every time, Reaver.”<br>
“But we’re just like him!”<br>
She shook her head fervently. “You are wrong. We have hearts. He is soulless.”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You’re</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wrong. Someone like that…he has a soul. Maybe even a heart.”<br>
“If he does have either they are cold and black, not worth thinking about.”<br>
I remembered my cut hands. The blood dripped to the floor.<br>
Was it a trick of the light, or was there a tinge of black in it?<br>
The hopelessness of the situation hit me. <br>
“You can’t live, where the rest of us couldn’t,” Mei hissed. “It wouldn’t be right.”<br>
My muddled thoughts slid into place.<br>
“What you’re saying,” I said slowly, “is that it wouldn’t be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fair.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Her face showed I’d hit my mark.<br>
“Fair?” she spat. “Of course it wouldn’t be fair. I was twelve. What makes you think you can live and experience all the things I couldn’t? I never fell in love. I never kissed a boy.”<br>
“Those aren’t the important things-&quot;<br>
“They are when you’re twelve! I never-I never got to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>live.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> And if you do, that’s not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fair.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Angry now, I said “Nothing ever is. Mei, you have issues. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>They are not my problem.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
She laughed bitterly. “Reaver, you don’t understand. If you live, you disrupt the balance.”<br>
“What balance? There’s good, and there’s evil. They’re never balanced. The good’s always going to win.”<br>
“If you live…if you live, the evil wins. Do you understand?”<br>
That had been drummed into my head over the time I’d spent out of my body. But I only just understood now. Just now, after all that time of thinking I understood.<br>
“You know nothing, little girl.”<br>
“I-&quot;<br>
“Nothing. The death of the Reaver has been and always will be. There is no other way.”<br>
“That you know of! But I can find it, I know it!”<br>
“Am I talking to myself?! You can’t! You will die like the rest of us!” She paused ominously. “And if you don’t…there will be people who will make sure you do.”<br>
She disappeared. My palms kept on bleeding, making me want to scream. The cuts were deep, I could see. Maybe too deep to fix…<br>
There’s a way out.<br>
“No!” I said aloud. I would find a way. It looked useless now, but it wouldn’t be forever.<br>
The intruder stuck her head in the door and hatred filled me quickly.<br>
“What do you want?” I snapped. <br>
“I…you know what? Never mind.”<br>
She had to die. I had to do whatever it took. <br>
Whatever it took, because she had to die.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
She looked pissed.<br>
So I did the right thing…and scampered in the other direction. You don’t mess with kids like Allie. Kids with that ‘time-bomb’ tendency. <br>
“What’s with her?” Hayden asked. “I heard her intruder bit.”<br>
“Me too. Who knows?” I tried to shrug it off easily. It didn’t work. Her words lay heavy on my mind. Intruder?<br>
“Uh-oh…”<br>
Hayden’s eyes met mine and we walked to the kitchen.<br>
“What-oh?”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
I groaned inwardly. There was a new video message. This time, I got smart. I stood behind everyone so I could keep an eye on them. Hermione hit play.<br>
“The game’s almost over here…but it’s only just beginning there! As of the start of this video, you have thirty – ohhhh, make that seventeen – seconds to run. Because what was coming…well. Everyone, have a nice death!”<br>
The video stopped. <br>
We froze, pretty much unable to move.<br>
“Run!” Draco yelled. <br>
“Where?”<br>
“Anywhere! Allie, come with me!”<br>
“No, I want to go with Kat.”<br>
No time to argue, nor think. She slipped her hand into mine and we ran with one of the two rooms with locks. I had a couple of seconds to realise that the males had gone one way, the females another. It sounded stupid, but when I’m in a panic I notice stupid things.<br>
I heard a bang and jumped. Hermione glanced at me fearfully.<br>
“What do we do?” I asked her.<br>
“I don’t know!” <br>
She twisted her hands frantically. <br>
“We can’t just hide! We’re sitting ducks here!”<br>
“Good point,” said Allegra thoughtfully. “Go fight.”<br>
And she propelled me out the door and slammed it shut. I heard the lock slide into place.<br>
Weaponless, freaked, and damn right <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>pissed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> at Allegra, I went to the kitchen to search for something sharp. Which is where things really just went from bad to goddamn apocalyptic. See, I have this fear of things with more than four legs. To me, it’s just not right. Ron, he shared my fear. <br>
But he would fainted away if he’d seen what was currently bursting out of the room. Hell, I’d fought zombies and vampires, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was about to faint away.<br>
I froze, hoping I wouldn’t attract its attention. Too late. <br>
Wildly I looked around the room. There was a knife lying on the bench, and okay, yeah, it was a butter knife, but it was better than me having to touch the bloody thing! Besides, its legs looked pretty weak. A swipe with the knife in the right place might be enough to take it down…<br>
“What do you think you’re doing?”<br>
“It…you…you talk!”<br>
“Of course I talk.”<br>
[Ed: Wohoo! 100 pages right here!] “But you’re-&quot;<br>
“Not your biggest concern. It’s coming.”<br>
“I’ve heard it! Care to tell me exactly what it is coming?”<br>
Amazingly, the spider thing seemed to consider it. “Actually, I’m hungry. So no.”<br>
It gnashed its teeth together and I felt my knees go weak. I didn’t know spiders had  that many very sharp, very long teeth. It came toward me menacingly and I brandished my knife, feeling like an idiot.<br>
Of course I’m an idiot who can fight, so fight I did. I was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> going to be chomped up by some whacked out spider…thing.<br>
I dived under it’s head, under the abdomen, and it tried valiantly to stick it’s head in between all its legs. As much as it grossed me out, I grabbed its head in my hands and pulled, sending the creature off balance. It flipped and I had to leap to avoid getting hit by furry limbs. Its legs scrabbled weakly in the air, trying to find some kind of leverage, and I kicked one of the legs, surprised to see it break off. Maybe this was going to easier than I thought.<br>
“I…am…not…dinner!” I huffed, impacting a kick with each word. I didn’t see the leg it sent my way though, sweeping me off my feet. It had somehow got right way up, and leaned over me, breath brushing my face. I tried not to breathe in.<br>
“Kat!”<br>
“Harry, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>help!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
He jumped onto the spider’s head, and it bucked wildly, trying to get him off. But Harry had his wand, unlike me, and used it to stab the spider in one of his eyes. It screamed as yellow-greenish fluid seeped from it – right onto me! I moved to wipe it off, wincing as the slimy liquid dripped to the floor. Harry stabbed it again, and I had the brains to scoot out of the way. A few more times and it crashed to the floor with an amazingly high screech. I shuddered.<br>
“Harry, do me a favour. Next time there’s a spider, and I say ‘There’s a spider, get rid of it?’”<br>
“Yeah?”<br>
“Just…get rid of it. Do what you have to, but don’t tell me what you do. I don’t <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>care</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> what you do, as long as I never have to step on one in my life.”<br>
“You’re assuming you’ll live through this,” he said grimly.<br>
“I will. We all will.”<br>
“So what movie was that from?”<br>
“Pfft. I don’t know. I don’t like spiders.”<br>
A very slow thought leaked through to my brain.<br>
“Horror movies…they always have two things.”<br>
“And?” he asked.<br>
“Well, there’s the villain, or the demon or spider thing or whatever…”<br>
“What are you getting at?”<br>
I couldn’t suppress my smile.<br>
“And there’s the hero. If we can get bad guys, who’s to say we won’t get good guys too?”<br>
“You’re assuming a bit much there too, aren’t you?”<br>
A window smashed somewhere in the house.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“What the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hell</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> did you do that for?” Mum shrieked. She gripped my shoulders and shook hard. “You could have just caused her death-&quot;<br>
“Like you care,” I snapped, sitting on my bed. I discreetly shoved <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Nighttime</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> off the bed so she wouldn’t see it. But she saw me.<br>
“I do care. She’s…she’s still my friend,” she admitted. She went round to the other side of the bed and picked up the book. I made no move to stop her. She would see things my way. I knew what she thought of the intruder.<br>
“Were you reading this?” she asked. I heard the panic and fear in her voice and nodded. <br>
“Why?”<br>
“It’s about someone like me, isn’t it?”<br>
“Mei Keang, she’s nothing like-&quot;<br>
“She’s a Reaver. She died, like I will.”<br>
“What do you know about Mei, Allie?”<br>
“I know that she wants to help me. Help us.”<br>
I saw suspicion flare in her eyes. “What?”<br>
“She wants to help me. By killing the intruder.”<br>
“Intruder…Kat?”<br>
I nodded again.<br>
“Kat’s not an intruder, Allegra.”<br>
“She doesn’t belong here!”<br>
“Have you met Mei Keang?”<br>
Her question caught me offguard. “Maybe.”<br>
“The truth, Allegra.”<br>
I shrugged. “Maybe.”<br>
She threw the book onto the floor. “Tell me!”<br>
I stooped to pick it up. She snatched it away from me.<br>
“Give it back!”<br>
“It’s not yours.”<br>
I felt my anger begin to grow.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That’s it. Don’t fight. This is how you will kill the intruder.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I didn’t fight it. I let it grow and grow and grow until the familiar black hole appeared in the ceiling.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Oh my God, what happened here?”<br>
Harry and I looked up in surprise. A blonde girl stood there, looking around her, wide-eyed.<br>
“Who’s that?”<br>
After rubbing my eyes vigourously to check that I wasn’t actually hallucinating, I barely contained my laughter. “That’s Buffy.”<br>
Only we didn’t get the TV Buffy. We got Kristy Swanson’s movie Buffy. You know. That really bad movie. Nothing looked right then. Okay, eighties or early nineties, but still. Come on.<br>
“What’s the problem?” she asked. “Did someone die?”<br>
“Not yet…and we’ve got some problems, yeah…but there are bigger ones right now.”<br>
Maybe he Apparated, or maybe it was some kind of ghost thing, but Hayden wound up in the pretty wrecked kitchen.<br>
“Guys,” he said urgently. “What was coming…it’s here.”<br>
“What? But…but Halloween’s nearly over, isn’t it?”<br>
None of us knew the time, so I could only hope that Halloween was almost over. But that meant my horror movie theories had to be right. Well, I’d been right on the hero count. We had Buffy standing around moaning about the goo on her shoes. I was a little confused on her account though. I mean, the big bad that was after sent us mini bads…and a heroine. Why? <br>
Unless…<br>
“Hey, Buffy,” I said, trying to sound calm. “How’s the slaying going?”<br>
She only stared back at me blankly. I groaned.<br>
“What?” Harry asked anxiously. “What?”<br>
“She’s Buffy without the Vampire Slayer at the end.”<br>
Hayden understood. “She hasn’t been chosen.”<br>
“We have an extremely useless heroine.”<br>
“Hey!” she protested. “I am not useless!”<br>
“You might be right if…” <br>
If I remembered my Buffology correctly, potential Slayers still displayed strengths far stronger than that of the average girl. When they were chosen, those powers got kicked up to full gear. Her slayer powers wouldn’t be in high drive, but in the few hours we had they’d have to do.<br>
“Idiot!” I yelled to the no one tormenting us. “She’s still got power!”<br>
“Okay, um, someone want to clue me in?”<br>
I started to speak, but Hayden stopped me. <br>
“Allow me,” he grinned. “See monster. See Buffy kick monster’s ass. That’s all you need to know.”<br>
She looked from him, to me, to Harry.<br>
“You people are strange.”<br>
“So what’s coming?” I asked Hayden, changing the subject. God knows I don’t need reminders of how weird my life is.<br>
“You know what.”<br>
“Now is not the time to be Mysterious Dead Boy on me, okay? What’s coming?!”<br>
“It’s here. It’s Allegra.”<br>
“I should have known.”<br>
Draco startled us all, including Buffy, whom he didn’t give a second glance.<br>
“She’s always going to be the source of it, isn’t she?” he asked, looking at Hayden, who didn’t reply.<br>
“Hermione’s in the room with her!”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I don’t know why Mum thought to do what she did. She snatched up the axe she’d brought with her and drove it home into the book. It seemed to…<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>scream.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
And just like that the black hole that had been in the process of opening closed. My knees collapsed and I crumpled to the ground. I saw the vague shimmery form of Mei hovering just behind my mother. <br>
“Mei,” Mum said, turning around. “What the hell do you think you’re doing to my daughter?”<br>
“Your daughter? What makes you think she is yours? She belongs to the dark.”<br>
“No, she doesn’t, and you’d do well to shut up and stop telling her such things!”<br>
Mei laughed. “Like a mother. Yet you’ve never even given birth to a child. But you will. You feel it within yourself. You will.”<br>
Mum looked confused and clutched her stomach. “What are you talking about?”<br>
“Everything happens for a reason,” Mei replied, sounding wise beyond her years. “Everything. You’ll see.”<br>
With that she evaporated into thin air. <br>
“Mum?” <br>
“It’s alright,” she said absently. I wondered what Mei had meant…<br>
But I had no time to wonder. Mum snatched my hand and pulled me down to the kitchen.  Kat, Dad, Uncle Harry, Hayden, and a girl I didn’t know were there, staring at us both.<br>
“Hermione, are you alright?”<br>
“Why wouldn’t I be?” she replied. Dad hugged her tight, then me. I felt tears prick my eyes. The three of us seemed to stand there for an eternity, until the girl cleared her throat awkwardly.<br>
“Yeah, sorry to interrupt the love in, but I got places to be people, so let’s keep it moving and I can leave.”<br>
“You’re not even real,” Kat said wearily. “So shut up.”<br>
“Who are you anyway?” Mum asked.<br>
“I’m Buffy. Pleased to meet ya,” she said, extending her hand.<br>
“She exists?” Mum looked to Kat.<br>
“Apparently so. But she’s not the cool TV version, she’s the crap movie one. On top of that she’s not been Chosen yet.”<br>
The distinct sound of a window smashing – a sound we’d come to know and hate – reached our ears.<br>
“What now?” Hayden moaned.<br>
“At least you’re already dead,” Kat shot as we moved out in the direction of the noise.<br>
“Just get your pan.”<br>
“Oh, good idea.”<br>
She slipped back to get it. “I’m right behind you!” she called. “Just…a little further back.”<br>
She caught up fast though. It turned out the smashed window was in my room, and as much as I didn’t want to go there, we had to. <br>
My heart almost stopped when I saw what was going on.<br>
Aiden was standing in the centre of the dark room. Only the light of the half moon brightened the room. Books were flying, my clothes were plastered to the walls which were dripping with blood. There was glass everywhere.<br>
“Aiden.”<br>
Hayden didn’t sound surprised.<br>
“You know him?” Kat asked.<br>
“Seen him around. One angry little fella, that boy.”<br>
I gripped the back of Dad’s jumper. “Dad, I don’t want to go in.”<br>
“Well, you can’t stay out here al – actually…Buffy. Look after Allie.” He shoved me into her. She dusted herself off and looked down at me disgustedly.<br>
“Kids,” she spat.<br>
“Teenagers,” I said back. But my heart wasn’t in it. It was there in that room. <br>
It was time to go and get it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Aiden, stop!”<br>
Draco sounded scared, and I couldn’t stop my laugh.<br>
“Like he’s gonna listen. You have to yell to get their attention.”<br>
“No you don’t.”<br>
Allegra walked in front of us and stood there, silently.<br>
“Allie, I thought you were…”<br>
“Shush,” Hermione whispered, eyes fixed on her daughter.<br>
“Aiden. Please stop.”<br>
There was a faint glow coming off him, and his eyes looked to be tinged with red. He turned and fixed Allegra with his gaze.<br>
“What do you want? You’ve already taken my life,” he snarled.<br>
You know that entire concept of time slowing down?<br>
Oh, boy. Snail’s pace right then. What he said took forever to process. <br>
“You killed him.”<br>
Hermione’s voice was strangely matter-of-fact. No denial, just sorrowful acceptance. Allegra looked back at us, tears in her eyes. She didn’t speak, and turned her attention back to Aiden.<br>
“I’m sorry.”<br>
A shard of glass flew from the ground and sliced her cheek. Hermione cried out and went to take a step toward her, but Draco held her back.<br>
“I’m sorry,” she repeated.<br>
A book collided with her head. Still she stood strong.<br>
“I’m sorry.”<br>
Invisible fingernails slashed cuts up her arms, and I noticed she had slower bleeding cuts on her palms.<br>
“I’m sorry.”<br>
Aiden waved his hands, and a dresser came crashing towards Allie. She waved her hands and it moved back into place. For a moment it was a mental tug-of-war, with the dresser being shoved back and forth.<br>
“I’m sorry!” Allegra cried. “I’m sorry!”<br>
“That’s enough!”<br>
Hayden’s voice rang out above the din. Aiden paused for just a second, but it was enough for Hayden to hurl himself into him. For some reason Aiden was solid, and they crashed to the ground. Hayden punched the boy in the face, and he went limp.<br>
Allegra stumbled over, blood slicking her arms and face. <br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Beepbeep! Beepbeep! Twelve, AM!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Allie leaned in close to Aiden.<br>
“Cut,” she whispered. “It’s over.”<br>
Hayden, Buffy, the mess in the room, and Aiden turned to dust before our eyes. Hermione and Draco took Allegra into their arms. Harry put his arm around me, and I fought back tears. <br>
“It’s over.”<br>
That illusion was shattered when the TV in the kitchen – it miraculously survived Attack of It – switched on. We went back to see what was going on.<br>
“Well, well, well. It’s the end of All Hallows’ Eve and you’re all here, alive and…breathing, anyway. Wasn’t this a fun evening? Not one of you can say this turned out for the best. You’ve got a murderer in your-&quot;<br>
It was cut off. Draco had swung a pan through the screen.<br>
“I dub thee, a fan of the pan,” I told him, feeling weariness seep through my bones.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yeah! All in one! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>INSANE WITH THE BUFFY LOVE</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
Dad had the house rebuilt over November. Obviously things like photos and mementoes collected over the years couldn’t be replaced…but having the house there helped. Also, three times’ the charm, Dad had said. Hopefully three times’ safe from harm, Kat had added. <br>
And seeing it all decorated for Christmas made me feel five. Excited and happy and impatient all at once, like I hadn’t felt for so long.<br>
“Well, it’s a big tree. I can’t wait to tell my friends. They haven’t got a tree this big.”<br>
I heard Dad’s exasperated sigh. “It has to be big. It’s a Christmas tree!”<br>
“Oh, really? I couldn’t guess with all the lights on it. Are you trying to set it on fire?”<br>
“Kat, leave him alone,” Mum chastised, as though she was talking to a four-year-old. “He’s proud of his…tree.”<br>
I walked into the room. The scent of pine nearly suffocated me and I started coughing.<br>
“Allie! Are you alright?”<br>
“Pine…overbearing…” I choked out. <br>
“I can fix that,” Mum said, never looking up from her book as she waved her wand. The smell gone, I went closer to the tree. The tiny lights winked at me incessantly, and the moving fairy at the top blew me a kiss, much to my horror.<br>
“What’d it do that for?!”<br>
“Too much brandy,” Dad muttered. I giggled. <br>
“So, one more day. Bursting?” Kat asked me. <br>
“I guess.”<br>
Christmas eve tomorrow…strange that. Plus after Christmas I suppose I’d have to go back to school. Which reminded me.<br>
“Dad, I need some more marnox root. For potions.”<br>
Mum glanced up at Dad, who raised his eyebrows. She shrugged and went back to her book.<br>
“Dad?”<br>
“I have something to tell you, Allie.”<br>
“There goes my exit cue,” Kat said as she left, grabbing Harry by the hand.<br>
“Your mother and I have decided you will attend Beauxbatons next term.”<br>
“Not me, Draco. You.”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“Well, considering the circumstances with Aiden-&quot;<br>
“He has got nothing to do with anything!”<br>
“Who else knows, Allie?”<br>
Resigned to tell him, I mumbled “Zeanna, Ty, Charisma and Josiah. Dumbledore.”<br>
“Zeanna?” Mum looked at me in disbelief. “Zeanna Wood?”<br>
“Yeah, why?”<br>
“Good Lord, Draco. You don’t think…Oliver knows?”<br>
“Zeanna wouldn’t tell anyone,” I interjected quickly. Mum and Dad looked at each other, then at me.<br>
“Beauxbatons is a fine school,” Dad said hesitantly.<br>
“For FRENCH people!”<br>
“They speak english there too dear,” Mum said from behind her book. <br>
“You’ll make new friends-&quot;<br>
“I was happy with my old ones!”<br>
“But they might not be happy with you.”<br>
His words hurt. Because they were true. <br>
“Alright,” I relented. “If you say it’s okay.”<br>
It wasn’t okay with me, but there wasn’t a lot I could do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I knew about Allegra being enrolled at Beauxbatons.<br>
What I didn’t know…well. <br>
That night I’d gone to bed (as you do) and sleep came easily for a change. Except Draco kept butting in on my thoughts.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I think there’s something wrong with Hermione.<br>
I’m trying to sleep.<br>
She’s always sick.<br>
Sleeping now.<br>
Mostly in the mornings though.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“And I’m awake,” I muttered to myself. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Put one and one together, Draco. What does it sound like?<br>
That she’s sick.<br>
In the mornings. What do we call that?<br>
Morning…sickness? No. She can’t be-<br>
Maybe. Now go away.<br>
Do you know? Has she told you anything?<br>
Oh, yes. Us being so close. Go to sleep!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I didn’t hear anything for the rest of the night.<br>
The morning of Christmas Eve dawned clear and bright, and the day was passed mostly lazing around the place, until night fell and we all went into the lounge. The lights on the tree sparkled and the fairy laughed, a sound something akin to water tinkling. We’d all sat down on the seats around the room, and no one was even speaking, mesmerised by the tree.<br>
“Well, I’ve got something to tell you.”<br>
Hermione’s voice broke the silence tentatively. My stomach clenched. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Morning sickness…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“I’ve needed to tell you for a while, but I was putting it off. It concerns you all…”<br>
“Come on Hermione, what is it?” Harry asked.<br>
She twisted her hands together, a habit I’d noticed she’d only recently picked up.<br>
“I’m…pregnant.”<br>
Our reactions were not so great.<br>
“That’s <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>disgusting</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!” <br>
That was Allie.<br>
“Um, is that good?”<br>
Harry.<br>
Me, I just settled for trying to form words. I managed to look very much like a fish. Draco leapt up and hugged her, looking delighted.<br>
“I’m glad you’re happy,” she whispered in his ear. <br>
“Why wouldn’t I be?”<br>
Finally I got out a sentence out.<br>
“Since when?”<br>
Hesitantly, she said “October.”<br>
“That’s…” I counted on my fingers. “Almost three months!”<br>
“I wanted to be sure.”<br>
“It’s a long time to be sure and not say anything.”<br>
She didn’t reply. Instead she got up and asked me to come with her to the kitchen. <br>
“I wanted to be sure, because it seemed so unbelievable.”<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
“What happened in October, Kat?”<br>
“Well, unspeakably bad horror movies, for one-&quot;<br>
“Before that.”<br>
“We…we went back in time mysteriously…and you…and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ron</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->…oh my God!”<br>
She nodded gravely.<br>
“You-you did <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?”<br>
“No one was around-&quot;<br>
“So you had a quickie in the bushes? I think I’m gonna be sick!”<br>
“It wasn’t like that-&quot;<br>
“Newflash! Babies are not made by doing nothing! What makes you so sure it’s his anyway?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“How do you feel? You’re going to be a big sister!”<br>
I blinked. Dad seemed so happy, and I didn’t get why. <br>
“Why is that a good thing?”<br>
“Someone to play with. New games. You know, I always wanted a little brother or sister.”<br>
“You had Uncle Harry.”<br>
“We didn’t…get along.”<br>
“But you still had him,” I pried. “So what do you mean?”<br>
“I mean lots of brothers and sisters. More than one, so there was always someone to talk to.”<br>
“But I don’t want one!”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Just…a feeling.”<br>
“That’s not a lot to go on.”<br>
“Look, I just know, okay? I can feel it!”<br>
I leaned against the bench. “What are you gonna do?”<br>
“Well, getting rid of it isn’t an option.”<br>
“Hermione, if this baby comes out looking like Ron, what’s Draco going to think? You can’t say you had a quickie with your dead boyfriend.”<br>
“I’m not worried about it.”<br>
“Look, we might not be as close as we were, but I still know you. This is tearing you up.”<br>
She didn’t look at me.<br>
“This is weird…blast from the past or something, y’know?”<br>
“Yes,” she replied quietly. “But I’m <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>happy.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“But it’s <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wrong.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
Her eyes flashed angrily. “No, it’s not! Because I – I love him!”<br>
“He’s dead!”<br>
“But I have his baby.” Her face took on a dreamy expression.<br>
“It’s not going to bring him back.”<br>
“It doesn’t have to.”<br>
I couldn’t fathom how it was even possible to have a baby to a long dead man. <br>
“Hermione, how is this going to work? You’re kidding yourself, you know that? The kid’s not meant to exist. It could turn out wrong.”<br>
We both jumped when the door closed behind us.<br>
“It’s Ron’s baby?”<br>
“How long have you been listening?” Hermione demanded. <br>
“Since the start,” Harry said flatly.<br>
“It’s not what it sounds like-&quot; she tried to say.<br>
“What it sounds like? You’re having a dead man’s child.”<br>
“It’s exactly what it sounds like,” I interrupted.<br>
“But…how?”<br>
Hermione left the room. I could’ve killed her, leaving me to tell Harry.<br>
“It’s not possible.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Allie, I know it will take a lot of getting used to, but you’ll learn.”<br>
“But it’s going to cry and smell and take all your time! And you’ll never get any sleep and-and-&quot;<br>
“You read too much,” he sighed.<br>
I couldn’t tell him what was really bugging me. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Bam, time displacement. Bam, time placement,” I told him simply. <br>
“And Ron was there? Alive?”<br>
“It was Allie’s tenth birthday. She was with Cho and Cedric. Draco and I, we were together, and Hermione and Ron.”<br>
“Desia?”<br>
I looked away, and he grabbed my shoulders.<br>
“Kat? Was Desia there?”<br>
Unable to look him in the eye, I nodded. Something dripped onto my arm and I realised he was crying.<br>
“You loved her?”<br>
“It doesn’t matter. How did it happen?”<br>
“We’re not sure. But we jumped down a portal, Hermione, she didn’t want to go but I made her-&quot;<br>
“Wait. You made her? Are you saying…you could have stayed? Could have changed it?”<br>
“Cho and Cedric were killed anyway, Harry. How long before Aphrodesia and Ron were next?”<br>
“And Aurora?”<br>
“Dead. She killed herself.”<br>
“So Desia’s death could have been stopped!-&quot;<br>
“No. I don’t think it works that way.”<br>
“But you don’t <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>know,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” he countered. “If we found a way to get back…”<br>
“I wouldn’t go back there, even if I had a choice. I think it was primed to start again, Harry. Can’t cheat death. Fate.”<br>
“Kat, you don’t understand.”<br>
He tilted my chin up, forcing me to look him in the eye.<br>
“Aphrodesia, she was my world. I don’t think even you can understand this.”<br>
“I do, I understand-&quot;<br>
“You think? Tell you what. Fall in love. Fall in deep, true, across the ages love, the love we thought didn’t exist when we were kids. Then watch it leave before you. Watch as it dies, as every breath becomes a struggle. Watch it lose. Watch that love get killed even as you fight and shout to keep it.<br>
“Then, Kat, and only then, will you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ever</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> understand.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“There’s something else, isn’t there?”<br>
I writhed uncomfortably in my chair.<br>
“Allie. I’m your dad.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No, you’re not,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> an insistent little voice said. I ignored it.<br>
“You don’t want to know.”<br>
“Of course I do, sweetheart. Tell me.”<br>
The truth of it was, I was scared. Of having someone else to love. Someone who I might hurt, or even kill, accidently, just through getting mad. I didn’t want to have someone else I’d have to worry about hurting.<br>
If Mum had this baby, I’d have to be even more careful, because if it died, I wouldn’t just be hurting it. I’d be hurting everyone around me.<br>
I hate being the Reaver. I hate knowing that I can’t allow anyone to get too close. I hate that no matter what happens, I’m going to die.<br>
But I didn’t say any of that to my dad, sitting there, looking so proud and so sad. Maybe in his head he’s grateful for this kid, because I won’t be here and he’s going to need a replacement, another little one to love. Not another me. He probably wants a normal little witch or wizard, who doesn’t kill people.<br>
No. I didn’t say that to my dad.<br>
“I don’t want it to make you stop loving me.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Now it’s <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that doesn’t understand.”<br>
He could only stare at me.<br>
“I did, Harry. I fell too hard, too fast. Too deep. And I’ve smashed into the ground so bad. I found that kind of love, and I screwed up. And I don’t think I’ll ever get it back, so yes. I’m watching it die. Watching it struggle. And I’m losing it more and more with each passing day, every time he looks at her, then back at me. I’m losing this fight, and I can’t do anything about it.”<br>
For the longest moment he didn’t say anything. <br>
“Sometimes,” he eventually started, “I wonder where these dreams go, because the world got in our way.”<br>
I knew the lines all too well.<br>
“What’s the point in ever trying? Nothing’s changing anyway.”<br>
He had a melancholic smile on his face as he pulled a bottle of whiskey from the cupboard.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Get up! Get up! Presents!”<br>
“Allie, it’s seven in the bloody morning! Go back to sleep!”<br>
I tore down the stairs, paying Dad’s words the attention they deserved – none. Who sleeps in on Christmas? I made sure to stomp as loudly as I could. <br>
“Miss! What is wrong?”<br>
“Nothing, Emelas. Do you want to wake everyone up for me?”<br>
“Oh, no, Miss! Emelas has much to do today, Miss! There is so little time-&quot;<br>
“Alright, alright…”<br>
The elf walked away, head down, muttering to herself. I continued into the room where the tree was, presents stacked high underneath. Mum was up already, dark circles surrounding her eyes.<br>
“Morning, love,” she yawned.<br>
“Are you alright, Mum?”<br>
“I’m fine. I’d let you open these presents, but I think we should wait for the others, don’t you?”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Uh, no!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I stretched lazily, not wanting to wake up just yet but knowing I had to.<br>
My slow wake up was curtailed when my arm hit something solid beside me.<br>
Heart pounding, I yanked the covers off.<br>
“Harry!”<br>
He looked up at me, bleary-eyed.<br>
“What? I’m aw-Kat?”<br>
“Yah uh!”<br>
I leapt out of the bed.<br>
“What the hell are you doing…”<br>
My eyes fell to his pants draped over the end of the bed, to his shirt thrown halfway across the room. I put a hand on my suddenly aching head. He sat up, looking around himself, finally snatching up his pants and pulling them on.<br>
“I…I…um…” <br>
Ew. I mean…ew. What had I done? <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> done? I tried to think back to last night…conversations…alcohol…<br>
Whoops.<br>
In a flood it all came back. <br>
“Oh, Harry…do you remember?”<br>
Sleepily, he nodded. “Kind of. I remember whiskey.”<br>
“Argh…no wonder I’ve got such a headache…God, what did we do?”<br>
“I don’t remember anything after whiskey.”<br>
I groaned. “Out!”<br>
“What?”<br>
“Out! Before someone sees!”<br>
“Embarassed?” he asked, flashing a grin with a cheekiness that reminded me he was related to Draco.<br>
“Out!”<br>
“I’m going, I’m going…”<br>
I opened the door for him.<br>
He walked straight into Draco.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I sat impatiently waiting for everyone to get up. Finally, Mum got up and went over to the tree. She threw me a soft package.<br>
“Open that while you wait.”<br>
I tore into it. A neatly folded robe the colour of an apple sat there. I looked at Mum.<br>
“It’s for Beauxbatons,” she explained. “They haven’t got house colours there.”<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Beauxbatons.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
“Mum, I don’t know if I can go.”<br>
“Of course you can.”<br>
“No, really. What if…what if something happens? What if I do something?”<br>
“Allie. You’ll be fine.”<br>
“You don’t know that.”<br>
It had occurred to me how little they did know. Who was to say I wouldn’t do the exact same thing at Beauxbatons as I had at Hogwarts? If anything it might be worse, because I wouldn’t know anyone. And what if somehow they found out?  <br>
“They’re all what if’s and maybe’s, Allegra. Nothing for sure,” Mum said gently. “You’ll be fine. I know it.”<br>
“I hope you’re right,” I replied.<br>
“Well, try it on then.”<br>
I pulled the robe from the wrapping and put it on over my pajamas. It was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>warm</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
“It’s really thick.”<br>
“French winters can be cold.”<br>
I twirled around in it, watching it swirl at the bottom. “You thought me going to Hogwarts was far away enough, Mum. So what will you do when I’m in France?”<br>
“I’ll be fine. Like you.”<br>
“You’ll have a baby.”<br>
“Oh, not for a while yet, dear. Six months to go.”<br>
“Can I come home if it’s really bad?”<br>
“We’d never make you stay.”<br>
“But…then where would I go?”<br>
“There’s always Durmstrang.”<br>
“You’re joking. Please tell me you’re joking.”<br>
“It’s a very good school.”<br>
“If you want me to kill half the-&quot; I stopped short. “I wouldn’t want to go there.”<br>
“I wouldn’t send you there if it was the last wizarding school in this universe.”<br>
“There are others?”<br>
“Oh, yes. Many. Not as esteemed as Beauxbatons or Hogwarts, but there are many.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I did the first instinct. I shoved Harry out the door and slammed it shut. I leaned against the door. There was some muffled conversation, then footsteps trailing away. <br>
The door shook a little as someone leaned on it from the other side.<br>
“You still my girl?” came Draco’s voice.<br>
A few thousand replies ran through my mind as I stood in silence. His girl. Like we were fifteen again. Like he wasn’t with another.<br>
But I could say the only reply that sounded right as he walked away. He didn’t  hear me.<br>
“Always.”<br>
I grabbed a bag from the wardrobe and started throwing my things into it. I realised how little I actually had. I’d been a free ride here, and suddenly I felt like a freeloader. I didn’t exactly pay board or anything. I kept the room I was in as tidy as I could. <br>
That got me thinking about Harry. Where he stayed when he wasn’t here, when he’d have to go back to France. Why he’d said all those things about Aphrodesia, then ended up with me. <br>
Oh, yes. As soon as heavy thoughts come, it’s time to leave.<br>
As much as fate tells you no, you have to realise when to go.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“So, if it really got worse, I could go to one of them?”<br>
“I don’t see why not.”<br>
“But I thought you were alright with Beauxbatons?” Dad asked from the doorway, perplexed.<br>
“We’re talking what if’s, Dad.”<br>
“Ah. Don’t. It never leads to a good path.”<br>
“Robe looks good,” Harry said. I smiled.<br>
“Right. Let’s crack into these presents.”<br>
“What about Kat?”<br>
“She’ll be down in a bit.”<br>
“Here, Allie. Merry Christmas,” Harry interrupted. Grinning, I ripped the wrapping off, revealing the Starbolt 4000 inside.<br>
“I knew it!”<br>
“Oh, well this goes down well then.”<br>
Dad handed me a box labelled “Broomstick Servicing Kit”. Mum went pale.<br>
“Hermione? Are you alright?”<br>
“I’m-I’m fine. I just need some air.”<br>
But she didn’t go outside. She headed upstairs to Kat’s room.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Kat, it’s Hermione. Let me in.”<br>
In a panic, I shoved my half packed bag under the bed, but it was too late. Hermione had come in anyway, and saw my things strewn around.<br>
“Going somewhere?”<br>
“I, um…”<br>
“Things getting rough?”<br>
“What?” Surprised, I looked up at her, wondering what that had to do with anything.<br>
“I asked you if things were getting rough.”<br>
“Why?”<br>
“You always want to run when it gets hard.”<br>
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” I asked angrily. She laughed.<br>
“Ten years ago. You ran. My husband tries to – tries to force himself on you and you almost ran.”<br>
“You <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>knew</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> about that?”<br>
“Eyes and ears are everywhere in this house, Kat. You’ll learn that.”<br>
“You knew and you’ve done nothing? You’ve stayed by his side even after that?”<br>
I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.<br>
“I love him.”<br>
“You do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!” I exclaimed. “You just told me you’re still in love with your <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>dead</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ex!”<br>
“I love him, despite it all.”<br>
“How?”<br>
“That’s not important.”<br>
“What did you come here for, Hermione?”<br>
“What did Draco and Harry give Allie that day before Halloween?”<br>
I remembered she hadn’t been at the house when Draco had given Allie her gift. But I didn’t understand why she needed to know.<br>
“Draco gave her a broomstick servicing kit…Harry gave her a broom.”<br>
“Was it…was it a Starbolt 4000?”<br>
I furrowed my brow, thinking. “I think. Starbolt something anyway. Why?”<br>
“She just got given those now.”<br>
“And?”<br>
“You don’t think it’s strange?”<br>
“You don’t believe in coincedence?”<br>
“Not now. Not anymore.”<br>
“What? You think it’s going to happen here or something?”<br>
“Anything’s possible.”<br>
“My God, I have to get out of here before I kill someone. I need normality!”<br>
“Oh, face it,” she said disdainfully. “You’ll never be normal.”<br>
“I didn’t ask to get stuck with the witch gig!”<br>
“Allegra didn’t ask to be the Reaver and she’s not running anywhere.”<br>
“Give her half a chance…” I muttered under my breath.<br>
“What?”<br>
“Nothing.”<br>
“Why are you leaving?”<br>
“It’s none of your business.”<br>
“Will you stay today?”<br>
“No. I don’t need to.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Kat and Mum came into the room, and the tension between them was almost visible. Kat held two bags in her hands.<br>
“Where are you going?” I asked. She smiled sadly.<br>
“I’m going to stay somewhere else.”<br>
“How come?”<br>
“It’s…I need my own space. Whoa. Someone hauled,” she said, changing the subject. I grinned at the pile of stuff before me.<br>
“Oh, this is cute!” She picked up a shirt and examined it. “Wish I could wear it…”<br>
Everyone stared at her. “Oh, come on. Like you weren’t all thinking it.”<br>
“I’m fairly certain I wasn’t,” Dad drawled to Mum, who stifled a laugh. <br>
“Can’t you stay a little longer?” I pressed.<br>
“Sorry, kiddo. No can do. I’ll visit. Write too, maybe.”<br>
“Are you going to be that far away?”<br>
“Don’t know,” she replied vaguely. <br>
I couldn’t find anything to say. No one could. Dad started looking fiercely angry, then he calmed down again. Kat began to cry. Mum stood there, stony-faced, impassive. Harry said nor did nothing. Eventually, after so much silence, she walked away. The front door opened.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You always run.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
The words were etched on my mind as I followed Hermione downstairs, unsure of what to say. After a little banter with Allegra, I was going to go.<br>
As usual Draco stood in my way.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You running again?<br>
What’s it look like?<br>
Like you’re nothing but a runaway.<br>
Thanks. <br>
Would you stay?<br>
No.<br>
Why not? </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
His eyes grew angry.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>For once, do what I want. For once?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he asked.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What for?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
With that, as I felt tears prick my eyes, I went to the door and opened it, letting the sun warm my face before I stood outside. Footsteps thundered toward me. <br>
Or maybe that was just my heart. I don’t know. <br>
I felt Draco snatch my arm.<br>
“Why do you always run?”<br>
“I don’t <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>belong</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> here. You know as well I do.”<br>
“You belong here as much as Potter.”<br>
“To you that’s not a lot.”<br>
“He’s…still my brother.”<br>
It seemed to take a lot of effort to get that out.<br>
“Even after what must have happened last night.”<br>
I shuddered inwardly. I didn’t want to think about it. He reached out, and we hugged.<br>
We let go as fast as we’d touched.<br>
“Still your girl?” I asked, parroting his words back at him. He looked at the open door behind me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“He always chooses her,” Mum said bitterly. Uncle Harry took her by the arm and led her into the next room. My ears pricked up automatically.<br>
“He does love you.”<br>
“How can you be so sure?”<br>
There was a couple of seconds’ awkward silence.<br>
“I just am, that’s all.”<br>
“Harry, how did we get here?”<br>
“Hm?”<br>
“Here. Where we are. How did it all get so wrong?”<br>
“This is wrong?”<br>
“Desia and Ron are dead. I know another existence where they weren’t, another place where they lived and breathed…and Kat pulled me out of it, Harry. And I’m so lost. Everything here, it’s hard and bright and violent, not like it was back there. Everything I feel, everything I touch…it’s hell. Just getting through one moment to the next, knowing what I’ve lost…I can’t handle it. And I’ve got a baby that shouldn’t exist as much I want it to. As much as I know it’s wrong and bad, I can’t let it go, Harry. I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>can’t.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“You won’t have to.”<br>
“But if Draco ever found out…”<br>
“He’d understand.”<br>
“It’s Draco, Harry. When has he ever understood me?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Always.”<br>
I nodded. So many things had changed, yet that one fact remained the same. <br>
Just as another did – I didn’t belong here. It was all what could have been, not what was.<br>
“So. Bye.”<br>
“Wait. You’re still going?!”<br>
“Don’t <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>do</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> this. Enough already!”<br>
“Can’t you see I just want you to stay?”<br>
Exasperated I threw my hands in the air, almost dropping my bags.<br>
“Give me a reason!”<br>
He stepped toward me and leaned in.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>All the lights are misty in the river, and all the trees are full of starlight, and all they can gather is the two that matter forever and forever.<br>
A touch.<br>
He dies.<br>
A kiss.<br>
She dies. <br>
A way out. <br>
Fate takes the blow,<br>
and the sorrow is all they know.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
We broke apart, but not very far. Our foreheads were touching.<br>
“Do you see?” I asked. He nodded and moved away.<br>
“I don’t want to. But I do.”<br>
“I’m going to go. And I don’t want you to say anything until I’m out that door, okay? I don’t want you to run after me. I don’t want you to yell at me. I’m not going away forever. I’ll visit, and I’ll write. It is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>nothing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like last time.”<br>
He started to speak, so I picked up my stuff and walked out. He got his words out though.<br>
“Aren’t I reason enough?”<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Allegra</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
But that meant the baby…not meant to exist? It couldn’t be another Reaver. It couldn’t. I almost tore into the other room to ask what she meant.<br>
But then the front door closed. <br>
Only one set of heavy footsteps came back.<br>
“Will she come back, Dad?”<br>
“Yes, of course.”<br>
I’m so sure.<br>
Mum and Harry came back.<br>
“Is she gone already?” Harry asked. I didn’t miss the look of relief in Mum’s eyes. For a moment no one moved. No one even seemed to breathe. Maybe that’s why it was so weird when all three of them said the exact same thing.<br>
“She always runs.”<br>
A glance out the window and I saw Kat there, not running, but walking slowly. At the end of the drive, she stopped, as if contemplating her next move. I looked away before I saw what she did.<br>
