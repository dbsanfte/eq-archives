==^== Introduction ==^==<br>
<br>
Darkness, the area where there is no light, a place where love and friendship are absent. Such is the world of one who takes a life, even in self-defense. The quilt that consumes that person is itself a horrible monster, unstoppable by any force. There are few things that can penetrate this darkness and bring light into its world, a love so strong that it can withstand all odds and obstacles laid before it. The love of best friends that have become more than just friends, more than either know, more than can ever be told.<br>

<br>
He looked down at his hands, covered in the blood of the man he’d just killed. Looking around the dark alley, he heard the sounds of people shouting, and feet running. His survival instinct taking over, the boy got up and ran in the other direction, leaving the Nietzschean lying in the gutter.<br>
<br>
Moving as silently as he could, the boy crept along the shadows. The Nietzschean patrol had found the body, the boy knew they would search until they found him, or a person they thought to be him. On Earth, nobody killed a Nietzschean and expected to live. The punishment was a public execution of the killer and his immediate family, husband, wife, and children. The Dragans liked to make a point.<br>
<br>
Continuing to move through the shadows, the boy had to hide several times to avoid the patrols. Moving like a shadow himself, he finally made his way to a safe house, if there truly was such a thing any more.<br>
<br>
The safe house was an old burned-out, bombed, half-destroyed building with a reinforced basement. He’d once heard the basement called a ‘fall-out shelter,’ whatever that was, but this was his destination. Entering the building, he passed several hidden checkpoints without a second thought, he knew them and they knew him. He came to the stairway leading to the basement, it was as usual, pitch-black.<br>
<br>
Opening the stairway door and going down the black path, he was aware of the hidden cameras and auto-guns tracking his movement. Finally reaching the bottom, he approached another door, this one reinforced with a rare alloy. The alloy was so strong that a gauss gun couldn’t blast through it. The door opened at his approach, the doorman on the other side kept a gun pointed at him as he entered.<br>
<br>
“You’re late,” a voice said to his left, the Leader didn’t seem upset, but looks can be deceiving.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I know,” the boy said as he nervously rubbed the back of his neck. “I ran into a Nietzschean and had to deal with him.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, I know, the scouts are reporting increased Dragan patrols all over the city, you really shock them up good, Banshee,” the Leader praised.<br>
<br>
None of the group went by their real name, in fact the only names they knew were the folkloric monikers given them when they joined.<br>
<br>
“Thank you, Sir. I got the information you wanted; I was on my way back when a drunk Nietzschean stopped me. I defended myself with those new techniques you developed, and then I finished him off with my stiletto.” Banshee said as he turned the data chip over to the nearest technician.<br>
<br>
“Good, very good, it’s nice to see the new techniques are paying off. Now, if an agent can kill an uber every time they may begin to fear us as they should.” Leader said with a smile.<br>
<br>
After the cheering subsided, he went on.<br>
<br>
“Now Banshee, I have a final mission for you, if you accept it that is. I say final because if you take it you’ll have to leave Earth, forever. However, there is an upside, you will become a living legend among humans. Before you decide, sleep on it and tell me in the morning, but wash the blood from your hands first.” Leader said as he dismissed Banshee to the sleeping quarters.<br>
<br>
==^==<br>
<br>
As he lay in his bed, blood washed from his hands, questions filling his mind, Banshee considered the mission.<br>
<br>
“Become a legend and have to leave Earth forever, stay and be just an agent the rest of my life. The choice seems clear, I think.”<br>
<br>
After several hours of mental debates, he finally fell asleep, knowing what he’d tell the Leader in the morning.<br>
<br>
==^==<br>
<br>
In the morning, Banshee returned to the main room for breakfast, having slept in the adjoining quarters.<br>
<br>
“Well, have you decided?” Leader asked as Banshee joined him at a table for breakfast, cup of coffee in hand.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I have, I’ll do it. But I want to be off planet before the ubers start looking for me.” Banshee said as he absently stirred his coffee.<br>
<br>
“Good,” Leader said as he clapped him on the shoulder, “I’ll explain the mission. We’ve been hired by a salvage ship to steal several crates of Dragan missiles; we’re to deliver the crates to a pre-arranged landing bay. Now, here is where you come in, we need you to infiltrate the Dragan supply depot and steal the crates. On your way out blow the reactor, the hitch is that your image will be picked up by their security system, that's why you have to leave Earth. Once they have your image, they won’t stop looking until they find you, dead or alive. Once you blow the reactor and deliver the crates, get on that ship, it’s your ticket off world. Another agent will meet you outside the depot and take you to the pad. Now that you’ve been briefed, go get your data port checked. I know it was only installed a few weeks ago, but you’ll need it to complete your mission. Have the doctors check on your tattoo, I don’t want anyone but us to see it, now get to the doctor.”<br>
<br>
Grinning, Banshee got up from the table and headed for the infirmary.<br>
<br>
==^==<br>
<br>
“Well, aside from a little tenderness around the port, the implant looks fine. The swelling will go down in a week, now let me see you arm.” The doctor ordered as he ran a scanner over Banshee’s arm. “Hmmm, yes, only the ying-yang is visible to the naked eye. However, under a special combination of infrared and ultraviolet the wraith is clearly visible. You’ve checked out fine, considering your, unique immune system. Report to acquisitions for your gear.”<br>
<br>
With that the doctor released Banshee to gather his gear.<br>
<br>
==^==<br>
<br>
Entering acquisitions, Banshee went over to the first tech he saw.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me, but I need to get some gear.”<br>
<br>
Turning to face him, the man checked his flexi.<br>
<br>
“Name and mission type?” He said.<br>
<br>
“Banshee, infiltration and demolitions.”<br>
<br>
“Ah yes, here you are, one standard blaster, one color shift infiltration suit, and one encrypted bracer.” The man handed Banshee the articles as he named them. “There you go, good luck on your mission.”<br>
<br>
“Thanks.” Banshee said as he left with his gear, he returned to the room he’d spent the night in to change.<br>
<br>
==^==<br>
<br>
Having changed into the infiltration suit, he made his way through the basement that housed the headquarters for the Order of the White Shadows. The Order is a powerful and far reaching  resistance movement with chapters around the world. They have the best human doctors, scientists, and the newest and best technology available.<br>
<br>
Banshee was one of a hundred field agents located in and around Boston.<br>
<br>
He left the basement and stealthily made his way to the Dragan depot, dressed in the color shift suit, he blended with the buildings and the shadows.<br>
<br>
Moving against the concrete buildings, Banshee arrived at the depot 20 minutes later. It was mid-afternoon, this excursion was mainly a recon run, scouting out the Dragan weaknesses. He’d stay hidden until nightfall, then he’d make his move.<br>
<br>
==^==<br>
<br>
Hours later, when the sun was setting, Banshee had devised a way into the depot. The ubers were so full of themselves that they had allowed a five minute gap between patrols. All he had to do was sneak in, steal the crates and blow the reactor, simple.<br>
<br>
Simple plans tend to be the ones that always have trouble. Getting past the patrols was simple, wait for the gap and then run, scale the wall, hide in the shadows, next part of plan. Luckily for Banshee, that part of the plan went exactly as planned.<br>
<br>
Hidden in the shadows as he was, he had time to visually scout the complex. It was a standard supply depot, one garrison of troops, offices, warehouses, torture facilities, the usual. It was towards the warehouses that he now moved.<br>
<br>
 There were a total of 15 warehouses, all powered by the underground reactor, as were all the other buildings. Banshee knew exactly which one he was headed for, number 13.<br>
<br>
Warehouse 13 was nestled at the back of the compound, making it easy for Banshee to stay hidden. Approaching the doors, he say that they used old and out dated security locks, easily pick able for a ‘master criminal’ like Banshee. He called himself a criminal because that’s how the Dragans had the order portrayed by the few remaining news agencies.<br>
<br>
Having easily picked the lock, he entered the darkened warehouse. Looking at his bracer, he followed the map to the crates, 100 Surface-To-Air Missiles ripe for the plucking.<br>
<br>
He had the missiles, now all he had to do was get them to the landing port and blow the reactor.<br>
<br>
Moving to a computer, he accessed the Dragan security grid. If he wasn’t going to be able to ever return to Dragan controlled Earth, then he’d make sure there was a very good reason to avoid the Dragans. Accessing the core through the security grid, he implanted a devastating virus he’d created into the main reactor control. When the virus activated it’d blow the core and their entire power grid for days. Turning towards a security camera, he waved, making sure they got a good image of him. He’d release that with the virus, no sense getting caught before the reactor blew, once activated the virus was unstoppable.<br>
<br>
Having set the cameras to play a looped image from before he entered, he turned towards the crates. Standing in front of them, he activated his comm link.<br>
<br>
“Banshee to Wraith, come in,” he said to thin air.<br>
<br>
“Wraith here, go ahead Banshee,” came the reply.<br>
<br>
“I’ll need transport for 100 SAMs at Depot 28, warehouse 13, delivery to customer 8536A, a Mr. ‘Ipsen,’ docking bay 36.”<br>
<br>
“Got it, be there in 2,” with that the agent known as Wraith signed off.<br>
<br>
Returning to the security console, Banshee set to work looping the compound cameras, allowing Wraith to arrive with the trucks.<br>
<br>
The trucks were rigged with noise reducing engines, making it easy to slip by the drugged guards, tranquilizer darts stuck in their necks.<br>
<br>
As the convoy of two trucks pulled into the warehouse, Banshee came up to them, closing the doors behind the trucks.<br>
<br>
“Nice to see you Sea…Banshee,” Wraith said as the other man approached and signaled the way to the SAMs.<br>
<br>
“Ten crates, five on each truck, you guys will take different routes to the rendezvous point, understood?” Banshee asked as the 2 men with Wraith nodded.<br>
<br>
“So, how long do we have?” Wraith asked as he helped Banshee load the crates.<br>
<br>
“About 5 minutes till the patrols get suspicious, we have to be gone before then.”<br>
<br>
“I’ve heard that we’ll never see you again, that you have to leave Earth. Is that true?”<br>
<br>
Banshee took a minute before answering, making sure the last crates were on the trucks.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, it is,” he said with a sigh. The two other with Wraith got in their truck and drove out of the warehouse without another word.<br>
<br>
“Before we leave I’m gonna activate a virus in their systems that’ll blow the reactor, so get the truck ready to go, I’ll be riding with you,” he said as he moved to the computer console.<br>
<br>
“Banshee, I…” he began.<br>
<br>
“Wraith don’t, you knew this day would come when we joined. We’d either die for the cause or be banished for it. I’m lucky to be banished, who knows what’s waiting for me out there. I may meet the girl of my dreams,” he said with a derisive laugh, he’d never been popular with the women. Banshee sighed as he considered one day finding a girl to settle down with, a dream he had few hopes of fulfilling.<br>
<br>
“She’s out there, I know it, and you’ll meet her some day. Come on, we need to go now.” Wraith said as Banshee activated a countdown.<br>
<br>
“We’ve got 2 minutes to get out of here before the reactor blows,” Banshee said as he and Wraith got in the truck.<br>
<br>
“No problem, we’ll be gone before they know what’s happened.”<br>
<br>
With that Wraith started the truck and drove out of the warehouse, taking a different route than the other truck.<br>
<br>
==<br>
<br>
“I’ll never know how you managed to blind their sensors, but I’m glad you did. We almost didn’t make it out of there, those Dragans would have found us if their scanners were working,” Wraith said under his breath.<br>
<br>
They were currently hiding in the forest, the truck carefully screened. Banshee and Wraith were hardly breathing as a Dragan Patrol  marched past, on their way to warehouse 13. There was no way they'd be able to explain the truck to the Dragans so they hid it and themselves in the brush off the side of the road. Fortunately for them, the patrol was more interested in the warehouse in front of them, then the forest surrounding it.<br>
<br>
After what seemed an eternity, Wraith released the breath he'd been holding, he turned his head to say something to Banshee, but stopped when he held up his hand.<br>
<br>
“4 … 3 … 2 … 1 … BOOM!” He whispered as the virus activated and caused the reactor to overload.<br>
<br>
The explosion was spectacular, too bad they didn’t stay around to see it. as soon as the reactor blew Banshee and Wraith were in the truck driving as fast as they could away from the Depot.<br>
<br>
The only way to describe the ensuing events would be to call it complete and utter chaos. The Dragans were running around, trying to put out the fires, desperate to restore any power that they could. As it stood, the compound was defenseless and the Dragans were basically sitting ducks, not to mention that most, if not all of the buildings were destroyed in the explosion.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, everyone was too busy to notice a lone truck driving away from the compound, headed in the direction of the Spaceport.<br>
<br>
==<br>
<br>
Arriving  at the Spaceport five minutes later, they met the other truck and waited to make the delivery, they didn’t have to wait long. A few minutes later, an old freighter in need of repair landed at docking bay 36, exactly at the scheduled time.<br>
<br>
Banshee waited for the ‘Customer’ to exit before leaving the shadows. When he saw the man walking down the gangplank, he moved towards him to finalize the transaction.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me, but are you Mr. Ipsen?”<br>
<br>
“Who want’s to know?” The man asked, folding his arms over his chest. Banshee could tell the man was trying to decide if he could take him, judging by his small size, the man decided he could and relaxed, a little.<br>
<br>
“Just a messenger, I have a message from your friend Sam, he says that he’s ready to be picked up.”<br>
<br>
“Is that so? How much did Sam pay you to tell me that?”<br>
<br>
“100 Thrones, in two pouches of ten.”<br>
<br>
“I see, he paid you well,” Ipsen said.<br>
<br>
“Yes he did, he mentioned one condition to his travel,” Banshee told him.<br>
<br>
“And that would be?”<br>
<br>
“That I go with you, I’m no longer welcomed here and need to get off world. So, would you like to pick Sam up?” Banshee asked.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I would, even with his condition. So, where is Sam?” Ipsen asked, looking around the deserted port.<br>
<br>
“Right here,” Banshee said as he gave a piercing whistle. Lights came on directly behind him in the shadows and two trucks pulled towards the freighter.<br>
<br>
“You get Sam loaded then find me on the ship, we’ll leave when you do,” Ipsen said before turning and walking away.<br>
<br>
==<br>
<br>
Three minutes later, all the SAMs were loaded in the freighter’s cargo hold, returning to Wraith, Banshee made his goodbye.<br>
<br>
“Well Wraith, I’ll see you in the Space Lanes, someday,” Banshee said as he hugged the other man.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I’ll see you,” Wraith replied without conviction as he returned the hug.<br>
<br>
Pulling apart, the two men took a step away from each other, Banshee then turned and went up the gangplank into the freighter.<br>
<br>
“See you Cousin,” Wraith said as the gangplank retracted into the ship<br>
<br>
As the ship lifted off, Wraith just watched it leave with his best friend on it, never to see him again. After the ship had left the atmosphere, Wraith got back into his truck and returned to the Order's headquarters for the mission debriefing.<br>
<br>
==^==<br>
<br>
Aboard the freighter, Banshee made his way to the cockpit, there he met a beautiful Redhead, Ipsen standing behind her.<br>
<br>
Clearing his throat to get their attention, he stepped forward to introduce himself.<br>
<br>
“My name is Seamus Harper, I’m an engineer.”<br>
<br>
“Bobby Jensen, and this is Rebecca Valentine,” Ipsen replied.<br>
<br>
“Owner and Captain of the Eureka Maru, welcome aboard Seamus,” she said with a small grin.<br>
<br>
“I’d appreciate it you could call me Harper, no one’s called me Seamus since my parents died.”<br>
<br>
“Ok, Harper it is, so you say you’re an engineer. Get to work on the engines, they’ve been acting sluggishly and I may need them at full capacity,” Beka told him.<br>
<br>
“You got it boss,” Harper replied.<br>
<br>
“Oh, and Harper, we’ll drop you off at the next Drift out of Dragan space,” she called over her shoulder.<br>
<br>
“K, thanks,” he said as he got to work on the engines.<br>

<br>
Did I drive you away? <br>
I know what you'll say, <br>
You'll say 'Oh, sing one you know,' <br>
But I promise you this, <br>
I'll always look out for you, <br>
That's what I'll do <br>
<br>
Say I... <br>
I say I... <br>
<br>
My heart is yours, <br>
It's you that I hold on to, <br>
That's what I'll do <br>
I know I was wrong, <br>
But I won't let you down, <br>
Oh yeah I will, yeah I will <br>
Yes I will <br>
<br>
I said I, <br>
I cry I, <br>
<br>
I saw sparks <br>
I saw sparks, <br>
I saw sparks, <br>
I saw sparks <br>
Singing out<br>
<br>
Harper was singing off key as he worked on yet another project, vital or not, it commanded his complete attention.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I saw sparks,” he sang, he then yelped as the project in front of him shocked him.<br>
<br>
“Sparks, that’s no joke,” he said as he sucked his finger while continuing to work.<br>
<br>
Trance smiled to herself as she silently approached the engineer.<br>
<br>
“Whatcha doing, Harper?” she asked, causing him to literally jump two feet into the air, forcing Trance to start giggling.<br>
<br>
“That was not funny, Trance. You could have given me a heart attack.”<br>
<br>
“Then I would have been here to save you, I do know CPR,” she replied, still giggling.<br>
<br>
Harper couldn’t control the flush that rose to his face at the though of Trance giving him CPR.<br>
<br>
“Well, that wouldn’t be all bad,” he said in a vain attempt to recover his composure.<br>
<br>
“So, what were you working on?” she asked again.<br>
<br>
“It’s a new toy for Rommie, it’ll allow her to use her internal scanners to their full extent,” he said proudly.<br>
<br>
“Meaning what?”<br>
<br>
“Meaning that she will be able to tell what type of intruder it is, rather than just that it’s an intruder. It has a link to her special and cultural databases.”<br>
<br>
“Sounds impressive,” Trance said with a smile, causing Harper’s heart to skip a beat.<br>
<br>
“Thanks, so why are you here? And don’t tell me it’s just to see what I was doing.”<br>
<br>
“Um, I came down here to see when you were going to eat lunch, I want to show you a new plant I got,” she told him excitedly.<br>
<br>
“Normally, I don’t eat lunch, unless you or Beka force me to, but I’ll make this one exception, for you.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you so much, Harper, I just know you’ll love this new plant,” Trance exclaimed as she rushed over and enveloped Harper in a hug, causing him to lose his breath.<br>
<br>
“Your welcome Trance, but if you don’t let go, you will need to use that CPR, I can’t breath.”<br>
<br>
Trance quickly let go before he began seeing spots.<br>
<br>
“Well, are you ready to go?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, just let me make a small adjustment to this, there, now we can go,” he said as he placed the sensor pack on the workbench and removed his tool belt.<br>
<br>
“After you Trance,” Harper said with an extravagant gesture towards the doors, Trance led the way out, her tail swinging gracefully behind her.<br>
<br>
==^==<br>
<br>
As they made their way to Hydroponics, they engaged in their usual small talk. How the other was doing, how their various jobs were, how they didn’t have much time to do anything anymore, when they thought the ‘taskmaster’ would give them leave, stuff like that.<br>
<br>
Entering Hydroponics, they continued their conversation as they moved as one towards Trance’s workbench. Sitting on the tabletop was the most beautiful plant that Harper had ever seen; it had a purple stalk with delicate violet leaves, yellow and pink flowers, and stood about three feet tall. It reminded him of Trance.<br>
<br>
“Wow, Trance, it’s beautiful, I’ve never seen anything quite like it. You know,” he began growing thoughtful, “it kinda looks like you, Trance.”<br>
<br>
“Really, I didn’t notice, I just thought she was pretty,” she lied, knowing full well that the plant looked like her. She knew that he’d take the bait, say what she wanted him to say, consciously or not, and she not only wanted to hear it, but she also wanted to gauge his reaction.<br>
<br>
“Yeah she is pretty,” he said absently as he examined the plant, this of course drew a grin from Trance. “Notice how the stalk is the same color as your tail, and the leaves are like your skin. The flowers are definitely the same color as your hair.”<br>
<br>
“Where did you find this?”<br>
<br>
Harper turned towards her as he voiced his question.<br>
<br>
“I got it from my home planet, it was left for me at our last stop. I got it for you to put in your quarters.”<br>
<br>
“You got this for me, why?” He asked as he gently fondled the velvety leaves, releasing a pleasant smell that reminded him or Trance, earthy and smelling of nature.<br>
<br>
“I wanted you to have a beautiful plant for your quarters, I’ve been in them remember. They need a lot of help, you could kill yourself tripping over all that junk, and then where would that leave me? Without my best friend, that’s where. I just thought your room could use a woman’s touch, that’s all.”<br>
<br>
Harper just smiled as she went on about why she got the plant and the chaos of his quarters. His smile turned to mild shock when he heard the phrase ‘woman’s touch’.<br>
<br>
“Uh, Trance?” he asked as silence fell between them.<br>
<br>
“Yes?”<br>
<br>
“What do you mean by ‘woman’s touch’?”<br>
<br>
“Oh, I just mean that your quarters need more plants and color, that’s all. Why?” she asked innocently.<br>
<br>
“No reason, I was just curious about your wording. On Earth, when a woman says that to a man it means that they are going out and are probably living together,” he tried to explain the term to Trance.<br>
<br>
“Don’t we live together here on Andromeda?” she asked, once again showing how innocent and naive she was.<br>
<br>
Harper just sighed and put his head in his hands, how could he explain the intricacies of human relationships to a purple pixie?<br>
<br>
“Follow me Trance, I’ll try to explain it all to you,” he said as he moved into the Hydroponics garden and towards a large tree set away from the door.<br>
<br>
As Trance followed she wondered why they were going to sit under the tree and why did it seem like he was stalling.<br>
<br>
The tree was a huge oak that had been planted many years ago by the original gardeners, it provided a nice, quiet place to sit and talk, away from the entrance to Hydroponics.<br>
<br>
“Sit down Trance,” he said gesturing to the grass beneath the tree.<br>
<br>
“Are you going to explain it to me?” Trance asked excitedly, happy to be able to spend any time with he busy engineer.<br>
<br>
“Yes Trance, I am. Now where to begin,” he said out loud.<br>
<br>
“Well, begin at the beginning and when you get to the end, stop,” Trance smiled as she quoted a passage from her favorite book, Alice In Wonderland, a book that Harper had introduced her to.<br>
<br>
Harper smiled at her mention of their private joke, he had once said that she was like Alice, innocent of the world she found herself in. Trance had then said that he would be the White Rabbit, due to the fact that she’d follow him anywhere.<br>
<br>
“When I say living together, I mean two people that aren’t married that are living in the same quarters and having …” here he faltered, how could he explain sex to Trance, let alone even say the word in her presence?<br>
<br>
“Having what?” she prompted, leaning across the small space that separated them to place her hand on his knee. He needless to say jumped, a little.<br>
<br>
“Uh … um … having … sex,” he noticed the understanding wash over her and was glad that he wouldn’t have to explain that to her.<br>
<br>
“Oh, I guess that we aren’t living together then.”<br>
<br>
Harper just laughed and pulled her next to him, placing a gentle kiss on her head as he enveloped her in a friendly hug.<br>
<br>
“Trance, what would I ever do without you?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know, but I really don’t want to know,” she said as she relished the warmth of his strong arms around her.<br>
<br>
A moment later, they both realized how this might appear to the others, breaking apart they got up and left Hydroponics for the Mess Hall and the promise of food.<br>
<br>
What neither noticed was that their shoulders or hands would occasionally brush the other’s, so close were they walking.<br>
<br>
==^==<br>
<br>
After they had eaten Harper and Trance returned to the Machine shop and his abandoned sensors.<br>
<br>
“Thanks for the plant, Trance, normally I would leave it in Hydroponics, but since you got it from your home planet, I’ll put it in my quarters.”<br>
<br>
Her eyes brightened as he said this, unable to control her joy she threw her arms around him in another hug.<br>
<br>
“I’m thinking I’d better get use to all these hugs. If you’re not careful, my purple princess, you may spoil me,” he said as she pulled away.<br>
<br>
“Maybe,” she replied cryptically, “I’ll have Rommie deliver it to your quarters. Will I see you for dinner?” she asked with her hands behind her back and a shy smile on her face.<br>
<br>
“That all depends if you’re willing to eat here in the Machine Shop, I gotta finish this sensor pack today.”<br>
<br>
“Sure, that sounds like fun. I’ll bring dinner,” she said as she skipped out the doors.<br>
<br>
Just before they closed she ran back and placed a kiss on Harper’s cheek, shocking the engineer, once again.<br>
<br>
“Bye Harper,” she whispered softly in his ear before once again skipping out.<br>
<br>
“Later,” was all his addled mind would allow him to say. Turning towards his workbench he tried to focus on the sensors, but found his mind filled with thoughts of Trance.<br>
<br>
“Damn, now I’m never gonna finish this pack.”<br>
<br>

<br>
==^== Chapter 2 ==^==<br>
<br>
Three months later, Harper was dropped off at the first drift the Maru came to, Alacar Drift, the first respectable drift out of Dragan Territory.<br>
<br>
Since his arrival on the Maru there have been a few noticeable changes, one of which was the absence of Bobby Jensen, the other was the increased efficiency of the engines.<br>
<br>
“Well, Harper, this is where we say goodbye, it’s been fun having you onboard,” Beka said as she escorted him to the airlock, his only bag slung across his shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, it sure has, thanks for letting me stay as long as you did, and I’m sorry about Bobby. I thought you knew those were missiles.”<br>
<br>
“He told me they were computer parts, but that’s ok, I was getting tired of the way he treated me anyway, so you save me an excuse,” she tried to lighten the somewhat somber mood, but failed.<br>
<br>
“Well, Beka,” Harper extended his hand to her which she took, “it’s been real fun. If you ever need another engineer just look me up.”<br>
<br>
”I’ll do that, well I wish you the best of luck out there.”<br>
<br>
“Thanks, I have a feeling I’ll be needing it,” with that cryptic remark Harper left the Maru forever, or so Beka thought. Closing the hatch she tried to think about where she could find another engineer, sighing, she returned to the pilot’s chair and requested permission to leave. Considering how bad this sector and it’s drifts were, she decided to go to El Dorado Drift, she could find an engineer there.<br>
<br>
==<br>
<br>
As Harper roamed the streets of Alacar Drift, the few hundred thrones he’d left Earth with and the few he’d gotten from Beka for his work on the engines, tucked safely against his ribs.<br>
<br>
As he roamed the streets and alleys he got the impression that this was the type of place where a person could disappear and not be found, if he had the mind to.<br>
<br>
Finding a reasonably priced hotel he paid the 30 thrones and went to his room. Compared to what he’d had on earth, this was a palace. It was even better than he rooms provided by the Order. Looking around the spartan furnishings, he felt that he may just be able to make something of himself here.<br>
<br>
Sitting on the bed he considered going out for a drink, the Maru didn’t have a single drop of alcohol on her, and he needed a drink badly.<br>
<br>
Leaving his room he made his way to the entertainment sector, and the bars that dwelled within.<br>
<br>
Finding one that had no Nietzscheans in it he went up to the bar and stood, considering what he wanted to poison his system with, in the background an old Earth tune was playing.<br>
<br>
“What’ll it be?” A gruff voice asked from behind the bar. Looking up, Harper found a short, fat, bald human, with piercing black eyes and a scar running across his forehead, his nose was misaligned from one bar fight too many.<br>
<br>
“I’ll have a Weisbreu,” Harper told the man.<br>
<br>
“Sorry, fresh out, but I’ll tell you a secret, Sparky cola will give you the same buzz but without the hangover. You wanna try one?” He asked already reaching for the mentioned beverage.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, why not,” Harper agreed as the man pulled the drink from behind the bar and placed it in front of Harper. “Thanks.”<br>
<br>
Popping the tab on the can, Harper leaned against the bar considering what his next move would be, listening to the song that was playing at the moment, by a group called Queen if he remembered correctly.<br>
<br>
I take a step outside<br>
And I breathe the air<br>
And I slam the door<br>
And I'm on my way<br>
I won't lay no blame<br>
I won't call you names<br>
'Cause I've made my break<br>
And I won't look back<br>
I've turned my back<br>
On those endless games<br>
<br>
I'm all through with ties<br>
I'm all tired of tears<br>
I'm a happy man<br>
Don't it look that way?<br>
Shaking dust from my shoes<br>
There's a road ahead<br>
And there's no way back home<br>
Ohh but I have<br>
Leaving home ain't easy<br>
Oh I never thought it would be easy<br>
Leaving on your own<br>
Oh is the main thing calling me back?<br>
Leaving home ain't easy<br>
On the one your leaving home<br>
<br>
Stay my love my love please stay<br>
Stray my love what's wrong my love?<br>
What's right my love?<br>
Ohh leaving home ain't easy<br>
I thought how could I think of leaving<br>
Leaving on your own<br>
Still trying to persuade me that<br>
Leaving home ain't necessary<br>
Leave the only way<br>
Leaving home ain't easy<br>
But may be the only way<br>
<br>
He was enjoying his Sparky and the music when what appeared to be a couple of spacers walked in, discussing their various woes.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, the boss wants to find an engineer, the last one was a drunk and got tossed out an airlock,” one of them was saying as they sat next to Harper at the bar.<br>
<br>
“So he really tossed him out an airlock?”<br>
<br>
“Of course, not only was he a drunk but he was flash fried, no use to anyone.”<br>
<br>
“So now you’re down an engineer, tough luck. Where you gonna find an engineer on this drift, I mean no respectable engineer would be this close to Dragan space.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know, but the boss’ll find one, otherwise we can’t leave.”<br>
<br>
Harper took this time to interrupt them.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me, but you’re looking for an engineer?” He asked the man.<br>
<br>
“Who’s asking?” he replied cautiously.<br>
<br>
“An engineer looking for work,” Harper replied, hoping that was enough to satisfy the man.<br>
<br>
“An engineer you say, you any good?”<br>
<br>
“Any good, I’m a freakin’ genius.”<br>
<br>
“Well, I’ll let the boss decide, finish your drink and I’ll take you to meet him.”<br>
<br>
“Fine by me,” Harper said as he slammed down an entire can of Sparky in one gulp.<br>
<br>
“By the Divine,” the bartender said, “I’ve never seen anyone do that, most people can’t even stand the taste.”<br>
<br>
Harper just grinned, remembering the things he used to eat and drink to survive.<br>
<br>
“How much?” He asked the bartender, reaching for his ‘wallet’.<br>
<br>
“2 thrones, I can’t move the stuff, so I’ll give you a deal on it.”<br>
<br>
Harper paid the man his two thrones and  followed the Spacer back to his ship.<br>
<br>
==<br>
<br>
Reaching the docking bay, the Spacer led Harper towards a freighter marked Ariel.<br>
<br>
Entering the ship, Harper was led to the Captain, a man named Sampson.<br>
<br>
Sampson was a Spacer, born and bred. He had the tan that was due only to the unshielded radiation found in space. He was a muscular man of about 35, crew cut brown hair and green eyes. He stood an impressive six feet, which naturally made him an imposing presence.<br>
<br>
“Sir,” the Spacer Harper had followed said, “I may have found us an engineer.”<br>
<br>
“Really,” Sampson said as he took in Harper’s somewhat disheveled appearance.<br>
<br>
“Yes sir,” Harper said stepping forward.<br>
<br>
“Can you fix slipstream?”<br>
<br>
“Slipstream? I can fix that in my sleep,” Harper said with his usual forthrightness.<br>
<br>
“AP tanks?”<br>
<br>
“Are you kidding? That’s cake.”<br>
<br>
“Impulse engines?”<br>
<br>
“Of course.”<br>
<br>
“Environmental systems?”<br>
<br>
“Absolutely.”<br>
<br>
“Navigational systems?”<br>
<br>
“Don’t insult my intelligence, I am a freaking genius, if it’s on a ship, I can fix it,” Harper said in finality.<br>
<br>
“Good, you’ve got any references?” The Captain asked as he crossed his arms over his chest.<br>
<br>
“Just one, Beka Valentine of the Eureka Maru. Worked with her for 3 months, before I decided to move on.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll have Charlie here contact you in the morning, after I check your reference. But if Valentine confirms what you’re telling me then you’ve got the job. Now get out of here and get some sleep. I’ll have Charlie contact you at your hotel, just tell him where.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you sir, and you won’t be disappointed,” Harper said with a smile as he followed Charlie, the Spacer he’d followed before, off the ship.<br>
<br>
Giving him the hotel and room number, Harper returned to the hotel to sleep, as the Captain had suggested.<br>
<br>
Already knowing that Beka would vouch for him, he fell asleep anticipating Charlie’s call in the morning, and reporting for duty on Captain Sampson’s ship.<br>

<br>
Just one quick question about the AFA's, can WIP be nominated for anything other than the Kick In The Butt or do the storys have to be complete? If they do can I suggest something like and Up And Coming Category for fics that are turning out to be really incredible rather than just ones we'd really like to see finished. <p>BRING BACK THE TAIL<br>

No, WIPs are only allowed in the 'Kick In The Butt' awards section, however you may suggest new categories to either Val or Skutter. please do so through the AFA BBS, or by sending an email to webmaster@affirmingflameawards.com with the subject of &quot;Category Suggestion&quot;<br>
<br>
I hope that answers your question, now in my next post, Chapter 3! <p>==^==<br>

<br>
After Harper and Trance had their dinner in the Machine Shop, Harper happily reported the sensor pack ready. This however was due entirely to his determination to get it done. Thoughts of Trance were swimming through his head the entire time he worked; it also didn’t help that she was there, having dinner with him.<br>
<br>
“Well Rom-doll, I’m happy to report your new sensor pack is ready to be tested, and I threw in a few surprises for you as well,” he said with a grin as he set the pack on the floor of Command.<br>
<br>
“Mr. Harper, I’m glad to see that you were able to finish that this week,” Dylan remarked as he entered behind the young man.<br>
<br>
“Yup, and I’ll start the next project as soon as I know this one is working.”<br>
<br>
“If your preliminary results are anything to go by, then this will increase the effectiveness of the sensors by 12%, in addition to making the internal sensors harder to jam.”<br>
<br>
“That’s the point, Andromeda,” Harper said as he addressed the hologram.<br>
<br>
“Let’s get this pack installed. I have at least 10 other projects that need to be finished this week,” Harper said as he led Rommie off the Command Deck towards the sensor controls, leaving an amused Dylan behind them.<br>
<br>
==<br>
<br>
On the way to the controls, Harper and Rommie discussed the possible benefits of the new sensors.<br>
<br>
“Like I told you before, Rommie. This pack will help to prevent all but the most sophisticated jamming technologies. I know you want to block all jamming signals, but there are some that modulate on a random frequency, making them damn near impossible to block.”<br>
<br>
“I know that Harper. I’m just concerned with how they may affect the navigational sensors.”<br>
<br>
“They shouldn’t affect them at all, they operate on two entirely different systems. There is no way they can cross-talk. The only problem is the time it’s gonna take to install this. I have to crawl into some of the smallest crawlways on the ship to get this thing in, so I hope it works.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, me too,” Rommie said softly as they arrived at the access hatch to the inner crawlways of the Andromeda Ascendant, crawlways that only Harper and service droids can fit into.<br>
<br>
“Well Rommie, I’m off to the dark reaches of your tunnels. How about a good luck kiss?”<br>
<br>
“Harper, you’re pathetic,” she said as she rolled her eyes and tried not to smile.<br>
<br>
“I know, but that’s why you love me,” he replied as he crawled into the tunnels.<br>
<br>
When he was far enough in, Rommie handed the sensor pack to him. To make it easier to move, the pack had been placed on a rolling dolly, perfectly sized to fit through the crawlways.<br>
<br>
“Thanks Rom-Doll, I’ll have this installed in a jiffy,” he said as he pulled the pack after him into the crawlway. Rommie could only walk away, leaving him to his work. As much as she hated to admit it, she cared more for the engineer that any other crewman she had ever had, except for Dylan. Her feelings for Dylan were different than the ones she had for Harper -- Dylan she loved and wanted to be loved by, Harper she loved as a though she were his mother and wanted to protect him with her life.<br>
<br>
Harper continued to crawl back towards Command as Rommie walked away. His progress was slow; the spaces were tight and he had a forty pound pack trailing behind him.<br>
<br>
==<br>
<br>
Harper had estimated that the installation would take about 2 hours; he was off by 3 hours. So instead of finishing in 2 hours, he would now be finished in 5. The reason being that the entire sensor grid had to be shut down manually, and that alone took 30 minutes, starting it back up took another 45.<br>
<br>
The type of shutdown he was using was a maintenance mode shutdown, which meant that the entire grid was down with no connections to the rest of the ship&lt;,&gt; or to the outside world.<br>
<br>
As Harper was nearing the 2 and a half hour mark, Trance paid him a visit in the cramped tube he currently found himself in.<br>
<br>
“Harper?” she called softly as she crawled through the conduits.<br>
<br>
“Trance?” he called in reply, surprise evident in his voice. Trance just smiled and crawled towards the sound of his voice.<br>
<br>
“Hi Harper,” she said sweetly when she saw his prone form on the deck.<br>
<br>
“Hey ya Trance, what brings my sparkly purple princess down here?”<br>
<br>
“You do,” she replied. “I brought you something to eat.”<br>
<br>
“You did? Trance, I love you,” he told her as he reached for the food, stopping before he took it. “Um, let’s move to a place where we can actually sit up. Follow me.”<br>
<br>
He led the way as they crawled to the nearest intersection, a place where two tunnels met, and there was enough room to stretch out, within reason.<br>
<br>
“Great, I’ll eat here. So, what’d you bring me?” he eagerly asked.<br>
<br>
“A turkey sandwich on white bread with a Sparky cola, and I brought desert too, but you’ll get that later.”<br>
<br>
“Trance, you’re the best. You know I love you right? I mean I really do love you, you’re the best, my best friend, the best ever!” he said through mouthfuls of sandwich.<br>
<br>
“Harper, slow down and chew your food, I don’t want you to choke,” she said with a smile as he slowed his pace.<br>
<br>
“So Trance, what have you been doing today?” he asked as he swallowed the last of the sandwich and reached for the Sparky.<br>
<br>
“You know, the same old stuff, cleaned Medical, watered the plants in Hydroponics, and made you lunch.”<br>
<br>
“Sounds like a pretty full day,” he replied as he downed the Sparky in one gulp. “So. What’s for dessert?”<br>
<br>
“I made this special for you,” she said as she took a grape custard filled tart with grapes topping it out of the little basket she brought with her. “However, there is one condition, you have to tell me how you got that scar on your chin.”<br>
<br>
“My scar? Why do you want to know where I got that?” he asked her as he settled back against the wall.<br>
<br>
“I’m just curious, you never talk about your past much, and I’m just curious how my best friend got that scar,” she explained, knowing that she herself never revealed anything to him.<br>
<br>
“You really want to know, don’t you?” he asked, it wasn’t really a question, more of a statement in which he resigned himself to tell her about his past.<br>
<br>
“Well, I was working for a man named Sampson, he was Captain of the freighter Ariel. He stood six feet high, he was like a mountain, but he had the heart of a lion. You would have liked him Trance.” Harper’s eyes lost focus as he began recounting his time aboard the Ariel.<br>
<br>
“Was? What happened to him?” Trance asked when Harper paused.<br>
<br>
“That’s how I got the scar, but I’m getting there. I had been working with him for about a year, doing all the stuff I did on the Maru, fixing the engines, AP tanks, that sorta stuff. Anyway, we had just left El Dorado drift for another freight run. Everything was normal, all systems were functioning, and we were making good headway. We were about to enter Slipstream when we were attacked by Nietzschean pirates.” Harper paused as the memories came flooding back to him, memories he didn’t want to remember.<br>
<br>
“They took out our Slipstream drive and crippled the main engine. They wanted our cargo of communication, navigation and slipstream parts, they can sell for a small fortune on the black market. The Captain decided that we would take as many of them with as we could, considering how we were all going to die. We set up an ambush at the airlock, we knew that we would only be able to take down the first couple of rows, so we had hand to hand weapons ready to use. We had scavenged the ship for anything we could use to take them out, knives, sharpened metal, anything. So we were waiting for them as they docked with the ship. We waited for the airlock to pressurize and the door to open before we opened fire. The first vanguard fell, allowing those behind them to take cover and return fire. We continued firing at each other, each side losing men, finally we decided to just go hand to hand. That’s when it really got ugly. Their leader decided to join the party and was he a piece of work. This guy was as tall as Sampson and twice as wide, and he carried a wicked looking blade; he knew about hand to hand combat. As the fight waged on, the deck plates were littered with blood and bodies, with more joining it every few minutes. As our forces were depleted, actually only the Captain and myself were left, the pirate leader was laughing as we defended ourselves. With a signal his men stopped fighting and let him advance. I was determined to win this fight. I charged the leader with my knife extended. We locked blades a few times before he stabbed me in the shoulder, a wound that would cause me to slowly bleed to death. He then kicked me in the stomach. As I was leaning over, he went to cut off my head, I moved back in time to avoid losing my head, but his sword cut my chin. Leaving me where I had fallen he went to fight the Captain. They fought for what seemed like hours, but was only minutes, and Sampson was stabbed in the stomach. He staggered over to me and picked me up, we both looked at the pirate, and he just grinned back. Sampson then led me towards the command deck and the escape pods located there. The pirates had decided that they would finish us later -- we weren’t a threat -- and began to take the cargo. The Captain put me in one of the two pods and moved to the main computer. He then activated the self-destruct for 30 seconds after the escape pod was launched. Moving to me, he said ‘Harper, it has been a pleasure working with you, you truly are a genius.’ Due to the pain I was in, I didn’t understand the implications his words carried. He then placed a flexi and a credit chip in the pod and closed the door. Through the pain I saw him destroy the controls of the other pod, just as the pirates decided they would kill us. He jettisoned my pod. The last time I saw Captain Sampson alive, he was overrun by pirates. Thirty seconds after my pod was launched, Ariel exploded into dust, taking the pirates and my Captain, my friend, with her. I finally succumbed to the darkness that was calling me. The pod was set to find the nearest drift. I woke up on a hospital drift a week later; I was the only survivor. That, Trance, is how I got this scar.”<br>
<br>
“Harper, I’m so sorry, I remember hearing about the crew of the Ariel, and her lone survivor. They never released his name, something about the company not allowing it. I never realized that it was you,” she said with a questioning tone.<br>
<br>
Harper smiled, a little. “The parts were for Sid Prophet’s company; they didn’t want my name revealed due to the fact that the parts were probably stolen and they didn’t want anyone questioning the crew about where they came from. Trance, can I have my dessert now?”<br>
<br>
“Oh, of course, sorry Harper,” she said with a shy grin as she handed him the dessert.<br>
<br>
“Thanks, mmmm, this sure looks good,” he said as he bit into the grape tart, a smile on his face.<br>
<br>
Trance couldn’t help but smile at the joy that was etched on his face as he ate the dessert.<br>
<br>
“I’m glad you like it, Harper, I’ve gotta go back to work now,” she said sadly, not wanting to leave her friend.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I should get back to work, I’ve got another 2 hours on this thing. Hey, after I’m done, you wanna have dinner with me?” he asked quickly.<br>
<br>
“Sure Harper, I’d love that,” she replied with a radiant smile, warming the young man’s heart.<br>
<br>
“Great, I’ll see you then,” he said as Trance began crawling back into the conduit, but not before giving Harper a kiss on the cheek.<br>
<br>
As Harper followed her back to where he was working, he watched her tail swing back and forth behind her. He was so entranced by the movement that he hit his knee on the partially installed sensor pack. Biting back a curse he rubbed his knee as Trance turned to look at him.<br>
<br>
“I just hit my knee, that’s all,” he said quickly as he felt his face grow hot. He was certain that she knew he was watching her crawl.<br>
<br>
Trance just smiled and continued on until she rounded the corner out of view -- Harper was certain that her tail waved at him before it disappeared. Dismissing that to the pain in his knee, he went back to work on the sensors.<br>
<br>
==^==<br>
<br>
True to his word, Harper finished installing the pack 2 hours after his quick meal with Trance. All he needed to do now was restart the system.<br>
<br>
Entering Command he went straight to his station, giving Rommie instructions the entire time.<br>
<br>
“Ok, Rom-doll, I’m gonna restart the system now, I want you to monitor the grid for any spikes.”<br>
<br>
“You got it Harper,” the avatar replied as her eyes closed and she scanned the sensor grid.<br>
<br>
Harper began the restart, system by system. He began with the priority systems first, long range and navigational sensors.<br>
<br>
“Long range and navigational sensors are online and working well above High Guard requirements, in fact, this is the best they’ve ever worked,” the avatar praised as she looked at Harper with joy.<br>
<br>
“I added a few new features and upgrades as well,” he said as he continued to restart the sensors. “I’ve even upgraded the sensor output display, I enhanced the 3D mapping abilities of the projection. It can now show a holographic 3D view of ships just within sensor range, before visual contact is made. It’ll also work for other objects within sensor range.”<br>
<br>
“Mr. Harper, I am truly impressed,” Dylan said as he leaned against his console, admiring the skill with which Harper worked.<br>
<br>
“Thanks boss. Rommie could you check the integration of the navigational sensors with the long-range sensors. I want to make sure there are no loose connections.”<br>
<br>
“I’m not detecting any, but we will know better once the other systems are back online.”<br>
<br>
Harper just grinned as he ran the final sequence to fully bring the navigational sensors online and connected to the long-range sensors. This was the easy part, the rest of the sensors would take another half hour to restart and check the intersystem connections. Not only were the various sensors able to talk to one another, the new hardware also provided a more secure connection protecting the various systems from sabotage.<br>
<br>
“How long will it take to bring the rest of the systems online? Beka isn’t happy about playing guard with the Maru; she wants to return as soon as possible.”<br>
<br>
“Umm, I’d say about 30 minutes, don’t worry boss, she’ll be home before she can plan any nasty acts of revenge,” Harper said with a smile to relieve any fears of retaliation Dylan may have. Beka didn’t like putting the Maru in any form of danger, and acting as a sensor drone for the Andromeda was a form of danger.<br>
<br>
“Good, Rommie, please inform Beka she can return the Maru to Hanger Deck as soon as Harper has finished, I am going to Medical to get something for a headache,” Dylan said with a groan as he moved toward the Command Deck doors.<br>
<br>
“Aye,” was Rommie’s only reply as she continued to monitor the sensor grid.<br>
<br>
As the doors were closing behind him, Dylan thought he heard Rommie mention something about Harper and Trance in a conduit together and something about a kiss, but he ignored it, it had to be the headache.<br>
<br>
==<br>
<br>
Hearing the doors close behind Dylan, Rommie took the opportunity to broach a subject with Harper.<br>
<br>
“So Harper, what were you and Trance doing in that conduit for half and hour? And what about the kiss?”<br>
<br>
“You were spying on us?” Harper looked up from the console, hurt showing clearly in his eyes.<br>
<br>
“No,” Rommie said empathically, not wanting to hurt her creator and friend. “It is my job to monitor all life forms aboard ship for any health problems.”<br>
<br>
“But your internal sensors were offline,” Harper said, catching the lie, a smile tugging at his lips as he returned to working.<br>
<br>
“Ok, I was spying on you,” she admitted finally, “but only because I care about you.”<br>
<br>
“Really?” Harper’s head perked up at that comment.<br>
<br>
“Not in that way! I just want to see you happy, and you seemed happy when you were talking with Trance.”<br>
<br>
“Why are you so concerned with my happiness?” he asked as his humor sunk back into the abyss, dark resignation replacing it.<br>
<br>
“Because you’re my friend and creator, yet I can’t help but consider myself as you mother, I am always looking after you. I just want to see you happy. Can’t a mother want her child to be happy?” she asked as she placed a gentle hand on his arm. He sighed and dropped his shoulders<br>
<br>
“Your child? I never thought of it that way. Well, I guess I finally know who wears the pants around here, don’t I?” he asked quietly, his hands continuing to work as sadness washed across his face, realization dawning as to why she refused his advances – she viewed him as her child.<br>
<br>
Rommie seeing the sadness in his eyes embraced him in a hug. Harper realized that all her hugs felt like this, like a parent comforting their child.<br>
<br>
“Are you going to be alright?” She asked him as they broke apart.<br>
<br>
“Yeah I’ll be fine, I just need to get back to my work; love is a waste of time anyway,” he said with a sniffle.<br>
<br>
Rommie couldn’t help but express outright sadness at his statement, but she quickly hid it.<br>
<br>
“Harper, can I ask you a question?” She asked a few minutes later, breaking the silence of Command.<br>
<br>
“Sure, go ahead.”<br>
<br>
“What do you think of Trance?”<br>
<br>
Harper was momentarily taken aback by the question: what did he think about Trance, what a strange question.<br>
<br>
“Umm, what do you mean Rommie?” he asked, truly not understanding her question.<br>
<br>
“What do you think of her? What is your relationship with her?”<br>
<br>
“Oh, we’re best friends,” he answered with a small smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “She’s my best friend in the whole universe, my only real friend. It’s not that you, Dylan, Beka, and Tyr aren’t my friends; it’s just that with Trance it’s different. We can share our secrets with each other and not feel like the other is judging.”<br>
<br>
“Harper, I’m glad to hear that. When you’re done with the sensors you can go visit Trance. She may be able to cheer you up, she always has in the past.”<br>
<br>
“Sure Rom-doll, whatever you say,” he replied as he continued to work on the sensors. Neither talked for the rest of the installation except to discuss the job itself.<br>
<br>
Half an hour later, Harper left Command to join Trance in Hydroponics.<br>
