He was in my class for most of grade school, and I had a seven-year crush on him (off and on).  He really is a loveable, sweet, funny guy, but he can be really really stupid.<br>
<br>
He dropped out of college during his freshman year.  He couldn't hold a job for more than a few months.  He has a band, and I think that's been his biggest concern.  It's what he loves doing.  He was living with his mom, but she got tired of his inability to act considerately towards the other people living there.  Anytime he was confronted, he replied with a torrent of verbal abuse, much of it vulgar.  If anything went wrong it was someone else's fault.  His mom had enough, and asked him to move out.<br>
<br>
His father helped him move out of his mom's house and into a home of one of his friends' mom's.  Eventually, he got another job, and he and his friend and her boyfriend found a nice apartment.  It was affordable, and it looked like he was finally on his way.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, a few weeks ago he was fired and his friends evicted him because of the same reasons that his mom kicked him out.  He appealed to his mom and dad to move back in with one of them.  They felt that saying yes would just perpetuate his pattern of self-destruction and projection of blame.  He spent the week sleeping at friends' houses or in his car.<br>
<br>
Late Thursday afternoon, he took almost a whole bottle of sleeping pills while he was sitting in his car in front of the rectory at my home church (his dad's one of our rectors, and lives in the rectory).  Right after he took them, he called his mom and told her what he'd done and where he was.  She called his dad and the Hamilton police.  Fortunately, the pills hadn't been inside him long enough to start doing damage.  He was conscious in the hospital, and their message to him was &quot;You need help.&quot;  His reply was &quot;I need a place to live.&quot;  It looks like this may have only been an attempt to force one of his parents to let him move back in.  Whether it was a &quot;serious&quot; attempt on his life or not, it's clear he needs professional help.<br>
<br>
Right now he's in a psych ward undergoing evaluation.  His parents and he are meeting with a social worker today to try and secure placement in a good facility.  Because he's 21, though, he has the choice not to accept treatment.<br>
 <br>
Please pray my friend will choose to address these issues.  He's really smart and gifted, and I love him to bits.  He's just being a poor steward of what God has given him.  Pray that God would open his heart so he can see how loved he is, so that he can choose to take hold of the life lines that are being thrown to him.<br>
<br>
(I adapted this from the email his dad sent around)<br>
<br>
I'd really appreciate all the prayer support I can get.  I don't even know what else to say...it's just been a bad weekend for all of us... &gt;_&lt;' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=t0mmyt>T0mmyT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mead Master<br>of the Grand Hooley<br>Cheeky Boy</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#B87333>(9/8/03 10:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A longtime friend...</span><hr size=1> Wow - I'm praying! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heartjoys>heartjoys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Velvet-Steel Wannabe</span><br>  Posts: 1161<br> <font color=#B87333>(9/8/03 12:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://heartjoys.fcpages.com/CladdaghAward.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A longtime friend...</span><hr size=1> Yes, I'll be praying for your friend.<br>
