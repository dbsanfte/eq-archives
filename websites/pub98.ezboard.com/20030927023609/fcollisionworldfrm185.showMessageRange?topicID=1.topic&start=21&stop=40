I wasn't sure why, but my father seemed to grieve one day, and the next day he was home with another woman, who he told me he was intent on marrying.&quot; She frowned. &quot;I didn't like her at all, she was always snappy and solemn and seemed to hate me and my brother, she really like my father's money. I began to not trust her, turns out I was right.&quot; She paused. &quot;When I was Eleven (So a year ago) I came home to a house hold of police and detectives, they told me that my father had died, and my brother was blamed for the murder. I asked them where Charlemagne was, (my father's new wife) but they told me her and my brother had disappeared, they claimed that Jake kidnapped her.&quot; She paused again. &quot;I didn't believe them, Jake was always a kind person and he hated fighting and the like, he loved my father and wouldn't have killed him.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She looked at Mahrain. &quot;What I dug up on Charlemagne proved that. She had been accused of seven other murders under that name and ten more under another. But somehow she always slipped past the police and got out of doing time in jail.&quot; Looking to the window she sighed. &quot;I was searching for my brother when I learned something more. She, Charlemagne wasn't just a random killer; she had been selectively murdering people. Taking their money and passing off some of it to an organization.&quot; She paused once again. &quot;I tried to figure out who they were, but that's when she started coming after me. I'm close to figuring something out, and they don't want me to...I'm scared their going to kill me. I know they have Jake and I don't want them to kill him to draw me out. I'm lost and I don't know what to do.&quot; She broke down in tears and dropped the glass she was drinking from.<br>

&quot;Sounds like your step mother is about as bad as mine. Trust me, they wont hurt Jake. she's too smart for that. she'll probably use him to draw you out, but not by killing him. if she kills him, she has nothing to lever with.&quot;<br>
<br>
Amanda looked at her, shocked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wasn't altogether truthful with you. I'm not just an aura-seeker. I'm a spy. please don't think I'm anything bad because I didn't tell you, but I thought you were too young to understand. I realize now you're not, not at all... My mother died when I was young. she was murdered, by my stepmother. I didn't understand till much later when my father had decided I needed to get out of my depression. Being a spy gave me something to live for, to find my mother's killer and put an end to them. My father was very rich, and had travelled alot in his younger days. like any guy, he had many women, one just happened to get pregnant, my mother. he never knew I existed until she died, and then he took care of me. My step mother was jealous of how much we connected, and so she poisoned him, but not before I ran away with felix, my friend and my mentor.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=digitalv7>DigitalV7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/12/03 8:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm185.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ReRE:incharacter</span><hr size=1> Amanda froze. &quot;That's horrible, I'm so sorry for you...&quot; She frowned. &quot;I'd say that maybe your stepmother was the same woman that my father married, but I don't think so.&quot; She paused. &quot;Scarlet wouldn't get jealous of someone, she marries them, gets her name in their will, and kills them to collect what they left her.&quot; She paused again as someone's voice reached the two people sitting and talking.

it was so frustrating, not being up there, not fighting. she felt weak, and helpless, at the mercy of the house. <br>
<br>
she felt like she did after her mother was murdered.<br>
<br>
her throat felt like it was constricting, and she couldn't cry infront of amanda. she forced the tears down, but with a fierce growl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Swven!&quot; She growled. &quot;You don't understand...&quot; She told him. his hand pressed reassuringly upon hers, and she ceased her frustrated pacing.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're still holding my hand...&quot; She told him, with a slight note of disbelief running in her voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm being stupid. I'm sure your boy can take them better than I can anyway.&quot; She told him, smiling into the dark. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alphakago>Alpha Kago</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/13/03 7:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm185.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/comics/lucifer.com/alpha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: your still holding my hand...</span><hr size=1> swven made no expression as usual to the words being spoken to him as the walls stood quiet and cold, swven stepped on something and it crushed underneath his foot. <br>
human bones is what it was. <br>
<br>
light filtered into darkness, <br>
and they seemed to enter into a small oasis. garden area with blossoming trees and ground flowers, Swven let go of there hands as soon as the light became visible, his hands slipped away as if death came upon him, when the light hit him he seemed to shine with a glow that wasnt earthial. <br>
<br>
Some mystic magic of old ages as a tear slid down his cheek that they couldnt see and he whiped it away. &quot;Well have to stay here until the count comes to get us.&quot; he whispered in a rather choked voice and ignored mahrains words as his silver hair gliscened with white and gold and his eyes an ever brighter and at the same time deeper blue. <br>
<br>
he'd changed before he ran down the stairs into a pair of white pants and a black long sleeved shirt, he sat down on an old Roman bench made of stone and with the carvings of staring white angels on the side, he leaned against the wall and soaked up the sun, <br>
<br>
and said absolutely nothing... He didnt want to speak it seemed his every action he did was offensive, so he figured staying still like rock was good enough, curled up on the bench just incase the girls wanted to sit down.. he thought nothing, he saw only darkness. And felt only sorrow. <br>

Mahrain stared at the lush geen garden with a mix of wonder and doubtfullness. Amanda had already seemed to forget what had previously happened, and began to run around looking at all the colorful flowers.<br>
<br>
Mahrain could only look at one thing, Swven.<br>
<br>
He sat, as still as the stone beneath him, curled up and hurt and it was her fault. *I'm such an idiot. I've got to tell him what I really meant!* She forced herself.<br>
<br>
She hadn't meant it as in 'eww, your still holding my hand...' she meant it as in 'after all the totally insane stupid and psychopathic things you've seen about me, your still holding my hand, even after you knew the truth.'<br>
<br>
She felt this need to take away all his pain, everything that had ever hurt him. even if it was her.<br>
<br>
she kneeled down infrot of his frozen form, and delicately brushed a stray lock of hair from his eyes. they glistened with tears.<br>
<br>
she allowed her finger to gently follow a tear stain, trailing over cool skin, his cheeks, his lips, she lifted his chin, and stared intensely into his brooding eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thats not what I meant.&quot; She whispered, her voice low and sultry, yet contrite. &quot;I was suprised, that-well, after all the horrible things you know about me, you still held my hand. you still accepted me, for who, and what I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
her hand had found its way back into his thick silvery hair, and she was shocked at how fine and smooth it was. a tear dropped onto her chin.<br>
<br>
it was her own tear, she was crying. <br>
<br>
Mahrain looked into Swven's blue, blue eyes, not caring if he pushed her away.<br>
<br>
she gently pulled him down to meet her, brushing her lips across his in a slow, chaste kiss.<br>
<br>
her other hand stroked his jaw, while she still caressed his hair, pulling him closer into a more passionate kiss. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=digitalv7>DigitalV7</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.silentangel.net/images/Majic%20Jin%20picture%20iconv2%20trans.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/14/03 7:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm185.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not what I meant at all...</span><hr size=1> Amanda stopped looking at the flowers and turned to the kissing couple. 'I've done to much to hurt them here. They've got their own problems. I'm not helping at all.' Silently turning she began to run. She didn't know exactly where she was, but she figured if she could get far enough away they wouldn't find her. And then they could forget her. What was she thinking? They grew every day, Scarlet would be back, Mikki and Vikki would follow and then, someone worse would come, someone who could kill them all. She couldn't let the other two get killed at her account, they were not part of this war. 'but they may soon be.' she whispered to herself as she hid in a bush and began to cry. It was just too much. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alphakago>Alpha Kago</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/14/03 7:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm185.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/comics/lucifer.com/alpha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not what I meant at all...</span><hr size=1> swven was shocked by all that had happened in the moment passed. he felt the lips against his and he accepted them. <br>
He realized this suddenly, He had never been kissed by a women in this time before, he had never been kissed by a women in his own time. <br>
<br>
He took mahrains shoulders into his hands and parted carefully a look of peace crept onto his face slightly, &quot;How wrong of me to judge a person when I myself am no better?&quot; <br>
<br>
He whispered his face stead and eye level with hers, A painting hung on one of the walls behind Amanda when she was looking at the picture, it seemed old and disheveled. collecting dust for sitting out in the elements.<br>
<br>
It was of the exact scene going on between mahrain and Swven as they appeared now. Broken apart from a sweet kiss that would resume days later. After tragedy, war fair. <br>
And loss of soul. <br>
<br>
The painter sat in his room quiet and surreal, the brush held loosly in his fingers at <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>IT</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  painted what it wanted, the chinese count sat in silence as his dark chocolate eyes watched the brush move on the canvass, and painted masterpieces. <br>
<br>
The house itself was awhole once again and he let the 3 of them have there piece of the garden, he spoke a word of advice to swven using his mysterious telepathic powers.<br>
~ Swven ~ he said. ~ Don't forget, you have to go back ~ <br>
<br>
After hearing this swven smiled at mahrain, &quot;We should go back up.&quot; he said .... &quot;Amanda, &quot; he looked over at her standing, &quot;You can take some flowers if you want.&quot; he smiled..<br>
<br>
the people in the painting were wearing 15th century roman clothing as swven wore when he showed up. the setting was the same but the clothing was different it seemed to tell a rather interesting story, as the swvens eyes in the painting, opened and looked at the 3 of them... Swven thought he was the only one who noticed.<br>
<br>
so he kept it quiet to himself and waited to see what the girls wanted to do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=digitalv7>DigitalV7</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.silentangel.net/images/Majic%20Jin%20picture%20iconv2%20trans.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/14/03 7:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm185.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not what I meant at all...</span><hr size=1> Swven looked up and realized that Amanda was gone. <br>

&quot;I bet she's planning right now.&quot; Amanda whispered to herself. &quot;And she's gonna come back and kill them.&quot; She closed her eyes and tried to remember something Scarlet had told her once, something that scared her.<br>

Mahrain followed Swven to Amanda's crumpled form. another tear slid down her cheek. she bent down, her long auburn hair tumbling over her shoulders asshe reached out her hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had a friend. I only met her once, but she said something to me, something I'll never forget, and I hope you wont either. She said, humanity lies not in what we give up, but in what we hold onto. don't ever give up Amanda. Whoever this womans accomplices are, whatever she tries to do, we have friends also, and you are our friend, and so our friends are yours,&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood up, addressing both Amanda and Swven. &quot; I think that no matter how hard we try to run, we'll never be able to hide from scarlet, or her organization. I think people will have to fight. now, bear with me, but I have a bit of a tale to tell, and maybe when I'm through we'll all be in agreement.&quot;<br>
<br>
She paused, and gathered her breath. &quot;After my father was murdered, Felix hid me as a sister of his in his gajdi caravan. Gajdi is a sort of gypsy culture. I met his sister, Shalel, the girl who told me what I told you. she was a witch. in the Gajdi cuture, it is forbidden, though I know she is very powerful. <br>
<br>
after the caravan, Felix found me a job with a man I know only as 'The Boss' He's a recluse who lives under the city, a sorcerer of great power who strongly identifies with the side of right, and the righteous. for about two years now, he has been sending me on assignements, watching individuals whose purpose in his game has eluded me for sometime, but, I think there is a connection between Amanda's plight and my job. A few months back, I had been researching the mystery of the boss, and I noticed a pattern. a woman, named lillian. she seemed to have her fingers in everything that the boss did. I believe that the organization has an enemy, not just in me, but in the boss and all in his employ. if we created a coalition, a network, if you will, we could possibly put an end to this organization, and to scarlet.&quot;<br>
<br>
She pause, looking at their startled faces. &quot;I was thinking big...&quot; She mumbled. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left
