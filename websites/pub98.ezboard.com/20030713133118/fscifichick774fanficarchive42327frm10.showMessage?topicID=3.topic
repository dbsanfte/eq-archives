1 ~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Warrick sat at the table in the break room eyeing Sara and Grissom, who were standing by the door, bantering about a case that had just come into the day shift’s inbox. Things were uncharacteristically slow for the night shift lately. It seemed like all of the bodies were being found or reported during the day, which left only spillover work for the night shift, and even that had to be pulled from Ecklie’s begrudging hands. He shook his head slightly.<br>
<br>
“Man, you two are never going to get it,” he commented in an almost whispered tone. Grissom turned his head to Warrick.<br>
<br>
“What?” Grissom asked, only having heard a mumble. Sara smiled at Warrick, but then her gaze once again fixed on Grissom. Warrick didn’t fail to notice this.<br>
<br>
“Nothing,” Warrick said, grinning, “just talking to myself.” Grissom nodded. Then, Grissom’s beeper went off, and smiles came to all of their faces. “We actually get to do some work tonight?” Grissom checked his beeper and nodded again.<br>
<br>
“Looks like it.” He responded, and then looked at Sara. She appeared almost giddy to finally be working on a case again. “Gather up Nick and Catherine while I find out about this,” Grissom said as he gave a small grin to Sara and Warrick, and left the room.<br>
<br>
“I’ll go get Nick,” Sara said cheerfully. “I saw him talking to Greg a couple of minutes ago.” Warrick grinned and got up from his seat. He was glad to see her happy about the possibility of working again, but was still bugged that she and Grissom hadn’t gotten beyond the occasional flirting stage. He didn’t know why it bothered him, but he decided to do something about it.<br>
<br>
“Guess that leaves me with Catherine,” he said as he walked past her into the hall. Sara smiled, and nudged him.<br>
<br>
“Not that you mind,” she commented. He turned around to look at her, and she was already heading toward the lab, but she turned around to flash him another smile. He shook his head. Warrick didn’t think that he had been as obvious about his feelings for Catherine as Sara had been about her feelings for Grissom.<br>
<br>
He walked down the hall in search of Catherine, sighing to himself. ‘Leave it to Sara to tease me about Catherine, but not be brave enough to act on her feelings for Grissom.’ Then he smiled. ‘Now I really am going to have to do something.’<br>
<br>
Within five minutes they were all gathered around Grissom’s desk, hopeful for the new assignment. Murder was bad, but boredom was worse, at least for this group. Grissom looked up and started to hand out assignments.<br>
<br>
“Looks like the underbelly of society heard your pleas for an end to your boredom,” Grissom said dryly. Nick smiled. Grissom shot him a look, and then asked, “What?”<br>
<br>
“Just thanking God,” Nick said, still with a huge smile plastered on his face. Grissom shook his head. Nick was the only one he knew that could possibly come up with a justification for that comment, so he let it go, but not without a roll of his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Nick, you and Warrick get…” Warrick cut off Grissom.<br>
<br>
“Gris, you mind if I get teamed up with Sara tonight?” He asked. Every head in the room turned to look at him, and eyed him suspiciously, except Sara, who looked more surprised than anything. Warrick just shrugged. “I need to talk to her about something.” Grissom raised his eyebrow, but relented to pairing them up. After hearing that Warrick needed to talk to her, Sara figured that it had something to do with her comment about Catherine, for which she was mentally chiding herself because now she didn’t get to work with Grissom. Not that she would have necessarily gotten to work with him anyway, but she didn’t want to entertain that thought.<br>
<br>
The teams headed off toward their respective cases, Warrick and Sara toward one crime scene and Grissom, Catherine, and Nick toward another. On the car ride over, Grissom looked like he was deep in thought, and his brow kept furrowing at the thoughts that were going through his head. Nick smiled.<br>
<br>
“Already going through possibilities when we haven’t even collected evidence yet? Man, you must have been more bored than I was,” Nick said. Catherine grinned at Nick, but then looked back to Grissom’s confused face. She decided against her better judgment, to press the issue that she knew he was thinking about.<br>
<br>
“So I wonder what Warrick wanted to talk to Sara about?” She asked casually, a hint of a smile played on her lips. Grissom swung his head to look at her, but then went back to driving as if nothing had been said, the comment still ringing through his ears. Catherine had to hold back from laughing. “It must have been pretty important for him to ask to be partnered with her,” she continued. Nick, oblivious to the underlying situation, decided to add to the conversation.<br>
<br>
“Well, they’ve been getting along a lot better since that whole bus crash fiasco,” he said. Catherine almost erupted with laughter, and just barely managed to contain it. She wondered if Nick knew what was going on, or if he was just adding his own observations. Either way, it was obviously getting to Grissom, as his hands had clenched around the wheel unknowingly, but with a mix of confusion and anger in his eyes. The car pulled to a stop.<br>
<br>
“We’re here,” Grissom stated and went into automatic mode, trying to push the thoughts about Sara and Warrick to the back of his head, at least for now.<br>
<br>
Warrick hadn’t said a word since he and Sara had arrived at the crime scene almost an hour ago, well, nothing that wasn’t work related. It was driving Sara crazy with anticipation. She didn’t really want to hear a lecture about how she shouldn’t tease him, because God knows he and Nick teased her enough about everything in her life, but she still wanted to know what he had to say since he had gone to the trouble of being assigned with her for the case.<br>
<br>
“Hey, I think I found something, possible murder weapon,” Warrick said from the other room. Sara rushed into the bedroom, but only saw Warrick holding a half-eaten lollipop in his hand. She looked confused momentarily, and then cocked her eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Warrick, that’s a lollipop,” she stated. He smiled and shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Death by chocolate?” He asked innocently. Sara shook her head.<br>
<br>
“Death by blunt force trauma. I’m pretty sure candy doesn’t leave big pools of blood on the carpet.” She giggled, and then regained composure. She stepped closer to look at the lollipop. “Hey! And it’s not even chocolate, it’s like, root beer or something,” she scrunched up her nose and made a disgusted look. “What’s going on with you?”<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?” He asked as he continued to collect evidence from the room, making sure to bag the lollipop for possible DNA not belonging to the victim.<br>
<br>
“Why did you ask to be partnered with me tonight?” She asked with an exasperated sigh.<br>
<br>
“Like I said, I needed to talk to you,” he commented, but didn’t look at her.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, and you haven’t. So what’s up?” Warrick stopped what he was doing so he could look at her, but then resumed looking around the room.<br>
<br>
“Ooh, can you get a picture of this?” He asked her, pointing to something slightly under the bed. She nodded, and came over to him, crouching down to get a better view with the camera.<br>
<br>
“What is that?” She asked, a small look of horror in her eyes.<br>
<br>
“It’s blood.”<br>
<br>
“No, I meant the design,” she said. Warrick shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Don’t know yet, that’s why we need the picture,” he said, tapping the top of the camera. She shot him a look and he grinned. Someone had taken what was presumably the victim’s blood and drawn a design on the carpet. “Hope this doesn’t turn into a serial killer,” he said, shaking his head. Sara made a humph sound.<br>
<br>
“Well, you know if they went to all the trouble to draw with blood that it probably will,” she said, turning her eyes toward him, giving him a small smile. “I think we’ve got everything here for now, we should head back and report.” Warrick nodded.<br>
<br>
“Okay,” he replied. They started to pack up their various swabs and bags and got into the car. The car drive back to the lab seemed to be taking longer than the drive over. “I wanted to ask if you had plans on Tuesday,” Warrick said casually, not even looking over at Sara. She turned her head to see his eyes still fixed on the road.<br>
<br>
“Tuesday’s my day off,” she said, a little confused by his question. Warrick grinned at this, and turned to face her as they pulled up to a red light.<br>
<br>
“I’m aware of that,” he said smugly, “otherwise I would already know what your plans were.” Sara smiled.<br>
<br>
“Why do you want to know?”<br>
<br>
“Just thought we could go to dinner or something,” he said, taking his eyes off of her and driving again. That caught her off guard.<br>
<br>
“Why me?” She asked. Then she decided to push her luck. “Trying to make Catherine jealous? Because I don’t think it will work.” Warrick eyed her with an unreadable look.<br>
<br>
“No. It just seems like we’ve been getting along better at work, and since we both have Tuesday off, I thought I’d try and make an effort to be friends,” he explained calmly. A surge of guilt passed through Sara.<br>
<br>
‘Geez. Be more of a bitch why don’t you Sara? Here he is offering the proverbial olive branch and you’re teasing him about Catherine.’ She gave him a little smile and said, “Oh.” Then after an awkward pause, she added, “Okay, that sounds good.” Warrick looked over at her and grinned. They pulled into the parking lot.<br>
<br>
“Let’s get this stuff in,” he said, and then noted, “Must have been a worse crime scene the others went on, they’re not back yet.” The expression on his face was solemn. Sara frowned, and they headed into the building.<br>
<br>
When they got to the lab, there was an unfriendly face there to meet them. Greg gave them an ‘I’m sorry’ look and then their attention turned to the visitor.<br>
<br>
“Hey Ecklie,” Sara mustered a monotone greeting. Warrick just gave him a nod of acknowledgment. Ecklie looked very stressed, but still retained his smug demeanor.<br>
<br>
“Ms. Sidle,” Ecklie greeted her, leering at her body, and she cringed. Warrick wasn’t comfortable with the way Ecklie looked Sara, though he tried to reason that he wouldn’t be comfortable with Ecklie looking that way at anyone.<br>
<br>
“What do you want?” Warrick asked gruffly. He quickly added, “Grissom’s not back yet.” Ecklie briefly glanced at Warrick, then returned his eyes to Sara, who was slowly and subconsciously edging closer to Warrick’s more muscular form.<br>
<br>
“Actually, I came to speak with Ms. Sidle,” Ecklie sneered.<br>
<br>
“About?” Sara asked. She could only stand to be in the same room with the man for a limited amount of time, and that time was almost up, especially the way he was looking at her.<br>
<br>
“Day shift is going to be having an opening come open in about a month, I thought you might like to be transferred.” Sara looked at him in shock, but came up with a response quickly.<br>
<br>
“Would it mean working with you?” She asked. He nodded.<br>
<br>
“Of course.”<br>
<br>
“Then no,” she stated, shaking her head vehemently. Warrick and Greg both had to suppress laughing. Ecklie didn’t seem phased. He just gave her a smile as he started to walk out of the lab.<br>
<br>
“Just think about it, you could have a normal life again, actually go out on dates,” he said, looking her over one more time, and then he walked into the hallway. Sara’s mouth hung open. It wasn’t often that she was at a loss for words, but this was certainly one of those times. Warrick furrowed his brow. He touched her on the shoulder and told her that he would be right back and to start processing the evidence without him. He met up with Ecklie further down the hall.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” he said, commanding Ecklie’s attention. “That whole thing that just went down in there could be considered sexual harassment, you know?” Ecklie grinned.<br>
<br>
“I don’t see how,” Ecklie feigned innocence. “All I did was offer her a transfer to day shift.” Warrick’s eyes narrowed in a threatening manner.<br>
<br>
“You were undressing her with your eyes the entire time, even I felt uncomfortable. Don’t let it happen again,” Warrick warned, and started back to the lab. A few steps later, he turned back to Ecklie. “And about the dating thing, Sara’s taken.” With that, he went back to the lab, leaving a contemplative Ecklie in his wake, as well as a stunned Grissom, who had just come into the building.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
The next evening, Grissom came into work to see Sara already there, which was no big surprise since it seemed that she practically lived there. What was surprising is that Warrick was there too, and he had apparently just said something to her that made her giggle. Grissom was stunned. He had thought that Sara and he had something special, an unspoken connection, and although he had admittedly been slow to pursue it because of his position as her boss, and his social awkwardness, he thought that she would always be there. He had never imagined that she would actually have that sort of connection with anyone else, especially not Warrick, given their less than ideal history.<br>
<br>
“What’s so funny?” Grissom asked dryly. He didn’t really want to know what they were talking about, he just wanted to know what the hell had happened to come in between his and Sara’s burgeoning relationship. Sara saw him standing there and her face lit up.<br>
<br>
“Nothing poptart,” Sara replied, and then she burst out laughing. Warrick was doing his best to hold his laughter in, but finally exploded as well. Grissom stood there looking completely confused, but shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Never mind, I don’t want to know,” he said. “What have you got on the Thomason murder?” Warrick and Sara eyed each other. They knew that Grissom wasn’t going to like the answer to that question.<br>
<br>
“Nada,” Warrick answered. All hair and prints at the scene belong to the vic, the only thing we might have is a half sucked lollipop that suggests the perp is male, or whoever had the lollipop is male.”<br>
<br>
“And so far we have nothing on the design the killer drew in blood,” Sara chimed in. “I’ve been trying to match it against everything I can think of, and so far nothing, but I’ll keep on it.” Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
‘Okay, this is okay. They’re probably just getting to be friends, and Warrick was just trying to keep Ecklie away from Sara. Rational explanation for everything, my world isn’t falling apart.’ Grissom thought.<br>
<br>
“So where do you want to eat tomorrow?” Warrick asked Sara. Grissom’s head shot up from the paperwork he had been rifling through.<br>
<br>
“What?” He asked, in a more startled voice than he wanted to let forth.<br>
<br>
“Oh, since Sara and I both have tomorrow off, we decided to go to dinner. You know, get to know each other better,” Warrick explained. Grissom’s mouth dropped open slightly, but he nodded, not wanting to betray his inner feelings.<br>
<br>
‘Note to self, never schedule them for the same days off again,’ Grissom mentally slapped himself. “Ah,” is all he can get out.<br>
<br>
“Someplace with asparagus, for some reason I’ve been craving that lately.” Warrick nodded. “So how’s your case going Grissom?” Sara asked, genuinely interested, and desperately wanting a change of topic. He observed her big smile, the one she uses just with him, and the tone in her voice, and maybe he was making a big deal out of nothing. Grissom sighs.<br>
<br>
“Cut and dry, kind of wishing I had gone to the other one with you,” he said. Warrick grins, but Grissom misses it, his eyes focused on Sara. She grins as well, and then nods.<br>
<br>
“I wish you would have too,” she stated, in a quieter voice than usual. She’s glad that Grissom seemed to be paying attention to her again. It seemed for a while there that he had been distracted, or had just lost interest in flirting with her. The mood was ruined when Nick came into the room, smiling broadly, and waving lab results around.<br>
<br>
“I was right!” He proclaimed, smacking the papers down on the table. Grissom barely tipped his head to the side and looked at him. Nick’s smile faded to a grin as he explained. “The murderer was her boyfriend, I was right.”<br>
<br>
“There were two sets of footprints at the scene Nick,” Grissom started, but Nick just shrugged.<br>
<br>
“My best guess is he got his brother or a friend to help him move the body to the bedroom,” his light drawl smoothly going over the words. “Although, I’m not sure why. Like nobody’s going to notice the big blood splatters on the living room wall and carpet? Come on!” He shook his head. Grissom shot him a look, and Nick ducked his head and sighed. “I know, I know, find out who the other guy was.”<br>
<br>
“And if it was a guy,” Grissom added. Nick rolled his eyes grabbed a coke from the refrigerator, and then sat down next to Warrick.<br>
<br>
“How’s your case going?” Warrick and Sara looked at each other. Warrick shook his head slightly.<br>
<br>
“Not good. No prints, no nothing. The only thing this guy left us is a sucker, and we don’t even know if it belonged to the killer,” he answered. Nick smiled, still under a bit of a rush about being right about their suspect.<br>
<br>
“Hey! He left you candy, nice.” Sara laughed.<br>
<br>
“Would have been nicer if he hadn’t had half of it first,” she said.<br>
<br>
“But then you wouldn’t have his lovely DNA all over it, and then how would you catch him?” Nick jested. Then, the photo of the drawing with blood caught his eye. “What’s this?” Warrick buried his face in his hands. Although his plan to get Grissom and Sara to admit their feelings seemed to be on track, he hadn’t been sleeping well, and this case that left little evidence wasn’t helping.<br>
<br>
“Killer’s an artist,” Sara answered. Nick looked up at her and raised his eyebrows.<br>
<br>
“Or something else,” Nick said. Sara furrowed her brow.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
<br>
“Looks like the symbol for one of the teams on Galactic War Games, that internet site,” Nick explained. Sara and Warrick both looked at him with wide eyes. “What? I have nephews, the last time I went for a visit, they were playing on the site.” Grissom seemed interested.<br>
<br>
“So someone’s trying to play in the real world?” He asked, although it came out as more of a statement. “Sara…” She was already up from the table and about to leave.<br>
<br>
“I know, going to get a warrant for the list of online players’ real life names now,” she said, brushing past him. He grinned. At least she could still read his mind.<br>
<br>
“Damn,” Warrick said as he got up. “I was hoping it was Ecklie,” he said jokingly, and walked past Grissom. Nick started laughing.<br>
<br>
“It still could be,” he half shouted after him, getting up to leave. Grissom looked at him. “Well, it could,” Nick smiled and went back to work. Grissom face grew a slight grin as he pondered what Nick had said. Then he shook it off.<br>
<br>
“I couldn’t be that lucky.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Three hours later, Warrick and Sara walked into Grissom’s office. He looked up at them briefly, and then returned to his paperwork.<br>
<br>
“Aren’t you even going to ask what we found?” Sara beamed. He stilled his pen and cast his eyes upon her face, giving her a small grin.<br>
<br>
“What did you find?” His voice was calm, reasoned.<br>
<br>
“Only two matches for all of Nevada, and one of them is an eight year old,” Warrick answered. Grissom gave Sara a look.<br>
<br>
“Of course, we’re going to check out both leads just in case he lied about his age, right Warrick?” She managed to ramble out. She knew that’s what Grissom would say to do next, they were still in sync, or so she kept telling herself. Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
“Get to it then,” he said and then his head bowed down to look at his paperwork again, as if no further conversation was needed. Warrick and Sara left the office.<br>
<br>
“You wanna split up? We could actually get this done tonight if we do,” Sara asked, her eyes shining brightly. Warrick eyed her, as if thinking about the answer, even though he knew there could only be one he could give.<br>
<br>
“Better not,” he shook his head. If you get the eight year old who turns out not to be an eight year old, but a psychopath, then you die. If you get the 34 year old who turns out to be the killer, then you die. Either way, I’ll die, because Grissom will have my head, and I like life. Living is a good thing.” Sara suppressed a giggle.<br>
<br>
“Grissom wouldn’t blame you, he knows I can be stubborn,” she reasoned.<br>
<br>
“Somehow, I don’t think he’ll take that as an excuse,” he paused, opening up the passenger door on the car. “Your chariot awaits m’lady.” Sara sighed. She knew she wasn’t going to win this argument, and especially hated losing to Warrick. He had become a more formidable opponent as of late.<br>
<br>
“Fine, let’s just hurry,” she said, seating herself in the passenger’s seat. Warrick leaned his arm on the open door and arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Why? Got a hot date?” Sara laughed.<br>
<br>
“Nope, not until tomorrow,” she smiled and winked her eye. Warrick laughed. Not because he and Sara were supposed to be having dinner the next evening, but because he knew something she didn’t know, he knew the plan. He got in the car and they began driving to the 34 year old, Steven MacAbee’s, house. Not because they considered him the more viable suspect, but because it was closer, and as luck would have it, in the same direction as the 8 year old, Jimmy Estes’s, house. Sara decided to break the silence that had accompanied the ride so far, since Warrick had swatted her hand away from the radio at the very beginning of the trip.<br>
<br>
“So, you and I going to dinner and everything,” Sara paused and tried to think of what to say next, at least in a tactful manner.<br>
<br>
“Uh-huh,” was the only response elicited. Sara rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“You should wait for me to finish the sentence before you start adding in comments to make it sound like you’re actually listening.” Warrick briefly looked at her. Sara grinned; at least he was paying attention. “Anyway, like I was starting to say, when are you going to get around to asking Catherine out?” Warrick swung his head around and stared at her. “Eyes on the road, I don’t want to crash.” He looked back at the road and continued to drive.<br>
<br>
“When am I going to ask Catherine out hmm? When are you going to ask Grissom out?” Sara’s eyes grew large and she started looking back and forth.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she pushed the words out of her mouth. ‘God, that didn’t sound unnatural, I’m so screwed.’ Warrick didn’t look at her this time, but a small grin came across his lips.<br>
<br>
“Uh-huh, sure you don’t.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t.” Sara said shaking her head slightly. “And even if I did, it’s not the woman’s responsibility to do the asking.” Warrick laughed. “What?”<br>
<br>
“You really have been out of the whole dating scene for a while haven’t you? And besides, you asked Hank out.” Warrick pulled the car up to the curb in front of Steven MacAbee’s house. Sara’s jaw dropped. Warrick got out of the car with his supplies, leaving a stunned Sara still sitting in the car for a moment. She furrowed her eyebrows and got up.<br>
<br>
“Hey!” She shot back, jokingly punching him in the arm. “I thought you wanted to try and be friends?” She arched an eyebrow and smiled. Warrick returned the gesture.<br>
<br>
“Part of friendship is honesty,” he said as they walked up to the door. Sara rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Thanks Buddha.” Warrick creased his eyebrows down and placed a hand on his belly. Sara laughed.<br>
<br>
“That’s not funny. I’ll have you know I’ve been working out every day, and I’m pretty sure Buddha didn’t have a six pack,” he reasoned. Sara was still smiling when she rang the doorbell.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, or your unique sense of modesty,” she tilted her head to the side, then back up when there came an answer to the door. A boy around 10 years old answered the door.<br>
<br>
“Hi. My name is Warrick, this is Sara, we’re with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. We’re looking for Steven MacAbee.” The boy didn’t look stunned or impressed, he looked condescending.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, that’s me. What do you want?” Sara raised her eyebrows at the child’s obviously snotty behavior.<br>
<br>
“Does your father have the same name as you?” She asked, trying to lighten the mood a little bit, she gave a small grin.<br>
<br>
“No.” He didn’t elaborate. Warrick and Sara looked at each other.<br>
<br>
“Think we got the data mixed up somehow?” Warrick asked. Sara shrugged.<br>
<br>
“I don’t see how.” She turned her attention back to the boy. “Are you part of an online gaming community called ‘Galactic War Games’?” The boy’s mood brightened considerably.<br>
<br>
“Yeah baby! Rogue Delta’s rule!” He made a little movement with his hand and had an excited smile plastered on his face.<br>
<br>
“Um, the site gave your age as 34,” she said, a little confused. MacAbee rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Duh. Mom won’t let me do anything online unless I give an adult age so someone doesn’t try to come and get me,” he explained to her like she didn’t have a clue what was going on in the real world. Warrick rubbed his temple with his left hand.<br>
<br>
“Damn. Okay, other guy then?” He looked at Sara, disappointed. She gave him a consolation smile and nodded. “Okay, that’s all, thanks for your help Steven.” Steven put a smile back on.<br>
<br>
“No problem. Rogue Delta’s rule baby!” He made the motion with his hand again and then shut the door. Sara sighed and they started walking back to the car.<br>
<br>
“If someone was coming to get him, it would be to kill the obnoxious little twerp,” she mumbled. Warrick smiled.<br>
<br>
“Be nice.”<br>
<br>
“I was being nice.”<br>
<br>
The drive to Jimmy Estes’s house was a little longer than expected due to traffic.<br>
<br>
“What are you thinking?” Warrick cast an eye over Sara’s worried features. She looked so happy when they had arrived at the first house, and now she looked so concerned.<br>
<br>
“I’m thinking that if MacAbee lied about his age then pretty much anybody who used the site could do the same thing, and if that’s the case, maybe they can lie about their location too.” She sighed. Their first real break on the case was turning into a goose chase, and she was getting frustrated. Warrick nodded.<br>
<br>
“Would it help if I said I have a special surprise for you tomorrow night?” Sara’s head turned from the window to look at Warrick, who proceeded to waggle his eyebrows at her. She looked at him like he was crazy, but then smiled. He wanted to play, she could play.<br>
<br>
“How special?” At the tone in her voice, he gripped the wheel a little bit tighter than he had been holding it.<br>
<br>
“If you’ll recall, I also said surprise, which means that I can’t say anything else about it,” he sloughed off her previous comment. He could handle this. Things were getting a little more complicated than he had hoped for. His plan had just been to make Grissom a bit jealous, enough to start progressing his relationship with Sara, and enough for Warrick to play mind games with Grissom. No harm in that right? Now he was thinking that he should have told someone else about the plan, namely Sara. She was a little too good at harmless flirting for someone who was supposedly socially awkward. It would be dangerous for him to develop feelings for her, especially knowing how Grissom felt. Life would be hell.<br>
<br>
Warrick spotted the turnoff and they headed toward Jimmy Estes’s house. They had already informed backup about the Steven MacAbee situation, so they were getting ready to come to the house in a short amount of time, just in case they were needed. As they pulled up to the house, a sense of dread encompassed Sara. The lawn was unkempt, two of the windows had boards over them, the paint was faded and chipping, and overall it looked like it had been abandoned. Warrick looked at her. They started their walk to the door, which didn’t look at all welcoming.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know about you, but when I was eight, I had chores,” he stated, nodding his head to the dry, dead, weedy lawn.<br>
<br>
“Tell me about it, I’m thinking Jimmy Estes,” she emphasized his name with a definitive disfavor, “either doesn’t live here, or…”<br>
<br>
“Or he’s an over 18 whack job,” Warrick finished. Sara looked at him and nodded. They rang the bell. After a couple more rings and a knock, the door opened. In the doorway stood a tall, seedy looking man, with stringy brown hair, and a stench that smelled like he hadn’t bathed in a few days. “Hi, my name is Warrick…”<br>
<br>
“You cops?” The man asked. Uncertainty filled Sara’s head about how she should respond to the man. If they said they weren’t, surely they would get more information, or they would just get themselves killed.<br>
<br>
“We’re criminalists, we work for the police department,” she stated. Warrick moved a hand to the small of her back to steady her. “We’re looking for Jimmy Estes.”<br>
<br>
“You found him.”<br>
<br>
“I see. The records we have for an online game site called ‘Galactic War Games’ say that the Jimmy Estes we’re looking for is eight years old. Do you have a son in your home?” Sara questioned as she eyed the man. He wasn’t acting how she expected he would after first seeing his appearance. Then, the seedy man smiled. His teeth dirty and rotting, Sara and Warrick had to both hold back a cringe.<br>
<br>
“Doesn’t live here, lives with his mom. He set up the account under my address so he could play the game, his mom doesn’t like that sort of thing.” Sara and Warrick nodded as Warrick took notes. “So, you’re here for my kid huh?” Sara looked at him again, he had an unreadable expression on his face, but it wasn’t a good one, it looked almost evil.<br>
<br>
Sara decided to slightly change the topic.<br>
<br>
“Why did you think we were police officers Mr. Estes? Were you expecting the police?” He had no reaction other than to stare at her. She became a little unnerved under his stare, but didn’t turn her eyes away. She wasn’t going to let some loser make her afraid of doing her job.<br>
<br>
“Only people that ever dare come up to the door are my kid and cops,” he slowly rolled the sentence off his tongue. To Warrick, it almost sounded rehearsed. He furrowed his brow. Then, Estes did something that would allow them to get a warrant to search his house. He leaned his left arm up against the door and his jacket opened to expose a t-shirt with the same design the killer left at their crime scene. Sara and Warrick looked at each other.<br>
<br>
“You want to tell us why you’re wearing a t-shirt with the design from a game that you said your son signed up for?” Warrick asked. As if he read Warrick’s mind, he looked down and then looked at Sara.<br>
<br>
“You can call all the backup you want sweet pea, I’m immune from prosecution,” He drew out the last part of his sentence as he leered at Sara in a hungry manner. Warrick cocked an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“You a diplomat or something?” He asked, knowing full well that the man standing in front of them wasn’t anything close to a diplomat. “Because if you are, you haven’t shown us your papers, which means we can arrest you.” Estes rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“No, but I got friends.” Warrick looked at Sara again and nodded. She called for backup and they arrived a little after five minutes later.<br>
<br>
“How’d you guys get here so fast? It took us forever,” Sara commented to one of the officers. He smiled and gave a shrug. They proceeded to arrest Jimmy Estes, or at least, the man they thought was Jimmy Estes.<br>
<br>
Warrick and Sara began the drive back to the lab.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
When they reached the building, Grissom was standing in the doorway waiting for them.<br>
<br>
“I thought you two would be going through his house right now.” He made a characteristic Grissom face and Sara rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“And that’s why you’re standing there waiting for us right?” Warrick asked sarcastically. Grissom shot him a warning look.<br>
<br>
“We decided to wait until morning, get Nick and Catherine to help so we can get it done faster,” she said, grinning at him. Following an uncomfortable pause, she said, “It’s been a long last couple of days, I’m going to go turn in these samples and notes.” Warrick nodded his head once, but stayed where he was. Grissom looked back at him.<br>
<br>
“This wouldn’t have anything to do with your date tomorrow night?” He asked, trying to keep his jealousy, or any other emotion from running into his words. Warrick grinned.<br>
<br>
“It’s not a date.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t want you to feel like you have to hide things from me, I overheard you talking to Ecklie the other night.” Grissom looked hurt. He was trying to hide it, he wanted to be happy for them, but he couldn’t, not yet.<br>
<br>
“What exactly did you hear?” Warrick’s demeanor turned serious.<br>
<br>
“I heard you say that she was taken,” Grissom said in a low voice, almost a whisper. His head was down, not wanting to deal with the situation he believed to be in front of him. Warrick rubbed his eyes and looked at Grissom.<br>
<br>
“He was harassing her.” Grissom’s eyes shot up.<br>
<br>
“What?!”<br>
<br>
“He was harassing her. He asked her if she wanted to move to day shift, was looking at her like he wanted to rape her the entire time, and when she turned him down he made some cracks about her needing to get a normal life again, start dating,” Warrick explained.<br>
<br>
“So what did you tell him?”<br>
<br>
“I told him to knock it off, that if it ever happened again that I’d report him, then I added that she was taken, that’s it.” Grissom looked stunned. He had never liked Ecklie, and he was sure the feeling was mutual, but he didn’t think Ecklie would stoop so low as to harass Sara to get back at him. Or, rather, he hadn’t thought about it at all. He tried to think of Ecklie as little as possible.<br>
<br>
“Is it true?”<br>
<br>
“I just told you everything that happened, it’s the truth Gris.” Grissom shook his head and looked at Warrick with a sorrowful expression.<br>
<br>
“Is it true that she’s taken?” He barely managed to get it out. He had been suffering for the last couple of days over the possibility that the soul mate he had finally found was moving on with her life because she didn’t know or didn’t care how he felt about her. Warrick smiled. His plan was working. He shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Don’t know. Like I said,” he started to make his way past Grissom, “it’s not a date, it’s just a get to know you thing.” He cocked his head to the side. “You want me to ask her?” Warrick kept a solemn expression on his face to make his emotions and motives unreadable. Grissom just stared at him blankly.<br>
<br>
“If you don’t know then why did you tell Ecklie that she was taken?” He asked, trying to get Warrick to admit to something, anything, that would give him some insight as to what was really going on. Warrick sighed.<br>
<br>
“I just thought it might help get rid of him for a while.” Warrick stopped talking and purposely averted his eyes from Grissom’s when he continued. “Sara’s right. It has been a long last couple of days, at least for us, and I’m gonna go home and get some shut-eye before I have to be at the scene tomorrow.” He walked away from Grissom toward the lockers, the grumbling in his head persistent. ‘This is getting way too complicated, I need to find a way to stop it.’<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
The next morning, Warrick and Sara were accompanied with Nick and Catherine, and all four were scouring through Estes’s house, but there was nothing there. Literally. There was one makeshift bed, which was just a mattress on the floor with a blanket, a chair, some food delivery containers, and a cell phone. It didn’t look like he had been living there very long, if he had been living there at all. They swabbed and bagged what they could, and left to go back to the lab. Nick opted to ride with Sara, citing that he hadn’t gotten much of a chance to talk to her lately and wanted to see how the case was going, but with the actual ulterior motive of trying to get information about her possible relationship with Warrick. She agreed to go with him, because it meant Warrick had to ride with Catherine. Which, she knew he would love, and she would be able to tease him about later.<br>
<br>
“Okay Sara, you wanna tell me what’s really going on?” Nick glanced at Sara as he was driving. Sara took notice of the smirk that covered his face and smiled.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she feigned innocence and looked the other direction. When she looked back at him, he was looking at her with a ‘yeah, right’ expression. She beamed a blinding smile. “Scout’s honor.” She made the scout sign.<br>
<br>
“Wow, and I really believe you too Sara,” he said, sarcasm dripping off his every note. “Let’s review the evidence in this case shall we?” She eyed him suspiciously. “First, we have a dry spell at work, only to happen upon a wiggy case where the suspect apparently wasn’t living where he was living and has no obvious motive.” Sara nodded. “But that’s not even the weird part. The weird part is that Warrick specifically asked to be assigned as your partner on this case, and apart from only a few times when I have ever seen you two be friendly with each other, usually at my expense, I have never seen you act in more than a civil manner toward each other.”<br>
<br>
“What are you implying?” Sara interrupted.<br>
<br>
“I’m implying that there’s usually more than meets the eye,” he said, waiting for a response from Sara, but receiving none, he continued. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile as much as you have these last couple of days. Well, unless you’re being complimented by Grissom on what a good job you’ve done.” He rolled his eyes. “Teacher’s pet.” Sara turned away from him so he couldn’t see the blush rising to her cheeks. “Anyway, if you two are seeing each other I think I have a right to know.”<br>
<br>
Sara whipped her head around, her eyes large.<br>
<br>
“Wha…?” She started stammering. “I’m not seeing Grissom, he’s…” She tried to come up with a viable reason that she wouldn’t be seeing Grissom, the one man that she really wanted to be seeing. Nick’s eyes grew big and then he started laughing.<br>
<br>
“God Sara! No! I meant you and Warrick,” he explained, still laughing. Sara covered her embarrassed face with her hand and shook her head, waiting for the red color to flush.<br>
<br>
“Oh, man.” Nick said, stifling another chuckle. “You realize I’m going to have to tell him you said that though right? Gris’ll have a fit.” Sara’s eyes went large again as she realized Nick’s implication.<br>
<br>
“You wouldn’t.” It came out as more of a question than Sara would have liked. Nick just grinned.<br>
<br>
“Not if you tell me what’s actually going on with you and Warrick,” he smiled mischievously. “Come on, I thought we had that whole brother sister dynamic going on.” He peeked a sideways look at her.” Sara grumbled and frumped into her seat.<br>
<br>
“Yeah. The brother I never had and never wanted.” She mumbled as she leaned her face against her palm. Nick laughed again.<br>
<br>
“Oh, now don’t say that. You know you love me sis,” Nick teased. Sara looked at him.<br>
<br>
“You’re not going to start calling me that are you?”<br>
<br>
“You’d better believe it,” Nick chuckled and then flashed her a smile. She groaned, but smiled back. Nick paused. “So you’re really not going to tell me?” He feigned being emotionally hurt at her unwillingness to share. “Come on, you know you want to.”<br>
<br>
“There’s nothing to tell,” she shook her head a little. “You have the wrong idea. He just wants us to be friends.” Nick raised his eyebrow in a cocky manner.<br>
<br>
“Was that your idea or his?” He asked in an implied tone. Sara glared at him.<br>
<br>
“His, but you really do have the wrong idea. He just thought since we’d been getting along better lately that maybe we could try being friends.” Nick grinned.<br>
<br>
“Uh-huh.”<br>
<br>
“It’s the truth Nick.”<br>
<br>
“I believe you Sara,” he said, trying to keep a straight face, but then bursting into what could only be described as a man’s version of giggling. Sara rolled her eyes, but then gave into a faint smile.<br>
<br>
“You believe me and yet you’re laughing at me?”<br>
<br>
“I believe that’s what he told you,” he said in an honest manner, but still with the underlying tone that he didn’t believe that’s what Warrick actually wanted. Sara sighed.<br>
<br>
“Whatever.” Nick just smiled as they pulled up to the building.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“So you got anything for us Greg?” Nick asked as he dumped more evidence bags into Greg’s inbox and smiled. Greg didn’t even look at the work that he had accumulated. He was obviously happy and nodded confidently.<br>
<br>
“Yes indeed. First of all, Chris Edwards, parolee extraordinaire, left your second shoeprints. He left his fingerprints all over the crime scene, along with the other guy, and according to his file, it’s his shoe size.” Greg rambled off.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but lots of guys have that shoe size right?” Sara asked, not really knowing a lot about Nick’s case.<br>
<br>
“A size 17? Uh, no.” Greg answered.<br>
<br>
“Oh.” Sara hadn’t realized the shoeprints had been so large.<br>
<br>
“You know what they say about guys with big feet right? Cuz’ I’m a size…” he directed at Sara.<br>
<br>
“Greg?” Nick interrupted.<br>
<br>
“Yeah?”<br>
<br>
“Shut up.” Nick said matter-of-factly. Greg opened and closed his mouth and then just nodded.<br>
<br>
“Right.” He said. “Okay, and then on your case Sara, it gets weird.” Sara nodded.<br>
<br>
“Of course it does.”<br>
<br>
“This Jimmy Estes that was brought in, his prints came up as someone else. Don’t know if he changed his name or what, but…”<br>
<br>
“What name?” Sara asked, now more interested in what Greg was saying.<br>
<br>
“I was just getting to that if you’d let me finish a sentence.” Nick gave him a warning look. “Right, bully the guy who ends up processing all your case breaking evidence, you know, someday you guys will learn to appreciate me.” He looked at Nick and Sara’s glares and sighed. “Stuart Fellowes. But that’s not the X-Files conspiracy theory part. He’s been in jail for the last 6 months, and then got sprung when the forensics department, our very own daytime forensics department, suddenly came up with some evidence i.d.ing somebody else for the crime.” Greg leaned back in his chair, proud of his findings. Sara and Nick looked at each other, clearly stunned.<br>
<br>
“Who came up with the evidence?” Sara asked.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, and since when do they get to work cases that have already been put to court when they already have new assignments? We don’t get to do that,” Nick added. Greg gave a sympathetic grin.<br>
<br>
“Well, Ecklie’s the one who signed off on it. Grissom would have to give the final say-so, but I couldn’t find his name anywhere on the paperwork. Could still be in processing,” Greg pondered. Sara shook her head.<br>
<br>
“No. If it was still in processing, then he wouldn’t have been released. Must have been like Estes, or, Fellowes, said. He’s got friends.” She was visibly rattled by the information. What had started out as a joke between her and Warrick was looking like a real possibility. Maybe Ecklie wasn’t responsible for the murder, but he was certainly involved somehow. She looked at Nick again and he nodded. ‘Too much telepathy going on in this place.’ She laughed in her head, but not out loud.<br>
<br>
“We need to tell Grissom,” Nick stated.<br>
<br>
“You need me to call Brass for a warrant or anything?” Greg asked. He so wanted to be part of their investigation, other than just the smart guy in the lab. He wanted to feel involved. Nick flashed a knowing grin.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, it’ll just save Grissom the time,” Nick said as he and Sara started to walk out of the lab. After walking down the hall, they arrived at Grissom’s office, the door to which was open. He was sitting in his chair looking at paperwork.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” Sara greeted. Grissom looked up. “Thought you worked the night shift,” she kidded.<br>
<br>
“Last time I checked, so did you,” he snapped back. Her previous expression of happiness to see him, to tell him what they had found out, quickly changed to remorse. She didn’t know why he seemed to be shutting her out again lately. She started to think she should have let Nick tell him the news himself. Nick, noticing the friction, decided to continue the conversation.<br>
<br>
“Greg found us some interesting information,” he said. Grissom stayed silent, but attentive. He listened as Nick filled him in on everything they had just found out. Grissom rubbed his palms over his face, and then started to massage his temples.<br>
<br>
“Okay. You call Brass?” Nick nodded.<br>
<br>
“Greg said he would call him, I’m sure he’ll be over in no time,” Nick responded. Sara had remained quiet, when usually she would be very excited to share the information. She looked at the ground, and then at the door, but avoiding Grissom’s face.<br>
<br>
“I should get home, I need to get some sleep.” Without waiting for a response from either of the two men, she left the office. Nick looked at Grissom’s fallen features as Sara left. It just then clicked for him, what Grissom’s feelings for Sara actually were.<br>
<br>
“She said they’re just friends, or trying to be friends,” he tried to comfort his boss. Grissom raised his eyes to look at him, and stood up. He started rifling through a book, not looking for anything in particular.<br>
<br>
“And you believe her?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know. I didn’t at first, and I still don’t know if I do. Either way, you should be happy for her.” Grissom glared an unbelieving glare at Nick. “You wanted her to get more involved with a life outside of work right? You were complaining that she was here twenty four hours a day.”<br>
<br>
“I wasn’t complaining, just observing.”<br>
<br>
“I’m not the one you need to tell that to.” Nick shook his head as Grissom went to sit down again. “You should tell Warrick how you feel about Sara.” Another warning look was shot at him. “Not that you feel any particular way,” Nick covered, “but if you do, you should tell him. I’m sure he’d back off.” Grissom sighed and resumed going through his paperwork.<br>
<br>
“Right now it looks like I have more important things to be concerned with,” Grissom responded in an evasive answer. Nick gave a thoughtful nod.<br>
<br>
“Yeah.” Nick turned to leave. “But you shouldn’t put the rest of your life on hold either Gris. It’s not healthy.” He left without turning to face the man looking at him from the desk. Grissom just sat there, and within moments of Nick leaving, he shoved his face into his hands.<br>
<br>
“You beckoned?” Ecklie asked as he strolled into Grissom’s office. He showed little to no respect for Grissom, as he saw him as the only reason he didn’t get the position that Grissom currently held. Grissom gave him a stern look, but underneath it, Ecklie could see Grissom’s weary features, and decided to use it to his advantage. Grissom shoved a photocopy of the papers Ecklie had signed at him.<br>
<br>
“Can you explain this?” Ecklie picked up the papers and briefly scanned them with his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Nothing to explain.” He shrugged, but avoided eye contact with Grissom. It was much easier for him to lie to people if he didn’t have to look directly at them, so he pretended to still be looking at the papers. “New evidence came in on my shift, and I signed the papers.” Grissom just stared at him.<br>
<br>
“You do realize that I’m your supervisor and that this should have been run past me to sign?” Grissom asked in a condescending tone. This caught Ecklie’s attention, and he glared angrily at Grissom.<br>
<br>
“I’m in charge of the day shift, it came in on the day shift. Case closed. I’m good at my job, I don’t need you to tell me how to do it,” Ecklie responded in an indignant fashion.<br>
<br>
“Well, apparently you do. The guy you helped set free is now a suspect in a murder investigation.” Ecklie raised his eyebrows, but quickly regained his composure.<br>
<br>
“What? So you’re saying it’s my fault that this guy went out and killed somebody? Come on, you know better than that. A high percentage of guys who go to jail or prison commit more violent crimes once they come out. It’s the system.” Ecklie reasoned, although his tone was apparent, and Grissom was surprised.<br>
<br>
“And we’re the part of the system that’s supposed to prevent against that sort of thing happening.” Grissom sighed. “I’m just giving you the heads up as a courtesy, but a formal investigation is being launched against you and,” Grissom paused to look at the name of the investigator who brought in the evidence, “Roberts. Roberts? Who is Roberts?” His brow furrowed and he glared at Ecklie. Ecklie shrugged.<br>
<br>
“He’s new,” Ecklie responded in an uncaring voice. Grissom tilted his head.<br>
<br>
“I don’t remember approving anyone new for your department,” he said. Ecklie stared at him.<br>
<br>
“You didn’t. The request and approval were put in before you were made our commander and chief,” he shot back. “And a formal investigation is a waste of time, everything was done by the book. I hardly think one missed signature is the end of the world.” Ecklie tried to play it cool, but Grissom could see the thin layer of sweat developing on the man’s face. Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
“We’ll see.” Ecklie got up to leave, but turned around to face Grissom before heading out the door.<br>
<br>
“Oh, just so you know, I asked Sidle if she’d be interested in transferring to days when the opening comes up in the next month.” Grissom glared angrily at him. Ecklie smiled. His statement had elicited the response he was looking for. “Just trying to keep you in the loop.” He left the office and a seething Grissom behind him.<br>

Her inner voice was gnawing at her. Too many questions. Why was Grissom suddenly shutting her out again? Why was this case bugging her so much? What if the get to know you thing was more than that? She felt like she was drowning, and for someone who so used to being in control, or at least used to maintaining the illusion of control, that was a very unsettling situation to be in. Her phone rang, completely snapping her out of her tossing and turning state.<br>
<br>
“Hello?” Her voice came across more exhausted than she would have liked.<br>
<br>
“Hi Sara, it’s Grissom.” That got her attention. She was suddenly very alert.<br>
<br>
“Hey, what’s up?” She asked, trying to keep it casual. She knew the call would have something to do with work, even though she hoped it didn’t, but any more information on the case would be a good thing too.<br>
<br>
“I know it’s your day off, but I’m going to need you to come into work tonight,” he calmly stated. He wasn’t sure how she was going to take this information. He didn’t want her to think he was getting in the way of her personal life, even though he was, but he rationalized that the case was a justifiable scapegoat.<br>
<br>
“Why?” He sighed. He should have expected her to at least ask why he would be making her come in on her day off, even if under normal circumstances she wouldn’t have.<br>
<br>
“A formal investigation is being launched against Ecklie and Roberts. I need you and Warrick to do everything you can to get your murder case closed up.”<br>
<br>
“So you’re making Warrick come in too?” Grissom briefly shut his eyes, wincing at the image that Sara had just put in his head. ‘Of course, they’re still going to be together, but not on a date, it’s work, and neither one of them would let personal feelings get in the way of their work. They wouldn’t.’ He tried to reassure himself. “Gris? You still there?” Grissom hadn’t realized that he had paused for such a time to give Sara concern.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, still here. And yes, I left a message on Warrick’s machine that he needs to come in tonight too. So get some sleep, because I’m going to need your best tonight.” Sara almost snorted at the double entendre that conjured in her mind.<br>
<br>
“Okay, see you tonight then,” she said, and hung up the phone. Grissom had at least expected a good-bye. He hoped she wouldn’t hold this against him for too long. An angry Sara made for a difficult working environment.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
That evening, Warrick strolled into work. His cool demeanor was apparent as always, but it was obvious that sleep deprivation was starting to take its toll on him. Catherine raised an eyebrow at him as he came into the break room.<br>
<br>
“Hey Catherine,” he greeted, with an upward nod of his head. She looked concerned.<br>
<br>
“I thought you and Sara were going to dinner tonight,” she said, although it came out as more of a question. Warrick raised his eyebrows at her and shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Man, no secrets around this place are there?” He said with a roll of his eyes. “It was just a friend thing,” he started to explain, and Catherine gave him an understanding smile with a look that told him to continue. He shrugged. “Got a message on my machine from Gris saying that he needed me to come in tonight because of the case.” Catherine stared at him, but was contemplating something in her head. This didn’t go unnoticed. “What?”<br>
<br>
“What?” She questioned back, trying to seem innocent. He tilted his head slightly.<br>
<br>
“What aren’t you telling me?” She smiled and got up from her chair. She walked past him to the opening to the hallway and looked both ways to make sure no one was listening, and then she turned back to him.<br>
<br>
“He likes her,” she explained in a calm voice. She wasn’t sure how to talk to Warrick about this. If he liked Sara as more than a friend, then telling him that Grissom did too probably wouldn’t bode well. Warrick surprised her by giving a grin and nodding.<br>
<br>
“I know. Glad I’m not the only one who’s noticed.” Catherine was genuinely taken aback.<br>
<br>
“You know?” She asked almost angrily. “Then why did you ask her out?” Warrick sighed and motioned for her to sit down. She took one last look out into the hallway, and then sat down, directing her attention to Warrick, who had also taken a chair.<br>
<br>
“I asked her as a friend thing,” Warrick paused and smiled. “And to maybe make Grissom jealous enough to take action. Their intermittent flirting was really getting to me for some reason.” Catherine’s eyes grew large, but gleefully so.<br>
<br>
“You planned this?! Oh my God, Warrick!” She looked around again after realizing that she had practically shouted. “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me, you know I would have helped you,” she said a little quieter. Warrick grinned.<br>
<br>
“Well, you still can,” Warrick said, “seeing as how nothing’s happened yet.” A devious smile crawled upon Catherine’s lips and she nodded.<br>
<br>
“I’m in.” Warrick just smiled.<br>
<br>
“You’re in what?” Nick asked casually as he walked into the break room. Catherine and Warrick shot each other an ‘oh, crap’ look and then tried to cover by plastering fake grins on their faces and changing the topic.<br>
<br>
“Hey Nicky,” Catherine greeted. “Didn’t see you there.” He eyed her suspiciously and walked over to where she was sitting. He leaned his hand against the table and hunched over to look directly at her.<br>
<br>
“You’re in what?” He drawled. Catherine still tried to maintain her fake grin and looked over at Warrick for any assistance. He just shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Go ahead, just don’t tell him in the building,” Warrick said, getting up. “Gotta go find Sara, see what else we can dig up on this case.” He walked out the door. Nick cocked an eyebrow at him and then returned his attention to Catherine. He seemed to temporarily put aside what his previous question was.<br>
<br>
“You know what’s going on with them?” He asked Catherine. She got up from her seat and put a hand on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Come on, we’ve got work to do. We can gossip in the car.” She gave him a real smile, which he returned, but with a confused look on his face.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, well, you’d better tell me everything,” he walked quickly to catch up to her. “I hate being the last one to find out about things around here.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Warrick found Sara and Grissom in the lab.<br>
<br>
“Wow, big surprise to see you guys here,” he said sarcastically. Sara smiled and chuckled. Grissom gave him a look that could only be interpreted as territorial. He noticed that Grissom moved closer to Sara after he came in, and he just grinned. “Anything new?” He had already been filled in on the Ecklie situation, but he figured that Sara had come in early, as always, and might have come up with something that he didn’t know yet. Sara beamed.<br>
<br>
“Yep,” she answered. Grissom tried to avoid eye contact with Warrick, and kept his eyes focused on whatever was under the microscope. “And you’re never going to believe it.” Warrick raised an eyebrow. She paused and looked at him, half expecting him to try and guess what the evidence was.<br>
<br>
“You’ve been hanging around Greg too much Sara,” Warrick said, just wanting her to spit out what they had learned.<br>
<br>
“Humph, I wish,” Greg mumbled. Both Warrick and Grissom shot a warning look in his direction. His eyes grew large and he wheeled his chair a little bit in the opposite direction. “What?” Grissom’s eyes squinted at him and Greg turned his attention back to what he was doing. Sara grinned and looked at Warrick, practically oblivious to the interaction that had just taken place in front of her.<br>
<br>
“There was a better DNA sample on the lollipop stick than there was on the candy itself,” Sara smiled. “And you’ll never guess who it matches.” Warrick furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
“Fellowes?” Sara, still smiling, shook her head. Grissom looked up from the microscope at Warrick and grinned.<br>
<br>
“Ecklie,” Grissom stated. Warrick’s eyes grew large in shock. Sara glared at Grissom.<br>
<br>
“I wanted to tell him,” she said, half way hurt. Grissom gave her a soft look and shrugged.<br>
<br>
“You were taking too long.” Sara narrowed her eyes and kiddingly punched him on the arm. He smiled at her. ‘This is good,’ he thought, ‘she doesn’t seem upset that I drug her away from her date, and she’s engaging in adolescent mating ritual behavior with me, maybe she and Warrick really are just friends.’<br>
<br>
“Where did you get a sample of Ecklie’s DNA?” Warrick asked, breaking the moment between Sara and Grissom. Sara turned her attention back to him.<br>
<br>
“Get this, it was already on file from a case four years ago. Apparently he was one of the suspects in an evidence tampering investigation. He was cleared, but the committee still took the suspicion into consideration when they were considering candidates for the job Grissom has now.” Grissom grinned. Sara was smart; she had found the old DNA sample and had the idea to test the lollipop stick as well, all in the hour that she had arrived early for work.<br>
<br>
“So Ecklie killed Thomason?” Warrick asked with surprise. Grissom frowned.<br>
<br>
“Not necessarily.” He shook his head. “But it does mean that he was at the victim’s house…”<br>
<br>
“Which is enough for a warrant for his house,” Sara finished. Grissom grinned again. Working with her felt right. Being with her felt right. She was finishing his thoughts again. Warrick nodded in understanding.<br>
<br>
“Cool.” He looked at Grissom eyeing Sara and decided to put his plan back into action. “So do we still get the rest of the night off?” Grissom’s head whipped around and he turned a little paler.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“Sara and I were supposed to have the night off. Since you have new evidence on Ecklie…” Grissom shot him an authoritative glare and smirked.<br>
<br>
“Nice try Warrick,” Grissom said. “After you get the warrant, I want you and Sara to go over with Brass to Ecklie’s house and get everything you can.” Sara grinned at Grissom.<br>
<br>
“He was just kidding Gris.” Grissom looked at her, she had an honest, almost loving, expression on her face that he would have loved to give in to, but just couldn’t yet, not until he knew for sure that they were just friends.<br>
<br>
“You’d better get going.” Warrick rolled his eyes at Sara and she smiled. She came around the counter to him and latched her arm with his. Grissom’s expression fell.<br>
<br>
“We’d better get going,” Sara mimicked Grissom’s words and giggled. Warrick grinned. His plan was back on schedule. They walked out of the lab, leaving a confused Grissom and Greg in their wake.<br>
<br>
“What was that?” Greg asked, dumbfounded. Grissom shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Got me.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Nick and Catherine were on their way to Chris Edwards’s apartment. He had been pestering her for information since they got in the vehicle, but she didn’t say anything until they were half way there. He looked over at her from the driver’s seat when they were at a red light and gave her his best puppy dog eyes. She laughed and threw her hands in the air in mock surrender.<br>
<br>
“Fine! I’ll tell you. What do you want to know?” Nick grinned and continued driving.<br>
<br>
“What do you know about Warrick and Sara?” She shook her head.<br>
<br>
“You can’t tell Grissom or Sara,” she started. He peered at her through the corner of his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Sara? Wouldn’t she already know what’s going on?”<br>
<br>
“Uh, no, not exactly.” Nick was intrigued. He shot her a pressing look. “Warrick asked Sara out as a friend thing, that part is true.” He nodded. “But, he also did it because he thought it might make Grissom hop off the fence as far as asking Sara out.” Nick’s eyes grew wide.<br>
<br>
“What?” Nick asked in astonishment. Catherine smiled and shrugged.<br>
<br>
“I guess he got sick of them flirting all the time but not doing anything about it,” she reasoned. Nick pulled over in front of Edwards’s apartment building.<br>
<br>
“When were they flirting? And, oh…” Nick paused, remembering what Sara had let slip the previous day.<br>
<br>
“Oh?” Nick smiled and turned to face Catherine.<br>
<br>
“Sara and I were talking in the car the other day, there was a misunderstanding, she thought I was saying that she was interested in Grissom and flipped out when I said I’d have to tell him that,” Nick rambled. Catherine’s smile grew bigger.<br>
<br>
“Really?” Catherine asked. “Interesting.” Nick shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but don’t you think he’s a little old for her?” Catherine shot him a warning look. “Okay, okay, to each his own, I get it. Ya’ ready?” He motioned toward the apartment building and they gathered their supplies.<br>
<br>
“You remember to call for backup?”<br>
<br>
“Of course,” Nick answered as they made their way into the building. “We’ll just have to wait to go in until they get here.” Catherine nodded and pushed the elevator button.<br>
<br>
“Third floor right?” Nick raised his eyebrows in affirmation. After they got off the elevator, they saw two police officers waiting in the hallway by one of the apartments. Nick did a quick head nod toward them.<br>
<br>
“Hey! How’d you guys get up here before us?” He asked as they made their way down the hall. “I didn’t see your car parked out front.” One of the officers grinned.<br>
<br>
“Parked on the back side of the building, easier access to Owens,” the officer replied.<br>
<br>
“Ah. Well, shall we?” Nick questioned. They agreed and rang the small buzzer on the door. A few thundering footsteps vibrated as the man came to answer his door. Catherine and Nick exchanged a silent look, and Catherine ran her fingers over the gun in her holster. Chris Edwards was not a man who was small, or even average, in size or stature. Nick looked up at the goliath standing in front of them. He was at least 6’6” and looked like he had worked out every day of his life. Instead of a normal greeting, he simply let a small growl out. Catherine decided that she’d better be the one to speak or a fight could break out.<br>
<br>
“Mr. Edwards? I’m Catherine Willows with the Las Vegas Crime Lab, we have a warrant to search your apartment,” she said simply, and she thought, authoritatively, as she handed him the warrant. He scowled at her, and didn’t move out of the doorway. Instead he bore his eyes into her. Catherine, despite being able to stand up for herself in most situations, felt very intimidated by the man, and motioned to her gun with her hand again. His eyes peeled away from her and he stepped back into the apartment, leaving the door open for them to come inside. Nick noticed some pictures on the wall of Edwards’ in a wrestling outfit, and, as usual, tried to strike up a conversation to see if he could get additional information.<br>
<br>
“You used to be a wrestler?” He managed what could pass for a social smile at the man. Edwards glared back at him.<br>
<br>
“Used to be,” he answered. His low, gravely voice, only added to the aura of creepy danger that surrounded him. Nick nodded and turned away from him, deciding that it would be safer to try and collect evidence. He had a feeling that the sooner they got out of there, the better.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Sara and Warrick waited on the stoop outside of Ecklie’s house, waiting for Brass to arrive with the warrant.<br>
<br>
“You’re in a good mood,” Warrick observed. “Wouldn’t have anything to do with Grissom paying attention to you again would it?” He grinned and she grinned back.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know where you’re getting that Warrick,” her grin turned into a smile. “I’m just in a good mood. Don’t you ever get good moods?” He raised his eyebrows.<br>
<br>
“Sure, but mine don’t revolve around Grissom,” he kidded. Sara rolled her eyes, and then noticed Brass getting out of his car.<br>
<br>
“Took you long enough Brass,” she called out to him. He smiled as he jogged up to them.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, sorry about that,” he said when he finally reached them. “When you first called and said you needed a warrant for Ecklie’s house because you found his DNA at the murder scene, I thought I was just having a good dream.” He smiled again. Sara nodded.<br>
<br>
They rang the doorbell. There was no answer. They waited another minute and then rang it again. This time, they heard a voice cursing on the inside of the house, telling them to hold on. Ecklie opened the door. He shot a virulent look at Brass and held out his hand.<br>
<br>
“Warrant?” He asked. Brass obliged and handed him the warrant as Warrick shoved past him. He wanted as little to do with the man as possible, especially after seeing the way he had treated Sara the other day. He made a mental note to not leave Sara in the same room with Ecklie without Brass or himself being there too. Ecklie leered at Sara as she walked into the house.<br>
<br>
“If you wanted to get inside my house Sidle, you could have just said so the other day,” he sneered. Sara had to fight the wave of repulsion that coursed through her body with his statement, and just ignored him, going to the other room. Ecklie smirked. It was so easy to get a reaction from her, even if she didn’t use words. Warrick had heard the comment and shot Ecklie a warning look, to which, Ecklie responded by rolling his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Calm down sport, I didn’t touch your girlfriend,” he said, ignoring any response that Warrick may have given, he went to the position he had been in before they had rung the bell, sitting in his reclining chair watching television. Warrick was starting to fume, but he shook it off. If they did find any evidence that implicated Ecklie in Thomason’s murder, then he would be out of their lives for a long time. He smiled at this thought. Brass came over to Warrick as he was looking through cabinets in the front room.<br>
<br>
“Your girlfriend?” He asked, in a hushed tone, just in case he had heard Ecklie incorrectly. Warrick stared up at him from his crouching position on the floor. He gave a little grin.<br>
<br>
“Kind of a long story,” he answered, and then went back to going through the cabinet drawers. Brass raised his eyebrows in surprise, and then decided to check on Sara. He found her in Ecklie’s bedroom.<br>
<br>
“Last place you ever thought you’d be huh?” He asked, although it was more of a statement in response to the evident disgust on her face. She smiled at him.<br>
<br>
“Tell me about it,” she answered, as she sifted through his hamper. She was wearing clear plastic glasses and latex gloves, spraying generous amounts of luminol on every item of clothing. “Can you hit the lights?” He nodded and switched the lights off. It was dark, but he could see her smile as she picked up a pair of pants from the pile that were glowing. He flipped the light switch back on.<br>
<br>
“Find what you were looking for?” She looked over at him with her gap- toothed smile, and proudly held the pair of pants up. They didn’t have any visible blood on them, so Sara reasoned that he had probably tried to clean them. He grinned back at her. “You want me to get Warrick?” She pushed the pants into a large evidence bag.<br>
<br>
“Nope, I’ll do it. Thanks though.” She smiled again as she passed by him and went toward the living room. He grinned to himself. ‘Kind of an odd couple, but she sure seems to be happier than usual, so it must be working.’<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Edwards was a less than gracious host. Not that anyone who was having their house searched for evidence linking them to a murder would be gracious, but some people would stay out of the way. Not Chris Edwards. After the first ten minutes, he started hulking around Catherine. Nick and the two officers had him back off more than once. Nick was digging through the closet when he found a pair of sneakers buried under several other pairs, but the pair he found had blood on the bottoms of them. He smiled. There hadn’t been anything else in the apartment to suggest that Edwards had anything to do with the murder, but he didn’t want to get rid of his $200 Nikes. He bagged them and walked out to the small bathroom, where Catherine was still dusting and swabbing.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” he said, the cheer evident in his greeting. Catherine whipped her head around to see Nick holding up the bag with the shoes in it. She smiled. Edwards got angry.<br>
<br>
“Those are mine,” he stated in an even voice that was tinged with anger ready to explode.<br>
<br>
“Sir, the warrant we gave you gives us the ability to search your home and take any evidence we find with us,” Nick explained in a cool voice, attempting to calm Edwards down. Edwards glared at Nick, and then reached to his side. He grabbed Catherine by her neck. The officers jumped to attention, aimed their guns, and told him to let her go. Both Nick and Catherine looked panicked. Nick had been in situations before where he had been the one who was threatened or harmed, but to have to watch it happen to one of his friends was a different story. “Let her go!” Edwards shook his head.<br>
<br>
“You take something of mine, I take something of yours,” Edwards said in a collected voice. Then he slammed Catherine’s head onto the ceramic sink. Blood splattered and she was unconscious. The two officers responded immediately by shooting him. They had to shoot him several times before he finally went down. Nick crouched down by Catherine’s body and yelled at the officers.<br>
<br>
“Call an ambulance!” The officers looked at each other. “Now!”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Sara and Warrick had already made it back to the lab when Sara’s cell phone rang.<br>
<br>
“Sidle.” Sara listened to Nick recall the entire incident to her. Throughout the conversation, Warrick watched Sara’s bubbly exterior fall to fearful and sullen. “Did you tell Grissom yet? Okay, Warrick and I will be right there.” She pressed the button to end the call.<br>
<br>
“What’s going on?” Warrick asked, following an already moving Sara down the hallway. He noticed that she was upset and that her hands had started to shake. He placed a hand on her shoulder to stop her. “Sara?” She turned to face his direction, but refused to meet his eyes.<br>
<br>
“The case Nick and Catherine were on…” she paused. “The suspect got angry, they couldn’t stop him in time…” Warrick’s expression dropped as he paid close attention to what Sara was going to say next. She finally looked in his eyes. “Catherine’s hurt, she’s in the hospital, it’s not good. Can we go now?” She asked in desperation. Warrick was in shock, and all he could do was nod, following Sara out to the car.<br>
<br>
Sara saw Nick pacing in the waiting area. She went over to him and gave him a big hug.<br>
<br>
“Have you heard anything yet?” Nick shook his head. Sara noticed that Warrick looked panicked. She walked over to him and placed a reassuring hand on his arm. “She’s going to be okay.” The statement came out sounding more unsure than Sara would have liked. He closed his eyes and sighed. Acting on emotion alone, he wrapped his arms around her. She rested her head on his chest; still holding back the tears she knew would come eventually. She and Catherine weren’t best friends, but she had been getting along better with her. Now she was silently thinking that she might not ever get the chance to really get to know her. For Sara, working with death had dulled the fact that life is a fragile thing, when for most people it would have done the opposite.<br>
<br>
Grissom came down the opposite end of the hallway, after questioning the nurse endlessly about Catherine’s condition. Nick was the first to call out to him. Grissom acknowledged him with a raise of his eyebrows, and then directed his attention toward Warrick, who was still holding Sara in his arms.<br>
<br>
“Anything yet?” Warrick asked hopefully. Grissom stared at him blankly, a gesture that the others misinterpreted as shock at Catherine’s situation. “Gris?” Grissom raised his eyes a little in response to hearing his name, and then shook his head.<br>
<br>
“The nurse said her vitals were strong, but she’s still unconscious. She’ll send the doctor over when she gets out.” Sara smiled a dull smile.<br>
<br>
“A woman doctor, Catherine will be glad,” she said approvingly. Warrick grinned. They still had one arm around each other, and he leaned down to give her a chaste kiss on the top of her head. Grissom frowned, and went to sit down on a chair in the waiting area. Nick and the others followed. Nick watched the interaction between Sara and Warrick as they sat next to each other. They were both impatiently flipping through the old magazines that were lying out, and then handing them off to the other person.<br>
<br>
He silently wondered to himself if Warrick’s plan hadn’t backfired on him, with the two falling for each other. He was sure that that their comfort ability with being around each other wasn’t faked, and that neither one of them was cruel enough to intentionally put more misery on Grissom, with one of his best friends already lying in a hospital bed. His thoughts, and everyone else’s, were put on hold when the doctor came over.<br>
<br>
“Hi, I’m Dr. Bettis, are you Ms. Willows’s friends?” They nodded and Grissom shook her hand.<br>
<br>
“How is she doing?” He asked, bracing himself for the worst.<br>
<br>
“Her skull was fractured in three spots. The first two were small fractures, but the third could cause lasting damage. I expect it to heal on its own, but she may need plastic surgery to correct it.” She paused, waiting for them to digest the information. “We were able to control the bleeding, and when she wakes up, she’ll most likely have a bad concussion and some possible memory loss,” she explained.<br>
<br>
“But she’ll be okay?” Nick asked nervously. Dr. Bettis gave a compensory grin and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Barring any further complications, I expect her to make a full recovery eventually. But,” she was quick to add, “she won’t be able to go back to work for a while, and she’ll need a strong support system to help take care of her for a couple of weeks.” Sara nodded and lightly elbowed Warrick in the ribs.<br>
<br>
“It’s covered,” she answered. Warrick eyed her, and then ran a hand over his face.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, no problem,” he said. Dr. Bettis gave a quick nod. Grissom observed the interaction. He knew that Sara and Catherine weren’t close, but he was happy to see her making an effort to be there for her.<br>
<br>
“They’re moving her out of the E.R. to a regular room now, you should be able to see her after that.” She looked at her watch. “I’d give it a half hour.” They agreed and Dr. Bettis left. Sara got fidgety after they sat down again.<br>
<br>
“Problem Sara?” Grissom asked, staring her down. She bounced out of her chair, still fidgeting with her hands.<br>
<br>
“I can’t just sit here Grissom, I feel useless,” Sara explained. As much as he didn’t want to see her go, Grissom conceded.<br>
<br>
“They won’t let you use your cell phone in here.” Sara shot him a ‘duh’ look. “Why don’t you go out side and call Greg? See if he’s come up with anything on the evidence you and Warrick brought back from Ecklie’s place?” Sara sighed in relief.<br>
<br>
“On it,” she said, as she quickly made her way to the exit. Grissom let his head fall. Warrick tried to be reassuring.<br>
<br>
“She’ll be okay, Catherine’s a fighter.” Grissom’s eyes darted up to Warrick’s. He saw concern, empathy, and maybe a little fear, although he doubted Warrick would ever admit that. Grissom took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes and the bridge of his nose with one hand. He said nothing to Warrick in response, he didn’t need to.<br>

Sara flipped out her cell phone the second she got outside, and hurriedly called Greg.<br>
<br>
“Lab, this is Greg,” he answered, still looking at the computer.<br>
<br>
“Hey Greg, it’s Sara. You got anything on those pants yet?” She looked around. Despite being outside, she was still a little jumpy.<br>
<br>
“You know how long it takes to match up blood results? How much other work I’ve had dumped on me from day shift?” He rambled, twirling a pencil in his fingers.<br>
<br>
“God, Greg, do you have anything yet or not?!” Sara quipped, then wiped her arm over her forehead, brushing her hair out of her face. “Sorry, it’s been a bad day,” she apologized. Greg seemed more taken aback by the apology than the snipe.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I know,” he remarked in a quieter voice. “Prelim results match your vic, but that’s just typing, not DNA,” he explained. Sara nodded to herself.<br>
<br>
“Anything else?”<br>
<br>
“Well, if Nick’s there with you, which I presume he is, tell him the blood on the shoes came back with mixed results.” Sara furrowed her brow in a quizzical manner.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
<br>
“Looks like the shoes have two different kinds of blood on them, one of the types matches the victim in that case, the other doesn’t. You want the weird part?” He paused and she sighed in frustration. “Fine. The second blood type doesn’t match either suspect. In fact, it looks like there was a first layer on there and then a second. Creepy. If nothing else, you’d think this guy would rinse off the bottom of his expensive shoes.” Sara shook her head.<br>
<br>
“I guess.” She didn’t really feel like putting up with Greg’s eccentricities. “Thanks Greg, I’ll tell Nick.” She hung up on him. She took in a deep breath and started to turn around when she saw Jimmy Estes to the side of her, only she saw him too late. He covered her mouth and nose with a chloroform-covered cloth, and then caught her unconscious body. Her cell phone dropped to the ground. He carried her to a waiting car, shoving her in the back. He got in the passenger seat and nodded to the driver.<br>
<br>
“Let’s go.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Grissom kept looking at the door Sara had gone through as he paced back and forth. Nick grinned.<br>
<br>
“It’s a good thing the floor is tiled, if they had carpet you’d have worn a hole in it by now,” he said lightheartedly. Grissom gave him a serious look.<br>
<br>
“She should have been back by now,” he stated. Nick shrugged.<br>
<br>
“You’re the one who told her to get out of here,” he received another warning glare. “Okay, maybe she just went to get coffee somewhere good. The stuff here is terrible.” He winced at the cup in his hands and put it down. Grissom sighed and his demeanor loosened a little.<br>
<br>
“If you’re want her to come back in, why don’t you just go tell her?” Warrick asked, not looking up from the magazine he was skimming through. Grissom shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I want to be here when they come to tell us what room Catherine’s in.” Warrick nodded.<br>
<br>
“You could call her,” he said. Grissom stared dully at him and Warrick raised his eyes. He motioned to the courtesy phone with his head. Grissom gave a small grin in thanks and walked over to the phone, dialing Sara’s cell phone number. He listened impatiently as it kept ringing with no answer. He furrowed his brow. He knew she had it with her, why wasn’t she answering? Finally, a voice picked up, but it wasn’t Sara’s.<br>
<br>
“Hello?” The crease in Grissom’s brow deepened, in anger and in worry.<br>
<br>
“Who is this?” He demanded.<br>
<br>
“Calm down dude,” the male voice said on the other end. Grissom was too impatient to roll his eyes. “I just found this phone on the ground outside the hospital. I don’t know where the owner is.” Grissom’s features dropped.<br>
<br>
“What?” He wanted to make sure he had heard correctly, and that his mind wasn’t playing tricks on him. With everything that had happened over the last few days, his head was already starting to spin from sleep deprivation and trying to solve too many puzzles at once.<br>
<br>
“The owner of the cell phone isn’t here man,” the boy said. “I’m going to turn it into lost and found, so I’m going to hang up on you now okay?” He said in a condescending voice, as if trying to calm Grissom on the other end. Grissom hung up the courtesy phone.<br>
<br>
“Sara’s gone,” he gazed in Nick and Warrick’s direction, but not at either one of them. “Someone found her cell phone out front.” The manner of his speech was eerily calm. He was trying to figure out what was going on. He knew that Sara had been shaken by Catherine’s situation, but she would never just up and leave like that. Even if Greg had found something amazing in the results, she would have come in and told him that she was leaving, and if not him then Warrick. He inwardly cringed that he had even thought that.<br>
<br>
Nick and Warrick, however, became very worried compared to Grissom’s deceivingly calm exterior.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean she’s gone?” Warrick asked, standing up. “She wouldn’t take off. She and Catherine aren’t best friends, but she was just as worried about her as we are.” Nick nodded and crossed his arms.<br>
<br>
“I don’t see her doing something like that either,” he added. “But who would take Sara?” Warrick shot a pointed look at him.<br>
<br>
“You think somebody took her?” Nick shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Well, we all agree that she wouldn’t just leave, right? And I know she wouldn’t leave without her cell phone, she’s practically surgically attached to that thing.” Grissom and Warrick exchanged worried glances, and then Grissom’s turned to panick.<br>
<br>
“Where is Ecklie?” Nick and Warrick looked at each other.<br>
<br>
“Dunno. Home?” Warrick answered. Grissom stared unbelievingly at him. “I don’t follow the man around Gris, and charges haven’t been brought against him.” Grissom closed his eyes for a moment.<br>
<br>
“He took her.” Nick raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Why would Ecklie take Sara?” Warrick sighed and shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Long story man, long story,” he answered. Grissom made his way to the courtesy phone again and called Brass.<br>
<br>
“I had him put out an APB on Sara,” he flopped into the unwelcoming chair. “I shouldn’t have let this happen,” Grissom stated, the burden of the situation weighing heavily on him.<br>
<br>
“It wasn’t your fault Gris,” Warrick said reassuringly and placed a hand on Grissom’s shoulder for a second. He hung his head down. “If anyone’s to blame it’s me. I should have gone outside with her. She was upset, she probably wasn’t paying attention to her surroundings. It’s the Holly and Nick thing all over again, I shouldn’t have let her go out alone,” he replied solemnly, his voice full of self blame. Warrick ran his hands over his face and then crossed his arms. Grissom took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes again.<br>
<br>
“It’s not your fault Warrick,” he said, thinking that he wished it were, so he could have someone to blame but himself. “I’m the one who told her to go outside and call Greg.” His eyes regained a little sparkle. “Nick, call Greg and find out what he told Sara.” Nick went to the phone in the lobby. “Warrick, try to think of any place that Ecklie might take Sara. If it was him, then it may have something to do with the case you were working on.” Warrick raised his eyebrows, but decided not to comment, rather to just go along with Grissom’s effort to regain control over the situation. A hospital volunteer approached the men, as they were busy with their different chores.<br>
<br>
“Hi. You’re waiting to see,” he paused, “Catherine Willows?” Grissom nodded, and the man continued. “Okay, she’s in room 403. Do you need instructions on how to get there?”<br>
<br>
“No,” Grissom answered rather gruffly. “We’ll just follow the signs, thanks.” The man plastered a fake smile onto his face.<br>
<br>
“Okay, but if you change your mind, anyone at the nurses’ stations can help you,” he said, turning around to walk the other way, he rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Catherine lay still in her hospital bed, tubes running fluids into her veins. Nick sat down next to her and held her hand, apologizing over and over again. Grissom sat down as well, but Warrick seemed put on edge by seeing Catherine in that position.<br>
<br>
“Warrick?” Grissom asked, then motioning with his eyes for Warrick to sit down. Warrick raised his eyebrows and shot Grissom a skeptical look, then glanced at Catherine.<br>
<br>
“It shouldn’t have happened,” he said, almost under his breath. Nick looked up at him, thinking that Warrick was placing the blame on him for the incident.<br>
<br>
“There wasn’t anything I could do. She’s gonna be fine though, you heard the doc.” Warrick sighed.<br>
<br>
“I wasn’t talking about Catherine, well, I was, but I meant the whole thing,” he rambled. Grissom narrowed his eyes.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean Warrick?”<br>
<br>
“It just feels like these last few days, it seems like we’ve been set up somehow, like somebody is pulling the strings.” He sat down.<br>
<br>
“Explain.” Grissom could only take so much, and Warrick’s rambling wasn’t helping his oncoming headache.<br>
<br>
“Doesn’t it seem interesting to you that Ecklie was involved in the Thomason murder? And then he was hitting on Sara and she shot him down and now she’s missing?” Grissom and Nick exchanged glances.<br>
<br>
“You think this has all been some big conspiracy of some kind?” Grissom asked in a tone that was disbelief mixed with amusement at Warrick’s hypothesis. Warrick stared back at him, and after a brief pause, he got up again.<br>
<br>
“What the hell was she thinking liking you?” Warrick mumbled. Grissom furrowed his brow in confusion. Warrick made his way over to Catherine’s bedside and leaned down to give her a kiss on the forehead. “Get well soon pretty.” Then he started to leave.<br>
<br>
“Where are you going?” Nick asked.<br>
<br>
“To get Sara back,” he replied in a determined voice. Grissom got up to follow him. He caught him in the hall and grabbed his arm. He looked down, as if he didn’t know what to say to Warrick. “Something wrong?” Grissom looked up at him.<br>
<br>
“Everything,” he sighed. Warrick’s expression held compassion for his friend.<br>
<br>
“Gris, you know I care about Catherine,” he started, and Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
“You’re good friends. It really seems like she’s taken you under her wing.” Warrick inwardly winced, but only because it was true. There was only so much he could do to make her notice him, really notice him, and so far she hadn’t. She had seen all of his gestures as friendship, or maybe as mentor/student, but had never indicated that she returned his feelings.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but there’s nothing I can do for her, she’s already getting good care from the hospital staff, and you and Nick are here to talk to her,” he paused, carefully wording what would come next. “But Sara is out there somewhere, with Ecklie or not, she’s missing. She needs me.” Grissom felt his heart drop, but decided to finally make effort.<br>
<br>
“No, she doesn’t Warrick,” he said, ignoring Warrick’s narrowed eyes. “She needs me.” Warrick just stared blankly at him for a moment, caught off guard by Grissom’s statement, and then a small grin crept onto his face.<br>
<br>
“Well, glad you finally realized it.” Confusion swept over Grissom’s features.<br>
<br>

It smelled familiar, but she couldn’t place the scent. She tried to get up to search for a light switch, only to find that her arms and legs were restrained. ‘Geez, they must have really doped me up for me not to notice that I’m tied to a chair.’ She struggled a bit, trying to work her way out of the ropes and duct tape, but only ended up tipping the chair to the side, causing a noise loud enough to alert her captors. ‘@#%$.’ The door opened and the lights flicked on. A guffaw resonated through the room.<br>
<br>
“Way to go Sidle.” Sara turned and lifted her head as much as possible to see the man, but she didn’t need to, having recognized the voice.<br>
<br>
“Ecklie! You son of a bitch! Let me out of here!” Sara let her emotions get the best of her temporarily, but quickly switched tactics. “You might get less time if you voluntarily release me.” Ecklie laughed.<br>
<br>
“I’m not going to be serving any time Ms. Sidle, nice try at the whole negotiating thing though,” he mocked. He walked closer to her and looked down at her, and she looked angrily back at him. She glanced around at what little she could see of the room.<br>
<br>
“The least you could do is push me back up,” she said, trying her best to keep her voice calm. From what she had seen, it didn’t look or smell like Ecklie’s house, and she wanted to know where she was, reasoning that it might help her chances at escaping. Ecklie raised an eyebrow, but then shrugged, pushing her back up. He was standing much too close to her for comfort. Of course, if Sara had a choice, he wouldn’t be on the same continent as she was. Sara got a better look around and furrowed her eyebrows.<br>
<br>
“This isn’t your house,” she stated, a confused tone to her voice. A creepy smirk swept across Ecklie’s face.<br>
<br>
“No, it’s your boyfriend’s place,” he responded. Letting out a chuckle, he said, “Guess you two usually go to a motel or your place since you didn’t recognize his bedroom right off.” He kept grinning. “Or do you not usually make it that far?” Ecklie leaned in and Sara turned her face away from him, repulsed and angry. “Oh yeah,” he ran a finger along her cheek and she snapped her head away from him. “I could easily see you being a kink.” He smiled and pulled back a little.<br>
<br>
Sara fought the urge to spit at him, knowing that repercussions would immediately follow. The longer she could keep him talking, the longer she could postpone anything else that he might have in mind. She inwardly grimaced at the thought.<br>
<br>
“So tell me Sara,” he drew out her name and she glared at him. “What made you decide to go out with Warrick Brown?” He said Warrick’s name in disgust.<br>
<br>
“What made you decide to kill an innocent woman, frame your accomplice, and then kidnap me?” She shot back, although still in a normal volume. It had turned into an obvious power struggle, and although Ecklie clearly had the physical advantage, Sara would be damned if she’d let him have the intellectual one. The least she could do was find out why all of this had happened, so she could have some resolution before Ecklie killed her. Ecklie smiled an evil, lecherous smile, and Sara did everything in her power not to wince. He leaned again.<br>
<br>
“Only one innocent woman? Tsk, tsk. Your investigative skills are slipping Sidle. Guess working and sleeping with Brown have clouded your mind a little, huh?” He chuckled and walked over to another chair that was facing her, one that looked considerably more comfortable than the one Sara was tied to. He sat down and leered at her. “Such a waste.” She narrowed her eyes. Two could play this game.<br>
<br>
“Well, since you think I’m so incompetent and you’re going to kill me anyway,” she paused and Ecklie smiled. “Why don’t you tell me what’s actually going on?” He put his hands together, pondering the request. He put on a serious face and leaned forward.<br>
<br>
“Haven’t you ever wondered Sidle? I know you have.” He arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Wondered what?” Ecklie’s demeanor didn’t change. He kept staring at her with his cold eyes.<br>
<br>
“What it’s like on the other side,” he started to explain. “Every person has the capability for good or evil. Haven’t you ever wondered, after working all these cases, being around all these dead bodies, getting into all these killers’ heads? Haven’t you ever wondered what it would be like?” Sara’s face paled. When she first learned that Ecklie might be involved, she thought he might be trying to advance his career somehow, or it had been a lovers’ quarrel gone wrong, she hadn’t imagined that he had turned into a sociopath. The evidence that had just been presented to her made her skin crawl and set every nerve in her body on edge. She barely managed to shake her head.<br>
<br>
“No. I’ve never wondered what it’s like to kill someone,” she stated, the fear apparent in her voice. Ecklie grinned slightly and leaned back in his chair.<br>
<br>
“That’s a shame. It’s kind of a rush. Knowing that you can take another life, and take care of the crime scene so it looks like it was someone else. It’s an intense sensation,” he said in all seriousness. Sara felt nauseous and panicked. She surmised that he probably brought her to Warrick’s place so he could plant evidence to make it look like Warrick had been the one to kill her. She knew for sure now that he would kill her, and probably do unspeakable things to her beforehand. Her only hope was that Grissom and the others had noticed her disappearance and were looking for her, and that they would find her in time.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Grissom and Warrick were driving toward Ecklie’s house to meet up with Brass, who already had units searching the city for Ecklie and Sara. Warrick’s phone rang.<br>
<br>
“Warrick.”<br>
<br>
“Hey, is Grissom there with you? I heard about what’s going on. I tried to call him, but his phone is giving an out of area or power off signal. Have you found her?” Greg rambled. Warrick turned to Grissom.<br>
<br>
“Hey Gris, turn your phone back on.” Grissom frowned and got his cell phone out. He had forgotten to turn it back on after they left the hospital.<br>
<br>
“Crap! How could I be so stupid? She could have been trying to call me.” Warrick shook his head.<br>
<br>
“She would have tried to call me next, and Greg’s the only one who’s called.” He heard a sigh come from the other end of the phone.<br>
<br>
“Speaking of which, I’m still here,” Greg said in an annoyed tone.<br>
<br>
“Sorry. Anything new?” Warrick asked. Greg smiled.<br>
<br>
“As a matter of fact, yes, and thank you for asking. You know how the second set of blood on Edwards’s shoes?”<br>
<br>
“No,” Warrick said in confusion.<br>
<br>
“Oh, I guess Sara didn’t get a chance to tell you,” Greg said regretfully. “Anyway, there was a second set of blood on Chris Edwards’s shoes, and you’ll never guess who it belongs to.”<br>
<br>
“Who?” Warrick squirmed a little in the passenger’s seat. He was growing impatient and they were almost at Ecklie’s house.<br>
<br>
“Your vic, Thomason,” he stated in a proud voice. Warrick’s eyebrows raised.<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“Oh wait, it gets better,” Greg said, clearly excited by the information. “It also had a third set of DNA mixed in with the muck, but I did the analysis and it’s semen, not blood.”<br>
<br>
“But she didn’t have any semen found in or around her body,” Warrick said.<br>
<br>
“Well, what do I know? Maybe he stepped on the trash with the condom in it or something,” Greg hypothesized. “Anyway, get this, it wasn’t Edwards’s or Estes’s semen. It was Ecklie’s.” Warrick’s stomach fell.<br>
<br>
“Are you sure?” He asked, concerned.<br>
<br>
“99.78% match, probably would have been better if it wasn’t mixed in with the two blood samples,” Greg responded. “What’s wrong? I thought this new piece of information would be good news.” Warrick sighed and looked over at Grissom.<br>
<br>
“It is and it isn’t. We think Ecklie’s the one behind Sara’s abduction.”<br>
<br>
“I thought they said Jimmy Estes was the one who showed up on the hospital’s videotape?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, but we think Estes is only hired help, that Ecklie’s the one behind it, and with this new information,” Warrick paused and shook his head, processing what was going on. It had been a long road, but he felt that Sara and he were finally starting to be friends. ‘Maybe even more than friends eventually if Grissom wasn’t in the picture.’ He sighed again. “Greg, I’ve got to go, we’re at Ecklie’s place.” He turned off the phone without waiting for Greg’s reply. Greg sat in the lab, his face buried in his hands, trying to keep from crying.<br>
<br>
Grissom and Warrick met with Brass by the front of the house.<br>
<br>
“There’s no one here,” Brass said with regret. “Anywhere else he could have taken her?” Grissom frowned.<br>
<br>
“We already checked her place,” Grissom answered.<br>
<br>
“And units are going to every seedy motel in the city, just in case,” Brass added. Everyone was worried, time was running out and they still had nothing.<br>
<br>
“Too bad they left Sara’s phone behind,” Warrick mumbled, but Grissom heard him.<br>
<br>
“Why?” Warrick shrugged.<br>
<br>
“It would have been a long shot anyway I guess. I’ve been working on a new triangulator program on my computer at home, it can tell where someone’s cell phone is, and therefore, probably that person, with just the number, they don’t need to make a call.” Grissom’s eyes grew wide. “I already asked Sara if I could try it out with her phone, her number’s already in the system, but I haven’t gotten a chance to test it yet.” Grissom stared at him blankly.<br>
<br>
“We have Ecklie’s cell phone number.” Grissom tilted his head. Warrick grinned and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Let’s go.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Sara sat in the chair, still trying to loosen her restraints, while Ecklie sharpened a long knife. He looked over at her.<br>
<br>
“This should be fun. It always is when they put up a fight.” He grinned an evil grin. Sara tried to ignore him, but it was growing harder.<br>
<br>
“It would be more of a fight if I wasn’t tied up,” she said, knowing that he would never agree to it. He smiled.<br>
<br>
“Maybe after we christen Warrick’s bed,” his eyes grazed over her body and she paled again. ‘They’ll find me, they’ll find me.’ Ecklie shook his head a little as if reading her thoughts. “They’ll find you sweetheart, just not before we have some fun, and not alive,” he sneered. Sara started shaking slightly, but she managed to calm it down to the point where Ecklie didn’t appear to notice.<br>
<br>
“They’ll know you were responsible, you’re going to prison,” Sara stated, getting her nerve up again. “We already have evidence that you were involved in Thomason’s murder, even if they can’t prove the others.” ‘Even if they can’t prove this one,’ she thought ruefully. Ecklie just nodded, which wasn’t the response she was expecting.<br>
<br>
“One last hurrah then,” he said, coming closer to her with the sharpened knife. He didn’t hear the key turning in the front door lock, but he did hear Warrick and Grissom when they came in.<br>
<br>
“It’s in the office,” Warrick said and Grissom nodded, following him quickly down the hall. They may not have even noticed Ecklie and Sara if Ecklie hadn’t reacted. He had one hand over her mouth and the other clutching the knife at her throat.<br>
<br>
“Just in time to watch your girlfriend die,” Ecklie said in a loud voice, commanding the attention of the two men. Warrick and Grissom froze, their eyes large and focused on the scene in front of them. Sara silently begged them with her eyes and Grissom nodded.<br>
<br>
“Put the knife down Ecklie,” Grissom took a few steps forward. “It’s over.” Ecklie rolled his eyes, but his nervousness showed. He began to sweat. “Let her go.” Ecklie was so concentrated on Grissom that Warrick had been able to make his way back into the living room to call Brass. He hoped they would get there in time. Ecklie suddenly noted Warrick’s disappearance.<br>
<br>
“Looks like your boyfriend chickened out Sidle,” he laughed, a nervous, crackly laugh. Grissom shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Warrick isn’t her boyfriend Ecklie.” Ecklie grinned his evil grin.<br>
<br>
“Wow, so the all mighty Grissom doesn’t know everything. Interesting.” Grissom took another step forward, but stopped moving when Ecklie pulled the knife closer to Sara’s neck, drawing a little blood from the first few layers of skin.<br>
<br>
“You think Warrick is her boyfriend because he told you she was taken,” Grissom paused, stalling for time. “He didn’t say by whom.” Ecklie narrowed his eyes at him. Grissom looked at Sara. She looked back at him with a mixture of confusion and surprise and he gave her a small grin. She understood. He turned his attention back to Ecklie. “Put the knife down.” Ecklie shook his head.<br>
<br>
“No way. She dies today.” Two units pulled up to the house with lights but no sirens. They came charging through the open front door, Brass quickly following them. Warrick motioned to the bedroom, but said nothing, and Brass nodded. “She dies now.” He started to slowly run the blade across Sara’s neck and she whimpered in pain. Three shots rang out, and Ecklie fell to the floor. Grissom ran over to Sara and hugged her. She grinned.<br>
<br>
“Don’t suppose you could untie me so I can go to the hospital?” His expression fell to worry and he looked at the cut on her neck. It was starting to bleed more than he had originally seen. He glanced back up at her and she had passed out.<br>
<br>
“Get an ambulance!” Brass nodded.<br>
<br>
“Already on the way.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Grissom slept in a chair in Sara’s hospital room. She woke up and smiled at him, then winced at the pain it caused in her neck. She ran her fingers over the bandage remembering what had happened.<br>
<br>
“Gris,” she whispered. He didn’t move. “Grissom,” she said a little louder, but not so the nurses outside the room could hear. The room was dark and she could see that it was night. ‘Of course, my body’s set on that schedule now,’ she thought. He stirred a little. “Grissom wake up,” she finally said, as close to her normal speaking volume as possible. His eyes cracked open and he grinned.<br>
<br>
“Sara.”<br>
<br>
“Grissom.” She smiled brightly. He moved his chair so he was right next to her bed. She chuckled. “Geez Grissom, you may as well just sit on the bed,” she said half sarcastically. He cocked an eyebrow at her and she looked the other way to hide the blush that had covered her cheeks. “So how is Catherine?”<br>
<br>
“She’s fine. She woke up, slight concussion, no discernable memory loss. Could have been a lot worse.” Sara nodded. “Warrick’s going to help take care of her until the concussion passes.” Sara smiled.<br>
<br>
“He has a crush on her you know.” He grinned.<br>
<br>
“I thought he liked you,” he admitted in a hushed voice. “It nearly killed me to see him with you like that.” She took his hand and he looked up at her.<br>
<br>
“He knew I was taken.” He nodded, leaned in, and kissed her.<br>
<br>
Change was scary, but good once they got there.<br>
<br>
<br>
