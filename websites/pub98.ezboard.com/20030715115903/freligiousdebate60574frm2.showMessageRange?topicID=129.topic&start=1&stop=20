<br>
&quot;The syllabus for Religious Education requires schools to teach a broadly Christian curriculum and, additionally, certain aspects of Judaism and Hinduism.  Sometimes a &quot;themed&quot; approach to learning is used.  Fore example, the festivals of Hannukkah and Diwali link well with Christian festivals connected with light.&quot;<br>
<br>
So there you go - that is basically how it is done...they have a Christian assembly every morning, for a &quot;collective act of worship&quot;, and everything throughout the school is taught from a Christian perspective, with the addition of learning about different religions (with the emphasis on the fact that they aren't what &quot;we&quot; believe), at different times of the year. <br>

Basically they teach xianity as truth - they all pray together, sing together, etc..and it is assumed that you are xian unless you state otherwise (you have to have a valid religion to pull your children out of these assemblies)...and you are right..they basically throw in titbits from the other two religions to keep people happy.<br>

It sounds like it is a real challenge to raise a non-Christian child in England.  If religion is supposed to be such a positive thing, then why does it make people like us want to bang our heads into the wall with frustration?

This made another thought pop into my head (scary I know).  It almost seems like this promotes segregation.  Here in the US some people decide to send their kids to a private religious school, but at least our public schools can house children of all religious backgrounds.  I know that there is a large Muslim population in Europe in general (not sure about the specifics in the UK), and it seems like the current system would push entire groups of people into their own schools, much like what used to happen in the southeastern US.  I think the US has the potential to do that if we don't keep SOCAS in check.  If our schools become more Christian, then Muslims will be in their own schools, Jews in their own schools, etc.  School vouchers would help enable this to happen as well.  I believe that a major reason racism isn't as prominent in our society is because kids can say &quot;hey, black people aren't so bad, I knew this guy at school...&quot;.  Familiarity helps to produce tolerance, and when people are being segregated like that, then people who are different will seem foreign to the average citizen.  A Muslim will go from the guy you sit next to in school to the nameless and faceless statistic in that building across town.  Okay, I'll quit releasing these brain farts now.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We also had a hindu (I think) who didn't attend as well..<br>
<br>
Basically, if you have a recognised religious belief that differs from mainstream xianity - you are allowed to keep your children out of the assemblies (they go to the book corner and read usually). <br>
<br>
We have a lot of Church of England schools which are more religious than the &quot;normal&quot; schools (like the one my children are at)..they do a lot more RE - and we also have private schools where xianity is really pushed (or whatever religion it was set up for...but like I said, I think there is only one muslim school)...<br>
<br>
As distressing as it sounds, my childrens school is actually pretty laid back when it comes to religion - they basically teach the minimum they have to by law (although the headmaster is a fundi, so I think he tends to string out the assemblies more than necessary - when parents attend for whatever reason, if they don't sing loud enough, or all bow their heads in prayer, he makes everyone do it again! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
Anyway..I'm rambling now - but my main reason for posting was to answer Trish's question on JW's.<br>
<br>
Actually, while I think of it, I have a question for Trish about JW's - <br>
<br>
When a child reaches the age of 18 (or is it 16) and are allowed to choose for themselves whether to stay in the religion or not - is it really made an option to leave?  I remember when we were younger, my brothers best friend was JW...when he reached that age, he decided that he didn't want to be JW anymore...his parents were not happy, and said that they would never buy him anything ever again (despite the fact that they didn't do birthdays, this family bought gifts for their children all year round)...he ummed and ahhhed about it for a while, and decided that he would be JW after all....the very next day he woke up and found an electric guitar at the end of his bed!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You can leave but depending on your status as a member you will probably lose your family and friends. JW's are technically not supposed to speak to non-members unless they have to in their day-to-day lives. If you go to a different religion you will probably not have any family or friends that will speak to you. It comes to your own discretion with your family but the majority of JW I know will not speak to the family members that decided to go to a different religion. My whole family doesn’t speak to my dad because he left the JW and went to LDS.<br>

That is just the way it is. They devoutly believe this is what they are supposed to be doing to get the DF person back on track.<br>

Of course, she doesn't like my religion so she makes it out to sound horrible and that is ok, she has had some negative repercussions from her family's involvement with JWs.

A lot of things depend on the family.  I don't agree with the situation that you gave with the gift giving.  I have two daughters from my first marriage and their dad is not a witness.  They go to his house on the holidays just like the divorce papers say, the holidays are split just like in any other divorce. (I was not a witness until after I got divorced.)  My children will be able to decide what they want to do religion wise when they are old enough.  Their dad has every right to take them to church if he wants to when he has them and teach them what he feels is right and when they are at my home they will be taught what I feel is right. No different than if he was catholic or whatever and I was atheist.  In fact, some parents let their kids get baptized when they are 14 or 15 or whatever, but I will be encouraging my kids to wait until they are older like 18 or 19.  My oldest is a people pleaser and I want her to do it(get baptized) for her, and for God, if that is her choice, not for me or her Pops(step-dad).  There is a song that I just love that we sing, it is calles &quot;Make the Truth Your Own&quot; and I think of my kids everytime we sing it.  Also, about the disfellowshipping thing, anyone who is baptized knows going in what happens if you are disfellowshipped.  If anyone knows anyone that is DFed and is mad or upset about it, they knew what would happen.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't know if that even answered your question or not but there you go.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

That's really interesting Trish. Is an unsympathetic &quot;they knew it would happen&quot; approach generally the JW attitude toward the DF'd? It really doesn't allow for the possibility of one having a change of heart, does it? It is normal for people to grow, mature and change. But for JWs, sounds like the consequences of having a change of heart are so brutal that I would think the very spector of DFing would frighten all but the most bold from even the prospect of seriously questioning JW teachings. <br>
<br>
Is there some weakness in the teachings that can't stand up to scrutiny? I can't imagine why else such threat of loss would be needed to keep believers in line.<br>
<br>
I ask because I don't know a lot about JWs but I am applying this to my own experience of Catholic temporary insanity. If Catholics DF'd (or practiced a true excommunication - which they don't really do because church membership = $$$) then my husband and kids would be forbidden to see me?  That's unthinkable.<br>
<br>
When I &quot;went in&quot; I did NOT know I would one day utterly lose my faith. Going in I did not know the future. But if they were threatening to cut me off from my babies, I would have felt pressured to shut down my intellect and pretend to believe.<br>
<br>
How does one choose to submit to a religious authority that would forbid them to see a loved one if either lost faith? Wow. Even prisoners on death row get to see their moms.<br>
<br>
I don't mean you any disrespect Trish. I appreciate your posts. This just struck close to home and I'm having a hard time getting my mind around it.<br>

You’re right out of most of the religions I think yours can be the cruelest. I cannot respect any religion that makes it ok for you to disown your flesh and blood. I do realize that when you decided to get baptized you do know what will happen to you if you don’t follow the rules. If what I said sounds horrible then maybe you should reexamine your choice of religion because I only said the truth.<br>
<br>
The jw religion does not encourage seeking any truth except the one you are being taught. So you must believe with blind faith. I have a lot of people I love that are still JW. My grandfather is an Elder and has been for 30 years. So I am quite familiar with how it all works.<br>
<br>
I do know where you are coming from and why you feel the way you do. I am not trying to say anything bad about you as a person. So I hope you don’t take this personal.<br>

Most people get disfellowshipped for adultery.  I also know a few people that have been disfellowshipped for becoming apostate.  Mostly it has to with breaking Bible principles without any remorse.  I know that an atheist wouldn't think these things very important, but if you try to live your life by the Bible and then just decide to ignore it that is when you are held accountable for your actions.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Just curious to know if they are big things or little things.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <br>
Whether they are big things or little things really depends on how you look at it and what your beliefs are.  If you don't believe in the Bible then they are all little things I am sure.<br>
<br>
Most Christian denomonations don't have anything like this, that is where once saved always saved came from.  We do not believe in OSAS.  Anyway, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>most</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> people are disfellowshipped for adultery.<br>
