I haven't seen it yet, but its nice to hear they are putting some cash back into the fields. That grass will be hard to straighten out as much as they play on it. To do it, they would probably have to shut down a field at a time for a couple of weeks &amp; just focus on getting the bermuda established. That would be a tough task.<br>

I'm not saying that our shortstop was in the right but the other team mouthing and cursing the umpire that would make a sailor blush For three innings if far more worse than what our shortstop ever thought about doing. needless to say I guess he wants the Texas team that comes onece a year to come back and piss on the Oklahoma Team that probably would have  came back several more times in the season!!!!!<br>

Before I get into this my name is Cheyenne (Boog) Graham. I play coed for HMF Softball Club and mens with Team Crisis. Just so you don't think I am hiding behind a computer screen. <br>
<br>
I got to Boomer Sat night and was impressed. They had made vast improvements on the looks of the fields. Even the outfield grass was mowed and evened out some. The tourney was being run great and everything was going smooth. I saw and had several quality umpires who I hadn't seen in a while. I go to Boomer quite often with various teams and think it is okay. But Saturday night I was flat impressed with the complex and the people there. And honestly I was glad because I had been trying to get my HMF teammates up there for a while. (Simply aren't any tournies in our area anymore and if their are maybe two good teams show). So I really wanted this to be a good experience. Because we were talking about going up there a couple a times a month. But they kept telling me it just seems like we never get treated fairly up there or something off the wall always keeps use from advancing in tournies. I told them and told them that occasionally something will happen but overall it is a nice place to play. Well my believe ability went out the window with the help of two umpires. One being the umpire we had and the head umpire. And again I am personally up there a couple times a month and talk and have a good time with the umpires and never have any trouble besides the spur of the moment outburst at a close call and I am the first to make it right first chance I get. In fact I had talked to the head umpire a little earlier and he seemed as he always does to be a nice guy.<br>
<br>
So I was outraged when the whole thing was over. First of all the team we were playing goes off at the umpire on a umpires descretion call at second. The coach gets in his face screaming at him he is wrong, the dugout lets him know real quick with all the 4 letter words in the book what they think of him. The coach calms down and is trying is calmly trying to explain the rule. Meanwhile the guy is called out as loud as he can says that guy is a f--ing idiot. The umpire turns and looks straight at him. (Why was the guy not thrown right them?) Finally one of their teammates forces them out on the field. No &quot;shut up and lets play&quot; or &quot;one more word and your gone&quot; or anything.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile they continue to badger and bad mouth the umpire while in the field. A couple of innings later the same guy going into second the same call. They go off on the umpire again. The coach is screaming(not yelling) in the umpires face that he is F--ing making up rules and he doesn't have a clue. The dugout waits till the coach is done and then goes off. I am telling you my ears are too fragile for some of this stuff. Yet not one warning shut up and play ball or the thing you always hear &quot;one more word and your done&quot;. Honestly I was glad he didn't throw the whole team because I wanted to see if we could beat them. But they had 7 and 7 and their coach knew he could get thrown without it hurting his team.  <br>
<br>
Finally after 5 more minutes of arguing order is restored by someone one their team, not the umpire. They go get the head umpire. The coach argues the call with head ump for a full inning and was not being real polite in the process. You can tell in the head umpires face he is hot. But instead of coming on the field and becoming the second umpire, he stays outside the fence right beside the plate. I actually saw the head umpire shake his head at couple of poor ball and strike calls that were made. But he continued to stand near the plate listening to the other team badger and moan while in the field about the homeplate umpire. As we go out to the field I noticed that the head man is talking to the other umpire. While this was happening I thought the head man who doing a okay job of handling it standing behind his umpire but also listening to the teams arguments. Well I guess I was wrong. (Remember this conversation)<br>
<br>
To this point we hadn't said a word to the umpire, not one. The inning starts and everything goes smooth until it happened. Ground ball to shortstop who is way in, he tags the girl running to third(in my opinon he tagged her too hard) tries to get back to second to tag before stumbling as he throws to first. There was a lot going on but it was obvious that the girl going to third had been tagged. Because you could hear the thud and the girl at first was out by a step. He calls her safe at first. We weren't happy with the call but nothing was said except &quot;are you sure&quot;. Well I notice the girl was standing on third. I yell &quot;hey red this girl here at third is out, right&quot;.  He says in his best third grade girl voice &quot;I saw no tag&quot;. The guy at short says I almost knocked her down, which he did. I yell not scream &quot;so you actually want us to knock a girl down so you can see a tag&quot;. He says(and I quote),  &quot;I have got to see a tag and I didn't see one&quot;. The shortstop says to the other team sorry if we have to hurt one of your girls to get an out (which was very wrong and worth tossing him for but not what he got tossed for). The guy on second yells above all of us &quot;the F-- you will&quot;. Shortstop yells guys in the direction of the the dugout &quot;I'm sorry, i'm sorry but that was freaking(he said this word not the other) horrible call. Red says nothing but your gone shortstop. <br>
<br>
So the best two teams in the tourney playing for 1st, get a game ended in the top of the sixth at 9 in the morning. Score 17-13. After being there all night. The game was a war but neither team were letting up. I really would have liked to see who would have won. <br>
<br>
What is really sad is the other team has just won by forfeit. And even they are saying to the umpire &quot;no, no lets get back on the field and play&quot;. I even had one tell me hey we should get on this other field and play without umpires to see who would win. <br>
<br>
Well I am tired of thinking about it. I just wanted you guys to know that SIS 21 wasn't just mopeing because we didn't win the tourney. <br>
<br>
But the ? I would like the answer to is why after taking all that cussing, much of it personal, does the umpire toss basically our whole team for argueing our first call of the night. I know I would not have taken any of it. I know what I would have said right off the bat and it is what any quality umpire would say. &quot;I have made my call, I have heard all I am going to, do you wish to continue playing?&quot; Had he had the knowledge(balls) to stand up to them I really feel like none of this would have happened and both teams would know who the better team really is. <br>
<br>
The answer to that question in my opinion and I am willing to beat my truck on it. Is that the head umpire had had enough and has some guts. So he simple tells the other umpire to toss the next person who gives you trouble.  And he is so incompetent that he didn't know he meant from the team that was giving them trouble. And the point that needs to be made is, if you are so scared and unconfident about your abilities as a umpire that you are willing to  listen to all that this guy did you have to be willing to take the same from the other team. <br>
<br>
And another question, what is this guy doing umpiring a game which everybody knows is to see who wins the tournament by himself when the head umpire is apparently free.<br>

What Judy just said was the honest truth and I am moping around because we were there all night playing hard ball just to get screwed by a umpire who obviously has his head up his ass!!!!  I really enjoyed playing up there for our first big tourney of the year and I was really looking forward to coming back and playing again!  I realize that umpires have a tough job and I'm usually the one defending them but  This was just plain moronic for a umpire to get called every thing in the book and then to throw out the other team because he said we was taunting the other team what about the other team taunting the umpire????????  All we said was sorry if we hurt one of you just so the umpire will see the tag!!!!!! I'm pissed off and have every right to be and never will we be going back to Boomer!!!!!!

Everytime I have been there you can play certain teams and they are handed everything. I am a person who really doesn't think an ump can lose a game for you. If you play as well as you should a close call shouldn't be a game breaker, but the way things happened to us this past weekend was horrible. The other team was good and the game would have been close. Why, as an ump, would you kick a person out in a close game w/ first place on the line? We didin't get a chance to ask him since he ran away after his call. I think the tournament was good and the complex looked better, but the officiating in lacking. I guess when you are tired and want to get to bed you will make bad judgements.

Some of the officiating was, questionable but what really had me just amazed was the fighting that occured either during or after the games.  I can say alot of it was contributed to it being 3-4 am and some folks were tired and had little patience, but some of it was just downright crazy.  <br>
<br>
     One thing I liked watching though was some of the co-ed games were really good games and very competative.  One thing I watched was a texas team playing a team in Orange if I remember this correctly and the guy from the Texas team didn't slide and ran over the girl catching who had the ball.  As far as I am aware on those kind of plays the runner has to slide or am I incorrect on this?  I could have sworn if they didn't slide it's an out.   Can anyone elaborate and maybe clear that one up for  me?<br>

One of the umps never calls time and when our pitcher pitches the ball he may or may not call anything. Several times he said that it a no pitch due to him calling time.

Now in saying that I would say that we are all voicing our opinions on here and not to the people that need to hear it ,but me and several other teamates attempted to go into the office and complain but they refused to listen to us because they didnt care if the game was played fair they just wanted paid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C0D9D9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> punchinjudy</span><br> <span class=usertitle>I need to register</span><br>   <font color=#8B0000>(6/3/03 2:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=268.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Boomer</span><hr size=1> The saddest part of all of this that their 4 or 5 maybe more reds at Boomer that are very very very good at what they do. They beat a runner to second to make a call and usually have the best angle and so forth. They continue to get a bad wrap for no reason particularly at Boomer. <br>
In fact, I was sitting around at the top fields right before went down to field 5 for our championship game basically. A couple of the games were betweens teams that were 2-4 and 1-5 playing there last game. And low and behold the umpires which I feel are quality reds are umping them. In fact, I metioned it to one red, &quot;why are you calling this game&quot;. He said this is the field I am supposed to be on. And we get this moron for a 6-0 against 6-0 game. <br>
<br>
*******To anyone who was around when this occured I apologize publicly for acting like a idiot and saying many things that your friends and families shouldn't have to hear and that includes all reds except for that one who shall remain nameless.*************<br>

BTW Great tourney Overstacked and the others who we played. It was a good competitive tourney.<br>

plain and simple. If there is a place to voice your opinions it is this board. This is one of the reasons this board was started. To get the word-softball out there. Negative or not. Boomer has been run bass ackwards for quite some time. They say the door is always open. Not the case. We need this board. I know for a fact the Boomer Mgmt. Read this board and keep up with this board. oklahomasoftball.net can be viewed not only in this state or surrounding states, but anywhere on any computer. If Boomer wants postive publicity from this board, then they need to make positive changes. Paint, fences, stands are obvious attempts at improvements. But they still have a loooong way to go. Word of mouth is always the best advertisement. So YES use this board to voice your opinions.... just don't threaten or use profanity, no one wants to hear that.... <br>
