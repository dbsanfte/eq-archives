Some good some bad.<br>
<br>
The general atmosphere at Boomer compared to other parks seems to be one of uptightness and on edgeness.<br>
<br>
I've played, coached and redded at Boomer so I've experienced a little bit from both sides of the fence. <br>
Boomer plays year round and usually has 8 fields going. Just making a guess I would say they have the most teams signed up for leagues and tourneys of any complex in the state and therefore they play more games than anyone else. Having the most teams and games means they have more opportunities for people to complain. Most of these complaints are probably legit. Others are probably bogus. As you all know there are plenty of idiots out there that complain about every little thing, argue every little call that doesn't go they're way and generally cause trouble. Alan and Brian have to endure that crap constantly and I think sometimes they don't effectively distinguish between the two and the legit complainer's arguments fall on deaf ears. <br>
In general I think they could do a better job of listening, distinguishing and resolving their complaints. Especially the resolving aspect.<br>
Their philosophy is that people are there to have a good time and play softball and the Reds and management should make sure that atmosphere is upheld, but sometimes they don't seem to follow that philosophy. For example, as a coach, the second game of our first doubleheader this spring on Thursday it was raining, 40 degrees and the wind was howling out of the North at 30mph and we were the only two teams out there (MuckDawgs). The other umps called their games because of weather. We were basically forced to play under threat of forfeit. That was not fun. One of my players pulled a groin playing in that crap.  I e-mailed Alan about it and got no response. I guess that 500.00+ we spent out there isn't good enough to warrant a response. I'm sure that kind of crap goes on constantly out there. <br>
<br>
As far as the Reds go. They are expected to be perfect and improve as the season goes on. I know it's a cliche' but no one is perfect. Even before I became a Red, any team I coached, one of the first things I got straight to my guys is that we are not going to let a Red decide the outcome of a game. If you hit the ball and play solid defense you win. You make your own luck as far as I'm concerned. Real teams bounce back from a bad call and the bad teams dwell on it and bitch and moan and are so busy barking at umpires the rest of the game that they lose focus. I see teams getting drilled 20-0 and vice versa and still bitch. It's ridiculous. <br>
<br>
 I think Brian Brewster has an excellent knowledge of the game and does a great job of organizing his crew and does his best to make sure they are trained properly. He has a no nonsense cut to the chase type of supervisory style that has its advantages and disadvantages.  I don't know how many guys he has to deal with now but I'd say 40-60. That is probably the most in the state. And of course with that many umpires you have more oppurtunities for bad calls and bad apples he has to sort through.  In criticism of Brian he seems standoffish and unresponsive and brazen at times. I've worked for him for two seasons and although I really couldn't consider myself a great umpire I thought I was making good progress and was getting better as each week went on. A general rule is that if you are playing and you're an umpire you keep your comments to yourself in regard to the Reds. I was at second base taking my position on the outfield side of the bag and Brian makes it to second and ask's me &quot;Are you scared of the ball?&quot; I said &quot;what?&quot; he repeated &quot;are you scared of the ball?&quot; I said &quot;No of course not&quot; he said well &quot;Step up and take an inside position then&quot;  I did and the second baseman said &quot;Wow, he tore you a new one didn't he?&quot; I wouldn't really have minded if the middle infielders didn't hear this exchange between Brian an I, but since they did I kind of took offense to it. I went to Brian after the game and asked him to clarify what exactly I was doing wrong and he proceeded to tell me in a professional manner what I was doing wrong, but the more I thought about it the more I fumed about being dissed by my UIC on the field and made a decision to E-mail Andy Casey. He said that Brian had a good point and I had a good point too. What? Since when is it OK to be D-balled by your UIC on the field?  Maybe Brian was just trying to get rid of me. I don't know because I rarely got any kind of feedback from him. Anyway, needless to say, I no longer Red at Boomer.  <br>
<br>
I don't know anything about their overhead or financial situation so I cannot comment on the facility upkeep. It can't be good judging from the looks of things. But, the economy isn't doing too well either so hopefully when we see light at the end of the tunnel they can make more drastic improvements.<br>
<br>
Is Boomer ran well? Probably not, because if it were, every other slowpitch park in this area would be out of business.<br>
Can it be? Sure. If they take a step back and look at the big picture and stand by their philosophy that people are out there to have a good time.  <br>
