Chuck is an excellant caster! I don't know if you guys know this but he beat out Steve Rajeff in the ESPN Great Outdoor Games for first place. Anyone that can do that has earned it in my book. If Chuck ran into difficulty, anybody can. He's one of the best fishermen in the world no doubt.<br>

I see some really good teams in the South East qualifier. Some of my old buddies are in there. I'm sure they won't be playing any favors when the cards come out.

Carter is...well, Carter.  He is down at Crooked Island, Bahamas.  He is a scary fisher as well, just look at the Jackson Hole One Fly, not to mention the ESPN GOGs and other list of accomplishments.  <br>
That is a bummer about Chuck and company.  I heard they were 13th by a HAIR in the first day of casting.  I bet ALOT of people, 16 to be exact, were really happy he didn't get to fish.  Kinda makes me want to go out and practice.<br>

<br>
Distance is only <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>one</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the scoring events. The majority of the points will be from accuracy. Andrew seems to think that they are going to have some larger than normal targets though. It will be interesting to see a 6 foot target at 75 feet.<br>
<br>
We'd love to have you there. I'm sure you'd be right there with the best of them yourself. Casting for accuracy can be a little like throwing darts. It is at least &quot;some&quot; luck. Unless your last name is Rajeff. To prove how good a caster he really is I'll be using some of the same rods he casts. If I can just score half his points I'll be happy.<br>

<br>
I guess you have to separate out the competitors somehow, but casting is only one part of it.  From a practical standpoint, many of the very best flyfishers in the country could be eliminated because they've refined their casting to suit their local fishing.  Given a choice of a 75 foot pinpoint cast across a river, or a stealthy approach, proper body positioning, and a carefully executed aerial mend, I'd take the latter 99% of the time. That's how many east coast anglers take fish, day-in and day-out.<br>
<br>
It'd be fun to compete, but I would have no illusions about the likelihood of me winning....<br>

        The middle rings are regular 2 foot diameter rings. The game is really the three targets at 23, 47 feet, and the curve cast, which is at about 30 feet. These are the easy distances, and where you really pile up the points. Hit the center rings 9 times here (you get three casts at each distance -center ring is 300 points- hit all three targets in the middlle three times and that's 2700 points) and you're probably in. Get close (some 200's and you're probablt still in.  Really practice that curve cast. It's casting around a bush. I did really well at the 70 foot ring, well at 23 and 50 feet (I dinged one cast at 50 (0 points), but I didn't do well at the curve cast. Only got 100 points there. I didn't practice the curve, and really don't do much curve casting at all in saltwater fishing. It really hurt me. 70 foot accuracy was easy for me. I'm fishing out there and past it all the time. It really was a short game competition. I'm ready for next time though. I also tied for winning the distance at 98 feet. This was the first time I seriously practiced (for four days) and cast with a 5 weight rod in my life, and I really liked it. I usually use bigger rods, even for my trout fishing. When I put it together I think I could REALLY get some very serious distance with that rod weight. Backhanded of course!  I have to find a rod I really like a lot though. It's a team game, and when all was said and done, we weren't in the fishing. What a good time though. Everyone was very good to eachother. Good luck. Again, do great close, and I think you're in. I plan on coming down to Arkansas some time from late October to early February, probably from sometime Dec. to Feb. To fish the White, Little Red and Tannycomo of course. Speak to you.<br>

What were the top and bottom scores in your group? By the way a curved cast with a full final taper is tough anyway. It would be nice to be able to cut off about 5 feet of the line when it came time to do that cast. It sounds like you did very well. I saw where the Rajeff's scored like 6800 points. Was that a one day total? I can't imagine what you'd have to do to have a score like that.<br>

     The line was the 444 WF Lazerline. I don't know what the scores were. You won't have to score what the Rajeffs did. Believe me. If you get the three close targets really well, you're in. The curve cast really isn't difficult. You will do just fine. Just practice. I used a Gatti two piece rod. It was actually pretty nice. I liked it a lot better than the Sage TCR, which my partner used. I want a rod closer to what I really like though. Just personal preference, and I'm real pickey. <br>
      This is simply a (relatively) close-up accuracy game. The distance events count for relatively few points, by comparison.  Be tough mentally, be relaxed, and have confidence. Again, good luck.<br>
<br>
Hopefully see you in Arkansas. Thanks Andrew.<br>
<br>
                                       All My Best,<br>
