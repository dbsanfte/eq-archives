By Scott Siskind</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I shall begin this class with an apology. I know far less about Babkha than I have about my other three subjects thus far. I have never been a Babkhan, and their history is rather lacking. Also, it's a bit light on the structure and coherence, since I'm writing it at two in the morning. So, I’ll have to piece stuff together, and hopefully Ardashir will come and correct me on anything I get wrong.<br>
<br>
Babkha began on or about October 11, 2000, with Babak Kapav Mehr. He declared himself Shah Babak XXVI and put up a little Babkhan website. This occurred in conjunction with his friend, Thomas Mountain, creating his kingdom of Bathland as a sort of entity within Babkha. I believe there was originally some sort of a plan for Bathland to start out as independent, although I’m not sure, but it became a Babkhan independent territory pretty shortly. Anyhow, back in those days, the big international forum (what MNN and m-n.org are at present) was Micronations Today, a forum run by Thomas Leys, who may or may not have been alive at the time. This provided for a highly optimal moderation situation, so the forum flourished. Anyhow, the Shah posted about the formation of Babkha there, and was immediately attacked by Corvinia, who said the Babkhan fictional history (a long, rambling document no one pays much attention to anymore) was an evil role-playing addition to micronationalism, was cheapening the hobby, et cetera. As those of you familiar with Ravn know, he managed to say this in a way both incredibly polite and incredibly insulting at the same time. Anyway, a number of the people there started defending Babak, including myself and, more importantly, the Rasinate. Eventually everyone got bored and went home, and Babkha started developing normally.<br>
All right. This is where my ignorance is going to come out. Babkha accrued a core group of citizens pretty early on. Tahmaseb Farshbaf, a Finn (!) was the first Grand Vizier. Fath Ali Nouradin was a fanatical Muslim, sort of like Umra, but with more style. Sarhang Ataxerxes was a crazy guy who ruled the province of Zjandria and always talked about murdering people, particularly Treesians. Arben38, apparently unaware that Zoroastrianism had generally died out a few thousand years ago, was a Zoroastrian, and founded the Dark Ocean Society and co-founded the Rastakhiz political party. George Nantell was a Polish (I think) person involved in the law, and was absurdly overcompetent for the position of Minister of Justice, which he received.<br>
<br>
Babkha’s foreign relations at that point were a bit limited. They made overtures to Corvinia despite the earlier bad blood between them, and the Rasinate got really mad and the rest of THAT story is history. Babkhan politics soon took shape, with the Rastakhiz, some crazy pseudo-Zoroastrians, the Liberal Center Party, which was generally very successful, and the Babkhan branch of the People’s Revolutionary Party, led by an “El Doessen” which was constantly harassed for being anti-Babkhan and subversive. There was also a Conservative Party led by Michael Burns which I found stuff about on the site, but I never heard of him or his party ever before, so it couldn’t’ve been too important. The political parties competed over a few major positions, of which the most important was Grand Vizier. Ramin Qajar of Rastakhiz was the second, and Juan Pablo Var was third. That was an interesting Viziership because Var was both a Communist and a Reunionite, both of which were easy targets for his political foes. Next came Pascale Dufoix, and then back to Tahmaseb. But we’re really getting ahead of ourselves. It should be noted that parties and politics used to be MUCH more important in Babkha than they are at present.<br>
<br>
Babkha soon divided its legislature into two houses, a Majlis and a Dewan i Satrapan. The satrapies were sort of like provinces, which had been there since the beginning of the nation and some of which were actually pretty important with their own flags and stuff. <br>
<br>
Babkha’s international relations in mid-2001 were generally based on their strong alliance with the People’s Republic of the New Soviet Empire. This was a real alliance, based on friendship and mutual aid. When the PRNSE started getting into trouble with the Rasinate, Babkha supported them, leading the Rasinate to like them even less than they already did. Culturally, a lot of the PRNSE’s wackiness rubbed off on the Babkhans, and they became more willing to be weird. The Shah Abbas’ Harem bar was opened up, the name based on an old Babkhan legend about an evil guy called Abbas who tried to usurp the throne. That was a fun story. Everyone added a little bit to it and it actually came out okay, although I’m not sure it ever ended. But I digress. At the same time, the Babkhans met up with the Treesians, and various cultural forces combined to create the War of the Orchids, almost certainly the best recwar ever. The air was FILLED with statues of Stalin shot from Nouradin’s catapult. But I digress. When the Free Republic revolted from PRNSE, the Babkhans had a built-in dislike of them from the start. The fact that the FR then joined AtterCom increased the Babkhan dislike, and the fact that Kuralyov started harassing them increased things further. It was then that they started calling communists “Tudehs”, after the name for the Communist party of Iran. Tudeh then became a general insult, as in “Cursed by Ahriman, for he is a vile Tudeh”. The Babkhans hosted a peace conference with the Atterans around September, but it didn’t get too far.<br>
<br>
Around this time, there was also a Persianization of names going on. Sarhang Ataxerxes became Ardashir Khan. El Doessen became Malkom Khan. Conrad Cromien, who I believe was the only Soviet to actually join Babkha, became Hesam Jahandar. A Ghaveh Khanesh, or Coffee House, was set up to discuss issues, with “issues” ending up being how evil Israel was or, when they wanted a change of discussion, how oppressed Palestine was. <br>
<br>
Then Tymaria formed. Babkha suspected, quite correctly, that this was a very Bad Thing for them. They started upping their military a lot. Ardashir Khan became its leader, and, despite the impression he tries to convey, was extremely competent at it. The Navy was also started, although that was always stupid, its leadership by Troy Thompson merely being the latest depths to which it has sunk. Also, SAVAK, named after the old Iranian intelligence agency, was supposed to do their spying. It didn’t work. At least so far as we know.<br>
<br>
I’ll talk about the Tymarian spying more in my Tymaria class, so we can skip that. The major cultural development of the time was the existence of large numbers of talking animals, particularly camels, dogs, and dolphins. These got to be so pervasive and annoying that Shah Babak banished them to Harem Bar, where they remain today, except for Al-Fido haTatak Kalb, who returned to Treesia in disgust, took off his turban, and became just normal old Fido the Talking Dog again.<br>
On March 10, 2002, the unthinkable happened. Shah Babak, the Light of Kapav, decided he was too busy and could not remain Shah of Babkha any longer. He resigned. And worse! His successor was the crazy Zoroastrian general/mass murderer/newspaper editor Ardashir Khan! The Treesians were less than pleased. By Khan rose to the occasion, saying that Babak would forever have a special place in their hearts (and naming a library after him) but that it was time to move on. And they did. Admirably well. One of the best transfers of power I’ve ever seen in a micronation and yet another tribute to the structure that Babak built.<br>
<br>
That brings us to the current age of Babkha. A lot of the old-timers, like Nouradin and Arben, left, and a lot of newcomers, like Benazir and Umra, trickled in. The Babkhans started a crusade to conquer the world by recwar, but were defeated in Treesia and Mondesia. As a sign of more cordial relations with Treesia, they allowed them to open a mission there (in return for a Babkhan mission in Treesia that hasn’t really been used). Which of course led to the perpetual attempts to try and get the Treesian mission OUT of Babkha, thus leading to about half their entire activity load.<br>
Leading us to the very recent present. Babkha is finally holding new Majlis elections after someone noticed that their political system, once the country’s pride and joy, has ceased to exist. They attempted to “unite” with Tymaria, but apparently that’s not happening. Their relationship with Baracao has been on and off, although now they seem to just be ignoring them. And Ardashir, in the reverse pathway of a certain other insane dictator, has gone from genocide to art, making new comics about Babkha and its favorite missionary. <br>
<br>
So, will Babkha become a political simulation once again? Will it evolve into a giant court system sucking life off of Nantell’s seemingly endless supply of legal mumbo-jumbo? Will it become an insane asylum, crazy even for micronationalists? Will it become an Islamic Socialism for Umra? A conservative capitalist state, for Benazir? A crazy group of drunk jerks for Troy? Probably a little bit of each, just as it has been for the past two years, so…GOD SAVE THE SHAH!<br>
