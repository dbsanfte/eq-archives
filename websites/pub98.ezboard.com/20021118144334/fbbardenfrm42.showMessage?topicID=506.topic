Its been rather quiet here lately - so why not liven up proceedings with a dash of controversy.<br>
<br>
The US recently decided NOT to join the World criminal court, together with such countries as Turkey &amp; Iran. It has also recently placed duties on Steel imports, which happen to be illegal under the free trade legislation. Add to this various other issues by which the US has decided to be two faced, and you get a real pissed off rest of the world.<br>
<br>
So, as the worlds second most powerfull democratic establishement, should the EU place trade sanctions on the US?<br>

New Faith in Free Trade <br>
In Break With Allies, Oxfam Backs Globalization <br>
<br>
By Paul Blustein<br>
Washington Post Staff Writer<br>
Thursday, April 11, 2002; Page E01 <br>
<br>
<br>
Breaking with some of its anti-globalization allies, the aid agency Oxfam International issued a report yesterday that praised international trade as a potentially enormous boon to the world's poor and blasted rich countries for maintaining high barriers to products made in developing nations.<br>
<br>
The report combines Oxfam's traditional advocacy on behalf of the poor with uncharacteristic support for free-market economics. It concludes that trade is beneficial but that the United States and the European Union have betrayed their own free-trade principles by tilting the rules of the global trading system overwhelmingly to their advantage.<br>
<br>
The report, titled &quot;Rigged Rules and Double Standards,&quot; is aimed both at shaming the governments of rich countries and rallying the anti-globalization movement behind a more nuanced stance than the hard-line opposition to trade espoused by many activists.<br>
<br>
Rich countries &quot;use their trade policy to conduct what amounts to robbery against the world's poor,&quot; according to the report, citing figures showing that developing countries exporting goods to wealthy nations &quot;face tariff barriers that are four times higher than those encountered by rich countries.&quot;<br>
<br>
That message is embarrassing to the Bush administration, which despite its free-market rhetoric has been reluctant to challenge politically powerful U.S. industries such as textiles that benefit from tariffs protecting their goods from low-cost foreign competition. But the message also throws Oxfam's considerable prestige behind a pro-trade agenda that sets the organization apart from groups that favor protection for labor unions and farmers in rich countries.<br>
<br>
&quot;The extreme element of the anti-globalization movement is wrong,&quot; said Kevin Watkins, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam who wrote most of the report. &quot;Trade can deliver much more [for poor countries] than aid or debt relief.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We're not entirely disassociating ourselves&quot; from other groups that criticize free trade, Watkins continued. &quot;But you can't have an approach that says, 'We insist on the right to sell to you, but you can only sell to us provided there's no powerful constituency involved.' &quot; By launching this campaign, he added, Oxfam hopes to &quot;channel the energy in the anti-globalization movement that's currently involved in trashing McDonald's.&quot;<br>
<br>
The report's reasoning is not entirely based on orthodox free-trade economics. Oxfam criticizes the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for pressing developing countries to open their markets too fast. The group also accuses multinational corporations of running roughshod over labor rights in developing countries and urges the establishment of a new institution to stabilize the price of commodities such as coffee that are key to the economic health of African, Latin American and Asian countries.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, as they launch their trade campaign at a press conference today on Capitol Hill, officials of Oxfam's U.S. chapter are planning to restate the group's opposition to &quot;trade promotion authority,&quot; which the Bush administration is seeking from Congress so that it can initiate negotiations for global and regional trade pacts. Although the report itself doesn't mention the measure, which is also known as &quot;fast track&quot; legislation, it is generally supported by free traders because it binds Congress to hold an up-or-down vote on trade deals struck between U.S. and foreign trade negotiators, with no amendments allowed that might cause the deals to come unstuck.<br>
<br>
But &quot;there is no contradiction&quot; between Oxfam's report and its opposition to trade promotion authority, said Phil Twyford, advocacy director of Oxfam International, because the organization's main concern is that the legislation &quot;doesn't include a mandate&quot; for U.S. negotiators to press for the kinds of market-opening measures that would benefit poor countries. Oxfam does not share the view of some anti-globalization groups that trade deals should be opposed unless they contain strictly enforceable labor standards, Twyford said.<br>
<br>
According to the report, &quot;History makes a mockery of the claim that trade cannot work for the poor&quot; -- some of the most prominent examples being the nations of East Asia, where, &quot;since the mid-1970s, rapid growth in exports has contributed to a wider process of economic growth which has lifted more than 400 million people out of poverty.&quot;<br>
<br>
The problem is that many poor countries have been unable to share in the prosperity fostered by trade, according to the report, both because of barriers to their products and subsidies that rich countries give to some of their producers, especially farmers. To illustrate the point, Oxfam created a &quot;double standards index,&quot; measuring 10 dimensions of rich-country trade policies including average tariffs and restrictions on imports from developing countries.<br>
<br>
&quot;No industrialized country emerges with credit, but the European Union emerges as the worst offender, beating the United States by a short head,&quot; the report said. <br>

<br>
I will only say that although I'm not a political person in the slightest (and at times, I think Bush is 6 eggs short of a dozen), but there is no country in the world whose politicians don't have selfish motivations for doing things.  There is no such country that has politicians who are exactly as they seem at all times, and do everything they do out of concern for the goodwill of humanity.  I will also say that for all the &quot;hatred&quot; out there for Americans, there is no country in the world who hasn't received help from us (either financially, or militarily, or otherwise).  There IS a certain amount of jealousy towards us, because when we speak, the world listens...and that IS the way it is.<br>
<br>
And now that I have ranted, I bid this topic farewell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><img src=http://www.rablade.com/blu/blukitty.gif></center>

You can put a twist on this to make it look any way you want, but what is a country to do. We have labor unions and such fighting for american employees. Working in a foundry to produce steel products is hard work, and it deserves good pay. So the unions make sure employers are paying the American work what it should. Meanwhile, in a third world country, the people will work for $0.25 a day. So, with out Tariffs on imports the american companies wouldn't stand a chance, have to close, and american families have to do without income. Meanwhile ONE man or a few that actually own the business, get rich, while most of the people in the country are still kept in paverty, and still made to work for a few hundred bucks a year.<br>
<br>
Yes, President Bush does have an American first Attitude. Well Duh, he is an American. And i feel we should take of our own before going off to help the world. <p>Those who hear not the music, think the Dancer mad!</p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#200985><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/ujesterson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jesterson</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Technical Guru<br />Network Admin<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-admin.gif /></span><br> <BR><img src=http://www.neoncapital.com/userfiles/ukflag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: Trade wars</span><br><span class=m><font color=#99CCFF>Posted: 5/13/02 2:42:45 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>    <hr size=1> True I totally agree that you should help yourself etc..  <br>
<br>
To be honest, we've got (UK) a strong country. <br>
<br>
We go through our bad patches every now and then like every country does.. I'm not jealous of the USA, not at all. I think that statement is wrong.. I just think some of the things Americans do to help themselves cause upset elsewhere around the world. It is unfair, like Americans would whinge if we did it to them, yes? (you would) To be honest I totally respect the USA for a lot of things (believe me). Its all about personal opinions, I'm not going to have a go at anyone in this thread..<br>
<br>
I think (for me personally) that one of the main reasons I get frustrated with this country is having to stick to EU guidelines on everything, we don't get to do things for ourselves. I mean how can other countries tell us what is right or wrong in our own land/country?! It really pisses me off! I don't mind being part of Europe, but I don't see why we have to be goverened by 'them'. Tony Blair has always been Pro-European anyway, so its bound to happen eventually. We're going to end up using the Euro in 5 years as well I rekon, it all BITES.<br>
<br>
I take an active interest in politics, I think is a very hard job for people to do. I have 4 mates who all did degree's in politics so I get my fair share of opinions accross and slated sometimes for that matter.<br>
<br>
Lets face it though, the Americans have the knack of treading on everyone else to get what they want?? Don't they? (In my opinion) Take the EU Pollution treaty (forget the name for a minute, it will come back to me). Its ok for the americans to bail out and pollute 'our' Air with shit because it makes them more money?? The USA is one of the biggest offenders of Air pollition. Stuff like that.. Of course we're going to be concerned<br>
<br>
Anyway I am at work!! I will add to this debate later<br>

<br>
Anyway...<br>
Make me european premier type person and I will kill G. Bush - except I really like Americans..<br>
<br>
I think the americans are dirty scumbags however when it comes to polution. I have no ideas about figures but they produce 8% of X and use 30% of X, and that means they use a hell of a lot of X!! save of X! (whats X again...)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I also like Americans, let's not forget...<br>
<br>
But they really are big fatso's, get up off your asses and stop eating. You are meant to be an advanced nation, so show the future worlds something good, not how they will turn out if they eat too much bacon...<br>
<br>
I am a hippy irish freak...so leave me alone..<br>
Maybe slightly racist, but I only do it for the Americans good...<br>
<br>
Sure I have the US flag up on my wall, that I haggled for on Times Sq. $4 was way too much! lol<br>
<br>
(haggled the right word?)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I like americans, spread the sweet lovin' <p>::

<br>
All I will say is I dislike the american governement intensely, they have no concern for the world at large and are only interested in furthering their own ends. They refuse to sign up to anti pollution agreements becasue it doesn't suit their economy, they're pretty much the only large western power to refuse and their refusal endangers the entire planet. Imo they are one of the worst governments for being selfish and warmongering, certainly out of the larger countrys. <br>
<br>
Just let me say I have lots of american friends, I like americans fine, I just dislike their government. And their policys. So my post not anti american just anti american government. :P <p><BR><CENTER>===Silva===</CENTER><BR><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.silvas-world.co.uk">Silva's World</A></CENTER>

Especially at the borders, it's so easy to make money quick...they do show a lot of companies getting caught, but I reckon if you knew how many didn't you would be surprised...<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to Bush and his evilness. Hear about the nuclear deal he reached with Russia? The deal is they will cut down on nuclear missiles over the next 10 years, yet at the end they will both still have enough to destory each other! Instead of destroying the missiles, which the russian guy disliked, they have agreed to put the missiles into storage, basically meaning they are still there but not accounted for!<br>
<br>
And as for anti-defence missiles, thats just crap too, americans will never feel safe, as they will never be any more safe than me!<br>
<br>
OK, so now I have a million american snipers hunting me down, I still feel safe, honestly..<br>
