“Who are these guys?” Dylan grumbled as he steered the Eureka Maru away from a barrage of missiles heading toward them from a Nietzschean vessel. He managed to avoid all of the missiles but one that nicked the hull. The Maru shuddered, causing some sparks to fall from the ceiling. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“It’s another unidentified Nietzschean vessel,” Rommie said, manning the navigation controls. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Open a channel,” Dylan ordered. “Unknown vessel, this is the Eureka Maru. Why are you firing at us?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“They’re not answering,” Rommie said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Thank you,” Dylan said, rolling the Maru to the left as more missiles were ejected from the enemy ship. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Whoa!” called Harper as he fell into the cockpit. Pushing himself to his feet, the engineer staggered forward, clutching the pilot’s chair for dear life as Dylan rolled the Maru to the right, dodging more missiles. “Boss, give a guy a warning when you do that next time.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Warning!” Dylan said, pulling back on the controls. The Maru jolted backwards, hitting the enemy missiles with the engine fire. The missiles blew and the Maru flew forward from the blast. Rommie held on to the control station, while Harper fell back, slamming into the railing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Thanks, Boss,” Harper wheezed, the wind blown out of him from knocking into the rail. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No problem. Mr. Harper, do we have slipstream?” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Barely. I think she could only handle one jump. Those missiles pack a wallop,” Harper said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Then we’d better make it count,” Dylan said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Finding nearest slip point to me,” Rommie said. She stopped in the middle of her search. “Dylan, I’m detecting another slipstream event.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“What is it this time? The Ogami?” Dylan asked. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Wouldn’t that be perfect?” Harper added. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“No. Five slip fighters in Flying V formation heading towards the Nietzscheans,” Rommie said. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Flying V?” Harper asked, moving close to the pilot’s chair. His eyes wide, the young engineer looked outside the windows, watching the slip fighters pass over them. <br>
<br>
They fired on the Nietzschean ship, doing massive damage to the hull. Two fighters went to the rear while the other three stayed to the front. The rear fighters rolled around the hull, firing at every chance. The three front fighters flew straight at the ship, playing a game of chicken until the Nietzscheans pulled up, exposing the reserve AP tanks, which the fighters quickly fired on. Darting out of the way, the five fighters dodged the explosion ripping throughout the entire ship. <br>
<br>
“They’re good,” Dylan commented. <br>
<br>
“And they’re coming towards us,” Rommie said. The five fighters stopped in front of the Maru, hovering in a Flying V formation. The slip fighter in front was different from the rest. The claw-like wings were scorched a deep black like it had seen too many battles while the others were still silver, still new looking. <br>
<br>
“This is Captain Dylan Hunt of the Andromeda Ascendant, please identify yourselves,” Dylan said. A face appeared on the plasma screen above them. It was an older man with white hair tied back in a pony tail. Wrinkles lined his face. His soulful, brown eyes looked sunken in, giving him the appearance of a man who’d been to Hell and back. He managed to give Dylan a disbelieving grin.<br>
<br>
“Andromeda Ascendant? I thought she was a bit…bigger,” he said, his voice filled with energy despite what his face revealed. <br>
<br>
“She is, and you’re welcome to come see her. Thanks for the rescue…”<br>
<br>
“Ezekiel Boone. Everyone calls me Zeke.”<br>
<br>
“Ezekiel Boone?” Harper whispered in shock. He looked straight at Zeke. “The Hell’s Angels?”<br>
<br>
Zeke chuckled. “I didn’t know anyone knew about us out here.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, wow! Freakin’ WOW!” Harper exclaimed, his eyes wild and giddy with excitement. <br>
<br>
“Well, I guess you have the approval of my engineer,” Dylan said. He looked over his shoulder at Rommie. <br>
<br>
“I’d be happy to have them on aboard,” Rommie said. <br>
<br>
“Zeke, if you and your crew will follow me?” Dylan said. Zeke nodded.<br>
<br>
“Lead on, Captain Hunt.”<br>

<br>
The Maru managed to make it to the Andromeda with few complications. Harper knew it would take him a few hours to repair the minimal damage to the slipstream drive, but he was too preoccupied with the new guests that were currently landing in Hanger 4. He rushed out of the Maru, wanting to be there to meet Zeke Boone. <br>
<br>
“Harper, wait up,” Dylan said, following him down the corridor.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, Boss?” <br>
<br>
“Do you know this man?”<br>
<br>
“There ain’t a man, woman, or child on Earth who doesn’t know Zeke Boone,” Harper said, keeping his stride fast as he and Dylan continued walking. Dylan was amazed how quickly the young man was moving. “He’s like King Arthur, Robin Hood, and Jesse James all wrapped up into one guy.”<br>
<br>
“He’s that famous?”<br>
<br>
“More like infamous. At least to the Nietzscheans.”<br>
<br>
“What did he do?”<br>
<br>
Harper paused, thinking back to all the stories he’d heard as a child. “From what my dad always told me, Zeke Boone lived in the New York camps on Earth. One day, the Dragons came and took his wife and son as slaves. Boone snapped. He snuck aboard a Nietzschean ship and hijacked it, demanding to know where his wife and kid were. They wouldn’t tell him, so he decided to get his revenge.”<br>
<br>
Harper stopped, thinking about his parents and their deaths and how he’d wanted to seek revenge so badly. <br>
<br>
“And?” Dylan prompted after seeing the pained look in Harper’s eyes. Harper shook the memories aside.<br>
<br>
“He flew the hijacked ship to Fountain Head, rigged it to self destruct, and escaped in a slip fighter. He was the first to ever make a successful raid on the Nietzschean home world. From then on, whenever we heard about bombings of Nietzschean ships, or mysterious supplies turning up in the camps, or anything remotely bad for the Dragons, we knew it was Boone,” Harper said. <br>
<br>
“Boone? Like Ezekiel Boone?” asked Beka, coming up behind them. <br>
<br>
“You know about him?” Dylan asked.<br>
<br>
Beka chuckled. “There isn’t a pilot in the universe who doesn’t know his name. I used to dream I’d meet him and he’d recruit me for his Hell’s Angels.”<br>
<br>
“He’s in Hanger 4,” Dylan said. Beka’s eyes bulged. She looked at Harper who was nodding his head, the excitement returning to his face.<br>
<br>
“Oh my God! What are we doing standing around here? Let’s go!” she said. Harper ran down the corridor, Beka right behind him. They were both laughing with excitement. Dylan was ready to join them when Andromeda’s hologram appeared in front of him. <br>
<br>
“Dylan, the Commonwealth ship Sword of Damocles is requesting an audience with you in your office,” Andromeda said. <br>
<br>
“I’ll be there in a minute,” he said. Andromeda nodded and disappeared. <br>
<br>
Dylan made his way to Hanger 4. Beka and Harper waited patiently, though he could see the anxious excitement. They were meeting their hero today. The door opened and five men stepped into the corridor. <br>
<br>
“Captain Hunt, I presume?” Zeke said, shaking Dylan’s hand. <br>
<br>
“You’d be correct, Mr. Boone.”<br>
<br>
“Please, call me Zeke,” he said. He looked over his shoulder at the four other men. All of them looked like punks from the worst backwater drifts. They were all younger than Zeke by at least twenty years. “These are my boys: Marcus Jackson, Simeon West, Felix Munroe, and Levi Perry.”<br>
<br>
Jackson was the taller of the four men and the only clean looking one of the lot. His hair was jet black, hanging to his shoulders, his brown eyes deep and playful. He looked at Beka and winked. Blinking in surprise, Beka smiled back. <br>
<br>
West looked to be more of the actual punk of the group. His entire outfit was composed of leather and his hair was spiked and dyed a brilliant neon green; around his neck a spiked collar. <br>
<br>
Munroe kept his arms crossed over his chest, a look of indifference etched into his face. His bald head reflected the overhead lights. His eyes searched the area, seemingly on the lookout for anything dangerous. Dylan saw him as a smaller version of Tyr.<br>
<br>
Perry was small and dirty with oily brown hair messily combed over his eyes. His body stood rigidly, eyes darting around nervously. He must have been the newest addition to the group. He didn’t stand with the same ease as the others. He stayed close to Zeke like a child staying close to a parent. <br>
Dylan shook hands with all the men.<br>
<br>
“Allow me to introduce part of my crew. This is Beka Valentine, my First Officer,” he said. Beka smiled, bowing her head slightly, “and my engineer, Seamus Harper.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, wow!” Harper said, shaking Zeke’s hand. “I – I…Boston Camp. I’m from Boston Camp.”<br>
<br>
“Imagine that! A mudfoot this far out in space? And an engineer!” Zeke said, slapping Harper on the back. “Maybe you can take a look at my little girl.”<br>
<br>
“Black-black Beauty? Oh, wow!” Harper exclaimed. He pushed past the small group, walking into the hanger. He stared in awe at the slip fighter parked in front. Beka came up behind him, putting a hand on his shoulder. He looked ready to cry from overwhelming joy. “I never thought…My dad always told me, but I never thought…Beka…”<br>
<br>
“I know,” she said. <br>
<br>
“Well, why don’t I have Harper and Beka show you around? I have some business I need to attend to,” Dylan said, “but I’ll see you all shortly.”<br>
<br>
“Harper, come on, let’s go,” Beka said, barely able to get the young engineer out of the hanger, his eyes glued to the black slip fighter. <br>
<br>
“But, Beka…” Harper began. <br>
<br>
“I know,” she said, smiling sympathetically. “Later.”<br>
<br>
Beka led the way with Harper excitedly jumping around Zeke, telling him about everything he could do to the slip fighters to make them faster and more powerful for the next raid on a Nietzschean ship. Dylan sighed, wishing he could join them. But the duties of a captain called him to his office. <br>

<br>
<br>
“We were sorry to hear about your recent attack, Dylan,” said Madame Galina, the Commonwealth’s new Executive of Negotiations. She was a beautiful woman, her blonde hair done up in a bun, displaying the Commonwealth uniform proudly. <br>
<br>
Dylan shrugged. “It couldn’t be prevented. At least the mission went well. We made a pact with a small colony of Nietzscheans out of Coyote Pride.”<br>
<br>
“I’m surprised you were able to get away from your attackers. Many ships that have gone up against the unknown Nietzscheans have not lived to tell their story,” she said, smiling curiously. <br>
<br>
“I had a little help.”<br>
<br>
“From who?”<br>
<br>
“Ezekiel Boone and his Hell’s Angels.”<br>
<br>
Madame Galina’s face became even more interested. “I see. I’ve heard stories about him, but I never thought he actually existed.”<br>
<br>
“Two members of my crew seem to think he’s the real deal. How’re things going with you?”<br>
<br>
“That’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about, Dylan,” she said, her composure becoming more dignified as she went into government official mode. <br>
<br>
“Go ahead.”<br>
<br>
“We were recently contacted by the Drago-Kazov.” Dylan frowned. “They want to initiate negotiations.”<br>
<br>
Dylan eyed her suspiciously. “You’re kidding, right?”<br>
<br>
“I asked the very same question. And out of good faith, they delivered to us a fully functional plasma cannon. They wish to negotiate a peace treaty,” she said, barely able to contain her excitement. <br>
<br>
“Peace treaty?”<br>
<br>
“We’re taking it slow. At least a peace treaty is a step in the right direction.”<br>
<br>
“What about the slave planets in their custody? What about Earth?” Dylan asked, feeling his face heat up in anger. “We can’t negotiate peace with slavers.”<br>
<br>
“I can’t ask them to order the main course when all they want is the appetizer, Dylan. We have to take this slow,” she said, calmly, her face now void of emotion. Dylan let out a deep, frustrated sigh. <br>
<br>
“And this is why you wanted to contact me?” he asked. <br>
<br>
“No. The Drago-Kazov wish to have the Andromeda Ascendant present during negotiations as our sign of good faith,” she said. <br>
<br>
“They want the Andromeda present? Why?”<br>
<br>
“Because you initiated the Commonwealth and they want this to be officially recognized by the founder they’ve heard so much about,” she said. <br>
<br>
“Are you sure this is wise, Galina? It could be a trap,” Dylan said. He realized he sounded a bit like Harper. The engineer’s paranoia was rubbing off at the strangest times. <br>
<br>
“We are taking that into account and are fully prepared in case of an attack. We only need you to come to the Mar System so that negotiations can begin,” she said. Dylan paused, leaning against the wall by his desk. He didn’t want to go. The Drago-Kazov were nothing but trouble and he refused to believe they would willingly initiate negotiations with the Commonwealth. But if it were true, then they’d be one step closer to a united Commonwealth and he could finally fulfill his promise to Harper with the eventual liberation of Earth. He had to chance it. <br>
<br>
“All right. We’ll be there,” he said. “Dylan out.”<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *<br>
<br>
“Dylan, are you nuts?” Harper exclaimed. “It’s gotta be a trap!”<br>
<br>
Dylan smiled to himself, hearing the engineer’s response. <br>
<br>
“I agree with Harper. Negotiating with the Drago-Kazov will yield nothing but damaged warships,” Tyr said, leaning against a console. <br>
<br>
“We can’t not try,” Dylan argued, though he was more inclined to agree with his crew. <br>
<br>
“Sure we can. Just call Madame What’s-Her-Name and tell her, ‘No dice! We’ve got a prior commitment to meet our deaths somewhere else,’” Harper said. <br>
<br>
“We’re going,” Dylan said. <br>
<br>
“Do you really want this, Dylan?” Tyr asked. <br>
<br>
“Honestly? No, I don’t.”<br>
<br>
“Then why are we arguing about this?” Harper asked. Dylan put his hands on Harper’s shoulders.<br>
<br>
“Because Earth will be closer to freedom if this goes well,” Dylan said. Harper’s eyes hardened on Dylan, becoming intensely focused. <br>
<br>
“Screw the Dragons, Dylan! Earth’ll be free someday, but not like this! Not after we coddle and pamper the Dragons into being our good buddies!” Harper shouted. He stopped himself from going any further. His chest heaved with heavy, angry breaths. He closed his eyes for a moment, gaining his composure. “I gotta go. Zeke’s waiting for me in the machine shop.”<br>
<br>
“Harper…”<br>
<br>
“Just don’t, Dylan,” Harper said, leaving the room. Dylan looked at Tyr. The Nietzschean’s face remained stoically passive, though there was a flash of sympathy for Harper as the engineer walked out. <br>
<br>
“I do hope this is worth it,” Tyr said.<br>
<br>
“It had better be,” Dylan sighed.<br>

The last person Beka expected to see in the Maru was one of Boone’s men. Jackson was standing in the cockpit, looking at the various instruments and pushing against the controls. He seemed fascinated with everything on board. She had to admit that he looked kind of cute.<br>
<br>
“I was wondering where you’d gone off to,” Beka said. Jackson turned to face her. He grinned, his face becoming even more handsome. There was something about slick-looking, bad boys that just made her melt. <br>
<br>
“This ship is…interesting,” Jackson said. <br>
<br>
Beka smiled. “Thanks for being polite about it.”<br>
<br>
“Hey, I’ve seen worse ships around some of the drifts I used to hang around. Before Zeke gave me a purpose,” he said. <br>
<br>
“I used to dream I’d run into him. Flying around, giving the Nietzscheans a thing or two to think about,” she said, gazing into his eyes. Jackson approached her. Unconsciously, Beka’s hand hovered over her force lance. <br>
<br>
“Seems to me you’ve done pretty well for yourself,” he said. “Restoring the Commonwealth; flying around and blasting Nietzschean warships out of the sky.”<br>
<br>
“Yep, it’s a living,” she said, laughing. She noticed he was getting closer to her. Their faces were mere inches away from one another. Something inside her made her want to run from him. But a larger part of her made her stay. <br>
<br>
“It must be nice, living on a ship with warm beds and fresh coffee,” he said. His statement wasn’t said with any malice. He was just stating a fact. Both of them were the products of drifts, constantly scraping to make ends meat, never knowing where the next throne would come from. <br>
<br>
“It has its drawbacks,” she said. She felt him put his hand on her waist. She put her hand on her shoulder. <br>
<br>
“Like?” he asked, bringing his face closer. Their lips hovered apart before he leaned in and kissed her. Beka stiffened for a second before giving in and kissing him back. She hadn’t felt this way since Bobby. Her hands moved to his neck, caressing him. He started to pull her shirt up. She pushed away from him. They were both panting from the excitement. “What?”<br>
<br>
“Not here,” she breathed. She took his hand. “My quarters.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, ma’am,” he said enthusiastically. <br>

That's why my first two stories were short. I had other ideas and I finished the stories a bit prematurely.<br>

I'm trying to get out of the habit. I've been going through the stories I have saved on my computer and I'm adding to them.

Tyr punched the bag over and over again, getting into the rhythm of his workout. He knew little about the five individuals that were currently roaming the corridors and visiting with the crew, but he knew that they were enemies of Nietzscheans. Though he had no bone blades to show his lineage, he assumed that at least one of them would be able to tell. As much as he would have liked to flex his muscles around the men and show them who and what he was, he knew it wasn’t worth the trouble if they were only going to be on the Andromeda for a short time. Taking that into consideration, he’d made himself scarce, staying in the gym and his quarters.   <br>
<br>
“It’s quite an amazing ship,” said an unfamiliar voice. Tyr turned toward the door and saw Munroe leaning against the doorway, watching. The human was bare headed and overly muscular, an inch or two shorter than Tyr. <br>
<br>
“She has proven herself to be, yes,” Tyr answered. He couldn’t avoid the human now that he’d wandered into the gym. Whatever happened would happen based on how the conversation went. <br>
<br>
“Felix Munroe,” he said, extending his hand. Tyr merely stared at it until the human nervously put his hand down. Munroe regained his composure, putting on a passive expression. <br>
<br>
“Tyr Anasazi,” Tyr said.<br>
<br>
“Haven’t seen you around. I was told there were six on this crew,” Munroe said. <br>
<br>
“Should it matter that you have not seen me?” Tyr asked. <br>
<br>
Munroe let a slight grin escape. “You’ll have to forgive me. I’m used to making sure everything is secure. Zeke is considered very dangerous to the Dragons and they’re always after him.”<br>
<br>
“You hold a great deal of animosity towards the Drago-Kazovs,” Tyr said. <br>
<br>
“I’m from Los Angeles, of course I have animosity,” Munroe said. “I’m sure you do. What camp are you from?”<br>
<br>
“I’m from no camp,” Tyr said, more edge to his voice than he would have liked. He couldn’t stand that this human was treating him as if they were equals in some way. Munroe raised his hands in peace.<br>
<br>
“Sorry. You must have lived outside of the camps,” he said. “I used to hear stories about those poor bastards who lived outside the garrisons. Magog raids, famines…gives me the shivers just thinking about it. How did you guys survive it all?” Tyr punched the bag with so much ferocity that it flew off the chain link holding it up. <br>
<br>
“Tyr Anasazi of Kodiak Pride is not from Earth!” Tyr shouted. After his sudden burst of rage, Tyr realized his mistake. Munroe backed up, raising his gun, aiming straight at Tyr’s chest.<br>
<br>
“Niezschean!” he shouted. On his free arm, Munroe had a communications gauntlet. He raised it to his mouth. “Zeke, we have a Nietzschean.” He looked back at Tyr when his message was complete. “Now we’ll see what your fate has in store.”<br>
<br>
“I am not Drago-Kazov. I am Kodiak,” Tyr said calmly. <br>
<br>
“Doesn’t matter. You’re all the same. All arrogant; believing you’re better than the rest of us. You make me sick! I lost my little brother because of your kind! He never did anything but try to live and your people wouldn’t even let him do that!” Munroe shouted, all of his pain rising to the surface. <br>
<br>
“Kodiak Pride never had slaves! I’ve done nothing to your kind,” Tyr said. <br>
<br>
“I don’t care. The only good Nietzschean is a dead Nietzschean,” Munroe said. The door opened. Zeke, West, and Perry ran in, weapons raised immediately. <br>
<br>
“I thought this place was too good to be true,” Zeke said. The door opened again. Dylan, Rommie, and Harper rushed inside. <br>
<br>
“Zeke! What’re you doing?” Dylan asked. <br>
<br>
“You have a Nietzschean on board, Dylan. Don’t tell me the man who restored the Commonwealth would let the very people who destroyed it live comfortably on his ship,” Zeke said, his voice dripping with bitterness. <br>
<br>
“Tyr is a member of my crew. He’s my tactical officer. I trust him with my life,” Dylan said. <br>
<br>
“How do I know you’re telling the truth, Dylan? I’ve only just met you. You could be working for the Nietzscheans,” Zeke said. <br>
<br>
“But I’m not,” Harper said, moving in front of Tyr. The little engineer was now in the line of fire. <br>
<br>
“Harper!” Rommie said.<br>
<br>
“I know what I’m doing, Rommie,” Harper said. He looked at Zeke. “Zeke, I’m from Boston. We took more hits than most. Nobody hates the Nietzscheans more than me.”<br>
<br>
“Then move out of the way,” Zeke said.<br>
<br>
“No,” Harper said. “Because, as much as I hate the Niezscheans, I won’t let you kill Tyr. He’s my…friend.” Tyr seemed surprised by Harper’s admission, though he wondered if he said it to keep Zeke from shooting or if he really meant the words. <br>
<br>
“Friends? Humans and Nietzscheans can’t be friends!” Munroe scoffed. Harper glared at Munroe. <br>
<br>
“Tyr’s saved my life more times than I can count. That makes him a friend in my book!” he said. “Come on, Zeke. If a guy from Boston can trust a Nietzschean, maybe you can too.”<br>
Zeke held his position. His hardened eyes were set on killing Tyr. But having Harper standing in front of the Nietzschean, his blue eyes imploring for the life of his “friend,” made him think otherwise. He lowered his gun. Looking to his men, he made sure they did the same. <br>
<br>
“All right, kid. I won’t kill him,” Zeke said. Harper sighed in relief. “I’ll just try and stay away from the Uber for the remainder of our stay.”<br>
<br>
“Zeke, could I have a word with you in my office?” Dylan asked. Zeke nodded. Dylan looked over to Rommie and nodded. The android stood behind Zeke, guarding him as he walked out of the room and down the corridor. Dylan stared at Zeke’s men. “Please leave, before I have you escorted to the brig.”<br>
<br>
Munroe, West, and Perry left. They ran into Jackson and Beka when the door opened. <br>
<br>
“What happened?” Jackson asked.<br>
<br>
“You missed all the fun,” Munroe said. They led Jackson away. Beka entered the gym. Harper was breathing heavily. His body shook from the rush of adrenaline that slowly left his body. <br>
<br>
“Mr. Harper…” Dylan began.<br>
<br>
“I know, I know…” Harper said.<br>
<br>
“Good work,” Dylan finished. Harper looked at the captain in surprise. Dylan gave Harper a pat on the back before leaving the gym. Tyr put his hand on Harper’s shoulder, turning the engineer around to face him.<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” he said. It was all the Nietzschean would allow himself to say. He left the gym and a stunned Harper and Beka. <br>
<br>
“Okay, what happened?” Beka asked Harper. Harper grinned.<br>
<br>
“I’ll tell ya on the way,” Harper said. Beka followed him, listening to the explanation of the events that had transpired in her absence. <br>
