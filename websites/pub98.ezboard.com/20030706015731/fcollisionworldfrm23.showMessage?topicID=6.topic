Nina, having concluded that she needed to become stronger if she encountered characters such as Leon ever again, wandered into the nearest dojo. She sadly noted that her skills weren't up to paar, which was a careless, often lethal mistake in her profession.<br>
<br>
She peered, balancing her sword on her shoulders casually. A dull breeze swept through the seemingly vacant dojo. &quot;Helloooo?&quot; she called out hesitantly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurairyu0>KuraiRyu 0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/21/03 10:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...hmm? *raises hand to greet the newcomer*</span><hr size=1> Ryu looks up, eyes slightly squinted. His concentration fades slowly, and he beams a kind smile her way. <br>
&quot;Well then, have you come here to train your mind? body? or both? Either is fine with me. I am open for any kind you wish&quot;<br>
He slowly rises from sitting, black cloak enveloping most of his body, aside from his head. He slowly walks a few steps to the right side of the room, next to an old wooden table. Pulling a temble from beneath his cloth belt, he pours some sake into two small cups. Then, he lifts one up and holds it in her direction.<br>
&quot;Care for a drink after your long travels?&quot;... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninainhertz>Nina Inhertz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/22/03 12:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Mmmm sake! ^_^</span><hr size=1> Nina smiles and nods enthusiastically, accepting the drink from this mysterious cloaked figure and kneeling on the floor next to the wooden table.<br>
<br>
A somewhat awkward silence ensued, as the man was clearly in meditation as he tentatively sipped from the beverage now and then.<br>
<br>
Nina, however, downed the sake in two and a half gulps and set the cup to rest on the table. &quot;Sooo . . .&quot; she began nonchalantly, glancing at the other's sword that rested some feet away from its owner, &quot;What's your story?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurairyu0>KuraiRyu 0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/22/03 2:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My story eh? </span><hr size=1> The man smiled a bit, and began.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... first off, my name is Ryu. I have been wandering for quite a long time, and i decided to make a small pitstop for some peace and quiet.&quot;<br>
<br>
He notices she downed her sake pretty quickly, and thinks to himself ((hmm, either she has a very high tolerance like me, or she likes to get a bit drunk...)) Then silences his stupid inner voice... and pours more sake into her cup and sets the temble on the table. Also he notices her looking at his sword...<br>

&quot;The name is Nina . . . Nina Inhertz! Infamous bounty huntress and sorceress supreme! Perhaps you've heard of me??&quot; she asks hopefully after striking an intimidating pose, while managing to balance the sake cup and sip at it occasionally.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um . . .&quot; Ryu wasn't quite sure how to respond.<br>
<br>
Nina sighs dejectedly and decides it would be best to shut up and finish her sake first. &quot;S'okay, not many have.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurairyu0>KuraiRyu 0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/24/03 8:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *Smiles warmly*</span><hr size=1> Ryu smiles and replies,<br>

 He sipped his sake again <br>
&quot;By the way, i also practice some magic skills, even though my main abilities are not in the arcane arts, but the sword. Do you have any experience with weaponry?&quot;<br>

<br>
She picks up and handles her katana with both hands; it was the most gentle action that Ryu had yet to see, regarding her somewhat abrupt and cursory movements from before. She treated it like it was a fine and delicate thing, and it did look rather ancient.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sort of a family heirloom really,&quot; she begins, then pauses, deciding to throw all deceptive narratives out the window, &quot;Aw heck . . . actually, I stole it from the temple they were holding me in when I was younger . . . though thats another story right there . . . biggest mistake I made, but I've grown sort of . . . 'attached' to it . . .&quot; she explains, a hint of sarcasm in her voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd certainly like to hear more of that story,&quot; Ryu interjects thoughtfully (OOC: hehe, dunno if you truly do, Ryu <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Nina tilted her head to the side playfully. This woman switched between moods faster than an actress can change costume. Or perhaps it was just the sake . . . &quot;Tell you what . . . I'll clue you in on some things if you duel me. You seem like a pretty strong guy, and truth is, I need a good fight to get my ego up after my last, uh, mishap.

<br>
Ryu was a bit shocked at hearing this... the girl looked rather delicate from her figure, but he didnt let that fool him as he did in the past. He knew never to underestimate his opponent. He looked at her for a moment, closed his eyes, and replied,<br>
 <br>
&quot;I usually dont do duels for sport or fun, but if it will truely help you with your moral problem, then i accept your challenge...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ryu stood up and walked to the middle of the room, and raised his finger, signaling a 'come here'. He unsheathed his giant sword, paused for a moment, then remembered to warn her of something.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just a heads up, i am also more than i seem in battle. Dont think because of this heavy-looking sword that i am any slower than most, okay? Well then, shall we begin? I havent dueled in a while, but lets say the first to hit the side-torso area with the flat of the blade, alright?&quot;<br>

Ryu speculated, by the sight of her attire underneath, that she was one to instigate a fair amount of fights . . . as her clothes were ratty and teared, being held together by mere safety pins. Bu~t thats besides the point . . . <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The sword felt Nina's excitement as well, and longed for its bloodlust to be satiated. Ryu's eyes widened only slightly as the sword flew into her outstretched hand, the blade radiating with a slight tinge of blue. He narrowed his eyes in questioning as Nina lowered her voice to an inaudiable whisper, but it looked as if she were scolding the sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you dare think of it . . .&quot; she was whispering, &quot;I'm not in the mood to make enemies at the moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
The blade made a sound, similar to a dejected sigh if one could deem it had personality, and the blue sheen dimmed. Satisfied with the blade's agreeable nature, she sweeped her sword in front of her and leapt forward over the low table, now mere feet away from her somewhat confused opponent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right then . . . your move&quot; She offered, smiling in good nature, despite a somewhat forboding stance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hotaruvalentine>Hotaru Valentine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/30/03 9:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heh you and your safety pins</span><hr size=1> (This message was left blank) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hotaruvalentine>Hotaru Valentine</A> at: 6/10/03 12:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurairyu0>KuraiRyu 0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(5/1/03 4:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ((quicky!))</span><hr size=1> ((OOC: um steph? did you actually read it b4 u stepped in? its vacant ^^ no old asian men here o.O sorry to burst ur bubble...))<br>

Ryu launched toward Nina and thrusted his sword forward. Nina proceeded to block and counter with a few deft movements before realizing that this man was definitely more than he seemed. She'd have to kick it up a notch . . .<br>
<br>
The two were at it for awhile, recently accquainted friends now detached combatants with only one objective. Even though it was a seemingly harmless duel, both fought with equal fervor and agression, though more so in the feisty sorceress.<br>
<br>
Nina loved battle. It demanded the utmost concentration, disavowing all doubts in her mind. In battle, the goal was always evident over the often hazy horizon of moral complications, and it was either a win or lose situation. Simple enough . . .<br>
<br>
But this was certainly a challenging match. Ryu had almost contacted the flat of his blade with her side. Nina, however, quickly discerned this movement and, using her sword in an unconventional way, vaulted over his head and landed behind him.<br>
<br>

<br>
The kodachi went right through her . . .<br>
<br>
Ryu blinked in astonishment as Nina's smirking face suddenly became transparent, along with the rest of her, diffusing and finally vanishing altogether, save for a single slip of white paper that floated delicately to the dojo's floor . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;What the-?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Doink!&quot; Nina's voice emphasized as the flat of her katana came from behind and smacked itself rather forcefully against the man's side.<br>
<br>
Ryu staggered slightly whilst Nina simply swung her sword over he shoulder and burst into laughter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bwhahaha! I win!&quot; she declared triumphantly. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

&quot;I guess you win then, even if it was by unfair means. Say, was that your speed? Or a technique? If it was speed i applaude you, but if it were a technique... well... i also applaude you. But i discourage you from using that in future duels unless you want a bounty on your head.&quot;<br>

A slight frown appeared over and replaced her previous triumphant expression.<br>
<br>
With a huff she relinquished her weapon and dropped to the floor, Her arms wound tightly around her legs and chin resting on her knees.<br>
<br>
&quot;Too late for that . . .&quot; she uttered in a small voice after a brief pause.<br>
<br>
Ryu arched an eyebrow, &quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nina's frown was replaced with the hint of a humorous smile, but subsequently vanished after she took her eyes of Ryu. She suddenly felt too tired to keep up her usual shannigans. Instead, she contemplated on her previous excursions in the past . . . what was it? Only a matter of days? Time moved too fast for its own good.<br>
<br>
She then realized that Ryu was still intent on a followup to her comment . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you ever get the feeling that your past is always tying you down to things?&quot; she asked him, her eyes expectant for an answer . . . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurairyu0>KuraiRyu 0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(6/11/03 3:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> my apologies</span><hr size=1> &quot;Heh, more than you know miss Nina&quot;, he replied with a bit of regret in his voice.<br>

Ryu held his hand out kindly and signaled to come sit with him and have a bit more to drink. He didnt exactly know what to say, so his hospitality took over.

<br>
&quot;Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it,&quot; Ryu replies thoughtfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean . . . why succumb to being the hunted when you can be the hunter? Yeah, that sounds about right . . .&quot; Nina murmured, sounding like she was trying to convince herself more than Ryu. &quot;It makes for an interesting lifestyle anyways . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
She sipped at her drink absentmindedly for a moment, until bolting upright and jumping to her feet. The action was so immediate it even startled the stoic Ryu.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hark! My plot development sensors are responding!&quot; she exclaimed dramatically and (because this RPGer with no sense of appropriate transition is suffering severe writer's block) grabbed her cumbersome possessions and dashed out of the dojo to meet Zil and her companions at the colleges . . . <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
