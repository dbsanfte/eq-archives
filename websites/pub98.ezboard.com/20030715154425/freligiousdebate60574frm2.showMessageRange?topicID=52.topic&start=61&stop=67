<br>
There are actually 2 distinct creation stories in the OT, but this is from the second. If your god didn’t want to prohibit Adam and Eve from eating of the tree, because it would be a good thing for death to occur and other spirits to come down to fulfill a celestial requirement outside his own powers or influence then way say this, “And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it (verse 15).  And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat (verse 16):  But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die (verse 17).” Instead of encouraging them to eat of the tree and help you all out?<br>
<br>
And to say there is not punishment being doled out here???<br>
<br>
“The serpent is condemned and punished for what he has done:  <br>
And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou [art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life (verse 14):  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed  and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel (verse 15).<br>
<br>
Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee (verse 16). “<br>
Seems submission is part of the punishment along with pains of childbirth!!<br>
And for Adam for listening to his wife, “And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed [is] the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life (verse 17);  Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field (verse 1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ;  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken (verse 19). “<br>
<br>
Oh yeah—and even though they are supposedly created in god’s image, they are all of a sudden ashamed the instant they become aware of their nakedness! Why be ashamed of this anymore than being ashamed of the trees, birds, plants in their natural form? <br>

I have never really known the WHY on the commandment not to eat the tree.  But in discussing this with my dh, I believe that I have had an a-hah! moment<br>
<br>
This is my opinion and not specifically doctrine from anything I have read.  But I believe that the commandment to not eat, had to be given for the world to fall and introduce sin into the world.  In other words, by taking of the tree of knowledge, they committed sin by disobeying God's commandment which intorduced sin into the world.  Sinning or disobedience allowed the world to fall from grace and became the world where we could come and gain the experience that we are now getting.<br>

<br>
<br>
11 For it must needs be, that there is an opposition• in all things. If not so, my first-born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.<br>
<br>
12 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose• in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God.<br>
<br>
13 And if ye shall say there is no• law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there• is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away.<br>
<br>
14 And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be acted• upon.<br>
<br>
15 And to bring about his eternal purposes• in the end of man, after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls• of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden• fruit• in opposition to the tree• of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter.<br>
<br>
16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act• for himself. Wherefore, man could not act• for himself save it should be that he was enticed• by the one or the other.<br>

<br>
As far as the 'punishments go, I believe that they fall along the lines of learning by experiencing hardship and having to work to accomplish anything.  (like mIsty's example of labour, difficulty and pain knowing that on the other end was a sweet little baby.  The difficulty helps us appreciate the beauty of that new little life.)<br>
<br>
As far as submission, we believe that we should listen to our husbands as they listen to the Lord.  If they are not listening to the Lord - being snotty, bossy, demanding, or all around chauvanistic, so long -- listening.  This isnt a license for men to domineer or mistreat their wives.<br>
<br>
I think the point about realizing they were naked and wanting to cover up was to illstrate that the innocence was gone.  Like little kids who run around nude and don;t have any clue that it is socially appropriate to cover up in public.  As we mature and reach the age of understanding we realize that covering up our bodies is appropriate in public.  Not that the body is anything to be ashamed of, but that it is sacred and special and to be modest is to save that for the person with whom you commit your life and share that intimacy.<br>

If not so, my first-born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad.”<br>
<br>
Why? Who made this rule? <br>
<br>
“And if ye shall say there is no• law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there• is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away”<br>
<br>
A more perfect example of the logical fallacy of circular reasoning could not be found! This is silly and ridiculous. There can be no happiness without misery for if there were not these things then there would be no God because if there’s no god “we are not, neither the earth”…uh…okay…I got less nauseating from spinning around on the teacups at Disneyland last month!<br>
<br>
“As far as the 'punishments go, I believe that they fall along the lines of learning by experiencing hardship and having to work to accomplish anything. (like mIsty's example of labour, difficulty and pain knowing that on the other end was a sweet little baby. The difficulty helps us appreciate the beauty of that new little life.)”<br>
<br>
If this were necessary to appreciate the beauty of life and move to the next level, god should have created it this way in the beginning, not wait for his children to drink the poison he created, left out and drew attention to then punish them eternally…KWIM?<br>
<br>
”As far as submission, we believe that we should listen to our husbands as they listen to the Lord. If they are not listening to the Lord - being snotty, bossy, demanding, or all around chauvanistic, so long -- listening. This isnt a license for men to domineer or mistreat their wives.”<br>
<br>
As I have said before, an enlightened despot is still a despot. Submission is the punishment for Eve for what she did…if her “master” is a nice guy, she’s still a slave. <br>
<br>
”I think the point about realizing they were naked and wanting to cover up was to illstrate that the innocence was gone. Like little kids who run around nude and don;t have any clue that it is socially appropriate to cover up in public.”<br>
<br>
But how could this have been inappropriate in public in the Garden of Eden? Why then do so many Aboriginals still go nude or partially nude? Should they be ashamed? Didn’t god tell them they are dirty and evil (even though in his image) and need to put a leaf on?<br>
<br>
“Not that the body is anything to be ashamed of, but that it is sacred and special and to be modest is to save that for the person with whom you commit…”<br>
<br>
Only in this country in this century and how does going nude or partially nude equate with “not saving yourself” or being less sacred. This shameful attitude toward the human body is part of why I feel sorry for xians. What a terrible legacy for your children to feel their bodies are sinful and that natural things are dirty...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have yet to find a logical or compelling argument, but am glad you feel you are learning more--even about your own faith as we talk. It is very important to you to justify your faith and find reasons why HF did this or that, not wanting to see faults in him, but I still contend we will not agree as I am being objective in looking at his actions (not assuming he is all-knowing or all-loving ahead of time) so we will likely always reach different conclusions.<br>

<br>
LDS do NOT feel that our bodies are sinful.  We dont feel that babies are born in sin.  We believe that any child who dies before the age of accountibility and other innocents (like maybe my son with CP) are automatically given salvation in that they did not/could not commit sin.<br>
