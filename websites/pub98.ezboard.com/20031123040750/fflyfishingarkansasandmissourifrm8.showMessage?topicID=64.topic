<br>
There are the &quot;usual&quot; fish there. I think that Saturday the fishing was off due to the weather and the fact that they ran water that morning. Those fish will often be off immediately after they run water. If the water has been down for a period of hours they will come back. There has been so much pressure at the dam lately that those fish have gotten to where they won't take a fly anymore. There were like 30 fishermen packed in those holes. There were a couple of guys that would follow where ever I put a fisherman and fish immediately beside them. I'm starting to get to the point that I'm going to quit taking people to the dam to fish. It's starting to get really rude there at times.<br>

Fishing the C&amp;R area during the week is the way to go.  At least on the other parts of the river John most of the guides will give you space if they know you are trying to make a living.  <br>

We walked into Cow Shoal on the Little Red. As we walked past a couple of fishermen one of them pulled stakes and walked along with us to where we finally stopped to fish. It was late on a Friday afternoon and there were really no people on the shoal to speak of. The fact that he walked 500 yards just to stand in the middle of us and fish was a little unbelievable. I mean I know it's not our personal river but there is such a thing as personal space. I try to tell myself that people just don't really realize what they are doing. I personally believe it always pays to be friendly on the river. I just get irritated when someone takes advantage of our good nature. He obvoiusly knew it was not being very nice when he asked Juni if it was a guided trip. When she answered &quot;yes&quot; he didn't offer to move an inch.<br>

Now it's like high water or wind as far as I'm concerned. It's just part of the fishing experience. I had a bit of an attitude &quot;epiphany&quot; a couple of years ago. I was sight casting to a 40&quot; fish in one of the holes there at the dam. I was resting the fish because I had lined it on accident and I didn't want to spook it. While I was sitting there a guy walked right past me and waded through the hole. I saw the fish bolt down river at mach 2 and my shot at a fish I had been working on all day was ruined. <br>
<br>
I was about 2 seconds from a &quot;freak out&quot; when I realized that it was just a fish. It was a beautiful day and I was just sitting there listening to the river. I spent the rest of the afternoon watching everyone else catching fish. It was really pretty cool. From then on I try to keep things in perspective. I'm not as concerned about &quot;My little patch of dirt&quot; as I used to be.<br>
