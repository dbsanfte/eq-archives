We will not rest in peace till we get back all our territory.<br>
<br>
In the year 1962:<br>
<br>
India never expected that China would attack. Attack where? At the places Indians were already PRESENT, and Chinese ATTACKED. So the battlefield was Indian held territory. There is no doubt the aggressor was China, and the territory lost was Indian. It was Chinese treachery and Back-Stab in the guise of &quot;Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai&quot;<br>
<br>
The Indian forces were hardly about 250,000, neglected after independence (1947), ill-equipped, thought as unwanted and an economic liability of the Newly Independent State of India which was in the mental state of Euphoric Hallucination of Peace and Disarmament, a myth of Indian polity.<br>
<br>
Appointment of the Generals was politicized, and those who had no war experience were entrusted with the war.<br>
<br>
Indian Air Force was conspicuous by its absence.<br>
<br>
In spite of all this, the actual forces, which were involved in the military debacle, were just about a Division plus.<br>
<br>
The will to fight Chinese to the end was absent in POLITICAL LEADERSHIP.<br>
<br>
Look at what happened in 1967:<br>
<br>
India just learnt a few lessons, Air Arm was upgraded, and the a war was just fought and won with Pukistan (1965). Around this time an incident had occurred at “Nathu-la” pass on Sikkim (India/China border). It resulted in an Artillery dual and the Chinese were so badly thrashed (as a localized battle) that there was a threat from the Chinese that they would use nuclear weapons. India was not a nuclear power by then, and the Indian political leadership lost the spine to continue and widen the local victory. The battle was a local victory. That added a lot of courage to the India psyche<br>
<br>
Now in 2003:<br>
<br>
The Indian Army +Reservists + Second Line of Defense is 2.5 million strong. Good number of these troops is well trained for the Mountain warfare, which essential is the kind of territory where war will be fought with Chinese.<br>
<br>
Indian Air Force, Strategic Forces (Missiles etc.) can take any Chinese city. And we have enough of them in numbers.<br>
<br>
No Indian, even the one of third generation after 1962 (I mean those who are in the Kindergarten now) would ever forget The Chinese Treachery calling “Hindi-Chini Bhai bhai”. The nation is ready with anger.<br>
<br>
The Chinese are now capitalists. The commy camaraderie is absent in the PLA. Capitalists will not take risks for the sake of honour, they will calculate loss and profit.<br>
<br>
All the pistols seized in Kashmir were Chinki made, all arms/missiles/aircraft that are aimed at India from Pukistan are Chinki made. China is already fighting a war with us through Pukis. So our aaanger, and determination to kick the Chinki a*rse is highly motivated and charged.<br>
<br>
Now is not the time to give the boot to Chinky a*rse, we will wait. Remember India is fighting with all kinds of enemies for decades, but we never capitulate or give up, we hang on to our aim till eternity, but will avenge.<br>
<br>
What we should do:<br>
First whatever cards China had opened, close them viz:<br>
<br>
1) Pukistan is an extended barrel of Chinese gun. Silence it forever with MILITARY MIGHT. We cannot avoid nuclear war with Pukistan; better fight it once for all. I am not a hawk. Just calculate the entire scenario, and guess whether Pukistan is ever going to leave us in peace. (Even after the settlement of the Kashmir issue) No, never. We can at best postpone the nuclear war to the verge of no further postponement. Better get away with it sooner than later, and WITH A FIRST AND TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE STRIKE. No stupid second strike theory, go for first strike, and with out announcing it.<br>
War with China would normally start with war on Pukistan. They are one and the same, two sides the evil coin.<br>
2) Teach Bangladesh a stern lesson. It should be kicked hard in such a manner that it should be scared even to look in the direction of China. In fact, the Bangladesh lesson should be completed first, even before we take up the final war with Pukistan.<br>
<br>
Next start playing our cards, viz:<br>
1)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rescind our recognition of Tibet as part of China. Go back and say, TIBET IS AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY BY ITSELF, AND RECOGNISE ITS GOVERNMENT IN EXILE. DEMAND COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE TO TIBET. Help Tibetan struggle for independence. The same way as we did in the case of Bangladesh.<br>
2) Recognise Taiwan as an Independent Country, receive its ambassador, and send our Ambassador to Taiwan.<br>
3) Try to have naval bases in Burma and Vietnam.<br>
4) Have strategic alliance with Japan and South Korea. <br>
5) When everything is ready, open up battle fronts in Laddak, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal, have a lightening campaign, and occupy territory claimed by us and a little extra to keep the tension alive.<br>
<br>
Before attempting to do all that:<br>
<br>
1) Reinforce the Indian spine with the toughest metal, preferably the kind used in the jet turbine blades.<br>
2) Have a heavy dose of testosterone injected.<br>
3) And have a gallon of whisky loaded into the stomach (preferable unadulterated with water).<br>
<br>
Then heat up the Iron toe of the India boot red hot, and give a kick on the <br>
Tender Chinki Bottom, that we will leave our brand there forever.<br>
<br>
No, we can never never be friends of China, till we get back all our territory, with honour. God willing we will do that, it may take ages, but we will avenge.<br>

Even their former brothers like the Pakis and Bangis are quick to dispell the truth that they were all part of one country and turn their laughing faces against the cradle of civilization that once beheld the most advanced civlization on earth. Indians have suffered very much, under foreigners, but more so under the British than anyone else. 200 years of slavery, colonzation, their people treated like subhumans, 200 years of toil and lashes under a British yoke, 200 years under the Gods who had failed thei peoples. And now, when the British have finally left India for good, the Indians have turned their blind hatred away from their white masters but onto their neighbors. They feel that every loss was a slap to the face and that the Gods have wronged their people, they feel that their race is superior to the others and that they must win! So, every vicotory, no matter how hollow or small, is boasted to a greater extent than ever conceived by the powers of mankind thorught the course of history. See their once kind and soft eyes fill with hatred as they view the flags of other nations, their their eyes fill with glee and fire when news came that Pakistan lost, see their gleaming teeth and hungry snarls as they counted the body parts taken from their unfotunate neighbors. Everyone last of them, them Indians, is determined, more determined than perhaps anyone else in the world, to gain what they see as the rightful place in the world, the role as a superpower, the role of a..............................................<br>
<br>
Conquerer.<br>
<br>
They want to rival the empires of Alexander the Great, the CHinese empire than had once sprawled across much of Eastern Asia, and the empire of Ghengis Khan.<br>
<br>
They will never stop, and their thirst of revenge can never be slaked. Their ambitions, while groundless, are unsatiable. Bordering on the impossible and the inhumane, they start their hate young, wjile still in their mother's wombs. Patroitic sounds, racial slurs, ethno-centrism and prayers of death vibrate into the unborn Child, filling him with a spirit of darkness which not even the divine light of the heavens can preferote. They start school, learning about their first glorious history, fillinf every child's heart with happiness and pride. Then it gets dark and the tone eventually blackens, as the list of foreign invasions come in. First the Aryans, then Iranians, the Macedoniansn then Mongols, then British and finally the economic invasion of China. Eventually the children grows up, and as the young hormones start filling his brain fanatism sets in. He knows not what bitter is, or what sweet is. He knows not what life is, or what death is. He has only one goal. Conquest.<br>
<br>
He studies, rempliring his brain with every technology he thinks is capable of destrution. Nuclear bombs? No. SOmething deadlier is desired. A hydrogen bomb? Maybe, still not powerful enough. Then what is desired. The answer: nothing short than a weapon that can kill billions at once but at the same time inflcitng great pain and torture for many years before the lethality sets in.<br>
<br>
He trains, famailiarizing himself with his assortment of rifles and dreaming each day to kill nhis enemies with dum-dum bullets. Dreaming about the grenades he will cast on hapless children, the bayonet which he will stick into the babies of his enemies. Dreaming, about, the bobdies of prehanat women and old folks that he will kick and run over with tanks...........<br>
<br>
The whole democratic nation has become a nation of 1 billion walking zombies, poised, thrist for blood. Each more deadly and terrible and hate-filled than the Huns, mongols etc. How can they be a deomcratic dountry u ask? Well, majority rules, and when 100% of them reach an unspoken consensus, they are truly democratic.<br>
<br>
Their world can only pray for their awaking. Or some years from now, the world will grow darken as their gigantic hordes ride down from the Himalays, blocking out the sun, and brandishing their weapons. Even the young, old and women would be among them, each taking an active role of killing, burning, raping everyone, everything, and every animal in their path. They rush like a torrent of steaming water, unstoppable. When one strikes down one thousand of then ten thousand rise to take their place.<br>
<br>
None would escape their wrath. No one. Not even themselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bindiachinaboard.showUserPublicProfile?gid=indianjawan47>IndianJAWAN47</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FF9300>(1/3/03 1:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/findiachinaboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/Images2/0461.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: India should win</span><hr size=1> Now that is demeaning.

I think I had hit IT right on its head, so it whipped up its hood, bares its fangs, venom fuming out like fire.<br>
<br>
 I am right. Next time when any Indian comes across a snake and a Chink, kill the chink first because it is more poisons and treacherous than the snake.<br>
<br>
As for Indian heritage and culture, no chink is qualified to talk about it (except far saying &quot;Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai, and stab in the back of noble Indian). We know what is our heritage, just to remind the dullards, Budha was born here.<br>
<br>
As for devastating the Chinks, through the fury that was narrared above by the blue snake, I only say &quot;AMEN&quot;. iT WILL BE DONE SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE,FOR SURE, AND I HOPE IT TO BE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bindiachinaboard.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goldendragon4>GoldenDragon4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF9300>(1/3/03 5:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/findiachinaboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> What the heck?</span><hr size=1> Indians: You all suck $$hit!

Just because you say that India has a bad army doesn't mean it has a bad army. Just because you say we are a nation of farmers, doesn't mean that we don't produce the best engineers in the world.<br>
<br>
Why do you assume that Indians are so violent, so barbaric as to resemble the chinese! Speak for yourself. For millenia, India has been an intellectual and economic leader of the world before the treacherous muslims entered the area. Just because India now is asserting her independence does not mean that she will use new power unjustly. Hinduism, by it's nature, is the most peaceful religion in the world, and you will be hard pressed to make Indians ignore it. Patriotic? Yes.<br>
Proud? Of course.<br>
But violent and barbaric? No, Islam provides the world with enough of that, and Indians have experienced war for too many centuries to allow them to get caught up in the fervor. Yes, they may have a large entanglement with Pakistan or China, but it will be for the best. India will not rape your women, drain your cities, or starve your people. She will be just as compassionate and tolerant as she ever has.<br>

I would have to pick China in a land fight.  <br>
<br>
I think that China has a slight edge in the air, but that might be close to parity.<br>
<br>
And India has the advantage at sea.<br>

<br>
If the Himalayas weren't in the way, I would pick China for a general land battle. The Chinese have the edge in manpower, tanks and other land assets. India probably has about a 6:5 edge in air power quality (though I think the Chinese have the edge in numbers).  From what I just read about India's MiG-29s, India may not have such a big edge in the air after all...<br>
<br>
I was looking at one of those International Aviation Defense surveys (It's one of those $20 paper back books in the history section of most book stores...), and it said that the Indian MiG-29s were having a hard time with maintenance, etc. The picture that accompanied it didn't look that impressive either. Still, I saw them live in Pune on my last trip to India (they share the runway with the commercial airport) and they looked great.<br>
<br>
At sea, India has the edge in a conventional war.<br>
China has a huge edge in any kind of nuclear war, but I'm not counting that here.<br>
IMHO, overall, China stomps India in an EastFront type war...<br>

Remember, we are dealing with the Pukis separately having wone some peace with the Chinkies. Now once we settle with the Pukis, we can deal with the Chinkies, till an opportunity opens up, the hostlity with the chinkies will be just hibernating in the cold storage, it will not be wiped out.<br>
<br>
Where has our courage gone when we were ready to fught both the Chinkies and Pukies simultaneously in 1971????. I will tell U a secret, I had crossed into the Chinky land in 1971 and we were ready to take their back had they wagged their tail. It would have been an unpredictable war with unpredictable outcome had the Chinkies joined the war along with the Pukies in 1971. Yet we were bold enough to be ready for the double eventuality. Compared to that day we are better off now, but where that courage had gone????<br>
<br>
Do U know what kept the Chinkies at bay, inspite of assured setback for India, inspite of our relatively smaller Army/Air Force????<br>
<br>
Our sheer determination to take them on simultaneously, come what may, and fight to the end. The Chinkies knew it, and kept away.<br>
<br>
If we start talking about the size, numbers and strength of their missiles in Tibet, we would loose the war even before a battle is started. The national honour is at stake, and volunteer professional army is itching to avenge, what objection do the strategists have???. We are ofcourse calculative, and will wait for the iron to be red hot (I have explained earlier to build up favourable conditions), and then strike it hard.
