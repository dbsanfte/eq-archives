<br>
~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe lay back on the uncomfortable bed in her doctor’s office and placed her feet in the stirrups as instructed.  When she woke up a couple of days ago from what she thought was a very vivid dream about her and Lex being married, she noticed that she had pain between her legs and she was bleeding.  She made an appointment with her doctor and explained the situation, and now she was about to go through the exam that would change her life – she just didn’t know it yet.  She heard her doctor make a knowing noise and push his chair away from the bed.<br>
<br>
“You know what’s wrong?”  Chloe asked hopefully.  The older man nodded and smiled gently before standing up and folding his arms across his chest.<br>
<br>
“You could have mentioned that you’ve become sexually active, Chloe.  It’s not at all unusual for a woman to bleed after her first time,” he said.  Chloe’s eyes grew wide.<br>
<br>
“What?  No.  I’m not – I mean – I haven’t – I ---”<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry.  It’s all confidential,” the doctor said.  “Your dad doesn’t need to know.”<br>
<br>
“But, I ---” Chloe trailed off as she remembered how real it had all seemed at the time.  Then her mind flitted to the strange little man that had been floating in Cole’s living room and all of the weird things that she heard happened to her friends as well.  The baby in what she thought was a dream called the stuffed dragon Mxyzptlk, which sounded like what the man had called himself.  Was it actually possible that she and Lex had been together?  She inwardly frowned.  Even if she told him, there was a very real possibility that Lex would just think she was crazy, so she decided against that option.  But she felt the driving need to talk to *somebody* about what was going on – and it wasn’t going to be her doctor, because he would have her committed for a psych evaluation in a heartbeat.<br>
<br>
Definitely not Pete.  He had been there when Mr. Mxyzptlk had appeared, but she was pretty sure he was passing off the experience to meteor fumes or something since he hadn’t spoken of it since.  Plus, she could almost picture him going to borrow Mr. Kent’s rifle for the occasion – even if she told him it was just a dream.  There was Clark.  He was there too, and he was the one who backed up Lana’s story about the so-called genie turning into the small floating man.  On the other hand, if she told him what happened, she risked him thinking that she was nuts or losing whatever little chance she might have with him, so that was out too.  <br>
<br>
There was Lana.  She had her own horrible experience with Mr. Mxyzptlk, so certainly she would be able to empathize with Chloe.  But, she would have to be prepared to tell Lana the truth and not omit any details about who her husband had been and that the idea wasn’t entirely repulsive to her; in fact, it had seemed right.  She finally resigned herself to nodding absently at her doctor.  If all else failed, she could always call the teen hotline they had set up at school and just leave out details.  <br>
<br>
“Have you thought about it?”  The doctor asked, bringing Chloe back to the realization that he had been talking all that time and she hadn’t heard a word he said.  She stared at him with what he interpreted to be an overwhelmed expression on her face and he smiled compassionately.  “Okay, look.  I’ll give you some pamphlets to take home.  They basically describe the pros and cons of the different kinds of birth control.  Just read over them and let me know what you decide, alright?”<br>
<br>
An hour later, Chloe was sipping her coffee alone at a corner table in the Talon.  They weren’t busy, but Lana was taking up most of Clark’s attention and vice versa.  Mr. Mxyzptlk, observing invisibly, noticed this as well and was a bit confused.  He thought that Clark liked Chloe and that was the entire reason for hooking Chloe and Lex up in the first place; just to torment Clark.  <br>
<br>
‘Maybe he just hasn’t made up his mind yet,’ he thought to himself.  An evil smile crept across his lips.  ‘But I can help with that.’  With that, Mr. Mxyzptlk popped himself out of the coffee shop.<br>
<br>
‘It doesn’t matter,’ Chloe thought, forcing herself to look away from the couple at the counter.  ‘I wouldn’t know where to start anyway.’  She didn’t notice Lucas come into the building, get his coffee, and then come striding over to her until he took the seat across from her and flashed her an almost hypnotic smile.<br>
<br>
“Hey beautiful,” he greeted.  She stared at him over the rim of her cup.  Normally flattery was nice, even if it was coming from someone who had pickup lines down to a polished art form, but not today.  Today she had too many other things occupying her mind to put up with this crap.  <br>
<br>
“That’s the second time you’ve called me that.  I *do* have a name, you know?”  She bit.  Lucas didn’t seem at all fazed by the comment.  Instead, he nodded his head and leaned back leisurely in his chair.<br>
<br>
“I know, *Chloe*.  But, you only ever hang out with dumb and dumber – well, and pretty prissy princess over there,” he said.  Chloe raised her eyebrows in amusement.<br>
<br>
“You make her sound like a ‘My Little Pony’ figurine.”<br>
<br>
“She’s not?”  Lucas joked.  Despite her best effort not to laugh, she let out a little chuckle.  “The point is, I don’t think any one of them has enough brain cells to appreciate you,” he said in a mock honest tone.  Chloe gave him a wince of a smile and sipped at her coffee.  <br>
<br>
Even though she was sitting in the corner, Sheriff Neil Matthews noticed Chloe when he first came into the Talon.  He didn’t know why, but for some reason he had been stricken with the irresistible urge to get coffee and he made his way down to the coffee shop right away.  He frowned when he saw Lucas saunter across the room and sit at her table.  He thought she had more common sense than to hang out with Lionel Luthor’s youngest son, who had quite the criminal record from what he had been able to gather.  Most of it had been covered up by the boy’s evil father, but there were still rumors and the occasional misplaced piece of paperwork that turned up.  Of course, Chloe was best friends with Clark Kent too, and that boy seemed to show up at every possible crime scene there was in Smallville.<br>
<br>
“Hello, Sheriff,” Lana greeted with a smile.  “What can I get for you today?”<br>
<br>
“Black coffee to go,” he answered somewhat gruffly, his eyes still fixed in a disapproving glare toward Chloe’s table.  Clark followed his line of sight and groaned.<br>
<br>
“Dang,” Clark said under his breath.  “I thought Lex warned him to stay away from Chloe.”  He was talking more to himself than to anyone else, but Matthews overheard him.  He couldn’t say that he liked the Kent boy all that much, but he didn’t exactly have any evidence against him either.  The closest thing he had were the pictures that Chloe took, which showed a blurred image in several shots.  Unfortunately, the lab hadn’t been able to clear it up much, so Matthews was forced to accept defeat for the time being.<br>
<br>
“Maybe he needs a reminder,” the sheriff said casually.  Clark looked at him in surprise.  Sheriff Matthews hadn’t been all that friendly toward him since taking over the position – but he had gone out of his way to be nice to Chloe.  Clark’s surprised look changed into a suspicious glare.  Matthews was probably only being nice to Chloe to learn his secret and if he wasn’t --- Clark inwardly shook his head, not even wanting to think about it.  The guy had to be in his late twenties; he was way too old for Chloe.  Clark started to stand up, but Matthews held out his hand to push him back down.  “Let me.”  His eyes darted toward Lana, where she was helping a customer at the other side of the counter, and then back to Clark.  “It will seem less personal that way.”  Clark looked at him pensively.  On one hand, he didn’t want Matthews to get any ideas about going after his friend; on the other, he had obviously noticed the ongoing triangle between him, Chloe, and Lana – and if he let the sheriff go over to warn Lucas off then the job would still get done without Lana getting mad at him.<br>
<br>
“Thanks,” Clark finally said, still not entirely convinced of the purity behind the sheriff’s motives.<br>
<br>
Matthews gave him a curt nod and Clark watched as he started walking over to Chloe’s table.  <br>
<br>
“Okay, here you ---” Lana trailed off when she saw that the sheriff was no longer standing there talking to Clark.  She followed Clark’s gaze over to where Matthews was now talking to Lucas and Chloe and then she leaned her elbows onto the counter so she could speak to Clark in a hushed voice.  “What do you think *that’s* about?  Is Lucas in trouble or something?”<br>
<br>
“Or something,” Clark responded, matching her volume.  He focused his super hearing on the conversation so he could listen in.  <br>
<br>
‘Ooh!  Fun, fun!’  Mr. Mxyzptlk thought to himself as he leaned back in the air, everyone in the room oblivious to his presence.  <br>
<br>
“They were *all* blurred?”  Chloe asked.  Matthews shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Not all of them; and they weren’t blurry, but there was a smudge or something on some of them.”<br>
<br>
“Weird,” she said under her breath.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah, weird,” Lucas said shortly and then gave the sheriff a fake smile.  “Is that all?  Because you know, *Chloe* and I were having a nice little conversation.”  Chloe arched an eyebrow at him.  Lucas felt threatened by Neil Matthews?<br>
<br>
‘Could my life get any more bizarre?’  She thought.  “No we weren’t,” she said.  Lucas smiled and her and tilted his head to the side.<br>
<br>
“But it was getting there,” he said.  Chloe was about to tell him that it wasn’t, when Matthews decided to speak up.<br>
<br>
“I’m sure that Miss Sullivan has better things to do with her time than to ---”<br>
<br>
Lucas scoffed and then shook his head at the man.<br>
<br>
“*Miss Sullivan*.  Geez!  You sound like my brother,” Lucas said.  Chloe started coughing on the drink she had just tried to swallow and cleared her throat a couple of times until she was completely better.<br>
<br>
“Are you okay?”  Both guys asked at once.  Chloe placed a fake smile on her lips.<br>
<br>
“Fine, it just went down wrong,” she lied.  What was she going to tell them?  That Lucas even casually mentioning Lex in conversation brought back an image of the two of them together?<br>
<br>
Clark snickered.  Neither one of those guys had a chance with Chloe; he didn’t know why he had been so concerned about it.  He noticed Lana giving him a strange look and realized that he must have made the sound out loud.  <br>
<br>
“What?”  He asked, hoping that she would fall for his ‘innocent’ face.  Lana narrowed her eyes at him and then shook her head a little. <br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” she said.  “You just --- well, it wasn’t really a laugh, but ---” She trailed off as the bell on the door sounded and she saw Lex walk in.  She gave him a small smile as he walked over.  “Hi Lex.”  Clark turned around a little on his stool and smiled at his friend.<br>
<br>
“Hey Lex.”<br>
<br>
Lex nodded once at both of them.<br>
<br>
“Clark, Lana,” he said.  “I don’t suppose either one of you has seen ---” Lex paused as his eyes scanned the establishment and he caught his brother sitting with Chloe.  “Lucas.”  His brother’s name came out as a small growl and Clark and Lana exchanged a surprised expression.  Lex squared his jaw and started to walk over to the table.<br>
<br>
“Well, that settles it,” Lana said.  “Lucas is *definitely* in trouble.”  She crinkled up her nose and looked at Clark.  “I wonder what he did?”<br>
<br>

<br>
‘It’s okay,’ she tried to tell herself.  ‘It’s not like he remembers anything – hey, it’s not like there’s anything to remember because it was probably just a dream and I’m overreacting,’ she inwardly rambled.  ‘Oh yeah?’ the little voice in her head spoke up, ‘then why were you bleeding?’  She forced herself to focus when Lex reached their table.  She noticed that his eyes were fixed on Lucas in a cold, warning glare; and although she probably should have felt sorry for Lucas, all she could feel was relief for herself.<br>
<br>
“Hey Lex,” Lucas said in a smug tone and a teasing grin on his lips.  It hadn’t been long since Lex had told him that he didn’t have a chance with Chloe, and ever since then Lucas had a strong suspicion that Lex had some sort of feelings for the girl – even if he hadn’t admitted them to himself yet.  When he heard Lex calling out Chloe’s name in what he assumed was a masturbatory passion, it only served to solidify his theory.<br>
<br>
“What are you doing here?”  Lex asked, holding in his temper only because the sheriff was standing next to the table as well.  Lucas held up his coffee cup and wiggled it back and forth as much as he could without spilling any of the hot liquid.  Lex frowned.  “You’re here for coffee?  You expect me to believe that?”<br>
<br>
“You can believe anything you’d like,” Lucas said with a shrug.  <br>
<br>
Sheriff Matthews and Chloe shared a look.  Lex was obviously angry with Lucas about something and Lucas was apparently goading him on.  Both of them were smart enough to know better than to get in the middle of a Luthor war.  As Lex and Lucas kept their eyes fixed on each other, the sheriff motioned for Chloe to get up.<br>
<br>
‘Ye-ah,’ Chloe thought, ‘because that wouldn’t look like I was trying to run away at all.  Geez.  What is it with the stupid guys in this town?’  Her eyes darted around the room and she smiled brightly when she saw Pete walk in the front door.  ‘Thank you, God!’<br>
<br>
“Okay, well,” Chloe said as she quickly pushed her chair away from the table, “see you guys later.”  Lex turned his head when she spoke and opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out.  What could he say to her in front of his brother and the local sheriff without sounding like he was crazy?<br>
<br>
‘Hey – you remember a couple of days ago when my imaginary friend made us think we were married with a baby?  Yeah, *that* would go over well,’ Lex thought sarcastically.  Chloe pushed her way past her nerves and flashed a small grin at Lex before turning to leave.  ‘Shit.  She doesn’t remember at all.’<br>
<br>
Matthews shot a warning glare at Lucas and then he headed back to the counter to retrieve his now lukewarm coffee.  He was pleased to see Chloe rush over to Pete Ross and practically pull him out the door even though he had just come in.  At least she had friends to help her get out of whatever Lucas was trying to pursue with her.<br>
<br>
“Way to scare her off,” Lucas complained, snapping Lex out of whatever thoughts he was having while staring at the Talon’s front door.  Lex turned his attention back to his brother and squared his jaw before sitting down.<br>
<br>
“Pete just showed up; she would have left anyway,” Lex said with a calm he didn’t feel.  “Why was the sheriff over here?  Are you in trouble?”  Lucas shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Not that I know of,” he answered.  Lex tilted his head slightly to the side, weighing whether or not he believed him and Lucas rolled his eyes.  “He was over here for the same reason you were.”<br>
<br>
“I sincerely doubt that.”<br>
<br>
“You came over here to warn me away from her, right?”  Lucas asked snidely.  Lex barely resisted the urge to knock over the table between them and strangle him, but Lucas could see his nostrils flare with the comment and he smirked at the reaction he got.  If he knew one thing about his brother, it was that he didn’t like competition, and it was a much more strategic play on Lucas’s part to get Lex jealous of the sheriff rather than him.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“Pete, you have incredible timing,” Chloe said as she looped her arm through his.  Pete looked down at the contact and then back up to her.<br>
<br>
“Are you okay, Chloe?” <br>
<br>
“I’m fine – okay, well, I’m not fine,” she said and gave her head a light shake, “but that’s not the point.”<br>
<br>
“What *is* the point?”<br>
<br>
“The point is that you have incredible timing,” she said and stopped as they reached her car.<br>
<br>
“Not that I don’t love a compliment, but I have a feeling this doesn’t have anything to do with me,” he said, giving her a questioning look.  Chloe sighed and tilted her head to the side.<br>
<br>
“Sorry,” she said.  “I had some bad news from my doctor today ---”<br>
<br>
“Are you still sick?”  Pete cut her off and took a wary step away from her.  Chloe chuckled at his reaction and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“No, I’m feeling better – but thanks for your concern.”  She said the last part pointedly and Pete gave her light smile.<br>
<br>
“Sorry Chlo, I just can’t afford to get sick with our game this Saturday,” he said.  A look of understanding dawned on Chloe’s face.<br>
<br>
“So, *that’s* why you haven’t been around,” she mused aloud.  Pete frowned and shoved his hands into his pockets.<br>
<br>
“Yeah.  Coach is pushing everybody pretty hard.  He’s even put us on curfew,” he said.  Chloe let out a small laugh and Pete’s frown faded into a grin.  “So, why do I have incredible timing?”<br>
<br>
“Oh yeah, that,” Chloe said, almost forgetting their original topic of conversation – or at least she was hoping to.  “Lex’s brother just kind of helped himself to sitting at my table and it was just kind of uncomfortable.”  She decided not to tell him about the rest of what was on her mind, knowing that he wouldn’t react well at all.  The expression on Pete’s face grew serious and even a little threatening.  Chloe wasn’t watching his hands or she would have noticed them clenching into fists.<br>
<br>
“Was he hitting on you?”<br>
<br>
“Not really – well, sort of I guess.”  Chloe paused and shook her head.  “No, not really.  I think that’s just how he is.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll kill him,” Pete said under his breath.  Chloe chuckled, thinking that he was joking.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think that’s necessary, Pete,” she said.  “And how would you make the game on Saturday if you were locked up?”<br>
<br>
“My mom is a judge,” he said.  “There’s no way I would still be in jail by Saturday.”  That only made Chloe laugh harder and Pete smiled because of it.  “Besides, I don’t think I would even be arrested.  I’ve seen the looks that new sheriff has been giving you,” he said teasingly.  Chloe stopped laughing and looked at him in confusion.<br>
<br>
“What are you talking about?”<br>
<br>
“Oh, please.  Like you haven’t noticed?”  Pete’s eyebrows rose when he saw the completely clueless expression on Chloe’s face.  “Dang, girl.  I know you have a crush on Clark, but you need to start opening up your eyes.  There are lots of guys right in front of you who you’re completely ignoring.”<br>
<br>
Chloe felt a pang of guilt as she remembered when Pete was under the influence of the Nicodemus flower.  He hadn’t shown any signs about being interested in her since then, but she couldn’t help but wonder if he was talking about himself.  She decided to make light of the situation before it got too uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
“Who?  Like Lucas?  I think I’ll pass, thanks,” she said.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah, speaking of him – he must have been pretty bad for you to practically push me out of there as an excuse.”<br>
<br>
“He really wasn’t,” she said and shook her head.  “But no matter how many times he calls me *beautiful*, I’m not going to start liking him; and in the mood I’m in today --- it was really more annoying than anything.”  She glanced down at her watch and then gave Pete a small smile.  “I’ve gotta get going.  Talk to you later?”<br>
<br>
“Yeah,” Pete said with a forced smile, “call me.”  She nodded and Pete watched her as she drove off.  He let the corners of his mouth fall into a menacing scowl.  “I can’t believe he was hitting on her.  Who the hell does he think he is?”  <br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk had watched the entire scene in and outside the Talon play out with a strange fascination.  Neither Chloe nor Lex had told anyone what had happened to them – not even each other – even though they both strongly suspected that it hadn’t been a dream.  <br>
<br>
‘How am I supposed to upset Clark with the information if no one *gives* him the information?’  He thought to himself.  An almost evil grin curled his lips upward.  ‘Ooh.  I know.’<br>
<br>
Pete went back inside the Talon and gave a small smile to the sheriff who was just now on his way out after waiting for Lana to get him a new cup of coffee.  He glanced around the room and his eyes narrowed when he saw Lucas and Lex talking over coffee at one of the back corner tables.  Normally he would have just ignored them, but for some reason, he felt an overwhelming surge of protectiveness flow through his body.  <br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk looked on invisibly as Pete crossed the room and glared angrily at Lucas.  He snapped his fingers and leaned back in the air as he watched his scheme go into action.<br>
<br>
“You,” Pete said, pointing a finger at Lucas, “you stay the hell away from her!”<br>
<br>
Clark and Lana shared a confused expression as they saw Pete come in, but instead of greeting them, he headed directly over to Lex and Lucas and started yelling.  Lana leaned toward him.<br>
<br>
“Maybe you should go over and play peacekeeper,” she suggested.  Clark nodded.<br>
<br>
“Good idea.”<br>
<br>
Lucas arched an eyebrow at Pete and Lex leaned over the table toward him.<br>
<br>
“He’s talking about Chloe,” he said in a hushed voice.  Lucas rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“I *know* that.  I’m not an idiot, Lex.”<br>
<br>
“The validity of that statement remains to be proven,” Lex said.  Lucas gave him a tight grin and looked back at Pete.<br>
<br>
“What are you getting mad at me for?  I’m not the one who was jacking off while thinking about her,” he said, his brother’s eyes growing wide as the statement poured from his mouth.  Pete’s anger seethed and his hands clamped onto Lucas’s shirt.  With what seemed to be super-human strength, he picked the younger Luthor up and threw him against the wall.  <br>
<br>
Clark didn’t realize what was happening until too late and he rushed over to Lucas’s unconscious form.  There was some blood coming from the back of his head, but he was still breathing.  He looked over at Lana and she took his non-verbal signal to call an ambulance.  Pete just stood there in shock, amazed by what had just happened.<br>
<br>
“Pete?”  Clark asked.  The sound of Clark’s voice just barely registered in Pete’s head.  Instead, Pete turned to look at Lex, who seemed just as stunned as he was.<br>
<br>
“What did he mean by the ‘jacking off’ comment?”<br>
<br>

Story #4: Where’s Pete When You Need Him? – Chapter 3<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lex looked at his brother and then back at Pete.<br>
<br>
“How did you do that?” he asked suspiciously.  <br>
<br>
“You answer my question, I answer yours,” Pete said.<br>
<br>
Lex ignored him and went to check on his brother.  Sure, Clark had already checked on him and there was an ambulance en route, but checking on Lucas had the dual benefit of making him not look like an uncaring asshole in front of the other patrons of the Talon and allowing him to dodge Pete’s question at the same time.  Momentarily anyway.<br>
<br>
“Lucas?”  Lex shook his brother’s shoulder a little bit, but Lucas didn’t respond.  Lex wasn’t concerned.  Lucas was still breathing and his heart rate was still good, he was just unconscious and a little bit bloody.  Pete started to stalk over to him, but Clark held him back, shooting him a questioning look with his eyes.<br>
<br>
“What’s going on with you?” Clark whispered, his gaze darting to the Luthors on the floor and then back to Pete.  Pete tilted his head toward Clark.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” he admitted in a hushed voice.  “I just got so angry.  I’ve never felt anything like that before, Clark.”  Clark frowned at his friend.  “And then, the next thing you know ---” he trailed off and shook his head as he looked at Lucas.  “Do you think this has something to do with the ‘you-know-what’?”<br>
<br>
“Maybe,” Clark said, sounding unconvinced.  “But do you think it can do that?”  Pete shrugged.<br>
<br>
“It cured your mom,” he pointed out.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah, but ---” Clark stopped whispering when the ambulance and a police car pulled up outside the Talon.  <br>
<br>
Sheriff Matthews came in first and his eyebrows rose when he saw the unconscious bleeding form of Lucas on the floor.  The paramedics came in and started to take his vital signs as the sheriff began to ask questions. <br>
<br>
“Why am I not surprised to see you here?” he asked Clark.  Clark shoved his hands in his pockets and gave him his best ‘I’m innocent’ look.  <br>
<br>
“Because I’ve been here for the last hour?”  Clark offered.  Matthews scowled at him and then made his way over to where Lex was watching his brother being examined.<br>
<br>
“You want to tell me what happened?” the sheriff asked.  <br>
<br>
“Mr. Ross came over to our table to tell Lucas to stay away from Chloe; Lucas made an inappropriate comment; Mr. Ross lost his temper,” Lex summarized.  Matthews looked over at Pete and motioned for him to come over.  <br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk watched on, disguised as one of the paramedics.  He blinked once and Pete’s boiling anger and super-strength that he had temporarily given him were taken away.  Pete walked over to the sheriff and gave him a guilty look.<br>
<br>
“*You* did this?” Matthews asked.  Pete’s shoulders sunk.<br>
<br>
“Yes, sir,” he said.  <br>
<br>
“How?”<br>
<br>
“I – I don’t know,” he said and shook his head a little.  “It just sort of --- happened.”  Matthews looked questioningly at Pete.<br>
<br>
“What did he say to set you off?”<br>
<br>
“He was hitting on Chloe,” Pete said in a defensive tone.<br>
<br>
“And?”<br>
<br>
“And then,” Pete paused and ducked his head, “then he said something about Lex – you know – while thinking about her – and ---”  <br>
<br>
Lex was suddenly overwhelmed with feelings from when Mr. Mxyzptlk made him and Chloe believe they were married.<br>
<br>
“I wasn’t jacking off and what I do with Chloe is none of your ---” Lex interrupted, only to stop himself when he realized what he had just said, and who he said it to.  Sheriff Matthews and Pete both narrowed their eyes at him.<br>
<br>
“What did you say?” Matthews asked in low growl fraught with suspicion.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah,” Pete chimed in.  “News flash Luthor – Chloe would never go out with you.”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk grinned mischievously as he helped lift Lucas onto the stretcher.  He was a little surprised that Lex hadn’t recognized him yet, since he went to all the trouble of looking like he did when he was Lex’s ‘imaginary friend’, but he would get a good look at him soon enough.<br>
<br>
“Excuse us,” he said as he walked backward, carrying his end of the stretcher.  Lex and the sheriff moved to the sides but Lex grabbed the man’s arm as soon as he recognized him, almost causing them to drop Lucas.  <br>
<br>
“You!”  Lex yelled.  Clark’s eyebrows rose and he leaned his head to the side.  He didn’t recognize the man, but Lex obviously did.  “You took her away from me!”<br>
<br>
“She wasn’t yours to begin with,” Mr. Mxyzptlk said in a taunting voice.  Lex snarled at him and he started laughing.  Clark recognized the laugh and finally put the pieces together.  He stepped toward Mr. Mxyzptlk and stared him down.<br>
<br>
“What did you do?” he asked accusingly.  Mr. Mxyzptlk smiled giddily.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know what you mean,” he answered.  Clark reached out and grabbed him by the jacket, to which Mr. Mxyzptlk responded by changing back into his true form and floating out of Clark’s grasp.  The sheriff’s mouth dropped open and it looked like his eyes were about to pop out of his head.  The other paramedic let go of his end of the stretcher, but Lucas body stayed horizontal as it hovered in mid-air.<br>
<br>
“What the hell?” Matthews asked.  Mr. Mxyzptlk waved his hand and everyone in the Talon froze except for him, Clark, and Lex.  <br>
<br>
“What did you do?” Clark repeated.<br>
<br>
“I froze them,” Mr. Mxyzptlk said.<br>
<br>
“I can *see* that,” Clark said.  “I mean ---”<br>
<br>
“I want her back,” Lex interrupted, completely unfazed by Mr. Mxyzptlk’s normal appearance, or the fact that the imp could bend all rules of physics in the universe to suit his whim.  Clark and Mr. Mxyzptlk turned to face him.<br>
<br>
“You never had her,” Mr. Mxyzptlk reminded him, but then tilted his head to the side.  “Well, okay, you *had* her, but - it was just one of my fun little games.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t care,” Lex said in almost a growl.  “I want my life back.”  Clark observed the two of them with a great deal of confusion.<br>
<br>
“What are you talking about?”<br>
<br>
Mr. Mxyzptlk smiled proudly.<br>
<br>
“I made them think that they were married,” he answered.  Clark was almost afraid to ask, but only because he had a strong suspicion as to what the answer would be.<br>
<br>
“Who?” he asked hesitantly.<br>
<br>
“Me and Chloe,” Lex answered for the little man.  Mr. Mxyzptlk nodded in agreement.  <br>
<br>
“Why?” Clark asked.<br>
<br>
“Because ---”<br>
<br>
“I don’t care why,” Lex interrupted again, “but I’ll pay you whatever you want to get her back.”  A look of complete shock crossed Clark’s face and Mr. Mxyzptlk just seemed amused.<br>
<br>
“Lex, I don’t think ---”<br>
<br>
“I don’t need your money,” Mr. Mxyzptlk cut off Clark and sloughed off Lex’s proposal with a wave of his hand.<br>
<br>
“What *do* you need?” Lex asked.  Mr. Mxyzptlk was surprised.  He should have expected a counter offer from Clark’s future nemesis, but for some reason he hadn’t, and it intrigued him.  He waved his hand again as Clark was starting to protest what Lex had just said and Clark froze.  <br>
<br>
“Interesting,” Mr. Mxyzptlk mused aloud.  Lex was about to say something when Mr. Mxyzptlk snapped his fingers and everyone in the place fell to the floor or slumped down in their chairs, including Lex.  The ambulance and other paramedic disappeared, as did the stretcher underneath Lucas.  The blood on the wall disappeared and Lucas’s head wound healed.  Then, Mr. Mxyzptlk added a final touch of making the room smell like natural gas.  With a blink of his eyes, he vanished.<br>
<br>
Clark awoke around the same time as the others, with his head pounding and coughing into his t-shirt as he held it up to his nose and mouth.  All of the patrons made it outside and Lana shook her head lightly as she wove through them to get to Clark and Pete.  <br>
<br>
“I can’t believe we had a gas leak,” she said as she got up to him.  “I hope everyone’s going to be alright.”<br>
<br>
“I’m sure they will be,” Clark said reassuringly.  The sheriff came over and gave Lana a quick nod of his head as a greeting.<br>
<br>
“We’re going to have to shut you down for a few days until they can find the source of the leak and contain it,” he said.  Lana nodded.<br>
<br>
“Of course,” she agreed.  Matthews looked suspiciously at Clark before leaving and Lana furrowed her brow.  “What was that about?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” Clark lied.  “He just doesn’t seem to like me for some reason.”<br>
<br>
Lex and Lucas walked over to where the group of teenagers had gathered and just like them, or most of them anyway, they didn’t remember what had happened either.  <br>
<br>
“Lex, I’m so sorry.  I don’t know how this could have happened,” Lana said.<br>
<br>
“I’m sure it wasn’t your fault, Lana,” Lex said.  Lucas rolled his eyes as much as he could before the throbbing pain in his head stopped him.  <br>
<br>
“Of course not,” he said somewhat sarcastically, only reigning in the full force of his quip because too many of her friends were surrounding her.  He made a face and then looked at Clark.  “Hey, I didn’t see ---” He was about to say that he didn’t see Chloe leave and ask if she was alright when he saw her talking to the sheriff and trailed off.  “Never mind, I see her,” he said with a smile.  <br>
<br>
Pete shook his head as he watched Lucas cross through the crowd to get to Chloe.  <br>
<br>
“You think he even realizes that he doesn’t have a shot with her?” Pete asked.  Clark looked over at Lex to gauge his reaction, and frowned when he saw Lex squaring his jaw.  Pete turned back around and gave Clark and Lana a small smile.  “Well, I gotta go guys.  Talk to you later.”  Lex barely acknowledged the fact that Pete walked off before trying to head in Lucas and Chloe’s direction.  Clark stopped him and smiled at Lana.<br>
<br>
“Lana – isn’t that the health inspector?”<br>
<br>
Lana’s head whipped around and she wrinkled her nose.<br>
<br>
“Ooh,” she muttered under her breath.  “Wish me luck.”<br>
<br>
Lex turned to look at Clark almost angrily, but Clark glanced at Chloe and then back to his friend.<br>
<br>
“She doesn’t remember, Lex,” Clark said.  Lex looked at him questioningly and Clark sighed and gave him a sad, almost pitying look.  “She doesn’t remember.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
