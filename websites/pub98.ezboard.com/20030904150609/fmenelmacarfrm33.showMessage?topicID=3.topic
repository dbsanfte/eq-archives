<br>
Johann Izarnsmittt laid on his side piecing together his sniper rifle.  He had hidden it in his buisness suite by tapeing it to his chest.  He was a very good size man so it was not conspicious.  Johann already had his ear plugs in, we was prepared.  He removed his swade leather sandal and twisted the sole of the shoe out fell four rounds.<br>
<br>
He laid back on to his back taking a deep breath.  The sun glared down on him forcing him to squint.  He casually removed his watch and rings placing them inside his right coat pocket.   Johann hated Boris Kournikova it was only a matter of time before it came to this.  Johann would have hired someone but he was an expert, and this was personal.<br>
<br>
Johann rolled on to his stomach.  He got in a crouched defensive posture and looked over the edge.  Boris was sitting at a small circular table inside Tsess Forevetizess Cafe Boris sipped a drink of some sort from a small glass. Boris Kournikova was alone and the plaza outside the Tsess Forevetizess Cafe was almost empty.  The stray person scurried from shop to shop getting their lunch.<br>
<br>
Johann was hungry it was after all lunch time.  When this is over he thought he thought.  He looked down once again pulled his rifle to him hugging it tightly.  Johann kissed each bullet.  &quot;Time to put him to rest.&quot; He manually loaded one round.<br>
<br>
A scope wasn't necessary the plaza was only a hundred meters away.  Johann brought the weapon and found his site picture.  He inhaled and could hear his heart beat loudly, boom, boom like small munitions. He exhaled again his heart beat loudly in his ear he could hear nothing out.  In that pause between breaths he slowly squeezed his trigger.<br>
<br>
It was like a thunderous crack it shocked him.  Firing the rifle always suprised him as he was in a deep calm as he did.  The feeling rang through his body.  He quickly looked in the direction he had fired.  <br>

<br>
Boris Kournikova sat sipping tea at the Tsess Forevetizess Cafe.  He ate lunch here every day it was a ritual of his.  He enjoyed sitting next to the window, it wasn't that he liked looking out it though.  Boris just enjoyed being in places the people could see him.  They seemed to enjoy it too.<br>
<br>
His waitress took his order, he was going to just have a club sandwich.  He waited patiently sipping his drink.  It had been a long day he just flew in the night before from Menelmacar.<br>
<br>
He was currently acting as Prefect of Justice there even though he was also an important Crandish official.  He needed to slow down, life was young and all these jobs where getting to him. He still hadn't quite grasped how to juggle them all but he was working hard, and people could see that.<br>
<br>
His waitress returned setting a small place with the club sandwhich on his table.  Boris looked up and smiled at her.  &quot;Thank you.&quot; He met eye contact with her, he always did.  She always just smiled back and walked away, one of these days he'd have to get her name.  Maybe tomorrow he thought, he always thought maybe tomorrow.<br>
<br>
He picked up his cup and lifted it slowly to his lips.  He drank again finishing off the cup.  He lifted his hand to ask the Waitress for a refill.  Time froze and a loud noise was heard, he heard screams all around him.  Boris looked down to see his chest covered in red, that was the last thing he viewed before his vision faded. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.thebananamovement.tk" target="top">Jekh dilo kerel but dile hai but dile keren dilimata</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://collectiveunconscious.port5.com/Animations/Roma.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 3/11/03 10:45:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://collectiveunconscious.port5.com/Animations/Roma.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elenaran<br>

<br>
Robert Belci was staying in a Menelmacari Hotel.  He had flown in to vote and visit his brothers in Menelmacari.  He was the President of Cranda but maintained a citizenship here.  Belci enjoyed this nation it was diverse and always had a beautiful countryside. He stayed in Caras Menelmacar, he almost always stayed here.  <br>
<br>
Belci lay on his bed he was resting it had been a long day.  Lots of activity in Menelmacar he was considering getting a new house he tired of hotels.  He afterall spent more time here then anywhere else.  Sometimes he wished they had remote ballets so he wasn't forced to travel to the conclave so many times a week.<br>
<br>
His phone rang &quot;Yes?&quot; answered Belci.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You have a call, would you like me to transfer you?&quot; Asked the operator whom had a thick accent, he must of been from the south continent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes please.&quot; responded Belci in his equally thick Crandish accent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Belci the Govenor of Londina has been shot.  The doctors tried couldn't even try to save him, he bled to death before the paramedics arrived.&quot;<br>
<br>
Belci was angry all he could say to respond was &quot;Noted.&quot; He slammed down the phone in disgust.  He wanted revenge, Cranda would have its revenge.. but so would Menelmacar.  Boris was Menelmacar's Prefect of Justice.  He'd get them involved too. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.thebananamovement.tk" target="top">Jekh dilo kerel but dile hai but dile keren dilimata</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dilerrkarlsesson>Dilerr Karlsesson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Assistant Justice<br>

His friend and only Crandish ethnic brother in Menelmacar had been shot.  He had to be avenged but his intelligence agency was in a knot.  His intelligence agency simply had a name, Johann Izarnsmittt but besides a name nothing.<br>
<br>
He didn't really believe in Psychics, nobody really did not even psychics themselves.  However they had an uncanning ability to get shit done.  So he decided to contact Archetype whom had connections with psychics.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello how can I help you?&quot; Answered a receptionist obviouslly human.  It was the first time a human was receptionist in the Palace in Menelmacar since the nation's founding.  Before that Sirithil always hired her own.  <br>
<br>
&quot;This is Robert Belci I need Archy.&quot; Belci said casually, the receptionist was familiar with him by now. <br>
<br>
&quot;One moment Sir.&quot; Her sweet female voice said.  Archetype figured having a female receptionist was cliche, and he thought it was a good cliche seeing as it calmed most male visitors, which he had more of then woman.  The receptionist patched the call through to Archetype.<br>
<br>
&quot;Archetype, how can I help you brother Belci?&quot; He said in his casual voice.  Archetype never pretended, he was always himself, sometimes to the disgust of those around him, but he was always real.<br>
<br>
&quot;Boris has been killed, I want him avenged.&quot; Belci said his voice full of emotion, the emotion bled through the phone lines.  &quot;Johann Izarnsmittt killed him.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Archetypes demeanor changed some claimed he was psychic, however he always seemed to respond like most humans.  &quot;It'll be taken care of, Somemen brother.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Peace Archy.&quot; Belci replied as he hung up the phone.<br>
He laid back on his bed staring at the ceiling.  He was a president sure, some even called him fascist but he did care. <br>

<br>
Archetype and Path Follower an extremely efficient remote viewer, and deadly loyal Menelmacari, sat across from each other in the Palace Basement.  It was a thick wooden table and before pathfollower where several picture of a Johann Izarnsmittt.  &quot;Just look at them for a second brother.&quot; Archetype said softly breaking the silence for a moment.<br>
<br>
Pathfollower stared at the picture then pushed it aside.  &quot;Just give me numbers, you are going to give me analytical overlay.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Fine fine, One, Five, Seven, four, Dash, Three Six Seven, Five.&quot; Archetype knew the drill, he assigned those numbers to the location of Johann Izarnsmittt.  He then sat back quietly clearing his mind not to project any stray thoughts at Pathfollower.<br>
<br>
Pathfollower looked at the numbers he had written on a blank piece of paper in front of him.  He stared at them a moment, his pupils dilating as he watched them.  His pupils then flared open, and closed as his eyes slamned shut, and his mind was drawn from his location.<br>
<br>
His right hand clenched the pen next to him, his eyes again opened softly but with a distant look.  He began to scribble, and scribble.  His wrist work was quick and precise drawing, describing, and depicting the image inside his mind.<br>
<br>
He set down his pen &quot;That's it I started getting analyitcal overlay.&quot; He slid the piece of paper over to Archetype who looked it over.  He smirked knowing exactly where this was.  <br>
&quot;You know this guys brave, what the hell is he doing alone, in <br>
Menelmacar?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe he wants to kill Belci too?&quot; Pathfollower added.  It was obvious pathfollower was right, a man who had never stepped foot in Menelmacar, has just murdered our Prefect of Justice, and is now on our soil.<br>
<br>

<br>
Pathfollower stepped off the boat, and looked around casually.  This dock was the last place he had seen Johann Izarnsmittt but he was closer range now, he had no need for remote viewing.  He found a boat rental stand, and purchased a house boat for three days.  He doubted it would take him that long.<br>
<br>
He didn't bother untieing the boat from the dock, he examined the inside of the boat it was small but would do, he set his sword, and shield down inside the boat.  While they where ancient weapons, he used them masterfully.  Johann Izarnsmittt planned to wait in LIthfalas no doubt, Belci had a public appearance he was trying to rally support for the new Menelmacari language he was writing.  However Archetype told him to stay behind without publically canceling it.<br>
<br>
Instead they'd send the private Menelmacari boat that sent all state official from city to city so that Johann Izarnsmittt still believed his target would arive on time.  Pathfollower however had other plans for Johann.  He laid on the bed, he didn't eat, he waited for the night.<br>
<br>
As the sun set, and night overtook Lithfalas he began meditating, he relaxed and focused on Johann, it was like a whisper at first as Joahnn's thoughts slowly integrated into pathfollowers, until was like a room full of voices.  Johann was at a restraunt, he was eating.  Pathfollower listened more and slowly began the task of filtering out those around Johann.<br>
<br>
Soon it was all quiet, just Johann's thoughts they where like syrup running across Pathfollowers tongue as he swalloed the information, the thoughts where crazed.  &quot;He'll die, I'll kill him, He wont live, I'll kill him, I'll kill him.&quot;.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://collectiveunconscious.port5.com/Animations/Roma.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Scrolls<br>

He was going to go hunting.  He picked up his sword and sheath it.  He removed the old blanket from the bed, shook it up and wrapped it around him conceling his wepaon, and body stature.  He then left the boat, he looked like a homeless man now as he walked down the docks towards the food district.<br>
<br>
He stepped on to the roads, keeping close to the buildings as he walked.  His leather sandals made a soft noise against the damp stone.  The stone glistened slightly in the moon light it was a beautiful.  He only had to walk a mile before he was in the midst of the food courts.<br>
<br>
Mostly sea food, and custom cuisine of the traditionalist who lived in this area.  While it was night the streets where still busy with people walking back and forth.  It was interesting watching how busy they looked, not a care in the world. <br>
<br>
&quot;I need my receipt&quot; Johann's voice played in his head.  Pathfollower swung around looking all around him before reconizing it was the telepathic connection he formed in the boat.  He sat against a building and tuned in on it.<br>
<br>
He could hear Johann thinking, he was counting his money, he was paying for his meal he'd be leaving in seconds.  Pathfollower expanded the connection, removing some of the filters, and again the voices returned the noise of the room, the clanging of dishes, and people laughing, enjoying themselves.<br>
<br>
Johann was leaving now, as he opened the door to leave, a cople passed Johann and a waiter greeted them. &quot;Welcome to the the Home of the Sizzling sword fish!&quot;<br>
<br>
Pathfollower lurched to his feet, quickly filtering the line.  He had been there, that was the best swordfish in all of Menelmacar.  He began running pushing past people, holding the blanket tight around him. <br>
<br>
There he was, Johann was walking casually towards the parking lot on the other side of the food court.  Pathfollower stopped running and began walking catching his breath and keeping a distance.  Pathfollower shut off the link it was not needed now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://collectiveunconscious.port5.com/Animations/Roma.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Scrolls<br>

There where individuals scattered through out the rows in cars, coming and going.  This was one of the most active places in town at night another hour and it would be empty, as the patrons move on to the clubs thirty minutes away.<br>
<br>
Johann fished his rental keys out of his pocket.  He looked around him carefully he had grown paranoid lately.  He couldn't help it, ever since he killed Boris he couldn't help but fear his arrest.  Boris had friends but it was a risk he had to take.<br>
<br>
Johann was confident that Belci would go down just as easy.  Robert Belci was always over confident, rarely aware of his suroundings like Boris was.  This would be easier.  The thought of the rally made him sick.  The rally would be full of morons listening to Belci like he was decent politician.<br>
<br>
Johann knew better he was smarter then the people who listened to such nonsense.  Johann came back to his sense he had spaced out again, he looked around again, behind him was a bum walking towards him.  Johann had found his car and began to insert his key.<br>
<br>
&quot;Got some change sir?&quot; The bum spoke with a bit of an accent it.  It wasn't normal like most Menelmacari.  Who was this man who lost all his money on Menelmacari soil.  &quot;please sir, just a couple dollars.&quot; The bum said as he walked closer.<br>
<br>
&quot;No sorry I don't have any.&quot;  Johann lied he didn't care about a bum.  He had better uses for his money.  He opened his car door and slid in.  He watched the bum come closer.  &quot;I said I don't have any.&quot; Johann shouted and slamned the rental car door shut.  He thought of how uneducated bums where.  The bum was about 2 feet from his hood as Johann Started his engine.<br>
<br>
Johann did a headcheck while he put the automatic car into reverse.  Just then he heard a hissing sound from the front of his car.  He whipped his head back around to see and there was the bum infront of him with a sword hacking away the two front tires.<br>
<br>
&quot;You Should of given me some change.&quot; Pathfollower declared as his blanket fell to the ground exposing his regular clothing.  The blade reflected the moon light up it's curved edge.  Johann's blood went cold. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://collectiveunconscious.port5.com/Animations/Roma.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Scrolls<br>

In his mind he said fuck head checks and slamned on the gas the rear wheel drive propelled the car away from the bum with a sword.<br>
<br>
He quickly turned the wheel put the vehicle in drive and slamned on the gas pedal again, he barely gained speed, the man with the sword chased him.  Johann didn't slow down when he came to the street, he didn't look both ways either he flew out into the road barely dodging the cars.  He was now skating along the road his front two wheels sparking, and the back ones spinning visciously to keep the little moment he had.<br>
<br>
The man chasing him stopped at the edge of the parking lot.  He didn't watch where the man went from there, but he at least was spared for now.  Who was that man he thought, it had to be someone sent after him.  Nobody could of traced him here, he had used a fake name.  Now he'd have to be extra careful when assasinating Belci he thought.<br>
<br>
I must kill him though, he has to die Johann couldn't bare the thought of any Crandish officials living.  He snapped back to it and quickly remembered he needed to pull over and ditch the vehicle before a Menelmacari police pulled him over.<br>
<br>
He quickly swerved into a side parking lot.  He got out of the car, and picked up his black suit case from the back.  It held the only items he carried.  His shaving kit, a set of clothing, and his rifle and ammo.<br>
<br>
He popped the trunk and took out a crow bar.  He used it to pry the liscence plate loose, then popping the trunk scratched vigorously at the liscence numbers.  He then used the crow bar to smash the windows out.  He quickly let the tires out of the back two tires as fast as he could.  <br>
<br>
He then lifted his suitcase up again, and swiftly walked down the sidewalk.  Avoiding looking up and staring forward.  Each step he made his shoes dragged slightly.  He was still shaking and he over exerted his steps to prevent from tripping.  With each step he heard in his head kill him.<br>

He watched the trail of sparks fade into the distance.  He'd find Johann again.  He walked back through the parking lot picking up his blanket and wrapping it around his shoulder.  He returned to his rented house boat.  He'd find Johann it would just take a little longer then expected.<br>

He laid in his bed, and reached out focusing on Johann.  Again he connected it was quiet, then the sounds slowly entered cars racing by, and the sound of scuffing on the ground.  Johann's thoughts where not diverse &quot;kill him, kill him, kill him.&quot; It was in a scary rythm.  <br>

He got on the ground and prayed to the fnords who watched over him, and thanked the yellow one for it's protecting force that kept him safe through the night.  This was a ritual acted out by many psychotic men from the lands across the sea.<br>
<br>
He picked up his sword and laid it on the kitchen counter with his shield.  He made his bed neatly, folding the edges compulsively like he was still in training.  He opened the refridgerator it contained a complimentary sandwich, and a small mini bar.  He picked up to mini bottles of vodka and the sandwich and walked outside of the boat house.<br>
<br>
Sitting on the dock he ate the sandwich and drank the mini vodka's over looking the ocean.  It was beautiful he thought, not as beautiful of the waters around the island of radiance. He knew this wasn't a pleasure stay so quickly got up and tossed the empty bottles in the trash, and got himself a glass of water to finish it all down.<br>
<br>
He may have a rough day and he knew alcohol was a diaretic and he didn't want to be dehydrated.  With all the discipline he contained he could never pass up a good vodka.  He drank the water quickly and laid on the neatly made bed.  He was careful not to pull the creases out of shape.<br>

He turned and saw Pathfollower infront of his vehicle.  Pathfollower through his sword which broke through the glass the blade of it slicing his Johann's forhead<br>
<br>
Johann jerked awake, he had been dreaming.  He kept reliving the events of last night but each time he was killed instead of escaped.  He felt as if this was an omen of some kind, he had a pit in his stomach.  He reached for a glass of water but realized he wasn't in his hotel room.  Johann had entered a strangers house last night who had left the key under a potted plant by the front porch.<br>
<br>
The house was empty the occupants seemed nowhere to be found, their answering machine was full.  He was lucky he played the answering machien message and it revealed they wouldn't be back for another four days.  He was content he didn't have to struggle for the house, he'd of killed them if they where here.<br>
<br>
He didn't want to be found in a hotel, that was to obvious and he knew the bum wasn't really a bum, he imagined Belci sent him.  This wasn't Belci's style he thought, but this was all the more reasons to kill Belci when he arrived.  <br>
<br>
Getting up out of bed Johann searched the closet and found a nice suit.  He laid it on the bed and read the sizes, almost a perfect match.  He searched further for dress shoes but the ones he found where two sizes to big.  He'd have to purchase some.<br>
<br>
Johann showered, and ate their food leaving the dishes in the sink.  He didn't care, he had however closed all the windows, and blinds so nobody would see him.  This was just incase his neighbors knew the occupants well.<br>
<br>
He went back upstairs and tried on the suit.  It fit all but slightly loose around the waste and wrists, he transfered his belt from his pants so they wouldn't slip off while running.  It could use a bit more fitting he din't care though.  This would due.<br>
<br>
He felt an eerie presence about him, as if someone was watching him.  He kept shrugging it off, he had felt this last night briefly too.  His thoughts returned to Belci and his evil plans to kill him.  Belci must be killed, again he chanted in his head kill, kill, kill.
