Panic is in her sapphire eyes and she pants slightly as she runs, looking behind her every so often, only to run faster.  Her right leg is wounded, a deep gash slicing through her knee high boot and trailing blood on the ground; she limps slightly but runs with uninhibited fear.

&quot;Kill the elfling!&quot;  *she hears them yell*<br>
<br>
*She looks behind her and gasps, forcing her legs to go faster as her white hair shimmers in the sunlight like fast moving water.  Every so often she moves her fingers to her lips and whistles sharply, but soon gives up the act and just runs for her life, knowing that she cannot fight her pursuers alone.  Once again she falls and tries to rise, but a great pain shoots up her leg and she crawls along like a wounded animal before giving up, and crying out for someone, for ANYONE, to help her.* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kalirandone>Kali Randone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/7/03 8:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Great Escape</span><hr size=1> ::A tall, silent figure steps out from behind a tree.

<br>
Before Kyonae could reply, a wave of both pain and relief washed over her. She gave a short cry, and he let his hand fall away. Kyonae looked up at him in astonishment as he rose to his feet, gesturing toward her injured leg. She looked down and gasped, realizing that there was no trace of a wound to be seen. Kyonae looked up at him again, gently whispering, &quot;Thank you...&quot;<br>
<br>
The unknown healer opened his mouth to reply, but he was interrupted by a loud roar that broke through the silent Forest. He quickly turned to look in the direction of the sound, assuming that it was the 'behemoth'. Shifting his attention back to Kyonae, he stared into her sapphire eyes. &quot;Let's go.&quot; He said simply.<br>
<br>
Helping her to her feet, he gently grasped her arm. Kyonae reached for her sword and let him pull her away. They broke into a run as another roar pierced the forest air, weaving through the scattered trees. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/8/03 3:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Great Escape</span><hr size=1> &quot;Come! This way!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kyonae pulled her newfound friend along more than he led her, as she seemed to know where she was going.  Her leg still ached a bit, but it was much better than before thanks to the stranger, but in his act of healing they had lost precious time, and the soldiers and their beast were not far behind.  Already she could feel the trembling in the ground, and the panic of the shaking trees as they quivered about her and the tall man.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Raaaaagh!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The roar sounded behind them like a war horn, and the very sound alone stopped them dead in their tracks like dragonfear.  They turned to see the monstrous beast, covered in matted, colorless fur and two large horns that could spear young dragonskin.  It roared and it stomped on all fours, behind it its tamers, several soldiers clothed in white robes and bearing sabres.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kill the companion!  I want the elfling alive!&quot;  the leader ordered.<br>
<br>
Kyonae panted heavily from the ceaseless running, but stepped forward with adamance in her cerulean eyes.  &quot;You come for me.  Leave him out of this!&quot;  She drew her elven blade, which shone in the air, the object of purity irritating the beast of such unholiness.  She did not look strong enough to fight, but still she turned to her companion and cried, &quot;Run! This is my own fight!  I will hold them off on my own well enough.&quot;  a strange glitter filled the oval orbs of blue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kalirandone>Kali Randone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/8/03 3:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Great Escape</span><hr size=1> The stranger stared back at her, stubborn, and unsheathed his own sword. &quot;I refuse to leave you here alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kyonae noticed the sword that he held in both hands, her eyes widening slightly. It was huge, twice the size of her Talon. A small hint of a smile flashed across his face before they turned to their enemies, preparing to fight... together. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/8/03 6:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Great Escape</span><hr size=1> Kyonae pointed her sword at them and cried out &quot;Blizza!&quot; just as the behemoth raised up on its massive hind legs.   A large spear carved of ice conjured form the air before her hands, and hurtled through the air, plunging itself into the behemoth's shoulder.  It did little to stop the monster's rage, but it wounded him greatly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Pyre!&quot; <br>
&quot;Pyre!&quot;<br>
&quot;Pyre!&quot; <br>

The cry echoed across the battle line of the small group, their hands lighting up with flame.

The beast was on top of him, crushing him to the ground. blood came flowing warm on Zander's skin, and he shut his eyes tightly, waiting for death. But strangely...there was no pain.<br>
<br>
Because the blood was not his own.<br>
<br>
His sword, Broadsword (really creative name...) had plunged through the mighty beast's furry chest, and the beast impaled itself further on the blade, trying to get to his prey. And suddenly, in a writhing convulsion that sprayed even more blood onto the pale face of Zander, the behemoth slumped forward and to the side with a mighty thud, dead.<br>

Mirak...the name buried deep into her mind and burned itself into her brain, where it would stay until the end of her days.  Her wounded sword arm grabbed her sword and pointed it at him in threat, but the slender limb shook in pain, and she knew she hadn't even the strength to fight a child.  Still she held firm, daring the stranger named Mirak to even try to come closer, silent and cold as she always was.

&quot;A sword? A weapon crafted from this world can't harm me I am a void demon after all&quot; Mirak told the injured women with his usual cold toneless voice. Looking at the sword with all three eyes Mirak causing it to be flung to one side.<br>

&quot;You have nothing to fear from me, yet, I have no reason to kill you and you are no threat to me&quot; Mirak told the women. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A> at: 2/15/03 12:13:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/15/03 12:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whatching</span><hr size=1> Kyonae watched her sword being flung away, the pure elven blade tossed aside like a flimsy dagger.  She looked at him dangerously.  Already she felt a deep distrust, and a burning anger as she stared into the triple eyes that burned like fire.  Her companion Zander looked at them both, sword in hand, but did not move a muscle, more confused than threatened, it seemed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can see well that no physical weapon can harm you,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;You are strong.  But no matter my appearance, void demon, I am strong as well.&quot;  Her eyes gleamed with a strange placid coldness.  &quot;You need not fear me, lest I feel you place a threat upon me. Then may Glacia save you.  And I have no reason to kill you, either...which I could do very easily.&quot;  Her voice was like the chill of the northern winds.  &quot;And I am more of a threat to you than you realize, O Revered Being of the Void.&quot;  She was being very respectful, but it was cordial and wary. &quot;And what do we owe this unexpected visit?&quot; she asked lightly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/15/03 9:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whatching</span><hr size=1> &quot;You flatter me&quot; Mirak remarked looking at the injured women. &quot;So you believe yourself to be threat? I have lived longer then you could possible imagine, face opponents who could destroy whole worlds in a blink of an eye and won. So you say you can beat me,” Mirak said and as his upper eye locked onto the elven blade and made it slide back to Kyonae.<br>
“Now for the last part of your question, I was send here by my lord, Faro, to investigate this part of the world, for reasons I wise not to say. I have but merely stumbled upon your little miss adventure and I am curious about why they wised to kill you” Mirak once again looked into the woman’s face and saw the distrust in her eyes.<br>
“Or do you believe me to work along side the men who had attempted to kill you?”<br>

She saw the age of her home world Mahtim in his eyes.  She saw many things in his eyes, in his mind, that were not meant to be seen, but she did not dwell upon them.  &quot;I am not saying defeating you would be easy,&quot; she replied cooly.  &quot;Not at all.  But you would find me a rather difficult opponent.  I have crossed swords and magic with the most horrific beings of my world, those who have sought after much more appealing things than just a few worlds beyond.  I have not won, but I have never lost either.&quot; She looked back at the slain behemoth.  &quot;They were after me for more than the joy of hunting elven kin.  I have a bauble in my keeping of which their king has desired for many years.  It holds unimaginable power.  And I do not believe you to be in league with them...if you were, you would have killed me by now.  Such is the nature of Osirians.&quot;  Her hand went up to touch her shoulder wound, never wincing.  &quot;It is just a shame you must see me at my weakest.  I've escaped from their dungeon, and they came after me with one of their experiments.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A> at: 2/15/03 11:46:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cliffaro@collisionworld>Cliffaro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/15/03 11:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm147.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whatching</span><hr size=1> &quot;A bauble&quot; Mirak said and quickly looked over Kyonae trying to sense its power. &quot;What does this king want with it?

She clutched the falcon amulet about her neck, and used her mental strength to ward him away.  She was the guardian of it, after all. Maybe she was being cold and rude, but she found it hard to trust anyone anymore. &quot;This bauble is a key to all of those.  Would he have it, Dratilia, my homeland, would be laid to waste at his feet, his for the taking, he would have wealth beyond imagining, and power that even you, a Revered Being of the Void, have never dreamed of,&quot; she whispered.  Then she smiled, but it was bitter, and rueful, as if pondering on an irony.  &quot;Though, in truth, he wants all these things, but he could care less about the Falcon.  He desires it so he can exchange it to his mistress for the power, the wealth, the land.  To him, it is but a shiny token.  To his Mistress, something vital.  He does not why, nor does he care.  He himself had the pleasure of telling this to me.&quot;  Suddenly her eyes flickered with pain.  &quot;They could not take it off.  It is magically bound to me.  Only I can take it off willingly, or unless I am slain.  So they tortured me in their dungeons.  Once they turned their backs on me, I ran.&quot;  She looked at Mirak curiously.  &quot;But why would you be interested?  You are very powerful, I see.
