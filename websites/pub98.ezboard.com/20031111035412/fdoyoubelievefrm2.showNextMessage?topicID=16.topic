Love Himself</span><hr size=1> Dear board members,<br>
Before writing anything I would like to first say that I will refrain from posting any links in this post, but if anyone is interested in some of the links, that I will mention here, please visit the &quot;Links to other Christian sites&quot; section, I will post some links there.<br>
<br>
So I hope you don't mind if I share with you something very remarkable which I came upon, by Grace, a while back;  the peace and love messages of  &quot;True Life in God&quot;.  After reading all the messages, I sincerely, with all my heart, believe them to be true, Providential, Heavenly Works, a Love Hymn from -Love- Himself, our Eternal Father;  God.  A reminder of His Word through the Holy Spirit of Truth, revealing nothing new, and adding nothing new to Scriptures.  They are written for our times, and have opened my eyes, revealing what is -really- taking place in and around us.  Besides being written in a most beautiful way, the language used in the messages is simple to understand, familiar, and straight forward, yet embodies a profound depth, speaking directly to one's heart and soul.  The language of Divine Love.  With the help of the TLiG messages, I am learning to better understand Scriptures; in a more spiritual way.  They have strengthen my faith, brought me closer to God, and taught me how to better pray with the heart, and to pray without ceasing.  But most of all; I would like to express how much these messages brought me closer to Jesus (who <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Love Himself), by helping me to better understand and love Him more, with all my heart, all my soul, and all my strenth.<br>
<br>
The messages themselves are handwritten by Vassula Ryden.  Vassula is an Orthodox Christian, and God <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>dictates</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to Vassula (the poor instrument of God) the messages.  The handwriting itself is &quot;hieratic writing&quot; and is distinct from her own (called &quot;Sacred writing&quot;, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be confused with automatic writing).  One may see for themselves how the handwriting looks, on the Internet, and also read a detail explanation on the handwriting, and about the unique way in which she receives the messages.  These articles are also available on the Internet. (I will place the link in the Links section).<br>
<br>
Please don't get me wrong, I'm not attempting to proselytize anyone to some other denomination or religion, and I am definitely not here to force or convince anyone to accept the truths I believe in.  All I want to do is to share, with anyone that is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>willing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to listen, and to give witness to what I truly believe, without a doubt, to be a trustworthy, unique, and precious Spiritual Gift of God's Love.<br>
<br>
Here's a few tiny excerpts from the messages:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TLiG  October 2, 1989:<br>
&quot;Come and I shall show you, if you are willing, what <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>True Life in God </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">means. I tell you solemnly that anyone who lives in Love lives in Me, your God, and I live in him.&quot;</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
TLiG  February 6, 1992:<br>
&quot;Daughter, I give you My Peace . If anyone will ask you: &quot;what is this all about?&quot; (God means the messages) answer: Compassion and Love is revealing Himself to mankind; Salvation leans all the way from Heaven to reach the Wretched, supplicating them to renounce their folly. What God is saying to us today means, Peace, Reconciliation and Love.<br>
<br>
- Infinite Love -&quot;<br>
<br>
TLiG  August 10, 1994:<br>
&quot;Ah, My child, what will I not do for you? In the Tenderness of His Love, My Father covered your path with sapphires: a King, yet so motherly; a Judge, yet so tender and loving; the Alpha and the Omega, yet so meek.&quot;<br>
<br>
TLiG  March 8, 1988:<br>
&quot;My Return is now very near, Love will come back to you as Love and My Kingdom on earth will be as it is in Heaven, for Justice, Love and Peace will pour from Heaven upon you creation! &quot;<br>
<br>
TLiG  April 12, 1990:<br>
&quot;Love will be coming back to you as Love,  this is My Promise. So be prepared to receive Me and I shall give you the gift of My Love and the gift of My Holiness.&quot;<br>
<br>
TLiG  July 22, 1994:<br>
&quot;Love is on the Path of Return; the Day of the Lord is near, nearer than you think!  Repent! Repent and be glad - the trumpet of the sixth angel will soon be heard to fulfil the warnings of God. Hurry and repent to obtain the Lamb's Seal on your forehead.&quot;<br>
<br>
TLiG  January 28, 1995:<br>
&quot;Tell them: blessed is he who has ears to hear and eyes to see, theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven; tell them that the God they have forgotten has never forgotten them. I, Jesus Christ, bless each one of them. Those who welcomed you in My Name have already My blessings. Ic.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Also, what I found very interesting, and enlightening,  is an article called &quot;Recognizably Jewish&quot;.  It helped me to understand the &quot;unusual expressions&quot; that are found in the messages.  Some believe these are grammatically wrong, but they actually make up part of the richness of TLIG.  This study also shows that TLiG uses the &quot;correct Hebraic expressions&quot; as found in the original Jewish Bibles and literature.  (this link I will also place in the Links section)<br>
<br>
All the messages of True Life in God, besides being translated into 40 different languages, are also on the Internet, (I will place this link in the Links section) .  And at first, that is the way (via the website) how I myself came to know them.<br>
<br>
One important thing to remember is that the messages are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> just for her,  they are directed to all of us, no matter the creed, in fact Jesus asked Vassula to tell those reading the messages: &quot;to always take her name, Vassula, out of the messages and replace it with our name.&quot;<br>
<br>
If anyone has any questions, concerning the &quot;True Life in God&quot; messages, please don't hesitate to ask, I will try my best to answer any questions.<br>
<br>
May God Bless you and keep you.<br>
In The Resurrected Christ,<br>
Love<br>
jack <br>
<br>
P.S:  Again, I would like to testify; that I, jack michal, by the Grace of God, wholeheartedly believe these messages are Divine/Heavenly Works of Mercy.  In truth;  the Works of The Holy Spirit of Truth.<br>

This is wonderful that you shared this with us!<br>
It is refreshing to know of others doing His work for Him.<br>
This is what our book is about.  God came to us and asked us to do the same for Him.  <br>
The writing in our book(s) is what we call: inspirational writing, as it is coming from God.  It is not to be confused with automatic writing, as this can happen too, but usually is associated with people's spirits who have passed on, but not necessarily God.  Sometimes automatic writing has been known to come from other sources that we will not mention here, as we do not like to give any energy thinking about the other sources.  <br>
Inspirational writing, however, is writing that is &quot;inspired&quot; being of God.  You will see many similarities in our books with what Vassula has received.  <br>
God told us we would be hearing of others doing similar work for Him, and it is so exciting to hear this news!<br>
<br>
Thank you again for sharing this beautiful information with the board.  Hopefully others will receive this information with open minds and hearts, and truly understand that God has not stopped communicating with His people in this way!<br>
<br>
Thank you for coming here and please visit often. It sounds like we have a lot we can talk about!<br>
<br>
God Bless you!<br>

I thank you for your very kind welcome!  And I also thank you for being so open in mind and in heart,  I believe this is rare, at least in our times, where love and spirituality are missing in many hearts.<br>
<br>
I also hope you don't mind if I share with you and others the links I mentioned in my first post:<br>
<br>
All the messages from 1986-2002 are online @:<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.tlig.org/msg/messl.html" target="top">www.tlig.org/msg/messl.html</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
And here's a picture of the special writing in which the messages are written (click the picture to have a closer look), and also some info about the handwriting:<br>

Oh, and an article &quot;Recognizably Jewish&quot; I mentioned above:<br>
