Um.... I'm almost done with The Two Towers!! And I'm halfway through with Water Sky. It's actually turned out pretty intresting. I like it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I went to ZAP again yesterday. It was AWESOME!!!!!! I cannot explain how much the sermon touched me yesterday. I have never felt so close to God before. I felt like Christy in Until Tomorrow when she felt God breathing on her. That's how I felt. The sermon was about marriage and purity and it was a couple form ZAP that's getting married in two weeks. Their first kiss will be on the alter in two weeks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Isn't that amazing?? That kind of comitment just amazes me. They reminded me a lot like Doug and Tracy. They're so cute together. And then at the end they had a time for people to come up and pray with them if you needed to give something up to God and needed prayer. It was astounding to see people I had talked casually an hour before up there on their knees pouring their pleas and prayers out to God. It was so cool. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy/biggrina.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm so glad I'm going to ZAP now. <br>
  I'm going to see Lord of The Rings Wednesday!!! Woohoo!!! I'm soo excited. I'm going with my cousins who are as crazy about it as I am. We are going to have so much fun!!! And it's only two bucks to get into the theatre so that's a blessing. I can't wait. <br>
     Hre's the lyrics to a worship song we sang last night. I only know the chorus though.<br>

Let's see a lot has been going on. I went to the pool with Megan Tuesday. It was sooo fun. There was this lifeguard and he looked like Eligah Wood. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy/biggrina.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He was really cute but not as cute as the lifeguard down at my pool. His name is Tom. Natty and Katherine, he looks exactly like Hayden Christianson if ya want to come on down!!! Megan told me Monday she met Jesse Pratt. Ughh. She told me he was pretty chatty with her, I have no idea why he is ignoring me. I just want to be his friend for crying out loud!! Tomorrow is Father's day. I feel really bad for my dad cause we can't get him a present this year. Our money is just too tight. I didn't end up seeing Lord of The Rings Wednesday, I'm seeing it this coming Wednesday. I don't want to even go into that story but at least I'm still seeing it. <br>
  Books...<br>
I started the Glenbrooke series and it si awesome!! So far Secrets is a great book and Kyle is sooooo sweet and cute. <br>
Water Sky- I'm almost finished with this book, I've got two chapters left and actually it has been a very intresting book. It's kinda sad but still pretty good. <br>
LOTR-The Two towers-Well let's see, this book is my weekend reading book and I still ahven't gotten very far. I've got like six chapters left I believe. Oh well I'll try to finish it by next week.<br>

I found this awesome website where you can get Lord of The Rings pictures and it has pictures from The Two Towers!! They are soo cool. Legolas is still by far my fave, he is soo cute!! I made a poster today with my little sister and cousin for my room. We printed sixteen of those pictures off the internet and glued them on a big poster.

Journey to Jo'burg- This is the new school book I'm reading. It's started out pretty good. I like it. I especially like the short chapters.

Song of the day-<br>
Start to fly<br>
Plus One<br>
You've had your taste<br>
of all that's sweet<br>
now you're through and what does it mean?<br>
you've sought the truth<br>
found a lie<br>
you've given up but it<br>
doesn't make it right<br>
you want to go<br>
I know you want to leave<br>
gotta to go <br>
farther than you see<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
If you just look past your scars<br>
you will see<br>
it's not that far<br>
don't close your mind<br>
let God inside<br>
begin to breathe<br>
start to fly<br>
<br>
Wake from your sleep<br>
start your dream<br>
it's okay to believe<br>
what you don't see<br>
give it away<br>
your heart won't break<br>
this is a chance you're gonna have <br>
to take<br>
you want to go<br>
I know you wanna leave<br>
gotta go farther than you see<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
If you just look<br>
past your scars <br>
you will see<br>
it's not that far<br>
don't close your mind<br>
let God inside<br>
begin to breathe<br>
start to fly<br>
<br>
Just close your eyes<br>
hold on tight<br>
you don't have to be afraid, He<br>
is with you all the time<br>
You'll be free, full of peace<br>
everything that you need, <br>
it is right here can't you see?<br>

A lot has happened this past week and a half. I went to Lord of The Rings last Wedensday and it was so awesome!!! But I can definetly wait until it comes out on video to see it again. I started dance camp Monday and oh my gosh I am soooooo sore!! My thighs, my calfs, my shoulders, my arms and my neck all hurt. When I'm not in public I hobble around the house like an old lady. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy/biggrina.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Hee hee. It's been a really good learning experience and fun though. I'm really learning  lot more about modern dance and when Stacy teaches class I really do get a lot out of it. The only stinky part is you ahve to make up your own dance and I hate that. but this year we get to put the dance to music instead of it just being silent. So that's cool. I'm babysitting with Megan tonight. We're babysitting her little brothers and baby sister, and then I'm just spending the night at her house, AND THEN I have to go to a meeting for Kids of Victory tomorrow morning. I'm going to be helping out being a leader at this vacation Bible school thing this summer. Megan was going to do it with me but she didn't get signed up in time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/shakehead.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Hopefully I'll see Nick. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :crush --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/love/loveya.gif ALT=":crush"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And then my mom is picking up me and Megan at her house after the meeting and we're taking Megan to basketball practice and then she's coming over to my house to spend the night tomorrow night. Then Sunday we're going swimming at my pool and then we're both going to Zap(my youth group.) It'll be Megan's first time. Then we're dropping Megan off at home and I ahve to go to dance again the next day. Whew! I have a busy life. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy/biggrina.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Ha ha. <br>
Books-<br>
Journey To Jo'Burg- That was my next school book and I've already finished it. It was very good, it was a little depressing though.<br>
The Wolves of Willoghby Chase- This was the next one and I'm about halfway through with it. It's really good. it has a lot of adventure and humor and the old English way of speaking is lovely to read.<br>
The two Towers- I finished it! Woohoo!!!!! Yep, I did it. Early Wednesday evening and I immediatly started Return of The King. The Two Towers was great, I really enjoyed it. The humor in this book was awesome. This book definetly had some comedic relief. Legolas and Gimli are sooo funny! It ended on a cliffhanger that is sure to leave the audience breathless when they see the movie if you haven't read the book. Thankfully I won't have that problem.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
SPOILER-DON'T READ UNLESS YOU'VE READ THE BOOK, or you're just curious. Ha ha.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I can't wait to see how the directors will make the battle between Shelob and Sam look. Shelob is sure to be gruesome and nasty. I'm sure I'm gonna cry when Sam thinks Frodo is dead. I almost cried just reading the book. The relationship between Frodo and Sam in this book is just totally amazing. It just blew me away how faithful and unbelieveingly loyal Sam is to Frodo. It's just so sweet. Sigh. I also can't wait to see how the movie portrays Gollum. It'll be intresting to see him on  screen, his voice I'm sure will be increidbly sannoying but I think he's kinda cute. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy/biggrina.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Even though he betrays *****!!!<br>
But anyway theis book was one of the best I've ever read. It took me a while to get through it and there are parts where you just have to plough through but I'd recommend this to anyone. <br>
Return Of the King- I haven't read that much in this. (Haven't had time.) But so far it's been really intresting, I'm only on the middle of the second chapter. I'm at the part where Merry swears his service and loyalty to King Theoden. *GG* <br>

I didn't expect to get payed Friday but Megan's parents gave me and Megan twenty five dollars. I told them they didn't ahve to but they did anyway and then I appreciated it because I need the money. And wow! ZAP last night, well let's just say it's one of those awesome, incredible spiritual experiences you'll never forget. Everybody from ZAP,(except me and a few others) just got back from YFN. Youth For The Nations. And they were all talking last night on how every year after YFN everybody feels this spiritual high and then after a dew weeks they're low again. One girl said at this point in her life she's not ready to drop the ball this year and she's not going to. It was so awesome. And then Worship began and everybody was just so excited to give their all. The first song they sang was new and it was called Ou Generation and it was basically just a song that was saying exactly what the girl was saying. I am the first to admit that I used to be not a worship type person and the first two times I went there I didn't really sing and I was emberessed to thinking everybody was watchign and then last night I thought &quot;Everybody else here doesn't care hwat other people think. They just care what God thinks. That's what I want to do too.&quot; And then form them out I just worshipped with my all. And it was SUCH a freedom to do that, I felt God's presence like never before while I worshipped him. But another thing that happened was while I was worshipping I noticed Jesse looking at me a lot. And I just thought what in the world? He hadn't spoken to me for the two times I had been there, why was he looking at me now? And what do you know, after worship he came over and talked to me. I couldn't believe it! He came over and held up his hand for a high five and I high fived him. It was pretty funny. Oh man! I have to go! I'll finish this later!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/umytodd1126.showPublicProfile?language=EN>myTodd1126</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/lb/lb_3.gif> I'm the love doctor!</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/2/02 11:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Amie's Journal!!</span><hr size=1> I don't feel like finishing that story now but at least you know he talked to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That's all I really wanted to say. Dance has been really good again this week. I'm learning a lot and having fun doing it. I'm excited that I'm getting more parts in the dances than last year. I'm sooo happy. Me and Emily are having a blast. (Emily is my friend from dance.) Well at least i'm having a blast seeing Emily having it out with Stacy. Emily just gets a little bit frusturated with her. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm gonna be so busy again this week. Tomorrow I have my dance recital thingy summer camp thingy, and then after that tomorrow I hvae to go home and go to my cousin's birthday. I'll be there all day and I'll spend the night there. And then actually Thursday I don't think I'm that busy. But then friday my youth group class that has me and six other girls are going to one of the girls house to swim and have food. Ha ha. It's a little social thing for us girls. Then Saturday my youth group and that includes the boys are all going on this scavenger hunt all over the city. It's gonna be awesome. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :sk8er --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/glcklch/glcklch_102.gif ALT=":sk8er"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Then Sunday of course I have ZAP. I'm looking forward to everything. I got this awesome cd yesterday at One Way. It's Rebecca St. James new Worship God cd. There are some awesome worship songs on here. I reccomend this to anyone. I especially love Breathe, Let My Words Be Few, Above All, Song of Love and Better is One Day. She has such a beautiful voice and she puts a new twist on thsese beautiful worship songs. <br>

Wolves of Willoboughy Chase- I'm farther into this and it's still intresting. I like it. It's funny and I just LOVE The Old English way of speaking. <br>
Return of The King- *SPOILER- DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU WANT TO*<br>

I just read the chapter about The Paths of the Dead. It was sooo cool. I personally think Eowyn is a bit of a whiner. She kept whining to Aragorn. Doesn't she know he's in love with Arwen? But yes I do know she finds somebody else and falls in love with *******!!!! I'm just at the part where they rode past the Paths of The Dead and now Merry is almost to Edoras where The Grey Company just passed by the day before. I can't wait to get farther into this and return to Sam and Frodo. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Secrets of New Babylon- This is the next book of the Kids Left Behind Series, it was a story builder if you know what I mean. Not a lot of things happened. Bu it was good. <br>
Escape form New Babylon- *SPOILER*<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Auughh! A lot of twists happened in this book. Man! One of the saddest things that happened though was that Pavel died. I cried. It was a very peaceful death though. He knew he was going home. Sigh... I think one of the best things though that happened was that Judd got some sense knocked into him!!! He started to have doubts about his relationship with Nada. Yay! And his thoughts turned often to Vicki. Yay! Oh and the other awesome thing that us fans have been waiting for is that Charlie beame a christian!! I was sooo happy. So well anyway Judd kind of broke up with Nada. And Vicki found out he had been dating Nada and she got kind of upset and finally admitted to herself that she had strong feelings for Judd. Oh and I think Shelly likes Mark! Man this is turning into a soap opera. Well that's all I think. These two were a lo better than the previous ones and I can't wait now until the next two. it's getting closer to The Glorious Appearing in thsese books. <br>

    Better is One Day<br>
How lovely is your <br>
dwelling place<br>
Oh, Lord Almighty<br>
For my soul longs and even faints for You<br>
For here my heart is satisfied<br>
Within Your presence<br>
I sing beneath the shadow of your wings<br>
      CHORUS<br>
'Cause better is one day <br>
in your courts<br>
Better is one day in your house<br>
Better is one day in your courts<br>
Than thousands elsewhere<br>
<br>
One thing I ask and I would seek<br>
To see Your beauty<br>
To find You in the place <br>
Your glory dwells<br>
<br>
    CHORUS<br>
Better is one day <br>
in Your courts<br>
Better is one day in Your house<br>
Better is one day in Your courts<br>
Than thousands elsewhere<br>
<br>
My heart and flesh cry out to You,<br>
the living God<br>
Your Spirit's water to my soul<br>
I've tasted and I've seen<br>
Come once again to me<br>
I will draw near to You<br>

I've read through the first half of this book and it has been AMAZING!! The battle in Gondor was described increidbly and It left me breathless. I really love some of the new charectars coming in. I absolutely adore Faramir!! He's so different from Booromir. Booromir was strong and proud and stern and not really in the least bit gentle though he was kind. Now Faramir on the other hand is exactly the opposite. He's incredibly gentle, kind, selfless and thinks more of others then himself. He didn't want to take the ring like Booromir did at first. And even though he was let down and put down by his own father who said he loved Booromir more he went out and fought bravely still for his father and for his city. The Return of Aragorn is amazing. I love the pasrt where the riddle says in the hands of the king there is healing and then behold! Aragorn comes and heals everybody. It's so awesome. I've read the part where they've rode to Mordor to fight Sauron and his forces and The Mouth Of Sauron comes out and shows them Sam's sword and Frodo's cloak. It scared me for a minute but I read on. I thought the way Gandalf addressed the Mouth of Sauron was soooooo cool. Gandalf rocks man!!! I read how Pippin slays the beast and then lacks out but before he does he hears somebody far off on the mountain top crying The Eagles are coming!! The eagles are coming!! And since I've read The Hobbit I know that was once before said by Bilvo but I think I know who is saying it now. *Grins slyly* Okay but anyway I've passed all that. Where I actually am now is where Sam has rescued Frodo and they are making their way toward Mount Doom. Oooooo. I almost cried at the so sincere love Sam had for Frodo that he just pushed on until he found him. Sam is soo sweet. the interaction between these two best friends is AMAZING!! I am soo into this book!! Well that's all I ahve to say untill I get further along. *grins*<br>

Out of the depths of my despair<br>
Oh I cry Father hear my voice<br>

Oh Father who'd be standing?<br>
But in Your goodness<br>
there is mercy and forgiveness<br>

Except for maybe Kim,(She's sixteen and probably old enough to date, I think.) but I don't think she thinks she's ready for a relationship. She just wants to pursue God and that's awesome of her.

That's pretty much the only thing I can say to address the dcavenger hunt. It was a whirlwind!! We took off at Three forty one and had to be back at seven sharp. My team was one minutes early. My team consisted of Cheryl,(she drove the car) Micah,(he's such a goof!), Anna and me. We actually had a lot of fun together. We came in second place with the points, so we did pretty great. We went to ALL KINDS of places, the firestation, the mall, Mcdonalds, Jack in the Box, other fast food restraunts, we stopped people at icecream places, we went to a restraunt and asked what their most expensive item was, and so on and so on. I have so many stories I just can't tell them all to ya'll. But it was awesome. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy/biggrina.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And then we came back and had pizza and soda and after that we watched an Abbot and Costella movie which was actually pretty funny. It was the one with the werewolf, dracula, and frankenstein. Jesse P. came up and sat by me during the middle of the movie and he kept leaning over and whispering stuff to me!! I was so surprised. Like at one point I guess he didn't hear what the charectar said because he leaned over and whispered in my ear, &quot;What did she say?&quot; So of course I had to answer him. Dracula was pretty gross so at another point he said man he's pretty gross and I agreed aand said, &quot;What are you scared?&quot;  and he made a face and said &quot;Help me Amie, I'm scared!&quot; I had a looooot of fun with him. I'm just glad my friend Tia wasn't there, becasue Tia likes Jesse. She might have been mad but what did I actually do? He was the one talkign to me and he's funny so i just talked back to him as a friend. Ughhh.

Well I finished it. It took me less than two weeks and I'm very proud of that. The past three days I've been very depressed that I'm almost done with it and how sad things were tunrning out. I bawled a few times Saturday. And today I finished it. Sigh..... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cry --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/suru.gif ALT=":cry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cry --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/suru.gif ALT=":cry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cry --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/suru.gif ALT=":cry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cry --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/sad/suru.gif ALT=":cry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I think it is terribly sad that Frodo goes to The Grey Havens. I just think it's terribly sad that he couldn't live a normal life becasue he bore the ring for too long. I thought it was sad when they had to part from Aragorn who eventually dies soon too, with his wife Arwen following. It's just terribly sad. The only good thing is that I knowFrodo in the book was at peace about going and he eventually would have complete peace out there on the sea or wherever he went. Oh and I was happy that he got to be again with Bilbo and Gandalf. That gave me a little happiness. But I was terribly heartbroken when he had to sya goodbye to Sam, his faithful servant who stuck through him in thick and thin. That parting was horrible but I was at least a little happy that Sam eventually follows Frodo years later out to the Grey Havens himself because he bor e the ring for a little while too. Sigh..... It was the best series I've ever read, but one of the saddest too. I mean it was agood ending but still a pretty sad one too. I was relieved of course to know that they destroyed the ring but still........ The only death I wasn't sad about was Saurmen's. Gollum's I was mixed up about, but Gandlaf was right when he said that Gollum might ave a part to play in the end that they couldn't forsee. He was right. I dearly hope that somehow the movie's will be a little bit happier. Peter Jackson has already said that they're not doing the scouring of the Shire. So maybe..... Maybe Frodo won't leave. *Hopefully grins!* But even if it isn't, I'll still go see it for this was a joy to read and an magnifacent peace of fiction and it'll be great to watch the next two movies. Well okay, I 'm done whining and raving over the books. I'm now reading the books aloud to my sister, Ellie. She likes them. We are now at The Council of Elrond. I am enjoying reading them a second time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy/biggrina.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/umytodd1126.showPublicProfile?language=EN>myTodd1126</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/cl/cl_3.gif> Rock on dude!</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#3333ff>(7/10/02 1:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fchristlikebookloversfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Amie's Journal!!</span><hr size=1> I'm a little distressed diary. I wish I didn't have to go through all this &quot;who likes who?&quot; stuff at my age. It's just so stupid. It leaves you feeling brokenhearted and frusturated. The guy I really used to like, Nick, well I just found out today that he likes this girl who's on another team. See I'm on his team at our little Vacation bible school thing where we're leaders. And you know I'm not really upset about it but it's just that feeling of, &quot;Oh if you had still liked him you would have been brokenhearted so you still feel a little sad.&quot; You know what I mean? It was weird though, like a lightening bolt from heaven  as Katie would say. Nick could admit to me that he likes someone else and that proved to me that he doesn't like me. I really am okay. It was just definetly a message from God to just be friends with him and not worry about Jesse and all this stupid stuff. It's just completely silly. We're too young to even worry about this stuff. But oh how we do! I'm gonna make a commitment though to not get too worried about all this stuff and to just pursue friendships with all my guy-friends. That's the best thing to do until I'm eighteen or something!

I have a lot to tell and some of it is pretty silly but some of it, well.... *GG* I'm insane! I hope who I am writing about NEVER sees this!! That would be pretty embarrassing. Well anyway in my last entry I told you the whole fiasco with Nick and my whole lightening bolt from God thing... Well anyway I was pretty depressed but I soon snapped out of it and was energetic the next Tuesday, ready for three last days of fun at KOV(Kids of Victory.) Tuesday was our second water where we went to Queenie Park and swam. it's a huge pool and it was packed enough without adding a hundred and ten kids and sixty leaders!(me included..)Well anyway in my team(The Tomatos.) we were all assigned to a little kid who couldn't swim as our buddy. Well when we got there my buddy wanted to go off with her mommy so I was free of a kid! But I ended up helping my friends Kim and Maria with their kids for a while. Kim's sixteen but she is extremely nice and awesome with me so I was kind of hanging out with her. She's really short, I mean shorter then me and I'm only five feet. But she is soo cute and nice. Well anyway I've talked about Jesse before so he came up and started teasing Kim 'cause he's a few inches taller than me and Kim. Well Kim started wrestling with him and I kind of joined in and he had us both dunked in two seconds. We swam off and he went back to his friends. And then I went over and somehow I said something and then he said, &quot;Bring it on!&quot; and I jumped kind of on him. He grabbed my wrists tightly and like had me dunked in two seconds! I came up literally shocked and asked if he took wrestling and he said, &quot;No I'm just strong!&quot; And then I swam off plotting revenge and I got one little girl on my team to get in my arms and then I swam close to Jesse who was playing dead man in the water,(So he was not expecting this at all.) and I threw Shekinah(That's her name) onto his back and he immediatly came up. I was dying laughing and so was Shekinah and then he said, &quot;Oh I am going to get you Amie.&quot; and swam off. I didn't really think anything of it but sure enough twenty minutes later while I was standing in four fee t water watching all the kids swim not suspecting a thing I felt somebody as big as me jump on my back. It hurt! And then we started wrestling and he was laughing 'cause he joke worked. I am telling the truth, I will NEVER again try to challenge somebody when I don't know their strength. He's not that much taller then me and he's ten times stronger then me. He beat me in the wrestling round. Well and then I got my little sister and her cute friend Grace to swim up behind him and jump on him at the same time and it worked! They came swimming back laughing and he swam up behind and said, &quot;I know you did that Amie.&quot; and then he said, &quot;We're friends now so I won't do anything to you but Grace is another story.&quot; and with that he dunked poor Grace and then I picked her up and my sister was hanging onto me and I said, &quot;Sorry but what you do to Grace you have to do to me.&quot; and then he dunked all three of us at the same time. I came spouting water and I squealed, &quot;Why did you do that Jesse?&quot; and all his friends were gathered round now for some weird reason and he said, &quot;Because you're so beautiful I can't help myself.&quot;  I was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo embarrassed. My sisters jaw dropped open and then Kenan one of Jesse's good friends and one of my friends too said, &quot;OOO you can't argue with that Amie.&quot;  I turned as red as a tomato and then swam away. I mean any girl would love a compliment like that and I did but..... I so want to pursue God and not be worried about all this stuff and that is what I am striving and doing. But stuff like that makes it hard. But I still am pursuing God as my fulfillment, but I'm just good friends with Jesse. It's really fun. I'm in ZAP now and that's the youth group he goes to too of course and our youth group encourages just being friends until you can actually do something about it and they encourage courtship too. Not a strict form of courtship but defiantly not dating. So I know pretty well too that Jesse's family encourages that too and he grew up learning the same thing and I think that's awesome because I grew up hearing some of the same things. But I still ahve to finish this story. We finished swimming and then we went back to Victory and I was waiting for my mom and Jesse came up and said, &quot;Who got whipped at the pool today?&quot; And I admitted I did but that I didn't care. And then he stated asking about my boy cousin- Jesse who had come to Zap the past Sunday and would probably be coming back and then I left with my mom and sisters. Okay now let me think, the next day was the nursing home day field trip and two teams had to stay behind and mine was some of them. But I did talk to Jesse a little bit that day. We played one of KOV favorite games which is called human farkling. That's where you stand back to back and you sing this little song and then you jump around and can either be a gorilla, karate man or gun. the song goes like this. <br>
 Gorilla beats the man<br>
 the man beats the gun<br>
 the gun beats gorilla and if <br>
 you tie you die. <br>
and then count down form five and jump around and pick one of those. Well all the teams were doing it while we waited for the announcements from Harry. You had to pick a partner and I walked over to Jesse on the second round and and pointed at him saying, &quot;Come here Jesse.&quot; and the same time he was saying, &quot;You're going down.&quot;  Well we turned back to back but we weren't really back to back because I was embarrassed with any contact and when the song started he purposely banged his shoulder blade into my shoulder. So I did it back to him and then we were back to back and sadly I admit he beated me. He was soo happy it seemed. I took it good naturally. Then the teams went to the nursing home and my team and the Carrots stayed behind and cleaned up the cafeteria for extra points and then played water balloon vollyball. We beat them!! And then the teams got back and we went to the ZAP room to wait for our parent and I asked Jesse how it went and he said good and then I can't remember what I said and then I left. The next day was the last day and that was yesterday. Ummmm we had the announcements and then my team had a teaching and then games and we were against the French peas and that's the team that Jesse is on. Well the game was where you had to find a partner form the other team and then you would lock arms back to back and sit on your butt and then keeping your hands locked and not touching the ground with them stand up. It was soo hard with my little girl that was my first partner. Then you had to find a group of three to be in. Jesse called me over to be with him and Elizabeth Meany. She's really nice. I was in the middle so I locked arms with Jesse and Elizabeth. Jesse's grip was really tight and I was sore afterwards. (I know I'm a baby.) We actually got up really fast. Then you had to find a group of four. Maria added to our threesome. I locked this time with Maria and Elizabeth. Then the next time I locked  again with Jesse and then Maria. It was snow a group of six. We had added two little boys form my team to our group. We got up fairly fast and I was still locked with Jesse and I said, &quot;Let go!&quot; and he looked at me really funny and kinda smiled and said sorry, then let go. It was weird. Then the games ended and we went to crafts and then it was lunchtime and almost field day!!! Field day is the last day of KOV and you do lots of games outside and then a huge obstacle course. Then you have a cheer competition between all the teams and then a pyramid building competition. Well all the leaders get a break at lunchtime to go upstairs and eat together. I was waiting for I don't know what and I was standing by my team and then Jesse came up and inconspicuously took a candy bar form on of the little boys on my team and he didn't notice it. I said horrified, &quot;Jesse!&quot;  and he put a finger to his lips and said, &quot;Shhhh&quot; and we walked off. Then I said &quot;Jesse I can't believe you did that!&quot;  and he laughed and said, &quot;I'm going to give it back and you knew that right? right? right?&quot; It was kind of annoying but I smiled and then he said, &quot;See.&quot;  Then he told me sort of teasing and sort of serious, &quot;You need to calm down.&quot; I listened to that and actually took it to heart and I have calmed down a little bit more about stuff like that. Then we went up to the lunchroom and I sat with Maria and another nice girl. During the lunch period time you had to vote for counselor female and male of the year. For girl I voted for Michelle. It's a long story but see she's on the french Peas and they had a little girl on their team who has a lot of health problems and because of that she's very overweight. Well on Wednesday she didn't come and we found out that she was in the hospital. Michelle had already lost her voice from screaming so much the past week, and she made a huge get well poster signed by almost everybody(I didn't do it. I didn't know I was supposed to sign it.) Then she left in the middle of Kids of victory Wednesday and went to the hospital to visit Sydney. So I voted for her. She deserved to win. Then for male counselor I voted for Jesse because he was awesome with all the kids on his team. He was crazy with them when they were crazy, he carried them all around on his back just about all the time it seemed. (Like me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .) He was just a really good leader. So I voted for him. Then after lunch field day started. We were actually doing pretty bad with all the games. We lost the first four I think. And then we came to championship for the obstacle course and we put three kids in and they won all of their races!! Out of like right races we won six!!! I think form losing so many games it made the kids light a fire within them that made them WANT to win and do better as a team!! Then we were on fire. We screamed louder then everybody else it seemed for our team and we did so many cheers one after another that I almost lost my voice on the middle of it!! Then in the last race for the championship, our little Shon won!! He was like lightening. It was soo cool. And then we had twenty minutes to make up a cheer for the cheer competition and this is how we ended up doing it for the judges at the competition. We formed two lines of rasberry tomatos and red tomatos and then we marched yelling, &quot;Tomatos, ohh!! Tomatos, ohh!&quot; and as we sang that we marched forming a T and then we jumped aound to afce the judges and Jesse's oldest brother who was on my team(Josh) clapped three times and then we started our cheer and this is how it went... it's based on the Veggie tale theme song. <br>
If you like to talk to tomatos<br>
if a Bob can make you smile<br>
if you like to pkay with Tomatos<br>
here at Kids of Victory<br>
Have we got a team for you!!<br>
Tomatos <br>
Tomatos<br>
Tomatos <br>
Tomatos<br>
Tomatos <br>
Tomatos<br>
Tomatos<br>
TOMATOS<br>
Harry!(Harry and his wife and Tony and his wife are the head of KOV but it's mostly Harry and Donna.)<br>
Tony!<br>
Gotta be Tomatos!<br>
Dynamite, outta sight, vegemite, Tomatos!<br>
There's never ever ever ever been a team like Tomatos!<br>
There's never ever ever ever been a team like Tomatos!<br>
It's time TOMATOS!!!<br>
And then we dropped down and there was tons of cheering and then when it subsided Josh got up and made a sign of countign three time and we jumpe up on the third time and cvlappe dand then said That's us! <br>
Me and the other leaders were so proud of the kids. they worked sooo hard and they did their best till the very end. It didn't matter if we won or didn't, we had done our best. Then we listened to all the other teams cheers and at the end my team jumpe up after the last team(The French peas) were done and started yelling at the top of our luns a cheer Jesse had taught the Peas and The Tomatos. It went like this.<br>
United we stand!<br>
Divided we fall!<br>
We play as a team or<br>
we don't play at all!!<br>
Then you just repeat it. After the first round Jesse and the Peas jumped din and soon every single team was yelling this as loud as they could. it was amazing. It showed a unity between all of this and that it didn't matter who won. It was soo cool and the Tomatos started it!!! then we went back to the Zap room since it was closing time,(Three o'clock.) The Tomatos were blessed that we didn't have time to do the pyramids because we hadn't had time to practice ours. that was defiantly a God-Thing. So went to the ZAP room and we waited for  our parents. When we were walking in Jesse was like, &quot;Your team went down!&quot; and I was like &quot;Yeah right. ours was a new cheer. Every cheer you guys id was one you had already made up.&quot; And he was like. &quot;No not the rap.&quot; and then we went in and started talking to other people but eventually we met together again in the middle and I was like, &quot;Your team is going down tonight when they announce the winner.&quot; And then one of my friends walked up and said somethign about The French peas to Jesse and he said to me, &quot;See? She's nice.&quot; and I smiled and said, &quot;I'm just kidding. You guys are awesome.&quot; and Jesse smiled and then side hugged me while he said, &quot;aww you are too.&quot;  Then I left.  A few hours later I was BACK there getting ready to hear the winner. It was dessert night where all the parents come and get a taste of what we had done and to announce the winner. The BlueBerries won for the best cheers, The French peas won for Best Spirit, we won the relay race and then it was time for first place, second place and third place. The French peas got third place, The Blueberries got second, and the Larry Boy's got first. Our kids took it pretty well. WE were so proud of them and all that they had done. Then they had this six minute video to play of pictures from the five days and I almost cried. It was really touching. These kids were amazing and I learned a lot form them. that day fifty kids had asked Jesus into their heart and I was amazed. Wee did worship too and then we split off into groups and started to do games and teaching and stuff. But before that they announced The Counselors of the year. Oh wait but before that Michelle said really loud, &quot;Somebody's here that needs a round of applause.&quot; and we all turned around and there was Sydney!! WE all were screaming and clapping and it was amazing. Then they announced the counselors of the year and it was Michelle(Who deserved it.) and Jonathan.(another one of Jesse's brothers.) It was cool. Then we did all the scheduled things and then it was dessert time to eat and to get people from other teams to sign your t-shirt. I didn't have any desset, I wasn't hungry. The first person I asked to sign my t-shirt was Jesse before the throng came. I told him, 'I want this to be a memory, not something rude!&quot; He laughed and said, &quot;let me think for a minute.&quot; he came back like five minutes later and then started writing. It took him a while he did it so slowly and in the middle of his writing all the teams started singing the United We Stand song on stage. I told him he could stop and go up there but he didn't stop and kept writing. I don't know what to think of that, I would have thought he wanted to go up there, but oh well. Then he left and then later I signed his and made sure the message wasn't rude, I asked Kenan and Nick to read it. Everybody wanted to sign Jesse's and for him to sign their's. It was funny. He had this line of little girl's around him and he said not really to anybody in particular but I was standing there,&quot; Gosh what is with all these little girls?&quot; and I said, &quot;It's your hair Jesse. Your beautiful locks.&quot;  He laughed and said, &quot;Oh you like my hair?&quot;  It was funny. See he had these small green curlers in his hair last night. Then I started talking to him and I said, &quot;Do You know that we live five minutes away from eachother?&quot; His eyes kinda bugged out and he said, &quot;Where do you live?&quot; And I told him and then I said,I live right by that McDonalds. And then he asked if it was the Mcdonald by Walgreens and I said, &quot;Well yeah I live by that one too.&quot; And the  he shook his head and his eyes were bugged out. it was funny. And then I said, &quot;And guess what? My cousin lives across the street form me.&quot; Then he shook his head again and said, &quot;Man!&quot;  (See I brought my cousin Jesse to ZAP last Sunday and Jesse my friend, well him and his friends thought he was cool.) So then I said kind of bye to him and then I left. But we talked I think one more time to eachother before I left. I'll see him again this Sunday at ZAP.I'm glad we're pretty good friends now. it's easy for me to talk to him now without being embarrassed. Well that's my story. My arm is about to fall off form typing so long. But I'm going to put some of the notes form people on my shirt here...<br>

 Well anyway I don't have a lot of news but my cousin, Faith is in the childrens hospital because she has asthma. I feel really sorry for her. She just got sick and then now she has asthma. I hope she gets out soon.... <br>
 Ummm I went to ZAP last night and it waas very touching. Since a lot of people are in Guatemala, the young guys my age kind of supervised the whle night. They did the announcements, the skit and the teahcing. Well actually two older guys did the teaching but.... Anywya the teachign was on being a light to the world and that we as teenagers if you're in school or highschoool how oyu cna witness and be a lamp in this world. It really made me feel guilty that I hadn't witness to my dance friends ever. I mean what if one fo them died without Christ and I could have told them?? I don't even want to think abotu it for a second.... So after the teaching and the big skit they had an alter call. i was sittign with my friend Tia and i asked her to come up with to pray for me and she said she would. I was a little hezitant to let anyone see me go up there but she told me to be brave and I did. I sat down cross legged and jsut started praying, asking God for forgivness for me not witnessign to my friends and she put her hand on me and prayed for. A few minutes later I felt another soft hand on my back and it was Mari and she started praying for me and she even prayed aloud and what she said clearly comforted me. I felt soo good knowing I finally had christian friends who cared for me. I felt so blessed. God healed me right then and there and here I am today going to dance. I am just praying God will give me strength and courage and he will rpesent the opportunity if he wants me to witness. Last night I know Jesse saw me being prayed for and you know what?? I didn't acre. he was praying for other people and nobody cares why you'e up there, they just pray for you and for that I am grateful. I'll give a more full account later but I gotta go now.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I hate this!! I hate this!! I hate this!!! I hate that I have to go through all this boy stuff........ I talked to my friend from ZAP in the internet today and umm let's just say I have known for a while that she liked Jesse and from reading my posts you can see I like him too but I don't want to worry about it too much because it's just silly. But I can't wish away these feelings!!! I wish with all my heart that God would just block my heart from liking somebody until my future husband comes. But it just doesn't happen that way. I don't want to be distracted from God and I don't believe I will. I just don't want to hurt my friends feeligns. he's an awesome girl and I really like dher. We've become good friends in just over a month. So we were talking today on the internet and she seemed to be fishing for a clue as to whether or not I like Jesse. I answered nonchalantly but I didn't think I could hide it mcuh longer. I said bye to her and almost five minutes later called the leader of my small group who is soo awesome and gives great advice. She's soo sweet and only sixteen so I knew she would know how hard these situations can be. I just told ehr the whole story and that I really, really did not want to hurt my friend but I just can't wish away these feeling. She gave me all kinds of great advice and she's going to be praying for me and that's a definete relief. She said to pray about it a lot and i'm going to and I think I'm going to tell my friend. That's what my small group leader advised. After talking about that we just kind of talked about about Jesse and what he's said to me in general and how I should guard my emotions and not letting them totally sweep me away. She helped me more then I can say in several ways. I know I'll be calling her a lot for advice in the near future about this situation and probably others. Woever reads this: just please pray for me. I'd appreciate it a lot. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Books- Umm I finished the last book for school and now for school I'm reading The Hrse and His Boy from the Choronichles of Narnia. I really like it. I've only read the first two chapters and I'm reading more tonight but so far it's been aweosme. His style of writing is similar to J.R.R. Tolkien's who wrote Lord of The Rings. They actually were best friends in real life which is really cool. <br>
The Mitford Series- At Home in Mitford- I started this series and am on the third chapter of this book. it is soo cute and omey and cozy and I really don't ahve to say anything more about it!!! Reading three books at once is a hard thing so as you see I haven't gotten very far in this book so thr story line is not really totally set up yet but I LOVE it so far. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
The Left Behind Adult Series- In a wekk and two days I have read Assassions, The Indwelling, the Mark and am two chapters away from finishing Desecration.

I still think I will be but oh well. I didn't watch the Matrix last night 'cause there was no time. I might watch it tonight though. I need to have quiet time with God today. I've been putting it off worrying about other things that aren't that importent and I need to get back on track. The talk with Kim really energized me and pumped me to get back on track with pending more time with God. it's not a task, it's fun and it's nourishing. I'm going to ask on GLO what's a good book of the Bible to read. I want to read all the books of the Bibe in a year but not in specific order. <br>
Books- At Home in Mitford. I read like two chapters last night because it was soo intresting. I really like it. <br>
Desecration- I finished it. Really good. Nicolae is getting worse and worse by the minute though with executions of christians and plotting to kill Zsion. <br>
The Remnant-The newest book in this series and I am on the second chapter I believe. It wasn't that intresting so I put it down and picked up the other book as you can see. But I'm going to try to get some more time in today to read more of this. <br>
forever, <br>
