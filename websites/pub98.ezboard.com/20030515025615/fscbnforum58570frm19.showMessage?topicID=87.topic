It was an amazing concept.<br>
She lounged on the moonlit sand in a simple solid black bikini.  The sand was clean and crystaline.  Just at the edge of her hearing was the sound of music and laughter from the hotel.  Her young mortal companion was playing in the surf, doing cartwheels and handstands, entertaining her with his innocense.<br>
The remembered conversation played in her head.  'You'll forgive me for pointing out, but you've lost touch with the world.'  'Well, my duties have become everything.  I envy you your retainers and companions.  It is a luxury I can't afford.'  'A luxury?  No, it is a necessity.  They take care of me, whether I ask or not.  They remind me to live, to care.'  She had smiled at Kaergon's earnest, yet self depreciating humor. 'I can't exactly drag a household along with me.  Much of what I do puts me in situations where no ghoul could follow.'  He had laughed softly and winked. 'So have one in every port!'  <br>
She had been touched.  It had been a long time since anyone had talked *to* her.  Not at her, or only about whatever issue she had come to town to deal with.  Kaergon Roche, despite the reason for her being in the City, had spoken to her of nothing but life.  He had not begged or pleaded his case, pointed fingers or thrown blame.  He had simply acknowledged her interest in his retainers and their liberties, and chatted with her.  As if she were a person.  Not an automated steno machine, not an underling to some greater power, not a uberpowered monster come to whip idiot children to death, not an annoyance to be shined on.  Just a person.<br>
At the end of the evening they had exchanged contact information.  She had been looking forward to correspondence.  She had been sure that Kaergon would be granted some leniency and allowed to move on as well.  However in the end, she understood her superior's decision to leave his fate in the City's hands, not stepping in and wielding the Camarilla like a bullwhip.  Not that the lesson appeared to have been learned according to her latest report from Santa Carla.  She shook her head roughly, shrugging off thoughts of &quot;work&quot;.  She was on vacation.<br>
She could at least honor the self realization that Kaergon had brought her.  Her new companion, dropped into the sand next to her, breathing hard from his antics.  She admired him, warm, in his prime, well kept, witty, and good humored.  Andre had not batted an eye at his new playmate's request to go to the beach in the middle of the night.  Of course, the tropical climate and his romantic latin blood, may have mitigated the strangeness of  the request. 'One in every port.' She chuckled at the memory of Kaergon's rueful smile.  Andre grinned at her, assuming her laughter was for him.  Maurin shook off the memories and tousled his hair.  His warm dark eyes twinkled at her, reflecting moon and starlite.  Her next laugh had everything to do with the moment and nothing to do with memories.<br>
