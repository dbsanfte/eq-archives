<br>
Why are christians concerned when the second coming is going to happen? Should it really affect how you live your lives? In some ways, it really makes me feel that the morals and ethics of non-theists are more concrete because we do not concern ourselves with the second coming or salvation, but rather our own selves....<br>
<br>
Plus, I know my MIL is not saving for her retirement because she feels that judgement day is coming and will arrive before her retirement age (12 years or so for her). I find this really disturbing. Is this common among believers who believe and are concerned when the judgement day is going to happen? <br>
<br>
I know very little about end times philosophy and have enjoyed reading the topic on the other side of the board on this. Though I will admit that I do find it more amusing then anything else, I'm just astonished that people can take it so seriously and that it matters so much. I had 13 years of catholic school and never remember anything ever being mentioned about judgement day and tribulation etc. <br>
<br>
I had picked up the first book of the left behind series because I thought it was simply a sci fi/fiction novel. And thinking of it as such found it entertaining. <br>
<br>
Anyway, just wondered what other's opinions on this were.<br>
<br>
Kate - do Muslims have an end time/ judgement day belief?<br>

I don't get it either which is why I started that thread. Actually, I am pretty disturbed that so many people are focused on it. Especially regarding Iraq because I really hope that nobody in the administration is thinking of this when they are formulating US foreign policy!<br>
<br>
Really though I think people who focus on the end times miss out on an awful lot of life, you know? And I think it can lead to a very morally complacent attitude of &quot;Jesus is going to come fix everything so I don't need to bother trying to help others.&quot; Which can be really bad. And I think it can lead people to do a lot of things that can hurt them later on...like as you said your MIL not saving for retirement. <br>
<br>
I didn't read the Left Behind series. Seems sort of morbid to me in way. I mean, I am not afraid of the end of the world or of dying but I think if I were to spend my life thinking about it all the time, I would miss out on a lot of living.<br>

<br>
Is this just another difference between Catholics and other Christian denominations? I've never met a Catholic that really cared one bit about the end times. And now that I've totally stepped away from theistic beliefs I really find it puzzling. <br>
<br>
I am tempted to finish reading the left behind series just to see what it has to say. Plus the first book, if taken strickly as fiction and for enjoyment was enjoying to read. I was totally shocked when a (now former) friend offered to go through the book and show me where the related bible verses fit into the whole thing and how it really shows what the end times are going to be like. And how she is ready, but I wasn't but she was pleased I was reading this book for it will open my eyes to the true light of God - and on and on. What kills me though is at the time she was married to one man and living/pregnant by another. Had a violent temper, a week later threatened to kick my husband's ass.Cussed worse then I ever did. And on and on. <br>
<br>
Anyway, maybe some of the more strict bible is correct folks on here can explain it to us <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Plus, it depends on how you read Revelations. There are people who take it strictly literally (hence the left behind series) and believe it is a predication about the future. People who believe it was written to provide encouragement to Christians of the time it was written who were suffering persecution by the Romans (and thus believe it can provide encouragement in tough times today) and people who believe the truth is somewhere in the middle of those two extremes. There was a really good article on Beliefnet not too long back that I read that explained the different schools of thought on Revelations pretty well....you might want to read it if it is still there. I thought it was pretty interesting....but then, I'm a bit of a nerd like that....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Simply put (since ezboard zapped my last post into Neverland, - hope The Gloved One liked it) I think Revelation meets people's need for relevance. The events it describes are dramatic, surreal and vague. Therefore, one can interpret nearly any current political upheaval, war, plague or natural disaster to mean the end times are here. So it really takes advantage of the fact that we always have had, and always will have war, plagues, and so on - while capitalizing on the desire to make religion not just historical, but current.<br>
<br>
In the scriptures, Jesus is VERY CLEAR that he will be returning within the lifetime of his followers. Believers, instead of seeing that for the false prophecy that it so obviously was, choose to take it literally to mean he will return in THEIR lifetimes. Doing so, they conveniently ignore the long (uh, 2000 year) history of other believers doing the exact same thing and getting burned.<br>
<br>
Maybe Catholics are dubious about revelation because 1) that church has been around the longest, and has seen that those prophecies never get fulfilled and 2) Catholic need for relevance/currency is met through the Pope, who they consider the living Peter.<br>

As for the Left Behind series...book 11 came out Tuesday, and yep...I got my copy Tuesday morning!  After 10 books, with only 2 more to go, there's just a certain loyalty to seeing how it all ends...I could lose sleep over not knowing what happens to Buck, Chloe, Rayford, and Nicolae!

I only read them for the purpose of having an easy form of entertainment.  I tend to read pretty morbid novels that fall under the mystery/suspense/horror category.  I chose to start reading that series for nothing more than entertaining myself in these categories, and to learn the basics of &quot;end times&quot; without having to put much thought into it.  I know there are people out there who read that series thinking all that stuff is real, but to me it is no more real than your basic Stephen King novel.  <br>
<br>
I think it is ridiculous for people to live their lives expecting the rapture to come at any moment.  Even if you buy into that whole Revelations thing, what makes you so sure that it is going to happen in your lifetime.  I'm sure that world events help to convince people of this, but if they would pick up a history book once in awhile, then they would see that this isn't the only era that seemed like &quot;the end&quot;.  I bet that people thought it was end times during the Black Death in Europe during the Middle Ages.  People probably also thought it was end times during Hitler's reign or the Cold War.  Think about World War I where we not only had a war going on, but tons of people died during that period due to the Great Swine Flu Epidemic.  Personally, I think humans will see their end times either as a result of our own actions, or as a result of something scientific in nature like an asteroid or something.  I don't believe for a second that &quot;believers&quot; are just going to evaporate into thin air while the rest of us are left here to suffer.  What kind of God would allow good people to suffer from earthquakes and plagues just because we didn't kiss his son's ass?  If there is a God, then I would hope he would take a little more into account than worship.  If not, then I'd rather hang down here with the anti-Christ as opposed to spending an eternity with a narcissist.  <br>

Are the rest of the books as interesting, do you think, from a non-believer point of view? My former friend told me to enjoy the books (even the first though I do not agree) you have to know, understand, and believe the scriptures behind it. I'm bored, am having trouble finding books to read over here, and know I can get these books. But I don't want to bother if it just becomes total religious dogma, if you know what I mean. <br>

<br>
Real quick - I can offer you the explanation that most of these verses are actually telling us to be prepared, because it could happen at any minute.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>James thought that Jesus would return soon. (James 5:8 )<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
As well as 1 Peter 4:7 – both use the same Greek which expresses “is at hand”  We are to live in a continued state of expectancy for the Lord’s coming, as an event <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>always</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> near.  How “near” did James mean?  It could only be a hope, for Jesus had distinctly said that no one knew when he would return.  The term “near” here means simply to bring near or to approach.  No specific prediction was made, so no false prophesy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20, 5:4 - Peter wrongly believed that he was living in the &quot;last times.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
The “last times” referred to here are when Christ shall come a second time to judge.  This time stretches from Christ’s ascension to His coming to judgement.  Again, no specific prophesy made, so no false prophecy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Peter mistakenly believes that &quot;the end of all things is at hand.&quot; 4:7<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
 - I already spoke of this one above.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2 Peter - The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. many have begun to ask, &quot;Where is the promise of his coming?&quot; He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that &quot;one day with the Lord is as a thousand years.&quot; 3:4<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
The answer to this lies within this passage.  Not in verse 8 as stated above, but rather in verse 9.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”  In other words, He’s not going to come until everyone gets the chance to repent, and not when we (or the apostles) think He should come.<br>
 <br>
1 John 2:18 -  See notes above on “last times” <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>John warns his followers to get ready because Jesus is coming soon. 2:28<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  - This is the same thing as with the reference in James…we should always be ready.  How soon?  Well, it's sooner than it was a minute ago! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>John expects to live to see Jesus return. 3:2<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <br>
- I’m not getting this out of this verse at all, unless you pull it out of context.  This entire verse is showing us that even though as Christians, our life is a process of becoming more and more like Christ, it will not be complete until we see Christ face-to-face.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Jude - Jude says Enoch prophesied that God would come with 10,000 of his saints &quot;to execute judgment upon all.&quot; But where did he make such a prophecy? It is not recorded in the Bible. 1:14-15<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> The words quoted here are chiefly from the Book of Enoch, specifically 1 Enoch 1:9.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Revelation -John believes &quot;the time is at hand,&quot; and that the things that he writes about in Revelation will &quot;shortly come to pass.&quot; 1:1, 3 <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
- John here is urging his readers to be ready at all times for the Last Judgment and the establishment of God’s kingdom.  We don’t know when, but we must be prepared.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>John quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, &quot;Behold, I come quickly.&quot; 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
– I’ve always read this word, “quickly” to be read that when He comes, it’s going to be quick, and He’s not going to hang around waiting for people (He’s been waiting already).  But this is debatable depending on how one interprets the book of Revelation.<br>
<br>
All in all though, I’m not seeing false prophecy in these.  Now if there would have been a mention of a specific year in the Bible that Christ was to have returned – then you might have something there.  But I’ve yet to see that in my Bible.  These verses you mentioned are merely speaking to us that we are always to be watchful for Christ.<br>

When a debatant says &quot;Jesus says clearly that he will ...&quot; and the apologist responds innocently enough with &quot;please show me&quot; it is a trap.  The bible is rife with contradictions, as we have debated before.  Ultimately, nothing JC ever said or did is recorded.  All that is recorded is what OTHER's say he said or did.  There is no Book Of J-Zeus.  He did not write a single word of the bible.  So you as an apologist can ask politely for the quote and then rebut with &quot;Oh, these are all taken from the writings of X, Y or Z&quot; and retain the sanctity for your interpretation because it cannot be 'nailed down' as JC's words (no apologies for the bad pun).<br>
<br>
Another frequent tactic is to drop a losing position and not conclude or concede the debate.  I have given up on all the threads I was checking for a reply so that I could continue the repartee' where the theist just failed to reply, but had plenty of time to tirelessly continue on other threads at the same board (Mike, you still lurk here?) and say &quot;you were boring me&quot; or &quot;I don't respond to long posts&quot; or &quot;too busy&quot; etc.<br>
<br>
I appreciate your integrity as a apologist, you are a very intelligent and facile woman and I do love our exchanges; but that is kind of like the virtuous hooker fallacy (think &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pretty Woman</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;.)  You as a woman have a beautiful mind, but you are engaged in apologetics, which is more about theistic spin-doctoring for the sake of religion than the merits of intelligence you obviously possess.  I would love to see you as a children's advocacy attorney or gifted and talented programs director, I think you could do some amazing good.  I will give you credit for continuing our exchanges far beyond what anyone else sustains, yet I see some common arrows in your quiver where apologist shots are fired almost by rote.<br>

I won't say that I am not guilty of doing the same thing, but I also agree totally with you DBC.  This happens to me all of the time.  It even happens when you are asked a question and you give an answer and then no response.  What does that mean?  Maybe it means that the person has been proven wrong, but for them  to admit to it they would have to change their way of thinking and they are to comfortable in that way of thinking to want to change it.  I in fact have a question posed to me right now that I know will take alot of time for me to respond to and I don't have hours to look up the info. today, but I do have a few minutes to sit here right now.

Of course it wasn’t a challenge.  The challenge was when the atheist said something about the bible.  Then you have to cordon off the section that was referred to, dust off the canned answers and reinterpret them so as not to use plain meaning and infer heavily to make them not as awful as they really are.  If James wanted us to live ‘as though’ JC were returning any second, why not just say that?  Why lie to us and imply he was about to return instead of saying, “We have no idea when he is coming, but lets all live as though he was on our doorstep.”  Perhaps because by telling people to hurry up and get it right because if they didn’t they’d be screwed he could win more converts?  Hold the ones he already had longer?  Keep people afraid and more pliable?  I can think of many good reasons to use deceit as a tool for control, I can’t think of a single one to serve a just and benevolent all knowing god seeking beautiful salvation for his sheep.  <br>
<br>
There is a legal standard, preponderance of the evidence, that is used in deciding civil disputes.  When you take any single issue and explain it away, you have defeated the single issue, yet the collective weight of repeated and pernicious issues all of a similar character are present, you not only have to explain the individuals, you have to explain why the collective group came into being.  Okay so your bosses comments about empty-headed women wasn’t sexist because he was making a frankenstein joke about a brain, his office policy that women wear high heels is a standard of business attire, his promotion of men into management roles was entirely based on their superior credentials over the women who applied, his denial of maternity leave was a business necessity, his criticism of female performances and not men who did the same thing was to try and help the women into being better than the men so he could promote one….no single event is unexplained or sexist in motive, yet collectively they all point to him as a sexist.  No where does it say in the bible “We have no idea when JC is coming.” Everywhere it says, “Soon!  In your lifetime! Before the youngest of you dies! Next Wednesday!” etc.  You are reinterpreting the plain meaning of their words to suit your desired goals of furthering xiandom.  You even go so far as to say “for Jesus had distinctly said that no one knew” yet as pointed out before, JC never wrote anything in the bible.  Someone else claims JC said that, just as several others claim he said he’d be back any day now.  The bible is rife with contradiction and the people who wrote it were so far removed from the actual events as to have nothing more than hearsay.  (You do recall our <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showMessageRange?topicID=138.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20" target="top">debate</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> over that?
