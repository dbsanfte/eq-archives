<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>RIP Columbia Crew</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The crew of the space shuttle Columbia died as heroes, died advancing the knowledge of the human race. Not for glory, not for conquest, not for wealth did they place themselves in such great danger. But for knowledge, and the desire to better the lives of others. They were truly the finest our planet could produce. And I can think of no better tribute than to send even more right after them in their footsteps. They do our species proud. On to the review.<br>

Delenda Est (which translates to 'The Intergalactic Cat Returns') marks several great improvements over the last episode. It features lots of Rommie kung fu action. It features lots of Rommie and Harper. It features (yes) character interaction and advancement. And best of all, it moves the third season along. Not bad. Along the way, there's some really bad critter waves, and the exciting mystery of the crew. Where did the drones go? Where did the human crew go? Ah, that would be spoiling the fun. And despite its quirks, this episode was fun. Bob Engels returns to undo the damage he did to the series in the Third Season premiere. (Or pile more on, depending on your perspective.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What clings to a wall, but travels all the world? -unsolvable riddle</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I have the answer: It's an albatross, which migrates all over the world, and somehow started out by clinging to a wall. I'm a genius!<br>
<br>
The episode opens with Dylan getting a physical by the computer, and suddenly the bridge display starts showing a clip of Dylan's wife saying goodbye to him. The computer has disappeared, and Dylan is stuck watching this message play over and over again. What's a helpless captain to do? (Beka finds herself in the same situation later in this episode, and does better than Dylan.)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Rommie sidles up to Harper. As they'd say on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Seinfeld,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she's a sidler. She's into holding hands, but it's only to determine if Harper is lying when she interrogates him on whether he's been taking advantage of her. I don't recall this being a pressing loose end that needed tied up. Maybe the concept of doing things to Rommie was on the writer's mind, so that made it a priority, I don't know. But we'll tie this up later.<br>
<br>
Harper gets out of his Spanish Inquisition by the appearance of the Intergalactic Space Cat, formerly a kitten. This furry menace was last seen in the season premiere, and has now returned to destroy them all! Okay, that's not actually what happens, but it would have been cool. Suddenly the hull opens up to space, Harper is in danger of being blown out into space. And we're off to the opening credits. (The opening narrative still sucks, by the way.)<br>
<br>
Rommie saves Harper, and we return to Dylan. He's still stuck on the bridge, and still hasn't figured out how to turn off the old footage of his wife. (Did I mention Beka figures this out in half a second?) Anyway, we find Trance is being tormented by images of a star going supernova. Hey, there are lots of ways to traumatize Trance. Have a group of people comment about her hairstyle, show people pulling out germaniums and stomping on them. Anyway, Tyr bops in and remarks that he saw his child. Meanwhile, the computer reports that other ships have been attacked mysteriously, having their most important power sources removed. Dylan instantly figures out the Tunnel aliens must be after Rommie.<br>
<br>
Hello? In <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A Rose in the Ashes,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> we learn avatar Rommie can't last more than a day without ship power. So why is she a coveted energy source? Here we find the first clue that these Tunnel aliens are the dumbest ones yet to be on the show. Why didn't they just go to the nearest space station, stop by Generators R Us, and buy one there? They add new meaning to the term &quot;Critter Wave&quot;. (Many more examples to come.)<br>
<br>
Andromeda: There are still five decks missing from my grid. My avatar is unaccounted for. And there are vacuums of tremendous energy opening and closing all over the ship.<br>
<br>
Here we come to the second biggest gaffe of this episode: Did anyone tell Bob Engels that they added a human crew in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Slipfighter?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> If what Rommie says is true, then there are many people in terrible danger. How many? We don't know. What we do know is that not a single one of the new human crew members makes an appearance this episode. They apparently couldn't spare any drones, either. If any of them were blown out to space, heck if the command staff would know or care. <br>
<br>
Dylan leaves Beka in command while he and Tyr set off to find Rommie. Tyr's a good little soldier in this episode, obeying every order Dylan gives him. The captain should be proud, it's not every day you neuter and tame a Nietzchian of the Kodiac Pride. Tyr gets in trouble from a vortex, and Dylan has to save him. It's a humorous implication that Tyr is nearly helpless fighting off the vacuum, yet Dylan thinks he can rescue him. So he's from a heavy-grav planet, so what. Did Tyr grow up on a mile-long asteroid? When was it ever established he was physically weaker than Dylan?<br>
<br>
Tyr: I don't know which is worse, being re-abducted by those things or having to ask you for help.<br>
Dylan: You're joking.<br>
Tyr: Am I.<br>
Dylan: Ha Ha... I didn't 'help' you Tyr, I saved your ass.<br>
<br>
The dialogue is funny, but is it wise to make a Nietzchian the butt of your jokes? Well with Tyr, I guess it doesn't matter. Anyway Dylan locates Rommie on a monitor, she's determined to take out the aliens on her own. She engages in some delightful combat with the creeps, as Dylan and sidekick run to the assist. But they're too late, as the tunnel aliens finally teleport enough of their number in to grab Rommie and abscond with her.<br>
<br>
A problem with this episode is the lousy generic background music. There's a really cool scene where Rommie flips through the air and kicks two aliens, problem is the music playing is generic dregs. At least try to cue the music to the scene, please?<br>
<br>
Those who have the misfortune to remember the season premiere will recall Dylan taking the Maru out for no reason, only to be confronted by the tunnel aliens and forced to flee back to Andromeda. Bob must have loved that scene, because he repeats it here. In order to track Rommie, Dylan and Beka take the Maru out. Why? If the Maru had unique equipment suited for this, why hasn't Harper put any of that onto the Andromeda yet? Oh well, the Maru is attacked by a tunnel alien dreadnought, and flees back to Andromeda. Whoop de do, why did you fly that pathetic ship out in the first place? I guess the writer had time to kill.<br>
<br>
The aliens blast the heck out of them, and put a vortex in the Maru's cockpit for good measure. Safely aboard the Andromeda again (which takes no visible damage no matter how many times it is blasted this episode), the command staff plans their next move. Aha, now we move to more excitement, as Rommie is being held on a planet. So it's an excuse to reuse the Slipfighter launch sequence and have Dylan and Tyr zip them around all excited-like. <br>
<br>
Harper cracks a joke about Rommie's adaptability, but no one picks up on it. Tyr makes the sensible suggestion of simply making another Rommie avatar. Speaking of which, aren't the internals of Rommie the same as the other drones that were on the ship? Why didn't the tunnel aliens just take one of them? Hold it, Keith Hamilton Cobb has to spit out some really bad dialogue Bob has written for him.<br>
<br>
Tyr: On the other hand, I would embrace the opportunity to...<br>
Dylan: To what, Tyr?<br>
Tyr: Well, I'd like to crush these creatures into cosmic dust. I'd like to utterly and unequivocably slaughter them, I-I-I I'd like to kill them all. I'm done.<br>
<br>
You have to hand it Keith, he really tries to make dialogue like this work. 'Crush into cosmic dust'? Poor guy.<br>
<br>
Wheeee! It's slipfighter fun, as Tyr and Dylan zoom down to a tunnel on the planet's surface, which looks surprisingly like the interior of the Magog worldship. And here we reach the biggest gaffe of all in the episode. If these aliens can teleport all over the place, why not simply have a solid wall instead of a cave entrance? It would keep Dylan and Tyr out, but apparently they didn't think of that. (It gets better.)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile on the ship, a tunnel alien appears beside Harper. He does possibly the worst job attacking someone I have ever seen. (If only he had a dagger, eh?) Now I've got a theory about why these tunnel aliens fight so badly in so many scenes this episode. On <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Quake III Arena,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the easiest three settings (in ascending difficulty) are I CAN WIN, BRING IT ON, and HURT ME PLENTY. This tunnel alien that attacks Harper is clearly set to I CAN WIN. He shakes Harper around the bridge, it looks like he's trying to do the two-step with him. Finally Beka and Trance end the humiliation, and shoot the hapless invader. (That's funny, I'd have thought battle action Trance would have engaged in fisticuffs.)<br>
<br>
Inside the cave, Dylan expresses skepticism about whether he can trust Tyr. So let me get this straight, if Tyr is possessed by the tunnel aliens, he may be looking for a selfish opportunity to kill Dylan. If Tyr is not possessed by the tunnel aliens, he may be looking for a selfish opportunity to kill Dylan. HELLO? What's the difference?! At least Tyr handles the situation well, making Dylan laugh. He's like the court jester of Nietzchians.<br>
<br>
Harper and Trance go around the corridors looking for aliens. At intervals through this episode we are shown some sort of &quot;alien eye view&quot; from the ceiling. This might have more impact if we hadn't seen dozens of these aliens appearing at eye level previously, why are these ones choosing to hang on the ceiling? It doesn't matter, Trance easily blasts the inept invader. But the scenes not a total loss, we get some more of that choice dialogue only the writer comprehends.<br>
<br>
Harper: Well that was way too easy. What the hell is with these things?<br>
Trance: If I had seen these creatures before, why don't they look familiar?<br>
Harper: Is that a rhetorical question?<br>
Trance: You shouldn't be afraid to ask any question.<br>
<br>
That's what I say. Such as: Aren't you busy enough being an executive producer, do you have to write these, too?<br>
<br>
Here comes one of my favorite scenes this episode, Beka is at the controls, and the tunnel aliens try to distract her by showing her footage of her and Tyr kissing. This is amazing security cam footage, it even circles around the kissing couple! Anyway Beka says &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Nice try, creeps</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;, taps THREE BUTTONS, and the screen returns to normal! How pathetic is it that Dylan doesn't even know how to do this, he just paced around the bridge whimpering to himself about how he couldn't turn off that transmission of his wife. <br>
<br>
Dylan and Tyr stumble across two tunnel aliens who are phasing in and out. The aliens don't move, despite seeing Dylan duck in twice looking right at them. Our heroes shoot the braindead aliens, who suddenly move a bit more as they fall down dead. <br>
<br>
Our intrepid duo find themselves standing at the edge of a deep chasm, where lava flows await those who fall. The only thing getting them to their destination is a foot-thick walkway. Now I'm not an expert on alien stronghold design, but the aliens could have handled this several ways. They could have made it a retractable drawbridge, but they didn't do that. They could have phased the walkway so that Dylan and Tyr fall down to a lava death. But they don't do any of these things, as Dylan and Tyr head across and to commercial break.<br>
<br>
As soon as they are halfway across, two stupid aliens appear in front of them. They slowly walk towards our heroes, who blast them and watch them fall. They make bets on which one will reach the bottom first. Cute, but these have got to be the dumbest aliens in any universe. Tyr blasts the door open, and they enter to find Rommie trussed up to a bunch of power cables. The aliens apparently know that hooking cables to Rommie's hips provides ultimate power thrust. (Write your own punchline here.)<br>
<br>
They free Rommie from the contraption, and apparently don't worry that they've reprogrammed her mind to be the ultimate agent of evil. Thank goodness the aliens weren't that skilled! In fact, the aliens left all of her motor functions intact, a real drawback in the ensuing battle as more aliens teleport in the room. After easily dispatching them, we switch to Andromeda where they are again being menaced by the gigantic tunnel death fleet. <br>
<br>
They devise a timer bomb to take out the alien generator, I'm surprised Tyr couldn't have just blasted a few control panels. Meanwhile Andromeda starts blasting one of the alien ships, firing a bunch of cute blue laser bolts at it. Now I admit I haven't paid the closest attention to changes over the seasons, but what happened to the concept that Andromeda's main weapons were missiles? Now it has zippy blue laser bolts. <br>
<br>
Now we come to my favorite fight scene with the dumb aliens, as our heroes run out of the room and across the bridge. Aliens teleport directly in front of them, blocking their way. And more, two aliens teleport behind them, right in front of the blasted door. Now a disloyal viewer might ask, why didn't these numbnuts teleport in front of the blasted door before Dylan and Tyr went through there, detached Rommie, and planted a bomb? Were they all at the Bingo hall? This is really sad when you have to write villains this dumb to make the episode work. <br>
<br>
You know, I used to think the Ogami were the dumbest critter wave aliens to menace our heroes. But even they managed to bring shields and battle axes. These idiot tunnelers just wander forward with no weapons, and no attack plan. If they could talk, they would be saying, &quot;Please throw us from the walkway, we are too incompetant to live.&quot; (Oh you laugh now, the tunnelers aren't done yet.)<br>
<br>
Harper gets to work reassembling his &quot;Jaws of Life&quot; machine, and Andromeda tells him she can't lend him a hand. Um, don't you have hundreds of drones walking around the ship? What do you mean you can't help him? Where are those drones, anyway? Where is the human crew that replaced the drones? What the frell?<br>
<br>
The tunnel death fleet blasts a zillion explosions all over Andromeda's hull. Yet amazingly, not a scratch of damage is seen! It's like when you're playing Gran Turismo 2, and you crash your car 130 MPH against the rail, and there's not even a scratch of damage. Same principle here. (Again I ask, why do you take the Maru out when it doesn't have this kind of hull?)<br>
<br>
The slipfighters return to Andromeda, helping to blast a number of hapless alien dreadnoughts on the way. Dylan instructs Harper to make his science-less device again, the one that somehow drove off the aliens the last time. Speaking of which, this was a known threat the whole season. Why hasn't Harper been working on ways to block the aliens' means of sneaking onto the ship or scrambling their computer? Why hasn't he shared this &quot;Jaws of Life&quot; device with all these other ships menaced by these aliens? And how did the aliens know in which galaxy to find Andromeda at all? (I'd better stop now before the cat claws me.) <br>
<br>
Beka and Tyr get a cute exchange on having kids, Tyr got caught completely by surprise on that one. Dylan orders all missiles to be fired, and instead of missiles we see bright yellow flashes from odd areas on the hull, as zappy sounds come out. Again, if the sound editing is this bad, just turn off the sound effects and music completely if they do nothing but detract. <br>
<br>
But thank goodness there's incompetance all around, as the hapless aliens run back into the control room a mere number of hours after Dylan and crew have left. They come across the bomb, but just have time to look around stupidly before they and the planet are blown to smitheroonies. <br>
<br>
With the power source cut off, the alien fleet is rendered impotent, they didn't even put backup power on those ships. Harper's gadget closes the tunnel, and the aliens open up another vortex on the bridge just out of spite. I can picture the tunnel commander, &quot;Those jerks! I am sick of their interference, have another vortex, you clowns!&quot;<br>
<br>
Harper gets to hug Rommie, confirming to her that he never did anything improper with her. Beka has an odd scene with Dylan insisting he get a checkup from Andromeda. Would this be the medical checkup that Tyr and Beka didn't have to have after their possession in the season premiere?<br>
<br>
Suddenly a tunnel alien appears, offering a dagger to Dylan. My brother said this was some deep symbolism from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Predator 2,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but I never saw that movie. To me the message is, if the tunnel aliens had bothered arming each warrior with such knives, they'd have won. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Duh.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
So this episode was a improvement (for me) over the last episode, it was great fun in parts. On the positive side, lots of great character interaction, lots of Rommie gettin' physical, and I have to admit, Bob Engels really has done a top-notch job getting these characters down. They interact, they have dialogue, these are the things I've missed this season!<br>
<br>
I've already talked enough about the negatives, but the aliens were needlessly pathetic, and the absolute lack of the human crew took this episode right into camp. But even really bad camp can be fun at times, and this was certainly fun. Kudos to Bob Engels for progressing as a writer, but really, take some time off, relax, and let the professionals write. Like Dylan, the executive producer is clearly overworked, and should cut back on one of his duties.

Dude, it wasn't even the same freaking show.<br>
<br>
It bore as much resemblance to classic Drom as that fish episode with Gabrielle losing her memory bore to Xena.<br>
<br>
I don't understand how ANYONE who liked season one could do anything but mostly cringe (and occassionally laugh) at this Dick and Jane version of a show that has gone from one of great potential to a sorry sack of mediocrity (at best).<br>

I strive to write funny episode reviews, but I think we can agree this one wrote itself. <br>
<br>
Just how incredibly dumb do they have to write aliens for the heroes to succeed? Would the Borg have been so menacing if they had always been written like this? (Well they were on Voyager, and we saw how well that went). <br>
<br>
Writing the villains as extra dumb doesn't make the heroes look good. It makes Dylan and company LOOK BAD. This should be a basic understanding to any writer, why is it Bob Engels is so clueless? Bob Engels is even more clueless than his own tunnel aliens! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

None of it means anything except as a test.  Either a lab animal type test or a rite of passage type test.<br>
<br>
For example, you're right Ogami when did she become a huge power source?<br>
<br>
Perhaps that was all a test to see if they would come get her.<br>
<br>
The Derivas come across as expendible.<br>
<br>
It's all connected, IMO, to the line from last weeks ep about preparing for the big battle.<br>
<br>
And in regards to no plot.<br>
<br>
Let's see-the Derivas show up again to cause chaos among the crew.  Rommie decides that she's tired of seeing the havoc and endangerment of her crew-she decides to take them on.  Dylan realizes that there's another invasion going on and he takes on the Derivas.  Except that it's all a test, like Trance said.  And it looks like they reached a new level.<br>
<br>
Beginning, Middle and End-that's a plot.<br>
<br>
And yea Ogami-the lack of the other crew members was bad but I wonder if this ep wasn't suppose to air before Sands.<br>
<br>
Maybe.<br>

I can over look the reusing of footage.<br>

Now the clips being shown-Sara's goodbye, the star blowing up, the kiss between Tyr and Beka-those were all there to mess with the mind of the crew.  In other words it's a part of the story.<br>

But this makes the aliens even dumber, this episode was one long scavenger hunt for them. Why didn't they just go to Niet-Mart? (That's the futuristic version of Wal-Mart.)<br>

Actually Ogami his post shows it's a response to Post 7705.1 which IS your opening post.<br>

&quot;I wouldn't crack open any epic novels.&quot; - Tyr<br>
In the current Andromeda environment I think Tyr is right.<br>
Social Climbers - They will quite cunningly take whatever Alpha prerogatives you stupidly give them.<br>
I think I'm right too!<br>

<br>
&quot;Why Ogami, I didn't think that you still cared  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;<br>
<br>
He was either commenting on my criticism, or the fact that I was one of the few who was entertained by this episode, and praised Bob Engels' learning curve. I'll take it as a compliment, he posted for a very long time on the Slipstream Episode section, always avoiding my reviews. Yet he commented on this one, nice to see he read at least some of it. <br>

Yes, you get what I found appealing about this paper-thin episode. Everyone was there, interacting, talking, engaging. A far cry from much of this season, even when everyone is on the ship.<br>
