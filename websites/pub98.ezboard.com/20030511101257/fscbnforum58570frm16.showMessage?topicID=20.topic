<br>
1) What kind of justification, if any, does a player with Auspex need to use that Discipline to spot someone in &quot;Ob&quot;? The book uses the term &quot;An individual with Auspex (or another power of supernatural sensitivity) may penetrate Obfuscate if he is already looking for hidden individuals.&quot; Obviously, this is a little vague in terms of putting it into practice. If a OOC a player knows there's nobody around in ob, they won't bother using it. If they know there is somebody around OOC, they certainly will. Is this something that's come up in discussion before?<br>
<br>
2) And this is somewhat related to what Yoshi brought up. Regarding video cameras and digital cameras and other film, does an individual in obfuscate appear, say, if we're talking about a tape-delay security camera? The book is very fuzzy on such subjects.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stephencrowley>Stephen Crowley</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://lagoon.freebsd.lublin.pl/~fenix/smieci/graf/rozne/vampire/camarilla.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 2/18/03 9:42:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hart@scbnforum58570>Hart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/18/03 5:31:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rules Clarication - Obfuscate</span><hr size=1> 1)  As the book example, if a character has reason to &quot;search&quot; a space with auspex, for instance to &quot;secure&quot; a space, or if they have been given reason to believe someone may be there, then using auspex to try to weed out sneaks and such.  Also it is generally played out that if someone does something suspicious in obfuscate that might give them away, such as knocking into something, that someone with auspex or hightened senses might find them out.  However players should be given the benefit of the doubt, a 175# player in dumb but pretty shoes stomping along may indeed be playing a delicate waif, traipsing gracefully along.<br>
<br>
2)  Obfuscate is not proof against video at basic and intermediate levels, I do believe there are some advanced disciplines that can beat the security... but my book is not at hand. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theherald@scbnforum58570>The Herald</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Clan Malkavian</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/18/03 11:29:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rules Clarication - Obfuscate</span><hr size=1> One other thing to keep in mind for role playing purposes is that Obfuscate is a MENTAL, not a PHYSICAL discipline.  This means that if I am successful in my challenge I am fooling your perception of your senses, not the senses themselves.  Therefore you show up on cameras because you /are/ there, even if no one can see you. <br>
<br>
In addition, it is usually considered by myself and others 'foul play' to immdiately look for obfuscated people when they come into snooping range.  Even if your character is paranoid, walking around with heightened senses on is a great way to be deafened, blinded or over stimulated in general.  Simply put, if you have an IC reason to look - then look and feel free to put your finger to your eye and look around, even if no one is there to watch you do it.  That helps me stay in character.<br>

<br>
I think what Mike is trying to ask is how does obfuscate and security cameras work?  When can the character be seen and when can he not on the tape?<br>
<br>
All disciplines, unless otherwise stated, are line of sight only.  That means that you can only fool someone that could &quot;see&quot; you (even if they aren't actually &quot;seeing&quot; you due to obfuscate).  Therefore, a guard watching a monitor in a closed room where the hiding character can not see him sees the hiding character perfectly well.<br>
<br>
If the same guard were watching from a desk in the lobby that the character is sneaking through, the guard wouldn't notice anything amiss.<br>
<br>
Here's where it gets a little tricky...<br>
<br>
I *think* that obfuscate is retroactive.  The guard from the lobby didn't see the kindred in question on the first pass, but if, for some reason, he gets a chance to review the tape, he will see what he didn't the first time around (the obfuscating character).  HOWEVER, if the character is still with him (and hiding) when he is reviewing the tape, he is still hidden and/or masked on the tape.<br>
<br>
Strange stuff, no?<br>
<br>
As to when it's ok to check.  Darren has a good and reliable way.  If you set up a pattern of when you are looking for hidden people, no one can say anything when you check.<br>
<br>
I also make it a practice to use Auspex occasionally to check for snoops, sometimes even if no one else is around.<br>

<br>
Video or technological equipment defeats obfuscation period. A Nosferatu sneaking into the lobby of a building monitored by video cameras, would appear to a guard in another room as a horrid monster sneaking through the lobby, pretending like he/she is hidden. Others around her would not regard that creature at all, but someone in the same area watching a video camera would NOT see that person. For example a guard at the front desk would not see the Nosferatu sneak past him, even if he was looking at the camera. However, the Nosferatu sure as hell is on tape walking past. He does not fool the camera. Here's why:<br>
<br>
<b>When you obfuscate you are in a sense projecting a form of limited dominate onto a group around your presence. Constantly you are sending off little messages that say "Don't see me" ..."Don't see me". And most mortals don't see you, because their mind simply blocks you out.</b><br>
<br>
Now since a mechanical device cannot be dominated under "normal" levels of Obfuscation, it is never fooled by an Obfuscation invasion. Also, since a guard or observer not in the presence of the Nosferatu is not affected by the "Don't see me" message, he/she can see the Nosferatu just fine through the camera. Chris is right that basically Obfuscation is a "line of sight" power. Now, at Master level disciplines there are rumors that Obfuscate can affect machinery too. However, this is beyond the power of most neonates.<br>
<br>
Its the classic flaw of Vampire in the modern age: Technology can defeat the ancient powers of vampires quite easily in some cases. Guns, missles, computers, and other technologies are the bane of even the most powerful Elders. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=antoineleblanc@scbnforum58570>Antoine leblanc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/21/03 5:17:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Obfuscation </span><hr size=1> From Vampire The Masquerade pg 166 &quot;... such is Obfuscates ability to bend the mind that someone using a recording device will not see the immortals image until she views the footage at a later date, if even then.<br>
<br>
IMHO, letting people with cameras see through Obfuscate without tests takes away from gameplay.  If nothing else, they should be allowed tests with the stealth ability to avoid the cameras. <br>

When I first started this game, I was told that film viewed in &quot;real time&quot; wouldn't pick up ob, because the person (not the machine) seeing the film in real time would be affected.      <br>
<br>
Assuming the ob'd character was going in to some place WORTH sneaking into, you've got to assume the security tapes would be reviewed at some point. At that point, they'd usually be spotted, with whatever consequences normally ensuing.  <br>
<br>
Nos, of course, would have a double-wammy. Not only would they be seen, but by their very appearance they are a walking Masquerade breach, even with Mask of 1000 Faces. <br>
<br>
There is a Merit in the Nos clan book that corrects that. Would it be applicable?<br>
<br>
By the way, is simple use of Obfuscate in Elysium in and of itself a violation of the 2nd or 5th Traditions? I mean, assuming they ob'd character wasn't up to some mischief, but otherwise had no special permission.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tcalloway>TCalloway</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/21/03 6:52:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Masquerade</span><hr size=1> I would submit that breaking into anywhere could be seen as a Masquerade breach. If someone tracked you down and found your actual vampire (as opposed to a cover blind of some sort), that would almost neccessarily lead to them discovering your condition. While this, unto itself, isn't neccessarily a breach, it almost certainly is, especially since making the incident disappear will take a lot more than killing the initial investigator if he has friends or is part of an organization of some sort. My point is this: little things are often breaches, not just putting your claws through a cop in Celerity on Pacific ave.<br>

Not a bad point. Of course, in my perfect little world, any vamp worth his bones will take the time to make sure such things don't become issues. Some vampires could sneek in by pretending to be, say, a night janitor or some other relatively minor position that usually doesn't raise many questions. So get in, get out, and leave no indication that you were there. (Unless, of course, you're there to steal some object or kill someone, in which case other measures can be taken.)<br>

Hence, the existence of the 7th Tradition; the one the preceeds all others:<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't get caught.&quot;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
