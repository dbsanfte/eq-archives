Nimoy's `Shekhina' photos upset Jewish community<br>
<br>
By Jan Sjostrom<br>
Cox News Service<br>
Published February 20, 2003<br>
<br>
PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Shouts filled the temple. The Orthodox Jewish priests were bestowing the high holiday blessing.<br>
<br>
In the congregation was an 8-year-old boy. His father had told him he must not look up. But he could not resist. Raising his eyes, he saw the priests making a V-shaped hand gesture.<br>
<br>
The image burned itself into his memory. It came out 27 years later, when Leonard Nimoy introduced the Vulcan hand salute in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. Nimoy played Spock in the series and in six feature films.<br>
<br>
The memory resurfaced again in Nimoy's photographic series &quot;Shekhina.&quot; The series, which occupied the photographer for eight years, is collected in a book, published by Umbrage Editions in October. Many of the photographs are at the Armory Art Center in West Palm Beach.<br>
<br>
Years after &quot;Star Trek&quot; became a cult favorite, Nimoy learned that the ritual he was forbidden to observe invoked Shekhina, the feminine manifestation of God. The V-shaped hand gesture represents the Hebrew character shin, the first letter of Shekhina's name.<br>
<br>
Mystical tradition<br>
<br>
According to Jewish mystical tradition, she is so awesome that humans might not survive the sight of her. The revelation gave direction to work Nimoy was doing with the female form.<br>
<br>
His photographs attempt to capture the goddess, Nimoy said.<br>
<br>
Looking well-tailored, lean and youthful, Nimoy, 71, said, &quot;I decided to explore, if possible, everything I could think of about the feminine experience, including pregnancy and birth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Most of the photographed figures are nude or partially nude. The models often wear filmy robes, and sometimes prayer shawls or phylacteries, a prayer accessory that wraps around one arm.<br>
<br>
The black-and-white images are marked by strong contrasts in lights and darks. The figures appear in natural settings, framed by woods, sea or sky, or in an indeterminate zone inhabited only by their bodies and the light.<br>
<br>
Nimoy says he uses light in the same way that Old Masters such as Rembrandt did. The light-dark dichotomy relates to poles such as good and evil and materialism versus spirituality, he said.<br>
<br>
The photographs have incensed some Jewish leaders, who object to his adorning female nudes with Jewish ritual objects. In Seattle and Detroit, his appearances for Jewish organizations were canceled. The events were relocated to other venues, where they were well-attended, he said.<br>
<br>
Nimoy said he was &quot;nonplussed&quot; by the cancellations. &quot;Because one or two loud voices were raised, several hundred people who wanted to see my work were being told they couldn't,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Nimoy speculated that the objections to his work may stem from attitudes about the proper place of women in Judaism. &quot;It's all about territory,&quot; he said. &quot;The book has been seen as elevating women in the hierarchy. In Judaism, certain males are not comfortable with that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rabbi Isaac Jeret, spiritual leader of Temple Emanu-El in Palm Beach, has not seen Nimoy's work. But, he said, &quot;it would be unfair to characterize any denomination or practice as more or less egalitarian based on whether or not they approve of Mr. Nimoy's work.&quot;<br>
<br>
There were no objections from the 400 people who turned out to hear Nimoy's talk at Temple Israel in West Palm Beach, said Howard Shapiro, the temple's rabbi.<br>
<br>
&quot;People who came and saw his art, especially when they saw the images at the Armory, were quite taken by the power of the photographs,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Nor has the Armory received any complaints, said Amelia Ostrosky, executive director. The 100 guests at the reception &quot;didn't think it was at all offensive,&quot; she said. &quot;They understood the interpretation and were very impressed by it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Book selling well<br>
<br>
The book, his first photographic monograph, is selling well.<br>
<br>
The 6,000-copy first edition has been succeeded by a 4,000-volume second edition. The artist is represented by galleries in New York and Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
Nimoy learned photography in his teens. In the 1970s, burned out from his television and movie work, he resumed his studies and considered switching careers to commercial photography.<br>
<br>
In addition to his on-camera work, Nimoy has directed several films, including two &quot;Star Trek&quot; features, &quot;The Good Mother&quot; and &quot;Three Men and a Baby.&quot;<br>
<br>
He and his wife, Susan, have homes in Los Angeles, Lake Tahoe and New York. Susan was the model for some of the &quot;Shekhina&quot; images, including the book's final photograph of a woman's upturned face.<br>
<br>
Nimoy said he is finished with the &quot;Shekhina&quot; series. His next project may be even more abstract than documenting an invisible deity.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm considering an essay on the subject of time,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm in the final phase of my life. I'm told by actuarial tables that I have 5,642 days left to live.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've got myself a countdown clock that will tick down my days for me. I find it exhilarating to mark that time so that I use it, explore it and value it. If I'm conscious of it, I'm less likely to let it slip by unnoticed.&quot;<br>

Just kidding.  <br>
<br>
I had no clue about any of this stuff.  I never even made the connection before between the Vulcan symbol and the letter shin.  I do agree that they look similar.  The shin looks kind of like a funky W.  The letter, not the president, lol.  I'm guessing that this has to do with the Kabbalah which is Jewish mysticism, and not the traditional Jewish practice.  Then again, I'm not the most observant Jew in the world, so there is definitely some stuff that I'm missing in that arena.  I do know that both Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner are Jewish, so I guess it wouldn't suprise me too much if something from the show was zapped from Judaism.  I do think this whole thing is kind of funny, but then again, I'm kind of a sicko who finds humor in strange things.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't know if some of the angry Jews had a problem with elevating a woman like the original article suggested, or just the fact that pictures of naked chicks were being displayed and associated with Judaism.  &quot;Fundy&quot; Jews don't necessarily tend to look down on women, they just see men and women as having distinct roles that they need to stick with.  At least that is what some Orthodox claim in order to keep from ticking people off.  Anyway, I found this to be an interesting little lesson.  Who'd a thought that a Muslim would teach me so much about Judaism.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
