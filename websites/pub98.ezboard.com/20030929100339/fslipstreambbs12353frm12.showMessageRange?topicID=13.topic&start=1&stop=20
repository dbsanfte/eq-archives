Pirates and thieves, each and every one of them and ever since the destruction of the mineral-rich planets that used to be in Tyrant space, the entire region was out for Tyrants.  <br>
<br>
A woman couldn’t even make a living anymore and none of her old contacts would even speak to her.  Some of them had even jumped on the DK/FTA bandwagon in order to collect the bounty that now existed on her head and any other Tyrant.  So much for the cargo running business.<br>
<br>
Still, there were new contacts to make in this region of space.. And even though the FTA was still a dominant force, they didn’t have the stranglehold they did in Tyrant Space at the end.  Cait had always known Tyrants had settled too damn close to Drago-Kazov space, it was like a carrot sitting there, someone was bound to want to pluck it out of space sooner or later.   Cait shudder remembering the end on Idun!<br>
<br>
So much destruction and for what; we had won the battle and lost our homes and livelihood in the process.  And lost so many people.. So many people either missing or dead..  Cait shook her head again and tried to put the past in the past where it belonged.  It did no good to live there, when the present and the future were all that mattered. <br>
<br>
Cait made the last jump and came out at the right coordinates, just as planned.  There were 2 slip fighters waiting for her to escort her to the fleet.  Thank the progenitor himself for that, she had been successful in making 3 runs for money and profit and then purchased the needed supplies, food and technology.  <br>
<br>
However, she had been unsuccessful in gathering any information about a possible site to settle. All she could gather from her new contacts was that it would be better for Tyrants to keep on moving out of this region and into the next.  While most were delighted to trade with Cait, they made it clear that should Tyrants decide to stay for any length of time, that would change abruptly. <br>
<br>
HeroicFool and the other Captains wouldn’t be pleased; they’d hoped to find a temporary base around here.  The ships needed to stop consuming so much fuel and rebuild.  They needed repairs. Oh the list just went on… Now Cait had to tell them all, that they had to keep moving… or risk an attack that they were not prepared to win.<br>
<br>
The fighters signaled Cait as the fleet appeared in the distance.  Hidden behind a gas giant to avoid detection, the cargo bay of ‘The Sardaria’ opened up and the Mog Ruith safely landed … the fighters then circled around to return to their ship.<br>
<br>
Cait quickly shut down and opened the cargo bay doors to the Mog, motioning for the load to be unloaded, inventoried and stored immediately.  There were lots of requests and they had to be prioritized.  It just never ended these days.  There was never enough food and supplies to go around, but somehow they seemed to make it.  <br>
<br>
Cait comm’ed HF and told him she was back… and that she would have her report in an hour.  She could have given it then, but she was tired and so dirty… she just wanted to clean up first.  The bad news could wait.<br>
<br>
Cait walked the distance to the main junction and then took a lift to the deck where her quarters were located...... arriving at her quarters, to find it empty.. She wondered where Declan was, but decided to clean up before she hunted him down.  He was probably with the other children or maybe with HF.  <br>
<br>
Cait quickly got out of her clothes and cleaned her body as best she could with the water she had saved from Declan’s bath. What she wouldn’t do for a nice long hot shower…  <br>
<br>
After cleaning up, she donned clean fatigues, black of course… She looked at herself in the mirror and tried to fix her too long, blonde hair back out of her face.  I was useless, it was too long, so she just braided it back out of her face.  One last look in the mirror, she certainly wasn’t a fashion plate, but then she never had been… At least her fatigues were clean!<br>
<br>
Cait left quickly on her way to command to make her report........</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

LoP sat at the chessboard and scanned the pieces. Of course, he wasn't physically sitting at a chessboard but it was real in his mind as he reviewed possibilites. He wasn't sure why he seemed to center around the Tyrant Pride's future, but he accepted what &quot;fate&quot; had decided. <br>
<br>
He had sensed the destruction during the time he had been injured and missing, but he had been unable to help out. Now he was back. Of coure getting a Tyrant to listen was the real challange since they tended to believe in their own ability to control life.<br>
<br>
LoP smiled to himself as he thought of anyone believing they had total control over their own life. Sure, they had some input but never full control. Even Trancers didn't have full control. All he could do was look at possibilties and try to steer people in the right general direction.<br>

Caitriona was overdue, again.  That woman was never on time.   HF forgave her that regularly since she always showed up in one piece and with the mission accomplished to his satisfaction.  He'd never admit that his worry for her was the cause for so many of his grisly moods these days.  Still the people of command knew that When Cait was away they'd better stay below the General's radar.<br>
<br>
HF shook his head at his foolishness.  Even in his thoughts he still referred to himself as the General of the Elites.  It was a weakness, a vanity that he despised in himself.  Nightfall commanded the Elite Tyrants now. Even though he had relinquished the title and the responsibility for leading the Elites, she had yet to take the title for herself.

The Matriarch council claimed she was ready, that she had earned her ship.  She had sensed their approval of her chosen name for the vessel and of her challenge.  With the devastation of Idun, the Tyrants' need for allies had become manifest.  The time had come for causal kinship.  Thus the Hetupratyaya, thus Sunyata.  They had accepted her rescue and her help, up to a point.  After all, it was a question of survival.  Whether or not they would accept her, in all of her Wolverineness, remained to be seen.  For now, she would focus on rescue and defense and hope that the Tyrants would recognize the wisdom in this choice.  As Master Sun wrote, &quot;Defense is for times of insufficiency, attack is for times of surplus.&quot;  The responses to Cait's trading efforts had provided abundant demonstration of the insufficiency of the times.  Still, they were a proud people and bound to resent needing her aid.  Sunyata absently tucked a strand of her chin length, chestnut hair behind her ear.  A vision of tranquility in turmoil, she rubbed her bone-bladeless forearms and scanned the sensor logs for the telltale signs of other Tyrant survivors.  She thanked the All for leading her to LT before the life support systems failed on the damaged freighter now sitting in one of the Hetupratyaya's cargo bays.  She had much work ahead of her securing and defending the survivors of Idun.  LT was already proving a superb XO.  The All willing, the rest of the Tyrants would eventually trust her.  In the meantime she could draw strength from the advice of Master Lao, &quot;Act through nonaction, / Handle affairs through noninterference, / Taste what has no taste, / Regard the small as great, the few as many, / Repay resentment with integrity.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Let the All's will be my will,&quot; she chanted inaudibly as she continued her search.<br>

Twice in her lifetime now she had been displaced. The first time she had only been 10 when she had been sent to live with Blade just before the attack on the Tigré pride. Then, just as she was settling into a life with her new family~Tyrants~their home of Idun was destroyed. Had it not been for  Sunyata finding her and her son Orion and Terri before their oxygen ran out....She stopped short of finishing that thought.<br>
<br>
They still hadn't found XT, second to the Alpha. He had put her and her son and Terri onto the freighter and Sca and her children onto another ship before heading back out himself. That was the last she had seen of him, but she was still hopeful that he would be found safe and sound. She still missed him dearly and hopefully Orion wouldn't be grown before they found him again.<br>
<br>
She still couldn't quite get the name of this vessel out without getting her tongue tangled up, so had taken to calling it the Hetu. It had been her home since Sunyata found her floating helplessly. Most of the stuff fron her shop had been stored on board when things on Idun got bad and there were more important things than clothes needed. She had used her shop as a distribution point for rationing supplies to keep the Tyrants from starving during the last days.<br>
<br>
Shaking herself out of her reverie, she got up and made her way towards command. Terri watched Orion for her so she never worried about him. This was the first time she had been assigned to be XO and she did her best to do a good job. She also had a feeling that she was supposed to keep an eye on Sunyata, but the woman had been above board in everything that LT had observed, so she was beginning to trust that she was genuine and had said as much to the others.<br>

She slowed her pace and envisioned Declan safe in his father’s arms.. This vision alone brought a smile to Cait’s face every time and brought her heart such joy when she actually saw them together.  Truly life for Tyrants was all about the appreciation of one’s family, for what else really matters in the end.<br>

In the wake of the destruction of Idun one thing had become increasingly apparent to Cait, her love for HF and her son.  These two precious people, rode with her on missions and brought her back safely each and ever time.  <br>

Cait shook herself out of her reverie and picked her pace back up, she was late—again!!!  He hated it when she was late and she always was.  One of the leftovers from her single days.. She actually hated accounting to anyone for anything---especially her time.  Some people say Cait has problems with authority….. And they would be right.

He'd been sending scouts out constantly, searching for rumors, clues, leads of any kind on possible places for them to settle.....abandoned outposts, uninhabited worlds, played out asteroid mines......anything that would sustain them, and be far from their many enemies.<br>
<br>
He dropped into the center chair and sighed. He felt very much like the man he was named for.....well, not the 'man'. Richard Gideon had been an avatar, the embodiment of the warship the Matriarch of his old Pride, the Raven, had commanded during the Nietzschean uprising of the old Commonwealth. That ship had been destroyed, but the Matriarch had sent Gideon to protect and watch over her Pride, who were loyal to the Commonwealth, from reprisals by the rebel Prides. He had gathered them together and guided them to a world where they could thrive, safe and hidden from the chaos.....and now, here he was, obstensibly doing the very same thing: seeking a world where the Tyrants could live in safety and security. <br>
<br>
The analogy evoked the thought that perhaps his old Pride's homeworld might be just what they needed....but it also provoked emotions that squeezed his heart painfully. He was not sure he could bear looking on his home again; not after seeing the destruction that had been laid upon it by an unknown aggressor, wiping out his Pride and all he had known. He had not returned to that world since, and figured he never would. No, there was great risk in bringing the Pride there...someone knew of it's existence, someone with no compunctions about slaughtering Nietzscheans, to the last woman and child....and he could never be certain they would not return.<br>
<br>
The thought of children sent his mind deep into the bowels of the ship, to the medical ward and his wife, Raeven, who was very near to giving birth to their first child. Pride and affection filled him, at it always did when he thought of her and the family they would build together. His love for Raeven was most un-Nietzschean like; not the cold, rational realization that it was simply a reaction of genetic coding, evolutionary responses designed to promote reproduction. No, he would do anything for her, sacrifice all he was to keep her safe, protect her and their child. He could not imagine an existence without her. And, for the countless time, he gave a quiet laugh at the irony of mating a woman with a name virtually identical to that of the Pride he had lost.<br>
<br>
He rose to his feet, suddenly wanting very much to go see his mate. He handed the flexis to Scathach, his first officer.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

As her XO reviewed the updates scrolling across the computer screens in front of her, Sunyata took note of both the woman's fortitude and emotional control.  The missing members of her family and her pride obviously formed her most pressing concerns.  Watching her, Sunyata felt a momentary pang of longing for her own pride.  Brushing that feeling aside, she stood and walked toward LT's workstation.  Placing her hand lightly upon her XO's shoulder, she said, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Sometimes no news is good news; All willing, we'll find him soon.  In the meantime, I'll leave the search in your more than capable hands.  I want to see that the repairs on your freighter are progressing properly, check on the aeroponics production and finish the engineering details on the cloaking boosters before taking them to the Sardaria and the Ferocitas Invictus for installation.  I'll be visiting the AI interface, as well.  So if the Hetu seems a little preoccupied, it's just me.&quot; </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> LT and her family were the Hetupratyaya's only crew right now.  As they rescued more Tyrants, that number would surely increase and the big ship would finally begin to lose the aura of emptiness that had pervaded it since Sunyata had undertaken her mission.<br>
<br>
She exited control through the door that led to the Captain's ready room.  Once inside she placed her palm on a small control panel disguised as an architectural element and located high on one wall of the room.  She felt the sharp prick of DNA extraction and a previously seamless section of the wall vanished.  As Sunyata stepped through the portal, the wall returned to its solid state, leaving no sign of her passing.  She passed quickly through the hidden conduits which permitted her secret access to any part of her ship and into the Hetupratyaya's real control center, the Captain's AI interface.  She settled into the control couch and expanded her consciousness.  Almost immediately the connection took hold and she and her ship could act in concert.  With a thought, she entered the cargo bay and checked the freighter repairs.  They were almost complete; the Hetu should finish them in the next few hours.  Simultaneously, she examined aeroponics production and programmed enough of an increase to provide basic support for all the Tyrants rescued so far.  They might not need the supplies.  If they didn't need them, they could always trade them.  But Sunyata preferred to prepare; the All helps those who help themselves.  As she focused her attention on the cloaking boosters, Sunyata felt the Hetupratyaya demand more of her attention; her ship wanted to talk.  <br>

At one time such a image would have boggled her imagination, but Declan had grown up along side a Captain's chair.. First on the Mog with Cait and now along side his father on 'The Sardaria'. His tiny feet had hardly ever walked on solid ground at all.<br>
<br>
Cait enterd her security code and entered the office, sitting down at the consol to prepare her report for HF and the other Captains.  She included all the contacts she had made, any rumors she had picked up, along with any traders sympathetic to trading with Tyrants.  A compelte list of all her contacts would be forwarded to each ship in the fleet so that if any Tyrants had to re-enter this space again, they could be reasonably sure of a friendly contact.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;...... and  a total of 5 new contacts were made that appear to be open to trade and doing busines with Tyrant cargo runners.  Two of them have contacts to technology and could be a valuable resource for the Engineer.  <br>
<br>
........The star maps to the 2 planets rich in food supplies and minerals are attached to this report, but be cautious, bounty hunters know we need food.<br>
<br>
According to the other traders I contacted, there are no known abandoned asteroids or vacant drifts..... However, this could have been a lie. I got the impression there was more to it; that perhaps there was a drift, but that it was over run with pirates.  <br>
<br>
........ and in conclusion, in my opinion, even if a vacant drift or asteroid could be settled, we would still have several problems with traders and mercenerices in this region.  While I learned that the FTA does not have a monopoly, they do have agents in the area.  We take a great risk, if we stay here for too long.  One, I feel we cannot afford to take at this point.<br>
<br>
Add to that the price on our heads and my recommendation is to run as many missions as we can to secure the supplies we need and have the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ferocitas Invictus</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> look for a home base further out--staying ahead of the fleet.<br>

Declan always wanted to come this way, he loved running, even though he wasn't yet an accomplished walker as of yet.  <br>
<br>
The massive arboretum was the perfect place as far as his son was concerned.  It was as close to a planetary eco-system as could be made with modern engineering.  HF wondered at the manpower and the technology required to make the place work.  The ship had its own hydroponics bay for growing essential medicines and food, but this place was bigger, more varied in it's plant life and it even had small wildlife.  A miniature bio-dome he had heard someone remark as he discovered the place for the first time.  It contained almost everything that several planets had to offer in the way of plant life.  HF prized be this room because he knew that with it the Tyrant Pride would live on, not lacking for air or food as long as the place was maintained.  It would never be able to provide all the food that his people needed, but without it there was no way that the pride would have enough resources to trade just to keep themselves fed, let alone keep the ships fueled and in working order.  <br>
<br>
Declan prized the gigantic room because the ground was soft, there was dirt everywhere, (the boy DID love his dirt) and he was fascinated by the little animals, from the honey bees to the little tree frogs.  HF gazed on proudly as the child fell yet again, in the process biting his tongue.  The boy climbed slowly to his feet, eyes tearing with the pain, but he didn't cry out.  He stood there for a moment keeping the tears back, then he was off running again.<br>
<br>
He was a tough one, his energy was boundless and nothing daunted him for a second, even at this tender age.  Declan was, however, making the trip from command to his office a slow one.  Still HF would never dream of weakening his son by carrying him even when he was so impatient to see his mother.<br>
<br>
It had been a longer mission than usual...<br>
<br>
Then it started to rain.  HF scowled at the small clouds gathering overhead, but his son's joy soon melted his irritation, then they were both laughing as the dirt turned to mud and the boy had an even harder time staying upright.  <br>
<br>
Finally, soaked, they arrived at the airlock leading from the arboretum to the hallway that would take him to his quarters and his private office.  No one was allowed access to either except his wives, his progeny and himself.  HF loved the complete privacy these rooms afforded him and his family.  They were truly the only places he felt he could really relax completely.  Safely beyond the eyes of the crew, those plotting against him, those admiring him from afar...  he could truly be himself.<br>
<br>
HF entered his code, his fingerprints were scanned as he pushed the keys in the correct sequence then compared to the small group allowed access.  Instantaneously, the door opened smoothly and silently.<br>
<br>
The place was quiet.<br>
<br>
HF sent Declan into the living quarters to play as he headed to his office to find his sleeping beauty.<br>
<br>
Slinking up on her silently, HF kissed her soft lips gently as any prince would be obliged to so if he saw such a woman sleeping as Caitriona was just then...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heroicfool>HeroicFool</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://avatarshere.topcities.com/p/explosionwer.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/21/03 7:35:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=consubstantial>consubstantial</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/examples/fhpp036.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=purple, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='user title'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table><a

She nestled her forearms more deeply into the couch and felt the material encircle them.  In an instant connections formed between the ship and the biological interfaces tucked discretely away at the base of her normally hidden bone blades.  Her experiences since her last connection downloaded quickly into the Hetu's memory and the Hetu's memories came just as quickly to her.  The Hetu's AI took form as a familiar holographic image.  A gift from the Matriarch's council . . . the ability to see herself as others saw her.  She thought not a little wryly about what a pain in the ass she was.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure about giving the Tyrants these cloaking boosters?&quot;  Hetu asked<br>
<br>
&quot;It is an offer, with limitations.  I have to do something to build trust.&quot;  Sunyata retorted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Build trust?&quot;  Hetu snorted, &quot;Don't make me laugh.  I can already envision you making this offer to those two captains.  And their response.  But the All might surprise me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Conversations with oneself encourage introspection.  And Sunyata followed those thoughts where the All led her.  Today it was back in time to the day of decision, the day of action, the day of her election to this path a year and a half ago.  She sat again at a table near the back of the Matriarch's Council and listened to the members drone on about genetic combinations and mating patterns.  She would be a matter of discussion at one of these meetings soon, for her most recent offspring had reached the age and begun the fostering.  Soon she would again provide her genetic material for the good of the pride.  But Sunyata attended the meeting today for ethical reasons.  Her concern was the disposition of the matter of the Tyrants.  She grew agitated as she realized that the council intended to ignore the Tyrants' situation.  <br>
<br>
Finally she stood and addressed the Council, &quot;Matriarchs, we mustn't postpone action on the matter of the Tyrants.  They need our help.  We have an ethical obligation.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Chair silenced her with a bang of the gavel.  &quot;The All helps those who help themselves, Sunyata.  If the Tyrants demonstrate their ability to handle their problem, they may prove ready for our intervention.  Otherwise they are not fit to mingle their genes with ours.&quot;<br>
<br>
She recalled striding right up to the Chair's platform, turning to face the council and stating, &quot;With all due respect, Madame Chair, that's bullshit.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Several of the members half stood themselves aghast at her gall.  The Chair banged her gavel again.  &quot;Order,&quot; she said, &quot;I have decided to exercise a prerogative of the Chair.  We will hear Sunyata out.  Tell us Sunyata.  What makes them already worthy of our aid?  What has every one of us failed to consider?&quot;<br>
<br>
Thank the All she wasn't easily intimidated she thought as she faced the council squarely and began to lay out her case.  She built it on martyrdom.  If the pride was capable of producing martyrs, it was worthy of consideration.  It was an old, old criteria, long out of use; but the only one she could find to justify moving the intervention forward.  She had seen the pattern of martyrdom emerge among the Tyrants.  If the Wolverines were not prepared to offer the All's aid to the Tyrants in the aftermath of their ethical affirmation, the Wolverines would fail in their duty to the All.  If the Matriarch Council refused to act now to prepare to help, they would instead help seal the Tyrants' doom.<br>
<br>
Into the silence following her arguments, the Chair asked, &quot;Do you accept the responsibility for this choice?  Do you accept responsibility for the Tyrants?&quot;<br>
<br>
The questions sounded across the room like a death knell.  That was her only real inkling of where her answer would head her.  &quot;Yes.&quot;  She said.  No elaboration, no qualification.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So be it;&quot; the Chair responded.  &quot;You assembled here today have heard Sunyata plead the case that we give aid and accept responsibility for the Tyrants.  In response to that plea, I hand down the following decision.  Construction of her ship shall begin today.  Sunyata has accepted responsibility for the Tyrants; to her falls the task of aiding and teaching them and, All willing, bringing them to the fold.  She shall leave from this room and at once begin the procedure of melding.  If any Matriarch present feels any dissent with this decision, let her speak now.&quot;  The room was silent; the only sound Sunyata could hear was her own breathing until the Matriarch said, &quot;So mote it be.&quot;<br>
<br>
The finality of that statement brought here back to the present.  &quot;Enough internal dialectic,&quot; she told the Hetu.  &quot;I'm offering the cloaking boosters.  Are they finished?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A few moments ago,&quot; Hetu responded.  &quot;Shall I hail the other ships?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not yet, I'll do it from command.  I want LT to know what I have in mind.&quot;  Sunyata felt the connections withdraw from the interfaces and rose from the control couch.  She retracted her bone blades and smoothed the skin that kept them a secret from the other prides.  Slipping quietly through the hidden conduits she made her way back to the Captain's ready room.  From there she exited directly onto the bridge.<br>

<br>
&quot;LT, I want you to send a communique to the Sardaria and the Ferocitas Invictus.  I'd like you to invite them, their XO's and their families to the Hetupratyaya for dinner and counsel.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seeing the unasked question in her XO's eyes, she continued, &quot;I've completed the engineering, development and production of the cloaking boosters.  I intend to offer them for use, if the ship captains want them.  Terri can watch Orion and the rest of the children while we discuss the future.  Will you extend the invitation?  I'm counting on you to get them here, LT.  In the meantime, I'm going to see to the arrangements.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Sunyata hesitated a moment to see if LT had any concerns or questions before leaving Command to begin the preparations.<br>

 After she finishes going over the flexis her thoughts turn to the events that led up to her and her childrens' current situation.She could clearly remember that fateful day when her Pride was attacked by Flynn Aragona's.Since many of the Pride were fighting the battle in the air she was left leading a force of teenagers that she had trained in the arts of combat in order to protect the Pride on land.Eventhough she had made a promise to her mate XT that she would no longer put her life at risk by fighting she lead her small band of warriors after she saw the stark fear on their young faces and she couldn't let them face possible death alone.Sadly,her small band was no match for their enemy -Sca was left wounded and all her students who idolized her and fought so very fiercely by her side perished.<br>
 XT found Sca lying wounded among the bodies of her fallen students and quickly tended to her wounds then carried her to where her twin brother Kieran who was the Alpha of Panther Pride-who fought along side the Tyrants,was waiting with her children.Then after hugging and kissing the children and then Sca-XT put them all on a small ship ,told Sca to follow the remainder of the Pride and that some how,some way he would find them.Kieran had vowed to keep XT safe and make sure that he would return to her,LT and the children very soon.<br>
 Soon after she and the children were found and rescued by Richie and his wife Raeven and Sca became Richie's XO.Sca performed her duties precisely and methodically,her face was always a calm mask devoid of any emotion-the only indication of what was below the surface was the pained and haunted look in her doe brown eyes.The only time she ever showed any emotion was when she was with her children.<br>
 As Sca remembers she wonders what Richie would think if he knew that his XO had who seemed to have it all together on the outside actually had a tremulous grip on her emotions. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=scathach@slipstreambbs12353>Scathach</A> at: 2/22/03 2:12:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raeven@slipstreambbs12353>Raeven</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#0000ff, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 722<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/24/03 10:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.freeavatars.net/vpimages/reggoofy/fhrgmk108.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Displaced ~ Tyrant RP (Rated R)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Rae tried to lean into her husbands embrace...she laughed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
