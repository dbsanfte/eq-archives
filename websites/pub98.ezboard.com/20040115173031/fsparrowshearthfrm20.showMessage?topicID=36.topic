<br>
I have not seen an episode of 7th Heaven that was this good in a long, long, long, long time!  Probably not since the second season and the show is now in it's eighth season.<br>
<br>
This is my second favorite episode now, only because I don't think anything can beat my favorite episode &quot;It's About George&quot; which was in the first season.<br>
<br>
I've been saying on 7th Heaven message boards, including my own, for years that they need to do an episode on the topic of sexual abuse.  Never in my dreams had I imagined it to be this good.<br>
<br>
If you don't want to read about what happened in this episode, do not read further.  You've been warned.<br>
<br>
The first half of the episode confused me.<br>
<br>
It began with Eric trying to talk a principal into bending her rules for a family.  I'm still not sure exactly what the rule was.  But it involved a brother picking up his sister.  The brother graduated high school last year and his sister is a senior this year.  She wouldn't bend.  She said the rules were made by the district.  Eric said something like, &quot;But aren't rules made to be broken?&quot;<br>
<br>
Then I loved her reaction to the minister.  She said something to the effect of, &quot;Should the Ten Commandments be broken?  What about the Golden Rule?&quot;  Eric was speechless to respond to that.<br>
<br>
Truth being, this family Eric was trying to help, she was trying to help in another way.  She suspected abuse.<br>
<br>
But right after Eric talked with her, he walked out into the hall and saw her talking to a kid who is his new neighbor, Martin.  Martin told Eric that he really liked the principal, that she was nice and fair and that though her rules were tough, it meant everyone was treated equally.  But he was the only one with this impression of her.  Suddenly, rumors started coming out, all sorts of horrible rumors about the principal.  One, Martin really wasn't a teenager, he was older and she had brought him in as a spy to spy on the other kids and report back to her things like who had drugs and so on.  Parents were also saying bad things about her.<br>
<br>
Eric didn't know what to believe, he went to tell Annie about the rumors he had been hearing, but when she asked her husband before he told her where he had heard it from and he told her from students, she told him he'd better not tell her.  Which was mature of her since teenagers will make up lots of things.<br>
<br>
But the way things were going, during the first half of the episode, I was believing that the older brother had been sexually abusing his sister, because the principal was refusing to let him come on campus to pick up his sister (or something like that).<br>
<br>
I missed the hints that were being dropped.  In a conversation between Eric's daughter Lucy and her husband Kevin, she told Kevin about this family which lived down the street - big yellow house, the sun was always sitting out in his car in front of the house looking like he was asleep.  When Kevin arrived on school ground to find the principal standing next to the guy's car talking to him, Kevin was ready to write a ticket, but the principal didn't seem to want them involved.<br>
<br>
Kevin's partner Roxanne looked up his license plate to find many outstanding traffic tickets.  So he was picked up by the police so he wasn't there to pick up his sister after school.  The sister came to the principal to say her brother wasn't there, clearly she was worried, and the principal asked her to talk about what was really going on.<br>
<br>
Then the moment I realized it wasn't the brother was when Eric arrived at the high school to find several police officers and his good friend Det. Michaels standing there with the girl's father.  He was told that because the police picked up his son, he wasn't there to pick up his daughter.  She had been seen leaving with the principal, so now there was a warrant for the principal.  Eric then listened to the man say how it was important for his son to pick up his daughter because she was so mad that her parents wouldn't let her go away to school next year that she was capable of making up awful lies about the family.  He kept repeating this to Eric which was the moment I realized it was the father trying to hide the truth of what he was doing to his daughter.<br>
<br>
But then came one of the best scenes in 7th Heaven history imho.  A social worker came out to inform the father that his daughter was in protective custody and that she was there to interview him.  The father was trying to blow it off, threatening them in fact, until his son came running at them.  His son, angry and tears started yelling at his father.  Loud enough for all of them to hear, he let it be known that he had been told that it had just been him, that his father had been abusing only him, he had no idea that his dad was doing it to his younger sister as well.  He said that he would always sit out in his car in front of the house when his dad was home because he didn't want to go in and face him.  With so much emotion, he yelled at his father that he wanted to kill him and started to approach his dad, though Det. Michaels held him back.<br>
<br>
That night, the brother waited outside a room where his sister was talking with the social worker and her mother was in there and possibly someone else.  Her mother also had lots of problems.  Out in the hall, Eric sat with her brother and counseled him as he talked some more about the pain, mostly that he didn't want anyone to know and how his father had always told him it was his fault, he was stupid and an accident and what not.  And in the end, it was Eric who helped get them each to a safe place to live.  The girl to a foster home, the guy to somewhere else, since the girl was adament that she didn't want to go home with her mother.<br>
<br>
It was just one of those episodes that was so good, it had me in tears at the end.  I had tears from the moment the brother came running at his dad in front of the high school to the end.  I hope you guys saw it.  If not, catch it on a re-run.  It was soooooo good! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>
