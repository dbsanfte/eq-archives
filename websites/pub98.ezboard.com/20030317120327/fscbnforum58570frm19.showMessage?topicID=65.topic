<br>
The statement had been delivered in the same tone that he had always used, the Georgia accent untainted by emotion or stress. Even ten years after being released from her sire’s hunting glances, she remembered. <br>
<br>
She could recall his neatly trimmed beard and mustache, red flecked with gray. The formal dress shirt, always worn with cufflinks, the dove gray tailored jacket. Standing with his hands clasped informally behind his back, his every glance and movement betraying his contempt of those around him.<br>
<br>
Even after ten years. She remembered and felt the heat rise on her cheeks.<br>
<br>
“The large majority seems to think my place is with a stake between my ribs.”<br>
<br>
“You only have yourself to blame for that, Justice.”<br>
<br>
A pity, that a vampire cannot cry.<br>
<br>
“If this clan-mate was really a vile as you claim, it should not have been at all difficult to get permission of the sixth on him. Then, he would still be disposed of. And you wouldn’t be running.”<br>
<br>
The utter determination rose in her gut. “I’m not running.” Her voice breathy over the public telephone as she swallowed her tears. “I’m relocating.”<br>
<br>
“Really?” His voice was slow, and Justice could just picture a half-smirk on his infuriating face, an eyebrow going up. “I’d like to know just what sort of place you expect to relocate to, now that a city, so controversial among the Camarillia that it might as well be Anarch, has kicked you out.”<br>
<br>
“They didn’t kick me out.” Justice gave a short smile of minimal satisfaction at this, more like a baring of teeth against the encroaching darkness. “A friend told me it might be a good idea for me to leave.” The unfamiliar word started the thoughts circling in her head, though. Someone had betrayed her to Nikka. Who did she know that was really a friend anymore? Thomas, Calith, Ali, Laura? Were there any she could trust?<br>
<br>
The memory came to her with startling clarity for about two seconds: an old Ventrue acquaintance of hers. ‘Friends—better to buy too many and be left busy than to buy too little and be left dead.’<br>
<br>
Was Calith dead? No way to tell, now. And what about little Marissa? Could Thomas protect her from whatever Brujah was elevated to primogen in her place?<br>
<br>
“Then it’s sheer folly to return.” For how old he sounded, the man ought to be a lot closer to Caine. Could you raise the potency of your blood by sheer arrogance? Justice had full conviction in the idea that if such a thing could be done, her sire would have done it by now.<br>
<br>
“I know.”<br>
<br>
“Which means you’re going to go it anyway.”<br>
<br>
“It doesn’t concern you.” A silence entered the conversation, of medium length.<br>
<br>
“No, you’re right. It doesn’t.”<br>
<br>
Justice had a distinct feeling of foreboding, that Kevin McGovern Jr., her esteemed sire and a respected professor at the University of California Berkeley, was either about to disinherit her or hang up the phone. Or both. But then he began to speak again.<br>
<br>
“It doesn’t. But if you’re going to get yourself killed, do us all a favor and stay out of the Bay Area when you do it.” And then he hung up.<br>
<br>
Justice sighed as she hung up the receiver and climbed back on her motorcycle. She touched her forehead to the cool metal of the handlebars for just a minute, trying to let the tension flow out of her neck and shoulders. She wasn’t sure if she had served any purpose at all by calling Kevin and telling him of her plight. Perhaps at most it had given her an impetus to action.<br>
<br>
She found the nearest highway entrance around the outskirts of Watsonville, and started heading the general direction of South. All the bad little vampires ran south, always, when they were booted. And in any case, if she were truly courting death, as Mr. McGovern seemed eager to believe, she wanted to see the Joshua trees of the desert before she died.<br>
<br>
Really, she ought to call him again and leave a message of thanks on the old bastard’s answering machine. There was nothing like a little iron-clad practicality to shred good-hearted rebellion and idealism into far-flung bloody chunks.<br>

<br>
It’s bare, stark, naked almost in the postmodern sense. In the middle of the night one can almost imagine that it is the asphalt carpet the four horsemen will ride: that it is a tribute to the ultimate chaos. Not anarchy or dissolution or fundamental dissonance, but…nothing. Simply that, nothing. The absence of all that is vibrancy and life.<br>
<br>
It leaves ample space for dark thoughts.<br>
<br>
Juanita: the way her hair, long and thick and curly and always touched with dew from the fog, would smother you when she came close, would grasp you and hold you tight with the smell of rain and stars. Her body, perfect elegance—controlled power in the movement of every muscle. Her lips, black cherries, and as intoxicating as a good Merlot. She was the kind of woman that could make you remember what love was like, embodied it as the simplest sweetness that came before the heady onrush of something darker.<br>
<br>
My Fire Girl, my baby. The images were coming back to her on this darkly oppressive highway, suddenly, like the flashes of the pig’s lights on weathered brick had. Stark moments of color, of panic, of sweat and emotion that rose like a forest fire and painted the blood acrid. The feelings were ancient: sex and adrenaline, passion and pain. It reappeared in a rush, unfolded itself from the back of her mind, the first time she had seen the chola. Dark-eyed women not-huddling in the alleyway, women that were still little girls’ deep inside.<br>
<br>
The relationship had been deceptively simple to establish. Justice had connected them to customers from CSU Los Angeles that might want the smack they peddled and kept the eyes of the local pigs turned nicely away. In return, Justice was on-hand as the gang began to make more money, moving from smack to crack to angel dust. They began to get what little notoriety they could hold onto in the dog eat puppy world they had chosen. Predictably, none of the girls actually saved the money—it went into 40’s and guns and lazy vatos that promised, someday, they would take care of the Girls and of course never did.<br>
<br>
Only Juanita had wanted more. They used to go up on the overpass together, and Justice would watch Juanita get drunk and Juanita had learned enough by this time never to ask why Justice didn’t touch the alcohol or drugs or convenience store food, or was never even seen during the daytime. They sat together, and they would talk, and in the summer the desire was stifling. But Juanita never asked and so Justice never tasted her, never sipped from the magic fount that was her veins, though sometimes she went dizzy from the proximity of the perfume of her skin.<br>
<br>
There was nowhere to go after that. The memories fell down and on top of each other like little dominos, one triggering the other until all in a row the next wave came. Gently spurting blood on the swift brown hands, the involuntary tears slicking the cheeks and sparking the asthmatic breathing, the large pupils that seemed to cower in the sight of approaching death. The blood-stained hands clenching so tight, as if, with only gritted teeth and concentration, she could keep her soul in her body.<br>
<br>
“Yo sé que tu eres una bruja. Me ayudas…”<br>
<br>
Wordlessly, Justice had bit her wrist and held it out to Juanita. Immediately it turned violent. Juanita sucked the vitae so hard it felt as her capillaries were turning inside out—it had brought back the time twenty years before with a vengeance, lying in Kevin’s arms and feeling as if this fluid were the only thing that brought substance to the world, utter starmilk. Justice sank her teeth into Juanita’s neck and smeared her abdomen in the blood of Juanita’s torn stomach and sank into the ecstasy of the Kiss like the arms of a past lover. She could feel Juanita’s fluttering heartbeat in her flesh, becoming slower and steadier, and then deeper and darker, and then gone.<br>
<br>
Back to a threadbare apartment then: a true rat-hole, more like a nest than any haven in the true sense of the word. To watch the creamy skin turn pale and see her clench her hands and moan in sleep unnaturally deep. To awaken, finally, with a look gently dazed as if she had been dealt a stunning hit between the eyebrows. To see her eyes open and wordlessly ask the question with the muted expectation of horror in her gaze, oh god, what have you done to me?<br>
<br>
“Juanita, mi amor. Usted es un vampiro.”<br>

I love each and every one of them! As for the request for more adversity--I'll see what I can do, but I'm not promising anything. She's kind of in a lull right now. But her past certainly holds plenty of turmoil, so I'll see what flashbacks I can work in.)<br>
<br>
Tired and hungry from battling the onslaught of her memories, Justice’s eyes are plastered open only by grim determination as she took the I-8 ramp from Highway 5. Her conversation with Kevin from a nightfall ago is still fresh in her mind—its innuendo and assumptions.<br>
<br>
Perhaps McGovern hasn’t realized that the only sensible place for her to go is San Diego. She can’t blame him for that, knowing his characteristic inability to remove his head from his ass. But she certainly isn’t about to enlighten the son of a bitch. The Marquis of San Diego is expecting her—and that is quite enough.<br>
<br>
The College Avenue exit presents itself with a flourish, as the lighted announcement board of the San Diego State Aztecs shows the pathway. It might seem deliberately of lower status, choosing to hold Court in the open square, just past the main entrance of the university, but anyone who is truly experienced with Anarchs should realize that this simply isn’t so. It is all about rebellion from oppression, and any way in which their message can be made known is gladly seized. A thumb in the eye of both the Sabbat and the Camarilla—call us children, please. Then you’ll be all the more surprised when we bite you.<br>
<br>
When she enters the square, it at first appears utterly deserted, the glass information dome of the Love Library glinting in the moonlight, the austere arrangements of stone benches and tree planters down the wide open stone corridor a tribute to order and discipline. But Justice knows well enough, from previous experience, that what actually rules here was an organized kind of unruliness, the most dangerous kind of all. Of course they have a sentry. He just hasn’t deigned to show himself yet.<br>
<br>
Then she notices the man in the dark trench coat leaning against the lamppost, smoking a cigarette.<br>
<br>
“You’re not blind.” He comments, as she approaches.<br>
<br>
“Not as far as vision goes.”<br>
<br>
“Excuse me the presumption, then. I was expecting someone far more dramatic.”<br>
<br>
“Who are you?”<br>
<br>
“Theodore Kazinsky, my dear dead lady. The town crier.”<br>
Despite the name, the vampire before her does not, at first glance, appear unkempt. His hair is short, dark and curly, a few strands escaping an old-fashioned fedora. His stature and presentation is clean-cut. The style is 1920’s, as is the crisp language. Perhaps he is indeed, or was once, Russian in origin—the figure is imposing without any directly noticeable attempt at being so, and his skin is on the whiter side of pale. “What exactly do you cry about?”<br>
<br>
“Everything.” The fedora is tilted back, and she can see his eyes in the lamplight, a darkly lined severe gray. Bloody tears cascade horrifyingly down his cheeks. She is breath-taken for a few moments before she realizes they are tattoos.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps not blind. But ignorant, she might be.”<br>
<br>
Quick to recover, she replies: “It’s a quality most people don’t usually recognize at first glance.”<br>
<br>
Kazinsky smiles, in a way that makes Justice sure that he has recognized all the possible responses to her previous comment and proclaimed them all legitimate. It is a smile of mild superiority, minced with a dash of satisfaction, and she recognizes it well.<br>
<br>
A good way to enter a city, pleasing the Herald, even if her intention is to leave, and soon.<br>
<br>
“Court will convene in about an hour. Have you established a Haven?”<br>
<br>
Justice nods, but Kazinsky must have caught the insecurity in the gesture, because he hands her a business card.<br>
<br>
“I suggest you travel here. The nightlife is a little noisy, but I’m certain you’re used to worse. The postal service is a little inefficient, but I promise no mad bombers will scatter your slumber. Get a little refreshment and return—we won’t scamper off without you.”<br>
<br>
Justice moistens her lips nervously. “Thank you.”<br>
<br>
“Don’t you worry about a thing, dear. Say hello to Chlöe for me—if it turns out to be one of her good days, that is.”<br>
<br>
The sound of his laughter follows her to her motorcycle, blending with the dangerous night.<br>

I originally had the intention to write a bunch of these over christmas break...don't know exactly how that one got tossed out the window...anyway, this one has been sitting on my computer for a little while. These posts are absolutely not present-day, they all happened while Justice was away from Santa Carla, I figured there was just some stuff I hinted towards that people might like to know, at least out of game. And when I'm done posting the back stuff, I'll probably repost her and Laura's jp's as well, just so I know what happened when...okay? Okay.)<br>
<br>
Like everything else in this town, the apartment building smells of cigarettes.<br>
<br>
Just in case she has estimated the personalities of the residents incorrectly, Justice cuts the engine and coasts the last block or so to the residence, even though there are no stirs visible from without that are indicative of the feelings of those therein. A little of the mystery is cleared up when she enters the romanesque parlor on the first floor—the small office has been smashed to pieces, and the glass doors and faux wood paneling have all been scratched almost beyond recognition. Justice feels a bit of self-confidence start to return: it appears that she has not estimated them wrongly at all. Perhaps everything will go just as planned.<br>
<br>
But then, any seer could tell you that this is a bad time, and place, to take an omen.<br>
<br>
She finds the elevator in much the same condition as the office, so she climbs the carpeted stairwell that smells of chlorine with caution, looking for anyone with an ounce of authority that might be able to point out the ropes to her here. It is not until she nears the eighth floor that she hears what might be the sounds of weeping, and it is not until she tops it that she sees the girl. Crying gently and holding a menthol cigarette.<br>
<br>
Tears and Cigarettes. As good a summarization as any for this mini-world, Justice supposes.<br>
<br>
“What’s the matter?” Justice asks the girl, and the girl, upon hearing the voice, starts—as if she’d prefer to jump in shock but has forgotten how.<br>
<br>
“Not a thing.” The girl replies nervously, in a voice slow, thin, tiny and not at all beautiful. It’s a beaten puppy of a voice, but then so is her visage. She wears a sleeveless, short, black wool dress that looks like a mockery of her pale, emaciated frame. Her nails are bitten, and her glances are darting. After looking quickly from Justice to the floor three times in succession, she takes a long drag from the menthol and holds it in while she seems to gather her strength. “Why do people always think that something has to be wrong for you to be crying? It doesn’t. It absolutely doesn’t. I think it’s just the silliest thing in the world. Sometimes things are sad, so I cry for them. Sometimes they are happy, so I smile for them. But they are never wrong.”<br>
<br>
Justice has an inspiration. “Are you Chlöe?”<br>
<br>
“Of course. And you’re Justice, because you know me.” Something must have struck Chlöe as funny in that statement, because she erupts in peals of giggles with the tear tracks still fresh down her cheeks.<br>
<br>
“I’m Justice. I’m not sure I know you. Maybe I know of you, though.” Somehow, Justice does not want to engage in her customary handshake with this strange creature.<br>
<br>
The girl’s gaze all of a sudden becomes hooded and wary. “Maybe you do.” Chlöe then takes a last, quick drag and snuffs out her cigarette on the carpet. “At least that’s what Theodore said when he spoke inside my head.” As fast as it had come, the guarded fear was gone, leaving in its place an expression of iron-clad neutrality. “Well, come. You’ll want a house before you go and meet the king.”<br>
<br>
“Do you live in this building as well?” Justice asks as they enter the fire exit and turn down the tiled hallway. The halls, like the lobby downstairs, continue the 80’s roman theme with mirrored walls and brass sconces.<br>
<br>
“Oh yes. Up on the top, where there are no nasty hallways. I hate hallways.”<br>
<br>
It is easy to see why. All along the mirrored hall, Chlöe casts no reflection.<br>
<br>
“Here you go.” The girl finally says, halting at one point in the hallway and backpedaling to an apparently random doorway. “I think Mrs. Berkowitz used to live here, but maybe she’s dead now. In any case, she’s not here. So if you burn the tea cozies, it’ll feel just like home.” With a ferocious kick that Justice is surprised to see from those scrawny legs, Chlöe kicks in the door and grins in a satisfied way. She turns smartly, and leaves Justice to her own private orientation.<br>
<br>
“Bon appétit, or something like that.”<br>

<br>
Justice cuts the engine on her motorcycle early and coasts into the parking lot that hides behind the bookstore at SDSU, sheltered by draping willows. The foliage muffles any sound that remains, hopefully. She does not wish to interrupt the already-progressing populace meeting more than is absolutely necessary. Anarchs can bite more viciously at times than the Camarilla, and might do so if one of the few traditions they respect is interrupted. In any case, Justice remembers the Marquis as being quick to punishment of all sorts: it would do well not to get on anyone’s bad side, not now, not when bad memories might still ache.<br>
<br>
She creeps into the back row of attending Kindred that are listening to the Marquis’ words. Public-service announcements from various quarters: Killings, apparently by members of the Sabbat, via raids from a stronghold in Mexico City. A bloodmobile, whose license has in the past been traced to Hunter activity, has been noticed during the day outside establishments that Kindred frequent, come nightfall. Report any unusual findings. Justice is glad she frequents the back row, where maybe the clueless look on her face isn’t evident to many of those around her. It used to be her practice during Populace in Santa Carla, as well, before in an acceptance born of desperation, she was made Primogen of her clan…<br>
<br>
A familiar voice rings out over the crowd. Justice is startled from her thoughts by it, and recognizes the Town Crier, assembled at the front, with the rest of the House of Lords. “We have a new attendee joining us tonight. Or perhaps I should say a new courtier, a new member of court, bereft of land or title.” Perhaps his voice is more mellifluous than it ought to be, carries better to every corner of the audience. “Justice always seems to come to us in times of trouble.” Snickers from the Lords.<br>
<br>
There are a few of the assembled that she recognizes, but more that she does not. Less than five years—barely a blink to the Camarilla, a time period over which very few Primogen would fall, even the stupid or innocent. But an Anarch government, obviously, has a faster turn-around time. Most of the Lords don’t give notice to her scrutiny, but something in the flick of Theodore’s dark eyes makes her think he does, and more so: almost makes her think he can trace her thoughts. But he says nothing. “Would you please step forward, and present yourself to the Marquis?”<br>
<br>
The crowd parts nervously for Justice, to the side and behind her, leaving her alone in front of the dozen deadly individuals. The Marquis looks down at where she is kneeling, and over the years, he has not been replaced. An imposing man, dark and austere looking, the black coat edged with silver. Regal in the fashion that Prince Mordred must have been, the dark coin of his father, at King Arthur’s court. Stern, though, and unaffected.<br>
<br>
“From what House do you hail?” The Marquis’ voice is level, but deep. It dredges out the solemnity from any gathered, speaks to the dark places in the quiet night. Justice clears her throat nervously, buying herself time to try and remember the codes, the pseudonyms, from the last time she had to use them. Precious seconds before relief floods over her. “The…the warrior-poets, my liege.” She says, as she remembers.<br>
<br>
“Justice, then, of the Warrior-Poets.” And then, the words no new member of a city ever wants to hear. “I remember you.” Justice swears she can hear the rustlings of clothing as the gathered populace leans in to hear better. “As you should recall, any gathered in this domain that number more than three are represented in the House of Lords. You bow to Callas, who bows to me. Requests of me from you go through Callas.” He gestures, and one of the Lords that Justice vaguely recognized inclines his head. “I trust you understand the edicts of this domain?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, my Lord.” Justice’s heart, if it still could, would be hammering in her chest, awaiting the question she is certain is coming. The silence is alive, for her, with apprehension.<br>
<br>
“I’m…equally certain, that you remember the circumstances under which you last took leave of us.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, my Lord.” A mad desire floods her to attempt to babble an explanation, just so she no longer has to feel her his gaze on the back of her bowed head, but she bites her tongue.<br>
<br>
“You bring no other problems to our shores this time, I hope?” The words wry, slightly biting. “No other childer to wreck certain havoc?”<br>
<br>
Not yet, Justice thinks. The image flashes in her mind, of curious, shiny eyes. Marisa sucking on a juicebox of blood back at the apartment. Hopefully Chlöe does not check the closets when she is not present at populace. “No, my Lord.” She swallows her pride. “I beg your apology for the incident of years past, my Lord. It was never my intention. Juanita betrayed me as surely as she betrayed you.” A silence of the crowd, as she considers her next words, is deep. “Should I find her in this domain, is her life forfeit?”<br>
<br>
        Rustlings among the House of Lords. Callas speaks up. “Sabbat have no recognition here. We would ask that you put her execution in our hands, so we can make sure it done correctly, or it might reflect even worse upon yourself.”<br>
<br>
        Shame joins with apprehension and creates an emotional vice. “Yes, my Liege.”<br>
<br>
        The Marquis speaks up again. “That is all.” He gestures toward her, and Justice is versed enough to step back into the relative safety of the crowd, the curious glances burning holes of guilt in her armor of idealism. Theodore speaks up again.<br>
<br>
        “Do any others crave recognition from the Marquis?” Silence, waiting. No one steps forward.<br>
<br>
        “Then good night.” The Town Crier says. Justice looks towards the front, and swears that he is looking directly at her as his mouth forms the next words. Chills run down her back. “And good Hunting.” He tips his fedora to the crowd, his gaze never deviating from her own horrified one, and the crowd bleeds away.<br>

The vato tied up in the middle of the living room floor was on the near end of hyperventilating, his breathing faster than a panicked animal. The eyes, which had been shut like winepresses a few minutes ago, were now simply closed. His lips moved in a familiar cadence that looked as if it might be a prayer. His wrists were rubbed raw from straining against the rough rope at his back, and pink stains dyed his cotton tank-top.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, Justice was able to read his lips and realized what he was saying.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ayudas. Ayudas. Por favor, me Ayudas. Por favor dios, Santo Maria, excepto mí.”<br>
<br>
Shit. Juanita was looking quietly horrified. Justice moved beside her and put a hand on her shoulder.<br>
<br>
“The Kiss takes away all pain, Juanita. You can help him. You’ll only take a little, and then he’ll be on the street again, and remembering nothing.”<br>
<br>
Juanita’s gaze turned to Justice’s face, and it appeared shattered, hopelessly distant, almost lost. Good at least that she didn’t know the lie present in the words. Brujah weren’t Ventrue, they couldn’t make their victims forget. He would probably suffer the rest of his days with memories of this night. And Baby Brujah, Baby Vampires in general—the first feeding was before they learned self-control. Almost always, the supplier of the first feeding died.<br>
<br>
But it didn’t turn out that way this time. Maybe it was due to the extreme closeness that had shared even before Juanita had become a vampire, maybe she had let something slip in the words, but Juanita turned towards Justice and sized her up instantly. “You’re lying. I don’t know about what, but you are.”<br>
<br>
Justice’s heart sank. “Juanita…”<br>
<br>
“And it hurts me, too. How can you be such monsters, to think only about his pain? Oh, his pain is the easy one, he is the one straining under the ropes and bleeding there and crying for God to save him, as I did once. I got Satan in return, witchcraft, and is that to be his release now? How could I do it? How?”<br>
<br>
Justice lead Juanita over to the drooping couch and sat her down, mindless entirely of the young man still tied in the middle of the living room. “Juanita, I understand, I really do. But if you don’t drink, you’ll die, and in excruciating pain. You can’t eat normal food anymore. Blood is everything.”<br>
<br>
Juanita began sobbing bitterly. Justice touched the thick hair, mahogany midnight, almost a pelt, lightly. Her intention was entirely to comfort—she never could have imagined that Juanita would object to feeding. In her line of work, protecting the chola or its acquisitions, people had died regularly, and she hadn’t seemed to mind killing them.<br>
<br>
“Don’t touch me.” A delayed reaction, because Juanita had allowed it for the first few moments. What poisonous thoughts were circling in her brain, to keep her from everything Justice knew she wanted and needed? “I know the blood is everything. You turned me with blood, you changed me with it, into a monster, like you. A vampire, you said. A vampire. A demon that sucks on the souls of others in order to prolong its unnatural life. I didn’t know. God, I didn’t know. And if I had, I would gladly have died.”<br>
<br>
Justice was at a loss for words. She had embraced Juanita in a moment of sheer love and pity. How do you feel when the receiver of the transplanted organ tells you she’d like to toss that damn kidney right back in your face? And Justice couldn’t bring herself to take Juanita’s delicate wrists and force her to the ground, to let the smell of the vitae get into her nose until it was overwhelming. She supposed this was why you were never supposed to embrace someone you loved. Vampirism is a cold, unfeeling, business. But in the end, why do you bring someone into the fold? Loneliness, nine times out of ten. Vampirism makes eternity cold and unfeeling, but that doesn’t mean you ever stop hoping it won’t be.<br>
<br>
As if to emphasize that statement, Kevin came in, then, from the lone bedroom. His gray eyes flickered over the restrained young man, and Justice and Juanita aptly not-commiserating on the couch. He didn’t need to ask what was wrong. He sighed, as if this all bored and pained him on some very shallow level. “Juanita.” He said, the tones dulcet and compelling. Had he used that voice on Justice, she knew she would have been all over him in a minute. But Juanita apparently had greater powers of self-control.<br>
<br>
“No.” Juanita spit out the words bitterly. “I won’t do it. Kill me, or let me die.”<br>
<br>
“Juanita.” Came the tones again, sweet to the ear, sweet to the mind, convincing. “I’m not asking you to touch him. Pretend he isn’t there. Just come to me.”<br>
<br>
Juanita hesitated, halfway, Justice could tell, between walking over to him like it was no big deal and what the hell was his problem, or refusing for the sheer deviant pleasure of making him mad. Well, once Juanita had known him a little longer, she would see. You couldn’t make Kevin mad. He was utterly unaffected. In the worst of cases, he would remove himself from your presence before he was tempted to drop his shield of austerity and rush you, teaching you the hard way.<br>
<br>
“No.” Juanita finally decided, and the word sounded in very inflection like a stubborn two-year old.<br>
<br>
“Juanita.” Came a third time, slightly chastising, as if he was questioning, inside, why exactly he had to do even this, light scolding though it was. A shaming that was gentle, even, as if it was a social impasse in this room with just the three—four—of them. She shouldn’t need this convincing. She should know what was good for her. He doesn’t want to hurt her. She should go to him…now. Holding her breath, Justice watched as Juanita bit back a compulsive shudder and walked over to Kevin, like a striding panther.<br>
<br>
“Okay. What the hell do you want?” Juanita asked, studying his bare feet in the somehow-elegant striped bathrobe. Across the room, Justice managed to tear her glance from Kevin’s face to his feet, as well. They flexed on the carpet, bared the tendons straight, curled and uncurled, stretching as though they were preparing to run, to sprint, to chase down. Had it not been wildly inappropriate, Justice might have giggled. She and Juanita were both staring in fascination at Kevin’s creepy feet. But the Beast inside her knew what it meant. Whether or not he showed it, Kevin had considerable emotion invested in this situation. Something about the here and now was important to him, and his willingness to use his physical strength, rather than his far-greater social, said something.<br>
<br>
“I don’t want anything. Just stand here with me.” Twilight, dusky and enveloping, that voice.<br>
<br>
Justice bit her lip as Kevin laid a hand on Juanita’s shoulder. Juanita breathed out, slow and deep, her self-control on the edge of firmly in place, trying so desperately to look dignified. The wrong move now could be disastrous, in the form of the slightest humiliation on Juanita’s part sending her stalking out of the apartment, to find some way to prove her power and her strength. And what, Justice worried hopelessly at the thought like a dog without teeth at a tough bone, if the Thirst should hit her then?<br>
<br>
“That’s it.” Kevin said encouragingly, as Juanita hadn’t moved. “Now. Sit with me, Juanita. Right here, yes, on the floor. That’s just fine.” Kevin’s hands moved from Juanita’s shoulder to hold her hands, the both of them in a way that seemed gentle, but could turn to a hold she couldn’t escape from more quickly than a breath. “Just relax.” His one hand holding both of hers, his free hand touched her eyelashes, smoothing them down. “Calm down.”<br>
<br>
The wrong words. One eye flashed open. “I am calm.” Kevin expertly regained control of the situation.<br>
<br>
“Of course you are. You’re just so tense. It’s fine. Don’t worry about anything. We’ll take care of everything.” The hand moving back to her shoulders, the thumb relaxing the seizing knots out of her corded neck.<br>
<br>
“I can’t drink from him. I can’t do that.” The breath coming like it did before the bloody tears started, biting her lip to try and stop them, and Juanita, somehow, in some totally unexpected way, able to tell her emotional problems to Kevin instead of to Justice, who at one point, Justice was certain, she had loved. What was it about the son of a bitch, that he could come in with a strength that was wrapped in silk and totally disarm you so that you felt like you were drowning in all the good emotions?<br>
<br>
“I know. Shhh, shhh. Don’t worry about it. Just sit for a minute, and relax.” And Juanita relaxed, no longer having to bite her lip, breathing gently, almost fluidly. No bitter tears of rage and self-hate. Calm and very obviously trying to get a grip, to please Kevin, if nothing else. That tension that could be labeled as nothing but the smallest amount of jealousy flooded through Justice. Her childer, and Kevin was taking control, just as he always did. Damn him. Even if he was doing what he asked her to do, even if this worked out beautifully, good cop and bad cop, damn him.<br>
<br>
“Now, Juanita. I want you to look me in the eye.” Kevin said, slowly and inexorably. Juanita resisted moving from her place of peace for a moment, skin around the eyes tightening in stress and pain, and slight anger. But she didn’t want to show any of that to Kevin, smooth-talking charming Southern asshole that he was, and so she relaxed again, calmed herself down, and opened her eyes, slowly, to stare directly in Kevin’s own. Eyes of the darkest chocolate, full of emotion, rage and pain and passion, pitted again eyes of lightest gray ice, full of…nothing. Absolutely nothing.<br>
<br>
“Juanita. Bite him.”<br>
<br>
Could angels have seen, or cared to see, they would have wept at the sight of Juanita falling to Kevin McGovern’s domination, and falling upon the restrained young man with relish and hunger. They would have cried diamond tears to see her give in to her Beast, her thirst unrestrained, gulping down the sticky red mortality with all the passion that she had originally used to resist it. It was a lion clawing apart a wildebeest with complete and utter abandon, the monster released, a true rape of purity in it’s deepest sense. It was a shame, and the ultimate sorrow, but it was Juanita’s first triumph, though unwilling, over the night.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stephencrowley>Stephen Crowley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#FF9300>(2/2/03 8:01:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Foreshadowing a blazing... = Justice</span><hr size=1> Twilight, now, and ever darker.<br>
<br>
Disposing of a human body was a nasty business: dangerous and tiring through its required extremely high attention to detail. Thus, Kevin had been up long into the night, after Juanita had collapsed in the bedroom in utter sated exhaustion, though weeping bitter tears.<br>
<br>
Justice had helped where she could. She had removed the skin of the hands, feet and face, soaked them in ether for a few hours to heighten flammability and disguise the distinctly identifiable odor of burning human flesh, and stuck them in the furnace of the apartment complex, waiting until they were consumed to ash. Kevin had done the messy work, though, and Justice had never seen him more gently apologetic then she had in that instance, in the uncomplaining silence with which he went about his portion. Placing the body on a plastic sheet, he had set to it with a truncheon and a splintering baseball bat, and by the time they both were done, Juanita’s first meal looked enough like a gang ambush to withstand police medical inspection. Then he had bundled the body in brown paper, easy to dispose of, and kept nasty stains off the car, and driven it the short, nerve-wracking distance to the local marsh.<br>
<br>
“You could have a place here, you and her both. If you don’t fuck it up. I don’t have any reason to stay here if I’m caught.” He had said as explanation for his uncharacteristically generous acts. Justice had nodded, suspecting him still—after all, when had he ever cared about her welfare?—seen him off, and gone to sleep on the living-room couch. When she woke, at the darker side of dusk, Juanita was nowhere to be found in the apartment and Kevin had either commandeered the bed, or shared it. It couldn’t be known, and it couldn’t be cared about. In any case, Juanita would always do whatever she damn well pleased. But Justice had an idea where she might have gone, her childe, so resistant to the dictates and prices of immortality.<br>
<br>
She scaled the overpass as easily as she had a few weeks ago: Juanita had lately been reluctant to go outdoors at all, though for what reasons she did not reveal. Given her outbursts last night, she might think that the outdoors were not allowed for monsters, or she might have thought of them for once, and been worried about running into her old chola. Justice considered the latter of these two the more unlikely option, however. When had Juanita ever given a care for them? Words appeared in her brain to mock her, and they had Juanita’s characteristic, musical Spanish accent—‘a monster may as well embrace the night completely.’<br>
<br>
She was there, and made no move to acknowledge or deny Justice’s presence in any way. She was completely absorbed in a game of basketball, going on in a makeshift court set up close to the railway yard. Every once in awhile fights broke out, though these were settled more through posturing than fists. These players had enough violence in their everyday lives of street survival that games called for no more. It was possible that Juanita had gone out here to watch and hear the game with her unnaturally keen senses. It was more probable that she had come here to be able to mock Justice, when she came to collect her.<br>
<br>
Justice sat a few feet from Juanita, and waited a few seconds before saying the scripted sentence. “You’re not one of them, anymore.”<br>
<br>
Juanita, ever quick on the uptake, replied, “And whose fault is that?” Though in this barbed, blaming statement, she doesn’t turn to look her sire in the eye. From that alone, Justice can garner a little hope.<br>
<br>
“Both of ours, if any. But look. You can’t keep torturing yourself.” She bit her lip before saying the dreaded words that had to come. “Sooner or later, you’ll have to decide.”<br>
<br>
“Decide what?” Juanita asked, feigning innocence. “There’s no decision to be made, ai? It’s been done.” Silence for a minute. “I’m adjusting. You said I’d need time to adjust, like some fucking city shrink, and that’s what I’m fucking doing. So leave me the hell alone.”<br>
<br>
“All right.” Justice stood, and brushed imaginary dust from her jeans. “Kevin and I are going out, later, once the bars are full. If you want to come, you’re welcome.”<br>
<br>
Juanita was still sulky. “I don’t have an ID.”<br>
<br>
“With Kevin, that won’t be a problem.”<br>
<br>
This time, the voice definitely had a grudge in it, though it wasn’t dipped in poison, like some of her words of late had been. More resentful, Justice decided, of having to make known the fact that she actually cared. “Can you do things like that? Make…people…do things?” The tension was clearly evident in her body when she said the words.<br>
<br>
“Not like Kevin did last night.” Good cop, bad cop! her brain screamed. Don’t switch sides! She needs to live somehow, and if she won’t learn from you, and you convince her not to learn from Kevin… “Each clan has different powers.” She said, squashing the voice down into the deepest recesses of her conscience. “Naturally, by the power of our blood, we can move quickly, have lots of strength, and can be…extremely charming. What Kevin did, or at least how it seemed to me, was the hallmark of a different clan, the ones that usually rule our kind. Making people do what you command them to—you can imagine it might come in handy.”<br>
<br>
“Rule?” The word was scoffing. “You have immortality, and use it for fucking power games? Proletariat and Bourgeoisie, is that how it is? Some elite upper class, of mummies, maybe? Dead people that used to be kings?”<br>
<br>
“The Princes will tell you that power is everything. And when you have so many of our kind under your control, you can get a good many things done. For good or for evil is your choice in the matter.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah, well, being extremely charming—what the hell is that? How can that get you anywhere? Strong and fast, I can see. Strong to get you things, and fast to get out of there when you…get something that wasn’t what you wanted. But what about the other? You bat your eyelashes and they give you the world on a silver platter?”<br>
<br>
“Don’t sell it short.” Justice warned. “As you saw with Kevin, you can learn other powers, if you have someone to teach you. And I’ve seen elders of our kind calm an entire crowd or incite them to riot. Kevin can call to him anyone he’s ever met, across the world, simply by letting it be known that he wants them, and they cannot resist. There are possibilities to it.”<br>
<br>
“Maybe.” Juanita said, and for the first time in days, her voice did not sound quite as black as once it had. “Maybe.”<br>
<br>
“So stick with it. Wait and see.” And with that, Justice turned to really go. She had some questions she wanted to ask Kevin about the previous night.<br>
<br>
“What was the decision you were talking about?” Juanita wanted to ask, as a parting question. “You’re acting as if there’s some other choice than immortality.”<br>
<br>
Justice had answered, “Well, there’s sunlight. Sunlight and fire, both of them kill us. So there’s always a way out if you really can’t take it.”<br>
<br>
Looking back on it now, it seemed possible that giving Juanita that particular piece of information might have been a big mistake.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=65.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=65.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=65.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=65.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=65.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.222<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
