<br>
Vicious lost that game and the $500 that went along with it as his dart missed the board, hitting the wall behind it with an audible 'thunk'. He glared at the board for a moment.<br>
<br>
"Hey man, come on. Pay up." he heard from behind him. Vicious had been hustling the bikers out of money by beating them, <i>very</i> severely, at darts. At that last  dart had been the first time in about twenty years that Vicious had actually missed the damn board.<br>
<br>
He turned around quickly and stared at the biker before him. Sweaty, beer-gutted, long-haired, and full-bearded. The kind of man Vicious loved to hang around, if only because most Torries would be repulsed by the sight of him, let alone the sweaty, unshowered odor. Vicious smiled and nodded.<br>
<br>
"Yeah... here's the 500 I owe. Good game." Vicious smiled as he handed his opponent his cash. The biker counted it out, nodded, and handed the money to another member of the gang.<br>
<br>
"Hey, you happen to see who was looking for McGowen?" Vicious asked as he gathered his things. He was trying, trying so very, fucking hard, not to betray his true, utter annoyance at the loss. He'd simply win the money back, but last time he did that he discovered that the Brujah do not, in fact, enjoy losing. It really wasn't worth the risk.<br>
<br>
"Uhhh... see that guy in the suit by the bar? I think it was him." the biker responded, thrusting his thumb towards the bar in the direction of a man who was currently showing a sheet of paper, probably a photo, to the bartender. Vicious nodded his thanks and stared at the man for a moment. Every inch of his face... eyes... hair... ears... nose... mouth... committed to memory in seconds. He then hit the doors and waited outside, leaning against his Dart and staring intently at the door.<br>
<br>
23 seconds passed.<br>
<br>
Vicious went back inside the bar, yelled "YO!" at the top of his lungs to get the attention of the suited man, and walked back outside, annoyed at best. He went back leaning against the Dart and staring intently at the door.<br>
<br>
30 seconds passed.<br>
<br>
Vicious <i>stormed</i> back inside the bar, grabbed the man by the back of his suit jacket, and dragged him outside, tossing him against the hood of the Dart and pulling out his baton.<br>
<br>
"Fucking hell, dude! What do I have to do to get your fucking attention? Cut my arms off and bleed all over the damn place?!"<br>
<br>
Much to Vicious' surprise, the man pulled out a knife and rushed him. Although it only took about 2 seconds to take him out with the baton, it was at this moment that Vicious realized one of the most important things of the evening...<br>
<br>
This wasn't the same guy.<br>
<br>
"Oh shit. Sorry, man. Who'd've thought you'd look just like the nosey guy looking for me? And why am I talking to your unconscious body?"<br>
<br>
"Because, apparently, you're as insane as we expected."<br>
<br>
Vicious whirled and faced the newcomer. It was the man he'd seen in the bar. He was standing only 4 feet away from the car. Vicious extended the baton to its full length.<br>
<br>
"Wait, Mr. McGowen. I'm here on behalf of your sire."<br>
<br>
Vicious stopped.<br>
<br>
"What does SHE want." The look on Vicious' face made it very clear that refusing to answer the question wasn't an option in this case.<br>
<br>
"She is concerned, and wishes for your safe return to her..."<br>
<br>
"...her happy-little-sheltered-Torrie-life? I don't think so. Tell her I said to fuck off.... uhhh... again." Vicious turned around before the sound of a gun hammer being pulled back stopped him.<br>
<br>
"Madame Showman has made it clear that you are to return."<br>
<br>
Vicious smiled. There was one Discipline that few Kindred possessed, and even fewer truly understood how to use. It was a Discipline guaranteed to safeguard the life of the user, no matter what the situation. It was the Discipline of....<br>
<br>
"SWEET BABY JESUS! LOOK! THE MOOKER HAS FALLEN OFF OF THE MULE!"<br>
<br>
....the completely nonsensical distraction.<br>
<br>
The messenger took one look at Vicious' horrified expression and quickly turned in the direction that his shaking finger indicated. After that point, the messenger took about 4 heavy blows to the head and was rendered unconscious. Vicious jumped into his car, pulled a roadmap out of the glovebox, scrawled some fake 'directions' to his next 'target' and crammed it in the door, slamming it hard. Opening the door and letting the map drop, he pulled out and sped away into the night, looking for more bars with hopefully fewer Torries from Portland.<br>
<br>

This one is kind of half-assed. I started it earlier, but then I finally got my copy of Dynasty Warriors 4 in the mail, and just had to end the story.<br>
