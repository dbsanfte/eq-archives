<br>
Lessee, so Satan is, &quot;the adversary of God and lord of evil in Judaism and Christianity&quot;<br>
Yes, we established that in xian mythology Satan is the name given the god/demon/fallen angel/son of god who opposed him. What I thought had been explained several times was that Satanists don't buy the mythology, so don't really worship someone they see as a deity....oh bother...just go back to the link/DBC's posts/our earlier exchanges. <br>
&quot;Apparently, Webster agrees with me. The name says it all!&quot;<br>
And us, and Trish and Candy and Heather....We all agreed that in YOUR theology he is the enemy of god, but then prejudging a belief system before studying it would be like a JW refusing to study LDS because it is of Satan right? Are you seeing what we mean by hypocrisy here?<br>
<br>
&quot;Do any of you really think that the name was not created to signify that they oppose basic Judeo Christian values and or doctrine?&quot;<br>
<br>
So? How does this change the argument? Piss you off as a xian? So? Values in opposition to intolerance, sexism, violence against innocents doesn't sound so bad to me...see how perspective is everything?<br>
<br>
&quot;Was anyones mind changed about the Church of Satan after reading the website information?&quot;<br>
Not changed so much as expanded and better informed. <br>
<br>
&quot;the name of the LDS Church or Church of Jesus Christ should be a strong indicator that it is a Christian faith&quot;<br>
<br>
Or that the followers are deluded, mistaken or deceptive. Perhaps some feel using the name of Christ in a non-xian religion is way more blasphemous than Satanists...I don't know since I don't care much about xian in-fighting. Oh, and be careful about names--Greenland is icy and Iceland is green, people park in driveways and drive on parkways...<br>
<br>
&quot;If that isnt clear as common sense, then I am wasting my breath.&quot;<br>

As I believe I already pointed out, they are exactly opposed to the judeo-xian self-repressive denial of human nature.  Is it natural for priests to be celibate?  Is it natural to turn the other cheek when struck?  Is it natural for people to feel guilty over a basic attraction to another?  Is it natural for people to want to kill, then outlaw it, and still do it in the name of some “higher” purpose anyway?  <br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
Here is the rub.  Any satanist you walk up to and ask will tell you almost nothing.  They will say, “Go buy a copy of The Satanic Bible by Anton LeVey and read it.”  Then maybe Satan Speaks, or The Satanic Rituals.  If you have more questions they really aren’t interested in helping you.  They aren’t some sideshow to be gawked at.  You either read and understand, or you don’t.  They aren’t looking to win converts.  If you don’t fit, that’s fine with them, move along…<br>
<br>
Go to one of their <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.personalsatan.com/lttd/ubbthreads.php?Cat=" target="top">web boards</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and log on.  You won’t see anything until you create an account, but if your salvation is so weakly held that the reading of some 36 year old book will shake you from it, then I have to laugh.  As one Magister put it, “Fear controls the herds, be not afraid.”<br>
<br>
From Joshua, a Church of Satan member:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>These are only my observations, and I want it to be clear that I am not speaking with any authority other than my own limited experience and superior intelligence (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). That caveat thus given, I now present my modest little FAQ for the scrutiny of the board members as well as the erudition of the newbies: <br>
<br>
(I welcome any suggestions, criticisms, or additions) <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1. Children are naturally Satanic / natural Satanists.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
This error arises from misreading the section of The Satanic Bible that discusses imagery in Satanic magic. Children are natural magicians, but magician does not equal Satanist. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2. Satanists hate Christians.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
This one can be especially irritating to hear over and over again. While Satanists do reject the whole of Christian philosophy as the anti-human and anti-self dogma that it is, the adherants to Christian philosophy are accepted as just another herd group that can be manipulated to further the Satanist's agenda. There is nothing special about Christianity that sets it apart from the Democratic Party, rock groupies, political demonstrators, or any other group-identity fanatics as far as the Satanist is concerned. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>3. There are different sects within Satanism</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
Wrong. There is only Satanism as codified and defined by Anton LaVey in The Satanic Bible. The only institution that remains steadfastly true to this philosophy is the church that Doktor LaVey himself founded -- the Church of Satan. All other institutions (including their members) that claim the title of &quot;Satanist&quot; are pseudosatanists or Devil worshippers. <br>
<br>
Despite claims to the contrary, the vast majority of these pretenders could never function as a Satanist (because, quite simply, they are not Satanists) and eventually wind up in jail or back in church where they belong. This truth will become more and more apparent as an individual's understanding of real Satanism grows. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>4. Satanism is all about doing whatever you like.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
This requires clarification. Indulgence is indeed the main aspect of Satanism, but it is not the only one. The goal of the Satanist is not to engage in mindless gratification, but rather to achieve &quot;strength through joy.&quot; It is about recognizing the absolute sovereignty of the ego and the methods to utilize one's being as a tool for achieving joy and self-aggrandizement. It is not about smoking dope, getting shitfaced, or any other temporarilly gratifying activities that, ultimately, lead to nowhere. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>5. Satanism is inclusive to all who accept themselves and reality.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
Satanism is not a religion for stoners, morons, group-huggers, lonely misfits, criminals, or other non-functioning members of society. Whether they accept themselves or not, they will never be able to utilize Satanic methods for self-aggrandizement. It is good if they know their place, and that place is not here. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>6. You don't have to agree with all of The Satanic Bible to consider yourself a Satanist.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
First of all, it isn't about &quot;agreement&quot; or acquiescence; it is about resonance. Satanism is a religion for the individual -- that's true -- but it must be understood that it is NOT for just any old &quot;individual&quot;; it is for Satanic individuals. <br>
<br>
So how do you know if you are a Satanic individual? If you can read The Satanic Bible and find that its words resonate with your understanding of the world, if you are willing to personally verify the assertions and methodologies outlined therein, if you find it (all of it) to be a gratifying and workable philosophy -- then you know that you are a Satanic individual. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>7. Satanists aren't REALLY &quot;born,&quot; they are made.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
Those who make this statement are usually shit-disturbers or non-Satanists desperately trying to &quot;convert&quot; or &quot;fit in&quot; (which belies a complete ignorance of what is meant by divorcing oneself from hypocritical self-deceit). But for those who don't &quot;get it,&quot; I'll use a simile: &quot;Geniuses are born, not made.&quot; You can study something to find out if you're good at it, or even learn by rote if you're not good at it, but you will never attain the level of mastery that a genius has in that particular field. They just have a knack for it. They were born that way. <br>
<br>
Similarly, Real Satanists have a &quot;knack&quot; for Satanism in a way that simply cannot be learned. They don't &quot;follow&quot; the rules or live by the &quot;word&quot; because their religion &quot;tells them to.&quot; They live this way because, for the way they inherently are, it is the most gratifying and natural existence for them. They just have a knack for it. They were born that way. <br>
<br>
So one might ask of himself, &quot;Am I a Satanic Genius?&quot; <br>
<br>
Which is really the same as asking, &quot;Am I a Satanist?&quot; <br>
<br>
Remember -- &quot;hypocritical self-deceit&quot; applies to non-Satanists who try to be a Satanist.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
I will not presume to speak further on their behalf.  Go to their site, read it and understand if you want to talk about it further.  Otherwise shut up about the stereo types your church would have you spew.  You don't even know anyone well enough for them to tell you they are a Satanist, and I am sick of the garbage that is being falsely spread about them.  The world has enough small minded prejudices in it already. <p>DBC67<br>

I was under the impression that the Temple of Set was another &quot;realm&quot; (not sure if that's the correct word) of Satanism, but from Joshua's tutorial on Satanism, it doesn't sound like it?<br>

<br>
Where in the name of my church does the name Satan appear?  It doesnt.  So the logical leap to believe that the church of Satan is of the devil is obvious.  BUT There is NO logical leap to assume that the Church of JESUS CHRIST  of Latter Day Saints, is of the devil. Again how is that NOT clear?<br>
<br>
<br>
Jappy, if you think that Mormonism doesnt allow you to question your own spirituality, you are wrong.  But if you want to be a member of the LDS church you ought to believe the doctrine.  If you dont believe the doctrine why would you choose to be a member?  We dont believe that the doctrine is up for debate like many other churches do.  We believe that it comes from God and since its his church, He gives the doctrine. Pretty simple.  If you dont like what is being taught, find a church where you feel comfortable.<br>
<br>
As far as accountabitlity, I think we are the exception in the Christian world (except maybe the free will baptists) We dont believe in once saved always saved.  We are all accountable for our choices and if we want to repent Christ is there, but we have to make the effort to forsake the sin and change our lives in such a way that shows that we are followers of Christ.  We believe that salvation is determined at the end of your life and depends not only on your belief in the Savior and his atonement, but what you did with your life and the choices you make.  You cant decide to be a Christian at age 13 and then commit crime or live immorally for the rest of your life and have an expectation that you will be saved. - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jappygirl>Jappygirl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/19/03 2:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: re: definitions</span><hr size=1> The Mormon religion is a cult and does not allow you to question their rules.  It dictates what you can read, drink, look at, wear, who you should marry and how much you should give to them.  They do everything possible to separate Mormons from non-Mormons and sadly think they are holier and greater than any other religion in the world.  They send con men (or as you may call them, “missionaries”) into third world countries to prey upon the uneducated, poor people and manipulate them into believing their hocus pocus.  Mormons feel that they are better than everyone else.  They feel that they are the only true church because they are supposedly headed by prophets.  Much like a cult, when you leave the Mormon Church you are often shunned or treated less affably by the members.  Mormons blindly and naively trust in a book that has virtually no historical evidence to corroborate its authenticity and depend on mostly on subjective reasoning.

Many xians would agree Satanism is of the devil, but say that LDS is too and that at least Satanists are honest about it. This refutes the argument not at all.<br>
<br>
Oh.. and as for your ARROGANCE (a very nice xian trait...oops or is that Satanic) in stating that LDS, &quot;are the exception in the Christian world...we have to make the effort to forsake the sin and change our lives in such a way that shows that we are followers of Christ...You cant decide to be a Christian at age 13 and then commit crime or live immorally for the rest of your life and have an expectation that you will be saved.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow--I don't want to speak for Trish, Kate or Candy here, but you are NOT the great shining exception here. Even Catholics don't believe that just because you are confirmed you can live immorally the rest of your life and don't have to &quot;make the effort to forsake sin&quot;. I'm sure you feel morally superior and are in a real slap yourself on the back mood here, but if you ask me the JW's have this ground the most secure. Not that I think they are less full of shit, but they actually follow the bible way, way better and more stringently than Mormons any day of the week.<br>

A thread titled &quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Happy Jesus on a Stick Day</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot; with the content regarding who you would crucify if you could.

Jeez, if only I could count the number of times I've seen on christian bulletin boards members (Babycenter, mainly) say things like atheists aren't fit to be parents, or that their children should be taken away from them, or that we are all amoral pigs that should be deported out of the country....<br>
Well, I'd think that all christians are assholes, too.<br>

Nope.<br>
<br>
<br>
You are offended by what you read because of your beliefs. But you have to understand that to atheists, and members of countless other religions, the crucification of your savior is *pretend*. It's understandable that you are offended by that based on your beliefs; that's not what I'm saying...what I'm saying is you can't expect someone that doesn't believe a shred of christianity to hold some amount of respect for the belief system. One can respect another's right to believe what they choose without having to respect the belief system itself. <br>

<br>
The whole thing is kind-of a turn around...Christians know that we are always judged by the outside world by what they see us do.  (Do we &quot;walk the walk&quot; - so to speak)  After all, who knows who we might turn off from Christianity because of a bad example we may have set.  (Like you said yourself, how many times have you been turned off by Christians because of what you've seen them say or do)  I get angered because I feel like Christianity is always misjudged because of a few yahoo's out there.  Yet here it happened to me!  I was referred to a bulletin board, and the bad example was set in front of me.  Therefore only continuing the belief I have that there isn't anything about satanism that I really care about.  <br>
<br>
Hey, if that's the kind-of crap they want to fill their day with... (this would be the point where I can just &quot;leave 'em to God&quot; cause I have no desire / or calling at this point to study beyond what I've already done in the past.)<br>
<br>
The comment I pointed out may have been made by some teenage yahoo, but what about the other Christians mentioned in the thread by name (trying to remember at this point...)the Pope, any religious leader and televangelist, Billy Graham, Jan Crouch, Benny Hinn, Jerry Falwell...and then the number of political leaders!  <br>
<br>
Now I already know how some of you feel about the aforementioned names (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and I'll even throw a <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  in on my behalf) but to publically wish death is just wrong.

The same can be said for certain groups of christians, certain groups of muslims, and certain kinds of other religious folk.<br>
<br>
How about the Westboro Baptist Church?? You know, the great folks that run the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/" target="top">God Hates Fags</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> site? <br>
Or what about the countless Christian White Supremacy groups, like Church of the Creator, The Church of Jesus Christ Christian (AKA, Aryan Nations), The Covenant Sword, The Arm of the Lord, Christian Patriots Defense League...<br>
need I go on? <br>
All these churches spawn hatred. The God Hates Fags site actually had a running clock for a while, with a picture of Matthew Shepard, counting how many days he had been burning in hell. (If you remember, Matt Shepard was the young gay man that got tied to a post and beat to death by a bunch of young christians). <br>
Do I judge all christians by the actions of these groups? No. <br>
I still maintain you're making a rash judgement about a belief system based on the opinions of a select group. <br>
Much like if I were to say &quot;all christians are hate mongering, violent bigots&quot; based on my viewing of any of the above groups' websites.<br>

Did you read the Satanic Bible?<br>
<br>
As mentioned before, that is the ONLY source for anything on their belief system.  They don't expect each other to agree with interpretations, or even get along with each other for that matter.  Everyone when asked will tell you, &quot;Go read TSB.&quot;  If you didn't read it, you didn't study it.  They disclaim their posts with &quot;This is what I think and not the official position of the CoS but....&quot;  <br>
<br>
Okay, I personaly wouldn't mind seeing Graham or Roberts dethroned and humiliated (or Limbaugh.)  I think they are some of the most damaging people alive and I have zero respect for their bigoted and hateful views.  Can I claim that is the case for all atheists?  Nope.  We can go to the fundie board and see atheists blamed for all the worlds woes, we have been told we will suffer, we are horrible parents, that you xians look forward to our pain and suffering, wish bodily dismemberment and agony upon us.  Does that mean I have to hate you?  Nope.  Hell, our PRESIDENT says we are not even real citizens and unworthy of our country.

About the Satanic Bible, if there's someone out there who's read it, is it similar in format to the Christian Bible?  Do they have another name for it?  I'm just asking because by calling it that, it implies some connection, like when people call the Qur'an the &quot;Muslim Bible&quot; they are trying to put Islamic concepts into a familiar framework.<br>
<br>
I would be interested to know if it is a rewrite of the Bible from a Satanic standpoint, or is it completely different?  I know some people view the Qur'an as a Bible rewrite, but really it is nothing like the Bible.<br>

These groups indeed spawn hatred, (and yep, I studied Identity Movements last fall as well).  That's why they are labeled hate groups.  <br>
<br>
They like to think they are Christian, but in fact they are going against what the Bible says with their actions.  Nowhere does the Bible support the idea of a culturally, intellectually, and morally superior nation or race.  Christians are instructed to love all people, even enemies.  (Matt.5:44)  <br>
<br>
Emmy, All I'm saying is that my semester I spent studying world religious movements is a whole lot more than many people can say that they've gone out of their way to learn more about something that is outside of their own religious bubble.  <br>

As to whether or not it's biased...dang it all if ya just can't make everyone happy all the time.  (First people complain that not enough of us take the time to educate ourselves, then when we do,they complain when it's not up to their standard.)  Be assured though, that my school is accredited through the New York State Board of Regents. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Off to take a much needed vacation...<br>
