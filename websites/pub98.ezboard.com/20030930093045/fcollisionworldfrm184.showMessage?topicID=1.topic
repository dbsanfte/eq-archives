Samantha got off her hoverboard, and took the keys out of her bookbag. She walked towards the door and put the key into the lock and opened it.<br>
&quot;Wow,&quot; it was beautiful inside, to her at least. The walls were a stormcloud blue and the trim was white. The carpet was the color of the walls, she knelt down and touched it. &quot;Shaaag, oh this'll be fun.&quot; She walked further into the room and saw that there was a huge bed, and that and the rest of her room was in her favorite color, lilac purple. She laid her bag on the floor and jumped onto the bed, and sighed as she nearly sank into it. &quot;Aahhh! yes, comfy bed. don't want to leave, don't want to leave NOOO, must get up. Darn.&quot; She got up and explored the rest of the house. It had another two bedrooms, one in burgundy, another in forest green. And a nice kitchen. A living room already with TV, and CD player, and a nice bathroom that was as big as a bedroom. She walked back into the living room, and sighed, exhausted onto the couch. The living room also had anice little bench under the window for reading. She looked around the house left to her and smiled. &quot;Thanks dad, I think I'm going to like it here.&quot;<br>

As she got about halfway done she heard her stomach growl. She looked down to it and patted it.<br>
&quot;Don't worry tummy, as soon I'm done putting my clothes away, we'll go to the mall and get some stuff and the food court, okay.&quot; As she put away the last of the clothes she walked back out and was about to go out when she looked at the door, and saw a letter posted to it. She saw her name in what looked like her father's handwriting on it. She tore it off, and sat in a nearby chair.<br>

Samantha smiled and looked at the check for 10,000 dollars. She put it in her now empty backpack and headed out the door.<br>

Samantha walked into her house and smiled. <br>
&quot;HOME SWEET HOME.&quot; She sighed. &quot;It's going to be kind of weird living on my own...really weird.&quot;  She started taking stuff up and setting it up around the house. She sighed and looked at it. &quot;I'll set up the computer and stuff tomorrow.&quot; She walked into her room and changed into her pajamas, and set her clock for six am. She had stopped bye the school and was a full student, &quot;glad I don't have to wear a uniform.&quot; SHe said, and soon was fully asleep.<br>

Samantha glared at the alarm, and hit it as hard as she could. It went off and nearly broke.<br>
&quot;Stupid alarm.&quot; She yawned and walked into the bathroom to start getting ready for school. She walked out about 20 minutes later, ready to face the world, or at least the breakfast table.<br>
&quot;Ahh well, only cereal for today.&quot; Samantha said. She ate quickly and walked out the door, making sure to put the alarm and locks on, and hovered over to her new school, Sim City High<br>

Samantha went into the house, and shakily sat down. <br>
&quot;You'd think the forces that run the world would be nice enough to let me go to a school where I didn't have to wear a PATCH to stay conscious.&quot; She raked her hair back, and looked around her newly cluttered apartment. &quot;Well...at least I have something to take my mind off of it.&quot; She said, and got up to start setting up her computer. She knew it wouldn't take her very long, she just happened to be a computer nerd. She started setting it up, until the phone rang. She concentrated on the phone and let it float over.<br>
&quot;Hello, It's Sam.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hey, it's Steven.&quot; Sam smiled.<br>
&quot;Hey, what's up?&quot; She said, turning the computer on and flopping down on the couch. <br>
&quot;Felt like talking I guess...&quot; He said, then laughed. Samantha rolled her eyes.<br>
&quot;Really...&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't you laugh at me...I was just wondering if you wanted to, you know, go somewhere...&quot; Samantha grinned.<br>
&quot;Sure...why not, I need someone to show me around this place anyway.&quot; Samantha smiled, <br>
&quot;Alright, then I'll meet you at the mall then, tomorrow after school alright?&quot;<br>
&quot;Sure, I'll see you tomorrow.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hey...did I say, I was hanging up?&quot; He laughed.<br>
&quot;No...&quot;<br>
&quot;Good, then stay on and talk to me.&quot; Both of them talked long into the night as Samantha set up her house. <br>
&quot;Alright, you hang up..I gotta get to bed!&quot;<br>
&quot;No, you...&quot;<br>
&quot;You&quot;<br>
&quot;YOU!&quot; Steven shouted. Samantha smiled, and then collapsed onto her bed.<br>
&quot;On three then....1, 2,.....&quot;<br>
&quot;There's another number coming up soon right?&quot;<br>
&quot;yes, night, 3!&quot; She hung up her phone and sighed.<br>
&quot;Well..at least it's going to be interesting.<br>
