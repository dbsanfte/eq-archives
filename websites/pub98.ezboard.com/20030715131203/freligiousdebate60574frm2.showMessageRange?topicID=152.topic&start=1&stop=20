Any book that had derogatory comments about any group feel victim to this.<br>
<br>
Which I of course I think is crap, as it does not address the potential for learning and dialogue on controversial issues.  Ironically I attended a private Catholic High School and we had *no* banned books, and they refused to ban any book because they felt that address the controversy and opening a dialogue about it was more important.   Almost all the books we read and covered were banned at the public school my friends went to.  <br>

<br>
You should look up the list of the 100 most challenged books.  I think you can find information at the American Library Association website... www.ala.org <br>
<br>
Some of the choices are predictable.  Some you will find yourself scratching your head and thinking, &quot;Why???&quot;  I can't comprehend the reasons some groups come up with.  <br>
<br>
Does anyone recall when the latest Harry Potter film was released someone actually took a pair of scissors to the paperback (I think it was Chamber of Secrets) and cut it up.  The image of that act was unbelievably violent to me.  <br>
<br>
I think that an interesting question would be what is the true motivation of those who want to ban books.  I can't claim to know because I can't comprehend the idea of banning books, of banning knowledge and thought.  I used to teach Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 which is focused on a world in which all books are contraband (interesting...including the Bible itself).  One of the themes of this novel was that society was &quot;dumber&quot; due to the lack of books.  Mindless sheep watching mindless TV.  Could this be the goal of banning books...dumbing down society?  What is the benefit of dumbing down society?  Creating more followers....<br>

I think it's ridiculous to ban books.  ITA with the poster that said parents should take care of that.  However, I can't think of a single book off the top of my head that I would &quot;ban&quot; as long as it's read at an age appropriate time.  I also think children are capable of making their own choices on this issue.  I don't care for fictional horror stories.  But I made that choice on my own after reading a couple.  It drives me nuts when groups of people, whether it be political, relgious or otherwise take it upon themselves to make decisions for the general public.  (I'm not talking about laws, by the way) <p>-Misty<br>

Banning books, or rather &quot;why censorship is bad&quot;, is a pet topic of mine (In my former life, I was a journalist and you never escape first amendment type issues after that, LOL.). Anyway, I agree with Misty that I would be unlikely to ban my kids from reading something that was age appropropriate. I think that even books that bring up difficult subjects can have good learning value and help initiate great discussions between parents and children. <br>
<br>
And it really bothers me when schools ban perfectly good literature....when I was in high school, our school banned &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; because it had the &quot;n&quot; word in it. Which is ludicrous because the whole book came from an abolitionist POV. My parents checked out the book and had me read it at home. It taught me a lot about what slavery must have been like.<br>
<br>
I have to say though it was quite strange to read that list...where else would Madonna's &quot;Sex&quot; and Howard Stern's &quot;Private Parts&quot; (stunning works of literature that THEY are, LOL) be lumped in with Huck Finn and A Wrinkle in Time? Some of the books on that list were my favorites growing up and I intend to have my kids read them too.<br>

Pathetic. That's what I think of book banning. But, I suppose it's easier to ban a book then to read it and have an intelligent discussion about it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Raising kids is part joy, part guerilla warfare&quot;. ~Ed Asner</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mightyk>MightyK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/13/03 3:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: interesting list</span><hr size=1> I've never agreed with banning books. And I feel if a child expresses interest in a book they should be able to read it. If I feel it might be a questionable book, I'll read it too so we can talk about it when the child finishes the book. <br>
<br>
I believe in reading. A lot. I think most anything that can get a child to read is great. I can not fathom the banning of books. Now I have read some books that I really hope do not interest my children, but if so, well I'll work with them on the content if they want. But I would try to keep access from those books until they are teens or older.<br>
<br>
Good thing most books I find questionable would be difficult or uninteresting to a younger child.<br>

If I feel a book is inappropriate for my child, then I will act as a responsible parent and take the book away until he is older.  A book would have to be gratuitous in nature in order for me to take it away.  Merely saying the &quot;n&quot; word in a book won't warrant me taking the book away unless the book is trying to portray that as acceptable behavior.  I want my son to know that people used the &quot;n&quot; word so I can explain to him why he shouldn't use it.  I also think books on the Holocaust are crucial reading, not to dredge up old instances, but to try and prevent something like that from happening again...TO ANYONE.  I personally think that parents want certain books banned so they don't have to take the time to explain anything to their child.  Parenting is so much easier in a perfect world.  I suppose that if I was lazy, then I wouldn't want to explain slavery or the Holocaust to my child either.  <br>
<br>
BTW, I read one of the Howard Stern books.  I thought it was hysterical, but I'm sensible enough to not give the book to a 6 year old.  That is the joy of living in America.  I can choose to read it, and I can choose for my son not to read it.  If he wants to read it as an adult, then that is his business, and his right as an American.  Besides, Howard rules!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So is the government having access to your library records and book purchases.<br>

Also encouraging you to keep an eye out for people behaving &quot;suspicously&quot; or looking &quot; out of place&quot; and reporting it immediately.<br>

I feel that anything sexual in nature does not belong in an elementry school library.  And of course I would hope that the schools would use judgement for age appropriateness in language and content in buying books for the library.  <br>
<br>
Public librarys should be able to have any books there are.  But just as the movie industry has a rating for age appropriateness, I would hope that little children arent allowed to check our mature audience books.  Since my kids are little they only check out what mom says is ok.<br>
<br>
My dh and I checked out some books on the Kama sutra and I am glad they were available, but I dont want my future 13 yo dtr or son to be checking out stuff like that.  There is a reason we are responsible for our kids until they are 18.  The adolescent brain isnt that great with making sound judgements in alot of stuff.<br>
<br>
Just because someone printed it doesnt mean it is appropriate and should be available in school libraries.  Adult public should be free to buy any book they want.<br>
<br>
