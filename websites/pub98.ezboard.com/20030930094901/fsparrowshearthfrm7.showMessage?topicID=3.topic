I will post each day, and start posting every other day like the other board unless you want it quicker?  But here you go, and it isn't my journal it's the journal that comes with the book, although I'm willing to answer questions, some of what I've written specifically in the journal is a little too personal to put online, please forgive me for not posting those.

IT ALL STARTS WITH GOD<br>
<br>
For everything, absolutely everything, above and below, visible and invisible…everything got started in him and finds its purpose in him.  Colossians 1:18 MSG<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: It’s not about me.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider: How can I remind myself today that life is really about living for God, not myself?<br>
<br>
The purpose of your life is far greater than your own personal fulfillment, your peace of mind, or even your happiness.  It’s far greater than your family, your career, or even your wildest dreams and ambitions.<br>
<br>
There is an alternative to speculation about the meaning and purpose of life.  It’s revelation.  We can turn to what God has revealed about life in His Word.  The easiest way to discover the purpose of an invention is to ask the creator of it.  The same is true for discovering your life’s purpose: ask God.<br>
<br>
God’s wisdom…goes deep into the interior of his purposes.  It’s not the latest message, but more like the oldest-what God determined as the way to bring out his best in us.  I Corinthians 2:7 MSG<br>
<br>
Prayer:<br>
Father,<br>
As I begin this journey, help me to realize that building my life around myself instead of you will only lead to emptiness and meaninglessness.  I was made by you and for you, and I want to discover my purpose in you.<br>

YOU ARE NOT AN ACCIDENT<br>
<br>
“I am your Creator. You were in my care even before you were born,” says the Lord. Isaiah 44:2 CEV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  I am not an accident.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Knowing that God created me for a purpose, what areas of my personality, background, and appearance do I need to accept?<br>
<br>
Long before you were conceived by your parents you were conceived in the mind of God.  It is not fate, nor chance, nor luck, nor coincidence that you are breathing at this very moment.  You are alive because God wanted to create you!<br>
<br>
O Lord, You saw me before I was born and scheduled each day of my life before I began to breathe.  Every day was recorded in you book!  Psalm 139:16 LB<br>
<br>
God made you to love you and you are His special creation.<br>
<br>
God was thinking of you even before He made the world!  In fact, that’s why He created it!  God designed this planet’s environment just so we could live in it.  We are the focus of His love, and the most valuable of all His creation.<br>
<br>
Long before he laid down earth’s foundations, He had us in mind, had settled onus as the focus of his love.  Ephesians 1:4 MSG<br>

WHAT DRIVES YOUR LIFE?<br>
<br>
You, Lord, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm and put their trust in you.  Isaiah 26:3 TEV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: Living on purpose is the path to peace.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What would my family and friends say is the driving force of my life?  What do I want it to be?<br>
<br>
Everyone’s life is driven by something.  Most dictionaries define the verb drive as “to guide, to control, or to direct.”  Whether you are driving a car, a nail, or a golf ball, you are guiding, controlling, and directing it at that moment.  What is the driving force in your life?<br>
<br>
Jesus said, “No one can serve two masters.”  Matthew 6:24<br>
<br>
More people are driven by guilt, resentment and anger, fear, materialism, or the expectations of others.  This journal will help you to live a purpose driven life – guided, controlled and directed by God’s purposes.  Nothing matters more than knowing God’s purposes for your life.<br>
<br>
We are all products of our past but we don’t have to be prisoners of it.  God’s purpose is not limited by your past.  He can turn a murderer (Moses) into a leader, a coward (Gideon) into a courageous hero, and he can do amazing things with the rest of your life.<br>
<br>
There are five great benefits of living a purpose driven life:<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Knowing your purpose gives your life meaning.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Knowing your purpose simplifies your life.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Knowing your purpose focuses your life.<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Knowing your purpose motivates your life, and<br>
•&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fulfilling your purpose will create an eternal legacy.<br>
<br>
Everyone wants to be remembered when they’re gone.  Ultimately, what matters most will not be what others say about your life, but what God says about you.  How will you answer God when he asks, “What did you do with my Son, Jesus Christ?” and “What did you do with what I gave you?”<br>
<br>
Remember, each of us will stand personally before the judgment seat of God.  Yes, each of us will have to give a personal account to God.  Romans 14:10, 12 NLT<br>
<br>
Father, I don’t want my life to be driven by anything but love for you.  Help me to center my life on your plan and purpose for me, and not worry about the expectation of others.<br>
<br>

MADE TO LAST FOREVER<br>
<br>
This world is fading away, along with everything it craves.  But if you do the will of God, you will live forever. I John 2:17 NLT<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: There’s more to life than just here and now.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Since everything has eternal consequences what is one thing I should stop doing and one thing I should start doing today?<br>
<br>
You have an inborn instinct that longs for immortality.  This is because God designed you, in his image, to live for eternity.  The reason we feel we should live forever is because God wired our brains with that desire!  God has planted eternity in the human heart (Ecclesiastes 3:11 NLT).<br>
<br>
Surely God would not have created such a being as man to exist only for a day!  No, no, man was made for immortality.  Abraham Lincoln.<br>
<br>
How you relate to God now on earth will determine where you spend eternity.  If you develop a relationship of love and trust in God through his Son Jesus Christ you’ll spend the rest of eternity with him.  When you live in light of eternity, your values change.  You use your time and money more wisely.  You place a higher premium on relationships and character instead of fame or wealth or achievements, or even fun.  Your priorities are reordered.  Keeping up with trends, fashions, and popular values, just doesn’t matter as much anymore.<br>
<br>
Paul wrote, “I once thought all these things were so very important, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done.”  Philippians 3:7 NLT<br>
<br>
God’s plans endure forever; his purposes last eternally.  Psalm 33:11 REV<br>
<br>
God has a purpose for your life on earth but it doesn’t end here.  His plan involves far more than the few decades you’ll spend on this planet.  It’s more than “the opportunity of a lifetime”; God offers you an opportunity beyond your lifetime.<br>
<br>
God open my eyes to see that there are eternal consequences in even the smallest choices of my life.  Remind me to look past what is temporary and focus on what will last forever.  Teach me to live in light of eternity.<br>

SEEING LIFE FROM GOD’S VIEW<br>
<br>
Unless you are faithful in small matters, you won’t be faithful in large ones.  Luke 16:10 NLT<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  Life is a test and a trust.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What has happened to me recently that I now realize was a test from God?  What are the greatest trusts God has entrusted to me?<br>
<br>
The Bible says life is a test, life is a trust, and life is a temporary assignment.  These ideas are the foundation of purpose driven living.  To fulfill the purposes God created you for, you’ll have to challenge conventional wisdom and replace it with the biblical metaphors of life.<br>
<br>
Do not conform yourselves to the standards of this world, but let God transform you inwardly by a complete change of your mind.  Then you will be able to know the will of God.  Romans 12:2 TEV<br>
<br>
When you understand that life is a test, you realize that nothing is insignificant in your life.  Even the smallest incident has significance for your character.  Every day is an important day, and every second is a growth opportunity to develop character, to demonstrate love, or to depend on God.  Some tests seem enormous and overwhelming while others you don’t even notice.  But all of them have eternal implications.<br>
<br>
Blessed are those who endure when they are tested.  When they pass the test, they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.  James 1:12 GW<br>
<br>
Never forget that everything in your life really belongs to God, your home, children, job—everything.  You’re just a caretaker, a trustee, a steward of it all.  It’s your privilege to enjoy it but it’s also your responsibility to faithfully use it the way God wants it used.<br>
<br>
Our culture says, “If you don’t own it, you won’t take care of it.”  But Christians live by a higher standard: “Because God owns it, I must take the best care of it that I can.”<br>
<br>
Those who are trusted with something valuable must show they are worthy of that trust.  I Corinthians 4:2 NCV<br>
<br>
At the end of your life on earth you’ll be evaluated and rewarded according to how well you handled what God entrusted to you.  That means everything you do, even simple daily chores, has eternal implications.  If you treat everything as a trust, God promises three rewards in eternity.  First, you’ll be given God’s affirmation: He’ll say, “Good job!  Well done!”  Next, you’ll receive a promotion and be given greater responsibility in eternity: “I will put you in charge of many things.”  Then, you’ll be honored with a celebration: “Come and share your Master’s happiness.”<br>
<br>
Gracious God, give me the wisdom to see life as you see it.  Help me to pass the test of character you place before me and to treat everything you give me *as a sacred* trust.  You own it all; I just get to use it while I’m on earth.<br>

LIFE IS A TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT<br>
<br>
We fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen.  For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.  II Corinthians 4:18 NIV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder: This world is not my home.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Since life on earth is just a temporary assignment, how should that change the way I live today?<br>
<br>
To make the best use of your life you must never forget two truths:  First, compared to eternity, life is brief.  Second, earth is only a temporary residence for you.  You won’t be here long, so don’t get too attached.  Ask God to help you see life on earth as he sees it.  With all the fascinating attractions, mesmerizing media, and enjoyable experiences available today, it’s easy to forget that the pursuit of happiness is not what life is about.  Only as we remember that life is a test, a trust, and a temporary assignment will the appeal of these things lose their grip on our lives.<br>
<br>
The things we see now are here today, gone tomorrow.  But the things we can’t see now will last forever.  II Corinthians 4:18 MSG<br>
<br>
In God’s eyes, the greatest heroes of faith are not those who achieve prosperity, success, and power in this life, but those who treat this life as a temporary assignment and serve faithfully expecting their promised reward in eternity.<br>
<br>
All these great people died in faith.  They did not get the things that God promised his people, but they saw them coming far in the future and were glad.  They said they were like visitors and strangers on earth.  They were looking forward to a better home in heaven.  That’s why God wasn’t ashamed for them to call him their God.  He even built a city for them.  Heberws 11:13, 16 NCV<br>
<br>
We fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen.  For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.  II Corinthians 4:18<br>
<br>
When life gets tough, when you’re overwhelmed with doubt, when you see evil prospering, or when you wonder if living for Christ is worth the effort, remember that you are not home yet.  At death you won’t leave home—you’ll go home.<br>
<br>
Lord, help me remember that there is more to life than just here and now.  Remind me to live like a temporary resident, not getting too attached to the things of this world because they are not what is going to last.<br>

THE REASON FOR EVERYTHING<br>
<br>
For everything comes from God alone.  Everything lives by his power, and everything is for his glory.  Romans 11:36 LB<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  It’s all for Him.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  How in my daily routine could I become more aware of God’s glory around me?<br>
<br>
The ultimate goal of the universe is to show the glory of God.  It is the reason for everything that exists, including you.  God made it all for his glory.  Living for God’s glory is the greatest achievement you can accomplish with your life.  God says, “They are my own people, and I created them to bring me glory.” (Isaiah 43:7 TEV), so it ought to be the supreme goal of our lives.<br>
<br>
Jesus honored God by fulfilling his purpose on earth.  We bring God glory the same way.<br>
<br>
There are many ways to bring glory to God but they can be summarized in God’s five purposes for your life.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We bring God glory by worshiping him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We bring God glory by loving other believers.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We bring God glory by becoming like Christ.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We bring God glory by serving others with our gifts.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We bring God glory by telling others about him.<br>
<br>
There are three secrets about the glory of God that most people miss.  First, when you trust Christ with your life, God puts his glory in you!  The second secret is that the more you focus on living for God’s glory, the more you will be filled with joy!  The third secret is that if you’ve committed your life to Jesus, one day you are going to share in God’s glory!  God repeatedly promises that if we live for his glory on earth, we’ll share his glory for eternity!<br>
<br>
Will you live for your own goals, comfort and pleasure, or will you live the rest of your life for God’s glory, knowing that he’s promised eternal rewards?  You may hesitate, wondering if you’ll have strength to live for God.  Don’t worry. Jesus will give you everything you need to live for him if you’ll just make the choice to do it.<br>
<br>
Everything that goes into a life of pleasing God has been miraculously given to us by getting to know, personally and intimately, the One who invited us to God.  II Peter 1:3 MSG<br>
<br>
Wonderful God, it is my deepest desire to bring you glory.  Help me to see your glory all around me today.  Nothing would exist without you.  It’s all for your glory! <br>

PLANNED FOR GOD’S PLEASURE<br>
<br>
The Lord takes pleasure in his people. Psalm 149:4 TEV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  I was planned for God’s pleasure.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What could I start doing today as if I was doing it for Jesus?<br>
<br>
Bringing pleasure to God is called worship.  It is the first and primary purpose of your life.  Anything you do that brings pleasure to God is an act of worship.  Like a diamond, worship is multifaceted.  Worship is a lifestyle.<br>
<br>
O Lord, you created everything, and it is for your pleasure that they exist and were created.  Revelation 4:11 NLT<br>
<br>
We worship for God’s benefit.  When we worship, our goal is to bring pleasure to God, not ourselves.  Worship isn’t for you.  It’s for God.  Of course, there are many benefits to worship, but we don’t worship to please ourselves.  Our motive is to bring glory and pleasure to our Creator.<br>
<br>
The Lord is pleased with those who worship him and trust his love.  Psalm 147:11 CEV<br>
<br>
Offer yourselves as a living sacrifice to God, dedicated to his service and pleasing to him.  This is the true worship that you should offer.  Romans 12:1 TEV<br>
<br>
Worship is not what you do with your lips; it’s what you do with your life.  All the singing, praying, and praising is worthless if it doesn’t lead to personal change and commitment.  You can’t be a spectator in worship.  Passive worship is an oxymoron.  Real worship is offering yourself to live for God’s pleasure.<br>
<br>
Father, thank you for creating me for your own pleasure!  I would not even exist if you hadn’t chosen to make me.  If I don’t get anything else done today, help me to know and love you a little bit more before I go to sleep tonight.  Help me to develop a lifestyle of worship.<br>

WHAT MAKES GOD SMILE?<br>
<br>
The Lord is pleased with those who worship him and trust his love.  Psalm 147:11 CEV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  God smiles when I trust Him.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Since God knows what’s best,  in what areas of my life do I need to trust him more?<br>
<br>
Since bringing pleasure to God is the first purpose of your life, your most important task is to discover how to do that.  Fortunately, the Bible gives a clear example of a life that gives pleasure to God.  The man’s name was Noah.  From his life, we learn the five acts of worship that make God smile.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp God smiles when we love him supremely.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp God smiles when we trust him completely.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp God smiles when we obey him wholeheartedly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp God smiles when we praise and thank him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp God smiles when we fulfill his purpose.<br>
<br>
This is what God wants most from you: a relationship!  God deeply loves you and desires your love in return.  He longs for you to know him and spend time with him.  He delights in you.  Building a relationship with God, and learning to love and be loved by him, should be the greatest objective of your life.  Nothing else even comes close in importance.<br>
<br>
Jesus said, “Love the Lord you God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.  This is the first and greatest commandment.”  Matthew 22:37-38 <br>
<br>
We please God by what we do and not only by what we believe.  James 2:24 CEV<br>
<br>
God’s Word is very clear that you can’t earn your salvation.  It is only by grace, not your effort.  But as a child of God you can bring pleasure to your heavenly Father through obedience.  Search through your Bible and make a list of the small obediences that God says bring him pleasure.  All of these can be acts of worship.  Why is obedience so pleasing to God?  Because it proves you really love him.<br>
<br>
Jesus said, “If you love me you will obey my commandments.”  John 14:15 TEV<br>
<br>
The Lord looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there were any who are wise, who want to please God.  Psalm 14:2 LB<br>
<br>
When you live in light of eternity, the question changes from “How much pleasure am I getting out of life?” to “How much pleasure is God getting out of my life?”  God is looking for people like Noah in the 21st century – people willing to live for the pleasure of God.  This lifestyle of worship is the only wise, sensible way to live.<br>
<br>
Figure out what will please Christ, and then do it.  Ephesians 5:10 MSG<br>
<br>
Dear God, I want my life to bring a smile to your face.  Empower me to love you supremely, trust you completely and obey you wholeheartedly today.<br>

THE HEART OF WORSHIP<br>
<br>
Give yourselves to God… surrender your whole being to him to be used for righteous purposes.  Romans 8:13 TEV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  The heart of worship is surrender.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  What area of my life am I holding back from God?  What am I afraid of?<br>
<br>
Surrendering to God is the heart of worship.  True worship—bringing God pleasure—happens when you give yourself completely to God.  Offering yourself to God is what worship is all about.  This act of personal surrender is called many things: consecration, making Jesus Lord, taking up your cross, dying to self, yielding to the Spirit.  What matters is that you do it, not what you call it.  God wants your life.  All of it, 95% is not enough.<br>
<br>
Trust is an essential ingredient to surrender.  You won’t surrender to God unless you trust him, but you can’t trust him until you know him better.  Fear keeps us from surrendering but love casts out all fear.  The more you realize how much God loves you, the easier surrender becomes.  God is a Lover and a Liberator, and surrendering brings freedom, not bondage.  When we completely surrender ourselves to Jesus, we discover that he is not a tyrant but a Savior; not a boss, but a brother; not a dictator, but a friend.<br>
<br>
Surrendering is best demonstrated in obedience; cooperating with your Creator.  You say, “Yes Lord” to whatever he asks of you.  The supreme example of self-surrender is Jesus.  The night before his crucifixion Jesus surrendered himself to God’s plan.  He prayed, “Father, everything is possible for you.  Please take this cup of suffering away from me.  Yet I want your will, not mine.” (Mark 14:36 NLT).  Genuine surrender says, “Father, if this problem, pain, sickness, or circumstance is needed to fulfill your purpose and glory in my life or in another’s, please don’t take it away!”<br>
<br>
Give yourselves completely to God.  James 4:7 NEV<br>
<br>
If God is going to do his deepest work in you, it will begin with surrender.  So give it all to God, your past regrets, your present problems, your future ambitions, your fears, dreams, weaknesses, habits, hurts, and hang-ups.  Put Christ in the driver’s seat of your life and take your hands off the steering wheel.  Don’t be afraid, nothing under his control can ever be out of control.  Mastered by Christ, you can handle anything.<br>
<br>
The heart of worship is surrender.<br>
<br>
Dear loving Father, when I think of all you’ve done for me, I want to surrender all my life to your will.  I want to give up my need to control things and trust in you instead.  Help me to hold back nothing from you today.<br>

BECOMING BEST FRIENDS WITH GOD<br>
<br>
Friendship with God is reserved for those who reverence him.  Psalm 25: 14 LB<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  God wants to be my best friend.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  How could I remind myself to talk to God more often throughout my days?<br>
<br>
Adam and Eve enjoyed an intimate friendship with God.  Unhindered by guilt or fear, they delighted in God and he delighted in them.  We were made to live in the environment of God’s continual presence, but after the Fall that ideal relationship was lost.  Yet because Jesus secured our salvation and left his Holy Spirit in us, we all can become friends of God now.  Since still his enemies, we will certainly be delivered from eternal punishment by his life (Romans 5:10 NLT).<br>
<br>
Now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God – all because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done for us in making us friends of God.  Romans 5:11 NLT<br>
<br>
Friendship with God is built by sharing all your life experiences with him.  God wants to be more than an appointment in your schedule.  He wants to be included in every activity, every conversation, every problem, and even tragedies, challenges, routines, highs and lows.  You build a friendship with God the same way: by spending time together interacting, talking, listening, and going through a variety of circumstances together.<br>
<br>
It’s impossible to be God’s friend apart from knowing what he says.  You can’t love God unless you know him, and you can’t know him without knowing his Word.  While you cannot spend all day studying the Bible, you can think about it throughout the day, recalling verses you’ve read or memorized, and mulling them over in your mind.  The reason God considered Job and David close friends was because they valued and esteemed his Word above everything else, and they thought about it continually throughout the day.<br>
<br>
Oh, Lord, how I love your law!  I meditate on it all day long.  Psalm 11:97<br>
<br>
A third way to build a friendship with God is by being honest with him.  God expects honesty, not perfection.  If perfection was a requirement, none of us could ever be friends of God.  None of God’s friends in the Bible were perfect.  We’re only his friends by grace.  Jesus is still the “friend of sinners” (Matthew 11:19).  In the Bible, the friends of God were honest about their feelings.  God, however, didn’t seem to be bothered by this frankness; in fact, he encouraged it.<br>
<br>
Knowing and loving God is our greatest privilege, and being known and loved is God’s greatest pleasure.<br>
<br>
Jesus, forgive me for being too busy to develop a friendship with you.  I want to develop a running dialogue, a continual conversation with you throughout the day.<br>

DEVELOPING YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH GOD<br>
<br>
Draw close to God, and God will draw close to you.  James 4:8 NLT<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  I’m as close to God as I choose to be.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider: What choices will I make today in order to grow closer to God?<br>
<br>
To instruct us in candid honesty, God gave us the book of Psalms –a worship manual, full of ranting, raving, doubts, fears, resentments, and deep passions combined with thanksgiving, praise, and statements of faith.  Every possible emotion is catalogued in the Psalms.  When you read the emotional confessions of David and others, realize this is how God wants you to worship him – holding back nothing of what you feel.<br>
<br>
He offers his friendship to the godly. Proverbs 3:32 NLT<br>
<br>
You build a friendship with God by caring about what God cares about.  This is what friends do – they care about what is important to the other person.  The more you become God’s friend, the more you will care about the things God cares about, grieve over the things God grieves over, and rejoice over the things that bring pleasure to God.  What does God care about most?  He wants all his lost children found!  That’s the whole reason Jesus came to earth.  The dearest thing to the heart of God is the death of his Son.  The second dearest thing is when his children share that with others.<br>
<br>
O Lord, your love means more than life to me.  Psalm 63:3 CEV<br>
<br>
You build a friendship with God by desiring it more than anything else.  Intimate friendship with God is a choice, not an accident.  You must intentionally seek it.  Do you really want it – more than anything?  You may have been passionate about God in the past but you’ve lost that desire.  To re-ignite your passion for God, start asking God to give it to you, and keep on asking until you have it.  Pray this throughout your day.<br>
<br>
Dear Jesus, more than anything else, I want to get to know you intimately.<br>
<br>
Jesus, I want a deeper relationship with you.  Help me to be completely honest with my feelings and my faults.  Nothing matters more than my relationship to you.<br>

WORSHIP THAT PLEASES GOD<br>
<br>
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.  Mark 12:30<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder:  God wants all of me.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  Which is more pleasing to God right now – my public worship or my private worship?  What will I do about this?<br>
<br>
God-pleasing worship is based on Scripture.  Real worship is rooted in the Word; it’s based on truth, not our imagination.  God-pleasing worship is also from the heart.  Made in God’s image, you are a spirit that resides in a body and God designed your spirit to communicate with him.  Worship is our spirit responding to God’s Spirit.<br>
<br>
Let us be grateful and worship God in a way that will please him, with reverence and awe.  Hebrews 12:28 TEV<br>
<br>
God-pleasing worship is thoughtful.  Reading Scripture in different translations and paraphrases will expand your expressions of worship.  Try praising God without using the words praise, hallelujah, thanks, or amen.  Make a list of synonyms and use fresh words like admire, respect, value, revere, honor, and appreciate.  Be specific.  You’d rather receive two specific compliments than 20 vague generalities.  So would God.  Another idea is to make a list of the different names of God and focus on them.  God’s names are not arbitrary; they tell us about different aspects of his character.  And God commands us to praise his name.  <br>
<br>
God-pleasing worship is sacrificial.  Real worship costs.  One thing worship costs us is our self-centeredness.  You cannot exalt God and yourself at the same time.  You don’t worship to be seen by others or to please yourself.  You deliberately shift the focus off yourself.  When Jesus said, “Love God with all your strength” he pointed out that worship takes effort and energy.  It is always convenient or comfortable, and sometimes worship is a sheer act of the will – a willing sacrifice.<br>
<br>
I will not offer to the Lord my God sacrifices that have cost me nothing.  II Samuel 24:24 TEV<br>
<br>
Praise him from sunrise to sunset.  Psalm 113:3 LB<br>
<br>
God pleasing worship is continual.  Praise should be the first activity when you open your eyes in the morning and when you close them at night.  Worship is not a part of your life, it is your life, and every activity can be transformed into an act of worship when you do it for the praise, glory, and pleasure of God.<br>
<br>
Worship is the first purpose of your life.  It is our greatest responsibility, our highest privilege, and it should take priority over everything else.<br>
<br>
Father, I want to bring you pleasure today by loving you with all my heart and mind and soul and strength.  Help me to identify and develop the sacred pathway that fits how you created me to know you.<br>

WHEN GOD SEEMS DISTANT<br>
<br>
<br>
God said, “I will never leave you; I will never abandon you.” Hebrews 13:5 TEV<br>
<br>
Point to Ponder God is real, no matter how I feel.<br>
<br>
Question to Consider:  How do I intend to stay focused on God even when He feels distant?<br>
<br>
Friendships are often tested by separation and silence.  In your friendship with God, you won’t always feel close to him.  The deepest level of worship is praising God in spite of pain, thanking God during a trial, trusting God when tempted, surrendering while suffering, and loving God when he seems distant. <br>
<br>
Any relationship involves times of closeness and times of distance, and in a relationship with God, no matter how intimate, the pendulum will swing from one side to the other.  Philip Yancey.<br>
<br>
God has promised repeatedly, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” (Hebrews 13:5).  But God has not promised, “You will always feel my presence.”  In fact, God admits that sometimes he hides his face from us.  There will be times when God appears to be MIA, missing-in-action, in your life.  It’s a normal part of the testing and maturing of your friendship with God.  Every single Christian goes through it at least once, and usually several times.  It’s painful and disconcerting, but it is absolutely vital for the development of your faith.<br>
<br>
Faith develops when you don’t feel anything.<br>
<br>
God’s omnipresence and the manifestation of his presence are two different things.  One is a fact; the other is often a feeling.  God is always present, even when you’re unaware of him, and his presence is too profound to be measured by mere emotion.  Yes, he wants you to sense his presence, but he’s more concerned that you trust him than that you feel him.  Faith, not feelings, pleases God.<br>
<br>
Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will depart.  The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away, may the name of the Lord be praised.  Job 1:20-21<br>
<br>
How do you praise God when you don’t understand what’s happening in your life and God is silent?  You do what Job did.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tell God exactly how you feel.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Focus on who God is – his unchanging nature.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trust God to keep his promises.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Remember what God has already done for you.<br>
<br>
When you feel abandoned by God, yet continue to trust him in spite of your feelings, you will worship God in the deepest way.<br>
<br>
God when I don’t hear your voice or feel your presence, help me to seek you, not a feeling.  Then help me remember your promise that you will never leave me or forsake me.<br>
