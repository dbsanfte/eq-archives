<h3>A GOLD Dragon Lies Beneath!</h3>
</a>
I took the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/teo592/quiz/dragon.html" target="new">Inner Dragon online quiz</a> and found out I am a Gold Dragon on the inside. My Inner Dragon is the most honorable of all. Golds are the third rarest of all the dragons (after Platinum and Chromatic dragons) and have a station in society that reflects their rarity. I am what one might call a Draconic Knight. Golds live by a strict code of chivalry and commitment. Remember Draco? Yep, Gold Dragon. My appearance is fearsome and all-mighty but I'd never stoop so low as to bring any harm to a human. I'm one of only two dragon types that are aligned "Lawful Good" and demonstrate great magical proficiency. My piety, beauty, wisdom, and inner strengrth are absolutely without parallel.<br><br>

Of course, being a Gold  Dragon isn't all high ethics and codes. I like to fly around scaring things, advise humans in their affairs, and shapeshift. Strike that, I <b>LOVE</b> to shapeshift. And I'm great at it. In fact, who's to say I'm not really a Gold Dragon after all? My favorable attributes are honor, truth, kindness, gold, wisdom, bravery, and trustworthiness. If anyone threatens or tries to kill me, I could strike back with my breath weapon - Fire. But then, no one's tried anything that stupid in the last couple thousand years. After all, I'm about 54 feet long.<br><br>

I am a A StarShield Dragon!

Hey, I took the http://dragonhame.com online Inner Dragon quiz and found out I am a StarShield Dragon on the inside. 

In the war between good and evil, StarShield Dragons take the side of the noble and good....
When it comes to the powers of Chaos vs. those of Law and Order, your inner dragon tends to do things by the book. ...
As far as magical tendancies, a StarShield Dragon's nature does not lend itself well to the ways of Magic....
During combat situations, a true StarShield Dragon prefers to defeat opponents by the use of spells and other tactics....
The StarShield Dragon appears as the darkest midnight blue, with each of it's scales containing small reflective shards that refract and concentrate light into small star-like beams. StarShield dragons are fast graceful creatures.'
StarShield dragons often make their homes in remote areas, often in the far north or south where the weather is cold and human settlements are few and far between.'
These dragons are nocturnal, only coming out at night. They mostly keep their distance from humans, and spend their time enjoying the comforts of nature. StarShield dragons see well at night and can sometimes be seen hunting during a full moon. StarShield dragons are mysterious in nature and seem to have a direct link with the universe about them, they are known far and wide as the bringers of good fortune.
'
This Dragons favorite elements are: open spaces, opals, and wisdom
