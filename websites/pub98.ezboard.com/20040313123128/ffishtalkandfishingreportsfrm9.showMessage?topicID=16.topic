Ind.</span><hr size=1> Ranger361V is correct in his description of the location.  I've never fished it, but I work with a guy who fishes that lake exclusively during the summer for the Muskie.  He says there are few bass to be had, but it's not known to be one of the better bass lakes in the area.  He also mentioned that the lake is usually weed covered and fairly clear.  From his description on one of his outings this past summer was that the weeds were gone it it was all sturred up.  He did end up winning the big muskie tournament they held there this year, with a 48 incher.  That muskie was caught out of James lake that is near by.  <br>
I've seen Webster, but it's been a couple years.  I fished that Tri State Wildlife area there.  Goldeneye is a stone throw away from Webster.  You can actually see if from the parking lot.  Goldeneye is a small lake that is full of timber within the park, and there is also Shock and Spear lake located in there too.  I've fished them all, and would venture to say that you would be better off fishing them for bass than Webster.  Electric motor only on those lakes, and they have a 18 inch minimum size limit on the bass.  Roughly Goldeneye is about 30 acres, and Shock and Spear are in the 50 to 70 acre range.  If your trophy hunting bass they are worth a try.  I spoke with one of the DNR guys who said he caught a 21 inch largemouth fly fishing in the spring of 2001.  I would probably fish them more, but they are just too far of a drive for me.   <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rdvtavssvjnm/BASS/BASSx.html">

Viperbass tells me the Barbie Chain is decent for bass and muskie.  It's also extremely close to Webster.  IMO the <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;font-family:times new roman;">Tri-County State Fish &amp; Wildlife Area</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> is the your best bet to catch lots of fish.  It's viewable from Webster lake.  Has at least a dozen different small bodies of water to fish on it.  Shock, Spear, Goldeneye, and several smaller ones.  They are all electric motor only and within 5 minutes of Webster Lake.  Some are full of timber while others have vast amounts of lilies to fish.  Shock and Spear have some flats that hold decent fish.  Best fishing is right along the drop offs.  The access sites are top notch compared to other Indiana public access sites.  The choices are unlimited.  The only catch is that theres a 18 inch and 2 fish limit on those lakes for bass.  Which is understandable given the size of each.  This aggressive management helps give every Angler the opportunity at many bass on every trip.  <br>
<br>
Have a excellent trip, and let us know how the fishing was when you get back.  If you would like a few more public lakes in the area that provide for gas motors.  Let me know and I will put some more on here with a 20 mile radius.<br>

Other lakes in the area are Dewart, Tippecanoe, Cedar Lake, Palestine, Loon, and Blue Lake.  I would say it's safe to say all those are within 20 miles of Webster.  Just stop at the nearest tackle shop, and they can point you in the right direction.  You can also stop by Walmart and pick up maps for the lakes in the area back in the fishing section.
