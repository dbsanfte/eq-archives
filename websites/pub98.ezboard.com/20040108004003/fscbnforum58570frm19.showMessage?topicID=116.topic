This was nothing like Ireland.  She missed the rolling hills and the smell of Heather.  Dublin was the place to be, off the coast there was the school of music where she studied.  She missed the attendtion she got over there.  Not very many people had heard of her in the US.  She didn't even have a study gig.  Every once in a while she would play for her kindred but it was becoming old.  They weren't really into Irish Folk.  Only one understood her when she spoke galic.  She had a hard time remembering his name.  He liked him though.  He was good sport.  Although, he couldn't read or write and didn't want to learn, he was intelligent.  She wondered downtown Santa Carla with her Martin's backpaker on her back.  Vicious had been kind enough to give her some ideas of where she might start looking for places to play.  <br>
  That is when she found this place. She turned back to the street where she found her car and pulled out an amp.  She lugged it into the bar.  And started setting up.  She only had to make one more trip to the car to get the mic and stand and of course her gutiar.<br>
Once things were set up she sat quitely and watched the people talking and ordering drinks.  She wanted to get a feel of who she was singing to.  The gutiar that she had tonight was not the same one she wandered with in the streets.  This one had a pick-up in it, with an equalizer.  She pick up the gutiar and admired it's beauty. Then she plugged the amp in.  It squelled at firt until she adjusted the picth.  She tested the mic out and made sure that there was an equal balance of sound from that and her gutiar.  &quot;Good even' to ya&quot; she said her Irish lilt was noticable. She waited until people quited down a bit before she started again, &quot;I wanted to let you know that you all are the first people to see me play outside of Ireland.  It is a honor to be here.  Thank you for this.&quot;  Then she started playing. She entranced the crowd and they apluaded.  She smiled inside but always wondered if it was really her own talent that they were apluding or the talent of the night that she inherited when she was turned. What did it matter, they were hers.  <br>
  At the end of the night she saw this man at the bar.  He barely looked old enough to be buying drinks.  She smiled, this one would be her first groupie. She walked over to him and said, &quot;Are you even old enough to drink?&quot; He smiled at her and said. &quot;I am 30.&quot;  <br>
 &quot;I can't believe it you're my age!&quot;  Rose lied and smiled.  &quot;Can I keep you?&quot; she said mischiviously.<br>
&quot;Sure.&quot; he said.  And he helped her load her equipment back into her car.  She took him to a small apartment that was only a couple of blocks away.  While in the process of his passion, she fed.  The eternal heartbeat she heard in his moans. When he was completely worn.  She smiled as he laid in a bed she called hers.  She left a rose on the pillow. Then she crept to her hiding place away from the sun.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=116.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=116.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=116.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=116.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=116.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm20">SchreckNET™ (Nos only)<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
