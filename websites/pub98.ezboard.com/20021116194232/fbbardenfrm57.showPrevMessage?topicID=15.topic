In this age of sexual equality where most women can do pretty much anything they choose, what do people feel about women being involved in sports like boxing?<br>
<br>
Would you find it disturbing or upsetting to watch a woman taking part in a boxing match? Would it disturb you more seeing a woman getting injured during boxing, than it would if it were a man? Do you think female boxing should be allowed?<br>
<br>
Also, some armies such as Israels allow women to fight on the front line, how do you feel about this? Would you want the army in your country to allow women to fight on the front line?<br>
<br>
Are there limits to sexual equality, things you feel women just shouldn't do? <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003399><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/ubbarden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bbarden</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.bbarden.com/userfiles/bb-icon.jpg" BORDER=0> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/userfiles/bb-squares-60x60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Lead Editor & Designer<br /><img src='http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-4-6.gif' /></span><br>  ezSupporter<br> Posts: <b>5710</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#99CCFF>Posted: 7/3/02 5:32:49 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: Should women do things like boxing and frontline fightin</span><hr size=1> I don't see why women who want to do boxing should be held back - but then I can't see why people want to box anyway, regardless of their sex!!<br>
<br>
I don't think that mixed sex boxing would work though.  Yes, you get women who are stronger than a lot of men, but it could be dangerous to do mixed sex boxing.<br>
<br>
That said, less physically aggressive sports could have mixed sex teams.<br>
<br>
(Sorry... I have an opinion, but not too much knowledge about all this...)<br>

So yes, women should of course be allowed.<br>
<br>
Front Line fighting is altogether different. The decision isn't just about whether you want to do it or not, its whether you are properly equipped and able for battle.  You need the be the absolute best. Now although this does not mean women are automatically excluded - a procedure where you require troops to at their absolute max does mean that 99.99% of all women are excluded. It's unavoidable. Most reasonable people would not find me sexist for saying that on average women are physically less able then men. In a world where physical condition is everything, women that are unable to hack it as well as the top men, should not be allowed to fight. Not just women of course... the majority of male recruits also.<br>
<br>
Should we come to a stage where increasingly less physically able soldiers were needed(in time of war, when the reserves get called up for instance), women will increasingly be fit enough to be physically equal to men. So by my reasoning more and more women would get involved in front line fighting.<br>
<br>
So yes, in theory they should be allowed, but in practice it would be unlikely that many women were fielded.<br>

Is it really so important to be in the BEST condition?  <br>
<br>
Personally, I'd rather see a bunch of weaklings who are so zealous about their country that they're willing to go berzerker with automatic weapons on the frontline... that way the strong ones are left for the long haul.<br>
<br>
But I know very little about war, so I could be wrong. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003399><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/usilvaranger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SilvaRanger</A> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www.aowm60.dsl.pipex.com/smallfairy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Shimmering Ocean<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-5.gif /></span><br>  ezSupporter<br> Posts: <b>1732</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#99CCFF>Posted: 7/5/02 6:42:03 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: Should women do things like boxing and frontline fightin</span><hr size=1> Hummm Interesting views. I think my views o nthis must be very old fashioned indeed. Rationally I cant see any reason why women shouldnt do these things, unless they are pregnant or something. But on an emotional instictive, gut repsonse kind of level, which I tend to use a fair bit, I just very much dislike the idea of women doing boxing.<br>
<br>
I dislike boxing anyway, because it is so upsetting to see people getting hurt, but to see women do it, and getting punched would upset me more than if it were a man, I cant explain why. And the idea of mixed sex boxing is really competely repulsive to me, maybe because I was brought up to believe that men shouldnt hit women, I don't know. I mean, just the thought of a man having a boxing match with a woman and going all out to win it, just appalls me.  <br>
<br>
As for front line fighting, well I dont have such strong feelings about that as I do about boxing, but it does worry me some, like kids loosing a mother from it, but then kids loose their fathers from it, is there a difference? Is a mother more important than a father?<br>
<br>
And women do tend to have things like menstruation, would that cause problems in front line combat possibly?<br>
<br>
I definitely think women that are or might be pregnant shouldnt fight on the front line.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I completely agree with Dash on the men being more able than women physically, doesn't that depend on the condition and the training of the person?<br>
<br>
In modern warfare in some cases physical condition isn't quite so important as it was anyway, but then I did say frontline fighting so I guess i nthat it is a factor, but then you also want someone with mental strenght and courage, and intelligence, so it sint the be all and end all. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#200985><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/udashofmilk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DashOfMilk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.users.dialstart.net/~dashland/html/parent.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www.users.dialstart.net/~dashland/html/lene1b.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Shimmering Ocean<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-5.gif /></span><br>  Posts: <b>1877</b><br></td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#99CCFF>Posted: 7/5/02 10:01:22 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: Should women do things like boxing and frontline fightin</span><hr size=1> What I'm saying is that biologically men are physically stronger then women. I dont mean that in a sexist way at all... it's just the ways our bodies are built.<br>
<br>
Modern warfare does require the highest level of fitness. Even if it wasn't neccesary, you'd still want the ABSOLUTE best people. The more like super(wo)men they are, the better.<br>
<br>
On the interesting topic of whether a mother is more important then a father. I ,oddly - as a guy, believe that mothers are more important. This does not mean I love my dad any less... or dont owe my dad as much as my mom. It's difficult explaining, but there is something of an animal instinct with the need for a mother.. I cant put my finger on what exactly... there just is. A child has to be brought up around a mother... no two ways about it. <br>
Having said that, I believe that all children should be brought up by two mixed sex parents anyway. If this is interesting, maybe we'll start a new topic on this.<br>

if girls are willing to participate, i dont see any problems in them playing boxing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
boxing is a sports with strict rules and referee, not a fight...<br>
boxing restricts weight ranges for the boxers, which seems fair to me...<br>
even though i dont enjoy watching it and probably i will never play boxing in my life ( <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), other girls might make different choices and have different preferences<br>
<br>
<br>
as for the frontline battle, i agree with dash...<br>
i am a girl and i dont try to be minor... i do believe in sexual equality, but that doesnt mean that we have built equally, and have equal physical capacity...<br>
<br>
i have read an article about frontline battle a while ago...<br>
the article also talked about how women are generally less fit than men... <br>
frontline fighters dont actually fight frontline all the time...they are being rotated upon schedule... <br>
not only they are in combat, but also, they walk long distance, build shelter or bunker ( when needed ), and carry heavy things... <br>
the over all test result shows that the average female soliders are proven to be less physically fit than the average male soliders...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  hehe my own conclusion is... <br>
war is matter of life and death... i dont consider a gender as a determining point in whether to send whom to frontline...<br>
<br>
as dash said, the very best people go to frontline... regardless of gender <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/grin.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
