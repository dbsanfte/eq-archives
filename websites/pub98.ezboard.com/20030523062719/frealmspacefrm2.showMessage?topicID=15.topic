He makes his way to the bar, not really paying attention to what Eldons' doing.  Cannon places a left elbow on the hard wood, turns right, and says, &quot;So, it's a nice day outside...if not a bit chilly.&quot;  He, nonchalantly, aims this more at the bartender than the other EMPTY tables in the house.<br>
<br>
The bartender looks a lil bit indifferent at the cowled mage, then says, &quot;So?  What is it of ye?  All I know is that ye cost me money.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well....,&quot; Cannon begins by placing a handful of GOLD coins--which, to Eldon, came from NOWHERE in particular--on the tabletop, &quot;you can describe, and DETAIL, those Knights that we fought last night.  I'm sorry if I'm being too direct, but my friend's lives' are in jeopardy...and I figure that your intellect could be of assistance to those of dire need.....please.&quot;<br>

Looking him up and down you can scarce believe it is him! Dressed in black clothing underneath Plate Armor and holding a Helm in one hand and adjusting his swordbelt with the other hand. You see that he has his short sword at his belt along with his pouches. A Long sword is slung over his shoulder attached to another belt. Nodding to you he moves outside to his horse and straps the long sword to the saddle and then pulls his black tattered &quot;Blackstaff&quot; cloak out of a saddlebag and then throws it over his shoulders and then secures it with a black gemmed brooch. Swinging up into the saddle, Dandalus kicks his mount into action and moves quickly through the streets.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/brealmspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cannondothmoria>Cannon Dothmoria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Big Bombad!</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#FF9300>(1/28/03 3:42:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What Eldon's not saying......</span><hr size=1> Cannon blinks at the armored form of Dandalus.....<br>
<br>
He stares blankly at the door after watching the spectacle of Dan in full armor prancing through and closing it behind him.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>If I was a Duke about to enter in this contest that is going to start shortly, where would I be,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Cannon thinks to himself.  The answer should be a simple one.  Yet, if Duke Bornhelm was planning to injure / maim / kill Dandalus, then he would probably be playing background and waiting for the right time to strike.  That is, unless he would have his minions do it.  OR, he could have just hired some thugs to do it for him, so this whole conspiracy could not be traced back to the Duke.  <br>
<br>
He gets pulled from his thoughts upon smelling a peculiar, sweet smell, and turns to see Eldon sipping from--what could only be--his personal flask.  Eldon leans back in his stool and let's out a resigned &quot;AAAaaahhhhhhh....&quot;  <br>
<br>
Noticing Cannon's interest, the shaggy halfling holds up the leather flask and asks merrily, &quot;Would you like to try?  Shire Durkin's finest, I say!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a resounding sigh, Cannon let's the question of how that drink endured the whole few-thousand-mile trip from his homeland drop like a sack of potatoes from a 7 story tower.  Cannon has more pressing issues.  <br>
<br>
&quot;OK,&quot; he begins.  &quot;Eldon, let us go to the tournament grounds and see when the Duke and Lord Dran have there matches.&quot;  They make their way out of Dawn's First with a fair well to the still-foul-mannered barkeep.<br>
<br>
On their way, Cannon relates more detail of the plan to Eldon.  &quot;When they are not in contest, we will trail them.  I will take the Duke.  You can take Lord Dran....&quot;<br>
<br>
Eldon immediately cuts him off, &quot;What if I want to take the Duke and you're stuck with Lord Dran.  I think Duke Bornhelm is a much more flavorful person, and his red hair is sssoooo funny!  It looks like a lit torch!......&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;ELDON!  I am taking the Duke, and that's final!&quot;  Inside, Cannon cannot stop from laughing at this lil halfling.  &quot;Alright.....we can't make it too obvious that they're being followed, however......&quot;<br>

By this time, Cannon and Eldon make it to the tourny grounds and immediately begin looking for the match lists.  While looking for the extensive lists, Cannon says to Eldon, &quot;Once we find out where those 2 are going to be, we can split.  We will meet every hour throughout the day....,&quot; Cannon begins looking around until his eyes fall on a small fruit shop.  &quot;We will meet THERE every hour to report anything we find.&quot;  Thinking this could be a bad move, as Eldon is liable to tell every little detail about every little thing he would come across, Cannon adds, &quot;Eldon, we need to find out anything we can about how those gentlemen, Duke Bornhelm and Lord Dran, are going to conspire against my friends.  Ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
With an excited nod, Eldon says, &quot;Yah!&quot;  He winks, and adds, &quot;Gotcha!&quot;   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/brealmspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cannondothmoria>Cannon Dothmoria</A> at: 1/28/03 5:43:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/brealmspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dandalus>dandalus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www1.theforce.net/jc/icons/expandeduniverse/nomanor_logo.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#FF9300>(1/28/03 9:59:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What Eldon's not saying......</span><hr size=1> Once at the Lists you notice that Duke Bornhelm has already competed for this day of the tournament and has advanced in the rankings for tomorrow. After scouring the areas, you notice that everyone is at the swordplay competition now. You see Torrel taking a beating from a tall lean man with a whip and longsword. Dandalus in his plate armor and Wang with his bow over his shoulder cheer Torrel on. You see Duke Bornhelm and Lord Dran across the way watching the fight idly but keeping an eye on Dandalus who seems oblivious. A black robed man keeps shouting the glories of Kelemvor scaring not a few people away from him. All this talk of the God of the Dead has a negative effect on the crowd around the man and they look at the man as less of a holy man and more of a threat. Everytime Torrel scores a hit the black robed man screams, &quot;SEE THE GLORY OF KELEMVORS CHOSEN! THE FAITHFUL SHALL OVERCOME THE FAITHLESS!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Dandalus along with half the crowd looks unnerved by this crazed zealot. Eldon looks on in interest at the fight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/frealmspacefrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=15.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/frealmspacefrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=15.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/frealmspacefrm2.threadControl?topicID=15.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/frealmspacefrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/frealmspacefrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="realmspacefrm1">Announcements<option value="realmspacefrm2">Forgotten Realms (I.C.)<option value="realmspacefrm8">Star Wars (O.O.C)<option value="realmspacefrm10">Star Wars (I.C.)<option value="realmspacefrm9">Forgotten Realms (O.O.C)<option value="realmspacefrm7">Character Close-ups<option value="realmspacefrm6">Archives<option value="realmspacefrm11">Everquest?!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/brealmspace>Realmspace</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/frealmspacefrm2>Forgotten Realms (I.C.)</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
