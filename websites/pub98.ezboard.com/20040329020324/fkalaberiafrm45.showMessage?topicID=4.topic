It was late at night around one am and the people showed no signs of going to bed. The party inside was just getting started as Vampires walked with their brethren, the men showing off their female property. Unlike times of old, vampires now showed no fear or restraint from letting the mortal world know they existed. Of course there was nothing humans could do about New York because the sun would never shine again here upon this place once so free.<br>
<br>
The doors to the club burst open as a rather large muscular man flew out onto the streets followed by curious onlookers. Amoung them was a well build, medium height young man with messed up hair. The look on his face showed no emotion as he straddled the bigger man and began to pumble his face in. &quot;I warned you that you had better leave before but you wouldn't listen.&quot; his voice was calm as the larger man got up and shoved him off before further damage could be done.<br>
<br>
&quot;Piss off ya wanker!&quot; the large man yelled. &quot;I just wanted a piece of bird.&quot; his accent was thickly british.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah well Charlie, bloody fuck off ya tosser since this is a high class bar and no free tarts!&quot; the younger man yelled back as he removed his leather jacket to reveal his well toned form under a black muscle shirt. &quot;I'm the bouncer here, I decide what goes and since you got a problem with it mate, I've got a problem with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young man moved quickly, his fangs flashing between his smirking lips as he did a spinning heel kick. His foot connected with a blood spraying crunch to the larger man's face, smashing the man's jaw to the side. More damage followed as the young man punched the bigger man in the gut to double him over before measuring the now stooped form for a vicious jump kick to the head. The large man rose off the ground as everything seemed to come to a standstill, only the young man moving very quickly under the airborn man.<br>
<br>
There was another sickening crunch as the bouncer gave the large man an uppercut to the spine before he could even hit the ground. All this happened in a matter of seconds that only a vampire could have seen clearly. To all the mortals, everything would have seemed like a blur.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go back to England mate... tell your blokes there that if any of them try to come back for me, well my name is Zack.&quot; the young man spat on the broken vampire at his feet. &quot;I'll show them all the same hospitality I showed you.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, the young man picked up his jacket and headed towards the back of the club were he light up a cig. With his back to the wall, he smoked slowly, smiling for the smoke calmed his nerves. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Fucking assholes... whats with them anyway trying to bust up the joint. No one gets special treatment if you step outta line... no matter what you are...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>

Her green eyes widened in fear as she watched the two vampires pummel each other in the middle of the street. Not even bothering to worry about anyone interfering, they fought viciously, their movements becoming a blur to her mortal eyes.<br>
<br>
From where she crouched hidden she could clearly hear their conversation and noticed the one named Zack gain the upper hand, ending the fight as quickly as it had begun. She watched as he picked up his jacket and sauntered off, back the way he'd first come.<br>
<br>
With her heart pounding she crept back down to her hiding place at the bottom of the stairs, praying they wouldn't find her tonight, for it was too risky to try and move to another place now. <br>
<br>
As she sat there in the dark, bits of conversations floated through her head....'TOMMY!..how could you kill them..they were human,' She reached up lightly running her fingertips along her bruised cheek, 'SHUTUP...if you don't like it...leave,' he'd told her. Shaking her head, Jayden didn't want to relive the following scene. There were too many other things to worry about tonight, like would she live through the night, hiding this close to a Vamp bar. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/2/03 7:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> &quot;Hmmmm great fight out there Zack.&quot; swooned a lovely brunette with dark eyes and fangs as Zack shouldered his way back into the bar. &quot;You sure showed that brit a good time!&quot;<br>
<br>
Zack smiled as she wrapped her arm around his neck and kissed his cheek. &quot;Did I ever tell you I liked it rough to?&quot; she continued, her voice rising for a second towards the end as Zack scouped her up in his strong arms. &quot;I think you might have but... with such a flower like you, I wouldn't want to be to rough mon joli.&quot; Zack replied with his natural french accent.<br>
<br>
&quot;As much as I would enjoy having you in my arms, perhaps later for right now I need to get back to work.&quot; He set her down carefully on her feet with a reluctant smile on his face. &quot;I'll be around.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the night passed on into the early hours of day, last call for beer and song requests were being done as Zack appeared through the front doors. Unlike most vampires that now lived in New York, he was not used to staying out in the day. Infact he still feared that by chance one day he would wake up away from home and see the blue sky above instead of the dark grey smog. He walked alone, having spent some time with the brunette already in the club's VIP room and he was not used to taking home guests.<br>
<br>
His steps directed him down a side street to where his car was parked and as he strode along, his eyes caught sight of someone hiding at the bottom of a dark set of stairs. Curious that a mortal would decide to sit here in such a vulnerable place with Vampires all over the area, he decided to investigate. &quot;Excuse me... miss?&quot; he crouched down not to far away, his eyes having an eerie glow in the semi darkness. &quot;You are foolish to be out here... vampires are leaving the bar and they will be wild and hungry... Hide here if you wish, I will leave you... but your fate will be sealed if you do...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/2/03 8:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> Her head jerked up as Jayden heard the words addressed to her, from above, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Excuse me... miss?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Her face blanched as blood drained from it when her eyes met the face of the Vampire she'd seen earlier, fighting in the street.<br>
<br>
Jayden heard him continue <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;You are foolish to be out here... vampires are leaving the bar and they will be wild and hungry... Hide here if you wish, I will leave you... but your fate will be sealed if you do...&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and wished she could just disappear into the concrete wall she now had her back pressed against. &quot;But..&quot; she started in a voice almost nonexistent from fear, &quot;..but isn't that what you are? Isn't my fate already sealed?&quot; <br>
<br>
As her hands began to shake, she gripped them tightly together. 'At least if he kills me, I won't have to worry about what I'll do tomorrow,' she thought bitterly, as she waited for him to make a move.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A> at: 9/2/03 8:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/2/03 8:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> Zack eyed the girl as she seemed to grow more frightened and he could only feel sorry for her because only he knew he was not going to kill her. &quot;Ma dame... should I have wanted to seal your fate I would have done so...&quot; he tried to keep his voice as soft and inviting as he could. &quot;Sure I am one of them, but like humans, vampires are different from eachother. Some are good, some are bad... and some you just do not know about...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And you will see tomorrow if you leave this place...

<br>
As he finished, he looked up as a group of vampires strode by, their voices loud in the night. They paid little attention to Zack in the darkness but the next group to pass by might not be so preoccupied. &quot;I won't harm you... unlike your human companion...&quot; his voice seemed to get a little angry as he saw the bruise upon her cheek. &quot;Take my hand, let us be gone from here to a more safer location with more humans if you prefer.&quot; he slowly moved his empty hand out to her to take. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/2/03 9:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> Jayden's eyes widened as the Vampire kneeling above her finished talking in her head.....and he'd even known what she'd been thinking.

<br>
Jayden blushed at the reminder of how she must look, when he mentioned the obvious bruise along her cheek as she looked up at the extended hand he offered her. Biting her lip in fear, she slowly reached out, and gripping his cool hand let him pull her up from the ground. &quot;Where are you taking me?&quot; she asked hesitantly, coming cautiously up the stairs. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A> at: 9/2/03 9:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/3/03 6:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> Zack smiled as he took her smooth hand in his, his grip was surprisingly gentle for someone with his build. &quot;Where will I take you?

On the hood was mounted a large Air Cam, the rims of the car sparkling chrome in the dim light. Zack smiled at the sight of his car for it was his baby, amoung other cars that he owned. He lead her around to the passanger side as he disarmed the car's alarm with a press of a remote, the beep beep ringing out in the night. <br>
<br>
Both his hands rested on her bare upper hips as he turned her slowly to face him, his eyes searching her face though there was no expression upon his own. &quot;I would like to meet the fool who feels he needs to strike you...

Jayden would have liked to look away but his eyes held her as much captive, as his hands did. What could she say. He was right, Tommy deserved whatever he got...maybe not from hitting her, but what he and her 'so called' friends had begun doing. Her thoughts were pulled back to the present as the Vampire spoke again, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;So where would you like me to take you?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Her lips trembled as she looked up at him, and with a slight shake of her head she answered, &quot;There is no place....you should have just left me. My family left when the problems first started....and there is no one I would call a friend....anymore.&quot; With the last words Jayden reached up and put her fingers over the bruise on her cheek. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/4/03 6:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> &quot;A world without hope... without coexistance means the end of existance...&quot; Zack spoke evenly, his hands still upon the bare skin of her waist. &quot;There was no way I could leave you at the vampire lair like that. Most of these vampires are young, wild and see only power for themselves... But only realised by a few... the older ones like me is that this world is about balance. Like you have good, evil... evil humans, good vampires.&quot; he paused to collect his thoughts.<br>
<br>
&quot;New York will soon become completely dead... Even for vampires for we require blood to live... Humans and vampires need to coexist which worked well when we were so secretive. But now, with our kind out in the open... its just a matter of time. These foolish young vampires will kill the very last source of their life before turning on eachother. I for one seek balance.&quot;<br>
<br>
He released her, his hand reaching for the door handle of his car, his body leaning closer to hers with his eyes ever so searching. &quot;I do not see the need for suffering to continue anymore. You do not have a home, friends or anyone to trust and that is not the way to live...&quot; Zack slowly opened his car door and helped her into the passanger seat before closing it behind her. Crossing in front of the car, he made his way inside through the driver's door, his hand putting the key in the ignition. &quot;If you like you may stay at my place. Its to big to live in alone now that I do not sleep so much in the day. No need to worry your self my beautiful. Your blood will not be spilled.&quot;<br>
<br>
The engine roared to life as he turned the key, the car vibrating with its strength as Zack pressed down the clutch and slipped the transmission into first gear. &quot;Oh by the way m'lady. My name is Zack.&quot; he flashed her a charming smile that could melt away any fear before he reached over and buckled her in. With the streets of New York so deserted now, anyone with a fast car could enjoy the freedom of no restrictions. The rear tires squealed as he released the clutch and pressed on the accellorator, the gravity pulling them both against the back of the seats as they took off into the night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/5/03 10:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> His words gave Jayden a glimmer of hope. Everything he was saying made sense to her. 'Why,' she wondered, 'couldn't the others see it...even her own kind didn't seem to grasp that if things continued this way there would be nothing left.'<br>
<br>
As his hands slid away from her, Jayden looked up into his intense eyes. His body was so close that she almost swayed into it as he spoke, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I do not see the need for suffering to continue anymore. You do not have a home, friends or anyone to trust and that is not the way to live...&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
After he helped her into the car and closed the door, her eyes followed as he moved around to the driver's side, and  remembering the feel of his hands on her skin she dropped her face to stare at the hands lying in her lap, her hair falling forward to hide the blush the crept across her cheeks. <br>
<br>
As she heard him get in and shut the door, she kept her head down as she listened to him offering her a place to stay. 'When had everything changed so much,' she thought, 'the people I thought were the good guys turn out to be evil and this Vampire, who I would have thought evil turns out to be good.' <br>
<br>
As the engine purred to life, Jayden looked up and over at him, catching the devastating smile he gave her, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Oh by the way m'lady. My name is Zack.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She watched as his hand moved over buckling her in. 'How could this man be so vicious one moment,' she questioned in her mind,  remembering the fight she'd seen earlier, 'but yet so gentle now?' &quot;Thank you .....Zack. For taking me in. I-I'm grateful for your kindness.&quot; Jayden turned looking out the window for a moment then turned back to Zack, &quot;My name's Jayden.&quot; <br>
<br>
The car jumped forward and began speeding down the street and Jayden's heart began to pound as the adrenalin rush surged through her. Even she couldn't deny the excitement of speeding through the large deserted city.<br>

The roar of the big block engine vibrated through the whole frame as they cruised through the deserted streets, rubble blowing in the breeze behind them. &quot;Jayden, now thats a different name, but lovely as its owner.&quot; he commented as they slowed down long enough to do a controlled skid around a corner.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope you like my home, I have tried to keep it fresh looking if you will. The whole city is a slum now but why should my home be right?&quot; he flashed her another smile. &quot;It used to take forever to get across town... guess this whole desertion thing has its upsides. Cops don't bother much anymore, its all martial law now, controlled by who ever the boss is of that area. My area is controlled by a rather tough vampire but his followers leave me pretty much alone. Trying to take me out just isn't good for their business.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zack slowed the car down as they approached a series of towering yet rundown looking apartments. Their former grace was but a shadow in the sinking moon of the night but to Zack it was home. His hand hit the button of the garage door opener as he cruised into the underground parking and a private door opened for him to drive through. The tires squealed as he brought the car along side of a beautiful 1969 Camero Z28 and came to a stop. &quot;My weekend baby.&quot; he commented as he climbed out of the car and made his way over to her side and helped her out.<br>
<br>
His hand was gentle as he took hers and it was hard to believe that very hand could be a stone cold death in a second should he wish. But he had no such plans for her for striking a woman was just not his style. Zack lead her towards the elevator and closed the steel door behind them before pressing the button to raise it up to his private suite. &quot;Powered sectors are prime locations to live these days... lucky me or we would be taking the stairs.&quot;<br>
<br>
The elevator stopped at the 23rd floor and Zack opened the doors and lead her out into his apartment. It was a stunning change from the rundown appearance of the outside for Zack lived in the lap of luxury. Beautiful plush furnature filled the rooms, the carpets soft under foot. Against the back wall of the livingroom was a huge aquarium with tropical fish with a bar table in front of it. Off to the one side could be seen the entrance to the kitchen and dinning room which also lead to the balconey which wrapped around the whole corner suite. Ancient paintings and weapons hung from the walls and there was even more to see that could not be seen from the entrance into the appartment. &quot;Welcome to my home, and make yourself at home.&quot; Zack smiled as he tossed his coat on the couch and made his way over to the bar for a drink. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/6/03 5:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> Jayden allowed Zack to lead her first into the elevator and then as they reached their destination out into his apartment. She was nervous of being in his domain and had remained mostly quiet the entire trip.<br>
<br>
As she stopped inside the door, Jayden's eyes widened in surprise and she remained speechless for a totally different reason. She had pictured the stereotypically dark and dreary movie set Vampire lair, but instead what greeted her eyes could have been a layout for one of those home and garden magazine's.<br>
<br>
She heard Zack say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Welcome to my home, and make yourself at home.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as she watched him throw his coat on the couch and move gracefully across the room. Finally she took a step, then another, looking around as she came fully into the room. &quot;This is very....beautiful,&quot; she said softly, hardly believing her eyes. <br>
<br>
Jayden stopped when she reached the couch that Zack's coat lay on, and slipped her own jacket off. Looking down at it for a moment she finally put it on the couch beside his. Then seeing the ring of bruises that circled her wrist, almost forgotten, Jayden put her hand behind her back hiding it away as she looked back up to see what Zack was doing.<br>

<br>
The sound of a cork popping off a bottle of wine sounded as Zack turned his attention away from Jayden. It was always his custom to have a glass of wine before turning in for the day but this morning he poured two glasses. Taking both in his hands, he made his way back to Jayden and handed her one with another of those smiles upon his lips. &quot;Wine from Paris... dated about the 1900s. A very interesting time... the world was different then. But here is to the hope of better things to come.&quot; he toasted her before sipping back the his wine.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know... it was more fun to be a vampire back then... The whole air of mystery you could have... and amaze people with some of the things you could do. Oh plus the excitement of hunting and yes... even hiding.&quot; he mussed as he picked up her coat and his and headed to the closet. &quot;I'll tell you one thing though. Being a vampire now is not nearly as fun. Everyone knows about you now and there is no fun when there is no secrets.&quot; his voice echoed from the hallway as he vanished around the corner to the closet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now if you even look remotely goth or pale, people will walk up to you and offer you blood and money to sire them like its the next big thing. What it ment to be a vampire is completely lost upon the youth...&quot; Zack reappeared into view with a large house coat in his hands and a towel. &quot;Its sad really.&quot; <br>
<br>
The vampire approached the girl once more and set the robe and the towel down on the couch were the coats had been. Once more his arms slipped around her waist as he pulled her close lightly. &quot;Those are for you when you have finished your wine... there is a bathroom down the hall you can take a shower or a bath. Which ever is your preference. Myself I am going to take a shower when your done and then I'm going off to bed. You may pull out the couch, its a bed or watch tv... Or what ever you prefer to do my lovely. But there is one thing you may not do and that is invite anyone into my home. You are the guest only... And do not even think about the one that bruised your face... your wrists... You are safe now for nothing will harm you here.&quot; he gazed into her eyes with the a deep look of honesty. Sure he was a vampire and a heartless one when it came to fights, but he could also be the most kindest of creatures when needed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/8/03 12:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> Jayden watched Zack from her position beside the couch, not sure what she should do now that she was in his home. She heard the pop of a cork and watched curiously as Zack filled two glasses and the strolled over, handing one to her.<br>
<br>
As she sipped the wine from her glass, Jayden listened to Zack reminisce about the past. He almost seemed sad for a moment as he talked of how it had been to be a Vampire then, compared to now. The sadness was something she could relate to....but it surprised her that a Vampire would want things to be the way they used to be, now that they ruled the city. <br>
<br>
Before she could ponder this revelation any further, he was moving in closer to her once again. Maybe it was the wine playing with her mind but something about the way he moved reminded her of a tiger...beautiful but deadly.<br>
<br>
Zack stopped in front of her, laying a robe and towel down on the couch and then pulled her close to him. Jayden listened, half distracted by his hands on her bare skin, as he explained the items he'd brought out for her, where she could sleep and finally his rule for not allowing anyone else into his home. <br>
<br>
A blush crept over her cheeks as he held her eyes for several moments. &quot;T-Thank you,&quot; she stammered out,&quot;But as I already told you there is no one.. I would invite in .....and you don't have to worry....I never want to see <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>him</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> again.&quot; <br>
<br>
When Zack finally released her, Jayden put her empty glass down, then scooped up the robe and towel and went to find the bathroom. Quickly undressing, her mind already on the pleasure of a hot shower, Jayden lay her folded garments on the counter. She would have preferred a long soak in the tub, but knowing Zack was waiting, decided it would be rude.<br>
<br>
Jayden sighed as the hot water slid over her bare skin. Things like this once taken for granted, were all the more pleasurable now that they were harder to come by. When she was done and dried off she picked up the robe and pulled it over her ivory skin, leaving the other clothes where they were.<br>
<br>
As she came back out into the living room, she looked around and not seeing Zack gave a little shrug. Thinking he must have already gone to his room, Jayden moved over to the couch and bent down to fix the bed. The robe, way too large for her smaller frame kept sliding down her shoulder and exposing quiet a bit of her pale breast, which would have embarrassed her had she not been alone. <br>
<br>
Finally with the bed out, she sat down on it and began to comb her fingers through her damp red hair. With each movement the robe inched down her shoulder once again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/8/03 9:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> Zack had made his way to the floor to roof window by the balconey when Jayden went into the shower. It was there that he stood silently overlooking the dimly light city of former freedom while his ears listened to the running water. His mind thought over various images of Jayden in all her female beauty but he was not about to impose upon her. To him Jayden seemed rather fragile and he was not about to make things worse for her no matter what his heart wanted. She was not like his other girl guests. They had been invited for the physical party but Jayden was here for her protection.<br>
<br>
So lost in thought was he that he hardly noticed her come out of the shower in the robe obviously to large for her. And he said nothing as he stood there in the darkness, his eyes watching her reflection in the window as she pulled out the bed. His eyes took in the exposure of herself as the robe keptr slipping down but not even a smile crossed his face. But now as she combed her long red hair with that robe innocently falling down further, he decided it was time to move. Very quietly he stepped out of the shadows and without even a look down at her lush breasts, Zack turned to face her.<br>
<br>
&quot;If there is anything else you need, well I will be in the shower, feel free to look for something to eat in the kitchen if your hungry.&quot; he smiled finally as he placed both hands on her bare shoulders before shifting the robe back into place upon them. &quot;And if you want, I still get tv channels from the ouside world if you care to watch something.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that he turned and headed into the shower as he removed his shirt while still in her view. The muscles of his back rippled as he tossed the shirt into his bedroom. Into the shower he went, leaving the door partly open though now out of sight he finished undressing. Soon the sound of running water drifted like the mist through the partly open door as Zack took a quick hot shower. Normally after seeing a sight like Jayden had innocently showed him would result in a cold shower but Zack did not mind feeling as he did right now.<br>
<br>
Now refreshed and damp, Zack wrapped a towel around his waist and not caring that he had a guest, he strode out of the bathroom and in plain view headed down the hall. Into his bedroom he went and dropped the towel for a full rear nude pose. His actions were not so innocent as Jayden's had been but he liked to entertain the girls he was around and right now he wanted to give Jayden something to think about. Just as it seemed he was about to turn around however, his arm closed the door and left the hall in darkness. Still naked, Zack climbed into bed and closed his eyes. Dawn was approaching and he needed sleep even if the sun actually never shown through the smog. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/9/03 12:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> An &quot;O&quot; of surprise escaped Jayden's mouth as Zack spoke from across the room and stepped out of the shadows. Looking up at him as he stopped in front of her, she heard him saying something about food and that he was going to take a shower. Then he reached down and pulled the robe up causing her to notice it had slipped down again. Her cheeks turned pink, and she dropped her eyes, until he started walking across the room then her eyes lifted watching as he took his shirt off. She watched the play of muscles under his pale skin until he dissapeard around the bathroom door.<br>
<br>
Jayden was a bit hungry but exaustion won out and she slipped down pulling the covers over her instead. Letting the sound of the running water lull her, Jayden began to close her eyes but when she heard Zack moving around she glanced over towards the hallway once again. Seeing him emerge, wearing only a towel her eyes followed as he moved into his bedroom. A small gasp escaped, as the towel fell to the floor. Jaydens face flamed as her eyes traced down his back, and then further still, until she'd seen every toned inch of his nude backside. Just as she thought he was going to turn, the door swung shut. She lay there staring at it for several seconds, almost in dissapointment.<br>
<br>
'When did it get so warm in here?' she thought sitting back up and fanning her cheeks with her hand. &quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; she told herself and lay back down, &quot;you've seen naked men before,&quot; but everytime she closed her eyes, that picture of him, framed in the doorway would burn itself across her mind.<br>
<br>
After some time, tossing and turning on the bed Jayden sat up. Deciding the robe was too large and uncomfortable to sleep in she slipped out of it, laying it within easy reach. Afterall everyone knew that Vampires slept all day long and she certainly would be awake before him. So it wouldn't matter if she didn't have anything on....she'd just make sure to get dressed before he got up. Slipping back down, she let the sheets cool her heated skin and eventually fell into a heavy sleep.<br>
<br>
The events of the last few days had taken their toll on the girl and she slept much harder and longer then she had thought she would. As late afternoon aproached, she still lay sleeping. Red hair spilled across the white pillowcase in sharp contrast, and fell down across the ivory skin of her bare back as she lay on her stomach. The sheet that had covered her, had slid down around her hips, accentuating the soft rounded curves of her bottom. One leg bent at the knee jutted out about mid thigh from the covering that gave her only a hint of modesty. And Jayden dead to the world could not know what an enticing picture she would make to anyone who happened to see her.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/9/03 6:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> Zack walked quietly from his bedroom and into the living room, dressed in nothing but black track pants with a white stripe up the legs. His vampire eyes picked out the breathtaking view of Jayden lying on her stomach upon the bed almost immediatly. Slowly he sucked in his breath as he stopped at the foot of the bed, his eyes traveling up her bare leg to just were the sheets covered her butt to hide the lovely womanhood below from sight. But his eyes did not stop there as the traveled up her slender bare back to her long red hair that spilled about her shoulders.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well are you not just the most beautiful sleeping beauty...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought to himself as he gazed upon her with a stir between his legs. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Some day perhaps... but not right now I will get to thrill you...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Silently he turned away and made his way into the kitchen so as not to disturb her. Obviously by her deep sleep, she needed it and Zack wanted her to feel refreshed for the night. He could not understand how someone could harm a girl so lovely and his fist clentched at the thought. He knew if he ever met the one that hurt her, that guy would be broken into pieces. Zack poured himself a drink of orange juice from the fridge and drank it slowly as he looked over at the couch. He wondered how she would adjust to his lifestyle and if she would accept him, maybe even stay a while because though he had just met her, he was already wondering how he could then live without her.<br>
<br>
Quietly he strode over to the corner of the livingroom were free weights, benchs and machines filled it. It was just out of sight of the couch and Zack turned on a dim light that would not wake her. Sitting down on the bench, he picked up a one hundred pound dumb bell in each hand and laid back. The weights moved up and down as he did a free weight bench press, the muscles of his arms rippling. Of course this was not heavy for him for many mortals could bench the same, this was just his warm up for the night. The two hundred pound weights still waited for him but the machines had even more. Being a vampire did have its advantages. It was there in the dawn of night before the glass window, Zack worked his muscles before his night life started up once more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaydenvaughn>Jayden Vaughn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/9/03 9:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/jayden.jpg width=139 height=166></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> With a contented sigh, Jayden opened her eyes. She couldn't remember waking up this relaxed in some time. She frowned as a soft clinking drew her attention, and it took her several seconds to focus on where the noise might be coming from. Rolling over and sitting up, Jayden's curiosity was piqued. <br>
<br>
Suddenly feeling a draft, she looked down to see herself exposed. 'Ah hell,' she thought, her face flaming as she quickly looked around. 'Calm down, Jay,' she told herself, 'at least he didn't see.'<br>
<br>
Looking around for the robe she'd discarded last night, Jayden finally spotted it at the foot of the bed. Glancing around again to make sure Zack wasn't in the room, she crawled towards it on her hands and knees. As she reached for the garment, there was that clinking again and Jayden looked over. She stopped, frozen, as she saw the man she'd been thinking about. Her breath coming out in a short gasp, Jayden's eyes travelled down his bare chest and back up to see him lifting a large weight, the dim light of the lamp gleeming off his glistening muscles.    <br>

Thinking that perhaps Jayden was waking up or maybe just moving, he looked her way for the foot of the bed was visible from where he lay. His eyes gleamed in the semi light as he looked into the darkened living room to see a sight that nearly stopped his vampire heart.<br>
<br>
There on her knees and completely nude was Jayden, her hands clutching the robe as her red hair framed her lovely face. The expression upon her fair features gave him a pretty good idea what she thought of him but the sight of her made him lose his consentation. The weight in his left hand fell free towards the floor as he dropped it but in powerful vampire speed he was able to catch it up quickly and regain some composure. He carefully set the weights down for safety sake, his eyes traveling all over her with visible delight though he remained where he was seated. It could be so easy for him to overpower her and take what his body desired but his mind would never allow him to do such an act.<br>
<br>
His attention diverted from her form to the rising thickness between his legs, a smirk crossing his lips playfully as he looked back up at her. &quot;My dear... have you never seem a vampire rising?&quot; he ment the pun as he joked over the fact that she was on her knees and naked before him. &quot;If I had a heart you might have been successful in giving me a heart attack with your beauty... as it is a cold shower might not even help me...&quot; he flashed her that charming smile as a ripple moved across his chest muscles. He certainly did not mind seeing her like this but he waited for her reaction now that she had seen him notice how exposed she was.<br>

But, it took her several seconds for his words to sink in. She looked down realizing she still wore nothing and quickly pulled the robe she'd been clutching in her hands, up, covering her body.<br>
<br>
&quot;I-I didn't mean to disturb you,&quot; she said in a voice huskier then usual, &quot;I'll let you....get back to your workout.&quot; Turning away, her back to the distracting sight of his half clothed body, Jayden closed her eyes trying to calm her racing heart. But when she did, images of his hands....his mouth...sliding across..., 'Whoa,' she thought, her eyes snapping open, 'that is not helping.' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/10/03 9:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/ZackM.jpg WIDTH=150 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Life To Live</span><hr size=1> Zack was a little disapointed when she turned her back and covered herself up while still sitting on the edge of his pull out bed. But her powerful emotions, her desires almost unchecked entered his mind, showing him she was not in any shape to resist. He had not intended to read her mind, but so strong was her thoughts that they found him anyway which left him sitting there torn between two directions.<br>
<br>
On the one hand he could tell her to find something to eat while he finished up his workout. Or on the other hand he could go over to her and fullfill her needs as well as his own. It was not a long battle in his mind as the body won over the mind and Zack got up and slowly made his way over to her. &quot;A vision of beauty such as you did not disturb me...&quot; his voice was deep and soft as he placed both of his hands gently on her shoulders. &quot;Besides after seeing you... I can not exactly return to that work out... way to many complications now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly his cool hands caused the robe to slip from her shoulders and fall open to her waist as he moved close behind her. His hands followed the robe down, passing softly over her breasts to rest upon her slender waist and once there he gently lifted her up so she was now up on her knees. That motion caused the robe to fall completely away as he turned her to face him, their lips almost level since she was kneeling up on the bed which he stood beside. Zack's dark eyes moved up her form from her womanhood to her eyes were they remained when he pulled her firmly against him. If she wanted to pull back, his grip was light enough to allow her that but he doubted she wanted to.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your innocent way... is the true beauty of all... I can not resist the desire in my heart for one taste... of your lips.&quot; he lowered his head slightly. &quot;I can not deny myself...&quot; his breath bathed her face before he planted a soft yet firm lasting kiss to her red lips. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showMessageRange?topicID=4.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showMessageRange?topicID=4.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showMessageRange?topicID=4.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showMessageRange?topicID=4.topic&start=81&stop=91>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showNextMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.emailToFriend?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.threadControl?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="kalaberiafrm36">Mortal and Kindred Laws<option value="kalaberiafrm37">Character Biographies<option value="kalaberiafrm38">Character Plotting<option value="kalaberiafrm45">Times Square<option value="kalaberiafrm40">Central Park<option value="kalaberiafrm41">Stanton Isle<option value="kalaberiafrm42">Abandoned Subway<option value="kalaberiafrm43">Chitter Chatter<option value="kalaberiafrm44">Advertisements <option value="kalaberiafrm46">Admin and mods<option value="kalaberiafrm47">Warehouse District</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia>MidnyghtRising</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm45>Times Square</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br> <a href=http://www.runesofdesire.com><img src=http://runesofdesire.com/rod6.jpg></a><br><br>
