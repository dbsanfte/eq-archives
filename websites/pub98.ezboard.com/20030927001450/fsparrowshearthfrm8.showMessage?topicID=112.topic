He adds a perspective to the issue that didn't initially come to my mind.  It's an interesting read.  Yes, the columnist is a Christian.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The good bishop walked out on his wife</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
 There are some clever parodies of the old Simon and Garfunkel hit, Mrs. Robinson, making the rounds on the Internet this week, all of them commenting on the election of New Hampshire Episcopalian Rev. Gene Robinson as the first openly gay bishop in the history of the American Anglican Church. Gregory Popcak's amended lyrics were particularly punchy: <br>
<br>
&quot;Slouching toward Gomorrah on a Sunday afternoon/ Shrugging off conservative debate/ Laugh about it, shout about it, when you've got to choose/ Either way the Gospel has to lose/ Where have you gone, C.S. Lewis? Anglicans look wistfully to you (woo woo woo)/ What's that you say, Bishop Robinson? Lewis wouldn't know his church today? (hey hey hey).&quot; <br>
<br>
Putting aside the painful struggle going on in so many churches about how or if active homosexual behaviour can be squared with Christian gospel and tradition, I'd like instead to address a supplementary issue raised by Robinson's election. Trojan horse-style, all the clamour about the &quot;openly gay bishop&quot; has distracted us, allowing this other matter to enter through the castle gate unchallenged. <br>
<br>
I allude to Bishop Robinson's abandonment of his wife and two young daughters 15 years ago, as he moved out of the family home to sort out his sexual orientation, and then moved in with his current lover the next year. In a word, I allude to the matter of divorce. <br>
<br>
Granted, divorce doesn't strike the modern ear with quite the shock it once did. Over the last 30 or so years, secular society has greatly relaxed its disapproval. With 40 to 50 per cent of marriages now confidently expected to fail, we had to lighten up on this score or else we'd be shaking our heads and 'tsk-tsk-tsking at every other person we met -- which is nobody's idea of a fun or a productive way to go through life. <br>
<br>
But instigating a divorce or being unfaithful to your partner used to be suicide for anybody with a public profile. If a disenchanted spouse of a mayor or MP wanted to see their way of life maintained, they had to put on a brave public face and pretend everything was hunky-dory for the duration of hubby's term in office. In England, Lord Melbourne's political career only survived the collapse of his marriage because it was so widely known that his wife had run off with that poetic rotter, Lord Byron. <br>
<br>
Nowadays, it makes little difference who has behaved beastly to whom. In the wake of the Bill Clinton presidency in the States, the behavioural bar has been set so low (for Democrats, at least) that it's impossible to imagine any sort of infidelity that would be deemed unacceptable by the electorate. <br>
<br>
Once upon a time, disapproval of divorce could even be extended to the rule-free zone of Hollywood. Even movie stars had to be careful when and how they reneged on their vows -- witness the public banishment of Ingrid Bergman, who'd been cast as a nun and then Joan of Arc just before shucking her family to run off with Italian film director Roberto Rossellini. <br>
<br>
Free passes to walk out on marriage have now been distributed to pretty well every sector of society, but some of us thought censure might still be applied when it came to ministers of the cloth. After all, these people are supposed to be Christ's shepherds, entrusted to lead the laity in the Christian walk of life. While Christ is not recorded saying anything about homosexuality, He certainly did have a thing or two to say about the indissolubility of marriage. <br>
<br>
I would've thought any Christian church would think twice before electing a leader who'd walked out on his family. But, incredibly, that matter never seemed to come up.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Exactly right.  And, with the church continually watering down the Gospel of Christ, I fear that the general response in the NEXT 30 to 40 years will meet homosexual ministers with the same regard.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     This change in doctrine and continually shifting feet in the sand is one of my greatest problems with protestant denominations.  <br>

And, isn't it sad and shocking at times when you see our youth of the world glorifying movie-stars?   It gives me a glimspe of how some must have felt upon witnessing the masses of people cheering at the brutal deaths of gladiators. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeffthefinn>jeffthefinn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://webpages.charter.net/nilus/finnbutton.GIF" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your Friendly<br>Orthodox Resource</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#B87333>(8/12/03 2:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=112.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/nilus/jfinn.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Bishop Robinson</span><hr size=1> In the pre-60's Anglican Church a divorce could get one defrocked.  If you want a watershed event in the Episcopal Church that opened the doors to what is going on now and has for the last 35 years, is the case of Bishop James Pike.  There was a hersey trial with no solution, a censure and that was all.  William Stringfellow who represented Pike at the heresy trial said there was no standards left in the Anglican Communion.  The church has dropped a million members in the last 30 years.<br>
