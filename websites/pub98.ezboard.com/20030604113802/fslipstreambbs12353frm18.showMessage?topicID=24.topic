But, as likely as I am to get flamed for this, I just had to say this one thing, with some examples as to why:<br>
<br>
Fuck Roddenberry.<br>
<br>
Okay, that was a great weight taken from my back. <br>
<br>
The reason that I say that is that a lot of people seem to feel the need to &quot;bear up the cross&quot;, such as it is of Gene Roddenberry.<br>
<br>
Not that I hate the man or anything, it's just that when I read posts regarding the &quot;genite's review&quot;, not that i have anything against any genites, but I do have one thing that I have a problem with in regards to &quot;Roddenberry's&quot; sci-fi on a number of occasion.  That thing being &quot;intelligent Sci-fi&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now, let me make one thing clear.  I am a bit of a trekkie.  However, I don't know all the names of all the episodes nor have I liked every single thing that has come out of the whole Star Trek team.  For example, I think that Roddenberry's death was a good thing for Star Trek: the Next Generation.  Mostly, because if you look from season one, where if I remember correctly Roddenberry was still alive at least for some of it, and you look at the fifth season, where I'm of fair certainty that he was long dead, you'll see two entirely differnent shows being done.  And I'd like to say, as I'm sure many people have said, Voyager sucks.<br>
<br>
Roddenberry = Intelligent Sci-fi?<br>
<br>
Okay, here's where I have a problem with genites.  (Not that I hate them, rather find a flaw in their Imperious leader, that being Gene Roddenberry.)  The thing is, if you are going to praise Mr. Roddenberry, then you must be talking more or less about the Original Star Trek.  Which to some people is the &quot;only Trek&quot;... Right...  I'm just curious as to how much, or rather how little, the Great Mr. Roddenberry really had to do with the later shows, the Next Generation and Deep Space Nine to be exact.<br>
<br>
Intelligent Sci-fi?   How in the world can anyone call the Original Star Trek intelligent or sci-fi for that matter, is truly beyond me.  How dare I?  Well, let's try:<br>
<br>
&quot;400 Quatloos on the human.&quot; -glowing brain in glass case.  Kirk in a gladitorial arena with assorted aliens.<br>
<br>
The whole &quot;Gangster&quot; world episode.  Yes, there is a small amount of sci-fi involved here, but then where does it go?<br>
<br>
The planet where Kirk and Spock fight alongside Lincoln and some great Vulcan thinker against Genghis Khan(I think), Kahless(minus wrinkly forehead) and two other &quot;evil people.&quot;<br>
<br>
A man in a one-horned White Ape suit.  Come on, a guy in a white ape suit?  Well, that's not alien enough, add a horn....<br>
<br>
Trelane.  A Q-like entity.  Near omnipotent entities?  I don't believe they exist.  And don't even get me started on omnipotent ones.<br>
<br>
Anyone else want to add examples of not-so &quot;intelligent sci-fi&quot;?   <br>
<br>
I'd like to add that I've enjoyed a number of the previous episodes that I've mentioned.  But, how, in light of evidence, can somebody call themselves a &quot;genite&quot; and then claim that Mr. Roddenberry as a creator of &quot;intelligent sci-fi&quot;.<br>
<br>
Let the flames begin.<br>

<br>
On with the rant:<br>
<br>
Apollo.  Okay, you're saying that that the Greek gods were real?  Right, not that they were constructs to prove the reason why things happen.  Wouldn't this be the converse of science, and perhaps the lack of intelligence?  Yeah, I know &quot;Apollo&quot; used technology to simulate god-like powers.  I'd like to see something intelligent or sci-fi to come out of this episode.  <br>
<br>
Jack the Ripper is an alien?  Oh, that's a good example of sci-fi and intelligent at that....  Right....<br>
<br>
O-K Corral world, wherein our intrepid heroes are the Cowboys facing off against Wyatt Earp, his brothers and Doc Holliday.  I like Wyatt Earp movies, but where is the sci-fi in this?<br>
<br>
The Roman world, not the one where the crew was influenced by a former Federation guy, but the one where the inhabitants are all psychic, dancing midget and Kirk and Uhura have the first televised inter-racial &quot;kiss.&quot;  Important?  Laughable is more like it.  <br>
<br>
What about the one where Kirk fights the lizard-man?<br>
<br>
I know that there is more, but I couldn't possibly name them all.  So, join in if you'd like.<br>

<br>
I am gonna have to agree with alot of this.<br>
<br>
I never did care for the original Star Trek.<br>
<br>
My favorite was TNG, followed by DS9.<br>
<br>
Star Trek was just cheesy and bad...  It was cancelled in a time when people would watch pretty much any crap that you put in front of them.  That should tell you something.  You know, just because you're young and you watch something on TV, it doesn't mean you absolutely HAVE to worship the crap when you get older.  You're looking at it through a haze of nostalgia and mixing it in with your lost youth people!!!<br>
<br>
I used to watch ~shudder~ &quot;The Dukes of hazard&quot; when I was a little kid.  I am still strangely attracted to this horrible, horrible show so I know what I'm talking about.  Intellectually I know it's repetitive crap that only a complete moron would enjoy watching.... Yet if I see it being re-run somewhere, I watch it.  It makes me feel good.  It's just nostalgia...<br>
<br>
I hated the ongoing theme that seemed to run through quite a few Trek episodes...<br>
<br>
Somehow happiness equates with BAD.   When the spores in that one episode infected Kirk's crew and everyone was HAPPY, including Spock Kirk was willing to do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to bring that crashing down. As they said in the movie &quot;Free Enterprise&quot; Kirk could have left Spock alone to fuck and live happily for the rest of his life.  He just couldn't do that.<br>
<br>
Another prime example is whith the planet that was practically a Utopia.  The people were primitive and they worshipped a computer like a god...  So what?  They didn't know hunger, anger or murder until Kirk came along to upset their lives.  Kirk made the decision to wreck all that by destroying the computer.  Then he left the people to sort him turning their world upside down all by themselves.  What an ass!!!<br>
<br>
What kind of Roddenberrian message is that?<br>

What's not to like? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's every dictator's dream, to not only control their subject's minds, but to make them happy so as they won't even think of resisting.<br>
<br>
What difference does it make if someone is happy or not if they have no will of their own? A person without free will isn't really even a person anymore. <br>
<br>
I'd rather be miserable as hell and have my own free will than be a happy automaton. That's beyond slavery of the worst sort. <br>
<br>
I don't see how it makes a difference in controlling people's minds whether you make them happy or not - you're still controlling their minds so they have no choice as to how they feel. <br>
<br>
Happiness without free will is meaningless. At best you would call it a facade.<br>

All of us remember the premise of the episodes being talked about here.  (and when were they on TV??) Whether it is better to live in a paradise and never know want (Eden) or fall from grace and know the pain of living.. (RL)?? <br>
<br>
I don't know if there is an answer, but it is liberating to return to the discussion time and time again....... Each side of the argument (if that is indeed what it is) makes its case...... and each side fails.  <br>
<br>
Truth be told we as human yearn for that peace and joy that is called heaven, yet require the struggle and pain of life in order to experience the joy and ourselves.  Life is sometimes nothing more than a series of contrasts.<br>

As campy as it gets at times, it is a fun show.  <br>
<br>
I was kind of complaining about the whole &quot;intelligent Sci-fi&quot; category of the Gene-ites.  Now as much as I totally understand the problems that they have had with the show's more recent episodes.  I can't personally agree with them, but I do see where their opinions stem from though.  <br>
<br>
I don't want to really upset any of the Gene-ites or anything with my little rant, so I put it here in the Abyss section.  It seems to me that they when they complain about Andromeda not being &quot;intelligent sci-fi&quot;, they seem to overlook the goofier aspects that made up the more Gene Roddenberry helmed original Star Trek.  I'm not saying that the original Star Trek didn't cover the more meaty social commentary, they absolutely did.  <br>
<br>
But, the original Star Trek, in my opinion, is a mixture of both camp and intelligence.  <br>
<br>
While the newer episodes of Andromeda seem to be getting back to that.  A lot of the Gene-ites' reviews  seem to only see and judge by the first two new shows, later seasons of TNG and all DS9 standards, more or less the &quot;New Testament&quot; Star Trek shows (after Gene Roddenberry).  As opposed to the &quot;Old Testament&quot; that is the original Star Trek and early seasons of TNG (Gene Roddenberry).  <br>
<br>
Such that, if they are going to be calling themselves Gene-ites, then shouldn't they consider all episodes of Andromeda by the standards of &quot;Old Testament Star Trek&quot; rather than that of &quot;New Testament Star Trek&quot;?<br>

<br>
Regarding the spores and the computer ruling the primitives like a god:<br>
<br>
But, Spock isn't himself.  To one's own self be true.  Just because they were made to be happy, does not truly make them free.  It may seem like a utopia.  But, don't you think that if a substance ALTERS YOUR MIND from your typical personality, that this might be a problem.  <br>
<br>
Spock was content when he was a logical being.  While he may have seemed content while being in his ALTERED STATE, he was not truly the him that he had chosen to be.  Because as a sentient being, Spock chose to be logical, that is his choice.  While the spores changed his core personality.  We've seen Spock appear happy a few times within the original Star Trek, but he would ultimately always choose his logical personality.<br>
<br>
The spores and the computer, in my opinion, are a lot like elementary school teachers(computer) that give the hyper-active kids(primitives) in their classes Ritalin(spores).  The child was happy to choose his own way to live, he may be a nuisance at times, but that is his choice.  At a young age, a little energy never hurt anyone.  I was a hyperactive child, but I grew out of that.  These children(primitives) aren't even given the choice as to whether they want to be happy or sad.  <br>
<br>
They(primitives) are instead force-fed the propaganda(spores) of the machine to be happy.  No choice, no freedom.  The primitives were not given the choice of &quot;Would you like spores?&quot;  Spock was given spores without his own consent.  Instead, this culture decided what was right for him and he gave up control to that machine.  <br>
<br>
New thought!!<br>
<br>
Is the episode in question a commentary on cults and communes?   What about all the people that have been brain-washed after joining a cult.  Wasn't this a social problem that was happening around the time that this particular episode was being aired? <br>
<br>
Disclaimer:  I am not familiar with cults, nor am I very familiar with mental illness and the medicines that have been used in treatment or mental illness.<br>

The spores episode he can almost be forgiven because his crew are changed, for the better, for the much happier in all counts, but they are changed.  Kirk did it for selfish reasons to be sure.  He needed a crew.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The computer episode the primitive natives worshipped a computer like a god and they were simple and they were happy.<br>
<br>
Kirk stepped in and destroyed their god.<br>
<br>
Then he left them to fend for themselves.<br>
<br>
He is such an ass. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
I stand by my previous statement, as addled as it may be.  Let me deconstruct my deconstruction, so as to show my intention.<br>
<br>
In the case of the spores, Kirk is right.  The man that shags with shag on his head is responsible for his crew.  Though they are happier because of the spores, are they truly happy?  The spores are causing the crew to be happy.  They are not being happy by choice, they are happy because the spores are making them as such.  If they did not have the spores on board, would the crew have been as giddy as they were while under the influence.  I think the elementary school teacher analogy might still work.  Just minus, the idea that the teacher is the computer. <br>
<br>
In the case of the Primitives' Computer God:  This is a sticky wicket.  On the one hand, computer provided for the primitives didn't it?  On the other, it is not presenting itself as it truly is. Why won't these primitives believe in a god that is a Machine?  Will the primitive culture bow down before a gray monolith of blinking lights and spinning reel to reel tapes?  We'll never know.  In this case, Kirk should have given the primitives the option of bowing down before the silicon and vacuum tube god.  Here I concur, Kirk is an ass.  <br>

Apparently in TOS the Prime Directive, which prohibits such interference, isn't quite so prime. The storyline of Kirk bringing down some fake god worshipped by a primitive society is a very common one and suggests to me that Kirk himself has a god complex. No-one dares question the fake god until he comes along: he is the only one who can destroy the fake god......or at least he believes he is. More importantly he behaves as though he is the only one who has the right. Ironically this attitude ultimately makes him every bit  as bad as the &quot;god&quot; he is destroying. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=unasaluslillius>Una Salus Lillius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#0000ff, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/7/03 3:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: A flame about this high...</span><hr size=1> I've been waiting all afternoon to get in here and respond.<br>

With all due respect?  Um....erm...I DISAGREE with you.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Okay, first of all &quot;my&quot; perception of TOS is *strongly* colored by the novelizations thereof and the novels between the series and the first motion picture.<br>
<br>
Certainly a SUPERFICIAL comparison of say IHNAT to TOS would have some people saying something like &quot;what's wrong with Dylan acting like a sexist neandrathal asshole, I mean look at Kirk in Gamesters of Triskelion&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
But you know what?  Gamesters of Triskelion was made in the freaking SIXTIES.  You can't view TOS in a vaccuum.  So what if sexist stereotyping was still very much a part of ALL television back then.  That doesn't make it part of Gene's vision.  <br>
<br>
Even in eps like Triskelion Gene had something to say (like messages about enforced labor, freedom to choose, sportsmanship), whereas bullshit like IHNAT has NOTHING to say other than that big bad Dylan is perfectly willing to usurp missions from his first officer and then turn it around and make it HER problem.  <br>
<br>
Yeah Gene ites are just as capable as anyone else of ivory towering it but you know what?  The point is that we think that Gene's vision from DAY one is sadly missing in Andromeda these days.<br>
<br>
And we're gonna keep saying so.  <br>
<br>
BTW, you and anyone else is more than welcome to join.  Variety of opinion (especially dissenting opionion) is imho a cornerstone of classic Gene.  So Sir Pill come on down.  Be the Spock to my Bones.  And next time, don't feel the need to put an interesting thread like this in a place like the Abyss.<br>
<br>
I think it's very worthy of discussion and I wish that all Geneites would do so but most of them are unlikely to even THINK to look here for such a discussion.<br>

I am inclined to agree.<br>
<br>
If were are to judge Roddenberry-style shows as the best, then only the first season and a half of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Star Trek the Next Generation</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> could be considered.<br>
<br>
Those are the episodes that Gene Roddenberry had a direct hand in. As soon as he relaxed his oversight on that show, we hit the storylines that made the series take off, like the introduction of the Borg. <br>
<br>
To skip way ahead, when I saw the movie <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>First Contact,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I believed the theme of that movie would have had Gene Roddenberry turning over in his grave (wherever that is in space). Picard turns into Rambo, fighting Aliens? But it was a damn good movie, and in the top rankings of many fans.<br>
<br>
To me, for an episode to be like Gene Roddenberry, it would have to be one of those crappy episodes with Tasha Yar and Troi walking around imploring, &quot;I sense something&quot;. <br>
<br>
What I do look for is character development, internal continuity between episodes, interesting plots, and to be entertained. A tall order, but shows like Farscape and Firefly prove it's not impossible.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, those shows also just got cancelled, so now I don't know what to think. Mediocrity survives, excellence is punished. They can have a zillion critters die from explosive sparks on Andromeda, and this show goes on, while real interesting scifi is thrown off TV. There's no justice.<br>
<br>
I just watched this week's Enterprise, and aside from a touching tribute to the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Columbia</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> crew at the start, the episode was heavy-handed, preachy, wishy-washy and insulting. That's the Gene Roddenberry I know, if Gene-ites like that sort of thing, they should love this season of Enterprise. But it's not intelligent scifi, and it doesn't advance the human potential. Kind of like this season of Andromeda.<br>

This is an unexpected surprise.  I leave the board for a couple of days and my thread has delusions of competent discussion...<br>
<br>
Let me begin with apologies extended toward any Gene-ites who may have been offended by my statements.  Also, apologies for calling Gene-ites: genites.<br>
<br>
I had originally intended this for The Abyss, more than anything else, because it was intended as a personal venting thread.  <br>
<br>
Also, I didn't really want to put a mini-rant in the middle of somebody else's well thought-out review, because I hate it when a good thread gets derailed because some imbecile (aside: am I talking about me?) wanted to say their part, but more in a manner where it wasn't intended as a discussion.  But rather as a general thumbing of the nose at anyone in particular and was never intended as such.  <br>
<br>
Not that I didn't want any discussion to be started as a result of this thread, quite the opposite, I was more curious as to other people's thoughts regarding &quot;Gene Roddenberry&quot; and what was said and what was shown.  And yes, some small amount of bile was to be expected,  as some of the original Star Trek are going to be seen as somewhat ridiculous, as well as some of Star Trek: the Next Generation (mostly the aforementioned first season).  <br>
<br>
First off...<br>
<br>
How do the novels of Star Trek really apply to the show itself?  Sure, I've enjoyed the two or three that I've read, but while they are representative of the show, do they really apply in the scope in that Gene Roddenberry himself stepped up and had a hand in it in a direct sense.  <br>
<br>
Such that, was it directly under his purview, like the original Star Trek and some of Star Trek: the Next Generation was?  Because, while someone can be inspired by another's concept, to me, the proof is in the pudding.  <br>
<br>
That being said, HERE IS A CHALLENGE:<br>
<br>
Could some Gene-ites please step forward and defend each instance that I have mentioned as &quot;intelligent sci-fi&quot;?<br>
<br>
I would like to see a Gene-ites' perspective on each of the episodes that I, or anyone else for that matter, in this thread have mentioned.<br>
<br>
Gamemasters of Triskelion(?) excluded as Una Salus Lillius has already mentioned it, or if you'd like please elaborate on it.  I'm curious of the Gene-ite's perspective.<br>
<br>
Could you please make it identifiable other than the title of the particular episode though, for I don't really know which ones are which.  I know specific things that happen in episodes, but have a hard time remembering specific titles. <br>
<br>
-the former Pill<br>
<br>
And as to not seem overly biased in my opinion against the original Star Trek, I would also like to add this Next Generation episode: <br>
<br>
The one in which, Tasha Yar had to fight the African American woman on the planet ruled by the African American woman's husband.  I believe that her husband wore a dashiki and was also an African American.  A friend of mine actually called this the Africa planet episode.  I remember scratching my head about how this episode was intelligent or sci-fi.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theformerpill>theformerPill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thread killer and official scapegoat</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/9/03 10:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  ...</span><hr size=1> To Una Salus Lillius:<br>
<br>
Be the Spock to your Bones?  An interesting proposition, though I do not see myself as up to the task.  I've been more or less in agreement with you regarding most of your reviews, and am silent when my view is supported either way.  I only feel the need to say something when my opinion is not expressed.  Pathological Lurker Syndrome.  <br>
<br>
Regarding the rest:<br>
<br>
I will not defend Kirk, nor will I defend Dylan.  I will only trust Shatner to be Shatner and Sorbo to be Sorbo.  <br>
<br>
That being said, I don't think that I view the original Star Trek in a vacuum.  I realize that the Gene-ite's don't either.  However, if you are going to take a man's name and make it a &quot;standard&quot;, it's difficult for me to not to look at his work and use that as the standard, as opposed to simply what he said.  <br>
<br>
off the cuff example:<br>
Modern Christians should be more open-minded.  Christ, himself, accepted all that accepted him.  But, every time that I see a Christian in the media today, it seems as if it is a very narrow view of Christianity.  One that does not seem accepting of other opinions other than that of the speaker.  Christ lived his life according to what he said.<br>
------------------------<br>
<br>
It's easy to point in a direction and name a movement after the person that pointed, but what of the people that actually did the work and the work itself?  <br>
<br>
Gene Roddenberry was a such a man.  There is no denying the fact that his work has done much for all of the science fiction that we see on television today.  <br>
<br>
But, what I want to know is, do the actual works of Roddenberry correspond with the stringent code which the Gene-ites have undertaken?  <br>

<br>
Yes I accept the challenge.  But you're gonna have to give me some time. <br>
<br>
But first some more back ground. <br>
<br>
For me, for YEARS the only Trek WAS the novels.  I was one of those who grew up on TOS.  Three frail seasons of Television from a man who actually envisioned a future in which the human race &quot;makes it&quot;.<br>
<br>
For me TOS and movies 2 and 6 are the only REAL Trek.  I NEVER loved the characters in TNG.  Oh they had some good eps, especially in the 3rd season but honestly that crew never caught me the way Kirk,Spock and McCoy did, so I'm not going to be able to talk TNG really.<br>
<br>
As for the rest, I was bored with DS9 and didn't watch Voyager or Enterprise (but hey, it's not like Gene was overly involved in these anyways so...)<br>
<br>
So you need to understand that &quot;this&quot; Gene-ite's perspective is drawn almost EXCLUSIVELY from TOS, the novelizations thereof, the rich development of those characters and that universe that took place in the novels before the Motion Picture, movies 2 and 6, and also First Contact (which I liked because of Zephrym Cochran and because again, it envisioned a future in which man makes it).<br>
<br>
So by and by I'll respond as to each of the eps you mentioned (some of which I liked more than others and some of which would get higher scores in a gene ite review than others would).<br>

I'm of the opinion that if you take the best, you must also take the worst.<br>

<br>
So I don't get your point.  I watched TNG but most of it made so little impression on me that I doubt I could even quote you episode names.  And he wasn't even involved in most of TNG even.<br>
<br>
In other words, no, you've got it wrong.<br>
