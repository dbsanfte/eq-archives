A Plan for Counteracting Activist Judges <br>
Jerry Falwell<br>
Friday, Jan. 23, 2004 <br>
On Tuesday night, as I sat in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol during President Bush’s speech, I was so proud of our president as he stood firm on many issues confronting the American family. He defended the sanctity of traditional marriage, pressed for young workers having the opportunity to save part of their Social Security taxes in personal retirement accounts, and urged that faith-based organizations be treated equally by the government in terms of social service grants and contracts.<br>
<br>
I was so pleased to also hear the president challenge our nation’s “activist judges,” who have attempted to redefine marriage by court order, “without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives.”<br>
<br>
It was at that moment that I realized the importance of Liberty University’s decision to launch a Christian law school.<br>
<br>
With our nation’s landscape reportedly populated with more law school graduates than at any time in history, it would seem appropriate to ask, “Is there really a need for another law school?”<br>
<br>
My answer is a vigorous yes.<br>
<br>
In fact, it may be more critical now than ever.<br>
<br>
Consider President Bush’s admonition to the scores of activist judges who habitually manipulate the law to reflect current (and ever-changing) social trends or to meet the demands of leftist political groups. <br>
<br>
Creating a “right to privacy” in order to safeguard abortion is the most notorious of these rulings. And last year’s 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision to outlaw the phrase “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance is also an insulting decision that contradicts our Founders’ frequent and unabashed pursuit of heavenly blessing amid the founding of our nation.<br>
<br>
As excited as I am about the new Liberty University School of Law, many others around the nation are equally excited.<br>
<br>
Mathew Staver, founder and general counsel of the Orlando, Fla.-based Liberty Counsel — an organization that is at the forefront of the religious freedom battlefield — is serving as chairman of the steering committee of the law school.<br>
<br>
Mr. Staver said that while the Liberty University School of Law will be the birthplace of premier attorneys who will defend religious liberty and Christian values, there is another key expectation for our students: “They will become leaders — not followers — in all areas of the legal profession, politics, government, the corporate world, religious and pastoral ministry and indeed every profession.” <br>
<br>
Later this year, Liberty Counsel will expand by opening an office in Lynchburg, Va., at the new law school, while maintaining its headquarters in Orlando. Liberty University will also partner with Liberty Counsel to open the Center for Constitutional Litigation and Policy, an organization that will aggressively defend religious liberties in our nation.<br>
<br>
In addition, Dean Bernard Dobranski — who has served as a law professor at Notre Dame, dean of Detroit School of Law, dean of Catholic University School of Law and who currently serves as dean of Ave Maria School of Law — has agreed to serve as our law school’s American Bar Association consultant.<br>
<br>
Ave Maria, a newly accredited law school, graduated its first class in 2003. The school pulled off what seemed virtually impossible by having a 93 percent bar passage rate for its initial class, beating out every other school in Michigan, including the University of Michigan. <br>
<br>
We are so pleased that Dean Dobranski has agreed to serve as a consultant as Liberty attempts to match Ave Maria’s success rate.<br>
<br>
Personally, I see the Liberty University School of Law as the greatest resource for future battles against the American Civil Liberties Union and other institutions that consistently attempt to completely secularize our nation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Special Announcement<br>
Most importantly, the Liberty University School of Law — thanks to the support of individuals who want to fund this legal endeavor — announced this week that full tuition scholarships are available for up to 50 academically qualified applicants. (In addition, partial scholarships are available for those who do not qualify for full scholarships.)<br>
<br>
The Liberty University School of Law is set to open in August 2004. I encourage all readers who have ever considered entering the field of law to apply for the entering class. <br>

Eventually, this would also help reverse the stupid law that is Roe v Wade, and save millions of innocent lives!<br>
<br>
There is however another effective way to stem the tide of Judges trying to steer the direction of our Laws. BUMPER STICKERS! Yep, good old fashioned Bumper Stickers with National distribution with a very simple message on each and every one of them &quot;Judges are Impeachable&quot;. <br>
<br>
All we need now is someone with very deep pockets to help pay for all the Bumper Stickers!<br>
