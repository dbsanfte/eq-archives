&quot;Just thought you'd love to know that you're so, I guess the word is popular.&quot; She made a face, knowing he wasn't popular...just well known. <br>
<br>
Seth looked to her. &quot;Popular? Heh, whatever, I don't like people around here, they don't like me.&quot; He paused, and then smirked. &quot;I think the word you're looking for is infamous. <br>
<br>
Serina grinned back to him, finally, a conversation. &quot;I wouldn't say they don't like you. You could definitely have your way with any girl at this school.&quot; She smiled, then thought, looking to Samantha in the front row talking to Ikari. &quot;Well, almost.&quot; <br>
<br>
Seth sighed. &quot;Why, would I want to have anything to do with girls at this school?&quot; <br>
<br>
Serina rolled her eyes, she wished he would stop pretending like looks didn't matter to him. &quot;Come ON! This school has the hottest, most powerful girls...and guys, in the country!&quot; <br>
<br>
Seth smirked. &quot;Do you really think I care about the girls here? They're basically vapid, shallow little preps, who have the slightest amount of power and think they can reign over the school. I'm sorry, but I'd rather not be associated with anybody at this school,  save a few.&quot; He looked back to Serina. Hadn't this girl gotten the message when he denied her phone number yesterday?<br>
<br>
Serina knew he was implying that she was like that, but she knew she wasn't, even though she didn't know anything about her powers, let alone how to use them. &quot;Okay...if you insist. However, I know you must think some girls here are at least hot, there really isn't an ugly girl at this school.&quot; She replied. <br>
<br>
Seth closed his eyes at the thought, and grinned. She definitely wasn't wrong about that. &quot;You're right, but a pretty girl, and a girl I would want to go out with are two completely different matters entirely.&quot;<br>
<br>
Serina grinned again. &quot;Hm, going out, such an immature term, I wouldn't think you would really stoop that low. Maybe, you aren't as superior as I had originally thought.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seth chuckled. &quot;Actually, I was just making sure you understood me by using something, a little closer to your vocabulary level, my apologies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My vocabulary?&quot; She said, a tinge of anger breaking into her voice. &quot;You., don't even know me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Seth noted her change in emotion, and wanted to see how far he could take it. &quot;Temper temper Serina...and I said your vocabulary, because I may not know you personally, but I do know that there are plenty of girls who act, talk, and probably think, the same exact way you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
She slammed her pencil down. &quot;NO you don't! You have no idea. Maybe you should stop thinking that just because I dress like them, that I actually am them. It just might surprise you to know how different some people ARE!&quot; She pushed her hair back behind her ears forcefully, and glared at him, anger gleaming in her eyes. Why did he think he was so much better than everyone, what the hell had people done to him?<br>
<br>
&quot;And, it might surprise you Serina, how almost all people act exactly the same.&quot; He countered softly, this discussion had become extremely amusing.<br>
<br>
Serina turned quickly, scanning the room, and pointed to Heaton. &quot;Him, I bet he doesn't act a thing like her.&quot; She moved her finger over to motion to Shyama.<br>
<br>
Seth smiled. <br>
&quot;Heaton...he was not made the same as everybody else was, he..feels a bit estranged from the world, as does Shyama. Both of them have been through their own personal hell. Both have never truly loved. And both, Serina, are truly happy where they are today.&quot; He said smoothly, the words cascading like water off the tongue. He looked back to Serina.<br>
<br>
She sighed.<br>
&quot;Okay...so you're right, everyone is basically the same, but everyone is basically different too.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seth smiled. &quot;And their struggle for individuality binds them all together in the end.&quot; Seth replied. He packed his stuff up, and turned back to Serina, ready to reply to anything she said next.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you expect yourself to be excluded from this!&quot; She questioned, not believing how conceited this guy was. &quot;Oh, oops, I forgot, you're the President of the &quot;Oh so Elite&quot; group of people who are honored by having you actually like them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seth shook his head, still smiling at her. &quot;You'd expect that, wouldn't you. That I would actually try to estrange myself from all humanity.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Serina...I've never said that, and I never plan to. I am exactly like everyone else, I just...don't happen to like the fact, and express it by staying as far away from people as I possibly can. That just shows how much you don't know about me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Serina's mouth hung agape, she shook her head. Every word Seth had uttered absolutely amazed her. &quot;Wow...&quot;<br>
<br>
Seth looked to her. &quot;You do happen to be a great person to talk to.&quot; He smiled and got up, walking out of the class easily, leaving her behind.<br>
<br>
Her face was taken over by confusion. Great? Was she great because she was so naive and was in awe because of his knowledge, or was she great because she was actually great. She shrugged it off, and sat down in her normal seat, when she felt Chris tap her shoulder, she turned to face him. <br>
<br>
Chris smiled up at her, giving her his cutest puppy dog face. &quot;Would it help if I said I was really and truly sorry?&quot;<br>
<br>
Serina bit her lip, not knowing what to say. &quot;Uh...that, and...&quot;<br>
<br>
Chris smiled and kissed her lightly on the cheek. &quot;That, and I was going to ask you out to the movies tonight.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh really? And what time might this movie start.&quot; Serina replied, knowing the bell was about to ring and walking towards the door.<br>
<br>
Chris smiled, standing in front of her so she couldn't leave, and grabbed her hands softly, looking into her eyes. &quot;However late you want, and it's on me, the whole way.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood on her tiptoes and kissed Chris softly on the lips. &quot;Okay, I'll go, only if you promise me that you won't forget again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chris smiled, returning the kiss and looked to Serina, a playful smile tugging at his lips. &quot;I won't...I promise.&quot;<br>
<br>
Serina glanced at her watch. &quot;The bell's about to ring.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chris nodded, and then smiled at her. &quot;I know, I think the next period I have with you is after lunch. Serina...do you like Kyle, or Seth?&quot; He said, looking down at her, a worried expression cast upon his features.<br>
<br>
Serina knew what to do in situations like these. Andrya had done it plenty of times. She brushed his lips onto his, and walked out the door, calling after her: &quot;Now don't you worry about them, I'm yours, until you stop calling, See you during lunch, save a seat for me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Chris looked to her chuckling softly, and walked out the door as the bell rung, hoping what she had said was true. <p>--------<br>

<br>
&quot;I can't wait til lunch hour...&quot; she mumbled. She started mumbling other things, and then stopped when she noticed the odd looks she was getting from people.<br>
<br>
&quot;Was she talking to herself?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I think she was...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What a weirdo!&quot;<br>
<br>
Jade clenched a fist. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>'Stupid little....'</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought.<br>
<br>
She opened her hand as she closed her locker. <br>

'Very interesting... This place is full of possible slaves...' The demonic elf disguised himself as a human once more and walked in. He didn't care to go get signed up. He decided that he would grab any worth taking and get out before anyone noticed. &quot;That's always the best way to do things.&quot; he muttered to himself.  &quot;Quick and clean.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Black/Blue haired Kuro with a braid down the back of his head and gold colored eyes continued through a hall full of young people. <br>
<br>
He froze. There were more...interesting... people here than he thought. 'Could those aura's actually be Gods?' He looked around, glaring slightly. 'Not to mention all the mages and other oddities. This place is a regular slave farm. They are all very strong, yet there are a good few who have a good ways to grow yet.' A young girl walked into him. &quot;Hey! Watch it!&quot; He yelled out.<br>
<br>
Kerri looked up, alarmed. &quot;Oh! I'm so sorry!&quot; She looked behind her. &quot;I gotta go!&quot; she yelled out as the same guys who had locked her in the locker before came around a corner and spotted her.<br>
<br>
Kuro didn't really care about school bullies, but he really needed someone to take out his anger on. &quot;You caused her to run into me?&quot; He growled, convincing himself that was all the reason he needed. He made 3 small, marble sized, energy balls in his hand. All three hit their targets in the boys' stomaches. <br>
<br>
They blacked out instantly. He looked down disgusted. 'They aren't very strong, but they'd be good slaves. Better not kill them yet.' He looked back at the girl. 'A mortal. A STUPID MORTAL??? That's what they were chasing?! She's not even worth killing let alone trading as a slave!'<br>
<br>
He fumed silently as she came up. &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; She held out her hand. &quot;I owe you. If you ever need any help, let me know and I'll do the best I can. What's your name?&quot; She was very thankful that she didn't have to pick her way out of another locker.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kurt. Just call me Kurt. And if you CAN ever repay me, it'll be a surprise to both of us.&quot; He turned, intending to leave it at that.<br>
<br>
Kerri followed anyway, keeping a good ways off, but keeping him in sight. He could sense her. 'Damn! What is it with these persistant humans?!'<br>
<br>
He ducked inside a class room, determined to both keep his identity a secret and get rid of this girl.<br>
<br>
Kerri lost him and walked on to her class. 'Oh, well. I'm sure this won't be the last time he's in the hallway.' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chococow>Choco Cow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dark Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 579<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/28/03 3:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=148>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: next class period... joy....</span><hr size=1> Steven looked over to Samantha and passed her a note.<br>
