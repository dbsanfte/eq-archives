It is Saturday, the day before Easter.  We have experienced very special gifts over the past few weeks that seemed to be topped off with the freshness of some much needed thundershowers that have been on and off all day long.  Jaci is right now resting very comfortably in her new air bed!  Over the past several weeks Jaci has been able to see both Sister's, her brother and his family and then the past two weeks with Donna and Herb staying with us.  I would have a hard time listing all the special times and moments we were able to experience over these past two weeks during Donna and Herb' visit!  Two weeks ago, adustments in her meds changed Jaci from a very groggy/druggy mindset to an absolute angel.  I will always remember these two weeks as it was so beautiful for everyone.  We sure did eat well with Donna's cooking and the graciousness of meals so many families from our church have provided.  Donna and Herb spent a lot of precious time and moments with Jaci and it was great that she was not druggied out.  Donna and Herb are very special people in their own right.  I am truly humbled with the view and perspective I see through my looking glass.  I am awed by Jaci and her strength and I am awed by all the care so many have provided to her and the specialness I was witness to these past two weeks.  I am a very lucky person and we have seen and heard many cardinals!<br>
<br>
Sam has been home for the past few weekends and has just a month or so left his his freshmen year at Washburn.  He has really taken to his first year at Wasburn and is very helpful when here.  Heidi has also been very helpful.  She has a little over a month left in her sophmore year and from the looks of her progress reports has kept her grades in focus.  While Heidi will drive herself to Easter services, Sam has to open at the golf course so Jaci and I will spend a quiet Easter at home.  Pastor Jay was able to drop in today, so we are using this as an excuse to sleep in tommorow!!  We will do a little grill tommorow afternoon before Sam heads back to Topeka.  <br>
<br>
Hope this update finds everyone in good health and again, to everyone, Jaci and I thank you for all the thoughts, prayers, visits, cards, flowers, meals, e-mails, and forum messages.  We are looking for some very beautiful walks in the coming days as mother nature has provided a very refreshing uplift today in more ways than one.  Donna the flowers look beautiful and Herb the Birch trees are stunning!   How appropriate has the rain of today been so refreshing to the spirt of the moment in more ways than one!   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> marsha h</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(4/20/03 12:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbudignetfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Easter Sunday</span><hr size=1> Dear Dan and Jac,  Joel  is down so he checked my settings and things should be fine now.  <br>

Lots of rain means lots of green growth.  I'll enjoy the sun coming out, though, so that I can see all the spring changes.<br>
<br>
I talked to Mom and she reported that you all shared some smiles and laughter over the last two weeks.  That warmed my heart immeasureably, Jaci.  <br>

The grass here is very green and I've planted lots of flowers.  The only problem with the grass is I have to mow, mow,  mow - especially now that Craig has fertilized it.
