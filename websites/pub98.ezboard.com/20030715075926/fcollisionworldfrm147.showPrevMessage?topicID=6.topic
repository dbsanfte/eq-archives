<br>
Enari silently walked through the woods...<br>
thinking.<br>
<br>
He kept turning Kirin over and over in his mind.<br>
<br>
::Why do i feel so close to her? Why? How do i know if she's having a dream or not?:: He kept asking himself over and over.<br>
<br>
The thought stayed in his mind until her face quickly flashed in his mind's eye and then quickly disappeared.<br>
<br>
::She's having one... or had one...:: he sighed.<br>
<br>
He was very confused... in all his years of living he'd never been able to sense these things about her.<br>
<br>
He was used to people who tried to hide the strange things about them...<br>
He was used to deceiving people easily... but he hadn't deceived Kirin. SHe somehow knew that he wasn't the person he appeared to be.<br>
His quiet and mysterious nature made people wonder who he was... <br>
his mysterious side made people ask...<br>
and his quiet side never answered.<br>
People were always ticked by this... but he didn't care.<br>
He hated everything.<br>
Especially Pheonix.<br>
He hated all becuase he was raised that way. His oldest master, a wizard named Falin, had taken him in. <br>
His mother had &quot;used&quot; a shadow liroun for a night... she was a vampire. <br>
She had gotten pregnant... and didn't want to take care of him.<br>
Maybe that's why he hated all... was becuase all hated him.<br>
No one had ever cared about him before... just about his abilities and powers. He was always being used by people.. one after the other.<br>
Pheonix had been using him for over a hundred years now... Enari hated Pheonix. THe only reason he stayed was to get more powerful.<br>
<br>
::As soon as i obtain the power of the stars... i'll kill him:: <br>
<br>
He was thinking about the crystal staff... which gave the ability to use white and &quot;crystal&quot; magic such as... well. No one really knew what it gave... but was rumored to be powerful.<br>
All he knew was he needed to be just a little more powerful.<br>
He was much weaker than Pheonix... but Enari's element was water/ice... and Pheonix's was fire.<br>
He would defeat Pheonix with one swift blow...<br>
<br>
&quot;Gay bastard&quot; he muttered under his breath<br>
<br>
&quot;AAAAAAAIIIIIIEEEEEEEE!!!!!!&quot; a hideous screech came from hearby.<br>
<br>

<br>
another hideous screech came from nearby.<br>
<br>
::why now?:: he sighed... <br>
<br>
right then a tall figure broke through the bushes.<br>
It was tall, being around 7 feet tall. It had a ugly greenish glow and tint to it... it's arms and legs were disgustingly long and his fingers and toes were like sticks.<br>
<br>
The creature's eyes were big and black... it's head was a queer almost cone shape and it had long pointy ears.<br>
Only holes were on it's face for holes and it's long needle-like teeth were dripping with saliva.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who isssssss you? Why issssssss you here?&quot; It hissed at Enari who only glared in response.<br>
<br>
&quot;Assssssswer meeeee!&quot; It screamed.<br>
<br>
Enari shook his head and stood there.<br>
The ghunein lundged at him and Enari jumped out of the way.<br>
<br>
&quot;You basssssstard!!!!&quot; It hollered at him, running at him with his humongous battle axe.<br>
<br>
&quot;come back heresssssss you foool!&quot; It ran right up to Enari and Enari dodged again and then jumped up and landed as hard as he could on top of the ghunein.<br>
<br>
The ghunein fell under the impact.<br>
<br>
&quot;letssss me go!!!!!!!&quot; It started crying from pain.<br>
<br>
Enari luaghed and then took his water blade and stabbed it directly in the back.<br>
<br>
THe ghunein let out a most horrorific screech and then went limp.<br>
<br>
::that takes care of... no... there's more:: Enari turned around and listened.<br>
<br>
distant footsteps were heard... crashing and banging throughout the forest.<br>
<br>
Enari shook his head. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

<br>
Enari stood firmly and tall... over the ghunein he had just  killed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yoouu!!! Mussssssst die!&quot; one screeched.<br>
<br>
&quot;mussssst not come any nearer!!!&quot; Another's sline-tingling voice came.<br>
<br>
Enari smiled at them, challenging them to try to kill him.<br>
<br>
THey all came at him at once, all 21 of them.<br>
<br>
Enari dodged the first three blows by ducking, then came up from underneath and sliced one in half.<br>
<br>
He turned around quickly and jumped over another, spinning around and slicing two more head's off.<br>
<br>
He landed in front of a short one who started running around in circles... getting ready to whip him with a long thick bull-whip.<br>
<br>
Enari stuck his sword out just in time, slicing the little guy's arm off. It screeched loudly as Enari's hand glowed and a burst of ice shot out at it and froze it.<br>
<br>
A ghunein came up behind him and Enari turned around and jumped over it... running up to a huge mound of steep rocks.<br>
<br>
THe ghunein had cornered him... or so it thought.<br>
<br>
Enari quickly ran up the wall, doing a back flip, landing on his feet.<br>
<br>
The ghunein turned around, but nut quick enough as Enari ran up to him and jumped on him.<br>
<br>
Another five rushed at him after he was done slicing the other one.<br>
<br>
Enari's stepped forward, turning, slicing, dodging, and jumping as if he were in a dance... a beutiful dance. His moves were timed perfectly... and were smooth and fluid.<br>
<br>
He sliced one after another... until each one was lying on the groud... blood spilt everywhere. <p>&quot;I'm not afraid of the Darkness!&quot; -Riku, Kingdom Hearts<br>

ENari started running... like a burst of wind.<br>
He put his swords away quickly as he did... <br>
he knew of a small village he could rest at for a night... away from ghunein territory.<br>
He wouldn't go into town... just rest on the outskirts...<br>

Marth ran through the forest... listening to the screeches behind and ahead of him.<br>
<br>
He ran up in an opening... and gasped.<br>
<br>
A ghunein slaughter had occured.<br>
<br>
::What in the world happened here?:: his thoughts wandered as he looked around.<br>
<br>
&quot;AAAAAIIIIEEEE!!!!!&quot; A screech rang through the forest.<br>
