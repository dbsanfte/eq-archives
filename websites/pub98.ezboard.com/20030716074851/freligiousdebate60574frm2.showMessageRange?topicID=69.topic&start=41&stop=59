So, in your estimation, it's more acceptable for these folks to what--remain celibate their entire lives, possibly miserable, and never entering into a loving relationship? Or should they &quot;suck it up&quot; and partner with a member of the opposite sex, with someone they are NOT physically or emotionally attracted to, and never be truly happy? How is that fair to anyone? Why, according to people that share your belief, should these people not have the option to be happy?<br>
What exactly is acceptable behaviour for gay people, in your opinion? <br>
And yes, homosexuality is found in many instances in the animal kingdom.<br>

<br>
I think I figured something out - <br>
Not only because I was raised in the Christian church from birth (seriously, I was in church when I was like 2 weeks old), and the longest I ever stepped away from it was for like 2 months, but also because I seriously do not know a single gay person - personally. <br>
<br>
Maybe that's why I can't comprehend the emotional side of what everyone else here seems to be understanding regarding the gay community.  I don't know what it's like to be gay, nor do I know anyone to be gay.  Is that intentional?  Do I distance myself from gays?  No.  I just don't have a life that puts me in with the gay community.  My life is that of a SAH wife and mom who goes to church on Sundays, and school one night a week. (Which is a Bible college at that)  My friends are people I have common interests with and ex-coworkers...none of which happen to be gay.  It's just been that direction my life has taken that I have not become involved in the lives of anyone who is gay.  Maybe if I had family members that were gay, I would know and understand their side- but for now this is all I have to go on, and what my beliefs have always been on the subject. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Live your life so the preacher won't have to lie at your funeral.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fireofpsyche>fire of psyche</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of the Matrix</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/15/03 3:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=69.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rialian.com/elvens~1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How does Jehovah's dislike of homosexuality affect your.</span><hr size=1> Paul wrote 1Corinthians. Paul never met nor remotely knew Jesus. 1Corinthians was written at approx. 55AD.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Paul lists many activities that will prevent people from inheriting the Kingdom of God (heaven). This verse has been translated in many ways among the 25 English versions of the Bible analyzed. The two activities of interest here have been variously translated as: <br>
<br>
--<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>effeminate</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> which covers a wide range of male behavior such as being unmanly, lacking virility, decadent, soft. (KJV, Phillips) <br>
 <br>
--<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>homosexuals</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, described as: <br>
 &quot;men who practice homosexuality,&quot; (ESV); <br>
 &quot;those who participate in homosexuality,&quot; (Amplified);  <br>
 &quot;abusers of themselves with men,&quot; (KJV);  <br>
 &quot;practicing homosexuals,&quot; (NAB);  <br>
 &quot;homosexuals,&quot; (NASB);   <br>
 &quot;homosexual perversion,&quot; (NEB);   <br>
 &quot;homosexual offenders,&quot; (NIV);  <br>
 &quot;sodomites,&quot; (NRSV);  <br>
 &quot;liers with mankind,&quot; (Rhiems); and  <br>
 &quot;homosexual perverts.&quot; (TEV)  <br>
<br>
Apparently, lesbians are not included in many of these condemnations.<br>
 <br>
The NIV contains the phrase: &quot;homosexual offenders.&quot;  Suppose for the moment that Paul had written &quot;heterosexual offenders&quot; or &quot;heterosexual sexual offenders.&quot; We would not interpret this today as a general condemnation of heterosexuality; only of those heterosexuals who commit sexual offences. Perhaps the appropriate interpretation of this verse is that it does not condemn homosexuals. Rather it condemns homosexuals who engage in sexual offences. <br>
 <br>
The original Greek text describes the two behaviors as &quot;malakoi&quot; (some sources quote &quot;malakee,&quot; and &quot;arsenokoitai.&quot; Although this is often translated by modern Bibles as &quot;homosexual,&quot; we can be fairly certain that this is not the meaning that Paul wanted to convey. If he had, he would have used the Greek word &quot;paiderasste.&quot; That was the standard term at the time for male homosexuals. We can conclude that he probably meant something different from male-male adult sex. &quot;Malakoi&quot; is translated in both Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 as &quot;soft&quot; (KJV) or as &quot;fine&quot; (NIV) in references to clothing. It could also mean &quot;loose&quot; or &quot;pliable,&quot; as in the phrase &quot;loose morals,&quot; implying &quot;unethical behavior.&quot; In the early Christian church, the words were interpreted by some as referring to persons who are pliable, easily influenced, without courage or stability. Non-Biblical writings of the era used the world to refer to lazy men, men who cannot handle hard work, and cowards. &quot;Arsenokoitai&quot; is made up of two parts: &quot;arsen&quot; means &quot;man&quot;; &quot;koitai&quot; means &quot;beds.&quot; The Septuagint (an ancient, pre-Christian translation of the Old Testament into Greek) translated the Hebrew &quot;quadesh&quot; in I Kings 14:24, 15:12 and 22:46 as &quot;arsenokoitai.&quot; They were referring to &quot;male temple prostitutes&quot; - people who engaged in ritual sex in Pagan temples. Some leaders in the early Christian church also thought that it meant temple prostitutes. Some authorities believe that it simply means male prostitutes with female customers - a practice which appears to have been a common practice in the Roman empire. One source refers to other writings which contained the word &quot;arsenokoitai:&quot; (Sibylline Oracles 2.70-77, Acts of John; Theophilus of Antioch Ad Autolycum). They suggest that the term refers &quot;to some kind of economic exploitation by means of sex (but no necessarily homosexual sex).&quot; Probably &quot;pimp&quot; or &quot;man living off of the avails of prostitution&quot; would be the closest English translations. <br>
 <br>
Still others thought that it meant &quot;masturbators.&quot; At the time of Martin Luther, the latter meaning was universally used. But by the 20th century, masturbation had become a more generally accepted behavior. So, new translations abandoned references to masturbators and switched the attack to homosexuals. The last religious writing in English that interpreted 1 Corinthians 6:9 as referring to masturbation is believed to be the [Roman] Catholic Encyclopedia of 1967. <br>
 <br>
1 Timothy 1:9-10:<br>
These verses also refer to malakoi arsenokoitai which has been variously translated as &quot;homosexuals,&quot; &quot;sexual perverts,&quot; &quot;pederasts,&quot; etc. As in 1 Corinthians 6:9 (above), the original meaning of the text as been lost. Liberal theologians believe that this Epistle was not written by St. Paul, but was composed by an anonymous author circa 100 to 150 CE, up to 85 years after St. Paul's execution. <br>

Not picking on you Candy - but I don't know anyone (that I'm aware of) that is gay in real life either.  <br>

I don't think you need to be able to understand the emotional side of it all to be able to accept it.  <br>

<br>
I'm not picking on you either, but I have a legitimate question that no fundamentalist has ever been able to answer--and I've asked many times.  You said this:<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry if it is unacceptable to you or anyone else, but he's not going to be raised thinking that homosexuality is okay if 'that's who you really are', because I don't believe it is the way any of us were created. &quot;<br>
<br>
My 20-year-old nephew is gay.  He told me he has known this since 5th grade, but he did not tell anyone in his family until he was 15.  This kid has been through hell because of his sexual orientation--he had to change schools because he was harrassed so much and was physically threatened.  He agonized over whether to tell his parents because of fear they would not love him anymore or would kick him out.  Things got so bad at one point he almost committed suicide.  The suicide rate for gay teens is very high.  So that begs the question--why would anyone *choose* to be gay when they have to live in fear of being ostracized or harmed because of it?  It is a very hard and painful road, and people often try to hide it out of shame or fear.  My nephew was never molested and had no gay friends or relatives as roll models.  He was raised in a Christian home.  How do you explain his being attracted to men other than he was born that way?  How can anyone possibly call this a choice when there are gay people who want *so* badly not to be because the consequences are so great?  (And please, no explanations involving Satan!)<br>
<br>
I do hope for the sake of your son that he is not gay.  But being raised in a Christian home and being taught it is wrong will not influence his orientation.  It just may mean that you will never know about.<br>
<br>
I really would be interested to hear your take on this.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

If you have ever been in a relationship, that is exactly what it is like to be in a gay relastionship.  They love, they exasperate, they do everything the same.  Where the difference rises is in how the world treats them.  Just like in HS when a gma caught you kissing, it was scorned and noit understood, they get the same, only amplified 10,000 times.  Some areas in the country demonize them.  Some places celebrate it.  But as far as inside the framework of the relationship, it is exactly the same.  You love, you desire to please and be pleased by your partner, you feel insecure at the begining, nervous over yourself and later grow strong with confidence as your acceptance of each other strengthens.  It is no different.  It is the same love.  To say 'they can't have kids' is the same that could be said to an infertile couple, and just as untrue.<br>
<br>
A funny thing, I have stood next to people I knew for years and heard them say &quot;I don't know any atheists&quot; and been dumbfounded.  Just because they aren't hitting on your husband or wearing pink argyll sweaters and skipping around the mall with latex handbags doesn't mean they might not be gay.<br>

Actually Candy, Lev. 18 states that women are unclean for the entirety of their menses plus 7 days afterwards, which means completely off limits about 14 days per month. While this may suit your personal preferences, I don't hear you speaking out against your xian sisters who conveniently dismiss this teaching while using Lev. 18 to condemn homosexuals. <br>

Well, it's kinda like:<br>
<br>
You wake up in the morning. At some point, get a shower and other morning cleaning routine stuff. Hopefully eat breakfast, but who knows? Maybe you're late for work or school (or getting the kids to school. If that's an option, throw in &quot;get everyone else in the house ready to go too&quot; in there). Go somewhere (work, school, store...). At some point eating lunch is ideal. Picking up kids or leaving work tends to happen. Coming back home and fixing dinner (well, hell, why not order pizza? Gay people do that too, you know). End the evening by: watching tv, reading, spending time with partner, putting kids to bed, or posting messages to internet bulletin boards. Maybe pay some bills or clean up the living space. Go to bed. Sleep.<br>

<br>
You say you don't understand the emotional side of it.<br>
<br>
Let me try to give you an example here (And forgive me if I jump from idea to idea... I am at the end of my pg and I am tired and cranky).<br>
<br>
I don't know if you have ever experienced depression. I have and for most of my teen years, I was told that I could just be happy if I really wanted to. I was told to pray about it and Jesus would make it better. I was told that it is a state of mind. I was also told that I was just a spoiled child that just wanted her way (by my dad). After hearing that for years (and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>TRYING</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to change), my mild depression turned into major depression. I attempted suicide a couple times (which I felt terrible about afterwards because I was taught suicide is one of those 'unforgivable sins'). It was a very long battle. I delt with it from the time I was in 6th grade (12) until I had my last child (in 2000 I was 27). I tried counceling, meds, groups, hospitalization and a combination of these things. Finally, after a complete break down (in combination of having OCD) after the birth of dd#2 (She was a high needs baby and I was not prepared for the intensity of it) I went to a new psy and he prescribed me a newer med. It was like night and day once the meds kicked in. After all the fog cleared away, I realized that I was not under complete control over my feelings. It was something chemical in my brain (very low levels of seritonin... ironically, there was another med called Serizone that I took in '97 that worked well, but it caused me to lactate even though my dd had not nursed for 13 months <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   so I had to stop it). For people who have never gone through depression, it is hard to even understand that people can feel depressed and not snap out of it (I have had debates about this on the Feb 03 birth bb for a few weeks now) For the record, my dad is now completly understanding of my depression. It took his mil to be severly depressed and loosing her will to live (her dh has just passed away) and when she started on meds, she was a different person. <br>
<br>
Most people who are lesbian, gay, trans, or bi are not that way because they made a decision. They are just that way (kind of like someone who is depressed). It is not a choice. It is just the way people are.<br>
<br>
I realize that the bible says that homosexuality is wrong, but it is the same bible that says that multiple personalities are demon possession (I do not remember the verse, but it is where Jesus dirves out the spirits in a man and sends them into pigs that run over a cliff). I do not remember if there are any verses in there about depression, but I was told once that it was demons that caused it. Obviously, I don't believe that now.<br>
<br>

I had never thought to liken it with depression before. But you know, I think you are right. People who have never been depressed (don't those people just piss you off? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) don't get it. My mom just has no clue. She knows I can't just snap out of it, but she doesn't understand why emotionally. She always could. Its ironic but the depressed runs through HER side of the family and is more then likely where mine has come from.<br>
<br>
However, I would be careful about likening it to depression which is treatable with drugs. Next thing we know they will want to drug up homosexuals to make them &quot;normal&quot; again. <br>

I had thought about that (depression being treated with meds = sexual prefrence being treated the same way). I guess the point I was trying to make is that it is not something that could just be changed. Heck! If there was a medication that would make a gay man attracted to women, how much do you want to bet that as soon as he went off the meds, he would prefer men again. (What if there was a medication to make men prefer other men. Would that make them gay?) I have to be medicated my entire life. As soon as I get off my medication, I fall down that dark hole again and cannot climb back out myself. I will always have depression. That is who I am.<br>
<br>
I guess a better parallel would be skin color. If someone is born with dark skin (Say an African American), they are always of that desent. It doesn't matter what they do to themselves to lighten themselves... they will always be of African desent. I mean, look at Michael Jackson. It doesn't matter if his skin lightening was because of a medical condition or if he did it intentionally, he now has white skin... BUT he will always be African American. Being gay is sooo similar to that. Many people of a different sexual orientation try and try to change, and some will even take on a life of a &quot;straight&quot; person, but it does not change who they really are. <br>
<br>
Honestly, It makes me sad that many people judge so blindly. I had a friend in HS who came out as gay. He first did it in his own school district, but his parents disowned him and he was forced to become an emancipated minor and move to the school system I was going to. He was terrified to tell me, my best friend and my boyfriend (now dh) that he was gay. I think when he told us and it didn't bother us either way, he felt like a terrible burden was lifted off his shoulders. He was a great guy (really cute too) and the only thing he ever did to piss me off was when he asked my bf to kiss him. Believe me... I told him that that was not approperiate whether he was gay or not... he was MY boyfriend (and it weirded my dh out for a moment too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  At least I can look back on it and laugh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I am going off on a tangent again... *sigh*<br>

I can't imagine ever kicking my child out for such a reason. My Dh and I were the first straight people our friend came out to. But we knew before he admitted it to himself. He was very afraid to come out to his parents. But they accepted him so completely when he did. And are very happy that he is now emotionally stable and happy with himself. They are great models for parents whose children come out too. They accept him totally and completely. Pretty impressive considering his dad is retired military.<br>
<br>
When I decided to go off my anti-depressants I was warned by my doctor at the time that the depression more then like WILL come back. Maybe 5 years or 20 years, but to be prepared to admit it to myself and get back on the medication before it got too badly. I think the only reason it hasn't is because I'm just too damn busy to be depressed. That and I've put off medication when I should have been on it. But I didn't want to take anything while pregnant and that was the worse so far. But the times between are getting less and less.

I had a friend who tried so hard to be straight. She was engaged to an ex-boyfriend of mine when she finally admitted to herself she couldn't do it. it was his support and understanding that helped her do it. <br>

Still even if you don't like it there shouldn't be discrimination or laws against it. It doesn't affect anyone but that person. It should even affect their families. It certainly doesn't hurt you. They should be afforded the same rights as heterosexuals and allowed the legal union of marriage. <br>

FILM REVIEW<br>
<br>
By Lawrence Van Gelder<br>
<br>
To the growing body of invaluable cinematic literature documenting for posterity the hideous barbarity of Nazism may now be added &quot;Paragraph 175.&quot;<br>
<br>
At once admirable and deeply unsettling, this film draws upon the testimony of little more than a handful of the all-but-vanished ranks of survivors to relate the horror of the Nazi purge of homosexuals from the life of Germany and the aftereffects that scar and roil these men as the 21st century begins.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am ashamed for humanity,&quot; says one of the survivors as he recounts his personal ordeal and the horrors visited on those he knew.<br>
<br>
&quot;Paragraph 175,&quot; opening today at the Film Forum, was directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman. Together they won an Academy Award for their documentary &quot;Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt,&quot; after Mr. Epstein won an Oscar, among many other awards, for &quot;The Times of Harvey Milk,&quot; which will be revived at the Film Forum, starting on Friday.<br>
<br>
This year their new documentary, to run through Sept. 26, won the grand jury award for directing at the Sundance Film Festival and the International Film Critics Association Award at the Berlin International Film Festival.<br>
<br>
&quot;Paragraph 175,&quot; using new and archival film, family photographs and narration by the actor Rupert Everett, takes its title from a portion of the German penal code enacted in 1871: &quot;An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex or by humans with animals is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of civil rights may also be imposed.&quot;<br>
<br>
This provision, expanded by the Nazis, remained law in West and East Germany until nearly the end of the 1960’s. Some of the film’s witnesses were rearrested under this law after the defeat of the Nazis. During the years of the Weimar Republic, between the end of World War I and the rise of Hitler, Paragraph 175 was rarely enforced, and the Berlin of the 1920’s was, in the words and images of the film, &quot;a homosexual Eden.&quot; <br>
<br>
According to the filmmakers, who drew upon German records and were assisted by Klaus Muller, a German historian and the project director for Western Europe for the United States Holocaust Museum, about 100,000 men were arrested for homosexuality between 1933, when Hitler assumed power, and 1945, when World War II ended. About half were sentenced to prison; 10,000 to 15,000 were sent to concentration camps, and by the end of the war, only about 4,000 of those in the camps had survived. Of the eight known to be alive, six appear in &quot;Paragraph 175.&quot;<br>
<br>
Because women were regarded by the Nazis as vessels of motherhood, lesbians were spared mass arrest. Some chose exile; others entered into marriages with gay men. Only one woman, who escaped to England, tells her story in the film.<br>
<br>
Mr. Muller, the film’s associate producer and director of research, notes that he grew up in Germany without ever hearing of the persecution of its gays.<br>
<br>
Among the male survivors seen in &quot;Paragraph 175,&quot; one tells of torture; another recalls a daring but vain attempt to rescue his lover from a Gestapo camp by donning a Hitler Youth uniform; a third remembers his years in concentration camps; and yet another tells how he was released from prison during the war only to find that all the men were gone. So, he says, he joined the German Army because &quot;that’s where the men were.&quot;<br>
<br>
And one of them tells of &quot;the singing forest,&quot; where the agony of gay men subjected to torture wailed from the poles on which they were hanging.<br>
<br>
For generations to come, &quot;Paragraph 175&quot; lets them be heard.<br>
<br>
PARAGRAPH 175:<br>
<br>
Directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman; written (in English, German and French, with English subtitles) by Sharon Wood; director of photography, Bernd Meiners; edited by Dawn Logsdon; music by Tibor Szemzo; produced by Mr. Epstein, Mr. Friedman, Michael Ehrenzweig and Janet Cole; released by New Yorker Films. At the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village. Running time: 81 minutes. This film is not rated.<br>
