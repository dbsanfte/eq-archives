A solitaire figure strolled toward me.  My hopes rose and then faded again as the figure strolled by me.  How long had it been since I had heard from him, my love.  My heart was breaking.  This was the longest I had been without him.  I walked across the sand hoping, and then as I saw the first twinkle of the stars and no Willard, I sat down and began to cry.  No one was around to see me, no one cared.  <br>
  “Why do you weep?”  I heard a voice from behind me say.  It was slightly familiar, I voice that had been in my dreams.  It was a voice that searched for me.  I didn’t answer.  I didn’t even turn around.  Fear rushed over me.  Was this what I have been running from?  The truth; is my love dead, or am I dead to him?  If he loved me why hasn’t he called or e-mailed?  What was the truth?  <br>
  I felt a hand on my shoulder.  It was cold and I knew this was not a man but a creature like my love had become.  I saw myself turning around in my mind and felt my body doing just that.  I fought it, I resisted but my body didn’t listen.  What I saw was a beautiful sculptured man. I have seen him in my dreams. His almond shaped eyes had the colors of the rainbow hidden in them.  They pierced my soul.  His cat-like mouth twisted upward and his blond hair rustled in the breeze. He stood there as if he was drawn out of a comic book, formed and shaped as if some forgotten hero had been brought to life through his body. He has been calling me.  I felt him wrap his arms about me…<br>
  “Sara,” he whispered in my ear.  I swooned in his arms.  His strength was my only support.  I saw his grin.  His white fangs flashed in the moon light.  <br>
<br>
I gasped….<br>
<br>
Startled awake, I realized it was only a dream.  I was drenched in my own sweat.  Where was Willard? I got out my bed and went to the bathroom.  I looked at myself in the mirror.  My face had pimples by my chin.  I knew that they were caused by stress.  I found a bruise on my thigh caused in my sleep as I struggled with the nightmare I have been having ever since my return from San Diego. It has been almost three weeks since I have seen Willard and one since I have last spoke with him.  Am I going mad?  I don’t need him to survive the normal world but now I was part of the underworld, the world of darkness.  I needed him to survive there.  I knew that, unless….<br>
  I brushed the thought aside.  Maybe that was what my dreams were telling me.  I love him too much to go seeking for my own power.  I would rather die than to live without Willard.  The conflict in my own brain was unbearable.  I picked up the phone but had no one to call.  Willard didn’t have a cell.  He says that when he needs a phone he knows how to access them.  And that is what I wonder about, he can hack into the phone company and access any computer or phone line he wants, why hasn’t he called me?<br>
  I go back to my bed and lay awake with that question burning through my skull.<br>

It was about 7 p.m. the sun was just setting.  The room smelled of leather upholstery and roses that were in the middle of the table.  I was the first. The projector was seated in the ceiling and the remote and cable hook-ups were professionally set as to have any computer or laptop connect to it.  I started setting up my laptop and preparing for my presentation.  The other lawyers and business partners were not expected to be here until 8.  I had some time.  As I completed my task and pulled the white screen down to test the projector, a man walked in.  I was pre-occupied so I didn't turn around, the he asked, &quot;Are you Sara?&quot;  My heart leapt out of my body.  I knew that voice I had heard it in my dreams.  I turned around and there was the vision of my dream in flesh and blood.  I gasped and let go the the projector screen, which then flew up to add to my startled reaction.  And in that moment the phone in the office rang.  <br>
  &quot;Can you excuse me?&quot; I said and then ran to answer the phone. I picked up the phone and said, &quot;Sara Anjeal Attorney at Law.  How can I help you?&quot;  The other end of the phone was silence.  I turned back to check on the man and no one was there.  &quot;Hello?&quot; I said to the silence on the phone...  nothing.  I went back to the projector screen, pulled a chair up to it and grabbed the string and stepped off the chair.  The screen unraveled with no trouble.  I then looked down the hall.  I saw the janitor, who had a buffer running on the wooden floor. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; I said as I tapped him on the shoulder.<br>
  &quot;jes,'ow can I 'elp ju?&quot; His Spanish accent rolled off his tongue.<br>
  &quot;There was a man that was just in here.  Did you happen to see him?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Dere waz no man. I 'ave been 'ere for 30 minutes and saw no one.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=102.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=102.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=102.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=102.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies" align=absmiddle> Click to receive email notification of replies</a><br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=102.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies" align=absmiddle> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a><br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm20">SchreckNET™ (Nos only)<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.242<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
