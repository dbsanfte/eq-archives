It has come to my attention that several people have become unhappy with my involvment with the Slipstream: Underground community. From the start I did nearly all the work in building and maintaining the site. I can see now this was a mistake. If the board is to survive it must come about through the people who claim to be running it, I can no longer do the work for you. Also I&#8217;m afraid that this board is only dividing whats left of the SlipstreamBBS community. I don&#8217;t want to see that happen. I suggest everyone join ExIsle and join together as one community.   - Lorne
