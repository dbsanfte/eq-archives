Cincinnati Bengals - Eric Steinbach - OL - Iowa - Good pick here, he should have been a top 20 pick.  Will really help out their line.  Bengals drafting well thus far.   Grade: A-<br>
<br>
2. Detroit Lions - Boss Bailey - LB - Georgia - I couldn't think of a better possible situation for the Lions, this is a top 15 talent, with sub 4.4 speed at the linebacker position.  Tell me how he fell this far?  Grade: A<br>
<br>
3. Chicago Bears - Charles Tillman - CB - Louisiana-Layafette - I swear some of these teams sit down and smoke crack before they draft.  This guy isn't a top 100 player on any list I've seen.  They couldn't have gotten this guy or a similar player in the third or fourth, please.  This is the worst pick in the draft so far.  Grade: F<br>
<br>
4. New England Patriots - Eugene Wilson - CB - Illinois - This is a solid pick.  This is a need area for them, he could start right away, or spell the aging and borderline Otis Smith.  Grade: B+<br>
<br>
5. New Orleans Saints - Jon Stinchcomb - OT - Georgia - Do they have some kind of fetish with Georgia players or something?  This is a good pick, Stinchcomb was a riser, and they needed a tackle.  Grade: B<br>
<br>
6. Dallas Cowboys - Al Johnson - C - Wisconsin - This is slightly high for him, but its a big need on this team.  Walter did a good job, but he was a tackle in college just last year.  Grade: C+<br>
<br>
7. Jacksonville Jaguars - Rashean Mathis - DB - Bethune-Cookman - He's a good prospect, and this was the region he was expected to go.  Good ball hawk, will likely play corner for them.  Grade: C+<br>
<br>
8. Minnesota Vikings - E.J. Henderson - LB - Maryland - This position has gone from very weak to very strong this year.  Henderson is solid value, and will be a solid NFL player.  Grade: B+<br>
<br>
9. Houston Texans - Bennie Joppru - TE - Michigan - They needed to go TE, but why Joppru ahead of Witten?  Seems odd, but Joppru is a decent player, and an improvement.  Grade: C+<br>
<br>
10. Seattle Seahawks - Ken Hamlin - S - Arkansas - They're all about drafting defensive backs.  He's a solid player, but is this more of a need than finding a good defensive lineman.  Grade: C-<br>
<br>
11. St. Louis Rams - Pisa Tinomousa - LB - Hawaii - This is their type of linebacker, undersized and speedy.  He's a slight reach here, but not too bad compared to last years draft picks.  Grade: C-<br>
<br>
12. Washington Redskins - Taylor Jacobs - WR - Florida - Wow is this a good pick for them.  Let us first state the obvious, this guy could come in today and probably play this system better than most of their receivers, he has first round value, and he's a Florida guy.  Great pick.  Grade: A<br>
<br>
13. New England Patriots - Bethel Johnson - WR - Texas A&amp;M - This guy is a reach.  He has risen up boards, but he plays like a 4th round prospect.  The Patriots fell in love with the 40 time, and reached on him.  Grade: D<br>
<br>
14. San Diego Chargers - Drayton Florence - DB - Tuskegee - Not a horrible pick value wise, but did they need to go here twice in the first two rounds?  I just don't see that big a need at this position.  I hope they expect him to play some FS cause thats what they need.  Grade: D+<br>
<br>
15. Kansas City Chiefs - Kawika Mitchell - LB - South Florida - This is a big reach.  He's rated at highest as a 4th round player for most teams and scouts.  They obviously saw something they liked.  Grade: D<br>
<br>
16. Buffalo Bills - Chris Kelsay - DE - Nebraska - The pick for McGahee is legitimized now that they got a mid first round player in the mid second round.  He should be an immediate help.  Grade: B+<br>
<br>
17. Miami Dolphins - Eddie Moore - LB - Tennessee - There have been some really bad picks thus far, but this ranks right up there.  This guy is a 2nd day prospect in probably everyones opinion but the Dolphins.  Why so many of these guys in the second?  I can see third but this is just bad.  They are obviously moving Derrick Rogers. Grade: D<br>
<br>
18. Carolina Panthers - Bruce Nelson - C - Iowa - He was rising of late, I had him in the mid second, so this isn't a bad pick.  However I'm a little surprised they went O-Line 2x so early.  Grade: C-<br>
<br>
19. Denver Broncos - Terry Pierce - LB - Kansas State - They got a quality player value wise and a need, size wise among their linebackers.  This is an excellent pick.  Grade: B+<br>
<br>
20. Cleveland Browns - Chaun Thompson - LB - West Texas A&amp;M - This is a bit of a reach in this position for the workout warrior.  They need linebackers so it isn't horrible.  Grade: C-<br>
<br>
21. New York Jets - Victor Hobson - LB - Michigan - Trying to get younger at the linebacker position.  He's not as bad a pick as some of these other 2nd round backer.  He should contribute this season on special teams.  Grade: C+<br>
<br>
22. Arizona Cardinals - Anquan Bolden - WR - Florida State - He is a first round player if he runs a sub 4.5, but he runs more like 4.6 at best.  He could be a stud because he plays faster.  Grade: B-<br>
<br>
23. Atlanta Falcons - Bryan Scott - DB - Penn State - He's a slight reach but he's got superb size for a DB, which is why he went so high.  Grade: D+<br>
<br>
24. New York Giants - Osi Umenyoira - DE - Troy State - The classic example of a team working out a player falling in love with him and then drafting him when they could have gotten him in the 5th round.  There is always some guy that I don't have in my top 500 prospects picked early, but this is a little high for that.  Grade: F--<br>
<br>
25. San Francisco 49ers - Anthony Adams - DT - Penn State - Maybe I should raise my standards to what a good pick is, cause some of these are aweful.  He's not as bad as many, he was a 3rd or 4th rounder, but he's severely short.  Grade: C-<br>
<br>
26. Indianapolis Colts - Mike Doss - S - Ohio State - After a run of truely poor attempts of draft picks, we finally have a good one.  Doss should have gone higher, but all these bad selections are forcing good college players like him down.  He could start immediatly.  Grade: A-<br>
<br>
27. Pittsburgh Steelers - Alonzo Jackson - DE - Florida State - He was rising up boards, but not to this extent.  He would have made a good 4th round pick.  But not here.  Grade: C-<br>
<br>
28. Tennessee Titans - Tyrone Calico - WR - Middle Tennessee State - They go with a guy close to them, he's pretty good value here, and he fits a need, which seems to be a rarity in the second round this year.  Grade: B<br>
<br>
29. Philadelphia Eagles - L.J. Smith - TE - Rutgers - No way Witten is the 4th best TE in this draft.  Smith has been rising.  They needed a backup.  Grade: C-<br>
<br>
30. San Diego Chargers - Terrence Keil - S - Texas A&amp;M - He was a rising player, but all I have to say is this reminds me of the Eagles draft last year!  DB-DB-DB.  This guy is there first major reach.  He's a fourth round guy.  Grade: D+<br>
<br>
31. Oakland Raiders - Teyo Johnson - WR - Stanford - Actually projected them taking him friday before draft.  Makes sense can learn the fine points of the position from the two greatest receivers of all-time.  Grade: B+<br>
<br>
32. Tampa Bay Buccanneers - DeWayne White - DE - Louisville - Another value pick.  Which looks really good considering what has gone on in the second round.  This was a need area because of the importance of this position on their team.  Grade: B+ <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnfldraftviewfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=35.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnfldraftviewfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=35.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnfldraftviewfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnfldraftviewfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=35.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnfldraftviewfrm2.threadControl?topicID=35.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnfldraftviewfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=35.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnfldraftviewfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=35.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="nfldraftviewfrm1">Announcements<option value="nfldraftviewfrm2">General Discussion<option value="nfldraftviewfrm3">Polls<option value="nfldraftviewfrm5">Help Files<option value="nfldraftviewfrm6">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#0000FF>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bnfldraftview>NFL Draft View</a><font color=#0000FF> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fnfldraftviewfrm2>General Discussion</a> <font color=#0000FF> - </font><a href="www.nfldraftview.com">The NFL Draft View</a><font color=#0000FF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
