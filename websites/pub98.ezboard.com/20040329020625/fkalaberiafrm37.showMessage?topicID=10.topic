<br>
Hmm as far as where she might be from, well we do have the whole modern world to choose from. Obviously she has ended up in New York City, but I am afraid there arn't very many forests in New York city. You could have her from Ugolasvia, I'm not sure about the spelling there. Or you could have from the Czech republic, anywhere in Northen America, Europe, even Asia. It all really depends on the ethnicity you want her to have in her human form.<br>
<br>
But one thing I definatly need you to post up is her skills and weaknesses, for example she could have a high skill of acrobatics in her human form, then in her were-wolf form she could have a high agility. Then for weaknesses you could do, lets see, silver could be lethal to her, or that she has a multiple personality disorder.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions on how to build your biography you are welcome to message me here through ezboard, or you can contact me on AIM my sn is RoseNyrene, or feel free to email me at kesmeltzer@hotmail.com. For an idea on how a were-creature's bio is set up you could also referance Vincent de Darkfang's bio and Cynthia's as well. I look forward to seeing what you come up with.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and color for you wolf form, hmm I have always been partial to white wolves, I think there is something just absolutly mystical about the way they look. But once more that is entirely up to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blindeserra@kalaberia>Blinde Serra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8B4513>(6/4/03 1:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Blinde Serra</span><hr size=1> White huh? Well I've always been partial to black... so lets hit th emiddle road with bright white silver. heh. <br>
<br>
And, like most descriptive names, my name doesn't lend itself to gender description well. I'm male here. Blind Seer is what the russian wolves called me. Russian being my native tounge, after that of the wolves, Blinde Serra arose from that. and I think we got somethin going here now... format:<br>
<br>
Name:<br>
Alaxander Ivanof. <br>
Nicknamed Sasha by those around him, and Blind Seer to those who know him best. <br>
<br>
Age :  26<br>
<br>
Height:  5'8&quot;<br>
<br>
Personality:  Blunt as one can be, being raised by wolves, the subtle aspects of human interaction are almost wasted no him. Solving any problem through violence and fighting is the way of the wolf. Only recently, having learned more of his human heritage has he come to understand and respect the subtle art of manipulation, intrigue, and language itself.  Like all wolves, there is a gentler more clan oriented baring to his personality. A wolf lives and dies with their pack. Rank is established through battle, then any wolf would fight to protect and help another of the pack. So it is with Blinde Serra.<br>
<br>
Physical Description:<br>
Human:  standing at 5'8&quot; with shoulder length curly silver hair, Blind Seer strikes a rather unimpressive form as a human. Lean, from a life of constant strugle for food to survive, any clothing he tends to wear hangs loosly on his body. His eyes are the purest blue, like crystals of ice. <br>
Wolf:  A large wolf would perhaps be an understatement. standing close to 4 feet at the shoulder, it is easy to tell he is not a a simple wolf. Piercing pure blue eyes, velvety soft silver fur, and whiteish nose. Sharply pointed ears adorn his head, and a plumy tail his rump. <br>
<br>
Possessions: Having lived of and for the pack, Blind Seer owns little. Clothing isn't a needed when one has fur, and weapons useless without hands. <br>
<br>
Past History:<br>
Blind Seer was raised by the wolves of Russia. Outside the city of Moscow, where winter freezes the heart of man and beast alike, Blind Seer was born. Unbenownst to him at the time, his father, a contracted werewolf, took a mate one moon filled night, and sired Blind Seer. Born with icy blue eyes, his pack did not believe he would surive, thinking he was blind. After surviving his first winter, and becoming an adult as far as the pack was concerned, he took the name Blinde Serra. After spending several more winters with his pack, whose hierarchy changed rapidly, Blinde Serra took notice of his comparitively slow aging process. While stilll seeming a pup, many of his pack had lead full lives already. After ten winters, Blinde Serra came upon his first human. A ragged begger of a man. Clad in rags, and smelling strongly of Vodka, the man attempted to kill Blinde Serra. Quickly and efficiently, Blinde Serra tore the man to shreds. Finding the taste of men discusting, he left his kill untouched beyond the wounds of its death. A mistake that would lead to his eventual exposure to the rest of humanity. A hunting party was formed after the body was found, to hunt down and kill the pack of rabid wolves. <br>
The eve that the hunters would have found the pack, resting comfortably after having finished a successful hunt, a strange jet black wolf came within the territory of Blinde Serra's pack. Now being one of the strongest of the pack, Blinde Serra, and another pack mate were sent out to meet the intruder. The wolf was enormous however. Larger than this young Blinde Serra, whom had yet to even finish growing. Non the less, the intruder humbled himself before the pair, begging in the tounge of wolves admitance into their territory with an urgent warning of danger. Blinde Serra led the stranger to the rest of the pack, where they were warned of the hunting party. The pack was easily able to escape to safety with the help of this stranger. As the jet black wolf was leaving the new territory being set up by the pack, with Blinde Serra as an escort, something remarkable occured to the young wolf's mind. The shadowy wolf next to him slowly shifted into the form of a slight human with the same shadowy hair. Stunned, and unable to think of how to respond, the human quickly knelt down next to the wolf and smiled. <br>
&quot;I have come to know you these past few days, and I believe you to be my son Blinde Serra&quot; the man spoke in wolf. &quot;You are the correct age from what little memory I have of the time. Come, let me talk with you and you decide&quot; Were the mans simple words. In the coming hours, the man described in his younger days being infected by a lycanthrope. At the time he changed with the moon, and had no memory of his actions. After many years of practice, and work, he mastered his wolf side, and was able to better control himself. Old memories also began to surface from when he was in his altered state, leading to his discovery that he had sired a son with Blinde Serra's pack.<br>
Unable to deny his differences of his pack mates, Blinde Serra took the man's word at truth, and left his pack with their blessings. Quickly through the coming years, he learned to shift into human form, then do human things, such as speak, write, and read. He also learned of his love for music. It was during this time he picked up the name Alexander. His father being Ivan gave him the name Ivanof. At the age of 25, his father imparted on him a secret. That among his family, were hunters of the unnatural. Having become one himself, his father was cast out of the family, but that did not stop him from doing what he saw as his job. He urged Alexander to leave russia and find a place in the world for himself. Blinde Serra's journey led him to America, and finally to New York.<br>
<br>
Abilities:<br>
Like most wolves, tracking is almost innate to Blind Seer. But while not in his wolf form, his tracking abilities are hampered by an inability to hear or smell as well.<br>
<br>
Able to speak and write Russian, but only able to speak English, Italian, German, and wolf.<br>
<br>
Having been raised by wolves, spoken language is still very difficult. Some of the subtleties of language, and even most words are unknown to him. <br>
<br>
Mortal. Beyond being a werewolf, Blind Seer is still mortal. Being shot, stabbed, eaten.... lethal.<br>
<br>
Silver: Severly allergic to silver. Being rubbed against unprotected skin causes a rash, being cut with it causing infection. Heaven help him if he ever eats any.<br>
<br>
Weaponry is once again a mystery to him. Having been raised to use his fangs and claws as weapons, guns, knives, swords, high yield explosives... not a clue. The basics are all there is to work with.<br>
<br>
Lycantrope infectiousness - I'm not. Clean here. Though my children will be puppies and come in litters.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=galedraeson>Gale Draeson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#8B4513>(6/4/03 7:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/GaleDreason4.jpg Width=150 Height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blinde Serra</span><hr size=1> I'm impressed, I can hardly wait to see what type of adventured you get yourself into. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blindeserra@kalaberia>Blinde Serra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8B4513>(6/5/03 9:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Blinde Serra</span><hr size=1> Thanks.
