In fact if anything it is harder for us Orthodox because we have seen the light and will be held to a higher accountability.  Orthodox also say just because you are a member of the Church, that does not guarantee anyone anything.  <br>
If one is married, and during the courtship all the woeing and so forth that went on, and then one got married, is that the end of the affair or a beginning?  If one is married to make the marriage work both commit to it everyday, otherwise the love will fade away.  It is the same with the Lord.  Do we love Him, do we commit to Him everyday?  Do we die to self, do we pick up our cross every day?  What happens if a Christian becomes a Hindu or a Muslim?  Are they still saved, even if they renounced Our Lord, in favor of a false god?<br>
In order to understand the Orthodox view of the Eucharist, one needs to understand somewhat of how we view salvation.  For us salvation is not a one time thing and we have a ticket to heaven, in truth all are saved, and it is our response that matters, are we humble and do we accept being loved and forgiven?<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Only by belonging to the Church, or in other words, being in communion with the very essence of Christ through the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, can one attain salvation unto eternal life.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
this sounds like it is saying only by belonging to the Church can one be saved.<br>
<br>
then:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Who can be regarded as a member of the Church of Christ?&quot; by saying, &quot;All those who have been properly baptized in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the true Son of God come in the flesh (1 John 4:2-3), and are united by the grace of the Sacraments - in particular the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist administered by the Priesthood of Apostolic Succession.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
and that seems to be saying you can ony belong to the Church if you are 'properply baptised'..not sure what they think that is, but if you're not baptised the way they say is proper...<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>then it seems you dont belong to the Church...so you don have salvation.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
then it says you have to believe in the Holy Eucharist administered by the Priesthood of Apostolic Succession. If you dont do that..<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>then you're not a member of the Church..so you dont have salvation.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I fit one of those 3 items i think. I believe Jesus is the true son of god in the flesh.<br>
<br>
I dont do the Eucharist that way...so I'm not a member of the Church..if i'm not a member, according to what was written earlier, I'm dont have salvation.<br>
<br>
I dont know about the baptised part..i dont know what they think is proper...but i may not have been baptised that way...if i wasnt...i'm not a member of the Church...and I dont have salvation according to this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Only by belonging to the Church...<br>

<br>
All of those quotes from Jeff came from that long post of his (#75).  Those were both quotes from Orthodox web sites, and detail doctrinal statements of the Orthodox church.<br>
<br>
I'll admit that they sound heavy handed, and taken certain ways can make you think that they are questioning the salvation of those outside their church.  Right or wrong, this isn't much different from many other denominations out there.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned, if you read all of the Catechism of the Roman Catholic church, you'd have some concerns about what they say about what salvation requires.  (At the heart they affirm that it is all God's grace, but that's another topic)  However, go to some of their other documents on ecumenism, and you will see them affirm the regenerative work of God in people in other denominations.<br>
<br>
Likewise, some Protestants do the same thing.  I have mentioned before that I attend a non-denominational church with my wife who was raised Protestant.  It came from a Brethren background and therefore espouses &quot;Believer's Baptism&quot;.  Some there question my Roman Catholic baptism as an infant.  That's their perogative, but it doesn't necessarily make it right.<br>
<br>
We have an interesting mix here at Sparrow's Hearth, and I am glad that we have perspectives from Protestants, Orthodox and Catholic.  I think communication between us all is essential and something that is, at its heart, Christian.<br>
<br>
Finally, Jeff did say this:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I never questioned anyone's salvation, I am just saying what salvation is according to Orthodoxy, and as Orthodox we have never claimed that those in other Christian bodies are hell bound.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I am inclined to believe him.  I have seen his posts on other forums, and while he is very direct, I have never seen him call into question another's salvation - unless perhaps they were a complete whacko... maybe.  Believe me, if either myself or heartjoys even remotely thinks that someone has done such a thing, they won't be around long.<br>
<br>
I know that heartjoys wants this place to be a board where Christians of all stripes can come and grow with one another.  Obviously, we are going to disagree on points, but I found the discussion in this thread to be very educational.  I, of course, have my own bias with the topic, but I am quite willing to hear the views of others.<br>
<br>
So, keep discussing and questioning.  Just remember, and this goes for all of us - me included, when we disagree, we are still talking to brothers and sisters in Christ.  Treat them as Christ would have.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
esdras<br>

Addressing the chronocological aspect of it, I think it correlates to our understanding of the Immaculate Conception.  It was a singular grace that Mary received due to the &quot;graces won&quot; of the cross {if that isn't confusing enough for those of us who believe it, imagine what some of the protestants are thinking right now!}<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>anyway..if the 'wine' actually turned to christs blood..wouldnt it then be blood and not wine? i mean taste like blood. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Wihinape</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, if you look back and read the definition of transubstantiation that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>esdras</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> provided, maybe that will shed some light.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>jeffthefinn</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The story or urban legend you recounted in post 70 got me thinking.  I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>thought</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that while it isn't the ideal, that in necessity is was ok for a Catholic to receive Holy Communion in an Orthodox Church - this would lead me to believe that we believed the same thing {ie transubstantiation} and that they're both valid.  I'll have to check into that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>i dont find God mysterious<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Winihape</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, maybe there is a difference in definition of terms.  When someone says it's a &quot;mystery of our faith&quot;, it's not that it's unknowable but something that incomprehensible to reason but only knowable by Divine Revelation.  The Trinity is a perfect example.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I believe it is inherently authoritative, and was invested with such authority as the ink dried on the page.<br>

The point that I believe <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>jeffthefinn</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is trying to make is that if St Ignatius was a student John's and he interpreted John's writing in a particular way and then you add that the Church has taught that same way for another 1400 years or so, it's something that you don't want to dismiss lightly.<br>
<br>

I remember distinctly going to Mass and sitting there talking to God about how confused I was and not knowing what to believe anymore, but when it came time for the Liturgy of the Eucharist, I knew with all my heart and soul that it was true.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have wondered when partaking of communion in a church that considers it symbolic only that if I believe that God can transform the element... would He do so?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  I don't believe in receiving communion in other churches.  For one, if we all call it communion what are we 'communing' with?  If I go to a Lutheran Church, I'm not in &quot;communion&quot; with them.  I think it sends a scandalous message.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>if you dont have a priest around then the elements dont become the body and blood. so you cant do it? so if you are in a church that doesnt believe...then its not his real blood?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Correct.  It is not.  Further as <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>esdras</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> alluded to, only priests have this faculty.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and then what about any wine or bread that is left over? does it stay his body and his blood? does it get thrown out? what do they do with it?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yes.  I can't speak for Orthodox churches, but extra consecrated bread is kept in a tabernacle to be used at another Mass or for taking Holy Communion to the sick.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>so does it being His real blood and body depend on our faith only?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> No.  If it did, you wouldn't need a priest.  Looking at it from the otherside, it's why you shouldn't be haphazard in receiving it.  An analogy would be the Bible.  It's Scripture whether we believe it or not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>think also of the sacrament of marriage....are we married then because the priest has said words over us? or is the true marriage when two people enter into a covenant with God?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  It's Catholic believe that the husband and wife confer the Sacrament.

I dont find the Trinity mysterious. It makes sense to me. I dont put alot of stock into things like Divine Revelation. Personal feelings are too strong and I think they have a big effect on what people think is from God. I see people who have prophecy that is wrong..and there has been much divine revelation to people which has cause alot of grief to people in history.<br>

To some of us, this would be understood as sanctification,  (set apart for God, holiness, a dynamic <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>process</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ) and can be found in:<br>
John 17:17,19<br>
<br>
It is referred to as being part of each believer's experience, an essential part of the past aspect of salvation (growing in God) here:<br>
Acts 20:32; 26:18; Romans 15:16; 1 Co 1:2; 6:11<br>
The Holy Spirit is the agent of sanctification.<br>
<br>
1 Th 5:23<br>
God continues to perfect the believers lives.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 10:29 and Heb 9:13 discusses the atonement of Christ's blood within the believer vs. the outward atonement of OT sacrifices.<br>

One post back a ways by the One and Only Femme made me think of something I read recently. Femme said &quot;I just can't think when Jesus said &quot;I am the Bread of Life&quot; He was saying he's a walking loaf of bread.. I think it was representational. We NEED bread to live.. we NEED Him to live.. spiritually.&quot; I believe it is indeed true that we need him to live spiritually, and that's part of the symbolism of the bread. However, we also need him to live physically! One day, those that have died in Christ are going to be resurrected with incorruptible bodies, as Christ was. I recently read an article that provided quotes from early church fathers that tied the Eucharist to our resurrection, because of not only the spiritual nourishment, but also the physical nourishment the Eucharist provides our bodies, meaning that phyiscally eating and drinking Christ's body and blood is what is at least partially makes our physical resurrection possible. However, I am unable to find that article at the moment (drat!). I think it even dealt with 1 Cor 10, in that partaking of the Eucharist is what makes the church part of Christ's body in a real, physical sense, because our bodies are nourished and thus are in a sense physically combined with his. I think the early church quotes are from Irenaeus, but I can't find them. Does anyone have any information about this? Does anyone agree/disagree? How about other passages from scripture that can maybe be talking or alluding to this?<br>

<br>
Did want to mention something along those lines, for your<br>
personal consideration.<br>
<br>
The connections between Jesus Christ our passover and the<br>
original Passover have been discussed before. (By different<br>
people throughout the years.)<br>
<br>
There were one or two observations about the original <br>
Passover that I thought were worth remembering. <br>
<br>
The passover lamb itself was a lamb of the first year, <br>
chosen from among the flock, without spot.<br>
It was offered as a sacrifice.  Its blood (on the door lintels)<br>
acted as a covering, and served as a covering for their sins.<br>
Its flesh was to be eaten before the entire nation of Israel<br>
made a run for it in the desert.   It says in Psalms that there<br>
was not one feeble person among the tribes when they set<br>
out.   It has been suggested that this shows causality,<br>
that is, that the flesh was for their physical health, ensuring <br>
they could make a major trip.  I can't guarantee it was, since<br>
I have not found a verse saying so. However, it is a <br>
possibility.  If so, that would mean the blood was for a <br>
covering for the sin on their souls, and the body was for the<br>
health of their own bodies.    When Paul addressed this,<br>
he seemed to allude to physical healing, or at least health, <br>
when he said that for not discerning the Lord's body, <br>
many had taken ill or died.  (I'll have to fetch the verses <br>
when I have a chance-I think it's in I Corinthians, but it<br>
could be in II Corinthians.)<br>
Something to think about, at least. <br>
<br>
============================================<br>
OK, found it.<br>
It was I Corinthians 11:23-34. I was referring to 11:30.<br>

<br>
&quot;Then, again, how can they say that the flesh, which is nourished with the body of the Lord and with His blood, goes to corruption, and does not partake of life?...For as the bread, which is produced from the earth, when it receives the invocation of God, is no longer common bread, but the Eucharist, consisting of two realities, earthly and heavenly; so also our bodies, when they receive the Eucharist, are no longer corruptible, having the hope of the resurrection to eternity.&quot; (Against Heresies. 4:18:5)<br>
<br>
&quot;But vain in every respect are they who despise the entire dispensation of God, and disallow the salvation of the flesh, and treat with contempt its regeneration, maintaining that it is not capable of incorruption. But if this indeed do not attain salvation, then neither did the Lord redeem us with His blood, nor is the cup of the Eucharist the communion of His blood, nor the bread which we break the communion of His body. For blood can only come from veins and flesh, and whatsoever else makes up the substance of man, such as the Word of God was actually made. By His own blood he redeemed us, as also His apostle declares, &quot;In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the remission of sins.&quot; And as we are His members, we are also nourished by means of the creation (and He Himself grants the creation to us, for He causes His sun to rise, and sends rain when He wills). He has acknowledged the cup (which is a part of the creation) as His own blood, from which He bedews our blood; and the bread (also a part of the creation) He has established as His own body, from which He gives increase to our bodies. [3] When, therefore, the mingled cup and the manufactured bread receives the Word of God, and the Eucharist of the blood and the body of Christ is made, from which things the substance of our flesh is increased and supported, how can they affirm that the flesh is incapable of receiving the gift of God, which is life eternal, which [flesh] is nourished from the body and blood of the Lord, and is a member of Him?-even as the blessed Paul declares in his Epistle to the Ephesians, that &quot;we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.&quot; He does not speak these words of some spiritual and invisible man, for a spirit has not bones nor flesh; but [he refers to] that dispensation [by which the Lord became] an actual man, consisting of flesh, and nerves, and bones,-that [flesh] which is nourished by the cup which is His blood, and receives increase from the bread which is His body. And just as a cutting from the vine planted in the ground fructifies in its season, or as a corn of wheat falling into the earth and becoming decomposed, rises with manifold increase by the Spirit of God, who contains all things, and then, through the wisdom of God, serves for the use of men, and having received the Word of God, becomes the Eucharist, which is the body and blood of Christ; so also our bodies, being nourished by it, and deposited in the earth, and suffering decomposition there, shall rise at their appointed time, the Word of God granting them resurrection to the glory of God, even the Father, who freely gives to this mortal immortality, and to this corruptible incorruption, because the strength of God is made perfect in weakness, in order that we may never become puffed up, as if we had life from ourselves, and exalted against God, our minds becoming ungrateful; but learning by experience that we possess eternal duration from the excelling power of this Being, not from our own nature, we may neither undervalue that glory which surrounds God as He is, nor be ignorant of our own nature, but that we may know what God can effect, and what benefits man receives, and thus never wander from the true comprehension of things as they are, that is, both with regard to God and with regard to man. And might it not be the case, perhaps, as I have already observed, that for this purpose God permitted our resolution into the common dust of mortality, that we, being instructed by every mode, may be accurate in all things for the future, being ignorant neither of God nor of ourselves? &quot; (&quot;Against Heresies&quot;. 5:2:2-3)<br>

There are hundreds of millions of folks walking around &quot;living&quot; today.

But I do not believe in a physical communion ie partaking of bread and wine. I believe them to be of spiritual significance under the New Covenant.<br>
