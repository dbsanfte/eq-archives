 </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tommy's 2nd Affirmative Statement</span><hr size=1> In my opening statement I stated that the Bible shows us that salvation was an ongoing event.  Paul speaks of salvation as a past event several times.  We hear in Ephesians 2:5 that “it is by grace you HAVE BEEN saved” {again, all emphasis is mine throughout) and in verse 8 “For it is by grace you HAVE BEEN saved”.  But this past aspect is only one dimension of our salvation.  There is an ongoing aspect as well.  1 Peter 1:9 states “for you are RECEIVING the goal of your faith, the SALVATION of your souls”.  Paul tells us in Philippians 2:12 that we need to “work out your own salvation”.  Along with the past and ongoing aspect of salvation there is a future aspect as well.  We find in Roman 13:11 this sense in which we have not yet received salvation “For SALVATION IS NEARER TO US NOW than when we first believed” and in 1 Corinthians 3:15 “though he himself WILL BE SAVED” and in 5:5 “that his spirit may BE SAVED in the day of the Lord Jesus”.   Salvation has past, present and future aspects.<br>
<br>
Another aspect I’d like to develop from my opening statement and from my 2nd rebuttal is the possibility of self-delusion and delusion of others.  What of the example of the “born-again” person who lives an upstanding life until the last day?  Was this person never saved, even though he and others around him would have sworn to it?  Or can one commit all kinds of foul deeds like murder, adultery, and rape and since they’re already saved, not lose it or even have to worry about it?  Or those in Matthew 7:22-23 who cry out “’Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’  Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you.  Away from me, you evildoers!’”   Sounds like a group of people who THOUGHT they were saved.  If they thought it but weren’t, that doesn’t sound like true personal moral assurance.<br>
<br>
Finally I’d like to mention more Scripture that warns us because if we’re truly personally assured, why do we need a warning for something we can’t lose?   We find in Romans 11:22 “Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provide that you CONTINUE in His kindness.  Otherwise, you also will be CUT OFF”.  And in 1 Corinthians 10:11-12 “These things happened to them as examples and were written down as WARNINGS for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come.  So, if you THINK you are standing firm, be CAREFUL that you DO NOT FALL!”   2 Timothy 2:12 tells us that “IF we ENDURE, we will also reign with Him.  IF we DISOWN Him, He will also DISOWN US;” even though in v.13 “He will remain faithful”.  EVEN though GOD is faithful, we CAN disown Him and then He will disown us!  Hebrews 6:4-6 describes sharers in the Holy Spirit who then fall away and in 10:26-27 that judgment remains for those who continue to sin after receiving the truth.<br>

<br>
(as you pointed out in Ephesians 2, “it is by grace you HAVE BEEN saved”<br>
“For it is by grace you HAVE BEEN saved”) <br>
<br>
then what is the other &quot;salvation&quot; mentioned refering to?<br>
<br>
You used Phillippians 2, but you only pulled out verse 12:<br>
<br>
&quot;So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;&quot;<br>
<br>
but you didn't go on to the next verse which give it it's context:<br>
<br>
&quot;For IT IS GOD WHO IS AT WORK IN YOU, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.&quot;<br>
<br>
Only a true child of God is going to have Him working in them! The &quot;salvation&quot; I think this is referencing is our daily walk.. NOT our eternal life. THAT is a gift from God.<br>
<br>
Of course there is an element of &quot;past&quot; &quot;present&quot; and &quot;future&quot; aspect of our salvation. We experience different parts as our life goes. We cannot recieve our glorified body until we die on this earth. But, our eternal life is already ours.<br>
<br>
I don't understand the &quot;delusion&quot; thing. Are you saying someone could actually &quot;think&quot; they were a believer and not be? How does that work with:<br>
<br>
&quot;These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God in order that you may KNOW that you have ETERNAL LIFE.<br>
~1 John 5: 13<br>
<br>
If we cannot have confidence in God's word what CAN we have confidence in? I do think there may be people &quot;playing at&quot; it.. but we determined at the beginning of the discussion that we were talking ONLY about TRUE believers. There is a separate discussion of who is/n't a &quot;true believer&quot; and we can take it up after if you want.<br>
<br>
&quot;No temptation has overtaken you but such as in common to man; and GOD IS FAITHFUL, who will NOT ALLOW you to be tempted BEYOND what you are able' but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, that you may be able to endure it.&quot;<br>
~1 Cor 10: 13<br>
<br>
TRUE believers will NOT turn from Him, nor can they be decieved.<br>
<br>
&quot;For false Christs and fasle prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to mislead, IF POSSIBLE, even the elect&quot;<br>
~ Matt 24: 24<br>
<br>
The verses in Romans 11 talking about being &quot;cut off&quot; was in reference to how the Gentiles were ever allowed into the family of God. If you read the whole chapter you see the context. The Jews turned away and salvation came to the Gentiles as a result. We were grafted in. <br>
<br>
vs 19 talks about how branches were broken off so that the Gentiles could be grafted in.. but it is by FAITH that we stand. There is a whole bit about how IF Israel turns to Him they will be grafted in again.. and vs 29 says:<br>
<br>
&quot;For the gifts and the calling of God are IRREVOCABLE.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then goes on to talk about His mercy.<br>
<br>
Hebrews 6 is relative to the parable of the seeds. These are obviously the ones that fell on shallow soil that grew up but were choked by weeds or withered with the harsh sun. The seeds NEVER TOOK ROOT. These are not true believers. <br>
<br>
Paul talks about what happens to those that knowing truth and being part of the body, that go far astray when he says in 1 Corinthians 5: 5<br>
<br>
&quot;I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.&quot;<br>
<br>
They may lose their physical life, but not their spiritual one.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=t0mmyt>T0mmyT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><img src=http://www.geocities.com/bat3193/smilies16/insanes.gif></span><br>  Posts: 643<br> <font color=#B87333>(1/13/04 6:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tommy's Second Affirmative Counterpoint</span><hr size=1> The past/present/future aspects that you are agreeing to don’t seem to explain the Scripture I quoted when you state that the present aspect means just our daily walk apart from an already obtained un-loseable salvation or the future aspect as just us obtaining a glorified body (they use phrases like ‘receiving’/’working out’ and ‘will be saved’/’may be saved’ instead of something like ‘you have salvation, just be good until you receive your glorified body in the future’).<br>
<br>
Correct - we are NOT talking about those playing at it, but surely those crying out in Matthew 7:22-23 thought they were saved and thus had apparently deluded themselves and surely anyone who experiences some growth will think they are ‘saved’ even if later they are choked by weeds or wither and die in the sun due to not taking root.  You can make that judgment that they weren’t a true believer but I’ll bet they surely felt that way, along with the those in Matthew 7 and the person who lived the exemplary life only to spend his last day committing all kinds of sins.  <br>
<br>
I agree with your context of Romans 11 but the words you choose further my point.  You talk about how the “Jews turned away” and “IF Israel turns to Him they will be grafted in again”!  Further as I already stated we are given a stern warning that WE TOO may be “CUT OFF” “[f]or if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either” v21.<br>
<br>
Finally as we both quoted 1 Corinthians 5:5 – I don’t agree that it says that they “may lose their physical life, but not their spiritual one” since the text says that they “MAY BE saved” and not ‘WILL BE’.<br>
