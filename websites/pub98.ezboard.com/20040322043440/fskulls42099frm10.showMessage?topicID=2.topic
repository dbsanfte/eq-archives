 <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:gray;font-family:courier;font-size:small;">The Moon had an eerie pale glow to it this night, almost sickly as though its own spirit was ill. A blanket of thick Darkness, A silence broken only by the occasional howl of the wolf gaurdians, had settled in Skona Ravine.<br>
 A lone tower moonlit a pale gray sat against a backdrop of utter blackness! The stone of the tower was cold, chillingly so, yet two faint voices could be heard echoing within the cold stone walls.<br>
 &quot;this task may yet prove to be in vain&quot;came a voice from a shadow in the corner. &quot;nay there be yet time...we will wait&quot; replied the second voice. Two figures cloaked in darkness neerily to be seen if at all, sat facing each other in opposing corners of the small tower.<br>
 &quot;You still have my steel dagger, Noho?&quot; asked the one.<br>
&quot; Aye&quot; quipped the other. &quot;I named it the Falcons Talon!&quot; said the first ecitedly. &quot; Aye&quot; came the Response. &quot;so can I get it back when we are finished?&quot;asked the first. &quot;Aye&quot; was the reply. The figure turned his hooded head to make eye contact with his companion &quot;Have ye nothing more to say than, Aye?&quot;He questioned. After a few moments of thoughtful silence came the response &quot;Nay&quot;.<br>
 &quot;this be our final chance to fulfill out comission, my friend&quot; spoke one. &quot;Aye.....We shall meet with success.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Noho I hear Horses, approaching&quot;. Noho listened intently for a moment &quot;Aye...Tis but one horse, a lone rider, just as we expected!&quot; Noho stood and Motioned to his friend &quot; Dark, lets be prepared, You Remember the plan? he asked.<br>
Darkillen stood, He was slighly taller than his companion yet of the same lean,muscular build. &quot;I will distract him, You will attack from behind, If your backstab is not sufficient I will finish!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Aye&quot; whispered Noho.<br>
 Moments later the galloping Rider came to a halt near the tower! He dismounted, his armor was heavy and glimmered in the moonlight.<br>
 Darkillen move to the towers far wall to peer through a small slit in the stone wall....&quot;Frak!&quot; he wispered loudly. &quot;Hush, What is it?&quot;beckoned Noho. &quot;Its a Friggin Troll...they sent a dag troll!&quot; Noho moved next to his friend to take a look.&quot; Aye, you are right he is a troll&quot; said Noho. Dark glared at him for a moment&quot; Okay now that we agree....its a troll, what do we do? We arent prepared for this&quot;.<br>
 &quot; why send a troll in full battle armor to deliver a message?&quot; asked Dark. &quot;Im not sure, unless they suspect somthing&quot; <br>
 Noho paused and cupped his left ear with his hand &quot; Riders! not far off&quot; he cried &quot; we must act now, this message cannot reach the hands of our enemies, it is critical!&quot;<br>
 The troll stood at least 9 feet tall, Midsize for a troll. He wore a complete coat of chainmail and was armed with two very large swords!<br>
 He stood with one hand on the pommel of his steed the other grasping a rolled leather bound scroll. He seemed to be slightly ill at ease in the silent darkness..........<br>
 Suddenly the silence was broken!!!<br>
A wolf howl Nearby got the messangers attention as he turned to face the sound.....Two Shining silver blades met his gaze! followed immediately by a swiftly moving Axe that dug deep into the trolls thick hide in the back just below the chainmail tunic!<br>
 The Troll bellowed in surprise and agony &quot;WAAAaaasssaaa!&quot;<br>
Blinded He grappled for his weapon and unsheathed it and began flailing wildly!<br>
 Noho deftly avoided the first of the Warrors swings, however the second was so erratic it caught him offgaurd and the tip of the blade severed his leather leggings and cut deep into his thigh! &quot;Arrrggg!&quot; he cried out as the blood began to flow from the wound. By then Darkillen had already returned his daggers to their sheathes one with an eyeball still skewered on it, and had grasped his battle axes from his back!<br>
 Dark moved silently, quickly, He manuvered from the side to the back of the troll avoiding its erraticly flailing sword! He leaped from a nearby stone and with all his strength and one swift movement he swung both axes at an angle into both sides of the Trolls neck! He could feel them sink through the vulnerable soft tissue until the blades of both axes were touching!<br>
 The Trolls helmeted head rolled off of its massive body...and both hit the ground with a loud Thud!<br>
 &quot;thatll teach ya to betray Midgard&quot; shouted Dark!<br>
Noho had already bandaged and tended to his wound as well as mix up a flesh dissolving potion that he poured over the Dead trolls decapitated head!<br>
 &quot;riders Approaching!&quot;said Dark, as he watched the liquid burn away the hide of the trolls head...leaving only the thick grey Skull! &quot; Aye..they will be dissapointed&quot; replied Noho as he tossed the Troll Skull to Dark. &quot;lets go, Ive got the scroll!&quot; said Dark as he caught the Skull and dropped it into his napsack.<br>
 The two mounted the large warrior steed and made haste, riding swiftly into the silent Darkness, Unheard, Unseen....at home!</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bskulls42099.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkillenshadowbourne>Darkillen Shadowbourne</A> at: 2/7/03 7:22:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bskulls42099.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amaravasa>Amaravasa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dread Knight</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#939393>(2/8/03 2:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fskulls42099frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Stone Tower</span><hr size=1> ::slams her beer mug on the table::<br>

&quot; Heh nah...Course not!&quot; Says Dark with a sly Grin.<br>
&quot;Another round fer Me and the Lady!&quot; says Dark as he slides a shiny coin down the bar and into the hands of the Dwarven Barkeep.<br>
&quot;That should cover the cost of the table as well, eh Friend?&quot; He nods To the Dwarf.<br>
&quot;Aye, lad...that'll do&quot; says the Dwarf as he slides two fresh mugs of ale down the bar.<br>
Dark pulls up a seat at the new table that Amara has relocated to.<br>
&quot;hmm this one seems a tad bit sturdier, eh?&quot; he says teasingly.<br>
Amara makes a gesture of dissmisal!<br>
&quot;Heh Maybe you should think of Albs as oak tables the next time we tour Thidranki&quot; He Laughs!<br>
