Her heart was racing and she felt alive.  But the village people gathered densely, and things got too crowded for her.  She decided to leave.  She didn't see Aeli, but knew he wouldn't mind if she went off by herself.<br>
<br>
Away from the noise at last, she once again indulged in the music of the sea.  This time, however, the water was far too enticing, and without realizing it, she dove in, mindless to anyone about her.  <br>
<br>
The sun was setting.  Seh floated in the water for a while to watch it.  She wondered where Aeli was now, he would want to see it, wouldn't he?<br>
<br>
She wet her hair back and washed her wings.  As she did so, she sang.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Lance.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She knew now that the Lance in the dungeon had been an illusion.  But a very convincing illusion.  Was it true she was just a lily whore?  She had loved him too--heart and soul.  Would she give up his memory so easily for Aeli?<br>
<br>
The illusioned Lance had told her he was happy to be dead, to be rid of her.  Was that true too?  She had caused him so much pain...and now she hurt Aeli even more.  <br>
<br>
It had been years, but LAnce had always remained in her mind.  He had given his love and life for her--and perished to Tryphaena.  Would he be happy that she was letting him go?  Or would he be angry?<br>
<br>
LAurena didn't realize she was crying until she could no longer see the sunset clearly.  Everything had changed when Aeli arrived.  He was brave, protecting, sincere.  Everything Lance had been.  When he had died, she...<br>
<br>
Tryphaena was dead, but her followers may still have been angry.  What if they came and killed him? The thought struck her with horror.  No, she couldn't let that happen!  <br>

Liriea walked up near Aeli, peering at the water.  &quot;Where's Phoenix? Did she go swimming?&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed.  &quot;Poor Phoenix.  She's done much for us today...and yet...I'm sad for her.&quot;  She looked guilty.  &quot;I asked her about Lance today.  That was so unsensitive.  Because then Tirea reminded me that Lance died.&quot;<br>
<br>
Liriea looked at Aeli.  &quot;Oh, you don't know Lance, do you?  He's was one of the nicest sirens I ever knew.  He was a dark siren, though.  But Laurena loved him anyway, and we were all happy.  We heard they were going to marry---but then Tryphaena killed him.  And Tiriea told me that Laurena tried to--&quot;<br>

She found Aeli on the way, and her heart grew warm again.  She smiled.  &quot;Oh, there you are.  I was wondering where you were.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly she felt that something was wrong. Aeli's eyes looked at her blankly. Her smile faded.<br>

&quot;I'm fine...really...&quot; He murmured, half pleasantly. Maybe now that he'd discovered she'd been in love with someone else, he'd be more catious, and maybe a little less affectionate. He didn't want to invade her space, so this would be the last time. <br>
<br>
Lance...who was he exactly? Aeli felt a slightly jealous pang tugging at his heart. He didn't want to loose Laurena...she was too sweet and lovely. So amazing...despite what she thought or said of herself. <p>Sekihoutai PRIDE!<br>

<br>
She looked into his eyes.  Suddenly, she didn't see her own reflection in those silver pools...she saw Lance.<br>
<br>
And she panicked.<br>
<br>
Maybe that's why she let it slip.<br>
<br>
All instincts urged her to get away, but instead she leaned against him.<br>
<br>
&quot;They told you about Lance...didn't they?&quot;  she asked softly, scared of what he might do or say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>#3 hall of fame winner</span><br>  Posts: 1263<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(7/13/03 3:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Liriea Tells All</span><hr size=1> Aeli slowly nodded, studying Laurena's face again.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry you lost him.&quot; He said sympathetically. It was sincere sympathy... he would rather Laurena be happy with someone else than be with him and not happy. Why did he  even care  about things like that, in this way?! He loved her, yes...but was he really, truly, in love with her? Honestly, he had no clue anymore.  <p>Sekihoutai PRIDE!<br>

<br>
&quot;I did love him.&quot;  She spurred herself on.  She didn't want to be lied to...so why lie?  &quot;He was the first person who ever said he loved me and meant it.  And then, he told me one day that Tryphaena had ordered him to kill me.  I felt so betrayed, but I still loved him.<br>
<br>
&quot;He died trying to save me.  Right there, in my arms.  Morbida's bite.  Tryphaena's whip.  He...died.  And all this time afterwards I thought I was alone again.  <br>
<br>
&quot;But it all changed when you came, Aeli.  You were different, and the same at once.  At first, I would look at you and see him, but now...&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked up at him and her heart melted with joy as it always did.  &quot;I look at you, and I see only you.  Because you are all I want to see.  If I were to lose you...&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena placed a gentle kiss on his forehead, but then drew away, bowing her head.  &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said.  &quot;I'm sorry if you don't understand.  I loved him.  But I love you now.&quot;  She sighed.  &quot;I know it makes no sense...you have every right to be angry.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>#3 hall of fame winner</span><br>  Posts: 1265<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(7/13/03 4:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Liriea Tells All</span><hr size=1> Aeli was a little dazzled and puzzled at the same time.
