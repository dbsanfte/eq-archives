Just say what's in your heart.  It will make a difference.)<br>
<br>
Jaci, YOU MATTER IN MY LIFE!<br>
<br>
I'll try to describe just a few of the thousands of ways you've made a difference to me.<br>
<br>
When I was a junior in high school, I tried out for Concert choir.  I didn't make the cut.  Since you had been in Concert choir for three years, I really, really wanted to also be a part of that.  Well, I was crushed, but was scheduled to go to work at Hy-Vee that evening, so off I went right after school.<br>
<br>
While I was there, you came home for the week end from St. Catherine's.  Maybe it was mom who told you, but you came to the grocery store where I was working and found me and opening your arms wide, you gave me a big, loving hug.  <br>
<br>
I can remember burying my face in your shoulder and crying.  How wonderful to have a sister! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
And I've always been genuinely thankful that I wasn't the first daughter.  You did a great job of breaking in our parents, so that when I did some of the same mischievous antics, I got away with it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    The folks knew from experience that I would be okay, since you were okay.<br>
<br>
I remember a time when Heidi was arguing with you.  You didn't yell, you didn't threaten, you held your ground and firmly said, &quot;no.&quot;  I filed that lesson away in the top drawer of my brain, knowing that I'd need to copy your loving, yet firm attitude myself.  <br>
<br>
I feel so lucky that I've been able to watch you parent your kids and then see how incredible they are!!  I know your methods work, the proof is in front of my eyes.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes, you've made me mad.  When you &quot;borrowed&quot; my favorite sweater and wore it for Christmas.  When you left the bathroom sink a mess with toothpaste gobs and splashed water on the counter when we were teens together.  When you wouldn't give me a ride home from some concert:  We were both in college and I had gone with friends to a concert in downtown St. Paul.  The buses had stopped running and I called you for a ride.  You wouldn't get me, but put bit of tough love into action.  I appreciate that because it helped me to realize that I needed to take care of myself and not be a victim who needs rescuing.  <br>
<br>
But these times, too, have helped to make my life richer and fuller.  You challenged me and you've loved me and you've made an indelible mark on my life.  More than a mark, Jaci, you've helped to shape me into who I am now.  <br>
<br>
And now you are showing me how to cope with the ultimate adversity.  I watch you do this with faith and dignity.  I see a strong woman who takes the lead, who is not a victim, but the victor.  While your body is weak and, in fact, weakens more each day, your spirit is strong.  It soars above all of these trials.  Despite fears you have, you continue to be in charge of yourself.  <br>
<br>
When my turn comes, as it will to us all, I hope to follow your example, dear sister, my beloved.<br>
<br>

<br>
In describing my childhood, I've often said it was more like I had 5 parents instead of 2.  My relationship with you has always been one of admiration, education, and love.  I remember turning to you as a child for your consistent loving temperment.  I could always count on you to be level-headed and affectionate.  You increased the stability and security of my childhood. You also made one tough act to follow.  Growing up through the Owatonna school system, teachers would remark, &quot;oh, you're another one of the Budig girls&quot; not with a shake of their head but with expectations in their eyes.  I followed in the footsteps of sisters who were musically gifted, popular, known for hard work, respectability, and kindness.  I loved being another one of the Budig girls because I admired my older sisters so much.  I still do!<br>
<br>
You did so many of the &quot;firsts&quot; in our family and always set the bar high.  You married first and chose a kind, loving, committed, witty and hard-working man.  You had the first grandchild and I'll never forget hearing mom yelling out the front door to a friend on a warm summer day, &quot;I'm a grandma!&quot;  When I heard that, I felt you'd opened up yet another horizon of possibility.  I admired the consistent and strong love you showed Sam and Heidi.  And I've delighted in watching them grow up to be such compassionate, intelligent, self-reliant, and fun-loving young adults.  The legacy of your love will perpetuate itself through them and all of us whom you've touched.<br>
<br>
You've given me long-lasting and important gifts.  You've been my role model and continue to be so.  With awe I've watched you negotiate the past 4 months, keeping your cool and continuing to love those around you.  I'm amazed.  Despite the intensely personal and difficult experience you are going through, you remain engaged, loving, and reliable.  How will I ever measure up to how you handle this milestone in your life?  Goodness and love just radiates from you as it always has.<br>
<br>
I love you, Jaci.  You make my life richer.  I'm so very grateful.<br>
