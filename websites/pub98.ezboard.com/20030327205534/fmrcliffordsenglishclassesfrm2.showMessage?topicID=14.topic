When the book was written, reconstruction was hitting some hard times. Although slavery was a long time gone, Jim Crow laws were enforced to allow blacks into society, but limit their powers immensely. Mark Twain used slavery in Huck Finn because the new racism in the south was much harder to criticize. There were similarities between what was happening during slavery and what was going on during reconstruction.<br>
        Education is another important theme in the book. Twain takes an interesting standpoint, he seems to be conveying the point that there is a difference between being educated and being intelligent. It is also apparent that education is not always a good thing, it really is how you use it that matters. People that are uneducated aren't always stupid.<br>

Urgo's posting</span><hr size=1>        Slavery is a theme shone in our book. Other themes can be explored in the book also. One theme that I am looking at is independence. Independence is explored throughout the novel. Huck is striving to accomplish independence from school, Pap and other things in life. Jim is another example of independence and his is trying to achieve it also. The scene in the book that shows an example of independence is when Jim runs away in the middle of the night to gain independence. From then on Jim is gaining more and more independence every day. Huck also feels more and more independent. Huck gains his independence when he runs away from Pap and makes everyone believe that he is dead.<br>

You have a good point when you say that uneducated people aren’t necessarily stupid. The book does show that this is true. The book shows an example of this because Jim doesn’t really seem dumb because he has a good intellectual sense of the world. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tcliffdawg>tcliffdawg</A> at: 2/7/03 1:20:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cgriffith>CGriffith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/6/03 8:19:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Courtney's Reply</span><hr size=1> There are many themes in the book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, however I feel education is one of the main ones.  Some of the people gained education through school, and others learned how to be street smart.  Tom is the leader of the gang because he reads more than the others boys; therefore, they look up to him.  Huck is not very book smart and he misinterprets many incidences that occur, however, Huck is very street smart.  He can make up stories as he is going along, and people will believe him.  Even though Jim did not get a formal education, he is also street smart.  Sometimes it takes him a while to understand things, but other times he catches on quick.  When Huck played the joke on him, he believed Huck until he saw the branches in his canoe.  Education is very important to some of the characters or else they would not be the leader of a gang or not be able to convince people and then wind up in a worst situation. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cgriffith>CGriffith</A> at: 2/6/03 8:20:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thomsonb3h@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>thomsonb3h</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/6/03 8:20:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Themes in Huck Finn</span><hr size=1> one theme in the book is education. Twain uses the theme of education to show that people during this time were not very educated. He uses the example of the feud between the Sheperdons and the Grangerford to show that nobody, during this time, was educated. Both families were very well known and wealthy making them at the top of the classes. Twain shows that even the highest of social status were still uneducated. He explains this by showing the feud between the two families and telling us that neighter of them know why they are killing one another but they have been for over forty years. This shows that people were supid at the time. If the highest of classes are doing things of this sort, what does that say about the rest of the people during this time? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thomsonb3h@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>thomsonb3h</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/6/03 8:34:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re:reply to ashley's posting</span><hr size=1> I agree with Ashley that Indenpendence is another theme of the book. It's obvious that this is what Huck is looking for when he ran away from pap because if he were not he could have gone back to the widdow and been taken care of. Being that Jim is a slave I believe that he and all other slave are striving for Indenpendence because they have been property their entire lives. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarahcercone@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>SarahCercone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/6/03 8:49:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Themes in Huck Finn</span><hr size=1> I believe that aside from the issues of racism presented in Huck Finn, Mark Twain wrote this novel to depict the importance and value of education.  There are many instances and dialog between characters in the novel which show how one's level of education can impact one's entire view of the world.  For example, on page 79, Jim and Huck get into an arguement about whether frenchmen have a right to speak differently than Americans.  Huck attempts to explain to Jim that frenchmen simply speak differently because it is only natural for humans to have differing speech, but Jim refuses to accept this, saying that &quot;if he's a man, why don't he TALK like us men!&quot;  This conversation in the novel shows the distinct difference between someone educated, and someone uneducated.  <br>
<br>
Huck has gone to school and been educated, and understands that people in different parts of the world speak in different dialects.  Jim, on the other hand, has never been to school, and he has never learned that even though different languages are spoken throughout the world, all languages express the same ideas and feelings in conversation.  It is clearly shown how lack of education has made Jim ignorant about the world, even though he may be entirely capable of being intellectual with the proper schooling.  This is only one specific instance in the novel which shows the distinction between education level among the characters, but I believe that Mark Twain uses these such scenes to depict the value of education to our everyday lives.  I think that spreading awareness to America about the importance of education was one of Twain's main purposes in writing Huck Finn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lambertd3@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>lambertd3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/6/03 10:31:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Daryl's Spheres of Influence</span><hr size=1>     Mark Twain is definately an inciteful writer, and he really put a lot of effort into writing this book from what I have heard. For this reason I am pretty sure that he did not write this book just to entertain dim-witted people. I believe that Twain could have been writing about the importance &quot;good parenting&quot; and children having positive influences in their lives. Througout the novel Huck is influenced by many different people and their ideas. When Huck was living with the widow Douglas he soon became acclamated to her civilized lifestyle. When Huck was taken to live across the river with Pap he soon settled in and became comfortable there as well.<br>
      Huck is not a racist but his Father and the other influences in Huck's community have instilled racist ideals in Huck that he views as right. For example, He almost turned Jim in to the slave hunters because the racist influences were almost second nature him and he realized  how morally wrong it was to aid a runaway slave. But, Jim was his friend and he was able to resist  everything that he was taught to be right. <br>
   With good parenting, like that of the widow, Huck could have become an educated person and become more apt to earn an honest living. Spheres of influence are very important especially children with there malleable minds, so Twain could have been promoting positive influences and good parenting in his novel.<br>

At the beginning of the book, Huck distrusts the morals of a society that fails to protect him from abuse. This causes skepticism of society in Huck and coupled with his growing relationship with Jim, leads Huck to question many of the teachings he has received on race. Huck denounces what has been taught to be proper and bases his decisions on his experiences, his own sense of logic, and what his developing conscience tells him. While Huck is on the raft, away from civilization, he comes to his own conclusions through deep introspection and chooses his own moral path instead of the accepted norms of Southern culture. Thus far in the book, we can see Huck learning to read the world around him like the books he has read in school; he is able to distinguish for himself between good and bad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crouchm4@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>CrouchM4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/6/03 10:38:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Themes in Huck Finn</span><hr size=1> I see Honesty playing a significant role and theme in the Mark Twain’s compelling novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  Throughout the novel, many of our characters deceive others and lie.  Huck and Jim are living lies! I think it is Honesty is important themes in this book because we are constantly witnessing the characters deliberately misguide others and we can see firsthand the mind-boggling effects it can have on individuals.  One specific scene that I think portrays how dishonest Huck and Jim are is when they meet the King and the Duke.  They are not honest about their pasts or about their reasons and intentions for their running away.  They try to convince the king and the Duke that Jim was Huck’s family’s slave.  Them the two cons try to convince Huck and Jim that they are Kings and Dukes! Lies! Lies! Lies!  I feel like most of this book has been about how the characters have not been truthful and have gotten themselves into a great deal of trouble.  They are constantly trying to get themselves out of situations that their mistruths have led them into.  I think an important message in this book is that honesty is extremely important and that you cannot always believe what people say! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lambertd3@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>lambertd3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/6/03 10:42:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ReDaryl's reply to Btom</span><hr size=1>   I agree with you that there were not many educated people during this time.Although, I disagree that there were NOT any educated people during this time.Just look at Duke and King, They come up with some pretty good cons.

In the beginning Huck plays many jokes on Jim. He puts a snake in Jim’s sleeping bag, causes Jim to get bitten by a snake, and messes with his mind telling him false things. After Jim expresses that he doesn’t appreciate Huck’s messing with him, Huck apologizes and asks for forgiveness, which he had never done before. At that point, Huck’s actions showed that he realized his mistakes and was thinking of Jim as a kind human being, not as his slave. Huck begins to gradually grow up and act more mature that he did before he ran away with Jim.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tcliffdawg>tcliffdawg</A> at: 2/7/03 1:27:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=timms3@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>Timms3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/7/03 2:31:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Themes in Huck Finn</span><hr size=1> I feel that one of the main themes that Twain is trying to express in his book is that even twenty years after the Civil War, there was still a major problem with racism. Twain wanted readers to realize that black people were not treated much differently even after the war. This is vividly depicted when Pap says that he would not vote because black people were allowed to in their state. Many people in the 1880’s still thought that black people should not be allowed to vote and were prevented to do so by things such as Jim Crow laws. Twain was subtlety trying to show readers that black people were just like white people by describing what Jim was thinking. This was probably the first time many white people at this time were shown that black people had feelings just like they did. Twain wanted to open racist white people’s eyes with this book.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battey4>Battey4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/7/03 2:41:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Reply</span><hr size=1> I believe that MeullerD, brings up a very good point in slavery. Although slavery in this book may be seen in two different lights. The main point that I would have to see would be breaking inter-racial lines. Even though many of the characters in Huck Finn are racist, Huck is not. Many might say that Huck is in fact racist because he drops N-bombs. But that was the trend of the time. If someone was to say that now most definatley someone would be offended. But Huck was just a product of the society he grew up in. The reason that I don't think Huck is a racist is because he in fact befriends Jim and treats him in the same way that he would treat anyone else. Stupid is a stupid does.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=timms3@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>Timms3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/7/03 2:44:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A.

His main characters, Jim and Huck, are both trying to gain their independence thoughout this novel. I think Twain is trying to make a point that being independent makes a person stronger because they will think for themselves.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=timms3@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>Timms3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/7/03 2:52:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Daryl's Spheres of Influence</span><hr size=1> I think Daryl makes a good point that Twain was expressing that children are easily influenced, so they should be influenced by good people or not at all if possible. Twain shows that a person's child will have many of the same ideas as their parents and their community. This is shown by Huck living with the widow and then with his father. These two people are very different, but Twain shows how Huck is able to adapt to each one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=christiansons@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>christiansons</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/7/03 9:04:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   sacha's reply</span><hr size=1> I think Twain communicates the ideas of equality and tolerance for all people in Huck Finn.  Even after the civil War once blacks were free from slavery they still didn't have equal rights. Blacks were segregated and weren't given the same rights as white men.  Twain tries to show that out of everyone Huck is the only one that can bridge the gap and interact with a black man, Jim, on the same level. In the beginning of the book Huck won't apologize to a black man.  After living with Jim and realizing that Jim has feelings and emotions just like white men Huck starts to befriend him and not think of him as just a slave but as a man.  At one point in the book after lying to Jim, Huck sees that he has really hurt Jim's feelings and is willing to bend down and kiss his feet.  Huck feels connected to Jim and protects him as he runs for freedom.  Huck is able to brake the color barrier and not look at Jim as black or white but as a friend. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCC99><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=christiansons@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>christiansons</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/7/03 9:20:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Daryl's Spheres of Influence</span><hr size=1> I agree with Daryl, I think Twain was trying to show that good parenting is extremely important to the growth and maturing of children.  The adult children grow up to be is greatly influenced by their parents values and ideas as well as the environment around the child.  Huck could have grown up quite differently depending of what path he chose, and like Daryl I think Twain wanted to show the reader how much huck was influenced by his surroundings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00CC00><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmrcliffordsenglishclasses.showUserPublicProfile?gid=christiansons@mrcliffordsenglishclasses>christiansons</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00CC00>(2/7/03 9:36:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fmrcliffordsenglishclassesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Reply</span><hr size=1> I agree with Danny on his view point of education.
