Notes: Ok been meaning to write another fic for like ages and this idea suddenly popped into my head out of nowhere.  <br>
Warning: I'm not the best writer and I know that, but I try my best <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Alius Tempus<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper, not helping!&quot; complained an exasperated Trance.<br>
<br>
For past two hours her and Harper had been traipsing along a barren rock plateau in search of a village that had issued a distress call.  Only one problem.  There was no village to be found.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm I recall saying 'I don't think this is a good idea' but does anyone listen to me?  Of course not!  I'm just Seamus Harper, genius extraordinary, here to save your butts from another mess you create!  'Hey Harper come on this mission, you've been moaning about wanting to go to a planet for ages now,' Not what I had in mind thank you very much!&quot; Harper exclaimed, mostly to the wind as Trance was fed up of him.<br>
<br>
Squinting up at the blazing sun that was climbing higher into the sky with each passing minute, Harper sighed, and continued to drag his blistering feet through the dirt, cursing as he tripped over another rock.<br>
<br>
About 10 meters ahead of him, Trance pushed on.  Gazing towards the horizon, she could see that there was nothing for miles.  No cover or settlements.  Nothing.  It was already ninety degrees and the sun wasn't even fully up.  <br>
<br>
&quot;There has to be something here!  Distress calls don't come from nothing.&quot;  Thought a puzzled Trance.<br>
<br>
Two hours ago, Beka had dropped them off 2Km from where the village was seen on sensors, telling them that they would pick up them up in 3 days time as there were supplies to get and Andromeda was tending to something the Sabre Jaguar pride was pouting about.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Oww! Sonofa...!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Trance sighed. <br>
<br>
&quot;What now Harper?&quot; she replied turning around slowly to face him with an angry glint in her eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just a stupid bug...its nothing!&quot; He answered quickly with he saw her angry melt quickly and change to worry.<br>
<br>
Sighing again for what seemed the fortieth time, Harper marched onwards.  Dressed only in a sleeveless t-shirt and trousers didn't seem to do anything to help in trying to cool down from the heat scorching his skin.  Changing shoulders on his backpack didn't help either, the straps cutting into his skin like knifes, the sweat acting like acid, making the pain worse.<br>
<br>
&quot;Could things be any more bad?&quot;  Harper questioned mentally to himself.<br>
<br>
Suddenly in front of him, Trance stopped dead in her tracks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Umm Harper, do you feel that?&quot; she asked anxiously.<br>
&quot;Feel what?&quot; he replied with a puzzled frown creasing his forehead.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know, just little vib...&quot; she retorted but was cut off as herself and Harper were thrown to the ground as an ear splitting roar erupted around them and the ground was ripped away from under them.<br>
<br>
Dust rose and engulfed the fallen pair like the hands of some horror monster only seen in movies.  Rocks fell from the sky like sadistic rain drops, battering the coughing soles on the ground.<br>
<br>
Tremor after tremor convulsed through the rock like it was made of jelly.  Crevasses yawned out like slashes being cut into the ground by some omnipotent torturer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trance!&quot;  Harper screamed till his throat was raw, dust clogged his lungs, burned his eyes and rocks hailing down upon him, assaulting his body. <br>
<br>
In return, all that could be seen was glimpses of gold and screams heard in the contorting wall of dust.  Then it stopped.<br>
<br>
Below him, he could feel the surface disintegrate into rubble.  He knew it was going to collapse any moment and he'd fall to his death but no matter how he tried, every little movement caused searing hot pain to shoot through his body and screams of agony to burst forth from his mouth.<br>
<br>
But it was too late.  There was nothing below him now. Falling, nothing to stop him, falling till blissful darkness encompassed him.<br>
<br>
TBC...<br>

<br>
Fingers of rock protruded from the surface reaching for the heavens, all the while trying to escape their dark kingdom.  Whereas others plunged down into the darkness of oblivion, reaching further than the eye could see into the fireball core of this desolate rock.  <br>
<br>
For miles, dust swirled majestically through the scorched dry air, taking the form of dancing apparitions skipping round the three witches' cauldron.  The cauldron in this case being two souls lying still, no shiver or twitch, on the barren earth, red and gold spreading outwards from them...<br>
<br>
          <br>
            <br>
*************<br>
       <br>
<br>
          <br>
          <br>
Darkness encompassed Trance's mind.  The feeling loneliness engulfed her, but a feeling of floating brought peace and put to rest her fears.  <br>
<br>
However, a small speck of light was growing and expanding to her right, although she couldn't really tell, as she had no feeling of what was up or down.  The light grew in radiance, expanding in every direction, then stopped.  She tried to move, do something, but nothing worked.  The light sat like it was taunting and ridiculing her.  She stared back into its blinding depths.  All of a sudden, it turned crimson, taking the form of a figure.  Black hole eyes took shape where its head would be.  Trance could do nothing, frozen in ice-cold fear that clung and grasped at her.  She stared into her nemesis's eyes.  Then the demon reached a blood stained hand out towards her, placing it upon her forehead.  Agonizing pain coursed through every sense she had, torturing every fibre of her being, screaming till her throat was raw, but it wouldn't stop...<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
She bolted up right, gasping painful raw breaths, and a terrified scream dieing in her throat.  Eyes darted around looking for any sign of Him, but all that greeted her was a dead landscape.  Sighing in relief and while trying to calm her breathing, 'I hate it when I die,' she mused to herself.<br>
<br>
Then she remembered how she got into the predicament, and terror slammed into her once again.  Memories of being thrown through the air like one of Harper's empty cola cans assaulted her mind.<br>
<br>
Trance's breathing stop.  Harper.  There was no sight or sounds from him.  And when that happened, it was never a good sign.<br>
<br>
&quot;Harper?!&quot; she called out, her voice cracking as it felt like someone had taken a nano-wielder to her throat.<br>
<br>
Trance waited anxiously but the only reply was silence.  'I never liked silence, usually means something bad is going to happen,' she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Seeing there was no other option but to look for him - perhaps a gruesome task depending on what she found - she checked herself over.  Considering what she had been through, she was quite amazed to find only scrapes and bumps.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Trance slowly got to her feet, her back groaning a little in protest to the movement.  Once up, she got a better look at her new surroundings.  The once flat endless plain was now full of jagged cliffs and gaping holes, and boulders littered the ground.  Tiny particles of dirt blowing in the strengthen wind felt like tiny but painful bites against her face and bare arms.<br>
<br>
Looking around, there was no sign of Harper.  To her left there was a large gathering of rocks, ranging in sizes.  Glancing to that area, a knot grew heavy in her stomach and she had a strong feeling that she'd unfortunately find Harper there.<br>
<br>
Slowly moving towards that area, her instincts grew stronger within her.  Bracing herself she took the final steps towards her destination.  Looking down, there was a dribble of blood at her foot.  Lifting her eyes a bit, there he was.  <br>
<br>
Trance's eyes grew wide and a hand shot to her mouth as she gasped, trying hard to keep the nausea that threatened to overcome her, at bay.  Looking down at Harper, she knew in her heart that there was no way he could have survived.<br>
              <br>
