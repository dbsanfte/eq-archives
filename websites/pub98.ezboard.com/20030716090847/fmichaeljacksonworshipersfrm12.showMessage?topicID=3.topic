Chapter 2<br>
Damage Report<br>
<br>
“How bad is it?” Michael asked with anger growing in his voice, he was eyeing the doctor with hatred.<br>
“Nila is stabilized for right now, but we can’t guarantee that she can recover fully from this.” Dr. Carter said being realistic.<br>
“What?!?!” Michael said breaking down in tears again in front of every one in the waiting area.<br>
“She might die, Mr. Jackson” Dr. Carter softly.<br>
Michael just cried and cried, Dr. Carter asked him if he would like to see me. Michael said no, he isn’t very good with hospitals, not since Janet was sick. Michael pulled himself together and asked what other injuries there were.<br>
“Well there are multiple head blows causing some trauma, some rib fractures, there was some internal bleeding, and she has a collapsed lung. We had to help her breaths, she is doing fine right now, but she will have to stay here for quite sometime.” Dr. Carter explained.<br>
“Okay, Thank you.” Michael said teary-eyed.<br>
He pulled himself together again and got back into the limo. He drove back to our house, 1254 Lakeshore Dr. (that’s really where I live <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and went inside.<br>
“How is she?” Mother asked sitting next to Joseph who was reading his paper. He was somewhat saddened.<br>
”She is okay for now. Oh Mother I can’t loose her.” Michael sobbed into his mother’s lap. She stroked his short hair, and talked to him about hard times.<br>
“Michael quit crying.” Joseph said being ignorant, “She’ll live”<br>
“Joseph!” Mother said looking at him.<br>
Joseph got up and went into the library to read his paper in peace. Michael continued to cry in his mother’s lap. Randy came in with Rachel on his back, he was giving her a piggy back ride.<br>
“Uncle Randy, what’s wrong with Daddy?” Rachel asked climbing off of Randy’s back.<br>
“He’s upset.” Mother said giving her step-granddaughter a hug. Rachel sat on the floor next to Michael. She put his arm around her and rocked with him. He continued to cry.<br>
“Mommy is in the hospital and she is going to be there for a while.” Michael said trying to cheer up for Rachel.<br>
“Will she be okay?” Rachel asked.<br>
Michael tried to be optimistic but he couldn’t and broke down again. Rachel sat next to her stepfather hugging him trying to make him feel better. Michael looked at Randy and told him to call Marlon, Jermaine and Tito. Janet was on tour: Velvet Rope. REbbie was in the Bahamas and Latoya was let’s forget about her. Around 8pm Michael was in our bedroom with Tito and his door was locked.<br>
“Mikey, look, I know your wifey is illin’ but you cant stop doin’ whatchu doin’” Tito said with hie perfect ghetto lingo.<br>
“I can’t go on! I need her! She’s always been there for me. That’s why I love her!” Michael said angrily. He’s angry with God right now for making this happen. Michael balled up his first looking out the window with so much anger. Tito looked at his younger brother and remembered how it felt when he lost Didi after being with her for so long. <br>
“Look, Michael, you gotta tell yourself that she will make it.” He said coming over to give his brother a hug. Michael pushed him away. He came back over and sat on the bed.<br>
“Tito, she has been with me ever since I released Dangerous. I love her so much, if I loose her-” Michael started but stopped, “I should have asked her to come home early.”<br>
“Dude, that wouldn’t have changed anything. She still would have been in an accident. Things happen for a reason.” Tito said.<br>
“But why did this happen?!” Michael cried, breaking into tears again, “Why?!” <br>
Michael sobbed into a pillow, until Tito came over and took it from him. They rocked back and forth in a sorrowful embrace.<br>
<br>
Nila’s Point of View<br>
I would’ve still gotten in the crash Michael, regardless what time I left. Don’t cry and don’t be angry with God. He will help me through this. Believe me and trust in Him<br>
End of View<br>
.<br>
“Look, I need to go to sleep now. I have been drained-” Michael started.<br>
“I know, Happy 38th Birthday bro, I love you” Tito said unlocking the door.<br>
“I love you too.” Michael said laying down on the bed.<br>
Nancy was in the kitchen, trying to make something light so everyone could calm down, the accident has everyone worked up. Nancy told Rachel that she had to eat her veggies in order to get a cookie.<br>
“The things I do for a cookie.” She said out loud, “Uncle Randy eat these.”<br>
“Nope sorry sweetie pie.” He said eating his own food.<br>
Afterwards she took a bath, she laid down in her bed and drifted to sleep. She started to dream about me.<br>
“Mommy?” Rachel asked, “Is that you?”<br>
I was wearing a white silk dress. I had a heavenly glow about me, like I had just died or something.<br>
“Yes, it’s me.” I answered trying to reach her tiny hands.<br>
“I can’t reach you Mommy!” Rachel said trying her best, “Mommy!”<br>
The next thing we knew the scenery changed, instead of it being top of clouds it was the scene of the accident, and I disappeared. I couldn’t see Rachel anymore, all I could see was the paramedic guys trying to stabilize me. I was reliving the accident and the pain all over again with my daughter on the side lines watching. There was a loud banging noise and Rachel was gone, she woke up.<br>
“Daddy!” Rachel screamed running out her room, “Daddy!”<br>
Michael heard her scream and unlocked his door, he sat down on the bed and waited for her to come in.<br>
“Rachel honey what’s wrong?” Michael asked as he hugged her.<br>
“I had a bad dream about Mommy..”Rachel sobbed uncontrollably in his armds.<br>
“It’s okay. You can sleep in here with me.” Michael said tucking her in on Nila’s side of the bed.<br>
“I saw her in white then it looked like the car crash.” Rachel said drowsily.<br>
“Don’t worry sweetie. It’s okay now.” Michael said laying back down.<br>
In the morning Michael didn’t even come to get breakfast, Nancy had brought a tray up to his room to find him still sleeping heavily. She placed the tray on the bench before the bed and walked our quietly, closing the door behind her. <br>
The damage has been done….<br>
