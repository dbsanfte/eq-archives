<br>
Age: Unknown (Appears 24) *See history* <br>
<br>
Sex: Male <br>
<br>
Mortality: Vampire <br>
Appearance: Stands 5'10&quot; tall at about 195lbs in weight. He has blue eyes, sandy brown hair. His build is lean and muscular, no chest hair. He has rings on his fingers and one thin gold neckless around his neck. Zack can usually be seen wearing blue jeans, muscle shirt and a jacket. <br>
<br>
Personality: Zack is a trouble maker, a tough n rough neck. Never one to back down from a fight, he acts like he has no cares in the world. He always has a deep searching look in his eyes, his lips sealed in a thin line but he is a big sweet heart deep down with a smile that has charmed the ladies into a swoon. His thick French Canadian accent is a charmer as well for him, and he refuses to lose it. Though he acts tough, he has a lot of respect for woman and will never hit one even in self defense. You'll even see him opening doors for them but if you laugh, you'll be eating your teeth. Deep inside his cold exterior dwells a romantic soul that is just seeking companionship. <br>
<br>
Weapons: Zack carries about a switchblade most of the time but he does have a few guns. His favorite is his Magnum. <br>
<br>
Skills <br>
<br>
<br>
Physical Skills: <br>
Zack is a street fighter, tough as nails and very quick. Never one for clean fighting, Zack will use any trick in the book. He is well known and respected for his bar room fights having never lost one yet. Because he is a vampire, Zack has incredible amounts of endless strength (see history for more) and it all comes in handy, making his punches and kicks very deadly and bone breaking. Martial arts is something he knows very well though he has mixed the styles to suit his own. Most often however he kickboxes. Often to his movements appear as a blur to mortals, only quick vampires can track him with ease. <br>
<br>
Body Mending: Zack has developed his body to the point were he can heal from all minor wounds rather quickly. He can recover from a simple gunshot wound and other injuries as well. But more deadly wounds can land him in the hospital. <br>
<br>
Just to note, it takes a large amount of beer for him to become drunk and drugs do not effect him much at all. <br>
<br>
Mental Skills: <br>
<br>
Deception: Zack can make himself appear to have vanished in the sight of mortals and vampires and move freely in their midst. This is a mind/eye trick only a few vampires can see through and usually if they can see him, its not clear. <br>
<br>
Minds Window: Zack can read other's thoughts as well as project his hown into theirs. His mental shielding is very strong as well but can be broken by powerful vampires. <br>
<br>
The Break Down: Zack's dirty fighting is not limited to his physical skills. One of his favorite tricks is to trick people into thinking they are feeling more pain then in reality they are. For example he punches them in the ribs, then tricks their mind into believing their ribs are broken. This of course causes them to freak right out with some hilarious results for Zack to watch. <br>
<br>
Weaknesses <br>
<br>
<br>
Since Zack is a vampire, daylight is probably his biggest weakness. If he steps out in direct sunlight he will roast on the spot and die if he can not get back inside. If he puts on the strongest sunblock, he can remain outside in the day light for a few hours but only in the morning and late afternoon. Usually Zack just sleeps away the day. Zack can also be seriously hurt and even killed by bullets if the wounds are large and multiple, also the decapitation of his head does the trick as well. <br>
<br>
Another weakness is that when Zack sleeps, not even an earthquake can wake him up, making him very vulnerable. This does not happen every time he sleeps, but its hard to tell for sure if he is in that deep of slumber or not. Zack is also ticklish if that counts. <br>
<br>
Mortal illnesses hardly effect Zack but if he does come down with one, it usually means trouble and could last months on end. One winter Zack came down with a cold and nearly died from it. <br>
<br>
History: <br>
<br>
Zack was born on a farm in Ontario Canada near the Quebec border about the turn of the century (1900 A.D.) to a John MacTavish and his wife Betty. When WW1 started in 1914, Zack was just into his teens. To young to enlist, he stood by as his father and older brothers went off to fight. This left him alone with the farm and his mother and sisters. His father never returned from the war and neither did his brothers save one. <br>
<br>
When Zack was twenty four years old, he went on a trip to the big city of Ottawa with some of his friends. He was tired of the farm and wanted adventure and when he heard about the great opportunities in Montreal Quebec, Zack decided to go there. One night in a bar though he picked a fight with the wrong guy who beat him nearly to death but Zack refused to give up cause he never losses. The man dragged him out back to clean him up but to Zack's misfortune and descovery, it turned out the man was a vampire. <br>
<br>
Zack was sired at twenty four years old by an ancient vampire who saw great potential in the hot headed lad from Ontario and trained him in mind skills as well as to discover his physical potental as well. He taught Zack everything he knew, and fed him of his ancient powerful blood till it was time to part ways. Zack knew he could not return home like this so he stayed in Montreal for a while. However still seeking adventure, Zack decided to travel around the country. Bidding his family goodbye, he left for good. Though it tore his heart, it was for the best for they could not know about what he had become. <br>
<br>
Eventually his travels led him to the US and on to NY. World War II had come and gone, as had Vietnam but Zack never bothered to join up in either of them. War held no interest to him and he had no wish to die. <br>
<br>
NY was a huge place and Zack soon found a job and other activities to make money on the side. He now owns a nice appartment in the down town area, drives a sleek looking black Corvette as well as a Honda street bike. He is actually more well off then he looks and is usually a hit at the bars and clubs. His job is in business administration in a fast growing company, his fire and desire to succeed makes him very successful. Good with computers and people, Zack is the talk of many businesses. Currently Zack is single, and he pays little to no attention to the other vampires in NY. He has no interest in their games and treats them all like he treats the mortals. <br>
<br>
Still carrying his thick canadian accent and sporting his &quot;can't stop me&quot; additude, there is no telling were Zack is bound to end up one day. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zackmactavish>Zack MacTavish</A> at: 8/30/03 9:10 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showPrevMessage?topicID=20.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showNextMessage?topicID=20.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.emailToFriend?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.threadControl?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="kalaberiafrm36">Mortal and Kindred Laws<option value="kalaberiafrm37">Character Biographies<option value="kalaberiafrm38">Character Plotting<option value="kalaberiafrm45">Times Square<option value="kalaberiafrm40">Central Park<option value="kalaberiafrm41">Stanton Isle<option value="kalaberiafrm42">Abandoned Subway<option value="kalaberiafrm43">Chitter Chatter<option value="kalaberiafrm44">Advertisements <option value="kalaberiafrm46">Admin and mods<option value="kalaberiafrm47">Warehouse District</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8B4513>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia>MidnyghtRising</a><font color=#8B4513> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37>Character Biographies</a> <font color=#8B4513> - </font><br><br> <a href=http://www.runesofdesire.com><img src=http://runesofdesire.com/rod6.jpg></a><br><br>
