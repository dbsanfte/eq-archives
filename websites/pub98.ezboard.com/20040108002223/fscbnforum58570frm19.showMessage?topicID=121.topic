The continuation) Several days passed as Arman dealt with his anguish and battled tirelessly against his beast, which stayed as close to the surface as possible. It was sheer luck that the two retainers escaped with their lives that evening. One suffered some horrible wounds, and the other a mild concussion, but they had their lives. Their screams had alerted Hart as she walked down the Hall. Hart of course had come to the rescue so to speak. Most of the Chantry, as well as the employees of Arman’s businesses had walked on eggshells for the remainder of the week. Arman’s edginess was barely contained, and his violent anger lashed out at the slightest provocation. Friday night as the sun set upon another cold and damp day, Arman awoke in his haven, his Beast already gnawing at him. The deaths by his command weighed heavy still on his consciousness. He felt his own Humanity slipping from his grasp, and fought to cling to it. Hart walked into Arman’s office, as he pulled his coat over his shoulders.&quot; You sure you want to deal with the Populace tonight?&quot; she asked carefully of him. &quot; I was not there for them last week, they will need me. It is my job because I am their Prince. It is not a matter of 'want' any longer...It is a matter of duty&quot; his tone was almost defeated. &quot; If you say so Arman, just...&quot; Arman’s gaze turned to her, and she let the sentence die. Hart knew that he was still struggling violently to control the anger, hurt and rage that welled under the surface. Arman went to the club, put on his best face, and tried to deal with the politics and bullshit as best as he could. &quot; A hit? Again? You have to be kidding me...&quot; Arman threw his hands up in exasperation.&quot; Yes my Prince, and I have been contacted to exact it...&quot; He left the sentence to hang in the air with its own weight. Arman looked across the desk as a Man he wasn’t entirely certain he trusted. He did however respect the man, and had begun to hold in a high degree of esteem. &quot; I need some time...and He needs some time to figure this out...I have a solution&quot; Arman rubbed his fingertips across his chin in consideration.&quot; Meet me at the warehouse out on Lompoc Avenue...you know the one right?&quot; The man nodded, and smirked slightly &quot; Yea, I know it. What do you need from me?&quot; Arman stood and walked around the desk &quot; I will bring everything we will need, you bring some firepower, and enough ammunition to make it look good.&quot; &quot; Of course...Your Highness&quot; he smiles, and turned, leaving Arman to contemplate his decision in his office alone. Fast forward to seedy warehouses in the docking district, the minor details between then and now would prove boring anyway. Arman and Hart arrived in a car, packed with the components needed to perform the act Arman had devised. The hit man of earlier and his accomplice met Arman at the backdoor. &quot; You ready to do this?&quot; Arman asked.<br>
&quot; Yea...but do what exactly?&quot; Arman handed a digital video camera to the hitter’s sidekick. &quot; He films it...you get to be the Star of our little show. I have the capability to reproduce a copy of our [i][b]poor[/b][/i] little victim, who will seem for all purposes, as real as the real thing...You just have to take him out...sound easy enough? All the while your friend there gets it all on video. Your contracts filled, and I don’t have to loose another member of my Populace.&quot; The hit man just smiled, and speaking softly &quot; Ya know, this could work&quot; true to his word Arman produced something that looked, and acted enough like the intended victim, and the Cameras rolled...And death ensued. With the ringing of automatic gunfire the crimson spray of blood, and the swift slash of blade, one seeming Kindred, is taken out, reduced to a melting pile of sludge. &quot; Now all he has to do is lay low a while, let them think he is dead, and the contracts filled. In a while, they will forget all about it...and you are all the richer for the paycheck...one assassination complete.&quot; Arman said as he handed the digital recording to the hit man. &quot; Yea and I guess you saved another one of your people in the process&quot; the other said to Arman. They parted ways, Arman turning to Hart as the approached the car.&quot; Hart...I may require some help here...&quot; She looked at him realizing he was almost drained completely, and seeing how close he was to again losing control of his beast. The Thaumaturgy he had used, had drained him almost to frenzy and hart knew it.&quot; You need to feed, Arman, Now!&quot; &quot; I know Cher`...I came somewhat prepared...there is sustenance in the car, I just need to get there. Arman fed and returned to the gathering of his city. His beast prowled close to the surface teased by being so close to released and denied at the last moment. Arman watched his flock quietly from the sidelines; he was in no mood to have to deal with bullshit directly any longer. Kieran Black, old friend and occasional pain in Arman’s ass walked up to him bold as ever, with a mischievous smile on his face. &quot; Old times, eh Arman? Things seem like I never left...um by the way...Am I still acknowledged in your domain?&quot; Arman sighed softly, and smirked. “Of course, Kieran, you are still acknowledged...just stay out of trouble ok?&quot; Arman sounded tired even to himself.&quot; What’s wrong Arman?&quot; Kieran asked, blinking inquisitive eyes at Arman &quot; The usual...&quot; Arman said, as his cell phone rang. Hitting the button &quot;Arman here, what can I do for you?&quot; &quot; Hey Arman its me&quot; the voice was so familiar, it needed no name to go with it. Arman immediately knew who it was.&quot; What’s up?&quot; &quot;Um...Arman, We seem to have a situation here...seems Ivan went got himself into a fist fight, stood taking some hits from a guy that shoulda crippled anyone else. Don' know about you, but sounds like a bit of a breach of the old 1st to me.&quot; Arman simply sighed, and hung on the phone a second. &quot; Yea, I will talk to him, Thanks Man.&quot; Arman hung up the phone. &quot; More good news?&quot; Kieran asked, smiling. &quot; Bullshit and politics&quot; Arman simply shook his head &quot;Yea, I know what you mean...Not to add to your payroll of crap, but, should someone be doing something about the moron who was shifting forms in the club in front of a bunch of mortals?&quot; Something inside Arman popped, whether it was audible or know, he would find out from Hart later, she simply turned and looked at him. &quot;Who...&quot; The word was almost a growl passing from Arman’s lips “ Ivan, the Gangrel…He uh, I uh” even for Kieran, it was odd for him to be thrown, but the look in Arman’s eyes must have been enough. Arman stared at nothing for a very long time. Nothing rolled through his mind, blankness, and silence, even on the street as cars rolled by, and people talked. Arman saw and heard nothing, even as his hand reached into his pocket, and withdrew his cell phone. The number was on autodial, ”AshHeart, Arman. Get your ass down here, to the club underground. I am out front.” Click, the line went dead as Arman hung up. Hart and Kieran were probably talking to him, not that any of the words, or even the time was noticed. AshHeart almost leapt out of the car before it stopped moving, and ran to Arman.” Arman, what’s up? What the hells going…” He stopped in mid sentence the moment Arman’s eyes met his. “ I am exercising the 6th tradition, I have declared a Blood hunt in my domain” Arman could hear the words coming out of his own mouth, and cringed inside. The thing he hated doing above all else. “ Ivan is a threat to MY domain, I have schooled him, counseled him, and given him chances…no more. AshHeart, Notify Creed, I want Ivan out of my domain immediately, one way or another, I no longer care how. He can run or he can die. You and the Scourge will see that my Orders are carried out.”  “ Can I help?” Kieran piped in almost too cheerfully. “ I don’t care, Kieran.” Arman and hart stood alone in the parking lot in front of the ‘club underground’ “Arman…you ok? Your scaring me, your like, disconnected” Hart asked in as gentle a tone as she could muster. “ I don’t know” was the only reply Arman could think of. Arman heard later that his orders were carried out, that Ivan was dead. It didn’t matter any more; Arman had become a monster, just like all the rest. The Blood on his hands would no longer wash away. Arman could hear laughter in his own head. He could hear his beast, laughing at him. Like dust in a spring rain, Arman could feel another piece of his humanity wash away. He could feel his Beast grow one step closer to control. Arman returned to the Chantry, there would be no populace meeting tonight. Hart spoke to him, chastised, taunted and played with him. She was trying in her way to break his sullen mood. She had no idea that Arman’s soul was in such turmoil. Arman excused himself, and wandered to the roof, and sat with the Gargoyles. They said nothing. He said nothing. They sat in silence, watching the night slip to the soft graying of dawns approach. Arman sat, watching, almost welcoming the sun as it started to break the hold of nights embrace. The pain, and fear of his Beast rose alarmingly to the surface, and he stood, walking to the doorway that leads inside to safety from the destroying sun. Arman glanced back one last time, before pulling the door closed. The Gargoyles shifted to stone, the dawn broke, and the latch on the door, slid home…<br>
