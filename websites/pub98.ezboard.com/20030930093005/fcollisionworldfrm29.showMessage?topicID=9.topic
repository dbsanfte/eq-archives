Crow looked at the ramshackle state of the door, and then wondered what Derla's statement meant.  &quot;Geez... How should I know?  That's really bizarre, Derla.  I'm no soothsayer, so I'm no good at predicting visions or whatnot... But, hey.  I've got the next best thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
He opened his 3i, somewhat hopelessly; it usually opened by itself when it had something important to say.  But to his surprise, the golden voice blossomed into the still, dead air around the building:<br>
<br>
/White lilies crown Death's head when he wants to.../<br>
<br>
&quot;What?  Wants to what?!&quot; Crow demanded to the silent air.  Nothing answered.  Exasperated and not wanting anything else out of the ordinary to happen that day, Crow furiously wrenched on the handle of the door.  It broke.<br>
<br>
Instead of being annoyed, he was suffused by a keen sense of trepidition.  There had been a reason for their being led here... But what was it?<br>
<br>
&quot;...Sooo...&quot;<br>

I won't let a dumb door get in my way.&quot; She looked around. &quot;I sense someone.... I think it's him... but it's so weak... I can't tell.&quot; Suddenly, someone cme down the stairs in a robe, with black hair tied back in a braid. &quot;Oh! I'm sorry. We didn't know anyone lived here... It was dilapigated and we sort of thought that we might find someone in here. He really likes hide and seek you see...&quot; She cut herself off. If he wanted them to leave, he'd better not know anything.<br>
<br>
(Kage)<br>
He had watched them come to the place in the street. He had sensed their positions from a good 3 blocks away. 'Why so upset, Enderla? Are you afraid? Of what I wonder? Mhemha. Maybe you've finally realized that I am so close to invincible its not even funny... What are you doing? NO!' He turned down his energy to the minimum for life as Enderla and the creature she had called Crow walked towards the old house. 'What in the... You've really grown, Enderla! You can even talk to the plants now! Mmm... Now.. all you need is one more test before harvest time... It will be absolutely beautifuL! Time for a little game of Guess Who?!' He ran into the bath room and changed into 'normal' attire for one who was intruded on, making his fast healing wound unnoticable, he stood at the top of the stairs. When the door was kicked open, he began to walk down. &quot;Excuse me? Who are you? This is My hotel, you know. Even if it is a little old now... pay some respect to my property, young lady!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 306<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/28/03 12:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: L'Manx Hottel (a dilipidated wannabe fancy hotel)</span><hr size=1> OOC: Neh...

Crow stepped in after Derla, hands raised in defense.  &quot;Hey, now.  I'm sorry.  She's with me.  And besides...&quot;  He stopped.  &quot;Hang on.  If this is a hotel, how come you don't want people coming in?&quot;<br>
<br>
His 3i was starting to open.  Crow put his hand on his forehead, hoping whoever was standing before them now wouldn't notice the patch of gold being projected through his fingers.  <br>

&quot;I was simply referring to the door you just so kindly smashed in... I'll have to build a new one now... Head ache, boy?&quot; He looked questioningly at Crow. &quot;You should have some asprin or something... I think I have some.&quot; Kage turned, &quot;Oh, by the way, my name is Kurt. It's nice to have visitors once in a while. This place used to be full... a while back.&quot; 'Before I got here...' He thought with a smirk. &quot;Please, feel free to make yourselfs comfortable. It's been a while since I've had company. Would you like to stay the night?&quot; 'Cause by tomorrow's sunset, I'll be able to give you round two, and I'd love to prepare you for it... It will be a most interesting fight.'<br>
<br>
(Enderla)<br>
Derla looked at the man. 'He's so familiar, but I can't remember where I saw him before. Kurt? Kuro? Is that a good enough connection to be afraid? I don't trust this guy. He's different. Crow was easy to trust, but this guy seems like a kuro kage, black shadow. &quot;Umm... we haven't exactly decided what we're going to do. We were kind of looking around. What kind of hotel is this anyway?&quot; She looked at 'Kurt' questioningly. &quot;Maybe after some more sight seeing, we'll come back and stay. We're kind of tourists. We travel alot.&quot; She looked back at Crow with a face that said, 'at least i think so...'<br>
Kurt looked at the young girl. &quot;Well, It's kind of gone downhill, but I can give you a cheap price. How much are you willing to pay?&quot;<br>
Derlas stuck her hand in her pocket and pulled out a twenty. 'my last one from the shop, but if I can get him interested, he might have some information.' She looked at Crow to see what his thoughts on this would be.<br>
<br>
Kage looked at Crow to. They didn't see it, but he had death gleaming in those eyes. 'If you mess this up, Crow, I'll kill you long and slow...'<br>

&quot;Sure... We'll stay.  Hang on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crow shuffled through his pockets, pretending to rummage for money to pay for the door and their stay; in reality, he was bringing all his attention to the hotel and its owner.  There had to have been a reason for their coming here, and there might be clues hidden in their enviroment that would indicate that reason.<br>
He came up with another twenty, and then noticed something while asking Kurt about the price of the door.<br>
<br>
Huh... No plants here.  <br>
<br>
His 3i was closed again, and Crow realized that it had probably run out of power or something.  He'd have to tell Derla what he'd noticed.  Yet, even without the 3i, he could smell death hanging in the air...<br>
<br>
There was something odd about Kurt.  Crow would have to keep an eye or two (or three...) on him.<br>
<br>
&quot;So... About that door...&quot;<br>

Hardly anything was there, It was as if Kurt, if that was really his name, was about to leave or unpack or something. &quot;So how are the services? Is it one of those bed in breakfast things or a spend the night and leave?&quot; She wasn't really paying attention to the owner. She was much more interested in the halway. All the doors were shut tight and looked like they had once been wide open. The rug was even pulled back in places where the doors swung open. <br>
<br>
(Kage)<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, the door can be replaced for 100, I think. I have most of the stuff to build a new one here. I just need to have some nails and stuff.&quot; Kage acted to be rumaging around and letting them take stock of everything. 'Just as long as you stay away from the attic, we'll get alone fine until tomorrow night, girl.' He remembered stuffing the people in the attic who had more than likely been runaways. They were ordinary humans... nothing worth trying to pass off as slaves. Too weak. He turned back to Enderla. &quot;We haven't had visters in so long, I'm afraid anything I serve, might actually kill you!&quot; He laughed at the intentional pun. &quot;I can only recommend that you eat elsewhere for your own health, and my consience!&quot; he imagined trying to test a sick slave. 'Not a good idea... She needs to be at full health to be worth more.' He turned around and said, &quot;I'll be with you in a minute. Please feel free to make yourselfs comfortable. If you want, you can choose a room to your liking. Just don't go to the attic. A bit messy and unorganized up there. You might get buried alive in the junk up there!&quot; 'I wouldn't mind loosing the boy too much, but the girl is far too important... I've been preparing her for far too long.'<br>
<br>
Enderla looked up at him, smiling. &quot;Oh don't worry. We wouldn't dream of poking our nose where it doesn't belong! Especially after the trouble we've caused!&quot; 'We're just gonna do some research on our possible enemy, that's all.' She walked down the hallway. &quot;Hmmm.... How many rooms can we pay for?&quot; She looked up at Kurt. &quot;Can we get two seperate rooms? Maybe one right next to another?&quot;<br>
He looked down. &quot;If that's what you want... go right ahead. I just have a few things to get done up here, so you go right ahead.&quot; He watched as Enderla choose the second door on the right as hers.<br>
&quot;I think I'll stay in here.&quot; She opened the door. It had an old fashioned canopy bed and an old wooden side table and a closet. 'This place really is old...' she walked through and sat down on the bed. It made a soft squeaking sound. &quot;Where will you be, Crow?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 316<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/1/03 11:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nervous?</span><hr size=1> <br>
<br>
Crow handed Kurt the money and followed Derla into her room, looking around.  He had no doubt that this was where they were supposed to be, but the 3i's reasons for its own commands were often totally obscure until the very last second.  This meant that the L'manx Hottel was either the safest place he and Derla could be, or it the was the future grounds for a horrible murder or something that could put them both in grave danger.  <br>
And still the faintest odour of death lingered on the shadowed walls...<br>
<br>
Resolving to get to the bottom of the situation no matter what the cost (unless the cost was Derla, in which case the best option was probably to run away as fast as they could), Crow turned as casually as possible to their host, who was hovering in the doorway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um... Not to be rude, but I'd like to have a private talk with my friend here.  Do you mind?&quot; Crow smiled, a simple action which usually alleviated most people of their suspicions concerning his odd appearance.<br>

Just don't do anything, okay?&quot; He left with a smirk on his face. 'Until I can get my physical revenge, I might as well bait him a bit... heheheh.' He walked into the kitchen to see if maybe he could be 'kind' and have something ready for them in the morning.<br>
<br>
(Enderla)<br>
Enderla was looking around, waiting for Crow to voice his thoughts. She heard the door shut and lock. &quot;At least this place isn't so old that it doesn't have locks... then I would be very worried.&quot; She looked at the lock. &quot;Of course... I could be wrong.&quot; the lock looked ancient and like it would break off if handled too roughly. &quot;Crow, I don't like this. Something about this place just creeps me out. And that guy... it seems like he's hiding something. And how can he have such a low energy? It's as if he's barely alive off it!?&quot; She got up to look out the window into what should've been a backyard. She gasped. Every single plant that was back there was uprooted and tipped over. &quot;What the?... I've heard of redecorating, but that's rediculous!! Grass, Flowers, Trees,... It's all dieing! Someone really doesn't like plants!&quot; She looked a while longer. &quot;That can't be just allergies,...can it? Would anyone be that desparate?&quot; She looked back at Crow. &quot;What do you think of this place? I don't know if I want to stay here an intire night... It seems like one of those old places that murders in movies happen in... like in The Haunting of Hill House... This place is so strange...&quot; She looked around. She didn't like being in a place with no plants. Even the cities had trees in some part of them and grass... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/2/03 12:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nervous?</span><hr size=1> <br>

Crow's smoky eyes followed Derla's gaze.  The view out the window only served to justify his fears... Something here was terribly wrong, and he was certain that Kurt could only be involved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Haven't seen that movie... But I have to agree with you.  Actually, it almost seems like someone's already been murdered here.&quot;  Crow raised his head and peered around the small room, as if to catch the rotting scent of dead bodies.  Then he turned back to Derla.<br>
<br>
&quot;Derla... There's something I need to tell you...&quot;  He sighed and combed his hair absently with long fingers.  &quot;My 3i doesn't seem to be as... alert anymore.  It's as if it's trying to say something, but its power is just too drained.  It can't open itself.  I think that fiasco in the theater sapped it...&quot;<br>
<br>
More worried that Derla would be worried than about the actual situation, Crow added, &quot;And I also noticed the conspicuous lack of plants here.  I don't think that's just a coincedence.&quot;<br>

We might be in the wrong place!&quot; Derla remembered her very limited healing abilities. &quot;What kind of exhaustion is it, Crow? Is it the medical kind? Or spiritual? I might be able to help, but I'd be worthless in running or fighting. I'd probably black out.&quot; She Held her hands up, as if showing him she could do it. &quot;It would be safer though... If we can run early or be on the look out.&quot; She looked appealingly at him. &quot;If it's the only way I can help you... You've already put your life on the line for me...&quot; She waited for his answer. &quot;I'd only be out for a few hours...I'm sure...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 321<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/2/03 12:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nervous?</span><hr size=1> OOC: Qninde has taken the chibi into Mystical Lands (that's right above Small Towns)!

&quot;Oh, jeez...&quot;  Crow stared at Derla from across the room.  &quot;Heal the 3i? ... Wow... That would be something... I barely know what's happened to it; this has never happened before...&quot;<br>
<br>
Crow scratched the back of his head, aware of the synteshart's weight pulling at his back.  &quot;Hmm... I suppose it's worth a try.  But what do you mean by 'only being out for a few hours'?!  I'm not exactly in favour of anything that's going to knock you out, especially not with that slightly creepy guy skulking around the place.&quot;  <br>
Although he was normally very amicable towards other people, even strangers, Derla's predicament was putting his otherwise friendly nature on hold.  Crow lowered his hand and folded his arms across his chest, watching her.<br>

<br>

Kurt was sitting on the roof, right above their window. Nearly hearing everything. 'Poor guy. He's defenseless....perfect!' He pulled out a long curved blade from behind his back. 'Derla is my prize. If you want to stand in my way, I'll be happy to cut you down.. let's just see what you have to say to her Little request. She oviously loves you... why else would she put herself in danger?

<br>
Crow reached up and gently touched the skin of the closed 3i.  &quot;Yeesh... It'll open on my say so, but... I can't say it'll be any good for heightened awareness...&quot;<br>
<br>
Beginning to pace around the room (and unsheathing his synteshart in the process), Crow began to talk again.  &quot;Okay... Just today, while Kage is still somewhat out of commission. ... Um... But first there's something I have to ask...&quot;<br>
<br>
Pausing, Crow turned to look Derla in the face.  &quot;Don't take this the wrong way, but... I think it would be better if I slept in your room tonight.  I mean, there's no way I can leave you alone, even for a few hours... Think about it...&quot;<br>
<br>
Crow held the synteshart upright on the floor, one of the blades digging partially into the soft wood, awaiting Derla's answer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kerrifairy05>KerriFairy05</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/2/03 2:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nervous?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Umm... I see your point...&quot; Derla was stammering. 'Would it be alright?' She wondered what could possibly happen. He was trying to protect her. &quot;Okay... I'll agree to that.... I'm going to warn you though, I'll be out for a while after I heal you. Just expect it, okay?&quot; She stood up and confronted him. She reached up her hands to the place where his 3i usually stood wide open. She shut her eyes and consintrated on it. She felt her energy moving from her to the eye. Suddenly, it felt like it began pulling the energy away on its own. Derla gasped and tried to regain control of the energy leaving her body. She pulled some of it back and the exhaution hit. She couldn't even stand anymore. She opened her eyes to stare into Crow's smokey ones. &quot;I think that did it...&quot; Then she passed out, her whole body going limp.<br>
<br>
(Kage)<br>
Kage could feel exactly what was going on, because he was pulling at some of her energy too. 'Why waste a perfectly good time to test her control?' his healing was sped up a bit, but nothing extreme. 'She's very good with control, when she feels she has to be.' He looked down at the now half way healed wound. 'Unforunatly, she still needs some lessons on focas. Using her hands? How old fashioned.' He climbed into the window in the attic. 'No reason to let them be alone for long...' he got back into his Kurt getup and started walking down the hallway to their room. He knocked on Enderla's door. &quot;Is everything alright in there? Sir? Miss? You are alright, aren't you?&quot; He smirked quietly. 'Cause if Enderla isn't, she might need medical help, and we don't want her to have any records here to prove that she went missing when she leaves...' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 327<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/2/03 2:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nervous?</span><hr size=1> <br>
Crow shook his head, trying to get his mind clear as soon as possible.  No sense in having the 3i re-energized if he couldn't use its advantage.  He stood over Derla, who had fainted on the bed; he was about to check her pulse when someone rapped on the door.<br>
<br>
Turning, Crow heard Kurt's voice coming through the door.  &quot;Is everything alright in there? Sir? Miss? You are alright, aren't you?&quot; <br>
<br>
At that moment, the 3i seemed to spark with an unknown energy.  It burst open, and Crow felt an intense pain shooting through his forehead.<br>
<br>
Gasping, Crow leaned part of his weight on the synteshart as the 3i began to speak.  Trying to ignore the flashes of fire streaming through his head, Crow yelled as loudly as he could, drowning out the sound of the 3i's voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh!  Ah... We're okay in here!!  Everything is perfectly alright!! ... My friend's just having a little nap, that's all...&quot;<br>
<br>
He paused for a split second to make sure that the 3i had finished its message, then slid to the floor.  That had been horrible!!  Crow stared wildly at the door, then back at Derla.  If that hadn't arisen a few suspicions, he didn't know what would...<br>
<br>
And worst of all, the 3i had confirmed their deepest fears.  Kuro was near... And he had them right where he wanted them.<br>
<br>
Wake up, Derla... Crow thought numbly, staring at her pale face.  We're in trouble now...<br>

He moved to a part of the attic where he could feel Endrla beneath him. 'Rest now. You have one more major test before you are ready... and then it's off to market for farmer's little cash cow...' He looked around the backyard. 'Everything is going perfectly...'<br>
<br>
(derla)<br>
Derla was sleeping, but she could feel Crow nearby. She could also feel Kage, now that her own energy wasn't getting in the way of his. 'Kage? CROW! I have to wake up! Oh why is this taking so long?!?

Crow sat on the dusty floor, almost unable to believe how bad their situation had just gotten.  <br>
<br>
If it weren't for Derla being unconscious, we'd be out of here...<br>
<br>
Looking around the room. Crow contemplated the idea of just hauling Derla out of the hotel and running away.  But he discarded that idea as being pointless and dangerous; Kurt, or Kuro, or whoever that guy was, probably wouldn't let them escape in a hurry.<br>
<br>
...I shouldn't have let her do this... Was healing the 3i worth it?  I mean... <br>
<br>
His thoughts sprawled aimlessly across his mind, Crow wanted to lie down and join Derla in her haunted slumber.  But that would have been suicide.<br>
<br>
Forced to wait, crouched by Derla's side and hoping and praying that she would just wake up, Crow felt a trace of helplessness seeping into his otherwise somewhat reckless spirit.  He sighed, combing his fingers through his hair as he often did when he was agitated, and watched Derla sleep.<br>
<br>
This is torture... I could be out of here, but I can't leave Derla alone!  I'm stuck, and she's stuck.  The perfect trap.<br>
<br>
Crow stared at the door, waiting, and watching for any signs of an attack.<br>
<br>
If you don't wake up in half and hour, Derla... then....<br>
<br>
Crow slumped, the 3i still sending an occasional crackle of pain through his skull.<br>
<br>
Then I don't know what I'll do... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kerrifairy05>KerriFairy05</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/2/03 4:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is not good</span><hr size=1> Derla could feel herself stirring very gently...

Crow fell backwards as Derla made a rush for the door.  &quot;Gak...&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking up, he was horrified to see Kurt standing there in the doorway.  He got up and hastily jammed the synteshart back in its sheath, hoping Kurt wouldn't ask about it.<br>
<br>
Although I'm sure now that he's already intimately familiar with the blade, Crow thought, staring hard at their host.  He walked over to stand next to Derla.<br>
<br>
&quot;...Ah heh heh... Somewhere to eat?  Sounds good... What's the name of the place?&quot; Crow said, casually cheerful.  At the same time, his mind was in turbulence.  <br>
<br>

Kage held the rag tenderly. 'Do you value her? Cuz if you do, you'll back off...' He put his hand on Derla's shoulder. &quot;It's not far, It's called the El Chico or something.&quot; He began leading her away. <br>

Crow's eyes widened as Kage began dragging Derla out into the corridor.  &quot;Hey... Hey!!&quot;  He began advancing towards the pair, taking out the synteshart; but slowly, as he didn't want Kage hurting Derla if he came too close.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well well, Kage,&quot; said Crow, somehow managing to keep his head.  The 3i was flaring brightly, but since it was already obvious that they were in danger, it was silent.  &quot;It may be true that I won't attack you for fear of hurting Derla... But will YOU risk hurting her?&quot;  Crow took a step for every one that Kage took backwards.<br>
