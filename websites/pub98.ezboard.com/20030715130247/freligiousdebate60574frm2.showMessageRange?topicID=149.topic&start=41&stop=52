OK, pretty funny, but give me a break. I seriously doubt you all look at life this negatively overall <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
LDS belief is that leaving the garden of Eden was opening the door to mortality (you know, mortality, it's a good thing overall), not something that &quot;poisened&quot; us all. Adam and Eve opened the door into mortality for everyone and Christ opened the door back out for everyone (remember, LDS believe we will all be resurrected and go to some level of heaven). No one was &quot;punished&quot; for something they didn't do.<br>
<br>
And you know, I was thinking today about what a horrible parent my neighbor is. She actually purchased a bike for her child. They mutually agreed that he could ride it and she also purchased and suggested that he wear his helmet and then taught him the rules of safety.<br>
<br>
Well, of course as soon as he was out of her sight he took the helmet off and recklessly careened across their lawn where her two  smaller children were playing an knocked  them down, then fell down himself and hit his head. One of the little kids was hurt pretty badly. It was terrible.<br>
<br>
What kind of parent lets their kid get a bike anyway? Obviousy she is sadistic and egotistical for providing a situation where that could happen. She should have bought a tandem bike and been with him every second of every day to make sure she could force him to follow the safety rules. Sure, he wouldn't gain the same experience or knowledge had he been allowed to try it on his own at some point, and sure, not every child would have done what he did and most would have a great experience and not hurt anyone else, but it is still completely sick and wrong for parents to provide these opportunities to children.<br>
<br>
Don't you agree?<br>

Multiply it by several hundreds of millions of the horrendous suffering, and have Mom standing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>right there</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and being perfectly capable of stopping it, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> letting it happen &quot;for the growth and experience&quot;, then yeah, I agree.<br>
<br>
Heidi, are you saying that God isn't around (He's off playing golf or something) and that we are basically on our own, or are you saying He isn't capable of intervening, or something else?<br>
<br>
Here's a counter-analogy. Chris was walking along the street one day and he heard a woman screaming, clearly in distress. He ran to see what was going on, and found a teenage punk beating her and raping her. Chris is a big guy, and he's been involved in a few street fights and has had some training. But he decides to walk away. After all,<br>
<br>
(A) God has given us &quot;free will&quot; to live with our decisions, so both the perp and the woman will have to live with the consequences of the decisions that brought them to that point;<br>
<br>
(B) the perp will learn from his experience, and in his old age he will come to regret the wrongfulness of his decisions and actions;<br>
<br>
(C) the lady will grow stronger from her suffering;<br>
<br>
(D) God's going to punish the transgressions appropriately anyway after we die;<br>
<br>
(E) since God has given us &quot;Free Will&quot;, they who are we to intervene in someone else's choices and actions, even if someone else is inordinately hurt?<br>
<br>
Clearly, Chris was acting (by not intervening) much as God does, don't you think?<br>

Whanda, am I missing something here? How old was the kid? Are you just talking about a regular old pedal bike? Don't most kids have these? My daughter (who just turned 6) has a new pedal bike and we'll be teaching her to ride it once the snow melts. Riding a bike is a healthy and pleasurable activity in my estimation.<br>
<br>
My daughter wouldn't dare run her baby brother down. Your neighbor's kid sounds like a twisted little sociopath to me. <br>

I think if parents are constantly on top of kids &quot;making sure&quot; they do whatever, they don't learn self control. Why bother learning self-control when the parent is there to control them? <br>

I liked the way he stated things so I wanted to share Jeff's (Dilbert dude) thoughts.....<br>
<br>
In the Garden, when Adam and Eve made a choice to follow their own will, instead of God’s will, they stepped out on their own. Evil existed at that time, but within the Garden, as long as they obeyed God, Adam and Eve were immune from the results of evil. They were still subject to temptation, but since they (at that time) had no sin, they were not subject to the consequences of it. There was no death, no disease, no suffering. <br>
<br>
When they sinned—when they exercised their choice, they subjected themselves to the natural consequences of sin. God told them that they would now be subject to death and that things would be “hard” for them. By the sweat of their brow, they would now have to deal with the consequences of evil.<br>
<br>
So many questions that people have with the concept of God revolves around why a loving God would allow suffering and evil in the first place. Surely a sovereign God would be powerful enough to destroy Evil. Indeed we are told in the Bible that Satan, death and even evil itself will be destroyed, but not until its time. <br>
<br>
So, why wait? Why not just do away with evil now, end the suffering and be done with the whole business of sin? The answer, I believe is found in the books of Job and Isaiah. The theme running through the book of Job delineates the conflict between good and evil. The theme running through the book of Isaiah is the remedy to the conflict, the mission of the Messiah. In these two books (as well as other places) we see in the conflict, an accuser, accusing God of being arbitrary and that God incites obedience by either promises of favor or by fear, rather than by love. In the Book of Job Satan asserts that Job only obeys God because God has blessed him and that if God were to remove his blessings and allow him, the accuser, to inflict harm, that Job would curse God. <br>
<br>
I do believe the story of Job is literal (many believe it to only be allegorical), however I also believe it is told to give us a kind of behind-the-scenes peek at who causes our suffering and difficulties in life, and why a loving God allows it.<br>
<br>
Also, I believe God has allowed humanity to experiment with sin to provide a means to end it, forever. When Christ returns to gather his elect, God will have representatives in humanity who have experience with rebellion and sin, who clung to the Blood of Christ for salvation. The saved will be witnesses to the heavenly beings, the angels and all heavenly creation to demonstrate in living fashion God’s great love for us. They have already seen the great love of God on the cross. Then they will have eyewitness accounts from those who have lived in sin, and know destitution first hand.<br>
<br>
Drug addicts can testify how God lifted them from despair and gave them hope. Adulterers can testify how God forgave and saved their marriages. Murderers can testify how God replace hatred with love in their hearts. Liars can testify how God restored to them, truth. Sinners can testify how God reconciled them to life, turning them away from sin. <br>
<br>
Sin goes on for now, perhaps so that the universe, looking on, may see how rebellion turns to sin; how sin turns to despair; how despair turns into suffering and death. In the end, evil will be destroyed, and for those who are saved, and the heavenly beings, rebellion and sin will not be an option--by choice! <br>

While I dont necessarily agree with every detail of his explanation, I think he summed up the reason for suffering and bad stuff in the world pretty good. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   - Shirene<br>

<br>
Job as a story only works if you don't look at anything aside from Job.  Sure, he was beat on by the adversary on a bet with god.  Sure god tossed out every rule each time the adversary teased him (how easy is THIS guy to manipulate?) Somehow, this freewilled independant spirit is okay to abuse by god because people seem okay with thinking of themselves as god's property, especially in light of their eternal salvation.  Any arbitrary level of abuse is okay so long as they get to valhalla.  Sure.<br>
<br>
What about Job's wives and children?  All of them were killed and stolen and destroied to work this bet.  Any of them who were not saved were cheated by god for claiming them (or allowing them to be claimed) before their time and opportunity to redeem themselves.  If god just 'let them in' for being in his little bet, then what does that mean in terms of the worth of salvation?  Why do some have to work so damn hard (like Job did) and others get a free pass for being extras in the play?  If you say god 'just knew' who would be saved and they weren't on the list then you toss out the idea of free will entirely.<br>
<br>
Drug addicts, murderers, adulterers, deceivers, and 'sinners' all bask in the love of god?  What a wonderful crowd to hang out with.  Perhaps they need the deception of god to give them strength because they lack the faith in themselves to do it on their own.  Like Dumbo learning to fly, only holding the magic crucifix instead of the magic feather.  God the Father, Son and Holy Crutch.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A man at the bar turns to this woman next to him and asks her, &quot;Will you sleep with me for a million dollars?&quot;  She looks at him and says, &quot;A million dollars?  Sure!&quot;  He takes a sip from his drink and says, &quot;OK how about 20 dollars?&quot;  She looks at him appaled and says, &quot;What do I look like to you, a whore?&quot; He replies, &quot;Lady we already established you are a whore, the rest is just haggling over the price.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> God abused Job, worse he slaughtered the innocents of his family.  Abuse is abuse and if you can only differentiate it in terms of degree it is a poor argument all around.  You cannot beat the crap out of your spouse or child then buy them icecream or jewelry to make it better.  God cannot beat the crap out of his children and thern pay them off with Elisium to make that any better either. <p><br>
