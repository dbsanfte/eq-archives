<br>
<br>
“Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you”  1 Peter 5:7<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I missed this class, but am working towards my degree via real life experience.  Take today for instance…..<br>
<br>
It all began about 10:30 a.m. during our normal morning routine.  I was on the treadmill with visions of a leaner, toner body on mind, the baby was fast asleep dreaming of sugar-plum fairies and Ben was playing with his new foam cars dreaming of being a ‘struction man while watching Mr. Rogers.<br>
<br>
By 10:50, Ben had a new dream:  to see how far up his nose he could insert a piece of foam.  Yes, that would be a torn off piece of foam from his new car.  Now, as far as I know, neither Mr. Rogers nor the Teletubbies have ever done this trick—do the tubbies even have noses?  Anyway, I am certain that this was a Ben T original idea.<br>
<br>
Carrying my crying, rapidly becoming hysterical child upstairs, I take him to the bathroom to scope out the situation.  “Sit here while I find the flashlight”, I tell him.  Returning with the extra light to shine up his nostril, I spot the glowing piece of yellow foam.  Ah, I can grab that with my tweezers.<br>
<br>
I must have thought this audibly because at the mention of tweezers, my pre-schooler screamed and shouted, “No!”  Holding him and reassuring him that all would be fine, I coax him into breathing through his mouth and blowing very hard out his nose.  A few good blows and that thing will come flying out I thought.  Problem was, Ben doesn’t blow his nose like the rest of the population.  In fact, you could hardly label it as blowing at all.  He refuses to close his mouth entirely, so therefore the mucous and other nasty debris remain, while healthy wads of saliva come flying forth.  Again and again we tried, but alas, you can lead a child to tissues but you can’t make them blow.<br>
<br>
Ben is still crying and out of control while I go to search for my tweezers.  By this time, my previous stable—if you could even call it that—frame of mind was waning.  I search my bathroom drawers frantically looking for the coveted tweezers.  Tweezers, tweezers, WHERE ARE THE  @#!%* TWEEZERS!  ….Oh, right.  I always carry them in my make-up bag…..here they are.  With Ben still crying and shaking, I lay him down on a bath towel, wipe the tears away and tell him what I am about to attempt.  With a 50lb., 100 watt flashlight in one hand and the tweezers in the other, I begin.  “Hold your head like so…..can you push your nostril up like this Ben?” ….oh, this will never work.  Giving up the flashlight, I push his nose up with one hand, go in with the other and all the while telling Ben the story from my childhood.  The one where I stuck a Pez up my nose.<br>
<br>
After a few minutes or maybe it was seconds of this, I see that I am getting nowhere.  After an hour I have been through every imaginable emotion mothers know.  And all without the aid of PMS or Steel Magnolias.  Ben is still crying and it doesn’t help when I tell him that his nose will continue to swell the more he cries.  It also doesn’t help when I tell him we will have to go to the hospital if mommy can’t get the foam out.  After a brief chat with Will—the calm parent—I decide to give it a rest.  He is not in a life threatening situation, and to sit down, read a book or watch Arthur, or Clifford the Big Red Dog, maybe Ben will calm down.  This works!  In fact, it worked so well that Ben decided having a piece of foam up your nose wasn’t such a bad thing after all.<br>
<br>
All was quiet and calm again so I took a shower, fed the baby and made myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  After an hour or so Ben is breathing through his mouth, he is calm, NOW maybe I can take another look and see if I can pry that thing out.  Ben is NOT cooperative.  Fortunately, he wants a peanut butter and jelly too.  “You can’t have a sandwich until you let mommy pull that thing out of your nose.”  (Now, that statement belongs in every Parenting 101 class).  He refuses, gets all upset AGAIN, and the tears flow forth.<br>
<br>
Another brief chat with Will yields a new idea—close off his ears, hold the clear nostril closed and blow hard through his mouth.  I actually did this.  It may work for some kids with erasers up their nose, but not Ben.  It must have to do with the weight of the object or something.  Maybe if I could get him to sneeze it would come flying out! “Brilliant idea Amy”, I thought to myself as I led my trusting little one outdoors.  “Here, stand right in the sunlight…..let me blow some of these dandelion seeds on you too…”  “ACHOO!” …..nothing.  “ACHOO!” ……again, no flying yellow foam.<br>
<br>
I am frustrated to the point of tears now, wanting to help my son, wanting to shield him from a scary situation at the hospital, and wanting to run out the door and not look back!  Ok, we have to go the doctor’s office NOW.<br>
<br>
I am chewing my nails and scurrying down the road to make it to the clinic by 3:30.  I’m making good time, ….making good time…Oh!  School Bus!  I am tempted to put my emergency flashers on at this point but figured if an officer of the law pulled me over he would never believe my story.  Partly because Ben and baby Josie are sleeping like angels in the back seat.  I calm down and think good thoughts, pray for help and wait for an opportunity to PASS THAT BUS.  Did I mention it was raining buckets at this time?<br>
<br>
We make it on time and I am searching for Will as he agreed to meet me there.  No Blue Blazer.  How can that BE?  He left way before me.  I call him on the cell phone and discover he is banking.  Oh, please get me a lollipop while you’re there and WOULD YOU GET HERE ASAP- YOU KNOW BEN HAS A PIECE OF FOAM UP HIS NOSE!<br>
<br>
Will arrives in about two minutes.  We take Ben inside, sign his name and I leave him in Will’s care.  Josie needs fed by this time and actually, I am more upset than Ben at this point.<br>
<br>
I wait in the truck for what seems like hours, but was probably only thirty minutes.  Next thing I know, here comes Ben with a tear-stained face and a purple lollipop in his hand.  The foam is gone, Ben can breathe, I can breathe and Will has earned a merit badge for going in the room to watch a doctor and 4 Storm Troopers hold Ben down and pull a piece of foam from his nose.<br>
<br>
He didn’t get to keep the foam.  I imagine the good doctor has a little box under her desk labeled “Items Removed From Kids’ Noses”.  Something akin to the fascination people have with the contents of sharks’ stomachs.  As far as post-foam removal treatment, the doctor suggested Tylenol—she forgot my Valium.<br>
<br>
I can assure you that Ben has learned a valuable lesson here, as this is what I heard him say to a little boy in the waiting room, “Do you know what will happen if you stick something up your nose?”  ….silence……”You’ll have to go to the doctor and let ‘em get it out.”<br>
<br>
All I want to know is, do I get an “A” for surviving this, or is this new grey hair my badge of honor?<br>
<br>

But afterwards it is always funny {{HEARTJOYS}}.<br>
<br>
I have a few of my own, the best is being on a first name basis with the 'poison control center' for Sarah (my eldest) 1st taking a bite of stick deodorant.  2nd eating a packet of sillica, you know the stuff they use to keep electronics dry? Comes in a little packet.  There were others, but the best one was this.....<br>
<br>
I was going out with a girlfriend, a night out for mom.  My husband was working and going to school at that time to become an electronic technician.  So he needed to stay home and study.   Sarah is 3 years old, has had an ear infection and is on amoxicillan.  Before I leave, I make a point of telling both my hubby and Sarah that she'll need to take the medicine before she goes to bed that evening.  I leave.  What happens?  Dad gets involved with studying, Sarah decides it's time for her to take her medicine, so she tells her dad.  He says, &quot;Wait a minute.&quot;  But when you are 3 years old a minute is absolutely forever, right??  She waits, but he doesn't notice or stop.  She goes into the kitchen, gets into the refrigerator, opens the bottle (this is supposed to be a child-proof bottle??),  She proceeds to drink the whole bottle of amoxicillan, puts the cap back ON the bottle, puts it back in the refrigerator.  After an unspecified amount of time, my husband goes to the refrigerator to find an empty bottle of amoxicillan.  Sarah declares, &quot;I took my medicine!&quot;  <br>
Husband then proceeds to call the poison control center, they calmly and sweetly tell my husband that she should be fine.  The most that could happen is that she'll have some diarrhea, but to NOT give her any more of the amoxicillan. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :doh --><img src=http://www.geocities.com/bat3193/smiley1/11doh.gif ALT=":doh"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I walked back in the house at the end of the story, husband has just gotten off the phone, Sarah is crying.  She doesn't understand that her dad was just worried sick, and my husband's eyes are wide and wild, hair in a mess from him brushing it up with his hand, Sarah in his arms.  The moral of the story?   1. Never ever believe child-proof caps are child-proof.  2. A child of 3 does not have any patience. And 3. Never tell your child they need to take their medicine, just give it to them when necessary.<br>
<br>
It is funny, you have to realize how independent Sarah was at age 3 to be able to do all of that.  As far as grey hair, you've seen mine? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But I say you deserve an 'A', you didn't panic, you did what you could, that didn't work so you went to where you could get help.  Isn't that all any of us can do?  I loved the story though, thanks for posting it. <br>

Our poison control &quot;hotline&quot; is pathetic.  My son ate the leaf of an outdoor shrub (fortunately a neighbout new what it was), however, it was after five pm, and I wound up on hold constantly hearing, &quot;all our attendents are busy, if this is an emergency (what call to Poison Control ISN'T an emergency!?!?!?) hang up and dial 911.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, my son was acting no worse for the wear (I swear, two year olds are virtually indestructable - unfortuately whatever they come into contact with generally isn't) so I waited for the person to come on the phone.<br>
<br>
Now, while waiting on the phone I happened to be sitting in front of our computer, which has DSL internet.  Hey, I can surf while on the phone.  I called up the ever trusty Google, went to advanced search, typed the name of the plant into the &quot;exact phrase&quot; box and toxicity into the general search box and came immediately to a site stating that the plant was not toxic.<br>
<br>
About a minute after reacing the site and finding the correct info, the Poison Control attendant answered the call.  Since I was feeling relieved, I decided to be nice and not tell her that I had already found the info on the internet while on hold.  I was tempted though. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

Both my wife and I are Advanced Level First Aid Instructors (in Canada that would be training roughly equal to an EMT-B in the U.S.) and we both have a program called ePocrates on our PDA handhelds that give drug information including which ones don't mix.<br>
<br>
With all that, it is nice to know that we could pretty much treat anything our son could do to himself and we also know when to get help vs. when a trip to the doctor would really be pointless.<br>
<br>
The agency we teach for has an agreement with the main paediatric hospital in our city to run &quot;baby safe&quot; courses for parents of newborns who had to spend time in the neo-natal ICU.  Before they are allowed to take the child home, they have to take the course.  This may sound overboard, but I really think every parent should know basic first aid for infants and children.  There are certain situations where that 5 or 10 minute interval before paramedics arrive can mean life or death but where knowing what to do can prevent the death during that time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's my public service announcement at this time.  Call your local accredited First Aid training organization (such as the Red Cross or St. John Ambulance - depending where you live) and sign up for a course today! <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

Way to go Esdras and wife!  It was only through God's grace that we managed through all of the taste/try period of our kids' lives.  I don't know about you all, but with my first baby I made trips to the hospital right and left, especially as an infant/toddler.  Everytime that fever hit 102, tylenol was given and of course it would kick in after we got to the hospital.  Also, with my first, she would jerk when going to sleep?  We had to have an EKG done on her for that, it ended up being just the way her muscles relaxed as she went to sleep, thank God. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The most education I've had is for first aid, but it didn't include what medicines could not be combined.  I did learn CPR and how to handle really bad cuts, but that's about it.  I'm SO very glad there is a hospital no more than 5 minutes away from my home, believe me it has come in handy to put it mildly. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :bsfl --><img src=http://www.geocities.com/bat3193/smiley9/shy.gif ALT=":bsfl"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'm glad you learned those.  As long as you know how to deal with the big three issues (not breathing, no pulse or server bleeding), you are in pretty good shape.<br>
<br>
When I teach the standard level course, I always stress that they are learning skills that can save a life.  BUT, if they are unsure about what to do or feel overwhelmed that they should call 911. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>
