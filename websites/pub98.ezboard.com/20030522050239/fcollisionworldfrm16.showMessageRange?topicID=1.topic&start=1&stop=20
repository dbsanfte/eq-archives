“7 D wins again.”<br>
<br>
The people in the room starts to scream and shout and grabbing on Dominic’s sleeve in their excitement. He was know to come to the Casino a lot and take the house.<br>
<br>
“Okay all drinks tonight are on me!” <br>
<br>
Everyone in the Casino goes even wilder with excitement as Dominic walk to cash in his 4 bag full of chips.<br>
<br>
“This should be enough for tonight drinks.”<br>
<br>
“Wow sir this seems to be more than enough.”<br>
<br>
“Then what is not blown on drinks keep as your tip.” Dominic says as he places a cigarette in his mouth and pumps into a hot waitress. “Well it seem I’m getting more lucky every minute.”<br>
<br>
The young blonde gives him a sexy smirk as she looks at the bulge in his pants.<br>
<br>
“You don’t know how luck your about to get.” She grabs his hand and writes her number no it then pulls him close to her and what she likes to do best in bed then shows him her tongue ring as she walks off.<br>

“Wow not many female like it like that.” Dominic says to himself as he walk to the private parking to get in his Viper.<br>

They're playing cards inside and look shocked to realize that they've stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you Henry!&quot; Leon yells obnoxiously and saunters out of the car. Zil climbs out too, behind him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nice place,&quot; she says.<br>
<br>
Leon looks her over. &quot;Some night you had... Let's get you some new clothes, they have a coupla' stores in there.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiles. It's been a while since they've seen one another. In fact, more than 7 years have passed.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you're an assassin now?&quot; she asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;The owner of a ring actually.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So... why'd you hire Nina to get me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Leon looks at her, his eyes are sad. <br>
<br>
Zil winces. &quot;It's still happening?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Even worse now. He has grown... smarter. He doesn't just demolish everything anymore. He plans. He connives. He goes after those closest to me. You're one of the very few left, actually. I'm sorry, I really am, but it's better that you stay with me. I may need your help.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What about Nina?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh... she poses little danger to me. He may have grown smarter but I have grown...um... WISER!&quot;<br>
<br>
Zil laughs.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will deal with her later.&quot;<br>

I packed the helmet and adjusted my hood. ((Typical Zil.)) I strolled into the back entrance, ignoring the title: STAFF ONLY on it. I swiped a few decks off the counter and whistled casually as moved into the changing room. I looked through the hangers for my size and quickly put it on. I grabbed a bag and stuffed my cloak and tattered rags that I called 'clothes' into it. I slung it over my shoulder and tucked my hair tightly into a cap. I adjusted the name tag that said I was now &quot;Ashley&quot;. I glanced in the mirror, looking now like a completely different person. ((So easy.)) I moved out into the crowds of people and took over a black jack table. <br>
<br>
&quot;Boss says he needs to talk to you, Rick.&quot; He nodded and ran into the back, panic written all over his face. ((What a dumbass.)) I smiled to the players. &quot;Hi. I'm Ashley and I'll be taking over for Rick.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Hurry up, lady. We ain't got all day.&quot; I smirked at the old man who smoked his cigarette impaitently. I withdrew a deck and shuffled then dealt. Some hit and others stayed. He grinned as he suggested we raised the bet. They agreed as some folded. I glanced at my cards. ((10 and a jack...)) I adjusted the cap that shaded my eyes and flipped the deck with angel's speed. I pulled the ace quickly out before any of them could blink. ((Hands are faster than the eyes.)) The arrogant man stayed as I showed my cards. <br>
<br>
&quot;21.&quot; I took the money to my side as the man slammed his fists down on the table. <br>
<br>
&quot;er... NOT FAIR!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Please lower your voice or else I'm going to have to ask you to leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You @#%$ bitch-&quot; I snapped my fingers as two security guards came to my side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Escort this gentleman to the door.&quot; The broke, enraged man was dragged out as he shouted more curses. I smiled disarmingly to the other players who laughed at the pitiful sight. I dealt another round and for the first time, looked bout the casino. I spotted Zil and Leon at a poker table and smirked. ((Just a few more games, then I'll get goin'.)) I continued on in a curteous manner as I won some more cash. I fiddled lightly with the black cross as Zil and Leon approached. &quot;Welcome.&quot; I said in the higher fake voice I used. Zil and Leon laughed about something then Zil stopped abruptly, seeing my cross then my nametag. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ashley?&quot; She burst out laughing as Leon gave a confused look. My sensatory system increased as I heard her whisper to Leon, &quot;Bet as little as possible. You don't got a shot with this dealer.&quot; I dealt the cards and waited paitently. Zil bet very little and Leon bet the average amount. Leon smiled confidently, oblivious to my existance. <br>
<br>
&quot;21!&quot; He proclaimed as he laid down his cards.<br>
<br>
&quot;21.&quot; I responded calmly as I put down my hand. His face faulted. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wha...?!&quot; I collected the money, confused. ((His eyes seem different from before. He seems like a nice guy now but back there on the street...)) I shook it off and smiled. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for playing. This is the end of my shift and Rick will take over again. Thank you again.&quot; I bowed slightly in respect then went to the back. ((God. How can people where heels?!)) I discarded the clothes and opened the bag, putting my black, back strap belly shirt, black jeans, and my leather knee high boots on. I tossed the cap to the side and put my cloak back on. ((Much better.)) I stashed the loot in my cloak pocket. <br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; I turned to find a woman shout out in shock. &quot;Y-YOU'RE THAT WANTED MURDERER HOTARU VALENTINE!&quot; I rolled my purple eyes and put on my hood. <br>
<br>
&quot;What you gonna do bout it?&quot; I asked aggitated. She slammed on the silent alarm. ((Opps.)) I kicked the door open and quickly looked at the crowd. I spotted slow but steady movement of armed guards heading my way. I rubbed the side of my face. &quot;Ugh.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;She's over here!&quot; The woman started to shout. I ran over to her and gave her a strong punch to her stomach, knocking the air out of her. ((Bitch.)) I moved quickly into the dressing room, baracading the door. I ripped open the cover of the ventilation shaft and moved quickly inside. I glanced down and spotted Zil and Leon. ((They're doing well...))<br>
<br>
&quot;This way!&quot; I exhaled angrily and kept moving. I stopped at the end and looked up to see the starry sky waiting. I jumped straight up and crashed through the cover. I landed with ease on the roof and sprinted to the edge then jumped to the other rooftop just in time as the guards emerged from the crawlspace. I slid down and relaxed as I saw them go back inside, commenting how the woman in the dressing room was a lying bitch yet they had to secure the whole building. ((Think I'll hang low and wait for Zil to finish up.)) My muscles began to spaz as I exhaled shakily. ((hold up a little while longer...))  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zil15>Z I L 15</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/6/03 1:33:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: (random long entry! weiii!)</span><hr size=1> Zil was well aware of the guards going insane...and she knew why too...<br>

'hiding...we're always hiding...from others, and even from ourselves...but no one can hide forever...'<br>
she sighed and upped her bet.  <br>
just as the dealer dealt the cards, but before zil saw them, she declared, &quot;blackjack.&quot;  <br>
She started gathering the money, but the dealer stopped her.<br>
&quot;Just a second, Miss, you haven't even seen your cards...&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't need to.  But since you do...they're right there.&quot;  Zil scooped up the money and the dealer snatched up her cards and looked them over before glancing up at Zil, completely confused.  <br>
&quot;How'd you know...?&quot;<br>
&quot;I just did.&quot;  She stood up, &quot;Come on Leon, this game gets old fast.&quot;<br>
&quot;What's going on, Zil?&quot; Leon asked, walking beside her.  <br>
&quot;Stuff.&quot; Zil replied, glancing around before stepping up to the bar and ordering three drinks.<br>
&quot;Why three?&quot;  Leon asked.<br>
&quot;You'll see...&quot;  Zil took the three sodas, tossed one to Leon, and headed for the back exit.  <br>
Stepping out into the back alley, Zil leaned against the wall and cracked open her root beer.  <br>
&quot;Zil...&quot;  <br>
Zil just smirked at Leon, &quot;You'll see...&quot;<br>
Just then, Hotaruflew down and landed gracefully in the alley.  <br>
&quot;Hey whore.&quot;  Zil tossed the third soda at Hotaru before glancing at Leon, &quot;Told ya.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hotaruvalentine>Hotaru Valentine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/6/03 3:37:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: (random long entry! weiii!)</span><hr size=1> I adjusted the hood over my eyes and smirked.

Not in the mood and pain I was in at that moment. ((Wow. Seems like he really hasn't heard much.))<br>
<br>
&quot;So why's she wanted for murder?&quot; I turned my back slightly to him. I hated gangs and rings. ((F*ckin' Rianchrist.)) Zil started to explain,<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, it was more like a massive genocide... in about ten different solar systems.&quot; I forgot Zil knew about my past criminal history. I'd forgotten that I was once hunted by my own crew for the bounty on my head, then it changed to be used rather than turned in. ((Now it's just the turning in part that's left.)) I tuned out of the convo, not proud of the things I'd done. ((I'm glad she's just saying one of the little things... if you call mass murder little. If this guy is working with my damned brother Rianchrist, he's dead.)) <br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me.&quot; I gave a slight bow then ambled down the side walk, leaving Zil to explain the rest to the boy. My mind began to juggle the events that had happened earlier. ((Warrior. If only I was just a warrior but no, I get the ultimate curse fate yaddie yadda.)) By this time, i was out of the duo's sight as a red dot appeared on my chest. I rolled quickly into an allyway as a hole appeared where I once stood. ((Just a ordinary night on the town.)) I withdrew an RPG90 as my red night vision took over. ((Only seven? that's no fun.)) I aimed carefully, my eyes acting like a scope as they widened. I hummed the tune of &quot;Lies&quot; lightly as I pulled the trigger. The rewarding scream beckoned me to move onto the other six. I used walljumps to get onto the roof as the surprised guard stumbled back. I flipped with ease and in a handstand position, my legs wrapped about his neck and snapped it like a twig. I moved quickly as a stream of metal hit the fallen man. I withdrew the double machine guns Zil had given to me and shot in four different directions. I holstered my weapons and jumped down into another alleyway as the four heavy thuds rang in my ears. ((One more.)) I headed silently off in the direction of the last guard. He kept slamming on his transmitter for a response from the other six. I made sure he was the last one left and no one else was about. I came up from behind, leaping from the ground to the roof. In two movements, his arms were broken and his gun clattered to the ground. I grabbed his neck so he could barely breathe and his screams were mere whimpers. I removed my hood and made his tilt his head to the left. My eyes turned crimson as I felt myself loosing control rapidly. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Destroy him...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> My canines extended into massive fangs as I prepared to drain every last drop of blood from his body.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hotaru! Where are you?!&quot; Fearix's yell snapped me out of the demonic trance as I quickly snapped the guard's neck, dropping his lifeless body to the ground. I kept my mouth closed, concealing the fangs as he landed beside me. He glanced at the body then to me. &quot;Having fun?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Loads.&quot; I replied sarcastically as I pulled the hood over my face once again. The fangs slowly retracted to the normal size canines as my eyes faded purple. ((I don't know how much longer I can hide this from everyone. As if the bone spikes in my right wing weren't hard enough to explain!..ugh)) <br>
<br>
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing.&quot; I tossed him the bag of money. &quot;Go have your own fun.&quot; He quickly disappeared, off to do whatever he wished with the money I had 'earned'. I sighed and walked off the rooftop, landing gracefully on the ground.

((Probably back in the casino.)) I slipped into the crowd unnoticed and watched as the two went into the karaoke section. I stifled my laughter. ((I gotta see this.))

<br>
&quot;What the-&quot; He fell unconsious as I examnied him carefully. ((Little big, but it'll fit.)) I walked out of the closet and adjusted the sunglasses. My hair was kept in a firm bun and my clothes were stuffed in the closet's corner. I turned off the radio and walked into the section. There, Leon was trying to convince Zil to sing on stage. I came up beside them.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you're gonna try to get Zil to sing, good luck.&quot; Zil smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're gonna get caught one of these days.&quot;<br>

Tacky disco lights illuminated the humble stage and the tune of Utada Hikaru's &quot;Simple and Clean&quot; resounded throughout, immersing the barscene in a spectacular atmosphere of bright lights and peppy technopop (OOC: so cheerful it makes you want to retch, doesn't it? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START |I --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tired.gif ALT="|I"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
The diabolical efforts of Leon and Hotaru were about ready to drag Zil on stage, when all three of them stopped short to stare and roll their eyes as they beheld Nina Inhertz, singing outright in a less than melodious tune.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good God . . .&quot; Zil mutters less than enthusiastically.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zi~l!&quot; Nina waves and calls inbetween the lyrics, &quot;Come sing with me, hun!&quot; motioning for the reluctant assassain to come up on stage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, Zil, go sing with the crazy bitch,&quot; Hotaru remarks, a slight smirk indicates remote amusement.<br>
<br>
&quot;No way . . . she's planning something, I know it-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I said SING, dammit!&quot; Nina interjects, snatching Zil by the arm, dragging her onto the stage, whilst shoving the microphone into her face.<br>
<br>
It was certainly an interesting sight to witness . . . a sorceress, positively bouncing, and her quietly enraged &quot;partner&quot; murmuring the words barely audiable over Nina's Japanese rendition. Zil's joy could not be expressed in mere words when the song finally concluded, only to have her momentary relief interrupted by Nina's arm swung over the other's shoulder as if they were good friends.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cheer up, hun, you weren't that bad!&quot; she remarked, grinning.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't make me pull my Uzi on you,&quot; Zil replied through clenched teeth.<br>
<br>
Nina only grinned back pleasantly enough and, through her own clenched teeth, replied cheerfully, &quot;Heh . . . hun, if security doesn't get you for threatening me in public I most certainly will kick your ass.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=silverwill>SilverWill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/8/03 8:43:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'm goin' on an ego trip!

I got nothin'.)) I'd like to get my GROOVE on!&quot;<br>
<br>
He jumps on stage and shoves them out of the spotlight. Leon taps the touch screen until he finds the song he likes most out of the huge list. ((OOC: That's how I do it.))<br>
<br>
&quot;Aha!&quot;<br>
<br>
He goes up to the mic and waits until the music starts. Zil finds it to be familiar... but not in a good way.<br>
<br>
Leon starts to sing out. <br>
<br>
&quot;Kelly,<br>
Can you handle this?<br>
Michelle,<br>
Can you handle this?<br>
Beyonce?<br>
Can you handle this?<br>
I don't think they can handle this. WOOOO!&quot;<br>
<br>
Zil, Nina, and Hotaru exchange both horrified and frightened glances.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cuz my body too bootylicious for ya babe!&quot; Leon sings dances along to the music. He doesn't look that bad. In fact, he looks almost hot.<br>
<br>
When he finishes, Leon gets a standing ovation, more so for the fact that somewhere along his routine he had managed to take his shirt off. Leon jumps back down on the floor and slips into his skimpy clothing once again. The trio of ladies has a disturbed look upon it's face. They give him a sarcastic golf clap and a &quot;I'm soooo embarrassed to be seen around you&quot; scowl as well.<br>
<br>
Leon grins and rubs the back of his head. A blonde groupie, fan girl with pig tails bounces towards him. <br>
<br>
&quot;WOOOOOOOOO!Sign my chest!&quot; She pulls down her baby T and shoves a pen into Leon's hand. <br>
<br>
&quot;Happy to oblige!&quot; He signs his name, making sure to take his good damn time, and returns to the group.   <br>

<br>
After Nina has finally ceased her enthusiastic clapping and insanely assertive demands for Leon to &quot;take it all off&quot; (whilst the two women beside her responded to her antics with blank stares), the sorceress grinned and hooked an arm around Leon nonchalantly. &quot;Excuse us a sec . . .&quot; she interjects, winking and leading the mildly pleased man out into the lobby.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd give them five minutes before we see what she's up to,&quot; Hotaru suggests. Zil nods, both having concluded that something was up with the bounty huntress' suddenly agreeable attitude . . .<br>
<br>
Out in the lobby, the usual crowd of gambler addicts and old ladies at the slots had died down to a minimum. Nina, finally away from the ominous scrutiny of the other two, led Leon behind the cover of one of those tacky plastic palm/plant things.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bit of an obvious spot for a makeout session-&quot; Leon stated, smirking lecherously.<br>
<br>
The sudden, sharp impact of Nina's gloved hand struck across the man's cheek in one swift movement that even the agile aristocrat hadn't time to react.<br>
<br>
Leon takes a small step backward, his look that of annoyance that was only intensified by the bright red mark imprinted on his cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't get the wrong impression, pal,&quot; Nina responded dangerously, wagging a finger. &quot;I still haven't forgiven you for firing me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Understood . . .&quot; Leon replied, regaining his more calm and collected composure similar to when he had first approached her. A presumable amount of tension had already encircled the two as they locked eyes on eachother, neither friend nor foe exactly . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;You said that, when you hired me to find your friend, you'd help me get this bounty off my head,&quot; Nina continued irately, pointing to herself for emphasis, &quot;You said you had information on the guild that was tracking me and you promised you'd employ your group of assassains to dispose of them . . . what I want to know is . . .&quot; <br>
<br>
She paused, clenching her fist . .  Leon could sense an overwhelming haze of anixety surrounding her, which hadn't seemed to appear until now. &quot;You said you say alot of things . . . and, while I consider myself to have a pretty good sense of humor, I intensely dislike those who play with me like their @#%$ pawn . . .&quot; Her eyes narrowed until her pupils seemed inhumanly elogated and slitted, like a caged animal's.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you proposing?&quot; he inquired apathetically.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want you to uphold your end of the bargain,&quot; she stated sharply, &quot;I want my information . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
(OOC: Ano . . . yes . . confusing, but I felt like the RPG needed a twist . .  er, Roman, perhaps I should clue you in on Nina's background in order to finish this &quot;happy&quot; conversation . . . yeah . .  smart move there, Nina . . .

All part of RPing. ^^ </span><hr size=1> Leon smoothes the skin on his cheek back to his hair line. The pain instantly lessens and the red dissipates. His cool, almost cold, composure returns.<br>
<br>
&quot;First off, Sug, it wasn't I that hired you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bull-shi-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me finish. I may be an assassin but I still have work ethic and rules governing my actions. I believe he told you to kill Zil, not find her. You've failed in that aspect. I have discovered her first, another failure. You signed no document, yet another failure. You are comprised of failure and you have the audacity to demand MY attention, MY obedience!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nina glares at Leon. Most of what he has said is correct, except for the failure bit. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am not a failure!&quot; she says.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I am not a doll for little girls to play with.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nina looks shocked at his words. She has nothing to say to that, she just wants to rip him to pieces. The angry woman looks down at the floor, needing a diversion to keep herself from destroying the bastard. <br>
<br>
&quot;He?&quot; she finally asks, halfheartedly.<br>
<br>
&quot;When I lose consciousness my alter-ego takes me over. It's a curse really.&quot; He shifts his weight and raises his chin as if proud of his suffering and pain. He has a right to be, with all that he's done to help the world after doing so much to kill it.<br>
<br>
&quot;But it was still you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It may be difficult for such a young creature, as yourself, to understand this. I will not bother you with the details. I will only repay your monitorial loses.&quot; He begins to walk away but her hand slams into his chest, stopping him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You promised... You promised!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No documentation has been signed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You sound like a freakin' machine!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sometimes it helps to be logical.&quot;<br>
<br>
He brushes her hand aside with composed strength. Nina watches him walk but in her rage she takes a piece of paper from her pocket and slaps it on the back of Leon's head. The marking shine brightly. &quot;You're not getting away that easily.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leon reaches back and takes the bit of paper off his hair. Nina watches, confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;An offuda?&quot; Leon asks, inspecting the object. &quot;Such a primitive type of spell casting, no need to remember. No need to understand or learn. You just use it...&quot;<br>
<br>
Leon's eyes burn into Nina's. &quot;After living as long as I have, you become stone to silly pop religions, beliefs, archaic practices. Things that you do not believe in, that you don't know of, cannot harm you. Even your bloodthirsty sword is dead to me, notice how it does not feel my presence. Perhaps you should try a different spell, one learned, that does not depend on material things.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're giving me advice on how to kill you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Leon tilts his head and closes his eyes; the ofuda crumbles in his hand. &quot;Why not? I do not fear you. You need me to save you. That need does not command respect. If you want my help, you must defeat me.&quot;<br>
<br>
((OOC: Material magic doesn?t work on him. He?s too old and wise to be affected.))<br>

Whatever works. ^^() So yeah. Here we go!)<br>
<br>
&quot;Hamtaru!&quot; Fearix's voice calls out to Hotaru and Zil who are standing amongst the crowd looking very confused. Suddenly, a very infuriated Hotaru turns around.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the @#%$ did you just call me?!&quot; Hotaru nearly shrieks, illuminating a slight purple. Zil puts a hand on Hotaru's shoulder in hopes to calm the madwoman down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hahahaha! Wasn't that funny?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;DIE!&quot; Fearix shrieks and runs off to go gamble his ass off and drink a few glasses of blood as Hotaru stands there trembling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hotaru....&quot; Zil starts, but Hotaru suddenly calms down as she looks up slightly alarmed. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I feel evil.... Hostility.... Overwhelming power....&quot; Zil looks at her confused. Hotaru's hostile stare looks at man walking nearby, sipping a glass of wine very elegantly. Hotaru takes a step back, not breaking her stare at the man. &quot;His aura.... It's sickening.... Worse than ours....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The hell are you talking about, girl?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He's up to something. We best keep our distant for now.&quot; The muscular yet skinny man looks straight at them, revealing two very dark eyes, his pupils barely consisting of any other color besides black, a scar of what almost like stitches going over his left eye. Two long, blueish-silver bangs hang over his face as the rest of his long hair is tied back into a slightly ponytail. He walks forward and passes by Zil and Hotaru almost doing a cheers motion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Life's but a gamble,&quot; the man says in a dark, deep voice and smiles before he continues walking away. Hotaru's trust drains completely.<br>
<br>
&quot;Should we keep an eye on him?&quot; Zil asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah.... But I don't get it. It almost seemed as if two people were there, but there was only one,&quot; Hotaru mumbles.<br>
<br>
&quot;The hell?&quot; <p>They'll never see <br>
I'll never be<br>
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger<br>
Burning deep inside of me<br>
<br>
But through my tears breaks a blinding light<br>
Birthing a dawn to this endless night<br>
Arms outstretched, awaiting me<br>
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree<br>

Zil still had the expression of what-the-hell-were-you-talking-about look on her face. I smiled and waved it off. <br>
<br>
&quot;Forget it. It's nothing but me babbling. Look who's back.&quot; Leon walked back, a bright hand mark lit his face. I cocked a brow. &quot;Well that went well.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What happened?&quot; Zil asked him. I cut in quickly and briefly,<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm off to go look around a bit and probably change costume. Tootles.&quot; I turned and then mingled in the crowd, searching for the gambling boy. ((I can't see above all these people @#%$ it!)) My eye twitched in frustration then I looked back on the stage. I slipped nimbly among the crowd and into the back stage room. I found costume room and different types of outfits. I took off the extremely baggy guard outfit and put on a red dress that had a high tear in the side that showed the black spandex shorts and black leather knee high boots. I kept my hair down as I fixed the straps in the back of the dress. I covered my pointed ears with my hair and most of my eyes with the bangs. I kept the guard's gun in my holster that was strapped to my right thigh. ((Ugh hate singing in front of big crowds.)) I went out of the room and adjusted my black cross that hung limply from my neck. I stepped out on the stage and pressed a few icons to get Evanessence, Bring Me to Life. The lights went a light blueish tone and started to swirl about as I sung to the words, all the while searching for him.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb...&quot; My eyes darted back and forth as I started to think I should've picked a longer song. <br>
<br>
&quot;..Save me from the nothing I've become...Now..&quot; My sensatory system amplified all the sounds about me. Every conversation becoming audible. <br>
<br>
&quot;Frozen inside, without your touch without your love, darling...&quot; ((Goddamnit! Where is he?!))  I let my dark energy slip a little bit so i could track his.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems...got to open my eyes to everything...&quot; My eyes narrowed as I finally spotted him in the back. (bout damn time.))<br>
<br>
&quot;Wake me up inside, wake me upinside. call my name and save me from the dark....&quot; He turned and looked directly at me. A smug smile spread across his dark features as he gave the cheers gesture again. <br>
<br>
&quot;Bring me to life...&quot; I finished the song and placed the mic back in it's holder as the applause came up. I leapt off the stage, gave a slight salute to Zil then bolted from sight to the back of the room towards the man. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Destroy...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I froze in step as I reached the back of the room as my heart began to race. My hands began to tremble as I felt the sheild on my dark energy wearing down. I bit down hard and tried to focus, slowly raising my body upright.

<br>
&quot;Is it still red?!&quot; he asks Zil, slightly irritated. Unless his hyperactive metabolism has suddenly worn off, he should have healed completely. ((OOC: --# *glare* *glare*))<br>
<br>
&quot;What's still red?&quot; Zil gives him a questioning look.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
A shriek is heard from the doors Leon came through. Nina dashes in, sword ready to impale the annoying man. Leon stands in place, unmoved by her voice. Zil looks slightly distressed, as Leon does nothing to dodge or reflect the sharp object.<br>
<br>
As presumed, it stabs him through the left lung ((OOC: that's your left)) and drags upward before retreating. Leon smiles mockingly at the woman. She is breathing heavily and her irritation is growing.<br>
<br>
Zil backs away, knowing what's going to happen next. &quot;Every one, clear out!&quot;<br>
<br>
The gamblers quickly dissipate. Leon doesn't seem to care either way, although internally he's thanking Zil for helping out. This won't be pretty and he doesn't want the innocents to get hurt.<br>
<br>
The blade slashes again, this time at Leon's neck but his hand stops it. Blood dribbles down his wounds and forearm. He edges towards Nina until his lips are within an inch of her ear. His hand is becoming agonizingly painful but it doesn't matter now. <br>
<br>
&quot;You have both condemned proven yourself. I... respect you now.&quot; His voice is slightly sarcastic but still calm. &quot;Now.. Let's see which one of us dies first!&quot;<br>
<br>
With those final words, he falls, dead, to the floor. Nina nudges him with her sword. <br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; she asks no one in particular.<br>
<br>
She doesn't notice the talons sprouting from Leon's fingers or the way his back teeth elongate and sharpen. His eyes become long slits under the lids. Long, green feathers sprout from the back of Leon's head. All this is unknown to Nina as she looks on the confusingly non-living sight.<br>

Zil's gotten to the point in her life where death doesn't mean a damn thing anymore.  <br>
Zil glances down at Leon, seeing him transforming.  It's nothing new to her.  She's known all along it would come to this.  The red mark on his face was still visible, but fading quickly ((OOC:  guess Zil's polite enough to lie, no? heh...)).<br>
&quot;What the hell's going on?&quot;  Nina demands of Zil.  <br>
Zil shrugs.  Nina had it coming...<br>
She glances to the back of the room, Hotaru and the man from earlier seem to be engaged in a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>lovely</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> conversation...Fearix is nearby in case he should be needed.  <br>
Something about the entire situation isn't sitting right with Zil.  Feeling the beast stirring within her, she knows what will happen soon.  She's too tired to fight Nemesis now...<br>
she casually walks over to the jukebox and blasts Linkin Park.  <br>
'So they won't hear me if I scream...'  She thinks and walks out the back door into the dark ally, unnoticed by the others... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninainhertz>Nina Inhertz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/13/03 4:31:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Disturbing entry . . . ??

<br>
(First . .  a quick recap . . . )<br>
<br>
All this time, Nina had been brooding in the lobby, sitting against the wall with her knees drawn to her chin, contemplating the words that this upstart Leon had uttered to her so plainly, so haphazardly. Thus, understandably so, she was slightly infuriated. She wasn't a failure . . . she wasn't useless . . . she meant something, dammit!<br>
<br>
She felt this anger intensify and consume her. Furiously casting a glance at her katana as it stared back, dead to everything, no matter how much her grip on it tightened. <br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT GOOD ARE YOU?!&quot; she couldn't help but scream at it, tossing the slightly unnerved blade against the adjacent wall.<br>
However, she still felt its hold on her, felt its presence wrapped around her palm and curling around her forearm <br>
<br>
&quot;. . . destruction . . .&quot; it commanded, suddenly awakening from its apathetic sleep. An unseen force, perhaps the blade itself, dragged the katana back over to Nina's reclined position.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right then . . . about time . . .&quot; she muttered halfheartedly, grasping the handle. Immediately a surge of that wild blue aura seemed to strike her soul directly.<br>
<br>
She rose and aimed for Leon . . .<br>
<br>
(. . . K, recap done . . . <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
&quot;You're right, Zil,&quot; Nina couldn't help but utter, even though she knew Zil wasn't listening, nor couldn't even perceive her over the insanely loud music, &quot;nothing is immortal . . . except your impact on others . . . suppose that should account for something, huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
She groaned and shook her head, putting thoughts of the temperamental Zil out of focus for the moment, turning to a slowly arising Leon. Even now the transformation was apparent to her. &quot;Whose sore now?!&quot; she sneered, staring down the face of an unhappy psychic.<br>
<br>
The katana resounded with an shriek as its wielder swung it in front of her for emphasis. Nina, for a brief instant, seemed unusually tranquil. A blue flame, originating from the sword itself, flung outwards, encasing the physical blade in an aura of blue, winding and latching itself onto Nina's arm.<br>
<br>
Her eyes seemed unusually sullen and somewhat disheartening, a faint flicker of blue intruding upon her normally crimson red pupils . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine then . . . I condemn myself . . .&quot; she proclaims impassively. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fearixbloodlust>Fearix Bloodlust</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/13/03 6:24:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Disturbing entry . . . ?? Long too -_- . . .</span><hr size=1> &quot;Umbrella did a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>satisfying</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> job with you, I see,&quot; the overpowering man before her says. Hotaru grits her teeth, just barely hiding the fangs.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're avoiding my question. Who are you?&quot; Hotaru continues to ask in her most polite voice. The man smiles gently but with a threatening manner at the same time. He steps forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Such power.... Such anger.... Such a powerful woman yet so weak minded, such lack of control. You have great abilities, and Umbrella even decided to upgrade a few of them I see.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;WHO ARE YOU?! WHO SENT YOU?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who I am is really none of your concern and what I cannot be sent for there is no one left above me.&quot; The man steps forward. &quot;I've heard so much about you.... All that power you harness. One day you'll lose total control, and I'm here to offer you that control that you beg for so much.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't need help from you. You'll never know what goes on in my head!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; An even deeper voice says, echoing throughout Hotaru's mind. Hotaru looks at Savaric confused, for his lips did not speak those words. She looks around her, but no one is there. &quot;The darkness in your heart will lead to your ultimate success.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Goddamned telepath.... I'll show you darkness!&quot; Hotaru's massive wings spread out from behind her as she starts to transform, her canines growing at an incredible rate. She lets a monstrous scream escape from her throat, her fingers becoming pointed, her eyes changing color. The man's smile becomes even greater, to the point where it's almost manaical, enjoying the free show. Hotaru dives right at him, taking her hidden glaive out and attacking relentlessly. The man just holds up one hand, and as if a shield is surrounding him, he blocks each attach and is left scratch free.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe your mistaken,&quot; the man says as she continues to attack, each one being blocked by the barrier around him.<br>
<br>
&quot;We can show you darkness,&quot; the voice echoes in her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;We.....?&quot; Hotaru mumbles confused. The man's arm becomes an inferno suddenly as he shoots fire straight at her in the form of a Phoenix, fire rain falling from the ceiling, and a dark hand coming up from under the ground as if a shadow somehow grasping Hotaru and restraining her. The man shakes his head in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not here to fight you. I'm only here to take you in. We can take you in. We can make you stronger.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bastard.... You're sharing your body with a demon aren't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He has no name such as demon, he's just part of me. Call him... 2nd Half. It's much suitable for his role. Now I'll let you rest to think about my offer.&quot; The shadow squeezes her harder as she chokes out, unable to breath. Electrisity suddenly starts to pour through the hand and shock the woman half to death as she slowly loses conscious.<br>
<br>
&quot;How can it be that I'm-&quot; Hotaru loses all strength to talk, and right before she passes out suddenly recognizes the name '2nd Half' from a massive destruction a long time ago.... Working with a man named Savaric.... And right before she is knocked out cold, she realizes that his left eye is pure black as he right eye is an icy blue color.<br>
<br>
&quot;I never challenge anyone. It's a waste of lives.... I'm too powerful, and I'm willing to train you. Don't come find me. I'll find you.&quot;<br>
<br>
******************************* (Goddamned, this is long)<br>
<br>
Fearix takes a small sip of his fourth wine glass of blood. All the people who had once been at the bar lie dead at the moment, bite marks on all of their necks. Fearix took the liberty of taking over the bar and using their blood for his own personal uses. He licks the fresh blood off his lips as he notices Zil running out back, and then to Leon and Nina who seemed to be pursuing a long battle. With a slight sigh, he leans back in his chair.<br>
<br>
&lt;It's just a fun life living forever. Not even a silver stake can kill me. Guess I can't do anything about being born as the Prince of Darkness and vampires. I save my fun for later times.&gt; Fearix slightly smiles at the thought of taking on the loser of the match, knowing he could never be destroyed. Wounded was thing, but he wasn't afraid of dying, because it would never happen. Just as the thought as ends, the long-haired man from earlier walks out of the room behind the stage, a slight stain of blood on his face, but is quickly removed by a cloth. Fearix starts to follow him, but suddenly feels the overpressing darkness and power within the man before him, and knows that whether or not he could die, it would be a battle not even he could take, and would only end up wounded in the end.<br>
<br>
&lt;Better check out what he was up to.&gt; Fearix casually strolls over to the door marked 'Staff Only.'<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, Mr. Manager, do you think I could come in here. 'Sure, Mr. Wolfgang! Walk right inside!' Danke!&quot; Fearix says to no one in particular, and walks right into the staff room. He looks around at the short hallway, and notices a door slightly ajar, and a small trail of blood leaking out of it. Natural instinct draws him closer as he slowly opens door and suddenly finds a passed out Hotaru Valentine on the floor. Fearix quickly runs over to her side and starts shaking her limp body. &quot;Hotaru? Hotaru! Wake up, dammit! The hell happened to you anyway?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me your....&quot; Hotaru mumbles in her unconscious state. Fearix smacks her across the face, but only finds that it leaves a handprint on her cheek and a scratch from each hunger. He sweat drops, and gets up trying to think of what to do. He couldn't just take her back to the ship for medical use, he had no idea where the Golden Rhino even was, and chances are that Vicky and Gnat would only kill her.... Wait... That can't happen. ^^() Fearix gets an idea, and takes out his communicator, and hits a few buttons that would lead to Zil's communicator on or off no matter what, a code that only Hotaru, Reiban, Kamarii, and himself knew about. The communicator buzzes a few times.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; a very distressed looking Zil says. Something tells Fearix that he was catching her at one of her 'bad times' fighting against Nemesis.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zil.... Don't push yourself, but if you can make it sometime, I could use some help with Hotaru. Something's happened to her, and she won't wake up,&quot; Fearix says. There's a slight silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll come when I can.&quot; The communicator shuts off. Fearix sighs knowing that later could last from then to the next month with Zil. Fearix picks up Hotaru's body and places it on a nearby cot for staff only. Something tells him it was used more or less for sleeping during work.... This <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a casino after all. Fearix just grabs a chair and waits for Hotaru to wake up again while taking a bottle of blood from earlier and starts slowly drinking it to his pleasure. <p>They'll never see <br>
I'll never be<br>
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger<br>
Burning deep inside of me<br>
<br>
But through my tears breaks a blinding light<br>
Birthing a dawn to this endless night<br>
Arms outstretched, awaiting me<br>
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree<br>

<br>
&quot;Hotaru!&quot; Fearix exclaimed as he rushed to my side. My right wings convulsed momentarily as a few black feathers fell but this time, my feathers didn't grow back. Fearix narrowed his eyes at the wing then looked at me. &quot;What the f*ck...&quot; I coughed harshly as blood dripped from the side of my mouth. He placed a hand on my shoulder as I slowly sat up. <br>
<br>
&quot;My body... it keeps changing...&quot; I muttered as I wiped the blood from my chin. &quot;That guy... Savaric...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up and lie back down.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;He's after me, Fearix! He knows who I am. He wants to train me...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Calm down. You're babbling.&quot; I looked up at him as my mind started to take in the full scenario. <br>
<br>
&quot;He can control energy better than I can. His power may be much weaker but he can control and defense are practically flawless. If he gets his hands on me, I'm f*cked. We're all screwed.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Get a hold of yourself. There is no 'Savaric' or anything. You need a rest.... wonder if Zil will show up...&quot; He laid me gently on the table as my limbs began to tremble. ((I've known him before... When? the past... seems like ages ago... different life? He knows me... did he use me before? Did I just imagine everything?)) I shook my head and closed my eyes, exhaling shakily. I felt my bones starting to move and re-arrange themselves as I slipped into unconsiousness once again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zil15>Z I L 15</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FF9300>(4/14/03 3:58:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Savaric reminds me of good yuki/dark yuki. its confusin'</span><hr size=1> Feeling everything inside her begin to tear open and expand, Zil collapses in pain just outside.  <br>
<br>
&quot;This life isn't worth fighting for...&quot; She whispers, closing her eyes, about to give up, about to surrender...<br>
<br>
She feels such pain, such sorrow, such anger and frustration.  <br>
And not at Umbrella at herself.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I should be stronger than this...&quot;  Zil whispers again.  <br>
<br>
Nemesis starts to rip through her skin and she can feel herself slipping.<br>
<br>
Hearing a seemingly distant beeping, Zil tries to focus, to concentrate...her communicator...Why the hell didn't she trash it when she left their Golden Rhino Crew?<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;  Zil breathes out, barely able to speak.  <br>
<br>
Zil.... Don't push yourself, but if you can make it sometime, I could use some help with Hotaru. Something's happened to her, and she won't wake up,&quot; Fearix says. <br>
<br>
Zil doesn't respond right away.  Her mind is racing...<br>
<br>
Fearix...Hotaru...Friends...Something happened...Won't wake up...<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll come when I can.&quot;  Zil coughs ((a month?  i'm not a COMPLETE b*tch...)) and hangs up her communicator.  <br>
<br>
Knowing she's gotta pull through, Zil takes a deep breath and fights to regain control of herself.  <br>
<br>
After a few minutes of struggling, Zil regains control and bursts into a violent coughing fit.  <br>
<br>
After giving herself a moment to gather her strength, she stands and, giving herself the disguise of a calm exterior, she walks confidently back inside.  One would never guess she was the weak, pathetic creature who had just been at war with the beast within herself.  <br>
<br>
Seeing Leon and Nina engaged in a temporary stare down, Zil hurries past them and to Hotaru and Fearix.  <br>
<br>
&quot;She woke up for a sec, then she passed out again...&quot; Fearix explains.  <br>
<br>
Zil nods and kneels at Hotaru's side, &quot;Come on 'Taru.  Wake up.  You can pull through...You always do...You can't leave...We got Fearix here to babysit...&quot;  ((<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

Zil smirks, &quot;You know it's true...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Come on!  If anything, I'm the one that...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Save your breath, Fearix.
