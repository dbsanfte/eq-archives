Author's Note: Response to SamAndJack4Ever's sort-of-challenge about a romance fic for her and Gunny. She mentioned something about wanting to be Gunny's pillow, but I wasn't able to work that in anywhere. Maybe if there's a part 2? ( Also, I know that the show has everyone address people by their proper military titles, but I'm not in the military, and I'm lazy, so it's not like that here.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Gunny came into work, a smile on his face. He greeted Harm, Mac, and Admiral Chegwidden, along with a few others. Then he saw a young woman he didn't recognize talking to Harriet. Harriet gave him a smile, acknowledging his presence, but didn't invite him to join the conversation. He became aware of a voice calling his name and he turned his head. Harm flashed a bright, knowing smile. He chuckled and leaned a little closer toward Gunny, so he could hear him speak in an almost whispered tone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Better not let her catch you staring at her like that. She's liable to take out a restraining order.&quot; Harm walked away, stifling a laugh. Gunny forced down the blush he felt rising to his cheeks in embarrassment. He walked over to Harriet, trying to think of something to say. He grinned and said good morning.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good morning. Have you met Morgan?&quot; He smiled and shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;No ma'am. Not yet. Nice to meet you Morgan.&quot; He extended his hand for her to shake and introduced himself. 'She seems nice, but a little shy for how pretty she is,' Gunny thought to himself. He wanted to ask her all of the typical 'get-to-know-you' questions, but Harriet ushered her out of the office quickly, emphatically stating that 'if they didn't leave now, they'd be late.' He furrowed his brow as they left, not knowing where Harriet and Morgan were headed, or if he would ever even see her again. He headed into Mac's office, where he interrupted what appeared to be another ridiculous argument between Mac and Harm. Mac rolled her eyes, and then she noticed Gunny.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you need something?&quot; She asked politely, but really she didn't want him in there. Arguing with Harm may not have been what she wanted to be doing with him, but at least they were alone before.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, yeah.&quot; He tapped his fingers on the doorframe as Mac looked at him expectantly. &quot;I was just wondering if you knew where Harriet rushed off to.&quot; She shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't even know she rushed off somewhere,&quot; Mac replied honestly. Harm grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;This wouldn't have anything to do with the cute brunette she was speaking with earlier would it?&quot; Mac raised an eyebrow at Harm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Since when do you think brunettes are cute?&quot; He looked over at her and grinned, cocking an eyebrow back at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wouldn't you like to know?&quot; Her eyes grew wide and her mouth dropped open and shut. Gunny was relieved by the foreplay between Harm and Mac, as it was taking his mind off of his own embarrassment by Harm's question. He figured they didn't know where Harriet went or they would have told him, so he left her office without interrupting their banter again.<br>
<br>
About an hour later, Harriet came back in, quickly settling down at her desk. Gunny tried to act non-chalant as he walked over to her. She briefly looked up at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is there something I can do for you Gunny?&quot; She asked, sorting through the papers in front of her. He stood there trying to think of something to say, until she looked back up at him. He shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just wondering where you were off to in such a hurry earlier.&quot; She looked surprised and started stammering.<br>
<br>
&quot;I. I cleared it with the Admiral. he's reporting it as personal leave. Why? Did someone say something?&quot; He grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;It just wasn't like you is all.&quot; She relaxed, reigning in her desire to slap him on the arm for making her worry.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had to get Morgan to the airport,&quot; she replied, once again concentrating on her work. Gunny's face fell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh.&quot; Harriet, not noticing Gunny's defeated tone, continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, it was kind of a waste of time actually. We got there and found out that the airline had rescheduled her flight for this afternoon because of engine trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So why didn't she come back with you?&quot; Harriet shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Impractical. I have a load of work today so I wouldn't have been able to spend time with her, plus I didn't want to take any more time off. And she would have been just as bored sitting around here as she's going to be at the airport.&quot; Gunny frowned, and this time Harriet noticed. &quot;She offered to stay there, she said it would be easier for both of us,&quot; Harriet explained, trying to sound rational, but failing. Gunny shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;You should have at least had someone there to protect her. You know all the recruits and such that go through that airport. She could be in trouble.&quot; Harriet laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Despite her shyness around you this morning, I can assure you that Morgan is quite capable of taking care of herself.&quot; She began typing on her keyboard. &quot;Besides, I think the only reason she was quiet when she met you is because she thought you were cute.&quot; Harriet's palm quickly clasped over her mouth and her eyes grew large. Gunny smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot; She shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, not really. Ha, ha.&quot; Harriet looked down and then back up. &quot;I wasn't supposed to tell you, you can't say anything,&quot; Harriet pleaded. Gunny started laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.&quot; She let out a breath and nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks.&quot; He nodded back and left her working at her desk.<br>
<br>
'Time to ask for some personal time of my own,' Gunny thought, as he walked toward the Admiral's office.<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
When he got to the airport, he realized that he didn't know which flight Morgan was waiting for. He grumbled. 'Should have asked Harriet before I left.' He decided to take a chance and asked the air-hop if he had seen the two women that morning and if he knew where the brunette was headed. He lucked out.<br>
<br>
He quickly headed toward Gate 11-E. 'Kentucky. Geez, just my luck.' He saw her sitting in the waiting area by the gate. He put a smile on his face and walked over to her. She didn't immediately look up from the book she was reading, so he coughed to get her attention. Her brown eyes peered up at him and grew wide when she saw whom it was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, hi. Gunny right?&quot; He smiled and sat down next to her, not waiting for an invitation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah. Sorry about the intrusion, but Harriet felt bad about leaving you here by yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooooh. Yeah, I was wondering why you'd be here.&quot; He grinned mischievously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe I just like you.&quot; She let out a nervous laugh. A tall, good looking blonde man in his early twenties came over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, how's it going?&quot; She just stared blankly at him, hoping he would get the clue to leave her alone, but when he didn't, she responded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not interested. Go away.&quot; She made a shooing motion with her hand and the man sadly walked away. Gunny laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess Harriet was right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;About what?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That you can take care of yourself, that.&quot; he stopped talking when he remembered what he had promised Harriet.<br>
<br>
&quot;That what?&quot; Morgan pressed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Gunny put a faux-innocent look on his face. Morgan blushed and ran a hand over his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;She told you that I thought you were cute didn't she?&quot; He smiled and shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't get mad. If she hadn't let it slip, then I may not have gathered the confidence to come here.&quot; She narrowed her eyes at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought you said she sent you?&quot; He grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, I said she felt bad about leaving you here alone, I just let you imply the rest.&quot; She stared at him disbelievingly.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, so you came here because.?&quot; Morgan's question was cut off by Gunny grazing her lips with his own. &quot;Oh.&quot; She smiled at him. &quot;Okay,&quot; she exclaimed excitedly and quickly pulled his head down for a more passionate kiss.<br>
<br>
