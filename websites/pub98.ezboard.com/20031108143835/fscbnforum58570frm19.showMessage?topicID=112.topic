<br>
Dean was giving Vicious that look again. The "you're a god-damned idiot" look.<br>
<br>
"That whole sentence was in english, Dean. Hey, give me a hand with this chaingun."<br>
<br>
Vicious tugged at the massive weapon, trying to free it from the crate it was inside. Dean made an annoyed sound and easily pulled it out.<br>
<br>
"Thanks! I don't know why Orlock put that on top of all the good guns." Vicious said, pulling out a sniper rifle and checking the scope. <br>
<br>
"Aren't these things usually attached to helicopters?" Dead asked, placing the chaingun in the back of his Explorer.<br>
<br>
"Yes. Yes they are. That's why it goes in the back of your SUV."<br>
<br>
Vicious put on a shoulder-holster that was included in Orlock's "package" and grabbed one of the handguns, placing it in the holster and pulling his jacket onto himself.<br>
<br>
"I think I was asking about how you took that C4 I gave you and rigged the entire club to explode." Dean turned to face Vicious, the same look as before still plastered onto his face.<br>
<br>
"Well, it works like this: if we get into a big fight, I blow the building, the Sabbat burn horribly to death."<br>
<br>
Dean didn't look impressed.<br>
<br>
"So what happens if we DON'T get into a big fight? Are you going to disarm every bomb you placed?" he asked, continuing to not seem impressed. Vicious looked off into the distance somewhere, as though thinking.<br>
<br>
"Well, I don't exactly know how to DISARM a bomb. I just..."<br>
<br>
"YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DISARM YOUR OWN EXPLOSIVES?!"<br>
<br>
Vicious blinked and shrugged.<br>
<br>
"Well, that's why we have SWAT teams, right?" he turned and headed towards the passenger side of the SUV. Dean gave him an annoyed look before opening his garage door and slamming the trunk closed.<br>
<br>
"You'll have to remind me again why I'm working with you, Vish."<br>
<br>
------<br>
11:30pm, PDT<br>
Some club in San Diego. Feel free to name it for me.<br>
------<br>
The place was packed, the place was loud.<br>
<br>
Vicious watched, amused, as the loser frat boy dumped a white powder into the drink he was holding and walked back to the girl he had been speaking to earlier, handing her the drink and smiling expectantly. Vicious made his way behind her and put his hand on her shoulder.<br>
<br>
"So, let me ask you something. Was that powdery substance supposed to add new taste sensations previously unheard of, or is it just flunitrazepam?"<br>
<br>
Blank stares from both.<br>
<br>
"Rohypnol?"<br>
<br>
The frat boy continued stare blankly. The girl, however, frowned at the word and slowly lowered the drink to the table. Vicious rolled his eyes and glared at the frat boy.<br>
<br>
"Let me put this in terms you'll understand. WHY YOU PUT ROOFIE IN DRINK?"<br>
<br>
That shook the kid out of his confused haze and he stood up, shoving Vicious back.<br>
<br>
"What the fuck, man? I didn't do that, you fucking asshole!" the kid sounded pissed off, although Vicious attributed that more to his failed plot than to the accusation itself.<br>
<br>
"Then why don't you take the first drink?" Vicious asked, smiling merrily, filled with joy at the fact that he had just ruined this kid's night. His face slowly became angry as he shoved Vicious again. Vicious noticed that three others had now come up to surround Vicious, boxing him in. The drug-weilding guy smiled.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, now we're going to kick your ass, bitch."<br>
<br>
Vicious allowed him one punch, which he didn't even feel, and then ducked under the next punch just in time to see one of the bouncers grab two of the guys and throw them to the ground. Vicious turned and saw the girl he had just saved while stirring up trouble standing several feet behind the bouncer. Two more bouncers appeared from the crowds and took care of the college kids as Vicious turned and walked to the bar, flipping the bartender one of the fifties that Crowley had given him as "persuasion funds".<br>
<br>
"I'm looking for some guy named Elliot Menucci. I hear he owns the place."<br>
<br>
The bartender pocketed the cash and pointed to a booth on the second level. A second level Vicous wasn't even aware existed. A level, if you will, filled with mystery and excitement. Vicious headed on up, patting the detonator hidden under his jacket for reassurance.<br>
<br>
The second level was more of a game room than anything else. Pool tables, dartboards, shuffleboard, and the like. Sitting at a table, seemingly alone, watching the dance floor below, was a man in an armani suit. A man with no hair. A man with frown lines permanently marring his face. This man turned to stare at Vicious with a discerning look on his face.<br>
<br>
"Can I help you, Mr...." he had a low voice, not unlike Dean's, but with more of an edge to it. That edge being "I'll be happy to kill you now".<br>
<br>
"You're Mr. Menucci, right?" Vicious asked, hoping to avoid geting into a conversation with this guy. The man nodded, his frown deepening. Vicious smiled.<br>
<br>
"Okay, that's all I needed." he said, turning and started walking down the stairs. As he began his descent, out of the corner of his eye he saw Menucci standing, and two other men stopped their game of darts to follow Vicious. Vicious walked down the stairs and was heading towards the exit when the girl he'd helped earlier stopped him.<br>
<br>
"Hi. I didn't get a chance to thank you." she said. she was standing directly in his path. He looked over his shoulder and saw the two vampires AND Menucci making their way through the crowd towards him. He turned back and smiled.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, no problem, and THE BUILDING IS ON FIRE!"<br>
<br>
For some reason, screaming about a building being on fire always causes pandemonium. The desired effect was acheived, however, and panic ensued as people began moving towards the exit. The vampires on Vicious' trail were blocked from reaching him, but Vicious himself was unable to get to the exit through the mass of people. He grabbed the girl and began moving through the crowd, trying to stay next to people taller than he was. It took several minutes, but eventually only a few people remained. Unfortunately, most of those people were the vampires, Vicious, and the girl Vicious was dragging towards the exit. A gun was fired, and a bulet tore through Vicious shoulder. The pain was nearly non-existant, however, and Vicious turned to face his attacker. One of Menucci's lackeys had pulled a gun and was aiming at Vicious. The other was still moving towards him with a smug look on his face. Vicious looked around for a moment, seeing that now most of the clubbers had retreated, and those who remained were now running from the perceived threat of a gunman on the loose. <br>
<br>
"Well, it was worth a shot." Vicious said, suddenly flinging the girl towards the advancing vampire, who backhanded her away, knocking her against a wall and driving her into unconsciousness. Vicious blurred and pulled the detonator from his jacket.<br>
<br>
"Like I said. The place is on fire."<br>
<br>
Beep.<br>
<br>
Explosions tore through the club as the ground shook and the force from the detonation threw Vicious to the ground. He rolled over and admired the destruction he had wrought only for a moment. Standing up, he felt the dark forces inside of him spurring him to flee from the flames that now covered the walls, but he had to make sure no one got out to tattle on him. Charging forward, he grabbed the once-advancing vampire, who had also been knocked down, lifted him up by the back of his shirt, and chucked him into the flames. The vampire began screaming as he caught fire and started the painful process of burning to death. The gun-wielding vampire fired again, this time hitting Vicious in the chest. Again, it had no real effect, as Vicious once again charged forward, this time using his momentum to slam the vampire against a burning wall, where his hair promptly burst into flames and he began screaming like the first, frantically beating at his head with his hands to extinguish the flames. He flailed back into the wall, where his clothing was ignited. <br>
<br>
Menucci was not amused.<br>
<br>
As Vicious charged yet again, he caught Vicious by the neck and threw him back onto the ground, kicking him as he started to get up and knocking him down yet again. Vicious realized that this would be a losing battle. This guy was stronger than Stein, and Stein had given him a serious run for his money. Vicious rolled back and turned towards the exit, preparing to run...<br>
<br>
...when he saw the girl lying there, the flames getting dangerously close...<br>
<br>
The urge to run was overriding his own judgement. He looked back at Menucci, who was advancing, rage burning in his eyes. He looked at the girl again, lying there, with no hope for survival.<br>
<br>
<i>God DAMNIT!</i><br>
<br>
Vicious turned, pulled out his gun, and began firing as he moved towards her, striking Menucci twice. The shots didn't seem to have any discernable effect, but Menucci did halt for a moment to duck under the rest of the shots. This gave Vicious time to throw the girl over his shoulder as he emptied the rest of his clip in Menucci's general direction. He then burst into full speed, reaching the exit just as Menucci stood once again and began running at him. <br>
<br>
Vicious heard sirens nearby and saw the SUV parked down the street. The sidewalk across the street was packed with people watching the inferno take down the club. Vicious shifted the girl so that she was blocking his face, hunched slightly, and ran towards the SUV, with Menucci following. <br>
<br>
The SUV roared to life as Vicious approached and he ran to the back, opening the trunk and tossing the girl inside. He slammed the door shut and went to his side of the car, where Menucci's fist greeted his face, knocking him back a good ten feet and causing him to skid along the pavement, cracking his skull against the sidewalk and momentarily blinding him. He jumped up despite the injury and ran towards Menucci, attempting to duck past him. No such luck, as Menucci clotheslined him and launched him into the air, slamming him into a wall, which cracked under the impact. Vicious slid down and shook his head. Standing up, he saw the trunk of the SUV fly open, revealing Dean weilding the chaingun and wearing a ski-mask over his face.<br>
<br>
Vicious ducked.<br>
<br>
Menucci began spasming violently as bullets tore through his entire body, ripping him open and throwing him to the ground. When the bullets stopped coming, Vicous ran at Menucci, throwing HIM over his shoulder and this time leaping directly into the back of the SUV as Dean dragged himself back into the driver's seat. Vicious grabbed at one of the stakes he probaly should've brought with him into the damn club and smashed it into Menucci's heart, finally slumping down to the floor of the trunk and laughing.<br>
<br>
"Yes! I captured Stein's boss! I fucking rock!" he yelled. Dean made an irritated noise.<br>
<br>
"No, you got your ass kicked by him while I got the gun ready, so I think I captured him," he said. Vicious shrugged, unable to argue with that logic and faced the girl. She was barely breathing, and blood was oozing out of the back of her head.<br>
<br>
<i>Shit. That wasn't how I meant for things to go....</i><br>
<br>
"Is that chick one of his vampires?" Dean asked as he wheeled around a corner, blatantly ignoring speed laws.<br>
<br>
"No... she's... uhhh..."<br>
<br>
<i>Well, I can't just take her home or anything. She saw my face, and if she DOESN'T die, I'm fucked.</i><br>
<br>
Vicious looked at her again.<br>
<br>
<i>And if I hadn't stopped that frat boy, she wouldn't have come to thank me, and she wouldn't have been in the way, and I could've gotten out faster.</i><br>
<br>
He rolled her onto her back.<br>
<br>
<i>And if I hadn't thrown her at that vampire, she might've gotten away and assumed it was some gang war like everyone else is going to.</i><br>
<br>
He rolled up his sleeve and pulled out one of his knives.<br>
<br>
<i>I can't believe I'm going to do this.</i><br>
<br>
"Well, Vish? Who is she?"<br>
<br>
<i>God.... DAMN it!</i><br>
<br>
"She's my new ghoul."<br>
<br>
<i>Mental note: Get girl's name...</i><br>
