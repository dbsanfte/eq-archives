<br>
I do think that some people have a natural tendency to be attracted to people of the same sex.  BUT, I do believe it is as much an aborition as a person who is attracted to children.  The main difference being adults who consent to it are not being abused like a child victim of pedophilia.  But I do not think it is a natural behavior.<br>
<br>
Second, every person that I personally know that is gay, (and I have had the opportunity to work very closely with many gay individuals at work) including my cousin and the brother of my friend EVERY single one of them were sexually abused as children.   I heard a statistic (and unfortuately I cant recall where) anyway the stat was that 60% of gay individuals were molested as children.<br>

It is very rare to find anyone who is 100% at either end of that spectrum and what we tend to be is attracted to whatever we are chemically and biologically oriented for.  Then enter socially acceptable behavior and social programming.  Over the basic layer of orientation lies the social programming we go through as we are raised in our various cultures.  Consequently, you see many more polarized stances on gender orientation.  Men are so steadfastly manly and male and masculine and the stigmata of homosexuality is so stern, that it is only those people who are so strongly oriented at the base level they can’t repress it who allow it to be expressed.  Women are less rigidly constrained socially so you see more hugging and kissing across their population with fewer raised eyebrows.  An actress can do same sex intimate scenes and guys cheer and no one questions the woman after when she says “I am straight, it was only acting” yet the reverse could never be true for a man.  In classical Greek culture there was not the same taboo that exists today and there was a more socially pervasive expression of homoeroticism than you find now.  This supports the idea that it is not so strong biologically as it is culturally.<br>
<br>
Would I let a homosexual watch my kids?  Only if they passed all the same tests I would subject anyone else too.<br>
<br>
Would I be upset if a gay man taught my kids?  Only if he were so indiscrete about it in a way that I would find objectionable if a straight person did.  (Kissing goodbye at the car when dropped off for school is fine, making out in the lunch room is not, I don’t care what your orientation is.  Having a picture on your desk of you and your family is fine, the latest spread in Undergear isn’t…except maybe in sex ed?)<br>
<br>
Would I vote for identical candidates politically?  I’d vote for the gay guy.<br>
<br>
Would I vote for one I shared views with over a straight one?  Every time.<br>
<br>
Would I leave a doctor if he were gay or a straight female?  Only if s/he were unqualified, I am not particularly concerned with who sees me naked, doctor or not.  If she needs to play ‘hello kitty’ between patients, that’s her concern not mine, so long as she washes her hands. <br>
<br>
Question for Candy:  You admit you have hang-ups over the orientation issue, I respect that you can admit that and I endorse your right to choose based on what you are comfortable with.  My question is, what values will you instill in your children regarding this and how would you handle it if you found out they were gay?  I ask this because you concede your difficulty and it may be that you are unable to change your own view, but your children are not set in stone yet and how you raise them will shape the world I am raising mine into.  I want that world to just not care either way if they are gay or black or short or republican.  (This same question applies to anyone who expressed discomfort over the orientation issue.)<br>

Who they choose to sleep with isn't any of my business.  My husband is 18 inches taller than me.  If society decided that husband and wife could only have a height difference within 3-6 inches, then I would give them the finger and tell them I will marry who I want to marry.  Our marriage isn't any of their business, anymore than it is my business who my son's teacher decides to marry.  Homosexuality does not equal perversion or pedophilia.  Most acts of pedophilia are committed by heterosexual males.  It isn't about the sex, much the same way rape isn't about sex.  I accept people based off of the content of their character, not based off of color, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  I plan to teach my son to be the same way.  This is why I won't be putting him in Boy Scouts.  I refuse to let him be part of a group that discriminates.  And why do they discriminate?  Because they are ignorant of the reality surrounding homosexuals, and I would think people would have learned something after finding out that black Americans were human beings and not unfeeling animals worthy of nothing more than a life of servitude.  People just don't learn.  They repeat the same mistakes over and over again.  People don't retell stories of slavery and the Holocaust because they make neat campfire stories.  They tell them so future generations could learn from these mistakes.  I have no doubt that someday scientists will locate the gene that proves homosexuality is not a &quot;choice&quot;.  When this happens, then society will change its tune.  Some people say they don't like homosexual behavior because it is too hard to explain it to their kids.  Well, I say bring it on.  Let my son see two men holding hands in public so I can start the education process.  Education is the key to eliminating discrimination and bigotry in all its forms.  We can't educate our children if we are hiding those that are different behind closed doors and away from our schools and public emporiums.  <br>

I find these questions interesting because I am trying to think about how I bring my sexuality to my job.  I don't.  There is no room in the curriculum for me to discuss it.  While I understand and agree that sexuality is a part of you that you can't leave at home, I don't think that people bring it to their jobs.  I am remembering my gay friend that taught for two years before leaving that profession for law school.  He was too busy teaching science to discuss himself.  A job is a job.

Do all male DR. get off when they are giving you a pelvic. That would be like saying that if I saw a mans penis I just wouldn't be able to help my self I would have to hop on.

I have had many gay friends that are awesome people. That I would trust with my life. I personally don't think it matters what  a persons sexual preference is. That doesn't make the person. I wish we could take all of the judgmental people of the world and replace them with gay people. At least this world would be a less uptight place to be.<br>

I've read a lot on the socio/biological &quot;reasons&quot; for homosexuality, and have never heard this stat. I would seriously question its validity.  <br>
<br>
I have, however, read studies that show that the majority of sex offenders were molested as children;  are you sure this was not what you were thinking of?<br>

<br>
I think DBC has the right of it though. That we all cover a spectrum of straight to homosexual. I did experiement in college and a little afterwards. And I discovered something about myself in the process. I am aroused by both men and women, however, with women is more getting off because I was getting them off. My reaction to men is much stronger and more lasting. <br>
<br>
I do think it is very big conceit that straight people think that when they find out an aquantance is gay that they must be lusting after them. <br>

Where exactly does god command against homosexual behavior?  Also, you answered half my question about how you are raising your son, but not the other half about what you do when you find out he is gay.  I think teaching that it is wrong but we have to be nice is in line with the submission reasoning of all being equal but some are more equal, so I see the same flaws there.  You cannot find peace and acceptance so long as you are superior and right and they are deviant and wrong.  For your whole family’s sake, I hope he is straight.  I have seen the scars that are left when nature meets fundamentalism.<br>

You said it perfectly. <br>

This is one of the main reasons  that I could never get into the bible. It teaches you how to be a well meaning bigot. You spread hatred under the guise of God's love and plan for mankind.<br>

Though, on the gyn/ob thing...well, from what I understand from friends who work in that field...it's like, say, you work with spaghetti all day. Do you really want spaghetti for dinner when you get home? KWIM?

ITA. It is this approach that gives some xians the idea that they are &quot;loving you right up to heaven&quot; by &quot;showing you the error of your ways.&quot; By this way of thinking, it is &quot;unloving&quot; to accept or condone homosexual (or other biblically &quot;unacceptable&quot;) behavior because that doesn't &quot;show the person what they need to do to have salvation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sigh.<br>
<br>
DBC, as far as where the bible condemns homosexual behavior, I have found that some xians can quote you the chapter and verse where it seems to do so, while they conveniently dismiss the other verses in those SAME chapters condemning their own behavior. I'm thinking of Lev. 18:22 (shall not lie with a male) vs. Lev. 18:19. (shall not touch your wife during her period or for 7 days afterwards.) Lev. 18 concludes that these acts are an &quot;abomination&quot; and does not set forth one as a greater sin than the other.  So how do they get from this that homosexuality = sin but never make hubby wait a full 7 days after af.<br>
<br>
I went around with them about this on Babycenter months ago... seems they think Christ nullified all the OT laws that were inconvient to THEM but somehow maintained all the OT laws that seem to condemn our homosexual brethren.&gt;D <br>

<br>
My apologies for missing the second half of your question.  I will be honest with you and tell you that I don't even think about him coming to me telling me he is gay.  Sorry if it is unacceptable to you or anyone else, but he's not going to be raised thinking that homosexuality is okay if &quot;that's who you really are&quot;, because I don't believe it is the way any of us were created.  We were created to be together male and female. That was the example set forth at creation.  <br>
<br>
Yeah, I know, it's an unpopular opinion...call me intolerant, call me a bigot, call me whatever name you want.  Just because one may have homosexual desires doesn't mean one is obligated to fulfill them.  <br>

 What would you call me if I said I would not want a black teacher for my kids. Or I would never want a black gyno because studies show they cant control their sexual desire? I am sure plenty of you would have real problem with me saying that. That is what your saying sounds like to me. Just plain craziness.<br>
I find it so interesting that when the religious people on this board are challenged they often say &quot;I am just human I do not claim to know what god's plan is&quot; but when it comes to judging people you are suddenly god's voice.<br>

Your tone is indicative of offense at my counter-position.  Let me assure you I have deep respect and admiration for you.  You have a wonderfully facile mind and I respect that.  Furthermore, you at least take the time to investigate your faith and learn the apologetics of its doctrine while so very many others blindly swallow and accept what they are told.  I respect and admire that.  You are a fundamentalist who is not a Fundie, and that ain’t easy to pull off.  Please do not take my disagreement with the arguments as disparagement of the woman who presents them.  Without you to speak for them, the other team has no avatar, only drive by doctrine grenades and scripture snipers.  <br>
<br>
Having gay members in my family; having worked with many gay members in the community; having gay friends who we just don’t get to see enough of (yes, I am jealous of their lifestyle sometimes) I have seen that it is not so simple as a choice to act or not.  It is a basic human drive to love, just like yours or mine.  Also just like yours or mine, they did not choose what it was that sets them off for their partner, nature did that and at so fundamental a level it is irrefutable, irresistible and undeniable.  True love is beautiful, no matter where it is found.<br>
