Only the distant sounds of his son getting into things that he probably shouldn't be getting into stirred him from his wife's breast.  He called Declan into his office and he came running, bumping into the doorjam in his haste.  There was a sightly guilty look on the boy's face, but for now HF let it go with a frown.  The boy looked slightly more guilty before heading straight for his mother's open arms.<br>
<br>
HF smiled at the two of them as he sat behind his desk and gazed at the screen long enough to determine that a document had just recently been encrypted.  HF entered the code and began to read.<br>
<br>
Cait had managed to get all the information he had asked for along with several parts essential for weapons repair and some less than edible rations.  Edible or not they would serve to keep some of the weaker ones from being denied food so that the rest could go on.  Many owed Caitriona their lives and they would never know it.<br>
<br>
Looking up he saw that Cait must have sent Declan back out again while he was absorbed in her report.  Usually focusing on anything to the exclusion of all others was a luxury a Nietzschean could ill afford, but HF knew he could trust Cait completely.  She was one of the very few in which he had absolute trust.<br>
<br>
He was about to comment on the report when the console in front of him began to flash.  A moment later his speculatative smile turned into a minor scowl.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Instead, they would dine in the smaller, better decorated, Captain's Hall.  The table would seat twenty adults comfortably, twenty-five if they were willing to enjoy each other's company closely.  With Terri to watch them, the children could dine and play in the Captain's Garden and Observatory connected to the Hall.  Aquaculture production continued to improve.  The menu would include several types of fish, as well as lobster and crab.  Lots of small red potatoes and corn on the cob boiled in spices and a large salad of freshly harvested greens, creole tomatoes, onions, radishes and carrots would complement the main course, all courtesy of aeroponics.  She would round out the menu with some freshly baked bread, also from grains grown in aeroponics, and honey.  The bees, at least, were busy and happy.  For dessert, she would offer her guests loads of fresh fruit and jello blocks for the children.  Food was much more fun when you could play with it.  Sunyata started to remind the Hetu to harvest and prepare some lemons for the seafood.  Instead she gave a small smile as the ship anticipated her desire.  Despite the experience of her melding, the Hetu sometimes managed to surprise her with its ability to act exactly as she would.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Since you seem to have the dining arrangements under control,&quot; Sunyata told the Hetupratyaya, &quot;I'm headed to engineering lab one to test the cloaking boosters.  I don't want our gift to fail the Tyrants.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My development and testing was as thorough as yours will be.  I didn't miss anything,&quot; the Hetu protested.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not suggesting that you erred.  I just want to be tactually familiar with them for description and installation purposes.  Unless you were planning on installing them on the Sardaria and the Ferocitas Invictus yourself,&quot; Sunyata teased her ship.<br>
<br>
As she strode toward the engineering lab, Sunyata asked the Hetu about security arrangements for the dinner.  &quot;All labs, shops and bays will be locked and electronically barred for the duration of the Tyrant visit,&quot;  the Hetu replied.  &quot;The Tyrants can travel the ship freely with you or the XO.  They will not be permitted to enter essential areas unescorted until you grant them clearance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once in the lab, Sunyata tested the cloaking boosters.  Made of strong, lightweight materials, the boosters looked like small metal spheres.  Once installed their unassuming appearance would make them difficult for any enemy to discover.  &quot;You do quality work, Hetu,&quot; Sunyata told her ship as she headed back to her quarters.  <br>
<br>
She changed into a pair of tight, but flexible, black pants and tucked the ends of a button-down, black silk shirt into the pant's waistband.  Then she sat, twirling the cloaking boosters in her fingers, and meditated briefly on the concept of quality while she awaited LT's notification that their guests had arrived.  Master Lao maintained that &quot;The quality of an abode is in its location, / The quality of the heart is in its depths, / The quality of giving lies in trust, / The quality of correct governance lies in orderly rule, / The quality of an enterprise depends on ability, / The quality of movement depends on timing.&quot;  The All willing, her timing was right and trusting the Tyrants enough to give them the cloaking boosters was the correct move.  <br>
<br>
Her Hetupratyaya was in pristine condition and twice the size of the Tyrant ships.  Even standard Wolverine battleships were widely known for their structural integrity, maneuverability, defenses and armaments; but the Hetupratyaya exceeded them.  The Hetu was a colony class battleship.  Sunyata's was only the thirteenth such ship ever christened on her homeworld.  This mission represented a vast expenditure of Wolverine resources.  At a time when no other pride offered support to the Tyrants, her help would likely be met with suspicion.  Nevertheless, help she would, presuming she could discover where she stood with the remnants of the pride.  Whether the Tyrants wanted her help made little difference.  As far as Wolverine pride was concerned, this little band of Nietzscheans was her albatross.  <br>

Cait took him to his room and helped him get out of his muddy clothes, knowing exaclty where he had been and how much fun he had had getting so dirty.. The boy did love his dirt.. <br>
<br>
Once out of his soiled clothing, she scooted him off to take a bath.. While he bathed, Cait prepard something for him to eat and included a plate for HF as well.  HF worked too hard and neglected his own comforts, not just some of the time, but most of the time.<br>
<br>
Declan finished his bath about the same time that Cait finished the meal preparation... and she could see that dressing himself was almost a feat he could preform with no help at all.  She restrained the impluse to re-button his shirt.. what did it matter as long as he was happy and had done it himself.<br>
<br>
Trying to jump up to the table in that incredibly awkward toddler way, he grabbed on to the seat of the chair and pulled himself up, letting his legs swim in the air until he finally made it up to a sitting position....... Laughing Cait said.....</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

XT was too good a survivor and had already survived situations that would have killed an ordinary Niet, and she just knew in her heart they would find him or he would find them. Failure was not an option in this instance.<br>

<br>
&quot;There is a principle that even if it is not one's own thing, that does not hinder giving.  It doesn't matter how insignificant the thing is--the principle is that the effort must be genuine.  When one leaves the Way to the Way, one attains the Way.  When attaining the Way, the Way is necessarily being left to the Way.  When goods are left to goods, the goods unfailingly become giving.  Self gives to self, other gives to other.  The causal power of this giving reaches afar, throughout the heavens and human world, and even reaches the realized sages and saints.  The reason for saying this is that, having become the recipient of giving and having formed an affinity, the Buddha said on this account, 'When a person who gives comes into a group, the people first look at that person.  Know that heart implicitly comes across.'  Therefore one should give even a single phrase or a single verse of the teaching.  It becomes a good seed in this life and other lives.  One should give even a single coin or a blade of grass of resources--it causes roots of goodness in this age and other ages to sprout.  Teaching too is treasure, material resources too are teaching.  It must depend on the will and aspiration . . . What is difficult to transform is the mind of living beings:  This giving is to intend, from having put forth a single chattel and thus begun to transform the mind of living beings, to transform it even so far as attainment of enlightenment.  In the beginning, it must be done by giving.  For this reason in the beginning of the six transcendent ways is the transcendent way of giving.  One should not calculate the greatness or smallness of the thing.  Nevertheless, there is a time when the mind transforms things, and there is giving in which things transform the mind.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Dogen's words ran through Sunyata's mind her state shifted and she began to assimilate the patterns revealed.  Knowing no altruism which did not reflect self interest, Nietzscheans always wanted to know what strings attached the gift to the giver.  Causality, enlightenment, effort, transformation, aspiration, will, affinity, consubstantiality . . . all played a role in the part of her giving.  She considered how this reminder from the All could help her approach the Tyrants during their upcoming gathering.  <br>

She would be seeing her for the first time since their journey began. Knowing that had Sunyata not found her when she did would have separated them forever brought unwanted tears to her eyes. She had been extremely close to her sister wife, to the point that XT would have them both in his bed at the same time and they had enjoyed those times immensely. She knew that her and Orion's deaths would have hit Sca very hard. Now she couldn't wait to greet her and spend some time with her.<br>
<br>
Looking through her few clothes that she had managed to pack, she chose a stretchy catsuit in jet black and pulled on a purple crinkle skirt over it. She grinned as she remembered how Sca would tease her about her passion for that particular color. Her only jewelry was the purple stone necklace her father had given her before sending her away on her 10th birthday. She never took that off, no matter what color she was wearing. Pulling on a pair of black ankle boots, she was almost ready. Makeup was unnecessary, she wasn't advertising herself. Pulling her hair back into a neat french braid was the last thing, then she was ready.<br>
<br>
Leaving Orion with Terri, she strode back onto command and asked for updates. Everything was quiet, so she sat at her station and scanned communications for anything, you never knew if you might come across more of the pride drifting about. She figured she would stay in command until time for dinner, it wasn't like there was much else she could do besides twiddle her thumbs anyway, she thought with a wry smile.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#001B55><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=galadrial@slipstreambbs12353>Galadrial</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#96ab24, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Jeath</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/27/03 12:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Displaced ~ Tyrant RP (Rated R)</span><hr size=1> Tamyra was one of the few people, judging by the looks of the others in Command who actually was looking foreward to the dinner she and the crew had been invited to.

Placing her hand on an architectural element on the wall of her office, she felt the sharp prick of DNA sampling and a portion of the wall melted away.  Sunyata entered the secret access tunnels and made her way rapidly to the Captain's AI interface.  She rolled up the cuffs of her shirt, released her boneblades, melted into the couch and expanded her consciousness as the Hetu responded seamlessly to her sudden urgency.  The download commenced and Sunyata knew without asking the ship's complete status and the Hetu absorbed Sunyata's thoughts about the Dogen fragment.  <br>
<br>
The Hetu finally manifested herself visually and said, &quot;They haven't responded to your invitation.  They may not even come.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sunyata snorted.  She couldn't get under her own skin that easily.  &quot;Let the All's will be my will,&quot; was her only acknowledgement of the ship's taunt.  &quot;I see you completed the dinner preparations.  What's your assessment of our new XO's feelings regarding our invitation?&quot;<br>
<br>
Now it was the Hetu's turn to snort.  &quot;Take a trip to command and see for yourself.  I think it's pretty obvious.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sunyata gave a sharp laugh.  &quot;I take it you have everything you want from me then and I'm dismissed until you have further need of me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Touchy, touchy,&quot; the Hetu snapped back.  &quot;I'd bet the upcoming exchange would transpire more smoothly if you could bring yourself to relax a little.  The heart will tell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sunyata gave a little nod as she detached herself from the Hetupratyaya.  She retracted her boneblades and unrolled and re-buttoned the cuffs of her shirtsleeves.  Exiting the Captain's AI interface the same way she entered it, Sunyata then left her cabin and proceeded through the ship's corridors to Command.  <br>
<br>
Entering Command, Sunyata smiled at her XO.  Her own clothes were designed for functionality and comfort; but Sunyata was pleased to see her XO's choice of more festive attire.  The woman looked forward to seeing her family again and with good reason.  The All willing, she would find a way to gift her XO with more such interaction.  She hoped again that the other captains would bring their children with them.  Though she knew it would be difficult for them to trust her enough to risk it, Orion seemed terribly lonesome.  She might be wrong; but she didn't think he had seen any of his pridemates since LT and his separation from the rest of the family when matters came to a head on Idun.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You look great,&quot; Sunyata told her XO.  &quot;I bet you can hardly wait to see your family again.  Any response to our invitation yet?  Will our guests arrive soon?&quot; she queried.  <br>

<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>It was a dark room lit only by candles and filled with chanting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Cuimhne cuimhne  Lassair ícaim cuimhne  Geal ícaim ícaim cuimhne.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Twelve priestesses, not Wayists, some other obscure sect stood around her anointing her with oils. The room had a heady, smoky air to it from burning herbs with a very unusual smell. <br>
<br>
A priestess passed her a cup and bade her drink. Curious as to it's contents she dubiously consumed the bitter tasting liquid but was relieved when all twelve priestesses did the same.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Cuimhne cuimhne  Lassair ícaim cuimhne  Geal ícaim ícaim cuimhne.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
The chanting got louder, faster. LM began to feel very light-headed and as though she were on fire. Then pictures of her homeworld, her mother, father and the other wives, her siblings, half siblings and cousins, her children, Caer, Morrigan, Cahan, and that little boy who was only a baby when she disappeared.......... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Cuimhne cuimhne  Lassair ícaim cuimhne  Geal ícaim ícaim cuimhne.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
The chanting was reaching a crescendo now and she was beginning to feel connected, the strangest feeling that she could just reach out with her mind and touch anyone of those who mattered to her, call to them and they would hear her. And then the chanting stopped and finally it happened. She could picture another darkened room and a child being taken out of her. Suddenly she sprang up off the bench on which she'd been lying, scattering herbs and oils everywhere, stood up and proclaimed loudly:<br>

LoP stood up and moved around the quiet bridge. The ship was designed for a crew of six, but it could be ran by LoP alone. He stopped and poured himself a cup of coffee, one of the few Earth delights he liked, and sat back down in the command chair.<br>
<br>
The black knight was the answer, but how to get him to make the right moves? That one was very untrusting but had great strength of character, something LoP repsected in him. <br>

At least she'd had the chance to say something to Ian before he went off to join the other teens in the defense of the compound. Now her third son and many of XT's other progeny were dead.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;">'Stop It!'</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> she said to herself brusquely as she reached down to finish nursing her three month old daughter Lea. She had this one and the others to think about now. It was not the time to panic; and she would not allow herself to do that. No, she was her father's daughter and she would not panic.<br>
<br>
The small shuttle had taken heavy battle damge and she had to find another of the survivors of the last attack that had sent them fleeing. She just had to, and fast! She placed the now sleeping infant in the basket that was securely fastened to the support behind her pilot's chair and called for the baby's sister Valeria to assist her. <br>
<br>
They would find the assistance they needed before the shuttle broke up. They would survive, no other outcome was acceptable.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anastashia>Anastashia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.e-cadfael.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/images/Page_6/565.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 2/28/03 8:55:01 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lt@slipstreambbs12353>LT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#de2fae, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>I just came for the cookies</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/28/03 1:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Displaced ~ Tyrant RP (Rated R)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:gray;font-size:x-small;">LT looked up as Sunyata spoke. &quot;Thank you for the compliment.&quot; She said smiling. &quot;I have to get away from the uniforms every now and then, what do you expect from a clothing designer?&quot; She added, grinning wryly. &quot;You could probably use a few tailored things yourself, a change from uniforms, if you please.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have just received confirmation from all who were invited, they should be here shortly. I can't wait to see Sca. We were very close, like sisters.&quot; She told Sunyata. &quot;I don't know how many of them will bring their children, but Terri has everything ready, just in case.&quot;<br>
<br>
Finishing her report, she excuses herself to go see Orion one more time before dinner. She needed some time to think, to work through the memories of that last time before they left Idun. She had helped Sca train the teenagers and she led one band, and Sca had led the others. Though they all fought well, they were no match for the Argonas. She had been lucky enough not to have been seriously wounded before her small band had perished and had made her way to the freighter after bidding XT goodbye. Terri was already there with Orion, waiting for her and they had taken off. They took a hit from an Argona fighter before it was destroyed by one of the Tyrants. They had been able to slipstream, but they had developed a leak and were losing life support. Shutting down all unnecessary functions, she was able to extend their time before losing all life support entirely, Then the Hetupratyaya had tractored them into its cargo bay before she, Orion and Terri had suffocated. Luckily, none of them had any permanent damage from the lack of oxygen.<br>
<br>
Holding her son and rocking him, she thought about Sunyata's rescuing them. She didn't think there was any ulerior motive in her actions, LT had nothing that the woman would want, at least she didn't thinks so.<br>
<br>
That was one of the reasons that LT figured that they could trust Sunyata, she had never observed any underhanded behavior from her, but being naturally reserved, had still been cautious about trusting her implicitely.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lt@slipstreambbs12353>LT</A> at: 2/28/03 5:47:51 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=13.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=13.topic&start=41&stop=49>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=13.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=13.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.emailToFriend?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.threadControl?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="slipstreambbs12353frm17">Announcements<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm24">The Underground Wire<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm18">General Discussion<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm7">Episodes<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm8">Andromeda Universe<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm13">Fan Fiction<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm25">Challenge Forum<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm15">Filk<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm12">Roleplaying<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm14">Web Sites<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm11">The Observation Deck<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm22">The Abyss<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm10">Science Fiction & Fantasy<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm19">Chat Room<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm20">Questions, Suggestions, and Feedback<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm9">Tech Questions<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm16">Officer's Quarters<option value="slipstreambbs12353frm21">The Black Hole</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#EFD68C>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353>Slipstream Underground</a><font color=#EFD68C> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm12>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#EFD68C> - </font><a href="http://www.slipstreamunderground.com">Slipstream Underground</a><font color=#EFD68C> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
