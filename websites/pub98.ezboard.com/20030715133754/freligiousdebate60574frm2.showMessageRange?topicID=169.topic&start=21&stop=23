As far as the questions themselves...sorry you didn't care for them, my teacher on the other hand, thought they were great - and this was my 2nd set...he completely scrapped my first set! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My paper is not due until the 22nd (I think<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), but I'm hoping to get it done early, and when I get all the answers in I would be more than happy to post stuff here for discussion's sake (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>as long as it's okay with <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">everyone</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> who submitted answers!)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

I can totally see how they pertained and why they would form a great basis for critical examination and evaluative contrast.  The problem was in the details of the questions.  There was a great deal that went unsaid, such as the GMA euthinasia being 'my' decision.  I don't really see it as mine to make, consequently, there was no way to have put my self in the position the question harkens to and arrive at an answer.  The only way to be able to honestly answer those with any sort of absolutism would be to hold a prejudice.  All gays are bad, therefore tell the social worker how evil they are and prevent them from adopting.  All polygamous/polyandrous relations are bad, therefore bar them by law.  Any teen pregnancy must be aborted.  Life just doesn't fit into cookie-cutter little packages, so absent the details I didn't think I satisfactorily responded.<br>
<br>
For example, we are planning for our childrens survivorship in our will to have a lesbian appointed as our kids guardian.  It has absolutely NOTHING to do with her orientation.  It has everything to do with who she is.  She is a teen educator, she had a masters degree in gifted education, she is in a long-term and commited relationship that is healthy, stable and loving.  She loves my kids and they love her.  If I had to find any woman on the planet to be as good a mom as my wife is, she is the closest I could come.  No one could replace my wife, but she could do better than anyone I know.  I know my siblings couldn't provide it, I know my wife's siblings possibly could, but their situations prevent them from being able to.  (They are burdened enough with their own lives.)  My kids are more important to me than some dodgey prejudice or blood relationship. <br>
<br>
That information I think bears more insight as to why a man kissing another man good-bye is really meaningless to me.  Each area you hit on I have lived through.  I have a gay brother, my mom wanted euthanasia in her final battle with cancer, I have cohabitated, my sister was preganant at 14.  I have answers for all those issues, but not when they are faceless and lack back-ground facts.  Maybe I am going into too much detail about your questions.  I guess I will cut it here, but I hope you understand what I mean.  Not that the questions are bad, just that my answers were bound by the lack of deatil and that's why they were unsatisfactory to me. <p>DBC67<br>

I've found that everyone is doing that for the most part, explaining themselves and their reactions to each situation even without all of the details.  <br>
<br>
The point was for everyone to put themselves in the situation, and find out how they would react to it....is it a cut &amp; dry response no matter what? Does it depend on the situation?  Maybe it doesn't even matter what someone else would do, whatever works for me may not work for them? (And yes, I've gotten a varied response from one end of the spectrum to the other!)<br>
<br>
This is the kind of stuff I'm looking for through all of these answers that everyone is sending me.  I have had 10 out of 15 surveys returned to me, and I haven't been disappointed yet by anyone's replies!  <br>
