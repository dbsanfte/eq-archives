-----<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought you'd say that,&quot; Beka said as Trance came up behind Dylan to press a hypospray up against his neck. She watched as Beka caught him and then helped drag him to the bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You go on Trance, i'll get him ready for bed.&quot; Beka smiled as she said it and Trance nodded. She had some thinking to do anyway.<br>
<br>
As she walked back to her quarters her mind was spinning with possibilities. The destruction of the Andromeda had been so remote a possibility that she had never given it much thought, and as a result she was desperately trying to find a way to make everything right again.<br>
<br>
For if the Andromeda and her crew weren't at the big fight that was coming, the universe would burn. Life itself would be extuingished beneath the heel of the old ones, and everything she had worked, and suffered for, would be for naught.<br>
<br>
That last thought made up her mind, and she began searching the probability strings for a high gaurd heavy cruiser. One that had been lost, and would someday be found, and after much searching she found one. It was located in the Tellas system. <br>
<br>
Grabbing a small box she had kept with her for months now, she stood up. It took but a moment for Trance to teleport the distance between the two locations and appear on the bridge of the ship.<br>
<br>
&quot;Intru......lert....i..rud...er Alert,&quot; the damaged speakers intoned as she surveyed the bridge. It was fairly damaged but it looked serviceable.<br>
<br>
A hologram appeared before her, of a tall woman with light blond hair and a piercing gaze. <br>
&quot;Who are you, what are you doing on my bridge?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm Trance, I'm with the renewed High Guard.&quot; Trance said, pointing at her force lance. &quot;I'm here to help you. What's your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's been so long. I am the Fire that Burns Eternal.&quot; The AI said, somewhat mournfully, but Trance could taste the hunger in her eyes. The AI didn't want to be alone anymore.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can help. I need to know what happened to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was attacked, by Nietzscheans, my crew was killed, but I managed to evade them and hide here. but I had no way of repairing the damage as my machine shops had been destroyed in the fighting, and so I sat, without communication, without contact for three hundred years.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Trance listened to the AI recount the tale, she had a brief moment of indecision about what she was about to do, but shoved it aside. There were larger concerns.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, let me plug my diagnostic unit in, and we'll see if your engines are up and running, and I'll fly you to the Perseids, they are helping us rebuild the Commonwealth.&quot;<br>
<br>
The AI nodded eagerly as Trance crossed over to the main console and plugged in the device she had brought. With a quick prayer to a God she no longer believed in, she pressed the button.<br>
<br>
The effect was dramatic, the hologram screamed, and panels began stuttering, the lights flickered on and off. All over the ship, power started dying as the AI matrix was infested.<br>
<br>
&quot;What have you done?&quot; The hologram screamed, in pain and betrayal.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm erasing your entire AI matrix.&quot; Trance replied as she sat down in the command chair. She looked around somewhat sadly, when the holo-avatar appeared before her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why? I trusted you,&quot; it said, and Trance's heart jumped. It sounded so sad, so dissapointed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because no one will care who you are. If I do nothing, then when the universe burns, no soul will care that you stood with them at the end of days. The universe will fall, and all life will die, and there will be no one left.&quot; She stood up and walked towards the main viewscreen.<br>
<br>
&quot;If the Andromeda and her crew are there, they can change things. They can make a difference that no one else can, and the universe can be saved. To do that, they need a ship, this ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yo. can.. do thi. .o .. i'm a per..n.&quot; The AI demanded as she began to fade out herself, and Trance looked at her darkly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can do this, and I will do whatever it takes. Don't worry little AI, when I die, there will be a reckoning the likes of which has probably never been seen in whatever afterlife there is, but in the end, as long as the universe survives, that's a price i'm willing to pay.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Trance teleported out. With only a short stop over on one of the Perseid salvage ships to create a reactor imbalance that would force them to stop for repairs in the Tellas system, Trance returned to her room.<br>
<br>
She stretched back on the bed and closed her eyes, and for a moment was haunted by millenia of deeds so ugly as to be physically painfull, all leading up to the fight with the old ones that was coming.<br>
<br>
Giving the Vedrans technology to build their empire, nurturing the Vedrans through ten thousand years of conquest, and then arranging for the Nietzscheans to destroy the Commonwealth, nudging Gaheris Rhade just far enough to garantuee Dylan getting stuck in the black hole. Thousands of little things that were all designed to give the universe a good shot at surviving when the Old Ones awoke.<br>
<br>
It was a long list of crimes, and almost every one of them would earn her a death sentence on a thousand worlds. But that was okay, as long as the old ones were beaten, the ends did justify the means. In the end, if the universe survived, maybe the truly countless deaths she had caused, arranged or had a hand in, would be worthwile. <br>
<br>
For every race in existance knew her hand in it's history. <br>
On most she was the bringer of change and death, killing seemingly random people to make sure certain events happened. On Earth, the humans ancestral home, she had been immortalized in stories as one of four 'horsemen' bringing the apocalypse. In her vain moments Trance could appreciate the image they had crafted of her, but those moments were few, and certainly not for tonight.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow she would be aloof friendly Trance for her crewmates. Tomorrow she would be the friend and the warrior, but for tonight, Trance just laid back and considered the cruel hand she'd been dealt, and the weight she was forced to bear.<br>
<br>
Tonight, Trance Gemini just cried.<br>
