Alabama judge relents on moving monument<br>
SUPPORTERS JEER HIS SUSPENSION OVER TEN COMMANDMENTS<br>
By Manuel Roig-Franzia<br>
Washington Post<br>
<br>
MONTGOMERY, Ala. - After defying a federal court order and drawing hundreds of cheering Christian activists to this capital city, Alabama's crusading chief justice conceded Friday and said that he would not try to block the removal of his two-ton Ten Commandments monument from the rotunda of the Supreme Court building.<br>
<br>
``He will not interfere,'' said Stephen Melchior, the lead attorney for Chief Justice Roy Moore.<br>
<br>
Moore's concession was not enough, however, to stop the Alabama Judiciary Inquiry Commission from suspending him with pay for violating the federal court order. The commission referred a complaint about Moore to the Alabama Court of the Judiciary, which can hold hearings and discipline or remove judges.<br>
<br>
The suspension drew angry responses from demonstrators, who have massed outside the state Supreme Court for three days of prayer vigils.<br>
<br>
``This is an earthquake that will be felt from the East Coast to the West Coast of the United States of America,'' said John Giles, president of the Alabama Christian Coalition.<br>
<br>
The legal fight over the monument, which has come to be known as ``Roy's Rock,'' is sure to continue, Melchior said, even as Moore's fellow justices finalize plans to shift the monument to a non-public area of the court building or remove it.<br>
<br>
The suspension of Moore and the slow realization that he is powerless to stop the removal of the monument did not deter demonstrators, many of whom clung to hope that a ``miracle'' would change the outcome of a case that has ignited passionate debate for months and solidified the chief justice's iconic status among Christian conservatives.<br>
<br>
``Maybe they can move the monument, but they can't take it out of our hearts,'' said Rich Kendall, 52, who stood steps from the courthouse doors with a 10-foot-tall wooden cross that read ``Jesus died for you.''<br>
<br>
It increasingly appears that the monument will be moved to a non-public area of the court building. Associate justices have even been investigating whether it is heavy enough to crash through the unreinforced floors in private offices and elevators. Despite those signals, activists outside the courthouse remained wary that the monument would eventually be taken out of the building. They are maintaining 24-hour watches and vowing to risk arrest to keep it inside.<br>
<br>
``The monument is not coming out with us here,'' said the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, which has spearheaded the demonstrations.<br>
<br>
Moore's attorneys announced that he would not interfere with the monument's removal after pointed questioning by U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson during a telephone conference Friday morning. Moore, who has said Thompson was placing himself ``above God'' by ordering the monument's removal, had defied the federal order to remove the monument by midnight Wednesday. During the hearing, attorneys said, Thompson specifically asked Moore if he would interfere with the removal of the monument, and the chief justice's attorneys said he would not.<br>
<br>
Moore yielded after all eight associate justices of the Alabama Supreme Court took the rare step of overruling him Thursday and ordered the building manager to remove the monument. Melchior said the wording of the associate justices' order was critical: Because they directed the order to remove the monument at the building manager, rather than Moore, the chief justice thought he could step aside without ``violating his oath to uphold the Alabama Constitution and the U.S. Constitution.''<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
<br>
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (Reuters) - Building maintenance workers on Wednesday moved a controversial Ten Commandments monument from public view in Alabama's state judicial building. <br>
<br>
<br>
Workers wheeled away the two-ton granite monument from in front of a waterfall in the building. The monument, installed by the state's chief justice, Roy Moore, has been at the center of a bitter dispute involving the constitutional separation of church and state. <br>
<br>
<br>
Rev. Robert Schenck, a spokesman for the protesters who have demonstrated against the removal, said a building staff person had told him the monument would be moved to an employees-only hallway, where it would not be covered. It was not clear how long this arrangement would last. <br>
<br>
<br>
Federal courts have ordered the monument removed. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
