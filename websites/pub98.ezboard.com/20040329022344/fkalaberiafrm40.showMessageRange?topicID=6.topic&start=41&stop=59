<br>
                   Adelina said not knowing what to think about cloud and the way he acted. he was like a small boy in some ways, when it came to women. he knew nothing, nothing of the feelings and the difference between male and female besides looks. he probably thought that women were hear to make babies only, and that was their physical bodies only purpose. he was niaeve and innocent, but than he had killed before. it was a strange mix.<br>
<br>
          she thought this while she watched the scene between the bar waitress and cloud. the girl came and kissed cloud on the cheek and he fell over once more. this time it really annoyed adelina, she hated the scene between them and it disgusted her. the whole idea about it made her want to throw up, or at least thats what she thought. she thought it was shallow and meaningless to flaunt yourself like such in front of a guy, the fact that it was cloud and he was pretty much innocent didnt make it any better.<br>
<br>
                      &quot; no its not a bad feeling, did it feel bad? didnt think so, and its not a disease. although i must admit it does drive men mad. its attraction between 2 people, obviously you were attracted to the bar maid when she kissed you or else that feeling wouldnt be so great.&quot;<br>
<br>
              she said, not smiling. she had that solemn look on her face, cold as stone not revealing any emotion. she saw cloud recieve a free drink and told him &quot; im pretty sure you dont need another drink you keep fallin all over yourself as it is.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ooocloudooo>oOo cloud oOo</A></span><br> Posts: 23<br> <font color=#8B4513>(1/29/04 12:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.haxed.co.uk/coppermine/albums/userpics/11202/oOoCloudoOo.jpg Width=167 Height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a new start</span><hr size=1> Cloud looked at adelina frowning<br>
<br>
&quot;Id love to stop but at the momment its the only numbness i can get from the stinging of my raw flesh thats welded my eyelid shut....Ok ill stop drinking after i get my blinker open again&quot;<br>
<br>
Cloud took his nail to his eyelid and slowly ran it across where the eyelids should part cutting the flesh that was welding the eyelids together<br>
<br>
&quot;There thats better now i can see lotsof things&quot;<br>
Not taking any totice of his eyelids that seemed to be dripping with blood he picked up the bottle of red wine and took one last gulp then he put the bottle gently down on the bar and turned to adelina<br>
<br>
&quot;Women dont just make babies anyway my dad told me that women are equal and should be treated so, he also said if you want company its best being your own company women are anoying and blab on about nothing?! ive heard you women are really good at singing!&quot;<br>

&quot;I hope nobody lives on the top floor of that building&quot;<br>
<br>
Cloud cut the palm of his right hand and quickly shot two streams of blood out that shot towards the top roof of the builduing and then he grabbed adelina by her waist withought a word of warning they flew up the building being pulled up by clouds vine of blood and just as they reached the top window cloud swung feet first through the window and skidded across the floor like he was skateboarding and went face first into a wall just before he let go of adelina,Cloud got up a bit dizzy and brushed himself down and walked around the room and then he stood still to sniff around<br>
<br>
&quot;The top floor of this building is completely deserted?&quot;<br>
<br>
The room was very large and bare and had 2 other rooms at the back that where also bare and had slide door cubaords and bare king sized beds in each room. The floor was a black and white  marble and dusty and at the left hand side of the room there was a large bathroom, the window that cloud had smashed through there was a wooden ledge and a piano on it from the left of the window was a small kitchen and on the right hand side of the room was the door, cloud had just noticed that the window he came through was a slide window and had a balcony outside of it <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh man! I just ruined my windows and im lucky i didnt hit my head on that balcony too&quot;<br>
<br>
Cloud heard footsteps outside the door and rand over to it and opened it there was a lond corridoor that also had marble flooring and by the looks of it was cleaned regulary there was a row of doors leading down each side of the corridoor and a lift right at the end to the right and stairs to the left cloud looked at the doors and they all seemed to have nombers on them Clouds said 888 just as cloud turned his head to look again something hit him in the face and dropped to the ground<br>
cloud looked down on the floor to see a key with a lable on it that said 888<br>
<br>
&quot;Heh must be the keys to my room thanks whoever u are why doncha come out at play?&quot;<br>
<br>
a man in a leather jacket and and shades on dropped from the ceiling infront of cloud smiling he was obviously a vampire as he was flashing his fangs he wore big black boots and had baggy trousers and he wore shades and had a cap on backwards he looked about clouds age but a little shorter than him he spoe to cloud loudly and in a strange tone<br>
<br>
&quot;YOoOoOOo Dude somebody finally dropped in to buy the top flat hasnt been used in over 12 years Oh yeah names Olly Oh sorry to put the ice down your spine Ok you Like owe me 5000 for the flat Im the genator here&quot;<br>
<br>
Cloud smiled and laughed <br>
&quot;I thought you where gonna try and attack me ore something there&quot;<br>
<br>
Cloud pulled out a bag full of money and gave it to him<br>
Olly's mouth dropped wide open<br>
&quot;Whoa DUDE!! are you like' royalty or somet caue nobody carries dough like that around with em&quot;<br>
<br>
Cloud grinned at him<br>
&quot;Yeh im prince of the darkness clan.......How about you do me a favour and clean this place up for me.....DUDE! ive payed you 6000 over budget so the least you can do is make it shine&quot;<br>
<br>
Olly smiled and walked in past Cloud to take a look a look around then stretched<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok Ill make it like bling bling shine kay&quot;<br>
he walked to the cuboard near the kitchen sink and pulled out some cleaning gear and a floor polisher<br>
then he turned round and spotted adelina<br>
&quot;Whoa baaabbeelicious! Im sorry i didnt see you there whats your name Darling&quot;<br>
<br>
Cloud walked over to Olly and stood infront of adelina folding his arms and giving him a cold stare<br>
&quot;None of your buisness and dont even think about touching her or ill kill you Got it....DUDE!<br>
<br>
Olly's face dropped and he went and plugged the floor polisher in &quot;Yikes no offence!........Ill just get on with the biz then&quot;<br>
Cloud went and sat down next to the piano and started to play a strange tune..... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.haxed.co.uk/coppermine/albums/userpics/11202/oOoCloudoOo.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
                &quot; nice landing there bat boy, no it isnt deserted im pretty sure its just this room that is dusty and smells old. and its not like hitting your head on that balcony really would have affected you anyway, by the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
            She watched him scurry over to the door, and stood there as another male vampyre almost pounced on him. Cloud got up and a man descended from the cieling. he looked young, obviously a vampyre, with a modern urban style.<br>
<br>
                    the guy spoke like a surfer valley boy, and adelina was completely blind of any timewise education. she wondered how old he was, he wasnt weak, but he acted as if he hadnt been a vampyre too long. they made their deals and cloud shoved a bag of money at Olly. <br>
<br>
                 Olly came into clean and thats when he noticed adelina. he praised her in a very surfish way, for lack of a better term, and cloud took over. he stalked over and stepped in front of adelina, who stood there like a stone calm and peaceful. she watched the scene as Ollys foolish smile turned into utter shock and he went about his business as cloud sat down to play the piano.<br>
<br>
                   Adelina still stood there observing the two men,and decided that she would introduce herself and have a little fun with the new little janator that cloud had hired.<br>
she walked over to him as she noticed him occasionally stealing glances, and bent down as he was gathering cleaning supplies.<br>
<br>
              &quot; hey im adelina&quot; she said in a sultry voice &quot; from what i heard your name is olly. so olly you got a woman?&quot;<br>
she laughed in spite of herself at the look on his face and stood up. she looked over to cloud and gave him a very wide mischevous smile. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ooocloudooo>oOo cloud oOo</A></span><br> Posts: 26<br> <font color=#8B4513>(2/3/04 10:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.haxed.co.uk/coppermine/albums/userpics/11202/oOoCloudoOo.jpg Width=167 Height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a new start</span><hr size=1> Cloud listened to the conversation then turned his head wilst still playing his tune and gave olly a half smile <br>

Cloud laughed with a smile on his face and carried on playing the piano and started singing <br>
<br>
&quot;In blood and death 'neath a<br>
  screaming sky<br>
I lay down on the ground.<br>
And the arms and legs of other men<br>
were scattered all around.<br>
Some cursed some prayed,<br>

The prayed then bled some more.<br>

there was no pair of brown eyes <br>

Cloud quietly got up and walked out into the corrdoor outof adelina and olly's sight and walked towards the stairs there where stairs leading up and stairs leadind down,obviously the stairs leading up went to the roof of the building exactly where cloud was wanting to go he quietly walked up the stairs and through the door,the cold night breeze hit his face and the moon as large as ever shaun bright he walked over to the edge of the roof and sat down dangling his legs over the edge and looked down, it was hard to see anything down below every thing was blurred from being so high up he smiled and folded his arms still sitting on the edge dangling his feet and started to hum to himself staring at the moon. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.haxed.co.uk/coppermine/albums/userpics/11202/oOoCloudoOo.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
                            she followed silently slipping through the doors. he must not have known she was following for he didnt  turn or say anything to her. she followed him up the stairs, stealthy as a tiger, and slipped through the metal door just as it was about to close. she stood against it and watched him go sit and hang his feet over the edge. the cold chilled her skin, cutting to the bone. the wind skipped through her hair, whisteling in her ear, and tickling her face. she watched him sit and hum to himself, and silently basically floated over and took a seat right next to him, watching the world above and below. she gazed at the moon, powerful and protective, like a mother. and the only thing she had left to count on ever.<br>

&quot;Why did you follow me?.......*sigh* forget i asked&quot;<br>
<br>
Cloud layed back on the roof<br>
<br>
&quot;So much has changed since i last saw the moon, however humanities desire to destroy has not and they call us beasts?<br>
they wont stop hunting me till im dead, you know your free to leave me anytime you want&quot;<br>
<br>
Cloud went in his trouser pocket and pulled out a necklace it had Sapphire diamonds on its that shone blue in the moonlight,the diamonds were shaped like hearts, he sat up next to adelina and gently put the necklace around her neck and fastened it<br>
<br>
&quot;Got that of my dad....it was a present to my mother from him before i was born i have no pictures of her only this, i have no need for it you can keep it for putting up with me&quot;<br>
<br>
Cloud then leaned over the edge and took a dive over the edge of the building putting his arms out<br>
he fell straight towards the balcony of his apartment and landed on his feet, Olly who was poloshing the floor jumped of the polisher and landed flat out on the floor outof fright then he got back up like nothing happened giving cloud short nervous glances and strolled over to the polisher that was dancing about the floor grasping its handles and then started wisling then after a moment he turned it off and put it back in the cuboard where it came from then he walked over to cloud with his hands in his pockets<br>
<br>
&quot;Well its all bling bling dude! oh and by the way i live next door if you needs me,but itl cost yah&quot;<br>
<br>
Coud laghed at him,afterall he was rather a funny character<br>
<br>
&quot;hahaha i think we will become good freind Olly, feel free to come around anytime you like&quot;<br>
<br>
Olly grabbed clouds hand and shook it in a strange way<br>
and then left through the door <br>

                       she decided not to follow the same way, she was now confused, angry and hurt. but no one needed to know about the third one. she ran down the stairs fast as she could go, wich considering what she was was pretty damn fast.  she walked to the door just as olly was leaving, she pushed him aside and stalked in. <br>

<br>
&quot;And what do you expect me to think when you tell me you dont care and act so calous towards me! i want you to stay but you say you dont care, so naturally i thought you didnt want me bothering you?&quot;<br>

he stepped up to her face to face staring deep into her eyes<br>

he ran his fingers down one side her face with his fingers then gently rested the palm of his hand on her cheek<br>
