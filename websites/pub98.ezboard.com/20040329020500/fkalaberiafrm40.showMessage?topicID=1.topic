She knew they were back there, even if she didn't hear them. The vamps were like that. They moved fast and quiet. But she wasn't going give up her freedom without a fight. Not this time.<br>
<br>
She fought for breath as her lungs began to burn, but still she pushed on. If she could only...yes there ahead, she caught a glimpse of her destination. As she cut across the deserted street she thought she could hear them closing in.<br>
<br>
As her feet hit the grass, Taylee breathed in the heavy mist that now surrounded her. She knew she'd made it. That tonight she'd won. They wouldn't follow her here. Still she didn't slow down until she reached the tree line of the park.<br>
<br>
Taylee slowed, gasping, but didn't stop. She could see some sort of building tucked back from the path she was on and veered towards it. Cautiously she circled what looked like a maintaince shed until she came to the front. A pair of double doors stood firmly locked by a chain and padlock. She stood, breathing heavily, looking at the chain for a moment before grabbing it and shaking it. &quot;Well,&quot; she said to herself &quot;at least I don't have to worry about anybody hiding inside.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leaning against the doors Taylee's knees finally buckled and she slid to the ground, exhausted. She wasn't sure how long she sat there in a daze until several drops of water hitting her hand roused her. &quot;Damn it,&quot; she swore, swiping at the tears that fell down her cheeks. 'Why am I crying?' she thought 'I won. He didn't catch me this time.' But it was a hollow victory as she sat there, alone in the dark.<br>

Taylee's eyes narrowed as the other woman extended her hand offering to take her somewhere safe. But the rest of the stranger's words sounded to much like a threat for her to accept straight out. Without taking the offered hand, Taylee, using the building at her back pushed herself to her feet. &quot;Now why would you do that?.....out of the kindness of your heart?...&quot; <br>
<br>
She kicked at the dead grass with one of her booted feet, appearing to not have a worry in the world. A game they both knew to be false, as the howl grew closer. Continuing she looked at the other woman, &quot;I don't think so...there is no kindness in this world.

As she gestured for Taylee to come with her, Taylee caught the scent of smoke and decided maybe the other girl was right. There was someone else out there, hiding in the dark.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine &quot; Taylee said, trying to look around but not be obvious to whoever was waiting in the shadows, &quot;I'll come with you.&quot; She still didn't totally trust this other girl but the alternative somehow seemed worse at the moment.<br>

<br>
'A vamp,' she wondered, 'no they wouldn't come into the park. Then who....why?' She was sure he'd been talking to her...a feeling in the pit of her stomach. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; she called out but the only answer she got was the sound of his footsteps fading farther away. Raising her face to the dead sky she screamed &quot;Why do you want to kill me?&quot;<br>
<br>
After a minute of silence Taylee turned back to the girl, &quot;I guess, I'm with you. Seems there's no other choice. But I have one question....do you know him?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
(ooc: A ghoul is a human (alive) that has been blood-bonded to a Vampire by drinking his blood. They become almost like a slave to their master, until the bond is broken. Even becoming addicted to the pleasure of being bitten. DLM, I didn't know if you knew this and were playing George like he doesnt know or not.

Soon they both burst out into the city which remained dark and gloomy, with the occasionally peircing laughter, of vampires.
