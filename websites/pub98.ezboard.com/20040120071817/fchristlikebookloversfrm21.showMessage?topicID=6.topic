<br>
By Spiritualizing Our Physical Consciousness we establish a means of conscious communion between ourself and our God or Goddess. Literally we are &quot;seeking&quot; His &quot;Kingdom&quot;, and His &quot;Righteousness&quot;, and Remember this: that upon entering into the Silence, you are entering into the &quot;presence&quot; of your God.<br>
<br>
The &quot;secret&quot; is to believe it will work, and it will work. To substantiate this statement, let us look to a few Biblical passages in which Jesus talks about &quot;Believing&quot;. Then pick up a Concordance and do your own work!<br>
<br>
Reading John 1:7, we see that John came as a witness to bear witness of the Light, that ALL men through him might &quot;believe&quot;. And reading John 6:64, &quot;But there are some of you that `believe' not&quot;. And John 3:12, &quot;If you have been told earthly things which are true, and ye &quot;believed&quot; not, how shall ye `believe' if Itell you of Heavenly things?&quot; Then reading John 11:40 &quot;Said Inot unto thee, that, if thou wouldest &quot;believe&quot;, thou shouldest see the glory (Light) of God?&quot; And in John 12:36, we read &quot;Ye have Light `believe' in the Light, that ye may be called the Children of Light. &quot;Now reading Luke 8:12, &quot;Those by the wayside are they that hear, then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their Hearts, lest they should `believe' and be saved.&quot; And Mark 11:24, &quot;Therefore Isay unto you, What things soever ye desire (Spiritual Things), &quot;when ye pray, `believe' that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Know that if you are Sincere and Honorable in your Intent, that you can go as High as your motive will take you. And what does motive mean? In this instance, motive means. &quot;What do you want this Spiritual Knowledge for? &quot;It is out of curiosity, or for selfish purposes? If so, you will not get far. But if it is from a Heartfelt DESIRE to acquaint ALL humanity with your findings, then there is no limit placed upon the Spiritual Knowledge for you to obtain. The only hindrance will be your capacity to put forth the necessary Desire and Effort.<br>
<br>
At your desired time, sit down in a comfortable chair, close your eyes gently and relax physically from the top of your head to the tip of your toes. Clear your mind of its cluttered rambling thoughts. Send a Loving thought to your God or Goddess, and the Blessed Ones of Light who are One with your God, and ask for Spiritual Unfoldment. Then stop thinking by letting your mind go blank like a movie screen just before the motion picture starts. Sit there in the Silence and wait for your God or Goddess to sent you thoughts, pictures, words, or a combination.<br>
<br>
Yes, you must become absent minded; absent of thought. Quiet your thought process and bring your physical mind under control; empty your mind of all its ramblings. You must control your mind to the point where it cannot and must not think of anything. Stop your brain from thinking about what it hears, feels, smells, tastes and sees. And remember; that if you do think about what you hear or see, you will lose contact!<br>
<br>
Do not forget that it is the efforts of your physical mind that you don't want. You want a lack of effort on the part of your physical mind; the making of it inactive. At first you may find this hard to do; so, if you must think of something, then think of the Peace that you feel as you sit there in the Silence. As you receive thought or pictures, Do not think about what you are receiving or it will stop. Just let things unfold naturally: don't think!<br>
<br>
Become very &quot;still' as the Psalmist David says in the Book of Psalms 46:10 &quot;Be Still, and know that lam God.&quot; &quot;Be Still and Know&quot;, is clearly a direct command to the Physical mind to rest from its earthly activities and receive the Spiritual Knowledge that your God waits to reveal. Remember: your mind is not capable of receiving Spiritual Instruction when it is preoccupied with earth earthly ideas. Both cannot occupy the same space at the same time.<br>
<br>
As Jesus says in Matthew 6:6 &quot;But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet (mind), and when thou hast shut the door (become quiet), pray to the Father which is in Secret.&quot; Remember, &quot;God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and in Truth&quot; - John 4:24<br>
<br>
While you may have a tendency to fall asleep - it is sleep you want to avoid. Become sincerely interested in what your God or Goddess has to &quot;reveal&quot; to you; simply absorb the thoughts and pictures which will come to you. Watch and approach the &quot;secret place&quot; of the Most High.<br>
<br>
Do not expect this to come in a short time: for you have lived in an earthly body devoted to earthly things and activities, and they cannot be discarded all at once. Reading Isaiah 1:18, God says - &quot;Come now, and let Us reason together&quot;.<br>
<br>
But know that the moment you start to attempt to come closer to the Light of your God or Goddess, He or She knows of your EFFORTS and DESIRES and will reward you accordingly. The more ardent your EFFORTS, the quicker you will draw help to you from the assisting Blessed Ones of Light.<br>
<br>
Yes, as the outer mind (physical mind) turns its attention inwards, it opens by degrees the floodgates to the Father who is gladly waiting to pour into your physical consciousness, for expression, a constant flow of Eternal Truths to feed your soul.<br>
<br>
Notice first that Truth comes to the physical, then as the physical expresses (teaches) it, there comes food for the soul. Of course &quot;food&quot; means Light: for nothing comes from your God but Light. And it is the expressing of these Spiritual Truths of your God by the physical part of you that causes your soul to store up that Light which you take with you when you lay down the body. This stored Light is your passport (garment) into the Realm to which you are entitled to go.<br>
<br>
Always remember that the Eternal Part of you, your God or Goddess, is Pure and Everlasting and withholds nothing from your physical consciousness or soul consciousness. Remember it is the activity of our physical mind and body, when devoted to earthly things only, or too much so, that cuts off the inflow of our God's Light. Your God's Spirit Light cannot register in a human controlled mind.<br>
<br>
As Jesus says in Matthew 6:24, &quot;No man can serve two Masters for either he will hate one, and Love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye CANNOTserve God and Mammon&quot;. This makes it perfectly clear - if we want to succeed we must devote ourself either to God or to earthly things, whichever we want. Complete devotion is the &quot;~secret&quot; of True and Quick success no matter which we choose.<br>
<br>
So, what is this Spiritual illumination that we hear so much talk about? It is the Light of Eternity which is brought to the Chosen Ones; the Ones who &quot;choose&quot; to follow in the way Jesus has laid down. The greater&quot; your Desire for this Light, the greater your Spiritual illumination becomes.<br>
<br>
Spiritual illumination can only be attained by and through the Light which comes closer to each one who seeks associationship with their Father or Mother; who is always with you. `Seek, and ye shall find&quot; - this is the promise. Yes, Spiritual illumination can be attained through the Light, and you can become ONE with your Father or Mother. Your God will, and does, &quot;reveal&quot; that which your &quot;Being&quot; is ready to receive and open to receive. Remember: Jesus' True Church is the &quot;Church of Revelation&quot;; built on Divine Revelations from Heaven.<br>
