<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Why do I continue to do this?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
As he watched Sara fall asleep, Stephen Crowley reflected on the path that had taken him to this point, and the evening’s events. The snide look on Alia’s face at the party had almost been too much to take sitting down. If Crowley recalled correctly, it was she who had presented those Tzimice before then Princess Marie, and took them under the accounting of Clan Tremere some months ago. That had lead to a Sabbat invasion and a major breach of the Masquerade – which Crowley, of course, had covered up, without so much as a “thank you” from the warlocks. If the witch wanted to find amusement in his troubles, he would remember it in his future dealings. That was the problem with the Tremere – they always assumed they’d never need help from others. <br>
<br>
And he continued serving the city. For all the good it did him. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Introspection. Far too much introspection and soul seeking. I’ve been given guide… mentors… advice… and yet… </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“And yet you continue to fail.” A voice deep inside his head cooed. “And yet you continue to serve your faith, your Sect and your city. All for what?” <br>
<br>
Crowley paused several moments after receiving this message. He examined himself closely… and realized it was only his own self-doubt talking. He almost chuckled. Far too many voices inside his head for too many months. Nice to see his own madness reasserting itself.<br>
<br>
He was not bound. At least, he was not as far as he could tell. He could come and go as he wished; the only barriers were the ones he set up for himself. He had the responsibilities he had taken up, and those must be seen to, but besides that what was there keeping him back? <br>
<br>
Keiran had been right. His faith would mean nothing in facing the challenges ahead if he did not believe in himself. To hell with the Gangrel. To hell with the Tremere. To hell with Santa Carla. Perhaps he would take Vicious up on his offer. Some time away from the city would do him good. <br>
<br>
Crowley stood up and walked over to Sara’s bedside. Gently, he caressed her hair and face while she slept. Reading her aura, Crowley could tell she had calmed down considerably, but some distress lingered. No doubt, he reasoned, the prolonged absence of her Regnant. The lack of vitae alone could be difficult for a ghoul, not to mention to emotional stress caused by lengthy separation. The blood bond was nothing to be trifled with. He briefly considered feeding her himself, perhaps easing her duress. He shook the thought from his head. No, he thought, Prince Orlock would never approve, not at any even perceived poaching of his own clanmate’s ghoul. Whatever Crowley may have thought of his choices for officers, that insufferable Tremere Isaac Stone as Harpy and that Gangrel Anarch Ivan as Keeper, Crowley would not disrespect the Nosferatu’s Praxis. For Sara’s sake, he hoped Willard would, indeed, return so. If not, he hoped Orlock would take appropriate steps. Crowley had seen many first-hand examples of what happened to ghouls abandoned by their Regnants. He found it…. distasteful to think such a think would happen to Sara Anjeal.<br>
<br>
Crowley leaned down a lightly kissed Sara on the forehead. “Sleep well, Sara. I hope we both find the peace each of us craves.” He then made his exit. After what had happened, he needed to feed before sunrise.<br>

behind him. Just inside the door some poor fellow is sitting on the floor. He<br>
tries to say something to the doctor, but all he can make out over the loud<br>
music is something about "Straight edge", "Boomer" and "upstairs". Ben looks<br>
around the room at the faces on the all the writing bodies on the dance floor,<br>
recognizing more than a few of them. He'd met many of them in his professional<br>
capacity. From the obvious free-flow of drugs in the place, his colleagues<br>
would be dealing with a few more of them tonight.<br>
<br>
<p>Ben spots Boomer and Mitch ahead of him and with his unnaturaly keen<br>
hearing just makes out Boomer's instruction to make him a drink, something<br>
that will "fuck him up". Taking longer steps to catch up as he reaches inside<br>
his coat, he taps Mitch on the shoulder taps Mitch on the shoulder extracting<br>
a small bottle. "Here, these should produce... in'erestin' results." he says<br>
with a wink to Mitch as he shakes some pills out into the ghoul's hand.<br>
<br>
<p>Slipping the pill bottle back into his coat, The Doctor walkes out onto the<br>
dance floor. Turning on his considerable personal charm, sprinkled with the<br>
talent shared with the rest of his Family, he singles out a pretty young thing<br>
and starts dancing with her. Much to the consternation of other, younger<br>
males in the area, her attention is all on him. Soon he maneuvers her to one<br>
side of the room and before long he has her pressed against the wall, still<br>
writhing to the music. Looking for all the world like a cowboy mac-daddy<br>
making out with a much younger woman, he quickly slips lower, nibbling<br>
his way from her lips to her chin, down to her throat... she lets out a short,<br>
shrill scream as his fangs pierce her carotid artery, unnoticed by anyone<br>
over the loud music. Her head lulls back, a dreamy expression on her face as<br>
he begins to suck slowly, ever so slowly, enjoying her rich bouquet. No need to<br>
rush here. He knows what they look like; he knows he has plenty of time to<br>
savor this warm, tasty snack. It's been a couple of weeks since he had enjoyed<br>
a nice, fresh meal. It just wasn't the same, cold, stored, filled with<br>
anti-coagulants. A nice, warm, wiggly young woman was so much more tastey than<br>
an IV bag...<br>
<br>
<p>Having sated his appetite for something fresh, he slowly licks her neck,<br>
enjoying the flavor of the last few drops on his tongue as the wound closes.<br>
She sags against him, the ecstasy of the Kiss slowly wearing off. Putting an<br>
arm around her, Ben half guides, half carries her to a couch in the quiet<br>
room, stopping along the way to grab a bottle of water. He sets her down on<br>
the couch, crouching in front of her. Opening the bottle and handing it to her<br>
he says "He'h, drink this." Reaching into his coat again he produces several<br>
different bottles. "Looks like you pahtied a little too ha'd, dahlin'." He<br>
opens the various bottles and extracts a pill from each, "Here, take these."<br>
he says, taking her hand and placing the pills in her palm.<br>
<br>
<p>"What are they?" she asks drowsily.<br>
<br>
<p>"Oh, jus' sumthin' ta make you feel better..." he sais with a wink and a<br>
smile.  He stands up, slipping the bottles of B and E vitimins and iron<br>
supplements back into his coat as he turns and walks away.<br>
<br>
<hr><br>
<>(later)</h3><br>
<br>
<p>The Doctor is sitting on a couch upstairs with the other Cainites, terribly<br>
amused by the effect the pills he gave Mitch are having on Boomer. Sara and<br>
Crowley walk in and sit down next to boomer. Boomer, snapping out of a<br>
drug-induced trance, jumps up with a startled cry and falls off the couch. Ben<br>
doubles over, silently laughing hystericly, slapping his thigh with the effort<br>
of trying not to laugh out loud. Eventually the movie starts and Ben is sucked<br>
into the story.<br>
<br>
<p>Viscious arrives and moves to talk to Crowley. Seeing his primogen, Ben<br>
rolls his eyes without comment and goes back to watching the movie.<br>
<blockquote><br>
Following his talk with Crowley, Vicious gave him a friendly pat on the back,<br>
stood up, pulled out his baton lifted it for all to see and jumped on the<br>
table.<br>
<br>
<p>"OKAY, ANYONE ELSE WHO THINKS IT'D BE FUN AND ENTERTAINING TO FUCK WITH<br>
CROWLEY WILL QUICKLY LEARN WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE SIX FEET OF TITANIUM<br>
ALLOY FORCIBLY INSERTED INTO THEIR INTESTINAL TRACT!"<br>
</blockquote><br>
Ben leans over and whispers to The Herald "Borrow this for a sec?" Before The<br>
Herald can react, The Doctor snatches the Koosh launcher from his lap, fires a<br>
Koosh at the back of Viscious' head and tosses the launcher back to The<br>
Herald. By the time Viscious turns around, Ben's boots are back up on the<br>
coffee table, his arms crossed in front of him as he gazes at the TV with a<br>
bored expression under the brim of his hat. "Shaddup and siddown, ya Poser.<br>
