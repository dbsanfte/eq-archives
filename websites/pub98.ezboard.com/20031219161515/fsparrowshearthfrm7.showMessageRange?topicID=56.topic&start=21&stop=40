Where does the Bible say that those who belong to Christ will be forced to suffer for their sins after death?  Honestly, that sounds sacreligious to me - it totally defeats what Christ did on the cross.  Suddenly, Christ's suffering for us and His sacrifice was not enough.  I will end up having to pay for my sins in some form because Christ's blood wasn't enough.  Sorry, I refuse to accept this and believe it to be totally against the Bible.  Jesus sacrifice for us was perfect and complete.  He suffered for us so that we would not.  Why would He force us to suffer when He suffered in our place?  That makes absolutely no sense.  I can't even put into words what you're making God sound like. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This sounds a lot like mormonism to me.<br>

<br>
Thanks for addressing this question from the Bible, while<br>
refraining from leaning on the deutero-canonical books.<br>
(Or whatever they're called.)<br>
<br>
I'm familiar with the verses you cited. <br>
My understanding of them is far different from the one<br>
you cited, however.<br>
<br>
If they reflect a concept that we simply tack the name<br>
&quot;purgatory&quot; to, then I have no problem accepting the concept<br>
of purgatory.   However, I do not believe they in any way<br>
reflect that.  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure if it would be good to get into the whole<br>
&quot;Judgement Day&quot; subject at this place and time.<br>
However, the I Corinthians 15 verses, to me, seem to refer<br>
to specific events as yet in the future.   The same with<br>
the &quot;trial by fire&quot;,which, if I understand correctly, is the<br>
closest section of Scripture to what you are describing.<br>
<br>
If it seems profitable to you, I'm not adverse to discussing<br>
them verse-by-verse and comparing out understanding<br>
with the texts-or at least the modern versions and the <br>
Stephens Text, which I can grab fairly easy at times.<br>
<br>
If it does not seem profitable to you, we can just forget<br>
about it and love each other as brothers anyway.<br>
(Or scorn each other, as the manner of some is.)<br>
<br>
Let me know what you think will profit the good group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeffthefinn>jeffthefinn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://webpages.charter.net/nilus/finnbutton.GIF" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;><b>Your Friendly<br>Orthodox Resource</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 192<br> <font color=#B87333>(11/9/03 2:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/nilus/jfinn.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Praying for the dead</span><hr size=1> By saying the Catholics added books, that demanded a response because that is just not true.

What history did you study? &quot;The Great Controversy Ended&quot; by Ellen White? What is really, really sad is that you are propogating this unhistorical anti-Catholic lie. <br>
<br>
If this is your retort to the fact that the Old Testament canon of the Christians included the deuterocanonical books I feel sorry and embarrased for the whole of protestantism.  <br>
<br>
Here is what some Protestant/Catholic/Jewish scholars think about the closing of the canon:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>J.P. Lewis:“That the Old Testament canon was not completed until the Christian era is recognized by all critical scholars today, and many suggest that the rivalry offered by Christian books was a spur for the closing of the Jewish canon.”<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Menachem Cohen: “the motives behind the struggle were, apparently, ideological and polemical, aimed at deviant groups (Christians, Samaritans) who had adopted these text-types;”<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sundberg:“Writing about 90 C.E., Josephus gives us the first glimpse of a nearly finished Jewish canon.”<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> The Pontifical Biblical Commission: “When Judaism came to close its own canon, the Christian Church was<br>
sufficiently independent from Judaism not to be immediately affected. It was only at a later period that a closed Hebrew canon began to exert influence on how Christians viewed it.”<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It is without any scholarly doubt that the early Christian community used the Septuagint (LXX) which included the deuterocanonical books. Even the original 1611 KJV included them in an appendix.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You're really trying my patience. All I said was that I was refraining from making a comment to it. I said nothing to argue it. So I see your posting the same thing again as an attempt to provoke me into commenting. My opinion would be rather strong and I really don't want to get into the issue. So let's just drop it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Jeff...ie. read between the lines: Catholics and Orthodox are not Christians.<br>
<br>
If being familiar with history makes Catholics and Orthodox not Christian, well then I am not Christian by your definition of the word.<br>
<br>
But isn't that what the convert John Henry Cardinal Newman wrote: &quot;To know history is to cease being Protestant.&quot;<br>

I've got no problems discussing Purgatory, and as it really isn't a strong opinion of mine (although I do believe that we will be &quot;judged&quot; by God upon our deaths) I can approach the topic with a certain amount of detachment.<br>
<br>
I'm going to start a new thread since this one seems to be going in a couple of different directions.  I'll try to put into that thread all the scriptural references as well as commentaries from sources such as the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the Catholic Encyclopedia.<br>

<br>
Yes, for us the past is the past, but not for God.<br>
<br>
God <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>created</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> time.  He is not bound by time.  Although it is hard to say whether God controls time, exists outside of time or is simply not bound by time is hard to say.  It may even be a combination of all three, but the point is that we all acknowledge God as the creator of the universe.  Time is a component of the universe (some call it the fourth dimension) and we experience time in a linear fashion.  God, being the creator of that dimension should &quot;logically&quot; exert some control over it as He has control over the rest of His creation.<br>
<br>
To say that God is bound by time would be to limit His power. <br>
<br>
Therefore, to many it is acceptable to pray for something that has already happened where we do not really know what the outcome is.  We cannot pray for someone we know has broken a leg (for example) not to have broken a leg.  It is something that is already a part of our consciousness and will not be changed.  However, when it is something where we don't have a knowledge of the outcome, it is permissable for us to pray as God still has command over what has transpired.  That is why you will hear many pray for someone who died that they accpeted Christ at a point before their death.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this isn't the easiest topic to discuss, as it kind of goes beyond our concept of linear time.  <br>
<br>
There isn't anything is scripture that specifically prohibits praying for something in the past either.  So I see it as one of those gray areas where it doesn't make a huge difference in the grand scheme of things. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man.<br>

You make it sound like tradition is nothing.  If it were not for Tradition you would not have a Bible to begin with.  The Church existed for 400 years without an agreed upon canon of the New Testament.  The foundational doctrinal statement the Nicene Creed was published before the New Testament Canon was firmed up. <br>
If there is nothing against praying for the dead, and Maccabees shows that was practiced then to throw out the book because it does not agree with what one think's should be is to put oneself over the &quot;Word of God&quot;.  For 1500+ years all of Christendom viewed Maccabees as Scripture, most still do, it is only the Protestants that edited the Old Testament.<br>

<br>
This is circular reasoning. How can you decide what is against the Bible without first establishing what the Bible is. By this logic we sould get rid of the entire New Testament, especially any Trinitarian references.<br>
<br>
After all, it was, as Jeff noted, &quot;tradition&quot; which established the Bible, and not vice-versa. For this reason I see zero-zilch-zip reasons to be a Protestant. If Catholicism is true, then there are any number of reasons to be a Protestant, but it doesn't begin to compare with actually being a Catholic. If Catholicism is wrong, there are no reasons to be a Protestant. Protestantism's only authority rests on the authority of the one, holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br>

<br>
I agree that God is neither limited by time nor space. <br>
(I can cite the verses, but since we agree, it seems<br>
 unnecessary.)<br>
<br>
It's a separate question as to whether or not God wants<br>
US to operate in a linear timeframe.<br>
The evidence seems to support that He DOES want us to<br>
operate in a linear fashion.<br>
<br>
I say that because I accept the omniscience of God and <br>
believe He knows how it all will turn out, but believe He does<br>
not tell us all of it, thereby allowing us to retain our freewill.<br>
<br>
There are Christians out there who DON'T accept this, and<br>
they're the ones who doubt God's omniscience.<br>
<br>
However, God's choosing to deal with us in a linear fashion<br>
explains how God gives us a warning, and, when we heed it,<br>
we &quot;change what would happen&quot;.  The fastest example of<br>
this is the Book of Jonah.  Jonah warned of the judgement of<br>
God, the people repented, and the judgement was stayed.<br>
This was NOT a surprise to God, but He didn't tell Jonah<br>
&quot;the people will definitely repent, so this is just a warning.&quot;<br>
He allowed Jonah and the people to make their own <br>
decisions.<br>
<br>
I'm confident God COULD do whatever, whenever. <br>
Asking me to pray for the past, however, is NOT something I<br>
see in the commonly-accepted canon. <br>
Further, I'm not convinced God altering the past would not be<br>
breaking His own rules of reality-allowing events to unfold<br>
in a linear fashion.  <br>
I'm suspicious of the entire subject as an interpolation of<br>
gnostic thought into Christianity.  I'm not afraid to discuss<br>
it, just leery of subscribing to it without what I consider<br>
sufficient evidence. <br>

Define commonly.  Orthodox and Catholics accept Maccabees and they make up the vast majority of Christians, and on top of that was commonly accepted by all up until Luther, means that the abridged canon of the Protestants is not the commonly accepted canon.<br>

Sorry about that.  I was trying to answer both you and WW at roughly the same time.  If you check out the thread on Purgatory that I started, it should roughly cover your two questions.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What is this judgment before God that we will face?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->But there is going to come a time of testing at the judgment day to see what kind of work each builder has done. Everyone's work will be put through the fire to see whether or not it keeps its value. If the work survives the fire, that builder will receive a reward. But if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss. The builders themselves will be saved, but like someone escaping through a wall of flames. (1Cor 3 13-15)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Where in the Bible does it say this will happen?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->One place would be here, &quot;it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment&quot; (Heb 9:27).<br>
<br>

The paragraph starts in verse 10, so I'll start there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>10</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it.  But each one should be careful how he builds.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>11</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>12</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>13</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light.  It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>14</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>15</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.<br>
(1 Cor. 3:10-15 NIV)<br>
<br>
That passage in 1 Cor. 3, in context is a warning about causing divisions in the church.  It says that the Lord will reveal the quality of our work, but this is something consistent throughout scripture.  We read passages that talk about storing up treasures in Heaven.  I don't have a clue what &quot;treasures in Heaven&quot; are, and I doubt any of us will until we get there.  But the point on that is - we're all saved, despite how many treasures we have, if we belong to Jesus.  And I could use the progression of the beattitudes here to help illustrate my point, but it's a rather long illustration.  The person with no treasures is just as much saved as the person who has built up many treasures.  And this passage in 1 Cor. states that.  Paul's basically warning these people to be productive so that their work is not in vain.  It's like with Cain and Able and the sacrifice God accepted and the sacrifice He rejected.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>One place would be here, &quot;it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment&quot; (Heb 9:27).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I guess I'm not fond of the term &quot;day of judgment&quot; because it sounds harsh.  But even Rev. 20 talks about the dead being judged.  The term sounds scary.  To be told that you are going to be judged by God someday - hey, I want to run and hide under the nearest rock.  To think of God's judgment coming down upon me - I tend to think of judgment as wrath.  Yet the Bible tells me not to fear because I belong to Jesus and even if I do nothing to extend the kingdom of Heaven and to store up treasures in Heaven, I know I'm still going to spend eternity with the Lord.  So there's comfort there.<br>
<br>
When 1 Cor. 3 says &quot;but only as one escaping through the flames&quot; in my translation or &quot;but like someone escaping through a wall of flames&quot; in your translation; what that tells me is that those are the Christians who did nothing to further the Kingdom of Heaven, who didn't store up any treasures in Heaven, and are as though they had just been saved and hadn't had the time yet to mature in their faith, whether they had just become Christians or had been Christians for many years.  It's no indication that they were punished for not doing good works in God's eyes.  It's symbolizing the level of their faith in Christ - they were still infants in the Lord as just before that paragraph, Paul wrote in 1 Cor. 3:2:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Paul is warning them that if they don't mature in their faith, then everything their doing isn't going to stand the test of God and when they finally face God, in regards to all other believers, they will be considered infants in the faith, as those just saved from the fires of hell who were not yet mature.<br>
<br>
But this is getting into aspects of Heaven and treasures in Heaven and maturity among believers and I honestly don't understand it.  I have no idea what &quot;treasures in Heaven&quot; will be.  I don't know what that means.  And basically that's because I don't understand how things will work in Heaven.  If anyone understands these things, please enlighten me.  I'm not sure exactly what works store treasures up in Heaven.  Is it just saving souls?  That makes me nervous because for as much as I've shared with people, I've never actually led a person to the Lord.  Which is a bummer really, because I'd really like to do that.  I don't know, this I'm sure should be a topic in and of itself.<br>

<br>
Personally, I LIKE the terms &quot;Judgement Day&quot; and <br>
&quot;Day of Judgement&quot;. <br>
I know some people have ascribed ominous overtones to<br>
the terms (like &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot;, a <br>
 frightening apocalyptic vision that must be stopped).<br>
However, I like the terms for 2 reasons of my own.<br>
<br>
A) Of all the terms in the Bible, these terms have been<br>
ascribed the least amount of baggage.  The term <br>
&quot;apocalypse&quot; comes from the term for &quot;revealing&quot; or <br>
&quot;unveiling&quot;-the unveiling of the events, which is the writing<br>
of the Book of Revelation. However, everyone here has<br>
heard people associate the term &quot;apocalypse&quot; with <br>
cataclysmic global disaster. (Not necessarily without <br>
reason.)  <br>
B) It's a simple term which I believe correctly reflects the<br>
events as outlined in Scripture, without adding in baggage<br>
of its own.  <br>
<br>
Anyone frightened of the judgement of God should remember<br>
that a judgement can go in your favour or against you.<br>
Neither direction is implied by the term &quot;judgement&quot; any<br>
more than &quot;a verdict was rendered&quot; tells you WHAT the<br>
verdict was.  Other terms used to refer to the same events,<br>
although translated from the same Greek words, carry FAR<br>
more baggage into English (&quot;condemnation&quot; and <br>
&quot;damnation&quot; are the ones I found, both translated from the<br>
EXACT same Greek words translated &quot;judgement&quot;).<br>
Also, if one is reluctant to face judgement of God, one should<br>
find out a bit more about this judgement-what its standards<br>
are, what its criteria are, what its possible consequences<br>
are.  If one is not happy with one's standing before God,<br>
they would do well to obey God more and defy Him less.<br>
I, for one, look forward to the Day of Judgement-at least,<br>
I look forward to my own.  (Then again, I'm a nut.)<br>
<br>
I'M NOT AIMING THAT AT ANYONE SPECIFIC, NEITHER HERE<br>
NOR ANYWHERE ELSE.  <br>
I was stating my general position and running thru the<br>
hypotheticals.  <br>
Personally, if I were to trade places with any of the posters<br>
here, I doubt I'd wake up in a sweat over the thought of the<br>
Judgement of God, either. So, there!<br>
<br>
So, that's why I like the terms.  Feel free to disagree with<br>
me.  <br>
<br>
=========================<br>
Esdras,<br>
can you please cut-and-paste your last points on this<br>
thread into the other one? <br>
I'd love to address them there, I think they're more than<br>
appropriate there, and I think they are necessary for the<br>
discussion there.<br>
<br>
Peaches, if I have my druthers, we'll address I Cor 3 on that<br>
very thread as well, and I'm looking forward to it.<br>
(Then again, I'm a nut.)<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a little acorn,<br>
That much is plain to see.<br>
It's also true the mighty oak<br>
Was once a nut like me.<br>
Sometimes you feel like a nut,<br>
Sometimes you don't.&quot;<br>

Actually, what I really feel frightened by is your spelling. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   There's no e in the word judgment. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (The being frightened by your spelling is just some fun teasing.)<br>
<br>
I think it's because the Bible warns so strictly against us judging others and it's considered preferable if we don't have to go into court and face a judge for things we have done - it makes the word &quot;judgment&quot; seem very dark and very negative.  So it's harder for me to remind myself that God's judgment is good.  But then at the same time, there is a healthy fear of the Lord.  To recognize His holiness in light of my sinfulness - standing in His judgment doesn't sound like a pleasurable thing.  Though the Bible gives promises to those of us who belong to Him that we have nothing to fear if we belong to Jesus.  But the fear of the Lord in recognizing His holiness in contrast to our sinfulness is quite overwhelming - at least it is for me.  As much as I call God &quot;Daddy&quot; and blow kisses to Him at night, I do believe I have that healthy fear of the Lord in me that I never lose sight of His power and might and awesomeness.<br>
<br>
Rather than Judgment Day, I like the way 1 Cor. 1:8 words it in the NIV.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I like calling it &quot;The Day of the Lord&quot; rather than &quot;Judgment Day.&quot;  To me, Judgment Day just has too many negative connotations to it.  But to say &quot;The Day of the Lord&quot; sounds good - because God is good.  And to say &quot;The Day of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; is better because the Bible says that that every spirit who acknowledges Jesus for who He is acknowledges God.  Not everyone who believes in God acknowledges Jesus. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">**********************************************<br>
