He had been following some tracks all the way from Lorien, when the watchouts saw some orcs coming down from Moria. They knew they would be up to no good, in the direction of Gondor, so he packed as quickly as possible, and followed them. He had followed at a safe distance, because he could not take the whole group himself, he was hoping to get help from Gondor troops. Mesulod was weary, but there was a village he had stopped at before where his horse could rest. The orcs were a few hours ahead of him, and he had to get support quickly if he would be able to catch up to the group and attack them. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We'll see what tommorow brings..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought as he kept on riding. <p><br>

He only wanted to take a nice ride in the forest, but nooooo, his horse would not relax and kneel for him. After what seemed like forever, he got onto the horse and rode off. A few hours ago, he saw some orcs ride by, but they did not look like they were running from anything. As he reached the edge of the forest, he rode out into the plains and began riding. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw an elf riding at full speed straight for him! &quot;ARGH!!!!&quot; He ran into the elf...the elf stood up, and brushed himself. &quot;Are you alright, dwarf?&quot;  &quot;Yes, I am fine, why in carnation are you riding so fast?&quot; there was a long pause...&quot;I am chasing down some orcs, the rest i cannot say&quot; &quot;Well, I have nothing better to do, but I saw them go that way&quot; Gailindor pointed to the hills ahead of them. &quot;Thank you, dwarf, I will be on my way.&quot; As he began to ride off, Gailindor yelled, &quot;Is there a need for help?&quot; The elf turned, and pondered for a moment, then spoke. &quot;Wait here for the night, then head to the village ahead of us to meet my party. You can come with us from there&quot; Gailindor nodded, and turned to get back on his horse. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He was going to travel with elves!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought, and began to attempt to get back on his horse... <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

If the dwarf turned around, he would see an old-enough looking man, holding a length of rope which was attached to an evil-looking donkey. The only part of his face not covered in hair was the space between his eyes and the bottom of his nose. He was wearing a ragged set of clothes: shirt, waiscoat, dusty breeches, and boots. &quot;And what are a dwarf, and an elf doing in my woods?&quot; he says, smiling faintly. &quot;Surely you didn't come together? And that elf was in pursuit of orcs, did he say? Well well, suddenly things are exciting here, are they?&quot; He thrusts a hand out to the dwarf, in the way of the common folk of the area, &quot;Riddlefish is my name, at yer service, and yer family's, as you dwarfs say.&quot; <p>Zirandorthel<br>

He wanted someone to be out there, instead of creepy and dark. He looked over at his party. Strange how they all came together, three different species, all traveling together, not knowing what is ahead. But, they approached the village, together and ready, which is a hard trait to find amongst middle earthians. However, there was still the Elf's goal at mind, to find the orcs. Ever since his family passed (Orc Raid), he was lost, and looking for vengeance at the same time. These thoughts had crossed his mind many times before, and the answer presented itself as the elf. And so, he turned to the elf and said, &quot;I am with you till the end my friend&quot;... <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

Gostin leaned on his bo-stick his favoite possession he would wait, he was always very curious, I guess that's how he survived the attacks.  He went into his Uncle's new basement to look it over.  That's when the hordes ravaged the place and left him  here alone.  The Riders where a welcome site.. he had never traveled on his own and didn't know what what to do.<br>

The guards in a little village had left to stop the orcish armies. This gave Tauron a good chance to pillage that village and create a blood spillage. He had to be weary though. Although generally Orcs and Trolls didn't fight each other, he had deserted the army and the Orcs were after him. He decided to await nightfall and attack the village from the east and then escape out in the north without being spotted. But before he attacked, he had to make sure there was no one and so he decided to conduct a little recon operation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zirandorthel>Zirandorthel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Friend</span><br> <font color=#FF9300>(6/25/03 2:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CAPTURE!!!</span><hr size=1> Riddlefish grinned at the elf, &quot;Aye, and I have not,&quot; he said. &quot;My given name, I do not remember, it has disappeared in the mists of time.

The door to the house was left wide open, and some of the windows were shattered. &quot;It is as I feared. Ride on to the village with all haste!&quot; <p><br>

Quickly, he whirled towards the corner with his sword ready to strike, and stood poised. Then, his sword dropped to the floor. He looked at the corner and saw it was a human body, decapatated and pinned to the wall with a black spear. The head on the ground was hewn with orc writings.  <p><br>

They were savage, crude-looking shafts, and when Riddlefish tried to pull them out, he had to rip them free of the dead woman's flesh. They were wickedly barbed. &quot;Orcs,&quot; he whispered, his face grim. Suddenly he looked more fiercesome, his face resolute and serious, his eyes no longer twinkling but glinting with a contained rage. He walked back to his donkey, who had shied away from the smell of death that hung about the shed, and felt in its saddlebags. He gritted his teeth, and drew out a scabbarded sword from under the rest of the baggage. Buckling this to his belt, he led the donkey off, searching for his new companions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Scrolls<br>
