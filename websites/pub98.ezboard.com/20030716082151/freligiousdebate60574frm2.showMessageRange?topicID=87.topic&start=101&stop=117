In 1995, the First Presidency came out with The Family: A Proclamation to The World. In it it states:<br>
<br>
The family is ordained of God. Marriage between a man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness,respect, love, compassion, work and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.<br>

Why?  What need has god of property right contracts between his pet humans?  Essentially a marriage is a property right contract for support and exclusive breeding rights.  Does this serve god in some way?  I fail to see how, he made adam and eve but he didn’t marry them in the garden, so why once he has cast us out and fears our power does he need us to contract our relations?  Could it be that the property right contract was an important part of society and the need to control the females into obedience to their husbands so that the contracts would be kept and thus economic ties maintained was important to ancient culture?  Was the social bonds made by marriage more important then the human rights they tromped all over?  Are we now 4000 years later romanticizing it into something so we don’t get all erratic over it now?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> This is an implicit impeachment of unwed parenting.  Yet single parenting is far more prevalent in xian homes than in atheist ones.  How odd.  I know couples that are not married but have been together for decades and their kids are fine.  I also know married couples that are awful and the children are far worse for being forced to live in an acrimonious home.  How condescendingly presumptuous that there is only one road to Rome and all others inferior or defective.<br>

The marriages founded on Christ fail far more frequently than those of atheist origin.  Furthermore, the self-righteous word <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wholesome</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is itself an ambiguous and threatening term.

What design makes a man superior?  Are they inherently more intelligent than women?  Do they lead because they are smarter?  Stronger?  Wiser?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BULLSHIT!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If god designed man to lead, then men would be smarter.  Here’s a fact for you, the highest intelligence population is 2/3 more frequently male than female.  Does that validate god’s design if men are smarter?  Here’s another fact for you, the lowest intelligence population is 2/3 more frequently male than female.  How does that add up?  It implies that intellegence is a female sex linked trait and the women by virtue of having 2 chromosomes to the man’s one have a more normalized (less extreme) IQ range.  Net result?  Overall equals across the population.  What a crappy engineer god is to set it up like that when he could have just made it a MALE sex linked trait and then men would logically rule by virtue of greater intelligence.  <br>
<br>
How about some fiscal logic?  If my wife is an accountant or a tax attorney who the hell am I the golf pro to tell her what to do with the money?  Shouldn’t I listen to her greater expertise and respect the skills she brings that I lack?  What if she is a successful news caster and makes $250K a year and I am a toll booth attendant making $19K, should I knock her up and make her quit to be a mommy because I am male and must provide for the family?  That would be a divorce from sensibility.  It makes me sick to see such total abdication from personal responsibility and cognitive diligence.  I am amazed that xians think themselves remotely moral at all if everything good comes from god’s design and everything bad is of Satan, then what do you actually contribute?  You are pawns being moved by invisible hands and pretending it is freewill, yet it is really freewill and you just scapegoat your personal irresponsibility.<br>
<br>
Quit kicking the equal rights and protections of others in the groin and act like equals.  Take personal responsibility and carry your weight like so many generations of hard working, intelligent and amazing women have done.  You disrespect their efforts and painfully won equality and I would question your deserving the fruits of their labors.  Just like the rewards of science, the fruit of secular labor is shared unselfishly with all, unlike your petty gods torturous sadism.<br>

I don't think anyone expected you to buy into our beliefs about our families. When I posted the link to the submission article, I was merely hoping you would read it and respect that it is how some view their marriages. I never expected you to accept, agree, or understand it. I think by the same token, the women who posted the LDS stand on families (which I think sums it up pretty darn well even though I'm not LDS) also would merely ask for respect about their beliefs - not agreement or acceptance. You know, I don't understand why so many people (men and women) have such a hard time with women who WANT to stay home and raise their children. Take me for instance ... I'm quite educated (BA, teaching credential, Master's degree); heck, I teach part-time at a college. And yet, I choose to spend the majority of my time home with my son. There is no other place I would rather be, no other job I would rather have, than raising him, and I am so grateful that we are financially finally in a place where I can work as little as I do and still get by. But, I would never tell another woman that she must do the same. My cousin, for one, equally as educated, has decided to return to work and have her children in day care. Who am I to judge what she does? Who are you or anyone else to judge what I decide to do? I do not think I am mocking the equal rights advocates, nor am I not carrying my own weight (if you think staying home is a plush job, think again). My dh and I have chosen what works for our family. Yes, I wish all wives/moms had the same opportunity and desire - how wonderful for our children to be raised, 24 hours a day, by their mom (or dad) instead of another caregiver. I used to teach elementary school and the kids that had to go to daycare afterschool hated it. All they wanted was to go home - to their home. But, just because those parents, for whatever reason, chose otherwise, does not make them bad parents at all. Me choosing to stay home with my son does not make me a bad &quot;woman&quot; - I only ask that others respect my decisions as I respect theirs. <br>

I'm not slaving - I'm home, he's not, it has to get done. I'm not going to say, &quot;You do all the housework when you get home because I'm not your slave.&quot; As well, I cook 90% of the time, typically because I enjoy cooking and don't enjoy eating most of what dh cooks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (unless he bbq's). He, though, does all the dishes. When he gets home from work, he takes the baby (I guess he's technically a toddler), and lets me have some free time. When it comes to decisions, more often than not, he defers to me because he usually likes my suggestions more than his own. But, if there is a time where we can't agree on something, I defer to him. Why get in an argument over it? Someone has to give sometimes; I make an effort to give. (And to be honest, there are many more times when he makes the effort to give in to me instead.) Point being, we are not a &quot;master-slave&quot; couple. We are equals in our relationship. But, there will come a time where someone has to have the final say in something ... I choose to let him have it (though not all the time, I can be pretty stubborn!). <br>
<br>
Again, not expecting you to agree with me or accept what I'm saying. But, I ask that you try to respect our decisions and choices. <br>

God said  Gen.2:18  It is not good that the man should be alone;  I will make him an help meet for him.  Prov. 18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord. <br>
<br>
How do you explain Eph. 5:22-23 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  For the husband is the HEAD of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. vs 33  Nevertheless let everyone of you in particular so love his wife even as himself: and the wife see that she reverence her husband.  (if your not sure what reverence means look it up)<br>
Don't argue with me about the womens role in life.  I didn't write the book.  God did.  Women in this day and age have a real hard time placing themselves under a man.  They want to be just like them in everything they do.  God did not make us the same we are different and we have different roles.  The women is the weaker vessel<br>
1Peter 3:1-  Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;.........  (subjection defined in websters 1828 dict.=<br>
the act of subduning; the act of vanquishing and brining under the dominion of another.  the state of being under the power, control and government of another.) (I didnt write the book<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
Verse 6-7 Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord:  whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.  Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowlege, giving HONOUR unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life;  that your prayers be not hindered.<br>
<br>
About the unequally yoked?  I'm interested in what you think that means.   2Cor. 6:14  Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath rightousness with unrighteousness?  and what communion hath light with darkness?     To me this simply says you souldn't marry someone who is not a believer or have a best friend who is not a believer because for what fellowship hath rightousness with unrighteousness?  They will not look at issues in the same light.  One is living there life for the Lord, and the other one is living their life for themselves and the devil.<br>

You have this superiority complex that rivals that of your average fundi.  You claim open mindedness, but if it can't be &quot;proven&quot; according to your formula then it must be trash.  If some of the greatest minds had refused to think outside the box we wouldn't be where we are now.<br>
<br>
Do I think family is important?  Absolutely.  Do I claim that my family is somehow better because it fits a stereotype of a working dad, stay home mom, 1 ds, 1 dd and a dog?  Absolutely NOT!  I firmly believe that the values this society needs (integrity, work ethics, laughter, honor, tolerance, love etc) are best taught in the home.  I happen to think it's horrible that the state of Florida was trying to keep a gay couple from adopting the children they had raised from birth.  Whatever your family looks like, it is still the source of most of what our children will learn and hang on to as the grow.  Of course people can break away from disfunction (my mom is a prime example) and of course people will fall into it (my brother).   Yes, people will divorce, and remarry.  We'll always have abusers and victims.  But if we had strong family values, we might be able to raise children who can avoid abusive situations, etc.  <br>
<br>
If you must know, I do the finances in our home.  I also bring in a source of income (freelance photography and private piano lessons).  Dh and I share responsibilities around the house and with our kids.  We make decisions together.  I've never felt inferior to him.  What we believe works for us, and who are you to say we're wrong?<br>

I agree that sites produced by LDS are naturally biased in the direction of our church.   And those who have evaluated JS based on the historical literature written by those who hated him/disliked him etc. were also biased against the church.  And apparently I was right.  In surfing and looking for something that talked about the histories, I thought I had found a site that had evaluated both pro and anti historical writings and had recommended BH Roberts as a pretty fair and comprehensive historian despite his being LDS.  As it turns out, I was wrong.  The second link is filled with basic inaccurasies.  The story for example that God has mulitple wives.  No where in our doctrine does anyone presume to know whether God has one wife or many.<br>
<br>
The idea that blacks were neutral in the war in heaven, at best may have been a personal specualtion made by an LDS member. DEFI NITELY NOT doctrine.<br>

<br>
Well poo. We may just reach a point where the best sites possible have to be used with an eye to bias. This is the case with just about every historical document used to research anything. Everyone has an agenda or perspective that causes some degree of bias, but some are better than others or can be used anyway if one keeps the source and time period in mind.<br>
<br>
I continue to argue though, that the most objective sources to be found do not support in any way the claims of JS, and in fact, tend to discredit him and his claims. Perhaps this would be more true of JC too if he had lived more recently.<br>

It takes a person willing to surrender her equality and rights to one who &quot;makes the decisions, but considers her opinion&quot;. This is what parents do with children, not how adults who are on equal ground interact in the world at all.
