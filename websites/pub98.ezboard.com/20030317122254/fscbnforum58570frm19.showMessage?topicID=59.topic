<br>
Once again, it was a test of his will just to maintain his composure.<br>
<br>
He had been screwed. Again.<br>
<br>
Who was responsible? <br>
<br>
Hunters? Certainly Santa Carla had plenty of those, but then, why track him instead of outright killing him? They obviously didn't need him to lure them to other Kindred. They could've killed Crowley and the bastard Brujah with him. <br>
<br>
Jason Black? The Gangrel was renowned for his technical abilities, certainly the chip's intricate nature exactly the kind of device he'd come up with. But there was the same problem with the hunters; why not kill him? Regardless of the Justicar's &quot;mercy&quot;, Crowley had no illusions that if Jay Black wanted him dead, he would die. <br>
<br>
The Giovanni? He had taken great pains to prevent the necromancers from uncovering his investigations into this ghoul business, but he knew there was always a risk of discovery. But still, would this be their response? They didn't need such a device to track him; they had Wraiths for that.<br>
<br>
The other Kindred of Santa Carla? <br>
<br>
Crowley's head pounded. He had come to this city to help these people, and now they considered him an outcast. A criminal. Really, little better than an unacknowledged Anarch. No, worse than that. An Anarch, at least started at “0”. Crowley knew he was in negative territory. <br>
<br>
And why had that Brujah insisted on speaking to him before the Populace meeting? <br>
<br>
Crowley’s hands traveled to the back of his neck. It would be so easy. All he had to do was reach his fingernails in and tear. And this would all be over. These people could do as they wished. He could embrace the void and be rid of all of them. <br>
<br>
Then he closed his eyes, and once again he saw the light. <br>
<br>
He opened them again. Damn it. <br>
<br>
Something was pushing him forward, and it wouldn’t let him go. It would drag him through the mud until he eventually met whatever fate had in store for him.<br>
<br>
“Sink or swim” he muttered. There’d be no getting out of the water.<br>
<br>
So they wanted to track him, observe him, amuse themselves with him. <br>
<br>
Fine. Let them. <br>
<br>
So they wanted to monitor his behavior, make sure he was being a “good boy”.<br>
<br>
That’s fine. Crowley would just keep right on doing what he had been doing since he first came to the city; do what he felt was for the best.<br>
<br>
If he were to be damned, he’d be damned for what he was.<br>
<br>
Really, the only thing he had left was what was in his core. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, that did not make his experience any less painful.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Crowley did possess something else that would. <br>
<br>
A knock came at the door. <br>
<br>
“You wanted to see me, Mr. Crowley?” <br>
<br>
“Yes, Sebastian, please come in and sit down.” Crowley smiled. A young, ambitious broker, Sebastian Andrews had proven to be an excellent hire for Crowley’s investment firm, keeping the in-house books tidy and clean. He made an excellent member of Crowley’s herd, perhaps someday Crowley would even make him a ghoul. After that, who knows? Crowley had never thought much about Embracing a childe, but he knew that the time would come when it would become expected of him. <br>
<br>
Crowley reached inside his desk and pulled out a bottle of vodka.<br>
<br>
“Drink with me, Sebastian.” Crowley said, as he poured Andrews and himself a glass.<br>
<br>
Andrews accepted the glass. “Why… thank you, sir.” <br>
<br>
“Tell me, how goes the Anderson account?”<br>
<br>
“Very well, sir. We’re rolling the funds into the foreign currency markets, most of them with substantial gains. Even in those rare instances where we’ve suffered some losses, they’re completely tax-deductible.” <br>
<br>
“Mmm-hmmm. Very good.” Crowley nodded, barely listening to him. “And that little Union problem we had down in Mexico?”<br>
<br>
“The chemical factory? Yes, sir, its been taken care of. A few bribes to some key officials were all that were needed to keep the lines moving.” Andrews finished his glass.<br>
<br>
“Sebastian,” Crowley said looking directly into his employee’s eyes “Please. Keep drinking”<br>
<br>
The two men continued to talk into the night, laughing and, at least in Andrews’ case, drinking.<br>
<br>
Andrews, usually a stickler for noticing discrepancies, never seemed to notice Crowley never touched his drink. <br>
<br>

<br>
Two hours later….<br>
<br>
Crowley licked Andrews puncture wounds shut. Poor lad had passed out from too much alcohol, and Crowley had taken his fill. Odds were that erasing his memories when he awoke wouldn’t even be necessary, but Crowley would do it anyway. No sense taking chances, and certainly not now. <br>
<br>
Crowley stood up. At least it was working; he could hardly feel anything… except a tingling sensation…<br>
<br>
“Huh. Must’ve taken too much blood…” Crowley thought. “I feel… fuzzy…” <br>
<br>
“Crowley”<br>
<br>
Crowley looked around wildly. Who said that??? Andrews was definitely out of it. There was no one else in the room. The walls were soundproof. Where did it come from?<br>
<br>
“Crowley, over here.” <br>
<br>
What? Crowley recognized the voice now, but it couldn’t be him. The speaker was… dead.<br>
<br>
Crowley walked over to the wall and looked straight at the Luger, on its display stand. <br>
<br>
“Mr. Roche?”<br>
<br>
“Good to see your observant as ever.” The sarcastic voice of Kaergon Roche responded. “Now, then. We have much to discuss.”<br>
<br>
“But Mr. Roche, your… dead… aren’t you?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, Crowley, I’m dead. And you will be too if you don’t sharpen up.”<br>
<br>
“How are you doing this?” <br>
<br>
“Force of will, perhaps? Does it really matter?” Roche’s voice answered. “What matters is I’m here, and in this new capacity, I actually have time to talk to you. Eternity, in fact, though I must say if it takes that long to get through to you, I may very well go insane.” <br>
<br>
The shock drained from Crowley’s face and was replaced by sorrow and discontent. <br>
<br>
“We failed, sir.” Crowley lamented. “All of our planning and sacrifices were for nothing.”<br>
<br>
“Crowley,” Roche’s voice said, “You’re mistaken. We accomplished exactly what we set out to do.”<br>
<br>
Crowley stood there, stunned. <br>
<br>
“How can you say that, sir?” Crowley exclaimed. “You -- you’re dead! Rahman and Ryder as well! Others have been blood hunted into exile, the rest of us are disgraced! It’s been nothing but a disaster!”<br>
<br>
There was a moment of silence, and Crowley could almost swear he heard the gun sigh.<br>
<br>
“Crowley, look at the city as it stands tonight. Its back to being a Camarilla city, with a strong Camarilla leadership based on leading by right, not might. Oh, there’s the occasional grumbling such as this business with the Giovanni, but for the most part, it’s an overwhelmingly safer place. A place where Kindred, even yourself, can set themselves up in society and reap the rewards.”<br>
<br>
“But what about those of us who made this all possible?”<br>
<br>
“Unfortunately, Crowley, sacrifices sometimes need to be made, and in this case, that meant us. There were political ramifications of my decision I did not appreciate at the time, as well as the personal actions and agendas of a few individuals. As a result, the price was rather high, indeed. If I could do it all over again, certainly there are details I would have changed. But if you’re asking me if we made the right, there is no question.”<br>
<br>
“And the Prince?” asked Crowley.<br>
<br>
“Ah, yes, beautiful, lovely Marie,” Roche replied wistfully. “I feel she has many desirable… attributes in a leader. She has made many excellent decisions, and the city will continue to benefit from her leadership for some time to come. I do think she’ll come to regret her decision to retract my ban on the Gangrel learning celerity, but don’t tell her I said so.”<br>
<br>
Crowley paused, uncertainly.<br>
<br>
“For one, its rarely a good idea to outright question a Prince’s decision. I certainly never cared for it during my brief time in office.” Roche clarified. “Another thing, if you tell her dead Kindred are speaking to you, she might lose what little patience she has left and see that you’re killed or exiled.” <br>
<br>
Crowley nodded. He could now feel the alcohol running through his bloodstream. Right. Telling people he was hearing Kaergon’s voice from beyond the grave would be a bad idea.<br>
<br>
Crowley sighed. “But so many have benefited from what we did, and now they hate and ridicule us. The Prince, Blackmore…”<br>
<br>
“Grifon Blackmore” Kaergan interrupted. “Did exactly what any proper Ventrue should do. He sat back, calmly and neutrally, doing his job, and when the time was right, he acted. As a result, he now stands in a position of great power. Learn from that.”<br>
<br>
Crowley nodded. Deep down, he knew Roche was right. <br>
<br>
“One last thing before I take my leave of you, for now. These grudges you’ve been nursing, this need for vengeance…” <br>
<br>
Crowley winced. <br>
<br>
“You know about…”<br>
<br>
“Crowley, consider where I’m speaking from. I know everything. Remember, revenge is a luxury claimed by Clans like the Lasombra. It is a selfish desire that consumes the individual and clouds your judgment. Not only should you avoid that path, you should avoid those who follow it. Had we done this when we removed Nikke, most of our difficulties could’ve probably been avoided. Unfortunately, we did not, and the actions of others lead to our current respective situations.” <br>
<br>
Crowley’s body contorted, all the pain and humiliation he had endured flooded back to him. Roche was right. He could feel it eating away at all that was left of him. Once that core was gone, he would collapse and be destroyed. There was only one way to survive, and that was by letting go.<br>
<br>
He got to his feet.<br>
<br>
“Mr. Roche,” Crowley said, “I vow in your presence that I forsake vengeance against all who have wronged me. I will act for the needs of this city – my city, and my clan.”<br>
<br>
“Melodramatically stated, but good.” Kaergan said. “I approve. You have a long road ahead of you, Crowley. But at least tonight, I think, you’ve taken the first step, and taking that step may allow you to proceed along that road. Don’t worry; I’ll be there along the way to help you proceed down this path. If you’re lucky, I might even tell you how to take that vile little piece of metal out of your head.” <br>
<br>
“Wait, before you go, tell me. Why did you come to me, and not somebody else?”<br>
<br>
When the voice answered it was barely more than a whisper.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps because you needed it the most.” Kaergan said. “Or perhaps its because you’re the only one still listening…”<br>
<br>
And then he was gone. <br>
<br>
A wave of nausea hit Crowley, and he nearly regurgitated the blood he had earlier drained. There was a feeling, an aftertaste in fact, a sensation he had not experienced since….<br>
<br>
Crowley walked over to where Andrews was lying and emptied the man’s pants pockets. Wallet, keys, pager, no. Then he checked the pockets on his jacket.<br>
<br>
Ah.<br>
<br>
Crowley pulled the bag of crank out and laid it on his desk. This was disappointing on many different levels. Crowley felt he took better care in selecting his employees. Drug use had obviously not been one of his criteria for searching out the best and brightest. Crowley had only extracted the benefits of a drug-induced feeding decades before, not long after his Embrace. His Sire had turned him away from that, and shown him that power was not only the best aphrodisiac, it was the only aphrodisiac. <br>
<br>
Or so he had believed ever since.<br>
<br>
“Well, Mr. Roche,” Crowley laughed. “If I ever need to speak to you again, I’ll know exactly how to reach you.”<br>
<br>
It was a pity about Andrews, though. He’d have to dispose of the young man and…<br>
<br>
Well….<br>
<br>
It would be a shame to lose an excellent employee. Keeping him would not only provide his company with an excellent resource, it might also give Crowley a contact into the street and underworld influences which seemed to be critical areas in the run of this city.<br>
<br>
Crowley turned and looked back at the gun. <br>
<br>
And, he supposed, it wasn’t inconceivable that he might make personal use of Sebastian’s… resources again….<br>
