Most a/a's are looking for proof in order to believe something.  I tend to believe on faith.  When something feels right, by what I believe to be the Holy Spirit, I believe it.  I realized recently though, that not all Christians feel the same way as I do.  Through many discussions that dh and I have had with certain Christians.  We have found that they want proof too.  But not scientific proof.  Biblical proof.  These people believe that the Bible is true, because the Bible says it's true.  They won't believe anything unless it is proven to them with biblical scripture.  (even then, it has to be their interpretation, but that's a whole different thread).  I was told once that I couldn't believe in my feelings/concience/Spirit because our heart deceives us (according to Isaiah).  I wondered why it was wrong for me to believe my heart while it was okay for this other person to believe theirs.  But, now I think that this person wants proof, not faith.  The Bible must be true....after all, it says it is! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Believing the bible to be truth because it SAYS it's truth is circular logic. <br>
It's like me standing here holding a sign saying &quot;I am telling the truth--the earth is flat&quot;. <br>
Just because I SAY I'm telling the truth doesn't mean I am telling the truth. <br>
And just because I believe it to be true doesn't make it so.<br>
I can only speak for myself, and not every atheist or agnostic, but I am not looking for &quot;proof&quot; to believe in a deity. Proof is relative. What is &quot;proof&quot; of god to you is not proof to me. Know what I mean?<br>
Faith is, by definition, belief of something that there is no evidence for. If there were evidence for the existance of a deity, it wouldn't be called faith. <br>
<br>
Alright, it's new years eve, I've had an absolutely horrific day, and I can't explain myself well, so I'm going to post this little parody thing that explains (thought flippantly) how I feel about the Bible being touted as &quot;proof&quot;. <br>
Bear with me, I've had a few shots of jagermeister/goldshlager tonight.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kissing Hank's Ass<br>

This morning there was a knock at my door. When I answered the door I found a well groomed, nicely dressed couple. The man spoke first:<br>
<br>
This morning there was a knock at my door. When I answered the door I found a well groomed, nicely dressed couple. The man spoke first:<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi! I'm John, and this is Mary.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;Hi! We're here to invite you to come kiss Hank's ass with us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Pardon me?! What are you talking about? Who's Hank, and why would I want to kiss his ass?&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;If you kiss Hank's ass, he'll give you a million dollars; and if you don't, he'll kick the shit out of you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;What? Is this some sort of bizarre mob shake-down?&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;Hank is a billionaire philanthropists. Hank built this town. Hank owns this town. He can do what ever wants, and what he wants is to give you a million dollars, but he can't until you kiss his ass.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;That doesn't make any sense. Why...&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;Who are you to question Hank's gift? Don't you want a million dollars? Isn't it worth a little kiss on the ass?&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Well maybe, if it's legit, but...&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;Then come kiss Hank's ass with us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Do you kiss Hank's ass often?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;Oh yes, all the time...&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;And has he given you a million dollars?&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;Well no, you don't actually get the money until you leave town.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;So why don't you just leave town now?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;You can't leave until Hank tells you to, or you don't get the money and he kicks the shit out of you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Do you know anyone who kissed Hank's ass, left town, and got the million dollars?&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;My mother kissed Hank's ass for years. She left town last year, and I'm sure she got the money.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Haven't you talked to her since then?&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;Of course not, Hank doesn't allow it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;So what makes you think he'll actually give you the money if you've never talked to anyone who got the money?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;Well, he gives you a little bit before you leave. Maybe you'll get a raise, maybe you'll win a small lotto, maybe you'll just find a twenty dollar bill on the street.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;What's that got to do with Hank?&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;Hank has certain 'connections.'&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;I'm sorry, but this sounds like some sort of bizarre con game.&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;But it's a million dollars, can you really take the chance? And remember, if you don't kiss Hank's ass he'll kick the shit of you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Maybe if I could see Hank, talk to him, get the details straight from him...&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;No one sees Hank, no one talks to Hank.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Then how do you kiss his ass?&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;Sometimes we just blow him a kiss, and think of his ass. Other times we kiss Karl's ass, and he passes it on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Who's Karl?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;A friend of ours. He's the one who taught us all about kissing Hank's ass. All we had to do was take him out to dinner a few times.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;And you just took his word for it when he said there was a Hank, that Hank wanted you to kiss his ass, and that Hank would reward you?&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;Oh no! Karl's got a letter Hank sent him years ago explaining the whole thing. Here's a copy; see for your self.&quot;<br>
<br>
John handed me a photocopy of a handwritten memo on &quot;From the desk of Karl&quot; letterhead. There were eleven items listed:<br>
<br>
From the desk of: KARL<br>
<br>
1.Kiss Hank's ass and he'll give you a million dollars when you leave town.<br>
2.Use alcohol in moderation.<br>
3.Kick the shit out of people who aren't like you.<br>
4.Eat right.<br>
5.Hank dictated this list himself.<br>
6.The moon is made of green cheese.<br>
7.Everything Hank says is right.<br>
8.Wash your hands after going to the bathroom.<br>
9.Don't drink.<br>
10.Eat your wieners on buns, no condiments.<br>
11.Kiss Hank's ass or he'll kick the shit out of you.<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;This would appear to be written on Karl's Letterhead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;Hank didn't have any paper.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;I have a hunch that if we checked we'd find this is Karl's handwriting.&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;Of course, Hank dictated it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;I thought you said no one gets to see Hank?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;Not now, but years ago he would talk to some people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;I thought you said he was a philanthropist. What sort of philanthropist kicks the shit out of people just because they're different?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;It's what Hank wants, and Hank's always right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;How do you figure that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;Item 7 says 'Everything Hank says is right.' That's good enough for me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Maybe your friend Karl just made the whole thing up.&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;No way! Item 5 says 'Hank dictated this list himself.' Besides, item 2 says 'Use alcohol in moderation,' Item 4 says 'Eat right,' and item 8 says 'Wash your hands after going to the bathroom.' Everyone knows those things are right, so the rest must be true too.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;But 9 says 'Don't Drink,' which doesn't quite go with item 2, and 6 says 'The moon is made of green cheese,' which is just plain wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;There's no contradiction between 9 and 2, 9 just clarifies 2. As far as 6 goes, you've never been to the moon, so you can't say for sure.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;Scientists have pretty firmly established that the moon is made of rock...&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;But they don't know if the rock came from the Earth, or from outer of space, so it could just as easily be green cheese.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;I'm not really an expert, but I think the theory that the Moon came from the Earth has been discounted. Besides, not knowing where the rock came from doesn't make it cheese.&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;Aha! You just admitted that scientists make mistakes, but we know Hank is always right!&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;We do?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary: &quot;Of course we do, Item 5 says so.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;You're saying Hank's always right because the list says so, the list is right because Hank dictated it, and we know that Hank dictated it because the list says so. That's circular logic. That's no different than saying 'Hank's right because he says he's right.'&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;Now you're getting it! It's so rewarding to see someone come around to Hank's way of thinking!&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;But... oh, never mind. What's the deal with wieners?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary blushes. John says: &quot;Wieners, in buns, no condiments. It's Hank's way. Anything else is wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;What if I don't have a bun?&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;No bun, no wiener. A wiener without a bun is wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;No relish? No Mustard?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary looks positively stricken. John shouts: &quot;There's no need for such language! Condiments of any kind are wrong!&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;So a big pile of sauerkraut with some wieners chopped up in it would be out of the question?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary sticks her fingers in her ears: &quot;I am not listening to this. La la la la la la la la.&quot;<br>
<br>
John: &quot;That's disgusting. Only some sort of evil deviant would eat that...&quot;<br>
<br>
Me: &quot;It's good! I eat it all the time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mary faints. John catches her: &quot;Well, if I'd known you where one of those, I wouldn't have wasted my time. When Hank kicks the shit out of you, I'll be there counting my money and laughing. I'll kiss Hank's ass for you, you bunless cut-wienered kraut-eater.&quot;<br>
<br>
With this, John dragged Mary to their waiting car, and sped off.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

That make sense in the same way the love makes sense. There is no &quot;proof&quot; that love exists, but we feel it therefore it is real to us. <br>
<br>
I'm was raised agnostic, became a xian/Catholic and held on to that faith for about 6 years. My faith was based on feeling alone, because the bible is loaded with contradictions so to say it is &quot;true&quot; well, you've got to dismiss many things or it's all insanity IMO. And if the bible is loaded, well, the Catholic Church is just, hmm, don't wanna offend anybody... Anyway,  I felt I was ignoring a LOT of what my intellect was telling me in order to believe in God and Jesus. Kind of like ignoring all the signs that my (now ex) husband was cheating until one day I opened my eyes, accepted the undeniable and filed for divorce.<br>
<br>
Where I get stuck is why, if Jesus is the &quot;answer&quot;, are so many (but by no means &quot;all&quot;) Christians mean spirited, bigoted, judgmental and so on? Often worse, it seems, than people of other religions or no religion? I realize they are human, but if they have the &quot;answer&quot;, how can they be like that?<br>
<br>
When I stopped feeling God in my heart, when I prayed and never got an answer, that made it impossible for me to believe anymore. Kind of like falling out of love! Then I looked at the facts and the realities of life (such as, if my conscience can't even sustain a strong blow to the head, how can it sustain death?) and I became an atheist. <br>

<br>
When I was Christian, I was one of those that believed that the bible was true (because I was told that it was). As I did my little bible studies (I have one of those nifty student bibles), I started having questions, but those questions were answered by the typical answers from the pastors I would ask. Eventually, instead of just dismissing my own questions, I began to build on them (Certain things that just did not make sense ~ like following certain things in the OT and not others). When I went to college and started taking some &quot;history and religion&quot; type classes, I baiscally decided that the bible was fallable (sp). At that point, I was still a very devout Christian, but I could not let my intellect suffer any more (kwim?)<br>
<br>
I feel that some people (going all the way back to the first pope and some of those bishops of that time) are just so desperate to believe everything in the bible, that they will accept any alternate theory out there that supports their beliefs like dinosaurs being planted by Satan, or the earth being only 6000 years old  (Each day in Genesis is actually equal to 1000 years. I do not remember where the verse is, but there is a verse in the OT that says &quot;a day is to a thousand years&quot; and that is where they get that from). As each arguement comes along, it will go from blasphomy, to doubtful, to maybe true, to OK... it's true... sorry to all those we persecuted (I am thinking Galileo on this one)<br>

I totally agree it is ridiculous for anyone to tell you believing on faith is not as good as believing based on a bible (which they have faith is the word of a god). True, most A/As do look for scientific proof, or at least a sound logical theory, but biblican &quot;proof&quot; is not proof of anything anymore than &quot;Twas the Night Before Xmas&quot; is proof of Santa. This is the pot calling the kettle black. I have yet to come across anyone who can provide one iota of proof the bible is in any way divinely authored or even that half of it is true or accurate. Your faith is as good as theirs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bonbon2d>bonbon2D</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Apologist in Training</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/1/03 7:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.iambornagainru.org/bab/Avatars/cm09.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Fatih vs Proof....an observation</span><hr size=1> Interesting thread...just wanted to add that I was always &quot;taught&quot; the Bible to be true, and it was when I began these intriguing discussions with all of you ladies that I began to really search for the truth myself as well.

Your basically talking about the BOM because we &quot;bible only&quot; christians believe your wrong in trusting your heart about this book. so you think we need proof and dont have faith.  Your wrong there.  I have faith and it takes faith to believe.  I dont need proof.  The bible is my proof.<br>
I have  been told that if a testimony of the Book of Mormon is to be gained, the person must want it to be true. This strikes me as odd given the fact that my faith in the Bible did not come in such a manner. In fact, because of the strong message the Bible had for me as a lost sinner, I didn't want the Bible to be true.<br>
Of all people, the Christian should know that the heart of man is desperately wicked and cannot be trusted (Jeremiah 17:9). Because we are sinful creatures, we can be swayed by our emotions and sinful desires. To believe something is true merely because we feel it to be so is no guarantee of truth. Therefore, such a test would never be condoned by the Bible. Proverbs 14:12 tells us, &quot;There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.&quot; Clearly, God's Word demonstrates that feelings can be deceptive. Because of this, the sincere truth seeker must base his decisions using more objective means.   Does it not makes sense that if Satan wants people to believe the Book of Mormon is sacred scripture, he would incorporate an unbiblical method in order to come to such a conclusion? The Bible never says to pray about the matter. Instead, I John 4:1 reads, &quot;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.&quot; <br>
Some Mormon missionaries have erroneously told prospective converts that this means we should pray concerning the Book of Mormon. To assume such an interpretation is to ignore the Greek language used by the Apostle John. The word &quot;try&quot; in this verse is the word dok-im-ad-zo which means to examine, prove, or test. When it comes to making a decision of whether or not the Book of Mormon is from God, we are to test what it has to say. If it contradicts what God has already revealed, it fails. The real Holy Spirit will not contradict the Words of the True God. Unfortunately many sincere people fall for this ploy, not heeding the warning set forth by the Apostle John, and have, in essence, &quot;gained a testimony of the Book of Mormon&quot; in an unbiblical manner. It makes perfect sense that the father of lies would employ a false testing standard in order to seduce a person into believing a lie. <br>
Lets look at this from another angle. Would it be proper to pray whether or not it is ok to commit murder? adultery? theft? &quot;Of course not,&quot;. &quot;Why?&quot; you ask. &quot;Because the Bible already speaks out against such sins.&quot;  God has already given us His revealed will regarding such matters, and therefore no amount of prayer is going to change that fact. No matter how sincere a person may believe otherwise, anyone who claims God gave him permission to murder, steal, or commit adultery only proves to the one familiar with the Bible that this man did not hear from God. <br>
Why should it be any different when it comes to the Book of Mormon? What difference is it to pray concerning the Book of Mormon if the Bible has already spoken out against it? Do you think the all-knowing God of the Bible is so inept and forgetful that He would approve a book and religion which is opposed to what He has already revealed? Never! In violating the rules of sacred writ, The Book of Mormon, and Mormonism as a whole, meets the criteria of being 'another gospel.' No amount of semantics or prayer will change the matter.   <br>

<br>
Please not that this is a PARODY.  Hopefully it will be taken in good humor as well as illustrate the point of &quot;proving&quot; Christ and what is of Him.<br>
<br>
by John Tvedtnes <br>
<br>
John Tvetdnes, senior project manager for FARMS, has recently discovered a mid-first-century A.D. document,<br>
&quot;Solving The Christian Puzzle,&quot; written by Rabbi Yohanan bar Alcalai, and has taken the liberty of translating it from<br>
the original Hebrew. <br>
<br>
We are pleased to share with you this exiciting discovery: <br>
<br>
     You've probably had Christians come around to your door, wanting to engage you in &quot;discussions&quot; about<br>
     their faith. And maybe, as a good Jew, you've let them in the door. They seem to be nice young men,<br>
     well-dressed, well-mannered. They may even speak Hebrew or Aramaic, and they may carry the Bible<br>
     under their arms, but don't be deceived—they are not Jewish. Christianity is an insidious cult that seeks<br>
     to tear real adherents of Judaism away from Moses and the Bible. <br>
<br>
     Take, for example, their principal message, about the Messiah. They bring you their &quot;New Testament,<br>
     Another Witness of the Prophets&quot; and try to convince you that their founder, Jesus, was the Messiah. But<br>
     believe me, the Christians have a different messiah, not the Messiah of the Bible. While the biblical<br>
     Messiah is a king who will liberate us from our enemies, the Christian messiah is said to have died for our<br>
     sins, despite the fact that the Bible teaches that every man is responsible for his own sins (Leviticus<br>
     20:19-20). If a man commits murder, for example, he is to be executed for his sin, and there is no<br>
     provision for someone else dying in his stead (Genesis 9:6). The law of God clearly states that &quot;every man<br>
     shall be put to death for his own sin&quot; (Deuteronomy 24:16). For those not guilty of capital crimes, the<br>
     Bible is clear about the procedure that must be followed in order to be cleansed from sin. One must<br>
     confess his sins, make restitution for wrongs, and offer the proper sacrifice (Leviticus 4:2-4; Numbers<br>
     5:6-7). <br>
<br>
     The Christians believe that, because their leader died, it is no longer necessary to offer sacrifices at the<br>
     temple. But the Bible says otherwise, commanding, &quot;thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering<br>
     for atonement . . . two lambs of the first year day by day continually&quot; (Exodus 29:36, 3<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . These<br>
     sacrifices are to make &quot;throughout your generations&quot; (Exodus 30:10). <br>
<br>
     Ironically, the founder of the Christian Church was conceived out of wedlock, which, under the law of<br>
     Moses, disqualifies him from participating in religious functions (Deuteronomy 23:2). The Christians' own<br>
     scriptures acknowledge that Jesus was a winebibber (Matthew 11:19). The Bible warns us, saying, &quot;a<br>
     man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong<br>
     drink&quot; (Micah 2:11). The false prophet Jesus, who also claimed divine prerogatives, was tried and found<br>
     guilty of high crimes and executed by crucifixion. And yet some people are gullible enough to believe that<br>
     he was sent by God! <br>
<br>
     The Christians claim that their current leader, a sometime fisherman and money-digger (Matthew 17:27)<br>
     named Simon (who goes under the alias of Peter), along with their other apostles, are prophets who<br>
     speak with God. But their messages contradict the word of God as given through ancient prophets such<br>
     as Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. Prophecy ceased some four centuries ago with Malachi, whose record<br>
     marks the end of the scriptures God intended to give mankind. The Bible tells us to beware of false<br>
     prophets (Isaiah 9:15; Jeremiah 28:15), and the Lord warned us through Moses not to add or detract<br>
     from his word (Deuteronomy 4:2; 12:32). The Bible, from Genesis to Malachi, is inerrant and<br>
     all-sufficient, and it is blasphemous to suggest that God should give us additional scriptures, a &quot;new&quot;<br>
     testament that contradicts in every particular what he has already given us. <br>
<br>
     One of Simon Peter's supposed &quot;prophecies&quot; told him not to make a distinction between clean and<br>
     unclean animals (Acts 10:9-16), despite the fact that the Bible clearly commands that we make such a<br>
     distinction (Leviticus 10:10; 11:2-31, 41-47; 20:25; Deuteronomy 14:3-20). The &quot;revelation&quot; itself<br>
     contains a clue to its false nature. It says (verse 10) that Peter was suffering hunger when &quot;he fell into a<br>
     trance&quot; (Acts 10:10) His supposed &quot;vision&quot; (Acts 10:17)—or should we call it what it really is, an<br>
     hallucination—was from the feeling in his stomach, not from God. I had a dream very much like Peter's<br>
     one night, but instead of attributing it to a heavenly revelation, I chalked it up to a morsel of undigested<br>
     cheese. <br>
<br>
     The Christians also say that they have the priesthood, by which they claim to perform ordinances and<br>
     various miracles. The Bible makes it clear that the priesthood is restricted to the tribe of Levi, and that<br>
     God curses anyone else who tries to officiate in priesthood functions (2 Chronicles 26:18-19). When<br>
     Aaron and his sons were anointed, God said, &quot;for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting<br>
     priesthood throughout their generations&quot; (Exodus 40:15). God made a &quot;covenant of an everlasting<br>
     priesthood&quot; with Aaron's grandson Pinehas (Numbers 25:13), and his descendants still occupy the office<br>
     of high priest at the temple in Jerusalem. It is people like the Christians whom the Bible condemns<br>
     because they have &quot;cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made<br>
     you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself<br>
     with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods&quot; (2 Chronicles<br>
     13:9). <br>
<br>
     As for the supposed Christian &quot;miracles,&quot; it is clear that they do not follow the biblical pattern. Their<br>
     founder is said to have healed people by telling them their sins were forgiven (Matthew 9:2), while some<br>
     people were supposedly healed by touching his garment (Matthew 9:20-22; Mark 6:55-56). This<br>
     practice of magical rites is confirmed in another Christian scripture, Acts 19:12, which says people can be<br>
     healed by being touched with handkerchiefs or aprons touched by someone who has healing powers.<br>
     Even more fantastic is the story in Acts 5:15, where we read that people were healed when the shadow<br>
     of Peter fell on them! <br>
<br>
     The Christians also deny the efficacy of circumcision, wanting to replace it with baptism. But in the Bible<br>
     God clearly states that circumcision is &quot;a token of the covenant betwixt me and you,&quot; and is to be &quot;an<br>
     everlasting covenant.&quot; If a man is not circumcised, God says, &quot;that soul shall be cut off from his people; he<br>
     hath broken my covenant&quot; (Genesis 17:10-14). <br>
<br>
     In his &quot;sermon on the mount,&quot; the founder of the Christian Church openly spoke out against Bible<br>
     teachings that had been revealed from heaven. Even while professing that he had not &quot;come to destroy<br>
     the law, or the prophets&quot; (Matthew 5:17), he changed the sixth commandment from &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot; to<br>
     &quot;whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment&quot; (Matthew<br>
     5:21-22). He also reworded the seventh commandment, rejecting the words &quot;thou shalt not commit<br>
     adultery&quot; and substituting, &quot;whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with<br>
     her already in his heart&quot; (Matthew 5:27-2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . And though the Bible specifically says that we should<br>
     perform oaths in the name of the Lord (Deuteronomy 6:13; 10:20), Jesus abrogated the commandment<br>
     and taught &quot;swear not at all&quot; (Matthew 5:34). He also denounced the biblical law of divorce (Matthew<br>
     5:31-32). In the same sermon, he showed his utter depravity and demented state by telling his disciples to<br>
     pluck out their right eyes and to cut off their right hands (Matthew 5:29- 30). It is hard to believe that<br>
     anyone could accept someone like this as the Messiah. <br>
<br>
     Finally, Christians revere their leader as a martyr, one who &quot;gave his life&quot; willingly. Yet the facts tell a<br>
     different story: When the chief priests came to lawfully arrest this Jesus, his principal disciple (and current<br>
     leader of the Christians) lashed out with a sword, inflicting serious head wounds upon the high priest's<br>
     servant (John 18:3-10)! Jesus, the &quot;martyr,&quot; was involved in a sword fight shortly before his death! <br>
<br>
     Now, you might want to try helping your Christian neighbor find his way to the God of the Bible. But<br>
     bear in mind that it will be difficult to talk to him because Christians have their own unique definition of<br>
     biblical terms. So when they use the term &quot;messiah,&quot; they're not thinking of the biblical Messiah, but of the<br>
     criminal Jesus. When they speak of &quot;sacrifice,&quot; they don't mean the sacred rites of the temple of God, but<br>
     refer to the execution of the criminal Jesus. A true Jew understands salvation to be God's intervention in<br>
     the affairs of men to save his people, Israel, from their enemies. But Christians use the term &quot;salvation&quot; to<br>
     mean resurrection and going to heaven to live with God. And this comes only if you believe in their other<br>
     messiah! <br>
<br>
     We love the Christian people and need to do everything in our power to bring them back to the God of<br>
     the Bible. You should, of course, pray for your Christian friends. But you can do more. The ministry we<br>
     have organized here at Yeshivah Ahuvat ha-Shem needs your help in order to continue its work in<br>
     exposing the insidious Christian conspiracy against the Jewish people. Please send your love offerings by<br>
     courier to us at Yavneh-Yam. Thank you and God bless you for your faithfulness and generosity.<br>

I dont need proof. The bible is my proof.” Are a good demonstration of what Misty was talking about. You are using a circular argument here that your proof that what your bible says is true is the bible itself and you have faith that it is true because it says it is or perhaps you feel Yahweh speaks to you or moves your soul—which seems to me very similar to the sort of faith she has. It is the same really. <br>
I think more to the point is that if a person has faith in the OT and NT, then as you point out one must accept there are no additional gospels, but then we heathens are fairly skeptical about the entire composition, compilation and translation of the bible anyway (esp. KJV—wow).<br>
 <br>
I do have a few points/questions for you all though since they were brought up here—<br>
<br>
“Clearly, God's Word demonstrates that feelings can be deceptive. Because of this, the sincere truth seeker must base his decisions using more objective means.”<br>
Many, many non-LDS xians tell me the “feel” the holy spirit or god or Jesus. Should they distrust this? Should they distrust feelings in general? By what objective means would a person investigate the validity of a “feeling” of faith or about a deity or book.<br>
<br>
“Does it not makes sense that if Satan wants people to believe the Book of Mormon is sacred scripture, he would incorporate an unbiblical method in order to come to such a conclusion?”<br>
This is an interesting question, but I would say if Joseph Smith and the BOM was the best Satan can come up with I’m pretty disappointed in the Prince of Darkness. I know this will be offensive to LDS, but I am hardpressed to think of a founder of any sect or religion more obviously fake and so easily disproven…and the whole turning Native Americans skin dark and blacks can’t be priests thing…hello!! Anyway-just a thought. Do you really think Satan is that lame? I mean, sure he’s evil, but is he stupid and lacking in creativity and biblical scholarship to this degree? I wouldn’t have thought so, but I don’t have faith in Satan either<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

“To assume such an interpretation is to ignore the Greek language used by the Apostle John. The word &quot;try&quot; in this verse is the word dok-im-ad-zo which means to examine, prove, or test. When it comes to making a decision of whether or not the Book of Mormon is from God, we are to test what it has to say. If it contradicts what God has already revealed, it fails.”<br>
And yet the OT and NT are full of self contradictions, so to me this seems like the pot calling the kettle black again. Besides the misquoting of Greek is very common and is the reason so many xians misinterpret the Easter story in which the word for “awaken” is used rather than resurrected and is not being corrected by modern xians though it is clearly a mistranslation, but that’s a whole other story. My point is poor translation and contradictions are rife throughout your bible too. How can you tell they are not of Satan also? Do you feel it? There cannot be proof and many authors of biblical sections are anonymous. How do you know they are not false? Faith? Seems very much like what Misty talks about here again. There is no proof of the authorship of the gospels…do you “feel” they are of Yahweh?<br>

“No matter how sincere a person may believe otherwise, anyone who claims God gave him permission to murder, steal, or commit adultery only proves to the one familiar with the Bible that this man did not hear from God.”<br>
Wow—I can't believe you said this! Your god hasn't just given permission to rape, kill, enslave, steal, plunder and pillage (women and children included)-he has commanded it. We are talking about the Xian bible right?<br>
Deuteronomy 2: 33-35 RSV<br>
33 And the LORD our God gave him over to us; and we defeated him and his sons and all his people.34 And we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed every city, men, women, and children; we left none remaining;35 only the cattle we took as spoil for ourselves, with the booty of the cities which we captured.<br>
Deuteronomy 20: 10-17<br>
10 &quot;When you draw near to a city to fight against it, offer terms of peace to it.11 And if its answer to you is peace and it opens to you, then all the people who are found in it shall do forced labor for you and shall serve you.12 But if it makes no peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it;13 and when the LORD your God gives it into your hand you shall put all its males to the sword,14 but the women and the little ones, the cattle, and everything else in the city, all its spoil, you shall take as booty for yourselves; and you shall enjoy the spoil of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you.15 Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far from you, which are not cities of the nations here.16 But in the cities of these peoples that the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes,17 but you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the LORD your God has commanded;<br>
Numbers 31: 1-18<br>
1 The LORD said to Moses,2 &quot;Avenge the people of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your people.&quot;3 And Moses said to the people, &quot;Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute the LORD's vengeance on Midian.<br>
4 You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war.&quot;5 So there were provided, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand from each tribe, together with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.<br>
7  They warred against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and slew every male.8 They slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian; and they also slew Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.9 And the people of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and they took as booty all their cattle, their flocks, and all their goods.10 All their cities in the places where they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burned with fire,11 and took all the spoil and all the booty, both of man and of beast.12 Then they brought the captives and the booty and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the people of Israel, at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.13 Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation, went forth to meet them outside the camp.14 And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had come from service in the war.15 Moses said to them, &quot;Have you let all the women live?16 Behold, these caused the people of Israel, by the counsel of Balaam, to act treacherously against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and so the plague came among the congregation of the LORD.17 Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.18 But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.<br>
1st Samuel 15: 2,3 RSV<br>
2 Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I will punish what Amalek did to Israel in opposing them on the way, when they came up out of Egypt.3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.'&quot;<br>
Genesis 22: 1-12 RSV<br>
1 After these things God tested Abraham, and said to him, &quot;Abraham!&quot; And he said, &quot;Here am I.&quot;2 He said, &quot;Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.&quot;9 When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.10 Then Abraham put forth his hand, and took the took the knife to slay his son <br>
Psalm 137: 7-9 RSV<br>
7 Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, how they said, &quot;Raze it, raze it! Down to its foundations!&quot;8 O daughter of Babylon, you devastator! Happy shall he be who requites you with what you have done to us!9 Happy shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock!<br>
Joshua 8: 1-29 RSV<br>
1 And the LORD said to Joshua, &quot;Do not fear or be dismayed; take all the fighting men with you, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, his city, and his land;2 and you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king; only its spoil and its cattle you shall take as booty for yourselves; lay an ambush against the city, behind it.&quot;<br>
3 So Joshua arose, and all the fighting men, to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.4 And he commanded them, &quot;Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it; do not go very far from the city, but hold yourselves all in readiness;5 and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach the city. And when they come out against us, as before, we shall flee before them;6 and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, 'They are fleeing from us, as before.' So we will flee from them;7 then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize the city; for the LORD your God will give it into your hand.And if you are worried about false prophets and holy texts and other evils, shouldn’t you be looking the real party who has openly claimed responsibility in the place you look for proof-the bible, “I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil I the LORD do all these things.”<br>
<br>
I agree the Mormon Yahweh is no peace lover, but is he worse than this? Do you think LDS makes your version of your god more nasty? I’m hard pressed to accept that given the “biblical proof” of his actions (and I’m not even including the murders he committed himself).<br>
<br>
Heather-You say “No amount of semantics or prayer will change the matter.” And I could not agree with that statement more, though I dare say for very different reasons. Again, I agree with you about the BOM and I understand your objection to it being added, but you are not coming from a position of objective or scientific anything, faith is faith and the more I hear xians talk to each other, the more arbitrarily I see it is applied.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You say, &quot;The Bible never says to pray about the matter.  Instead I John 4:1 reads, &quot;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.&quot;&quot;  How are they (we) supposed to  &quot;try&quot;, &quot;prove&quot;, or &quot;test&quot; if prayer is not included?<br>
<br>
James 1:5-6 says, &quot;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.  6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.  For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.&quot;  Joseph Smith used this very method to get the answers he was given!  You said, &quot;When it comes to making a decision of whether or not the Book of Mormon is from God, we are to test what it has to say.  If it contradicts what God has already revealed, if fails.  The real Holy Spirit will not contradict the Words of the True God.  Unfortunately many sincere people fall for this ploy...&quot;  How does the Book of Mormon contradict the Bible?  IMO it adds upon it, not contradicts it.  <br>
<br>
You also say, that those of the LDS faith have &quot;gained a testimony of the Book of Mormon in an unbiblical manner.&quot;  I ask, how is it unbiblical to pray??????<br>
<br>
Again, here is a quote from you, &quot;Why should it be any different when it comes to the Book of Mormon?  What difference is it to pray concerning the Book of Mormon if the Bible has already spoken out against it?&quot;  In Ezekiel 37:16-17 it states, &quot;Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Isreal his companions:  then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Isreal his companions:  17 And join them one to another into one stick; and they should become one in thine hands.&quot;  We have the Bible, which is the stick of Judah.  But, where exactly is the stick of Ephraim?  <br>
<br>
I totally belive that EVERYONE has the right to believe what they want to.

One of the books, they insist, is the Bible, while the other is the Book of Mormon. One Mormon leader who championed this notion was LDS Apostle LeGrand Richards. On page 67 of his book A Marvelous Work and A Wonder, he quotes Ezekiel 37:15-20 and concludes, &quot;In ancient times it was the custom to write on parchment and roll it on a stick. Therfore, when this command was given, it was the equivalent of directing that two books or records should be kept.&quot; Is such a conclusion plausible? Was Ezekiel speaking of two records that were to be kept? <br>
<br>
First of all we must examine the Hebrew word used in the above passages. In doing so we find that the word used, &quot;aits,&quot; speaks of a literal piece of wood, not books or scrolls as Mormons often insist. Consider 1 Kings 17:12. This passage reads: <br>
<br>
&quot;So he [Elijah] arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold the widow woman was there gathering sticks.&quot; <br>
<br>
Elijah asks her for some water and a morsel of bread, to which the woman responds by telling the prophet: <br>
<br>
&quot;I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruise [pitcher]: and, behold I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress [prepare] it for me and my son, that we may eat it and die.&quot; <br>
<br>
Was the widow of Zarapath gathering books? If your answer is no, then there is no consistency in claiming the sticks of Ezekiel 37 are books since both passages use the same word. <br>
<br>
Another set of passages to consider is 2 Kings 6:1-7. The Bible tells how, during the act of cutting down a tree, the axe head fell off its handle and landed in the water. Distressed because the axe was borrowed, the man who was using the axe sought the aid of Elisha the prophet. Pointing out where the axe head landed, Elisha proceeds to &quot;cut down a stick&quot; and cast it into the water. Amazingly the iron axe head floats to the top. Now I don't believe I've ever heard a Mormon insist that Elisha cut down a book and threw it into the water. But again, if the Mormon wishes to insist that Ezekiel 37 speaks of books, and wants to be consistent at the same time, he must conclude Elisha cut a book off the tree since the word stick in verse 6 is the same Hebrew word that is Ezekiel 37:16ff. <br>
<br>
Of course, the widow of Zarephath was not gathering books, any more than Elisha cut down a book from a tree. Neither was Ezekiel holding books (or scrolls) in his hand as Mormons all too often imply. Ezekiel 37 has nothing to say about the Book of Mormon. By using two literal sticks, Ezekiel was illustratively predicting the coming together of two nations, Judah and Israel, which had been separated since the time of King Rehoboam, nothing more. If the Mormon would continue reading to verse 22, he would see that this is clearly explained.    <br>

<br>
Rather than engage in what will surely become an endless &quot;but the Bible says this here&quot; back and forth I have two questions for you.<br>
<br>
1) How is this type of argument against the LDS church and &quot;Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ&quot; any different that the way the Pharisees argued that Jesus was not the Messiah?  (See above spoof if you haven't already read it)<br>
<br>
2) How do you think the People who did recognize Jesus as the Christ when he lived among us recognized him?<br>
<br>
I personally do not think I can &quot;prove&quot; the LDS Church and Book of Mormon are true through debate, but I think it has been amply shown that the arguments you are using do not prove them to be false either.<br>
<br>
I have to admit that one of the things that surprised me most when I first entered in to these types of discussions with Christian people other than LDS was that there were so many who were saying that to pray for answer about something was wrong!  Also, I think it would be great if a person who was about to commit adultery asked God what he thought about it first and then listened to the answer, don't you ;-)<br>

<br>
I read through your other scriptures concerning sticks, and see where you may be coming from.  In Ezekiel, it specifically says &quot;...take thee one stick, and write upon it...&quot; and &quot;then take thee another stick, and write upon it...&quot;.  Ezekiel said that they were to write upon these sticks, not that the two sticks were to unite as one.  I am not disputing that Israel shall be gathered.... but I still say that it clearly states that these sticks were to be written upon.<br>
<br>
Also still curios how it is &quot;unbiblical to pray&quot;<br>
<br>
And Whanda is right... it is pretty fruitless to go Bible verses back and forth.  Just hoping for you to see that even though you are fully committed to your faith that that does not make everyone else evil followers of Satan <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , or even really as misguided as you are saying.   <br>

 Yes I would want them to go off of facts and not feelings.  I believe the bible is truth.  There are things in the bible that I dont like but just because I feel that way doesn't change the fact of what God said.  I believe there is proof that God is real.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Heidi (I think), about praying?  I never said it is wrong to pray.  I'm saying you dont pray about things that are already written out for us in scripture.     I've done alot of studying on the Mormans beliefs and when lined up with the bible it doesnt hold true therefore its out!  I check it with the bible not my feelings.   Does that make sense? <br>
<br>
I know there where a lot more other questions out there for me but I dont have time to answer all of them.

Heather, your post is word for word taken from Bill McKeen (I admit, before I ran the search I was expecting Matt Slick so I proved myself wrong there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Ironically, one of the the things he also says is: &quot;is it not possible that this Mormon's decision could have been based in wanting to be accepted by his peers rather<br>
                        than a genuine experience with the Holy Ghost? On a broader scope, could it be that many people embrace the Book<br>
                        of Mormon because those they love and trust also believe it? If not, what evidence is used to come to such a<br>
                        conclusion other than pure subjective feelings?&quot;<br>
<br>
My answer to his question is, YES, that is entirely possible.  It is entirely possible to believe the right thing but for the wrong reason, I see it all the time and have been guilty of it myself.  It is also entirely possible (in fact probable) that you could fit the words &quot;fundamentalist Christians&quot; in where he says &quot;mormon&quot; and it would be just as true.  It's also possible to believe the wrong things for the right reasons or wrong reasons or vice versa, etc, etc, etc.  Again, I'm not trying to &quot;prove&quot; the Book of Mormon is true, I'm just illustrating once again that these arguments do not prove it is false, even by Biblical standards.<br>
<br>
I would ask this question (which I don't expect anyone to publicy answer, but at least give it some thought), did the Bible *really* cause you to feel the way you do about praying about the Book of Mormon or did someone like Mr. McKeen lead you to believe that is what the Bible said?  Was the Bible your motivation or was that essay your excuse.  (motivation is what drives something int he first place, excuse is what is looked to to justify after the fact)<br>

Sorry, I didn't finish all I wanted to say there, I had a baby due for a nursing and nap <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START |I --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tired.gif ALT="|I"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I wanted to say that I hope I did not put you on the spot there, that is not my intention, I know that sometimes it is hard to put things into words and might be easier to just grab something that someone with similar beliefs has already said. (but maybe giving them credit if we've quoted them word for word would be a good idea, no! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
My point is that unless you believe Bill McKeen is a prophet, then his or your ideas of what the Bible means is just as good as the next persons.<br>
<br>
The Bible does not spell out &quot;Do not pray about the Book of Mormon.&quot;  It has not been &quot;proven&quot; by Biblical standards that the BoM is not true.  Do you see what I'm saying?<br>

I get my bible out and study it for myself.  <br>
I know you think that link is all Anti-Morman but it all lines up with what my morman friend tells me.  If I have a question about something I ask her, Is this what you believe?&quot; and she will tell me.  It lines up all the way.   You just see it as anti morman because its going against what you believe, but its proving it with the word of God.  Not his own thoughts.  Its a very good website I must say!<br>
