Also, it appears to me (and I could be wrong) that one of the big complaints that non-Christians have with Christians is the concept of who God is (i.e. the sending people straight to Hell if they don't believe).<br>
<br>
So, I thought I would mention what my understanding of the nature of God is. We, as LDS, believe that God is similar to any loving father, except that He has been perfected. We believe that He loves us. As a mother, I look at my children and I know how much I love them and I believe that God, as my Father in Heaven, loves me and my children with a perfect love, which exceeds the love I am capable of feeling. I believe that He sees our struggles and He is saddened by our pain and that he sees our joy and rejoices with us. (A little digression, we have struggles and bad things happen, according to my belief, because God does not take away the agency of other people. If someone wants to rob my house, just because I am a good person, God will not take away the choices of the robber. However, there will be consequences for all our choices, whether good consequences or bad consequences). Anyway, we, as members of the LDS church also do not believe that God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are one being, all the same, big, small, can fit in your hand or fill the entire universe.... I have yet to meet someone who can really explain that to me that believes in the Trinity. We believe that God is the Father, that Jesus Christ is God's Son, literally, and that the Holy Spirit is separate but equally important. We believe that Christ is our elder brother, that we are his brothers and sisters (all children of God) and that when the Bible (OT) discusses sacrifices of the firstborn, well, there must be second born, thirdborn, etc. in spirit as well. <br>
<br>
Back to the nature of God... we do not believe that if you say the prayer, something like I accept Christ as my personal savior, yadda yadda... that we are instantly saved at that moment. We also don't believe that everyone who doesn't utter those words is going straight to Hell to burn for eternity. We believe that the concept of Heaven and Hell is merely one step in eternal progression. Those who have lived a good life, according to their knowledge, will first go to what we believe Christ was talking about on the cross... Paradise, a place where basically good spirits and those who have received and believed in the gospel of Jesus Christ will be (of course this is assuming that believing in Christ will make your works in accordance... we believe you are judged on your knowledge of right and wrong... It would be like giving a science major and an english major a test on quantum physics. You can't judge them equally when one has much more knowledge on the subject... does that make sense?) Those who did not know of Christ or accept him or who did know of him and who were not good people, did not live according to their knowledge of right and wrong, will go to a place called Spirit Prison, which can be equated with what most Christians call Hell. However, it is not fire and brimstone, burn you at the stake. It is a place of ignorance or lack of knowledge where we believe that everyone will have the opportunity to learn about Christ and His teachings and either accept what we believe was a gift, His atonement for sin, or reject it. After a period of time, those in both realms of the Spirit world will be judged. We believe that those who have a knowledge of Christs gospel will be judged more harshly than those who did not. We believe that at that point, unless you have had your faith turned to knowledge (which we believe Joseph Smith did when God and Christ appeared to him) and then denied that you *knew* Him (which Joseph Smith didn't - just to clarify), you will inherit a Kingdom of Glory. Therefore, according to our religion, anyone who has always been an athiest or who has never really had a testimony/belief that Jesus was truly the Christ would never end up in Hell (what we call Outer Darkness) which is where Satan dwells where there is no light and no glory. Everyone, except those who have had faith turned to knowledge and denied it, will inherit some glory. We believe then that there are 3 Kingdoms of Glory (like Heaven, where God dwells). There is the third which has the least glory (like the stars) for people who were basically not real great people... we believe that God loves them even if they commited crimes, etc but that they will not be rewarded with the same glory as those who lived a good life. Then there is the second (like the moon in brightness)  and the first (like the brightness of the sun) for the people who lived the best lives or who, according to their knowledge, lived their lives with integrity. Of course, we believe that God knows the hearts of all of us and that we will be judged fairly. I would assume that this means that a person who did not believe in God, but who believed it was good to do service and did service, who was charitable and kind, in spite of the fact that they may have persecuted for not believing in God, that they could inherit the highest kingdom and receive the highest glory, if they accepted the gift Christ gave in the spirit world. We also believe that every person will have a good chance to accept Christ, not the born again version of accept and be saved, but get to know him and know of his love. Some may never really get that chance until their time in the spirit world but they still get the chance. <br>
<br>
I know that for a/a's, it doesn't really matter but I wanted you to know, especially, that we do not see God as a stern, condemning being, but as a loving father who wants the best for us just as a mortal father would for his children. We see him as gentle and loving, yet bound by law, which is why he sent Jesus Christ to atone for our sins. He knew none of us would be perfect and He wanted us back with him. So, He found a way to satisfy the law (Christ paid the price for our shortcomings) and cut us a little slack... so we didn't have to be perfect to return home to Him. The irony in all this is that mainstream Christians say we aren't Christian because we don't believe in the harsh accept or burn philosophy and yet to me, the way we believe is much more in accordance to Christ's teachings of love and tolerance and they way you would expect someone who bears His name to behave. Or course, that is my opinion.<br>

<br>
To me, this is simply further proof that man created god in his own image. For example, vengeful people believe in a vengeful god. People who hate homosexuals believe in a god that hates homosexual behavior, and so on. People look to religion to confirm the feelings and prejudices they already have. This has to be, because how could god's nature be knowable, and how can people presume to know what that nature is?<br>
<br>
Yes ST I agree that salvation theory makes no sense. Why would god create a method of salvation that was so convoluted and so incredibly difficult to believe in, but if we don't believe it we go to hell? Much more likely that Jesus's death on the cross was just how he happened to die, and his followers imbued it with &quot;meaning&quot; and added it to the dogma.<br>

Here goes </span><hr size=1> (...wondering what I got myself into)<br>
<br>
Well, I do believe that God created the law, basically that no unclean thing (or anyone who has sinned) could dwell in the presence of God, because He has *become* perfect (again, something that most Christians don't believe..). I believe that before we came to earth, there was a counsel/meeting in Heaven where God, our father, presented us with His plan, the law, ect.  much like a parent might meet with their children to discuss situations. In order for God's plan to work, someone had to be willing to sacrifice in order to satisfy the law. Two plans were presented. Lucifer (Satan) basically said send me and I will make sure that everyone returns no matter what... he wanted to take away our choices and take all the glory for his own. Christ said, no, send me. I will sacrifice myself to atone for their sins. Through Christ's sacrifice, we are all given our agency, the right to make our own decisions, to make mistakes, to learn right from wrong. Along with that comes the requirement that we repent when we do something that we know is wrong.  And Christ said that the glory would be God's. Which is basically why we thank God when we are blessed, we pray to him for guidance, and we love him. With Satan's plan, we would have no choice but to worship Satan. God wanted us to have the choice to believe or not believe, to worship or not to worship, to be good or to be evil. Through our choices we learn wisdom. God, as our father, wants us to learn and to grow personally, emotionally, spiritually. Satan's plan would not allow for that. But Christ's plan would. It gave us freedom. But freedom comes with responsibility (I'm sure I will be saying that to my kids when they are teens and want to take the car...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) The responsibility is that we are sorry when we do something wrong and that we try to improve ourselves. The reason God created a plan which required that there be a sacrifice was to teach us as well. In order for the sacrifice to work (to satisfy the law) Christ had to be perfect, which we believe He was. Through his life, his example, and his teachings, we learn how to pattern our lives, and we want to be like him because he was perfect and loved us enough to suffer and give his life for us, so that we could be imperfect (as we would be) and still be able to return to live with God.<br>
<br>
I believe that if the nature of God is that of a loving father, then his wife would be that of a loving mother. Whether or not God has more than one wife... I don't know that. Most religions don't believe that God has a wife or that we have a Mother in Heaven but if we are God's children and we believe that God is our father, it seems that ther should also be a mother. It goes along with our belief that families are eternal, that we remain a family after we die. That means that me and my dh will always be husband and wife and that eventually, we will have the chance to also create as God has.  <br>
<br>
As to why do I believe that this is the nature of God? Because I can't conceive of a God who is ruthless and mean, who would willing condemn many of His children to eternal damnation because they either had no chance to learn of Him (which was the case in many communist countries) or because they were presented with and believed something else. I can't conceive of a God who would only give one chance and if you miss it you are basically damned. I cannot conceive of a God who doesn't love me, as His child, at least equally as much as I love my own children. If my child makes a mistake, gets mad at me, etc, would I write either of them off and be done with them? Never in a million years. I would and will give my children every possible chance. I will forgive every time my daughter tells me she doesn't like me anymore. I will love my children in spite of choices they might make which are maybe not the best for them. That is how a parent is with a child. Loving, kind, forgiving, compassionate, and willing to do whatever possible to make sure that they are happy. And I believe that God is my father... not just some intangible, can't really describe him, being. I believe that He has a body (resurrected and perfect) and that we are created with bodies like his. Why else would the Bible say that we are created in His image if He was like many religions believe. We believe that if we were to see God, he would look like us, with arms, legs, eyes, a nose, ears, mouth, you get the picture. And I believed that when he looks at us, He looks at us with a love that runs as deep as my love for my child. That is why I believe that to be the nature of my God. I can't imagine Him being any other way. <br>
<br>
I realize that the burden of proof is with those of us who believe but I am not sure how you would ever prove something that is eternal with what I believe is the limited knowledge of man. If I had to have PROOF that there was a God, I would never believe in him. I don't have proof. No one does as far as empirical proof is concerned. But to me personally, I have the moments when I feel that something beyond me is helping me, or when I have the thought pop into my head to do something and had I not done it, I would have been harmed. I have feelings in me that for me, give me the faith that there is knowledge and reason beyond what man is capable of completely understanding but it doesn't mean it isn't there. I am not saying that it is the same for anyone else... but for me, that is how it is. And there is no proof of these things. If God had sent Satan, there would be proof and we would all have our choices taken away from us. Instead, we have our choices but we also have to go on faith, not proof. <br>
<br>
Also, science has often proved itself wrong. In order for science to improve and progress, it has to prove itself wrong and replace old theories with new knowlege. Beliefs about the universe have changed a lot from the world being flat, the sun revolving around the earth, etc. We are making advancements in science all the time. But science is still based on the knowledge of man.  It isn't possible to prove the things of God with the imperfect knowledge of Man. God gives us knowledge (I believe) a little at a time, not all at once, which is why there will always be questions in all realms that have yet to be answered. At least in my opinion.<br>

<br>
Yet another difference between LDS and mainstream Christianity is that we don't see that the cross is what it was ALL about. What is really more important is what occurred before that. When Christ was in the Garden of Gethsemane and prayed to God, his Father, and there he suffered, cried, bled for our sins. He suffered what we would have suffered if he hadn't done it. He had to die and be resurrected so that we could all be resurrected. It didn't matter how he died, the only stipulation is that he had to consent to death. They didn't kill him on the cross. He commanded his spirit into God's hands and then he died.  But I just wanted to point out the difference... that we don't see the cross as &quot;what Jesus did&quot;. Rather, we see the atonement that took place in the Garden of Gethsemane as his offering to us. By the time they raised him up on that cross, he had already atoned for our sins. That is why Mormons do not wear the cross or display crosses on their buildings, temples, etc. The cross is not an icon or symbol of the Mormon church. It is a symbol of Christ's death. We don't celebrate Christ's death. We celebrate His life and his eternal life and what he did for us.  <br>

<br>
For what reason, upon what basis, why do you believe any of this?  By what merit does this belief, or any of the xian ones, deserve the time and energy that is spent defending them?  In what way is this <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>True</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?  Unless you can demonstrate it as valid, then it is no more deserving of belief than the idea that the world rests on the back of a turtle, or satan is god, or that if we don't sacrifice this chicken here the world will end tomorrow.  The unexamined life is not worth living (Socrates).  You might have a right to your belief, you might have a right to speak about it publicly, you are free to practice your religion, but that does NOT make it equally valid when tested against reality.  Believe all day you can levitate, then step off my porch roof and prove it.  Believe that the shaman's mystic talisman protects you from bullets, then shoot one at yourself.  Believe that harassing and condemning people to eternal damnation for not muttering the same mantra you do gets you into heaven, and show me how you know it.  Extrodinary claims call for equally extrordinary evidence.  <br>
<br>
I cannot speak for atheists, for they are not organized and only share the one common trait, lack of a belief in god.  However, I can speak for skeptics because they have very clear rules and structure.  This appears to be the pinion of DAG's problems in the arguments here.  That being that a skeptic accepts only what is proven.  (This is different from a sucker who accepts anything they are told or a synic who accepts nothing.)  It is the idea that we need to keep an open mind, but not so open our brains fall out (Sagan).  DAG is arguing for a disproof of something, but a skeptic does not start with a collection of beliefs and then demands the world prove them wrong. A skeptic starts from nothing and only adds those beliefs to their worldview as they are proven.  Logic has clear rules and gets equally applied to everything.<br>
<br>
I recommend going to the Skeptic Society website <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.skeptic.com/">www.skeptic.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and ordering their Baloney Detection Kit.  It costs about $5 and contains a detailed explanation of most of the logical fallacies people encounter (Arguments from Authority, False dichotomy, etc.)  This is a secular work and makes no mentions of gods or belief structures, only the critical thinking tools needed to examine and evaluate merits of reasoned argumentation.  It runs about 12 pages long.  It does not delve into the whole mathematics of logic (All A is B, Some C is D. etc)  but it would certainly help people when they are about to stick their own feet in their mouth.<br>

<br>
First of all, I am not trying to convince you that it is true. It is neither here nor there to me if you believe it or not. I was merely pointing out that not all Christian religions believe that you, as a person not believing in God because you have no reasonable PROOF, will go straight to Hell because you don't accept Christ as your savior. <br>
<br>
I have seen a lot on these boards about &quot;why would I believe in a God like that?&quot; and I just wanted to point out that I wouldn't believe in a God like that either. <br>
<br>
This is the only reason I would think it would be good if the LDS were not included in the Christian category... because many Christians out there are pushy, arrogant, and believe things that are much more dismal imo. However, we insist that we are Christian because we believe in Christ's Divinity. <br>
<br>
I will never prove it to you or anyone else. I think I already made that point clear. Nor will I try because the attempt would be futile. There is no absolute proof otherwise religion would not be religion, it would be science, based on fact. Because it is not, because it is based on faith, it can't live up to the scrutiny of science. It is not scientific. <br>
<br>
The reason that religion merits the time and energy that is spent defending them is because it is something that has value to those who defend it. The why isn't ever going to be the same for everyone. You know, a century ago, even decades ago, you could not PROVE who the father of a baby was. Before DNA, we couldn't prove that someone actually commited a crime unless they were caught doing it. You could only provide evidence that made your doubts less than your belief that it was true. Yet it doesn't mean that there really wasn't a father to a particular baby or that someone didn't actually commit the crime. But, advances in Science has made it so that we can show, not 100%,  but close enough to be taken as truth who the father is, who was at the scene of a crime, etc. Before DNA, there was only blood tests which were extremely less reliable than DNA.  Therefore, not all things have always been able to be proved which are true and yet it didn't make them any less true. Just because I can't prove to you that my beliefs are valid or true, doesn't necissarily make them false. They just don't stand up to YOUR guidelines as to what is believable and what isn't.  I am not saying that you shouldn't be skeptical. I am not trying to change your mind but to say that because something can't be proven, or doesn't stand up to your standards of logic, then it must be untrue, is arrogant.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Double Latte</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(1/5/03 1:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  free will</span><hr size=1> &quot;Through Christ's sacrifice, we are all given our agency, the right to make our own decisions, to make mistakes, to learn right from wrong.&quot;<br>

<br>
”Because I can't conceive of a God who is ruthless and mean, who would willing condemn many of His children to eternal damnation because they either had no chance to learn of Him (which was the case in many communist countries) or because they were presented with and believed something else. I can't conceive of a God who would only give one chance and if you miss it you are basically damned. I cannot conceive of a God…That is why I believe that to be the nature of my God. I can't imagine Him being any other way.”<br>
I can conceive of such a god, but I would agree with you this kind of narcissistic, sadistic jerk of a deity wouldn’t be worth worshipping…..now being coerced into obeying him I could see, but we can discuss Baptists and Lutherans another time..hehe-sorry couldn’t resist. I understand totally what you are saying, but it doesn’t stand the test of reason. To say you think the nature of a thing is one way simply because you cannot conceive of or don’t like any other way is not logical nor good enough reason to build a belief system on. <br>
<br>
”I realize that the burden of proof is with those of us who believe but I am not sure how you would ever prove something that is eternal with what I believe is the limited knowledge of man. If I had to have PROOF that there was a God, I would never believe in him. I don't have proof. No one does as far as empirical proof is concerned.”<br>
Oh thank you, thank you, thank you. Can you please communicate this to dag. We could argue endlessly about whether having faith is worthwhile, but finally a theist who acknowledges that you cannot prove a negative!!!  On a debate board you won't get far claiming faith and &quot;feeling&quot; to make a point, but at least we have agreement that this is what belief in the supernatural is based on and that there is no proof (that anyone can present).

I've never understood this.  Why did Christ's death bring about salvation for all humans?  There is no logical correlation between the two events. . . point B does not follow logically from point A.  And, while I know we are dealing with faith which, ovbviously, is not bound by rules of logic, I wonder how people accept this as plausible.<br>
<br>
I mean, if Christ had said, &quot;Send me, there's a big huge boulder blocking the gates of heaven and I'm the strongest person in the universe.   I'll move it.&quot;  That, at least, would logically precede the concept of humans being able to ascend the kingdom of God.  <br>
<br>
Why would his carefully planned death &quot;allow&quot; your god to forgive us our sins?  And why, if heaven is such a swell place, is it even considered a sacrifice?<br>

Correct.  Science is the study of reality to develop valid systems of predicting results and understanding our universe.  Religion is not based on reality.  It is all bunk.<br>
<br>
You may not care to try and convinvce us, but this is a debate board so expect opposing opinions expressed.  Fortunately, as an atheist I do not believe in hell either.  So I am safe from that stress.  However, you are just like those other religions, pushey or not in that you believe in something without proof.  You may be more polite (much more in fact) but it still all rests on a core falsehood.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The reason that religion merits the time and energy that is spent defending them is because it is something that has value to those who defend it.

Again, I disagree.  The reason they get the time and energy defnding them is because people <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>THINK</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it has value.  This is why it IS the same for everyone who uses logic and reason.  I would go so far as to say that it very clearly has a NEGATIVE value.  It does far more harm than good.  Because of religion you have countless murders, wars and oppressions.  Racism, hatered and tribalism.  All products of various gods.  People are riddled with guilt as to their worth, or fear as to their salvation.  It reduces freedom.  It controls populations.  Defending pedophiles, eroding culture, crushing diversity, reducing taxable land and forcing the citizens to shoulder the financial burdens of god's greed.  It encourages all these horrible things.  I will go so far as to bet that all these negatives far outweigh the small comfort you get in thinking (and wrongly so) that you not only have an immortal soul, but that it is going someplace better.  The better place could be right here if we got rid of the limiting shackles of god.<br>
<br>
Now before you run off and tell me your religion does some good like providing water or feeding homeless, all of those things could be just as easily done secularly.  So there is no inherent benefit to it being done by your church that a secular system doesn't also provide.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I am not trying to change your mind but to say that because something can't be proven, or doesn't stand up to your standards of logic, then it must be untrue, is arrogant.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
There is a difference between the justifiable confidence that springs from security in a position and the arrogance of believeing you cannot be challenged.  I do not presume that I cannot be disproven.  I would dearly love to think I can see my mom again, that the girl who killed herself in high school will tell me why she did it, that my dad will have his leg again and get to chase me as we did when I was a kid, that my time with my wife will never end, that I can watch my kids, grandkids, greatgrandkids all grow up and have families.  I would love all of that.  I long to be proven wrong.  Show me the path and I will walk it as an apostle.  By what standard can we tell if not reason?  Faith?  How then to distinguish between competing beliefs?  You say they are all valid, they say only theirs is, who is correct?  I have only the tools of testing reality that 10,000 years of humans have left me.  The logic of plato, the philosophies of socraties, the critical reasoning of Randi, the skepticism of schermer, the observations of sagan, paine, nobel, russel, raynd, ohare, jefferson, monroe, adams and everyone between.  We have been provided the tools, not to use them is irresponsible.  You may interpret my conviction as arrogance, but I tell you it is from having examined this and argued it both with myself and others a thousand times over.  I say that if something can't be proven it shouldn't be treated as true, that is not arrogance, that is common sense.  What arrogance to me would be is saying that despite evidence to the contrary, my incorrect belief was still right and that nothing you can say will change my mind.  That is arrogance.<br>

<br>
Exactly. I heard a comic on the radio, talking about Christians who were going on and one about the afterlife, and how terrific Heaven was. His point, and I thought it was rather well taken, was if it's so fab to be there, why do Christians wear seatbelts and use bungee cords when they jump off high places? When they get sick or injured, why do they get medical attention? Why are Christians, for the large part, so virulently prolife and anti-euthanasia, if Heaven is so terrific? Wouldn't it be better to just get on with it in this perfect place? And why was it such a big deal for one man to be killed and go to Heaven to satisfy dad's craving for blood in these imperfect humans that he supposedly created, if Heaven is such a swell place...<br>
<br>
I know the comic took it too far with the seatbelt thing, but he had a point.<br>

<br>
yes! Christ suffered and died for everyone. However, those who were born before Christ had a different knowledge. They had been given the law of Moses, or before that, they lived by other philosophies. Every person will be judged based on his/her understanding. Those who came before Christ would not be expected to live as Christ taught because He had not been here yet.  But Christ still suffered and died for their sins. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;To say you think the nature of a thing is one way simply because you cannot conceive of or don’t like any other way is not logical nor good enough reason to build a belief system on. &lt;&lt;<br>

<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I've never understood this. Why did Christ's death bring about salvation for all humans? &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Actually it wasn't his death that brought about salvation. Salvation was brought about because he suffered in the Garden of Gethsemane for our sins. For every sin, there must be an accounting. It is like if you break the law locally, a judge will sentence you to something. Well, Christ did the suffering, felt the pain, experienced what we would have if we had to account for all our sins on our own. Christ did that so that we could repent. The significance of Christ's death wasn't so much that He died as it is that He raised up after 3 days. It is the resurrection, the victory over death so that we won't all just end here but that we can live again with God. Again, this is a belief system which obviously, using the dictates of man, cannot be proven...<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;And why, if heaven is such a swell place, is it even considered a sacrifice?&lt;&lt; Christ didn't sacrifice heaven, he sacrificed his life, he sufferred, see above answer..... <br>

I do expect that there will be opposing opinions and that is ok. If you sense frustration, it is most likely because I know that this is an argument I can't win with you.

<br>
&gt;&gt;The reason they get the time and energy defnding them is because people THINK it has value. &lt;&lt; <br>
<br>
Does this imply that the dried flowers I kept from my grandmother's funeral have no value also, I just think they do? Because whether they have value to anyone else, they hold great value to me. Religion is much the same way. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Because of religion you have countless murders, wars and oppressions. Racism, hatered and tribalism.&lt;&lt; <br>
<br>
People do things in the name of God that are horrible, but that mean that God is to blame? Assuming there is a God, which I believe there is, making people do these things you mention would go completely against His own plan. It would be Satan's way, not God's way. God makes no one do anything... people may use God as their excuse, but it does not make Him ultimately responsible.  People are accountable for their own actions... same reason we don't believe that men are punished for Adam's choices. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;There is a difference between the justifiable confidence that springs from security in a position and the arrogance of believeing you cannot be challenged. I do not presume that I cannot be disproven. &lt;&lt; <br>
<br>
I was not saying that I could not be disproven. There are people all the time trying to show LDS people why they are wrong. I take the time to look at what they say and I am fairly confident that what they are saying simply isn't true. The problem here is like trying to compare apples and oranges because, as you said, you don't believe anything until it is proven to you, and I believe even without *proof*. I realize that you may find that naive and may say my brain is falling out of my head <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . That is ok. It isn't that I don't think I can be challenged. I come here right? But, just as I will never convince you without scientific proof, you will not convince me that without scientific proof, it must not exist. As I said before, there are many proofs which have not in the past been able to be proven, and many things now that are still not &quot;provable&quot; but that doesn't mean that they don't exist or are false.  Therefore, we are at a stand still on this issue. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I would dearly love to think I can see my mom again, that the girl who killed herself in high school will tell me why she did it, that my dad will have his leg again and get to chase me as we did when I was a kid, that my time with my wife will never end, that I can watch my kids, grandkids, greatgrandkids all grow up and have families. &lt;&lt; <br>
<br>
In that case, I hope I am right! <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;How then to distinguish between competing beliefs? &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
The funny thing about you asking that, is that very question is what led Joseph Smith to a grove of trees to ask God which church he should join... He says he then saw God and Jesus Christ and was given direction from them. Does he have proof? Nope. Only his word. So, if there is no God, he was a liar and a fraud and we have all been duped. If he was not lying, then there is a God. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I say that if something can't be proven it shouldn't be treated as true&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
So, if you had lived in the 1960s and you had slept with a girl who got pregnant and she had also been with someone else at the same time and you and the other guy both had the same blood type, even if that child looked just like you, would you default to there being no chance of it being yours because you can't prove that it is? Or if someone were to commit a crime against your family and there were clues that led you to believe you knew who did it, would you automatically assume that that person couldn't have done it because there is no absolute proof? Do you really think that everything that can't be &quot;proven&quot; is automatically false? <br>
<br>
I wasn't calling you arrogant, per se, only that when you are unwilling to see that there are people out there who may reason through things differently than you, you think that they are idiots. The thing I thought was arrogant is believing that your way of determining truth is the only acceptable way. It may be the only way for you but that shouldn't completely discredit other people because they perceive things different than you do.<br>
<br>
Anyway... off to my mom's for dinner... Check back later.<br>
<br>
Heather<br>
<br>
ps.... DBC, I hope you know that I respect you and your beliefs, reasoning, etc. I am not trying to tell you that you are wrong or change your thinking. I just expect that you will respect that I can be a pretty intelligent person and not reason things the way you do. <br>

I can take things in the spirit with which they are intended with the best of them, but in that analogy, someone here has to be the pig, so you may want to refrain from that particular analogy. It's actually quite rude. It's like someone saying, &quot;Well, I shouldn't explain X, because Y is too stupid to get it right&quot;.  <br>
<br>
That isn't in the spirit of debate. That's just a huffy way of saying that because we don't share what you believe, it's our problem. We're defective or lower than you. The LDS that I *know* (and that's mainly Paige and Whanda from previous boards), wouldn't have that attitude, don't have that attitude and I would never expect it from them. <br>
<br>
Not exactly words to keep everyone smiling.<br>

I did not mean to ask why heaven itself was considered a sacrifice;  I meant why was Christ's death and suffering such a sacrifice, if it was in fact his vehicle to glory.<br>
<br>
I understand the concept of crime and punishment.  What eludes me, however, is how someone else's sacrifice (if it can be called that) would offset own sins.  A judge sentences criminals -- not people who knew the criminals, but had nothing to do with their crimes.  It is an ill-fitting analogy.<br>
<br>
As a parent, would you willfully watch one of your children suffer as a means for forgiving an act of disobedience by your other children?  It makes no sense.  So why would an all-knowing, all-loving god find this appropriate?<br>
<br>
Dags -  Congratulations:  yours is the first uncivil remark on this thread.  No offense intended?  Yeah, right.   <br>

“So, if there is no God, he was a liar and a fraud and we have all been duped. If he was not lying, then there is a God.”<br>
Or he was mentally ill but thought he was telling the truth in which case he was not a liar, but there is still no god.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Heather—I know you are above responding to dag, and you made good points about the value of your beliefs (that although you expect retort, you do not expect to win a debate given that they are based on faith). For the record too, though you are correct you cannot prove your god above others I think you have started to distinguish your doctrine on hell and salvation from that of other xians, but don’t know if the coliseum or xian thread is a better place to debate. I noticed you didn’t have much luck over there either. <br>
<br>
In either case, should you choose to continue casting pearls, diamonds or other assorted gems down into the mud, at least I can follow your train of thought--you even mixed in the responses in one big thread--very convenient.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
