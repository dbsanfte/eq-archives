Well, my main question is about the late Princess Margaret. I'm wondering what you all think: should she have been allowed to marry Capt. Peter Townshend? I think she should have been allowed to do so. That was the man she truly loved, yes? My mom feels she was never the same after she was not allowed to marry him. Would her marrying him have changed her role as Princess?<br>
<br>
Also, why is it in the Royal Family they're not allowed to marry someone who's been divorced before? I never understood that. I remember hearing how King Edward (it WAS Edward, right?) abdicated the throne for the woman he loved.<br>
<br>
And, 1 more thing: is Prince Charles being allowed to marry Camilla Parker-Bowles? <p></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/ustarryeyed4paul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StarryEyed4Paul</A> at: 8/8/02 3:03:33 pm<br></i></span><hr size=1>    <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCE6FF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/udashofmooo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dash Of Mooo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.users.dialstart.net/~dashland/html/Strobe.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www.users.dialstart.net/~dashland/html/lene1c.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Shimmering Ocean<br />Debates Editor<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-5.gif /></span><br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 8/8/02 9:57:22 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: Love/Marriage in the Royal Family</span><hr size=1> It's all to do with keeping up traditional values and morals. I'm hardly an expert on this subject, but as far as I'm aware the Royal Family as a matter of principle(whether they agree or not) holds itself strictly to church of England 'rules'. Marrying a divorcee is not considered proper, nor is marrying someone of considerable lower social standing.<br>
<br>
Yes it sounds crazy by modern standards, but this is how it was many years ago - and why not keep these traditions up? As a royal you don't really have a life, or a choice...your just servants to the greater public.<br>
<br>
As far as we are aware Prince Charles has not yet been given the go ahead by the Queen to marry miss Bowles, yet increasingly she is being allowed to play a more public role, which may indicate that the mood in the palace is changing.<br>

My mistake...<br>
<br>
I personally think they shouldn't just be removed, but some of them should be killed.<br>
<br>
Charles will marry her, unless they split up. The Queen will have to give the go ahead. It's unlikely he will change his mind. Then, I hope, Prince Harry will become King, and maybe give the Royals a bit more excitement. They are extremely boring after all. He is more likely to be the king with 12 wives, drug addiction, alcoholic raver etc.  - it would do britain good..<br>
<br>
Firstly, we need to stop the war with Iraq. Save the Zimbabwee'an white farmers, kill George Bush and also kill Osama never bin Found. They we need to all become hippies, save the world, green peace rule, and the world flooding doesn't. Support green peace and the london subways won't get flooded. Support green peace and you can walk and not go in the car, hippies rule. Off topic? Well, yes, but then the royal family are off-topic. They have been for several centuries.<br>
<br>
I hope the future brings a better Britain, which the people control, and not a dictatorship with Queen Blair and Priminister Elizabeth waving at the crowds.<br>

Harry Potter was taking drugs, yep. He was caught smoking waccy baccy in a shed at the local pub. Charles brought him to drug-relief center in London to show him how much it affects people. Not because Harry might need help like that, but to stop him taking it again. It's also good for the press.<br>
<br>
Prince Charles is next in line. He doesn't want to be King.<br>
Prince William apparently doesn't want to be either.<br>
Prince Harry is too young to decide.

Harry was brought to the center for one afternoon to see the effects of waccy baccy and other drugs on people. He didn't actually join any center, that does never happen to a royal. It was just a press attempt to show that the royal family can face everyday situation and that they aren't really stuck in the past. In actual fact, they are stuck around 1000 years behind and it was just a press secretary that came up with the idea of him visiting the center. There is nothing wrong with smoking dope anyhow, it's good for the body and soul and better than alcohol or tobacco. <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>    <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/ustarryeyed4paul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StarryEyed4Paul</A> </span><br><BR><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/f_a_y/paul4judy_pp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60><br> <span class=usertitle>Ticklebunny<br />Profile Assistant<br /><img src='http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-admin.gif' /></span><br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 8/14/02 9:31:47 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Re: Love/Marriage in the Royal Family</span><hr size=1> Hi Peter!!

The royals are 1000 years behind the times? Hmm...I remember when I watched something on the Queen it said how she/the Royal Family were behind the times, &amp; how the Queen tried to keep up w/the times...I saw a clip where she met the Beatles back in the 60's. <br>
<br>
It's interesting you mentioned there's nothing wrong w/smoking dope in comparison to drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco, because 1 of my friends was talking last night about dope smoking vs. tobacco smoking. He used to smoke dope for awhile, but he stopped. Now he's smoking tobacco.

Dash thinks that if you wish to discuss a specific topic, that thy should start a topic that deals with this, not subtly bend topics to change them to something you would much rather discuss.<br>

I'm not much of a  royalist, apparently neither are many others here, so I don't really have much of an opinion on your question.<br>
<br>
However I did find this article while doing some research.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://senrs.com/britain's_princess_margaret_dies_at_71.htm">senrs.com/britain's_princess_margaret_dies_at_71.htm</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
It's quite a good topic - and may give you some answers to your questions.<br>
<br>
Happy reading,<br>
