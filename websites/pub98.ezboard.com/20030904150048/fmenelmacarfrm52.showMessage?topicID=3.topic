<br>
        The first post to the board! With these words, Thomas Hubert inaugurated the new communist nation of Varja on July 15, 2002, the one thousand seventy fourth day of the Apollo Era, an event which, like all others, was the result of the infinite past and the cause of an infinite future. The specific past that led to the founding of Varja and to this less than awe-inspiring historical post was perhaps a little checkered. Thomas had been involved in a number of wars, crimes (if indeed there be difference between the two) and other unsavory events for the past two years, until finally he had been forced to leave micronationalism. Now he had returned under the name ElDorni, in the hope that his old enemies would not recognize him, at the head of a column of friends and acquaintances from the Elendor MUSH.<br>
        A MUSH, Sirithil nos Feanor once explained to me, is a Multi-User Shared Hallucination, a category of experience which bears a difference from the usual Role-Playing-Game that is highly significant for Role-Players and totally invisible to the rest of us. This specifically Hallucination happened to be one based in the universe of Middle-Earth, J.R.R. Tolkiens hauntingly beautiful and stunningly complex world in which were set the events of the Silmarillion and of his most famous work, The Lord of the Rings. Elendor was filled with elves, orcs, and even the occasional Dunedain, heir to the lost kings of Numenor. Thomas Hubert had been in Elendor for some time, and was well-acquainted with its many members. When it came time for his clandestine return to micronationalism, he had no trouble recruiting his friend and fellow leftist, Zarathustra Erutirn (a leftist Nietzschean  someone must be turning over in their grave for that) and a number of other Elendorites eager to try this new style of sim.<br>
        Thus July 15th, 2002, and that first post to the board. The second and third posts to the board were the equally propitious comments Hola and Testing  but things began to get interesting soon enough. The first true event of the new nation was the visit of Baracaoan diplomat Dafydd Young, an extremely high-ranking member of the micronational worlds largest and most successful communist republic. But things soon became more interesting than Acting Prime Minister (for so he was) Hubert had bargained for. Minister Young noticed a stray link to Thomas old email address in the forum code, and ElDornis secret was out before it even really began. Dafydd was asked to keep it quiet  and did so admirably  but a wise man once said that three people could keep a secret so long as two of them were dead, and after Youngs fellow Baracaon Edward Guimont found out as well, there was no helping the thing.<br>
        The secret soon spread to the worst possible person  Scott Siskind, editor of what was then the micronational worlds largest newspaper, the Apollo Skyline. It was announced to the world, and at least ElDorni admitted his identity. But, he said, his previous less than sterling reputation was due to a character  a mask he had worn and acted the part of to liven up the pace of events. Now he was going to be the real Thomas Hubert, a Thomas Hubert who could work intelligently with other people and who was committed to peace, justice, and international cooperation. While a number of people refused to believe him, some Varjans, like Zarathustra Erutirn, vouched for their friend, and the micronational world came to a general consensus to forgive him until they saw a reason to do otherwise. <br>
        And so Varja went on, none the worse for its first international crisis. Although it had been founded as a communist state, it was still basically democratic, the theory being that an intelligent citizenry would, when given free choice, elect communists to national office. Now this theory was to be put to the test, as political conflicts began to surface. Varjas first scandal, in the words of republican leader Sirithil nos Feanor, was the adoption of a constitution by Hubert without any debate, discussion, or popular vote. Friedrich Bakunin, a communist, answered that, as a communist document, it was made to protect the people and that Sirithil, as a capitalist would-be oppressor, had no right to interfere with that function. The eventual vote that led out of this matter, a proposed amendment by Sirithil to add a basic bill of rights to the constitution and clarify election procedures, ended strongly in favor of the communists, but Sirithil warned prophetically that if by Election Day I am still the only one defending the people's freedoms, you may be surprised by the results<br>
        And this election day approached very, very, quickly. Thomas had set ten citizens as the magic number before the country would have its first big vote, and the tenth citizen joined Varja on July 20th. Elections were scheduled for the 24th, with the most important position, that of Prime Minister, hanging in the balance. Factions, parties, and cliques took shape at astonishing speed. The most powerful was the Communist Party of Varja, which predictably nominated Hubert for their Prime Ministerial candidate, but very close behind was the Varjan Republican Party under Sirithil. A distant third was Gozzles Monarchist Party. There were countless debates devolving into arguments devolving into name-calling between Thomas and Sirithil  and then the election arrived.<br>
        Seven to four to two, Sirithils victory. Everyone was very surprised, and no one more so than Thomas Hubert and his Communist Party. One gets the feeling that they did not actually expect for a democracy to actually be a force for change as much as an interesting ornament to their simulation, but they were awakened quite rudely. And Sirithil nos Feanor, probably already working on her acceptance speech, was awakened even more rudely when she learned that she would not have to give it after all. Thomas Hubert simply refused to accept the results and told the monarchist and republican parties to take a hike.<br>
        The rest of the micronational world was not especially pleased at this. This seemed to be that proof that Thomas Hubert was back to his old tricks that they had been waiting for. Most of the great powers of the day, these being Babkha, Attera, and Tymaria, unequivocally condemned the seizure  the exception being Baracao, which is not quite so against EZOp based coups as they would like you to think, so long as the instigators of those coups are ideologically sound. Edward Guimont, representing the Baracaoan government, promised the support of the Baracaoan militia to the communists, while the republicans and monarchists still sat, slightly dazed and horrified. <br>
        But they did not sit still for long. Sirithil spoke out against what she referred to as a coup in posts which have, unfortunately, been edited and are no longer accessible. Thomas supporters, particularly Erutirn and Bakunin, branded her a counter-revolutionary traitor, and Thomas soon banned her and her two prime supporters, Adam Safran and Phoenix Valor. A few foreign dignitaries, like Ardashir Shah of Babkha and Eoin Dornan of Treesia, came around to yell at Thomas or to generally make fun of him, while Ryan Caruso, who is also not quite as against EZOp coups as he likes people to believe, wandered around trying to convince people that what was done was done and they should forget about it and go home. Eventually, the furor died down, aided along by the bannings of all who discussed the issue, and Thomas was unchallenged Prime Minister of Varja.<br>
        That was when Sirithil nos Feanor decided to found Menelmacar.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E4705><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bmenelmacar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archetype23>Archetype23</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://collectiveunconscious.port5.com/Animations/Roma.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Scrolls<br>

<br>
I believe this contains a bit of Anti-Warvoid sentiments.(Ryan Caruso).  Ryan has since this event changed that is obvious and it seems Siskind wishes everyone to beleive that Ryan is the same man today as he was when the Varja incident took place.   Especially since he speaks on behalf of Ryan Caruso which in itself is wrong. &quot;while Ryan Caruso, who is also not quite as against EZOp coups as he likes people to believe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ryan's actions now prove that is very much against EZ OP abuse like Sirithil performed and Siskind is therefore wrong to make this character call.  I believe in the revivsed version it should say.<br>

<br>
Well, for as much as I can remember, this seems pretty accurate. I recall that when I posted first, Hubert attacked me, claiming I was &quot;out to get him&quot; or to just assume rule of Varja, or something. He had also classified me as an immature idiot to Sirithil. I made him apologise, but it was the first hint I saw that he wasn't &quot;showing the real Hubert&quot; now. <p>Zirandorthel<br>

Again this is the past.  Warvoid does not currently do these things, nor do I believe he would.  PRH seemed like quite a big joke to me also.  He may have been serious, but this was also an attempt by him to portray himself as Evil (ruling hell.)  However he does not, nor has taken land unlawfully since he has joined Menelmacar.  He has changed in my opinion, I believe it is wrong for Scott to portray him like something he isn't in a history paper.  <br>

Sure he did a good job researching I never said he didn't. I also thanked him many times for this document.  BUT it does contain a vast ammount of errors and that is what this class is for, to try and root them out, and make it a bit better document.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well, for as much as I can remember, this seems pretty accurate.
