Anyhow, I want to put the theory to you, why can't we transport food to the poor people of this world. I am surprised that we can't get more food transported to African and other starving nations. Does anyone have any comments on why we can't get more, even with the navy merchant ships or something? Of course not all food could be moved, but alot could. Starving people aren't usually fussy.<br>
<br>
Also, has anyone accepted by task, not to eat meat for one whole day and see if they find it possible? <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fbbardenfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=8><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <br><br></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/bbbarden.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=swallow>Swallow</A> </span><br><br> <span class=usertitle>Evolving Lake<br /><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/levels/userlevel-2-3.gif /></span><br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m width=80%><span class=m><font color=#FF0000>Posted: 9/21/02 9:17:54 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span class=title> Veganism</span><hr size=1> Okay, I'm going to try to answer ALL the questions, forgive me if I miss something out! <br>
<br>
Confounding: I am a vegan - I have been since I was 8 years old, so in the begining it <br>
was not *my* decision, though I remember many disscussions over nutrition. Before <br>
that I was vegetarian since birth. I did guess that you might be  a vegetarian <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Littlelisa: You fall prey to common MYTH number one, calcium is in no way a problem<br>
for vegans, dark green vegetables, soya, seeds grains and nuts are plentiful source<br>
If you stop and think about drinking cows milk, you will realise just how unnatrual it actually<br>
is: There is no dispute over our insides NOT being made to take this stuff. This is infants<br>
milk, specificly made for calves... just like our milk is made for our young.<br>
I do not take any sort of supplements- in fact I am am no more concerned about nutrition<br>
than anyone else, I eat the usual three meals a day... and there is even ice- cream! <br>
Believe me, veganism is not a sacrifice! Having said that it was at first, and you do tend<br>
to be over conscious of, *oh no whats in this??* but it sets in, and supermarkets are<br>
so much better than they used to be.<br>
Another thing, don't get me wrong, I do care about animal welfare, I was just trying to <br>
show the alternative view <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Dash: (this will be long!!!). I agree we are not like herbivores, obvoiusly we can't live on grass!<br>
The pattern of organs in our bodies and the composition of our blood are identical <br>
(more or less hehe) of those of the great apes - chimpanzees gorillas etc - . early man was probably not the violent hunter of common belief, and probably undertook the <br>
canivorous diet because of violent climate change, the migration north, and the dissapearance of plant cover (ice age related). Well, I could give you the details, but I'll just say we are made like frugivorous apes; Not like carnivors at all.<br>
<br>
How can the people in the poorer parts of the world produce it themselves???? With things like drout in their every day lives? The farmers among them are mostly controlled by large corporations, growing &quot;cash&quot; crops... it is a vicious circle. Places like the Sahara desert are getting bigger due to over grazing... I am interested in your strong viewpoints, I shall have to get more info to set up ammunition <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
I totally disagree with you over health, no we can not have a balanced healthy meat diet. As I tried to prove earlier, it is not neccessary let alone health or natrual. Take a look in you local factory farm, its shocking that we think healthy food can be produced in such a place. It really sickens me.   <br>
<br>
Actually I eat almost completely organic food as well as <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I tell you though I have a normal diet- I eat normal food! I don't watch vitamin intake, I never worry about nutrition, and I am perfectly heathly ( that goes for this half of my family as well).<br>
<br>
Dash- do tell us more of your views! <br>
<br>
Okay, thats enough of me for now...<br>

I'm a bit slower now..lol..hard work all this thinking.<br>
<br>
Here we go.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> early man was probably not the violent hunter of common belief<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again I disagree. Without sounding like a complete geek - I wrote an essay on early man, and more precisely the role it played in the big game extinctions. Of course the conclusions are debateable but I think man was a meat only eater in those days before he was forced to adapt to a more sedentary lifestyle. Of course it depends how far back you go because of course the great apes eat plants(although cannibalism has been noted in chimps). I was desperate to give you the essay(mainly because im rather proud of it *gloat*), but I cant seem to find it anywhere on my pc. Perhaps once im back at uni ill find it on my disk space there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How can the people in the poorer parts of the world produce it themselves???? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think here you may have misunderstood me here or muddled up different points(thats probably my fault though..lol).  In the current environment those people cannot support themselves. Sahara is getting bigger etc.etc. Your completely right. My point though was, that with more advanced and new farming techniques it may be quite feasible to support the populations. I apreciate this isn't possible without money though.  Imagine having the British farming industry set up in Africa? The world would drown under the food produced. Its wishfull thinking with the damage already done - but we are talking pretty theoretically here anyway. Look @ Mesopotamia. From the most productive piece of land on the planet to now being a near desert. Mismanagement.<br>
<br>
With regards to modern farming - well I see your point. As you may have guessed my dad is closely involved in the farming industry. I've seen the bad sides(I daren't reveal) but in fairness I've also seen enough that makes me fairly certain that the food I eat is safe. I'm not a great organic fan because, although I apreciate its theoretical advantages, I have seen what goes on. I'm not trying to produce scare stories but too me food produced by non-organic means are as safe as organics. Thats a personal opinion of course though. As is the judgement of what you see in the animal rights campaign horror videos on chicken farming, is actually like that everywhere.<br>
<br>
I'm no nutrition expert...and I really cant say I think what you say is wrong with regards to meat. I do still believe though, that everything in moderation is fine. Meat, sugar, alcohol..whatever. I like to think (with the exception of my student binge drinking), I live a healthy lifestyle.<br>
<br>
Hey..thats not bad for having a sore head.<br>
<br>
Like I said before ... good discussion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Your essay sounds interesting, I always loved history <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Okay, lets not argue about that because everything we say is based on assumption- more or less.<br>
I know that the horror movies that Animal welfare groups put out are extreme... However I have had first hand experience- I live on a farm. I have also heard first hand stories (from a meat eater!) from soemone who worked in a slaughter house. Meat the way it is produced to day is unhealthy. Milk, cows milk, on the other hand where does that come into it? Why are we drinking this stuff?<br>
World hunger is a major problem, they will be no one solution. My nutrition info I can assure you is from good sources <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyway, must go...<br>

I would like to search for a vegan who is fat, as I believe as a vegetarian I don't get the proper things I need and I probably would have a bit more muscles if I ate some meat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  lol<br>

Okay what do I eat in a day? Usually:<br>
Toast for breakfast<br>
Pasta, Macaroni cheese or beans on toast for lunch.<br>
 Dinner is usually something with vegetables, but we have things like pizza too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
I sometimes eat chocolate and other sweet things too (homemade chocolates cakes yummmmmmmyy!!) Its hard to say beacause it can be so different from day to day.<br>
<br>
I never really eat out, I was put off restaurants quite a while ago- Hygiene above all else put me off.  Eating out usually means bringing sandwiches <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/lol.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But you get used to it.
