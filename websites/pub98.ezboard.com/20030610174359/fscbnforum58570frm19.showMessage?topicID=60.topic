<br>
: Drev walked side by side with Alia his own head bowed contemplating what may be his last night to walk the earth. Many things ran through his head causing him to randomly look up in start at more passing revolations which were quickly forgotten with the realisation that his time in this world may run out before the weeks end. Alia continually looked over in worry, every now and again resting a comforthing hand upon his shoulder. Everytime she touched him, she felt his muscles tence and he would shy away slightly. She had never seen him in such a condition before.:<br>
<br>
Alia, :he said in a near inaudiable voice: I will return to you in time for the gathering under this evenings full moon. I would just like some time alone. I would like to sort out my thoughts a bit before I join you. I promise you i wont go far. :Alia nods to him and proceeds to the gathering. Right as she leaves, she hears Drev's hands gripping onto the bark of the tree they had just passed. When she turned to look, Drev had already reached the thick of the tree hidden within the leaves of shadows where he knew he could find peace and quite where he wouldn't be disturbed.:<br>
<br>
: Drev pushed himself back into his meditative state in which he found the most clerity. He slowly opened his eyes when his sharp hearing caught a random snap of a twig. He sat completely still as he narrowed his eyes to see into the darkness. They took on a redish hue, but he was high enough and deep enough within the tree to remain completely concealed and not pull attention despite the glowing orbs floating within the trees many brances. A dark figure walked completely covered from head to toe in black with a large black scarf crossed over his face. Drev narrowed his eyes a bit. Drev blinked to see if this creature were an illusion or not, but when his eyes reopened, the figure was gone. Drev furrowed his brow in confusion. His concentration had been broked fully with the thought of a possible threat to Alia and her friends who weren't too far off.:<br>
<br>
:With that, Drev jumped down with a loud thud, placed his hands into his hoody pocket and extended his deadly claws. Every few steps he would look over his shoulder and when he would look ahead, his eyes darted from one side to the other in suspision. He had to watch over Alia while he still could. The conversation earlier that night about the Tremere and Alia directly shook him up a bit. While he still had the ability to do so, he was going to be by Alia's side and protect her.: I don't want to let you down again Alia. :he whispers to himself as he walks to the gathering where Alia waits for his return:  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=60.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=60.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=60.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=60.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=60.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=60.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm20">SchreckNET™ (Nos only)<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.241b<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
