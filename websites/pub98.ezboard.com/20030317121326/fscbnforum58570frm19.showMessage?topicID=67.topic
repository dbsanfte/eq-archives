The feeling of a part of their mutual soul being torn away was all they could feel as Thomas’ head was separated from his shoulders by the powerful claws of the beast. All that was left was that last image from Thomas and awareness of each other in the darkness.<br>
<br>
The body was moved and Monica could feel some of the signals in the nerves as she had before with Thomas but this was different. The signals were much stronger and unfiltered. She realized that quite slowly she was receiving sensation similar to having her own body. Wendy was surprised to be feeling some of the sensations also. It was the first time since Thomas had incorporated her into them.<br>
<br>
Thomas’ soul no longer with them, Monica and Wendy felt themselves merge even further into each other as the body lay in its coffin. Eventually their young embrace released them from the paralyzing bonds of Torpor. And they both knew that they were still in a great deal of jeopardy. <br>
<br>
With experience of healing and the power of the supernatural blood, Monica regenerated a new head and patiently moved her brain into place. She hadn’t realized that she re-grew her own visage and wasn’t quite aware of the monstrosity she had made as she’d moved her brain, making tissue corrections by touch only.<br>
<br>
She set to the task of digging out from the earth. The powers of bonecraft and fleshcraft let Monica alter her body to make quick work of the task but the thirst for blood became very powerful. They both knew they had to feed soon. The frenzy was near as their beasts beckoned them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the small hours of the morning, in an unmarked grave with a recent covering of sod, a sharply clawed, misshapen hand burst upward through the soil. And shortly thereafter a horribly disfigured face emerged after a second clawed hand broke the surface. <br>
<br>
Monica/Wendy pulled itself, naked and horrid, from the grave; a dark terrifying birth. The kids partying several hundred feet away didn’t hear the being emerge and they were surprised by its quiet approach.<br>
<br>
Monica/Wendy decided, after draining the two kids she’d lamed with sharp claws, to use the face and name of one of these victims. At the edge of the graveyard, the street yielded a truck parked on the roadside that was blessed with large mirrors. After the appropriate alterations were made she (now most definitely a he) returned to the bodies and took the identification of the young man.<br>
<br>
They laughed out loud to discover the boy’s first name being Jack. So Jack would be most fitting not only because of the past use of the name but because Monica and Wendy both preferred to remain in this male form due to the unjust male chauvinistic advantages within society both human and vampire.<br>
<br>
Hunting down four more victims before the night’s end, Jack replenished blood without further killings. The two that were in the graveyard were easily hidden inside a sepulcher and Jack left the graveyard to find the chantry.<br>
<br>
Spending a few nights outside the chantry an apprentice and a gargoyle finally came out to confront him. After asking meticulous questions about the new gargoyles and identifying himself as someone who knew Thomas most intimately, Jack was admitted and soon conferring with the Regent. Quickly the recognition was made with the Regent and the prior offer of service was reaffirmed along with the contract. <br>
<br>
Jack was immediately taken unto the Regent’s care and was counseled to deal with the loss of Thomas and the painful memories of their time together. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jack would miss Thomas. So many stories and so many things Thomas had told him. All of his experiences of re-awakening in Nevada and relearning how to be in human society were so sad. To think that Thomas died thinking he was trying to keep the Sabbat away. Surely, someone else must have seen that.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, Thomas’ viciousness was his downfall and impatience was his herald. Jack would not be so shortsighted. Survival and evolution were now paramount. Jack wished Thomas had listened.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Goodbye Thomas.<br>
<br>
(  o.o.c. not quite what anyone was expecting??  )<br>

&quot;Intolerable!<br>
Irreguardless of the Regent and Nathan's direct instructions, Harry brown had seen too damn much. If any of those Dominating assholes like the Ventrue go digging into his head, they will clearly see what Powers we have!<br>
God damn, if the shit at the farm house weren't the biggest cluster fuck I've had the displeasure of participating in! And if Prophet figures out how those implants were removed, what the hell will keep him from betraying us to Marie?&quot;<br>
<br>
Monica:<br>
&quot;Prophet always going to the power like a moth to a flame says nothing about his dependability, I wonder if he'll string Marie out like he did with Nikkie. Too bad Herald has probably heard that Thomas is dead. Not that he'd want further dealings with us after he had been told that I was touted as speaking for the loonies and agreeing to kill Nikkie.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wendy:<br>
&quot;Well, I can see how it looked that way, Thomas didn't remain firm against being at the priogen meetings and speaking his mind. You give him too much credit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Monica:<br>
&quot;I can't help it. You know what I mean. He meant so much! It is so empty with him gone. It's like we were closer but didn't really realize it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wendy:<br>
&quot;I miss him too...&quot;<br>
<br>
Both of them lost briefly in grief, Jack opens the text on the labratory counter and begins absorbing the details in the Feline Anatomy text. He takes in the sections on the hearing, nerve connection and paw sections. He spends hours going over the extending claws and the deep ear shapes and sensitive muscles that move the ears.<br>
<br>
Wendy:<br>
&quot;We should talk to the regent about Harry Brown. He cannot have the opportunity to inadvertantly betray us or our service to the clan. The higher circles wouldn't tolerate Eric's use of us in the current capacity. If we were converted completely, I'm sure they wouldn't object. But if they find out, his punishment would certainly include our demise.&quot;<br>
<br>
Monica:<br>
You and I both know that this is the best place to further our evolution and that we cannot walk away. You heard the discussion about our contract. The consequences are too great to take that risk. We must evolve!&quot;<br>
<br>
Wendy:<br>
I know. I'm just worried.&quot;<br>
<br>
The anatomical study pays off as Jack forms the hands of the current project construct. The ligament/tendon alterations and the nerve connections completed, he tests the muscle reaction with a low electrical pulse. Heads in the Labratory Turn with wide eyes as Jack laughs, delighted as the claws snap quickly forth from the fingertips, he brings the rest of the apprentices over to see the results and critique the effectiveness of their function. Then he discusses the alteration and shows them the proceedure.<br>
<br>
Finally he finishes the evenings work in a discussion of the function of the feline ears with the rest of the apprentices. He looks forward to the next evening's work. So many possibilities and so many things to test.<br>
