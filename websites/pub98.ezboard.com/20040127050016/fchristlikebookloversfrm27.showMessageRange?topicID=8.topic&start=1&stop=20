Happy Mother's Day to everyone out there.  My mom is currently at the Y-me breast cancer race downtown, and we (my sister, brother, cousin, and I) were supposed to go with her, but since it's rainy and yucky and cold outside, I'm sitting home on my computer.<br>
<br>
Last night I had my cast party for my ice show.  It was, in a word, unbelievable.  I had the time of my life.  When I first got there (45 minutes late because I was on here and messing with my siggy.  Isn't it beautiful?), we were eating, and I only had a little.  Just for the record, I can't stand the way I look, and I really struggle with that aspect of me.  We then sat around and talked for a while.  I found out my coach from my old team (I just made the best one at our rink <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :party --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/crz/crz_151.gif ALT=":party"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) has been fired.  I don't know all the details, but I am kind of sad.  She didn't have a great personality as a coach, but I liked her as a person, and she did amazing things to our synchronized skating team in the past year.  After talking for a while (and complaining about the music-we weren't happy about it) they started handing out awards, which this year were gold medals, since it had been called A Salute to the Olympics on Ice.  <br>
<br>
That was when te fun stuff started.  One of my really good friends, Melanie, and I went to the ice rink to see if it was wet (she loves to make herself fall on wet ice.  It's a strange little inside joke), and we noticed the one good guy skater from our rink, Alan, making out with his girlfriend.  We were thoroughly disgusted <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   , but we went and told the rest of the people we were haning out with (Nikki, Tim, Sabrina, Francis, Joey, Lakendra, Sonya, Julia, and Hayley).  Just to be the annoying people we are, we went up to the stands, and just started talking, which apparently annoyed Alan and his gf.  Braulio, Hayley's little brother, went and was annoying them, but we had stopped caring.  Finally, later on, we were allowed to go on the ice.  A lot of girls hadn't brought their skates, so when we weren't allowed to each only wear one, girls started getting rental skates, and wearing one $500 (or so) skate, and one cheap rental.  It was quite amusing.  However, we soon got a little bored with that (the ice was bad, and there wasn't enough room to practice, and we didn't feel like practicing, we were feeling to goofy.), so we went back up to the stands and stood around there talking for a while.  Melanie had also talked to Alan, who was apparently mad at us, so she hid from him for the rest of the night, which provided us with great amusment.<br>
<br>
Then we went back to the lobby (where the dj was) and we all danced to Cha cha slide, which is one of my favorite things to do.  It's a tradition!  We hung out there for the rest of the night, dancing and singing.  I talked to one girl from my rink who's graduating this year from Whitney Young, the high school I'm going to next year.  She said 'Now here's someone smart enough to go the Whitney Young next year!'  And then Erin, another girl I know pretty well, who goes to Northside College Prep, debatably the best HS in Chicago, said 'Only because she wasn't smart enough to get into Northside.'  Now that made me mad.  I've wanted to go to NCP for three years (since it opened) and it hurt a lot that I wasn't accepted.  I wrote out a whole narrative on it, and if any of you want to read it, just tell me and I'll post it.  I shook it off, but that was the one blemish of the evening.  We danced until 10, when I had to leave.  I was very unhappy my parents came when they did, because they were starting to play 'You're the One That I Want' from Grease, which is one of my favorite songs.  I had a blast!<br>
<br>
Also yesterday I had my first group lesson for our new session, and I had a hard time.  For the past year, I've been with teachers who really let you practice what you know you need to practice, and simply offer advice.  My new group coach (I have a private coach as well) does everything where she tells us what to do, and if I can to a nine revolution sit spin, and another kid can't do three, we continue working on them for a lot longer than I need.  Hopefully it'll turn out okay.<br>
Well, tonight I have ice dance.  Everybody, watch Hershey's Kisses competition this afternoon!  I'll try to post tomorrow, but I don't know if I'll be able to.<br>

Edited because I'm a horrible person who forgot to talk about books!-------<br>
Well, I finished the new Lurlene McDaniel ('Telling Christina Goodbye') on Thursday, and I loved it!  That's all you'll ever hear from me about Lurlene's books-I love them all! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :heart --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/herz.gif ALT=":heart"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, Friday afternoon I finished read 'And This is Laura.'  I started it Friday afternoon, too, but I had to steal it from my library (with the permission of our librarian) because 8th graders aren't allowed to check out books anymore, since we graduate so soon.  It's about a girl name Laura (duh!) who has ESP.  It's an old book, from the 70's, but it was really interesting.  I enjoy older books about science fiction things, such as 'The Girl With the Silver Eyes' by Willo Davis Roberts, but I can't stand modern ones except 'Contact', which I loved! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/ukatey14abc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>katey14abc</A> at: 5/12/02 8:40:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/ukatey14abc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>katey14abc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><marquee><font size=2 color=darkorchid><b>I am a memeber here at CLBL.

Ice dance yesterday was a blast, I haven't gone since before the ice show practices (about three months ago) because the meanie ol' hockey players had the rink!  One of my coaches little brother's was there, and he was cute!  And I'm not your typical boy-crazy 13-year-old (only for 19 more days!), so that's saying something.  My friends were very impressed, because it was really saying something if I bothered to bring him up.<br>
<br>
School today wasn't that bad, which was nice.  It's been absolutely dreadful for the past two weeks, so this was nice.  One of my two best friends and I were getting very excited about our 8th grade trip this Thursday, and we're already planning movies, cd's, etc.  We're on a mission to find 'The Cutting Edge' soundtrack, because there's this one really pretty song on it ('Turning Circles') we both want.  Who ever finds it first buys it, and then we split the cost.  I'm also trying to find the 'Love Story' soundtrack for the simple reason that my dear Jamie and David skated to it.  The music is great, if you haven't heard it, listen!  Gorgeous!  The movies we'll bring are as followed: Center Stage (I got it for $5 yesterday!), The Cutting Edge (we have a strange obsession with it, and we know all the lines by heart!  If no one else wants to watch it, Edna is brining her laptop, and she has the DVD, so we'll watch it on there), Contact, Save the Last Dance, 10 Things I Hate About You, and maybe a few others.  <br>
<br>
I'm the only experience one in my 8th grade with bus trips, because of my synchronized skating ones, so I'm going to be an insufferable know-it-all!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    We leave at 5:45 in the morning, so I'll also be the only one fully awake.  I'm up at 4:15 to skate at 5:45 a few times a week (including tomorrow), and up at five for my alone time the rest of the week.  I'm warning people that I'll be incredibly hyper.  I always am at that time.  <br>
<br>
I got my 2nd issue of Cicada today, and I love it!  I'm planning on editing my Northside essay (the one I previously mentioned) and sending it in.  I doubt it'll be accepted, but at least I can get some feedback.  I also might shorten another short story I wrote (do you want me to post it @ GLO?  I'm considering it) and send it in.  I'm very protective of my writing, and I hate to show anything other than my best, which is why I'm hesitant.  <br>
<br>
Hmm, not much else interesting happened in school today.  We listened to out 8th grade speeches for the Dinner/Dance and Graduation.  The girl who was in charge of my group's speech lost half of it, so she re-wrote it, and it's not very good at all.  I'm kind of mad about it, but another part of me doesn't even care anymore.  I'm really getting apathetic about graduation.  It started once we got the high school news, and is just getting stronger and stronger.  I hurt so much everytime I hear about Northside, and it just eats away at me.  I've been having dreams about high schools, always second-guessing the decision I made, and going to Northside.  While today was a good day overall, in terms of high school references, it was bad.  Way too many people mentioning it, and whenever anyone does, I have to hold back tears.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow morning I have my first practice on my Junior Classic team at my rink, and I'm nervous! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Pray for me, you guys!<br>

I finished 'When Happily Ever After Ends' today, my 2nd to last Lurlene McDaniel to read.  One more left!  It was good, but you could definitely tell her writing has improved a lot since then (it came out in '92, right when her OLW series was starting).  Also, because her son has juvenile diabetes, I think she can relate to those books a little better.  This one was about a girl, Shannon, whose father killed himself.  It was good, and I liked a lot of the characters-very real people!  Tomorrow I start 'Hang A Thousand Trees With Ribbons' and catch up on 'Pride and Prejudice'-I've gotten so many Lurlene McDaniel's lately, I've been slacking off.  <br>

Bad day.  Worst since my string of bad days started, May 1st.  I just went back to check, for some crazy reason.  I really feel awful, even after coming home and bawling my eyes out for a good hour or so and seeing that my dad got me 'The Cutting Edge' Cd, which I've been dying for for a while.  That helped, but I had some really awful stuff at school and skating today.<br>
<br>
Skating started off bad because (as I said before) it was my first day on the best team at my rink.  We warmed up as a group (we share Tuesday morning ice with my old team), and then they started doing footwork, and we started doing double back lunge passthroughs.  As I know those sound very confusing, imagine it like this: two lines of 12 (or so) girls connected.  We go backwards at each other, bend down into a lunge position, and drop arms with the girls next to us.  We have a space in the other line to go through, and hopefully we all go through cleanly and at the same time.  Well, I was having a really hard time, going down late almost every time since I haven't done those for a year.  It's a natural instinct to hesitate, but you just have to fight it-it's a lot harder than it seems.  I'm also missing my Thursday practice because of the 8th grade trip that I never wanted to go to in the first place, and after today I don't want to much more.  It's a long story, so I'll think I'll talk about it tomorrow, since I have to go to bed now.  I have to skate @ 5:45 again tomorrow, which means wake up at 4:15.  I just think I'm going to copy and paste the essay I've mentioned before so you guys kind of get an idea of how this depression began.  It's been getting progressively worse, but I have enough to think about now.<br>
-------------------<br>
Three years.  Three years of my life I had wanted to go to Northside College Prep for High School.  And now, with one letter, my dream had been dashed to pieces.  The dream I had based stories on, future plans on.  I had been warned by many people not to set my heart on getting accepted to the most sought-after high school in the Chicago area.  I’d assured them I wouldn’t, that I had other options.  But making plans in the case of disappointment and actually being forced to carry them out were two entirely different things.  There was still the possibility of being accepted on a waiting list, but did I really want to get my hopes up again?  And even if it happened, did I want to feel like a second-class citizen my whole life there?  <br>
I tried to comfort myself, and called my best friends, Julie and Edna.  They both tried to console me, but I was feeling as if I was a failure.  Every assignment I had worried about with Northside in mind, every straight-A report card had been a relief, knowing Northside could see no better.  I had prepared for the entrance test as best that I could, and had received a 99% composite at the other school I had applied to.  Yet, how heart-wrenching it had been, knowing my best wasn’t good enough.  Despite all my work and dedication, I wasn’t good enough for the school of my dreams.<br>
I woke up the next morning with the same dismal thought running through my head.  The world seemed unchanged, yet I looked at everything with a much more bitter, cynical point of view. <br>
“Katherine, I don’t believe in ‘mental health days,’” my mom told me, referring to the days many acquaintances were permitted to say home, “but today is understandable.  You don’t have to go to school if you don’t want to.”  She left for work with that option left up to me.  I decided it was better to face the music.  Seven hours later, I definitely regretted my decision.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The day had been spent explaining how I couldn’t’ve gotten in, discovering that three people had been fortunate enough to get in, and trying to keep myself from coming up with ‘what ifs.’  I held back tears countless times, trying to find something, anything, that could keep my mind off my lost chance.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After I got home, I received a phone call from Julia Atkison, my best friend from skating.  She, heartbroken and resentful as I was, had the same disappointing story.  After an emotional discussion, we could come to few plausible reasons.  A highly unlikely one: we had both bombed the entrance test.  She had also received a 99% composite at St. Ignatius, so without proof until our scores arrived, we dismissed the idea.  The most reasonable that we could devise was based on a petty but entirely true fact: we were both Caucasian girls living on the North side of the city.  It was a well-known fact acceptance was based on, in part, location, gender, and, most of all, race.  The facts we had supported our theory.  Of the ten people we knew accepted, nine were black, Hispanic, Indian, or Asian, and six were boys.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Was this why?  Maybe, maybe not.  Would I still attend if accepted on the waiting list?  Most likely.  Would it be the same?  No.  I would hopefully be able to move on, but this could easily and understandably put a dark mark on my high school years.  I put the dreams of Northside aside, discontinued my fictional stories, and started rebuilding my plans.  The one thing I hesitated in doing was dreaming and wishing.  I didn’t want to get hurt, never in the way I just had been.  So for a while, I think I’ll try to stay in the real world, in present day, rather than a fictional dream of the future.<br>
-----------------<br>
Books:<br>
Well, I didn't really read a lot today.  I did read another chapter or so of Pride and Prejudice.  Lizzy just got away from marrying Mr. Collins-yahoo!  That was one of the few good things today.

I got a reply!  Muah, Amber, thank you!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Well, our 8th grade trip is tomorrow (I will survive!  As long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive.  I've got all my life to live and all my love to give.  I will survive.  I will survive.  Hey, hey!  Okie, I'll stop now), and we're going to a series of different places.  We leave @ 5:45 in the morning, and I'm kind of mad about the time.  If we left earlier in the morning, I'd be able to sleep for the first few hours, if we left later I could skate and/or I wouldn't need to sleep.  But since I'm so used to this time, I'll be incredibly hyper at school, and everyone else will be exhausted.  Once again, I find myself wishing I were going with my skating team.  I love those bus trips!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :down --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/nsrtrts/nsrtrts_134.gif ALT=":down"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  to school trips.  We then drive for about four/five hours heading west.  We pass Galena, IL, Dubuque, Iowa, and some other places, and stop at Diresville, Iowa.  There we see the Field of Dreams, and the boys play baseball, and the girls sit around at talk, from what I've heard.  We also eat lunch then.  After that we head back east, and stop ad Dubuque, Iowa.  There we take a boat ride on the MS river.  After that we go to Galena, and then we go to Ulysses S. Grant's house, and another house.  For the last hour or so in Galena, we can shop.  There might be book stores, which is always a good thing!  Then we drive home, stop for dinner at Old Country Buffet (gaah.  Another place I'm not so fond of.  Very fatty food.  And they value quanity over quality, which is understandable, but doesn't make it tase better), and go back to school at 8:30.<br>
<br>
I'm still not looking forward to it, but I'll survive *I hope*  If I don't post again, y'all know why.  And if you miss me, take a case against my school (ahh I can see it now...GLO or CLBL vs. Northside Catholic Academy.  Go GLO &amp; CLBL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cheerleader --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/crz/crz_94.gif ALT=":cheerleader"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ).  <br>
<br>
I had a little better day at school today.  One girl who has really started to shun me was absent.  We carpool together, our families are close friends, but a lot of things have made it tense between us.  She seems naturally kind of a spiteful person, I think.  She resented me at the begining of the year, because I started hanging out with some other girls.  Then she also started hanging out with us, and I suspect she's been talking about me, because I've been 'dropped' kind of, from the group.  I haven't confronted her, because I don't want to offend her, especially if she didn't do anything.  However, for the past few months (she was one of the people who got into Northside College Prep) she's been dropping spiteful little comments that really get under your skin.  Numerous times she'll mention the fact she got in, and I didn't.  I usually remain civil, but as soon as I'm alone, I break into tears.  Those types of things can really start to hurt.  I've managed to keep my cool, but I've been able to feel myself losing it lately, so that's why it was a good thing she wasn't there today, I need a break from her to calm down.<br>
<br>
Our Dinner/Dance banquet is a, well, dinner/dance banquet.  Very descriptive, huh?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/happy.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Basically, we all come to the gym (don't worry Amber, my school's cheap too.  Otherwise we wouldn't be the only 8th grade I know of who's not going to DC for an 8th grade trip!) for a catered dinner.  During that time, we listen to speeches, and receive awards-lots and lots of awards.  After that, a dj is there, and the first dance is a father/daughter, mother/son dance.  Then the parents go to a different room for coffee and socializing, and we stay in the gym for dancing and socializing.  It's the last part I really don't like.  I skipped all the school dances this year for a reason-I don't like them, and with the maturity level of the kids, they're not worth it.  <br>
<br>
At graduation we have two more speeches, more awards (I'm gonna get a gold cord!  yay!), and the handing out of diploma's-you know, typical stuff.  And afterwards (if I choose to, and destiny allows me)  I never have to see the people again!  14 and 1/2 days left!<br>
<br>
Amber, I can almost definitely get into NCP next year, if I apply.  You see, by then, they've taken out all the people who simply test well, and those with behavioral issues.  As long as I keep an A/B average at Whitney Young, it's almost a garuntee that I will.  However, if I like WY, I may not want to leave, and if I do still want to go to NCP, I will have a lot of issues of seeing myself lower than everyone accepted right away.  Well, my mom contacted a possible psychiatrist, because I've been having such a hard time for so long.  I hope that will help.  Amber, thank you for caring!  It's nice to have a little sympathy.<br>
<br>
Keep me in your prayers tomorrow, guys, I'm going to have a hard time.  <br>

I'm horrible.  Forgot to post books:<br>
One girl gave me two books to read today.  I started Gathering Blue (Lois Lowry), and it's really good.  So far it's about a crippled girl who's mother dies.  Her community (in particular, a very spiteful, influential woman) wants to send her out into to wilderness, where she will be killed by animals.  *shudders*  She is an excellent weaver, but because she cannot fend for herself, she is considered worthless.  I'll no doubt finish this, and many others tomorrow.  Whenever I'm on bus trips, I bury my face in a book, listen to CD's, and tune out the rest of the world.  However, that's hard to do on skating trips, unless it's early in the morning (once we had to leave around 4:30!) or late at night (we commonly don't get back until midnight), because the rest of the time, we goof off and watch movies.  *sigh*  I really am going to miss my skating friends tomorrow.  We have so many inside jokes about buses, it'll be weird not having them here.<br>

We had to write it in letter form for the current 7th graders, so some of it I didn't focus on as much.  As you can tell, I read a TON!  I added in a few more things to post it here, and I'll add more at the bottom.<br>
-------------<br>
As we boarded the Coach USA buses in our parking lot at 5:50 am, cries of ‘I’m tired’ and ‘I wanna go back to bed’ rang in my ears.  As a figure skater who wakes up regularly at 4 am, I was wide awake, but it was obviously more difficult for my classmates.  For about an hour and a half, we drove (I believe they started watching Ace Ventura during this time, but I was reading ‘Gathering Blue’ and listening to music, the Cutting Edge soundtrack) until we stopped at a McDonald’s.  Most people bought some breakfast food (gag!  It smelled sick) and souvenirs (why exactly do 8th graders need shot glasses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :crazy --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/glcklch/glcklch_14.gif ALT=":crazy"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and then we re-boarded the buses.  We drove for about two more hours, and we also watched ‘Rush Hour 2.’  However, I paid attention to very little of the movies, and had finished one book by the time we stopped at a tower where we took a fifteen minute break to run around.  Most people raced up the steps to see the view, only to be terrified by the height we were at.  I enjoyed it until I felt the tower start to shake, at which point I immediately ran back down.<br>
After driving for a few more uneventful hours, we arrived at the Field of Dreams.  During the last few hours on the bus, people started to wake up a little, and converse.  I many times felt like I was under a thorough psychiatric investigation about my spending the entire trip reading and listening to music.  At the beginning, I had attempted to watch one of my movies (I had brought ‘Center Stage’ and ‘The Cutting Edge’) but they were thoroughly rejected by the people on my bus.  Thus, as I was not interested in the movies they chose to watch, I had now objection to reading countless books and listening to music they would no doubt disapprove of as well.<br>
At Field of Dreams, there was already another school there.  I’m quite sure we intimidated them, as we had been sitting for so long that when we were finally freed, we were crazy.  After some of us listened to a monologue about the history (Ms. Clements insisted) and the other school left, the boys and some teachers took the field and played for about a half hour, while the girls watched, talking, played crazy games, and I read a book!  At that time it was ‘Dreams of Gold,’ which I always keep in my purse and have re-read it so many times that there is hardly a point to reading it anymore, as I know it almost by heard.<br>
When we went back on the bus, we did not watch a movie, despite the constant nagging of everyone on the bus.  Ms. Clements claimed we would be there in 15 or 20 minutes, but it took at least 45 to get to the Mississippi for our boat trip.  We took a ride for about an hour and a half, and it wasn’t very exciting.  It was, however, cold, and, again, I spent most of the time reading.  After than ride, which was mostly uneventful, we started driving to Galena.  During that trip, we watched ‘Save the Last Dance,’ which I love, mostly because of the dance scenes.  I was also told I looked like the main character (Julia Stiles, who plays Sara Johnson), and I took that as a huge compliment.  That was the only movie I really paid attention to.<br>
Once we reached Galena, we had a tour of the Dowling house, the first one built there, in 1826.  I didn’t really enjoy it, mostly because they even admitted that almost none of it was authentic, which took away from the charm.  We also went to Ulysses S. Grant’s house, which also seemed like a tourist trap, because he spent less than two years of his life there.  We were running late, so we only had a half hour to shop, almost all of which I spent in a Christian bookstore, ‘Chapter and Verse.’  I would’ve loved a few more hours there, and some more money to spend, too!  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys books, and would willingly go back just for that store.  On the way home, we stopped at Old Country Buffet, where there was very little significant that happened (basically, it was a bunch of crazy 8th graders acting like 2nd graders).  En route to Chicago, we watched ‘Field of Dreams,’ but few people paid attention, and the main excitement was that Nicole had gotten gum in her hair.  We arrived 15 minutes late (8:45) and people fled immediately, ready to go back home and sleep.<br>
Overall, while it was fun, it wasn’t extraordinary.  I read over four books, and reading those and going to Chapter and Verse was the best for me, personally.  As I had been debated whether or not to attend, I had been hoping to be completely won over.  It wasn’t so, but it wasn’t terrible, either.  And just for the record, Gathering Blue, by Lois Lowry, is an excellent book, and Robin Jones Gunn is the best young adult Christian author I have ever read, without a doubt!<br>
-------<br>
Well, I hope you didn't mind that too much.  As a matter of fact, the last sentances (about the books!) I did include in the 7th grade version!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I also have to mention that the guy (Colin) who said I looked like Julia Stiles is now permanently on my good list, and it my favorite person in the world for the moment.  I love her movies, and think she's gorgeous!  So that was quite a compliment.  Also he and the Nicole who got gum in her hair are going out, and were being a very cute couple on the bus.  Time to go babysit, I think all the times I mentioned books in there are good enough for a book review for today.  I'll no doubt post more tomorrow!<br>

I'm absolutely insane today, so as I've said a few times, I should be completely ignored and not allowed on the internet.  However, no one in my family has seemed willing to attempt to keep me off, so I'm still here!  <br>
<br>
Last Night, I babysat for these two boys about three blocks away-they're pretty good normally, but the younger one (age 4) was sick and whiney, which wasn't fun.  I came home early (my mom had offered to come watch, since I had to get up to skate), but couldn't sleep, so I came here for a while.  When I finally did fall asleep, I woke up at 3:30 with a bloody nose, and did get back asleep for another hour or so.  Then I woke up at 5:45 to skate.  It was okay, but gosh, how much I hate my axel.  I wish so much I hadit, and had it clean, but wishing can't make it happen-ask any figure skater.  I've been working on it for two years now, and last summer I had it consistent for two weeks, but then my rink closed for a month, and I couldn't skate as much.  Dwelling on my axel can be really depressing.  I've also been having trouble spinning lately, which makes me mad-I've always loved spinning!  It's frustrating when something you love so much just isn't working.<br>
<br>
I also had to babysit my little brother and his friend today, which contributed to my exhaustion.  They're both 4, and require SO much watching.  I really don't like babysitting a lot, but I need the money, so I do it.  I can't wait until I'm 16, then I can work in a bookstore or something.<br>
<br>
Things are getting very complicated with the teams at my rink.  Two years ago, and for many years before that, there was a Youth-Large ISI (a less competitive organization) team at my rink, a Teen-Large ISI group, and from there, about a third of the best skaters from there on a Teen Intro USFSA (the more competitive, official skating organization) team, a Junior Classic USFSA team, and an Adult team.  Last year, a new coach came, and we re-did a lot of it.  The youngest team competed USFSA Juvenile, instead of two middle teams (my team) there was one, and we competed USFSA Intermediate, and the Junior Classic stayed the same.  The Junior Classic did very well, as usual, and the two other teams slowly improved.  This year, the young team went back to ISI, they created a Youth Intro USFSA team, Intermediate went to Teen Intro (the coach was not very well liked, so not enough people tried out) and once again, Junior Classic, the team I tried out for and made, stayed the same.  However, the Coach of Teen Intro/Intermediate really wants a competitive team that can go to Nationals (Any Intro teams and Junior Classic cannot, Intermediate can), so she's trying everything she can to get enough good skaters.  Before her idea was cross-skating, where girls would skate on both teams.  However, it turns out girls can't cross-skate down, only up.  So now she wants all the girls 15 and under (there's an age limit for intermediate) on the J.C. team to skate Intermediate, and the girls older to be teen intro, which is a huge step down for them.<br>
<br>
I, being 13, would be on the Intermediate team, but I really don't like this coach.  However, I really want to go to Nationals, and I want to do Synchro in college, so I can't afford to take a year off.  I'm not quite sure what'll come out of it, but I'm really worried abou this, because I want to have fun, but I don't want to stop if I won't, becuase doing it in college is really important to me.  We'll see what happens, please pray for me!<br>
And even though I have tons more to write, I won't, because I think people stop reading b/c I write too much.<br>
Books----<br>
The book I got in Galena was a Christy Miller I haven't read-Island Dreamer.  I loved it!  It was a quick read, but so romantic, and so true to life-aren't we all always tempted to be jealous, and to flirt, throw ourselves at guys?  I also thought it was a good example about how people can drift apart, but still can be on good terms.<br>

Well, I slept better last night, so I'm a little less crazy today.  I really didn't do much of anything today.  I went to church in the morning, and was on the computer, and reading, and doing laundry-nothing too thrilling.  I've been having an argument with my mom lately about church.  Since I was five, I've been going to St. Gertrude's, where I was happy going until last year.  However, I've been feeling uncomfortable, and since spring break, I've been going to St. Gregory's, which is closer to my house.  My mom's okay with it for now, but she wants me to start going with my family again.  <br>
<br>
Hmm, I went to ice dance again today-I love it!  It's so much fun to skate and not worry about my axel, or my jumps, or anything like that-just skate.  So much fun.  It's a good thing I have ice dance Sunday nights, because I usually need something to cheer me up before I go back to school.  Alana and Elena (four of the girls in dance are: Alana, Elena, Elena, and Eliana!) were being nuts-Alana especially cracks me up, because she's in love (or so she thinks) with Charlie, our coach's little brother.  He's the one I think is cute-I got to partner with him twice today! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :crush --><img src=http://www.plauder-smilies.de/love/loveya.gif ALT=":crush"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I also talked to Liz, who said she'd have space to coach me privately in Ice Dance over the summer, so I can start testing- Yay!  I like it so much, it's completely worth getting up early for!<br>
<br>
My mom was late, so I got to talk to my friend Katie for a while.  She's the funniest!  She was supposed to be on the ice, but was being an evil girl, and was trying to annoy Liz, so she took her own sweet time.  She went through Emily's pocket, stole 98 cents b/c she wanted to buy ice cream, stole 2 cents from me, and discovered the snack bar was closed.  Then she called her mom and asked her if she would make her a jean purse, like mine (I know crazy girl!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :crazy --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/glcklch/glcklch_14.gif ALT=":crazy"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Well, she then went to change, but her tights were too wet, so she came back out and put on her skates with her socks.  We were talking, and apparantly she's still dating David, her boyfriend, but she kissed a guy in her Science class and she had to tell David and now it's all messed up.  That's what I like hanging out with Katie so much-she completely makes me forget my problems!<br>
<br>
I also saw Ryder (one of my bestest friends) today, and I was sooo careful with what I said.  We're throwing her a surprise graduation party (she's graduating from 8th, like me) on Saturday, and I'm excited!  And I was also telling her about the crazy behavior of the boys on my bus.<br>
<br>
---Books<br>
I'm a horrible person who spent all of today making a pointless PowerPoint, and only read the Perspective section in the newspaper-there was a very interesting editorial about graduating, which I liked.  Hmm, to all teen girls out there, I'd recommend Second Star to The Right, which is about a girl with Anorexia/Bulemia.  It's horribly realistic, but unforgettable.  Read it!<br>
Still 12 and 1/2 days 'till graduation, but we're getting there.  It'll be less next time I post!  *Katherine hums 'I Will Survive', her new theme song!*<br>
Luv y'all (I miss my friend who always said y'all, so I've been saying it lately)!  <br>

Hmm..Novelistic..new word-I like it!  I've also come up travestical.  The English language simply isn't descriptive enough.<br>
<br>
School today was-school.  Boring.  This is our last full week of school this year (we have Memorial day off next week, and a picnic that Friday, and the next week, we have a half day Thursday for the 8th graders-and then we graduate!), so the teachers are taking the chance to cram as much material as possible into our meager brains.  The only thing I don't like about that is that it's tedious.  I can handle all the material-it's easy!  I just can't stand all the written work.  I'm feeling really down for some reason.  I think I'm stressed out about my synchro decision-hopefully I won't have to make it.  And I have my second Junior Classic practice tomorrow-I have got to get myself to do the double back lunge splice right!  <br>
<br>
I'm also thinking all about my social stress at school.  It's not easy, to say the least.  My friend Julie is quickly becoming one of my best friends-she's the only one who hasn't deserted me during this hard time.  Laura never cared to beging with, Nancy and Farhana left almost exactly when it started, and for the past few weeks, Edna (aka Ella) has been drifting away, too.   I have to give her credit-she stuck it out a lot longer than most people would've.  Julie's just been great, though, she's so supportive.  I don't know what I would've done without her.  Oh, and my boy troubles-it really makes a person feel lonely when she sees all sorts of people around her going out, and she's been asked out once-and it wasn't very seriously.  It's even worse when I try soooo hard not to let boys affect me.  It's like I don't want them to have power over me, but I can't stop it.  gaaaah!  I hate being a teenager!  Speaking of which, my B-day is June 3rd-I can't wait!  And four days after that, I graduate.  I'm really not feeling up to writing much now, so I guess I'll stop before I depress the rest of you.  <br>
Books---------<br>
Once again, I'm a horrible person.  I only read a few pages of Pride and Prejudice today, and Macbeth in school.  Oh wait-I was super-bored this morning so I read 'Help!  I'm Trapped in a Movie Star's Body'  Like I said, I was really, really bored. It was a pointless book, and I've got to get around to reading my Ann Rinaldi.  However, my story-writing is going pretty well!  <br>
Well, talk to y'all later.  Like always, keep me in your prayers!<br>

This is, without a doubt, the best news since I discovered Michelle's gonna go to 2003 Worlds in DC.  I've just gotten to be big fans of those two, and can't believe they (Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz, by the way.  They're Canadian Ice Dancers) had the nerve to go and tell Skate Canada before us, their obsessed fans?  Hmph.  Katey is miffed.  But they're staying, so I'll forgive them!!!  I love them!<br>
<br>
Okay, calming down now.  I can't post much more (darn!) because I have to get up early again tomorrow.  My knee is killing me, because of the back lunges in practice this morning.  I've been limping around all day.  The girl who doesn't like Lurlene McDaniels, and has been acting spiteful to me for the past few months is still doing so, so that's not much fun.  I'm a horrible person (actually a busy person), so I didn't get any reading done today, either.  But I have a study hall tomorrow, so hopefully I will.  But don't count on it.  Now I REALLY have to go, so g'bye, y'all!  <br>

My music/movement teacher (it's a long story, if you really want to know, ask, but I don't want to go over it at the moment) got mad at me in front of the whole class because I was standing in first position, which I do naturally, because I'm always working on my turnout.  I almost started crying, because I've been singled out-whether it's for reading, being considered a 'goody-goody', being quiet, not getting into NCP, whatever-a million times this week, and I'm sick of it.  Gah!  So this was the 'last phone book' in the words of our dear friend Katie.  And I've also stolen the word 'peachy' from her.  Only I say it like it's something bad.  Anyway, at science lab, the kids were going crazy-spilling water, throwing wet paper towels, you name.  Ya, it's safe to say school is coming to an end.  Then we went to church to listen to a guy in charge of a youth ministry program, and I have to say I wasn't very impressed-it seemed more focused on social events than actual ministry, or regular meetings.  So, although I was thinking of joining it, I'm probably going to look elsewhere.  Also, the fact that I'll see all the kids from my school is not something I'm exactly looking forward to.  We had a short Language Arts (my favorite class!) because of that, so we didn't do a lot of interesting stuff.  During lunch and recess, I snuck my notebook with stories in it outside because I wasn't much up to socializing.  However, one girl was going on to me about how I needed to eat more-I eat breakfast occasionally, no lunch, a healthy snack, and small dinner-and I'm getting sick of it.  Everyone is constantly on my back about that stuff, and it's annoying.  Makes you want to scream.  Social Studies wasn't that great today either, and Computer wasn't too bad, because I was done with the assignment already, and was able to write my story then, too.  Study Hall drove me crazy-the one girl, who's name is Laura, has been irritating me to no end.  I'm just so sick of having her build herself up by putting other people (mostly me) down, and having everyone else think it's hysterical-because it hurts.  All the snide comments she makes are related to grades, smartness, and high school-she got into NCP, and I didn't-and she just seems to need to convince herself she deserved it by putting me down.  I understand it, but it doesn't make it hurt any less.  Well, I'm going to bed now, and please let tomorrow be better, please!!!!!!!!!  Love ya'll!<br>

Thank you world!  Okay, don't ask-it's from a song I did at my ice show two years ago, from the Wiz.  Today was soooo much fun!  Okay, so school stunk (like always!), but everything else was awesome!!!!<br>
<br>
When I woke up (4:30, thanks to my mental alarm clock), I'd just had a dream about high school-a good dream!  I've been having nightmares-literally (everything from being abducted to school shootings, all happening at various schools that I hadn't chosen, so I kept on second-guessing my choice).  This one took place at the high school where I will attend (Whitney Young Magnet), and everything felt so right.  I was happy, I had friends, I fit in, I enjoyed the curriculum, it was so amazing.  It was everything NCA isn't, it was like-home.  Such an awesome thing.  It has definitely helped, however, because it seems like I sign I'll be okay, I can handle it, it's where I'm meant to go.<br>
<br>
That really put me in a good mood, but school easily ruined that.  However, I got a huge presentation out of the way, and I found out no more Social Studies tests this year!  And after tomorrow, no more Religion ones, either.  We have one Math next week, probably no more Science, and a huge L.A. project due June 3rd-my birthday!  Argh-no fair no fair no fair!  I'm rather upset about that last one.  Then I came home, and I went to my first Thursday evening Junior Classic synchro practice-it was soooooo much fun!  We warmed up (very exhausting), did bauers in a line (I love these!), did brackets and choctaws, and then worked on the double back lunge pass through.  Well, it's going better for me, but as a group, it's getting worse.  I did it exactly right numerous times, but about half the times when our coach (Kathy) was watching, I ended up on my rear-end.  Owwwww!  Just the same, I can tell I'm getting better, and I'm getting to know everyone better, too.  In off-ice, we jogged, did a bunch of upperbody exercises (gah-I have weak arms), and did team-building activities.  It was hysterical!  When I got into my car (my parents never come in, they just wait outside) I turned to my mom and said &quot;I haven't said this in a million years, but I love synchro!  I love it!&quot;  I'm still in a great mood from that, especially because last year's synchro team was the opposite of fun.  <br>
<br>
Now, I have to go vacuum and then type up a piece I'm sending to the Chicago Trib-I hope they consider it!  It's in response to an editorial on the school system.  Gotta go now, my mom's yelling.<br>

This is which skating princess I am, and I've no objection-I love Fumie, she's such a wonderful skater.  Her Moonlight Sonata was amazing this year.  Lori Nichol can work wonders on anyone!  And since I was bored, I messed around until I got Michelle, who of course I have to post:<br>

And since I was really bored, I did the guys, too:<br>

Timmy's cool, so that's fine with me.  Hmm, I survived school today!  Always a good thing.  It's sooooo boring.  Every day is the same-the material is too easy, the same people hate me, the same people don't mind me, the same people goof off, and so on.  Actually, I got one surprise today-a girl I've gotten pretty close to (or at least closer to) in the past few weeks wrote me a note, and we've been talking a little more.  She's a good friend, but it's kind of sad we're only starting to talk now, just barely before we leave.  She's Nicole, the one going out with Colin who got gum stuck in her hair in the 8th grade trip.  I'm just trying to remember when I would've mentioned her here.<br>
<br>
I was sooooo sore today from all the synchro yesterday, but I had so much fun it was completely worth it.  Tomorrow I skate in the morning, and get my hair done at two-I'm thrilled!!!!  A layered cut-minimal, I don't want it short, and highlights!!!  It's so expensive it counts as a birthday gift, too (my b-day is June 3rd), but that's okay with me.  And in the evening in my friend Ryder's graduation party-lucky girl is out already!  I'm jealous!<br>
<br>
Today I went to a therapist because of all the problems I've been having.  I don't know, it's kind of weird.  I have enough trouble expressing myself to some of my best friends, how would I be able to do it to a complete stranger?  I'm going back next week, but I don't know if I will after that.  I'm not a person who tells others things openly, so it's hard.  I wish I had a good friend to talk to, I think that would be a little more helpful or comfortable for me.  If any of you want to post your IMs in here, I'd like to talk to you guys.  I'm gonna go watch Center Stage-I like dance movies.  Or maybe I'll watch the Cutting Edge-I love that movie.  Talk to y'all later!<br>

I'm a horrible person who deserves to be burnt at the stake-or I'll just post more.  I've had a crazy weekend, what with my cousins over, my friends party, shopping, getting my hair done, and so much more.  I really don't feel like dwelling on some things, but I want to give an overview.<br>
On Friday-oh wait, I already posted on Friday.  Scratch that!<br>
<br>
On Saturday-I skated in the morning, like always.  Fun but exhaustificating.  My cousins went to a museum, and my mom and I went shopping for something for me to wear to the dinner/dance, but didn't find anything.  I did, however, get four new books!  After that, we went to get my hair done!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hairman --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/crz/crz_95.gif ALT=":hairman"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I got it cut and got these golden brown highlights, with a little red.  They blend in really well, but make my hair look lighter, which is what I was going for-a natural look.  Then, after I came home, I went to my friend's party.  It was fun!  Another girl from skating (that's where I met Ryder) was there, and we went crazy.  The other three girls ended up sleeping over, and I should've, but didn't.  Ah well.  c'est la vie.<br>
<br>
On Sunday I went to church, and hung out with my cousins.  Nothing too thrilling, but enjoyable nevertheless.  And I went to ice dance!!!!  Have I mentioned yet that I love ice dance?  Even if I did-I love ice dance!  Then I went to a BBQ with some friends of the family.  On Monday (God bless all days off!!!)  I went shopping with my friend.  Now, let it be known far and wide I am not a big shopper-I like clothes, but not enough to spend all day with them.  So it was a hard day, but hey, I found an outfit, and I got another new book, so it was tolerable.  However, we didn't get home 'till an hour and a half after was originally intended, and that made me MAD!!!!  <br>
<br>
Tuesday I skated in the morning (let it be known far and wide that you should not let go of anyone surrounding you in a shoot the duck circle!), and school was blech.  I hate that place.  My ride in the mornings (I car pool with the infamous Laura, the one who's spiteful, and got into Northside, and is intent on making my life miserable) is always late, and it drives me crazy! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :crazy --><img src=http://imbiss-coding.de/smiliez.de/smz/glcklch/glcklch_14.gif ALT=":crazy"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm extremely punctual, and since I always get other people places on time, I expect them to do the same for me.  Nothing else really happened.<br>
<br>
Today I skated in the morning (my proclamation for today is that SP-Teri's, my brand of skates, really and truly are SP-Terrorists, as my old coach calls them!), and it was fun, since I didn't have to do axels!  Lots of spins (falling on flying camels, especially when you almost get it, is not fun!), and fun jump combos.  Laura was late AGAIN this morning, and I told her I'd like it if she could come a little earlier, because it was cutting it too close, and she said &quot;Oh Katherine, stop it.  You should be glad you're even getting a ride!&quot;  GAAAAAAAHHHHH!  Just for the record, I'd rather leave early and walk than be late with people who think it's acceptable.  Not to mention we always drive her, as well, and we are always on time, so that's a lame excuse.  She's driving me nuts, and I'm counting down the days until I don't have to see her every day-Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, and I'm done!!  It's awful, but she's testing my patience so much!  Ooo-and today was my last double period science, and science test!  I've almost made it!  And maybe I'll post tomorrow-but don't count on it.<br>
