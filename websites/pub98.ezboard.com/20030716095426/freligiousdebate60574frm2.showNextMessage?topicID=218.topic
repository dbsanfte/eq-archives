<br>
This same topic came up in the care center I worked in a number of years ago.  The policy allowed for  person to state a preference in the gender of the nurses aide, but we had a patient who did not want anyone who was not white to be her aide.  As her social worker, I was apalled.  We did not honor her wishes, but she was so racist that she would make derogatory statements, use the N word and other words to the point that the black and Hispanic aides ended up asking us to make sure her aides were white because they were tired of her abuse. (she was not demented either,if she had had Alzheimer's I would have been more likely to cut her some slack.)<br>
<br>
There was even some debate on our policy of having a gender preference, but we excused it as part of that generation and the modesty issues with hands on personal care.  <br>
<br>
So what do you all think, what things should we have a choice in that deal directly with us and what things should we not?  -- Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> M2</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#3333ff>(5/29/03 3:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=210.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  PS</span><hr size=1> Do you like the title, LOL I thought it would snag some interest.......<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phoenix24601>Phoenix24601</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#3333ff>(5/29/03 4:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=210.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: PS</span><hr size=1> It is a shame that some people are that petty.  It seems to me that if these things are allowed to ensue, then that will encourage discrimination in the workplace.  If enough people who frequent a local choose to act against a specific background, then it will be increasingly difficult for those people to gain employment there, as a large group of the clients will complain.  My opinion is that when you look at a person, you shouldn't see things like race/sex/religion/etc.  Although, it is probably easier for me to say that because I already refuse to generalize anyone.  Each person is a blank slate as far as I am concerned until they put something upon that slate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luvthatdyl>LuvThatDyl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#3333ff>(5/29/03 4:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=210.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  right to choose</span><hr size=1> Yes, I did think this was an abortion thread at first.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think this depends on the type of service we are talking about.  Everyone has different reasons why they may or may not be comfortable with someone.  You may go visit a doctor and realize he reminds you too much of a kid you hated in school.  This would influence whether or not you were happy with this doctor, and could ultimately lead you to choosing a different doctor for no reason other than that he looked like that kid at school.  When it comes to race or religion, then the subject seems a little more touchy because of the lack of political correctness.  If someone doesn't like the fact that an African-American is delivering their newspaper, then that is tough.  The newspaper company shouldn't have to change their routes around because of a racist customer.  When it comes to a very personal service, such as that from a doctor or attorney, then a person will want to feel comfortable on all fronts.  I still think it is sad that someone would be so racist as to shun someone like that, but it is still their right to do so.  <br>
<br>
Where attorneys are concerned, there is sometimes a different matter.  Sometimes people pick certain attorneys to score brownie points with the jury.  A rapist may have a woman attorney, and a person who committed a hate crime may have a black attorney.  This tactic throws the jury for a loop.  They might say &quot;that guy can't be racist enough to perform a hate crime, look at his attorney&quot;.  <br>

However, I'm not hell-bent on that either -- when my first son was born it was like a man-fest at the hospital, lol.. the attending when I got there was a man, the only available nurse was a man, and then the OB on call was the only man at the practice where I go, lol.. Now I guess some might have gotten in a huff about it, but I did the best I could to have women and in an emergency situation you take what you can get and be happy, lol.<br>
<br>
If, god forbid, I or my husband was ever in a situation where we needed a lawyer for some Muslim-related case, I would certainly prefer a Muslim lawyer, or at least one who was well versed in Islam.  <br>
<br>
As Muslims we have such different lifestyle issues, there are things that a fellow Muslim would just automatically know that someone else may not.  In some cases it doesn't matter because you can discuss all relavent issues with whoever the provider is, but in others, where someone is representing your interests when you may not be present yourself, I'd be cautious about that.<br>

If you have a choice of hiring an attorney or a doctor or anyone else to provide you a service then you should be able to choose whomever you want using any criteria.  But if you are in a situation like a hospital where you cannot choose all of you caregivers, then you should leave your prejudices at home. No hospital or nursing home should allow it's patients to choose the race of their caregivers.  If they refuse to be treated by a caregiver of a sertain race, they should seek care elsewhere. By giving in to prejudices, we help to encourage them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tinlizzy@religiousdebate60574>TinLizzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#3333ff>(5/30/03 11:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=210.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Question</span><hr size=1> Kate,<br>
<br>
Your post reminded me about something I read on your board that I was curious about.  There was a thread about how Muslim men are prohibited from touching a woman who is not in his immediate family.  I believe a non-Muslim was asking about this after she saw a psychiatrist and he told her he could not shake her hand for religious reasons.  That made me wonder, is a Muslim male doctor not allowed to have female patients?  Wouldn't that mean there are no male Muslim OB's, or are there exemptions in certain areas?  Just curious.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
