I didn't know people still belonged to the Church of Satan. <br>
<br>
From the Temple site:<br>
<br>
&quot;Objective understanding and evaluation of the host society's values are necessary in order to intelligently formulate one's own. In Western conventional religions such independence is called &quot;Satanism&quot;. [It was in a 1960's antinomian experiment, the Church of Satan, that contemporary principles foreshadowing the Temple of Set were explored and evaluated, resulting in the more sophisticated formulation of the Temple of Set in 1975. We remain the only legally recognized &quot;Satanic&quot; institution in the world.] But the Initiate is rebelling against more than the idea of an external &quot;god&quot;: In secular life he seeks freedom from such external controlling forces as propaganda, custom, and habit as well. &quot;<br>
<br>
I always find this amusing:<br>
<br>
&quot;The Temple of Set evaluates conventional religions as erroneous in principle and therefore unworthy of peer status. We feel no need to concern ourselves with their activities, nor for that matter to maintain any sort of &quot;diplomatic relations&quot; with them [as in councils of churches]. Our position is that they may serve a useful social function as purveyors of soothing myths and fantasies to humans unable to attain Setian levels of self-consciousness. Hence we ignore conventional religious organizations unless they intrude upon our affairs.&quot;<br>
<br>
A lot of people call atheists arrogant. Trust me, members of the Temple REALLY are. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I think the message of the parable of Adam and Eve is about the relationship between parents and children, those in authority and subordinates, etc. Your comment that Christian belief is that man is &quot;inherently sinful&quot; I think is mistakenly translated into &quot;inherently evil.&quot; Do I think my child is evil if she disobeys? No. But, does she make all the decisions about her life? Or, do I let her suffer the consequences to teach her? No, not always. I teach her. Does she decide what is right for the family and me? I think you can see where I am going with this. I am responsible for guiding my children...and if there is a God, an if He loves us, I think one way of teaching us to have us look at ourselves in the fashion of the Adam and Eve story. I think the story is instructive of human nature - look at the title of Salmon Rushdie's new book, Cross That Line...<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think that the willfulness displayed by people throughout history even to the point of self-destruction confirms this notion. If some fundamentalist wacko believes that he is inherently evil and paying for someone else's sin, I think he is already in hell. And if he is insisting that you believe as he does then he obviously has not learned the lesson contained in the Adam and Eve story.<br>
<br>
Can something in the Bible be true even if it never really happened? The story of the Prodigal Son is a great story. Is it any less so if Jesus was not talking about someone he actually knew? I don't think so. Therefore, the message of the Adam and Eve story does not rest on whether Adam and Eve actually existed, but on the message.<br>
<br>
By the way I am a PRACTICING Catholic. I would not presume to tell someone else how to live their faith, or lack of faith for that matter. I am not in that league. This is some of how I see this issue.<br>

- I still have to respectfully disagree.  It we are natural born atheists, why have almost (if not every)every group of people/culture, even those on the islands of the sea or in deepest jungle, have God based philosophy.<br>
<br>
Also, just on a personal note, a toddler 16-18 months old that I met in Costa Rica saw a picture of Jesus that I had and immediately grabbed it away from me, gave it dozen kisses and said over and over JeeJee JeeJee.  This family lived in a one room shack, and did not attend any church.  The child just 'recognized' Him.  I dont buy that children are natural born atheists.<br>
<br>
You also said there are no miracles that occur today and that God isnt talking to anyone? - Sorry, I have personally had miracles in my life and the life of my family.  One such example was my dh met a woman in CA while on his mission.  This woman had had a brain aneurysm and had the mental capabilty of a child.  He and the other missionary that were with him gave her a blessing and she was Miraculously cured.  Her brain function returned to normal.  Faith alone isnt going to rebuild brain pathways - I know enough about medicine to know that brain cells just dont repair themselves instantaneously. Someone else (God) had a hand in it.<br>

God currently 'speaks' to a prophet and his name is Gordon B Hinkley.  To find out what he is saying you can check out this link:<br>

I have to disagree with this statement.  If one of my children were to &quot;find a god&quot; - I wouldn't be worried.  If they were happy...they had done it of their own accord, without coercion, or pressure, and they didn't want to force it on me - why would it bother me?<br>
<br>

First of all, humans, by being human, will share common tendencies.  We are pattern seeking, story telling creatures.  If we don’t know an answer we ask someone wiser.  If that wiser person spouts out a BS answer and we don’t test it ourselves, it can become treated as fact.  Just because a naturally superstitious creature spread across the planet naturally developed superstitions is no cause for it being true.  See the flat earth argument, the numbers fallacy or bandwagon one in other threads.  What you gloss over is that all over the planet, they developed <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>CONFLICTING</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> theologies.  This is not in support of your position, this undermines it.  Were there a revealed god, then they would all be the same faith.  You convincing Heather (Mom luvs em) that you are saved and she is wrong is more likely than you selling the fallacy of numbers here.  As stated previously, religion is a mechanism for controlling a population.  Tell the sheeple they are working on orders from god and they fall in line.  You find religions across the world for the same reason you find sexism across the world.  It is an effective means of control.  It is indoctrinated in the very young, it is punishable to question and ther leaders enjoy its support.  How else could we get such a moron as Dubya in office?<br>

Lovely anecdote, still totally lacking in evidentiary support.  Where is a medical report by separate physicians indicating the degree of her limitation?  What other elements were at play in the healing?  Was she being treated by anyone else?  Where is the report indicating how much of a recovery she made or how long it lasted?  What are the comparable rates of recidivism for her injury in the population at large?  Extraordinary claims require extensive evidence.  The child saying jeejee is wholly unremarkable given the extent of xian influence in a country like costa rica.  You were missionaries witnessing to them, how unlikely is it that this kid had seen a picture, since it hangs in just about every other home there?  Did none of his relatives ever visit?  No doubt they could just as easily have introduced him and begun his programming.  By not bothering to investigate these 'miracles' you are being irresponsible in your work for god.  You could be crediting the work improperly to him (Stealing, bearing false witness) or dropping the final proof of his existance and the worlds salvation into the toilet, costing him innumerable souls (please don't take this as an opportunity to explain why it may or may not apply to LDS, I don't care.  They are all myths, even yours. I am only interested in proof.)<br>

I really wouldn’t care so long as they were healthy in its pursuit.  Pull out a wooden spoon on my grandkids and we have an issue.  Have a man tell my daughter her ‘place’ or lay a finger on her in anger and he has a real big issue.  I raise my kids to question everything and learn to evaluate what is true or not.  They can then draw their own conclusions.  This is a difference between teaching and indoctrinating.  Similar to the man and the fishes story.  Teach a kid how to think and they are prepared for life, teach them what to think and you’ve only programmed them.  I don’t want them to take anything just because someone said so.  Even from me.  If they don’t buy it, challenge me.  We can then go through all the steps of inquiry and reason and they can arrive at their own conclusions.<br>
<br>
Oddly enough, my daughter’s school is hosted by a church.  My wife is on the christian education board and I run their books.  We are acknowledged atheists and they don’t seem to have a problem with us.  They want me to join the choir.  My daughter occasionally goes to Sunday school because her friends do and she wants to join them.  She is armed with a critical eye and well-developed sense of logic.  She is also respectful enough not to tell people they are wrong, and the teachers know that if they challenge her she will respond in a way they may not want.  Mutual respect and tolerance.<br>

this is perfectly stated and how i choose to raise my kids also.<br>
<br>
showing off simple scientific truths like rolling a ball down a ramp (how to think like the human race) that i have already come to accept with my son can be great bonding moments.<br>
<br>
you may disagree with me teaching my kids how to also feel and recognize the spirit (how to think for himself) so that he does not have to take my word for anything.<br>

i too have a friend who received a preisthood blessing and grew a new baby lung in place of a flat crispy black one (one of his lungs had collapsed doing a fire breathing act that went bad)  there are &quot;stories&quot; like this all over the place, i know, but you must realize that it should be equally hard for you to convince them that there isn't someone higher who already understands all of objective reality and loves them.<br>
<br>
my friend was an atheist son living out on his own when he had that experience.  his dad gave him a blessing while he was on life support and after the doctors had already taken pictures of his flattened lung.  the following day the new smaller lung was in it's place.<br>
<br>
i am 100% convinced that there is an objective way to explain what happened.  but since we aren't in the position to do so at the moment (at least the doctors weren't) i am fine relying upon someone else that already knows how to objectively explain it all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67@religiousdebate60574>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Convicted Skeptic</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/8/03 11:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: dag</span><hr size=1> Dag - you just don't get it.

Critical thinking skills is not the human race as seen in rolling a ball down the stairs.  Son of sam listened to the spirit.  So did Torquemada, Hitler, and Osama lots of people listen to the spirit.  Raise your son in their image, we can only hope he falls short of their mark.<br>

You cite miracle upon miracle, yet although you make it sound as common an occurance as shoe tying, no one has been able to document these anywhere.  They stand up so long as they are not examined.  Just because 95% of the killings in NY are explained by the cops and criminals are caught does not mean that the secret satanic cult is sacrificing the other 5%, or that aliens are experimenting on them, or vampires feeding off them.  Your 'God of the Gaps' does not fill in the vacancies or incompleteness of our record.  Science and reason will eventually supplant him in these spaces as it has done for 2000 years.  Eventually, he can go the way of the bean god and we can all grow up. <p>DBC67<br>

Throughout many of these posts you cited me as the most patient.  You exhausted that patience.  <br>

If you have better things to do with your time than waste it here, by all means, move on.  You can live your life unexamined and continue exploring your feelings, waiting for the rest of us to validate them.  I don’t really need to know “where [you] are comming from” beyond that you worship an unsubstantiated god.  How lovely the mythology happens to be is irrelevant to me, it is still mythology.<br>
<br>
I respect people like Candy and Shirene who will go toe-to-toe 9 rounds of courteous debate and argument, each testing my reason and logic, but not my patience.  I have immense respect for many of the caring and loving parents who do what they feel is best for their children.  I respect and admire the people, I do not respect or admire the theology that has them in its grasp.  Those people are the musicians who play piano because the music is beautiful, religion is the thug who will break their legs if they don’t play.  Close your eyes to millennia of rape, oppression, destruction and murder, I prefer to work to keep it from happening again. The saddest part is that these wonderful people, these beautiful musicians, feel they need this ugly thug to be the wonderful beings they are.  They cannot imagine life without him.<br>

DBC, I have stayed away from this thread because it's between you and dag.  I've ignored the insults etc, but this one was tough to ignore.  You're talking about an 18 month old little boy.  Surely, you've seen the wonder in a childs eyes when they figure something out for the first time.  (everytime I let go of this ball, it rolls down!)  That's the bonding that dag was talking about.  I fully respect your choice to raise your children with reason, etc.  Is it wrong to expect that same respect in return?  My ds is being raised with reason along with faith.  It's different, not wrong, just different than your choice.  Comparing him to people like Hitler and Osama is completely unnecessary.  Sorry to get worked up...but that's my baby you're talking about.<br>

On the miracles thing. Yep, I do think it is as common as tying your shoes. Most people have the faith and arent all tight about documenting it to prove God to those who wont buy it anyway.  Dh  and the woman who was healed know what happened.  ( And just for the record,- It is a medical fact that people dont just spontaneous heal from major brain damage -- I work in the field of geriatrics, specifically teaching caregivers about Dementia, Alzheimer's and other brain disease, so I know my stuff on this one.)<br>
<br>
Im sure there are medical records that show the extent of damage to this woman had, but this was 15 years ago and I dont keep that kind of thing handy.  You probably think wow if something like this happened it should have been lookd into, documented.  Most people of faith dont think that way.  We see it as part of life and as beautiful gifts from God, not an oddity that should be disected.  <br>
<br>
On the Aliens, I buy into the idea that we are not alone in the universe and who knows they may be visiting us.<br>
<br>
Elvis, there are enough people in the world who have similar looks (celebrity look alike good example) that yeah those people probably did see someone who looked enough like Elvis that they were convinced it was him.<br>
<br>
Everything else just feels like a never ending circle of he said she said. On these particulars (faith miracles etc.) I think I've rode the merry go around as far as I would like to, but thanks for playing  - - Shirene<br>

This is a more modern notion of miracles I think (later 20th C) and not shared by all faiths. When I was raised Catholic we I don't remember miracles being portrayes as common or frequent...else why would they be special and miraculous in the first place? If the laws of physics are constantly twisted and subverted the word miracle needs to redefined.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Most people have the faith and arent all tight about documenting it to prove God to those who wont buy it anyway.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Perhaps, but then why bring it up or pretend it is in any way proof? All too often religious folk DO expect anecdotes about revelation, conversion or healing to suffice--check out the millions that fraud who travels around pretending to heal folks (Dateline just ran another special on him). He supposedly heals and has follow ups and medical checks and blah, blah, but guess what? It's all fake-even the think about the professional boxer was not valid and plenty of poor, disabled and dying folk are bilked out of their money meanwhile. Not saying that's what your dh did--but if these personal experiences are not expected to influence or convince why are they perpetuated like so much urban mythology?<br>

I am certain they think they know what happened, but did dh visit with and review the medical records of the woman with her physicians prior to the &quot;blessing&quot; or &quot;healing&quot;? This is often what happens in healing cases--the &quot;healed&quot; person was either misdiagnosed initially, had conflicting diagnoses or misrepresents to the healer the illness.<br>
Oh--and yes, noone here supposed Alzheimer's is something you can spontaneously cure, but then we don't already know it all do we, for we are not gods?<br>

Perhaps, but it seems nooone saw them up front to verify her conditioninitially so you don't know anything was healed. If she was ill, there is proof she was somewhere...maybe you can't produce it, but then that's what puts this in the &quot;fish that got away&quot; and &quot;bigfoot&quot; category. I respect your right to self delusion, but don't acknowledge these stories are proof of anything...why mention them if you don't think we will buy into them?<br>

Perhaps, but then that is saying that this is part of the blind acceptance and surrender of the intellect to which DBC refers. You could be right, but then being a skeptic (and I could be projecting my responses onto the faithful, which would be admittedly foolish) I would WANT such proof to help skeptics and non-believers convert. I would want hard data the same way I would want test results on a biopsy before agreeing to chemo or surgery. If your religion is more important than your physical body, why such lower standard of proof for it?<br>
<br>
ST <p>&quot;I don't have any evidence of that... Just in terms of allocation of time resources, <br>
religion is not very efficient.  There's alot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.&quot; <br>
