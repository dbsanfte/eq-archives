The fans definetly saw a great show tonight, with the eWo Heavyweight Title Match set for Spring Stampede, with The Rock, Rob Van Dam, and Primetime Elix Skiper battling it out in a match. We also saw a brand new eWo Hardcore Champion, along with a brand new eWo United States Champion. Jonathon Coachman is walking around backstage, talking to some of the eWo superstars about tonights show, getting their responses. The camera pans in on Coach*<br><br>Coach:...And that was Rob Van Dam, who had a great night tonight, defeating Jeff Hardy in a tremendous ladder match to advance to Spring Stampede. And what a night it is shaping up to be. We expect to get a word from more eWo stars, as well, we plan on getting a word with eWo co-owner, Shane O Mac himself, who had quite a ruff night to say the least.<br><br>*The night goes on, as Coach continues to talk with other stars such as The Rock, Jeff Hardy, and Primetime. Coach is then going to get a cup of coffee when he sees Shane McMahon step out of his office with an ice pack taped on his shoulder. Coach runs up to Shane*<br><br>Coach: Shane, if I may, can I ask you a few questions about tonights Nitro?<br><br>Shane: Really Coach, Im not in the mood to talk.<br><br>Coach: Shane, please.<br><br>Shane: Make it quick. <br><br>Coach: Ok..first off..how is your arm?<br><br>Shane: How is my arm? How is my arm?!?! How in the hell do you think my arm is man?! I got speared into the damn turnbuckle by that big bastard Dr Death. How do you think i feel huh?! It hurts like hell! It feels like a big 18 wheeler came crashing into me. Thats how it feels.<br><br>Coach: Well..Shane..uhmm..<br> <br>Shane: You know Coach..I came here tonight..a happy man. The eWo was firmly in mine and Eric's hands. When we arrived in Raliegh, I thought that this was going to a perfect tonight. And what happens..the big surprise of the night..Mick Foley returning as the eWo Commish..and the son of a.....the man stabs me in the back.<br><br>Coach: Well, lets talk about that a little bit. I mean, when you made ur announcement, you seemed pleased. But when you found out about Foley's agreement with your mom, Linda, and his surprise for Eric Bischoff...<br><br>Shane: Stop right there Coach. Do you think I didn't expect Foley to stab me in the back? Hell...I could have bet money on Foley screwing me over. And that is exactly what that freak did to Eric and I. Mick Foley...you may have screwed us over..yes..but this isn't even close to being over. What you did might have given you self-satisfaction, thinking that you just came from under our noses and took over the business...and quite frankly, I hope you do feel that way. I hope you do call home tonight, and speak with your wife, Collette, and your children, Dewey and Noelle, and rejoice with them about how you single handedly took over the eWo...because you know what Mick? Your rejoicing period..is on short notice. Oh yeah Mick, live it up! Live life to the fullest, go give yourself a pay raise and take your kids to a damn water park or something, because when we get done with you...you wont have any money left to blow it at some amusement park. You wont have any money to buy your kids their favorite toys, or your wife that necklace during the holidays..no Mick..you will be too busy fighting to keep your family and yourself out of the damn gutter. And Mick, you will be crawling back to us. You will be on your hands and knees begging to get a job back..and being the nice guys that we are..we would let you work on ring crew...or maybe as a janitor..or hell, maybe you can have Coach's job as an announcer. Whatever the case may be...just keep it in mind Foley. Your days as eWo owner are definetly numbered, and the number is DAMN low.<br><br>Coach: Wow...thats deep words there Shane. Can you shed some light on how you are going to get back at Foley?<br><br>Shane: Dont you worry about that Coach. Eric and I have many plans on how to get back at him. Hell, we started this damn company, we brought it back from the dead..we are going to fight for it. Every drop of blood and sweat will be poured from our bodies, all in an effort to get the eWo back to where it belongs. <br><br>Coach: About Spring Stampede, your partner, Eric Bischoff, has to go one on one with the returning eWo legend, Dr. Death, and both you and Mick Foley will be special referees....and this match will be in a Triple Cage Match. How do you feel about that?<br><br>Shane: You know Foley, you might think you have pulled a fast one on us. Well, first off, let me say this. Bisch WILL compete in this match, and I WILL be there as a referee to make sure everything goes down the right way. But Mick, you dont know what your doing man..can you really trust Dr Death? I was in the eWo back when Dr Death was at his prime..and he was the one man you couldn't trust. He was the one man that would stab you in the back so fast, you wouldnt know what happened. So just keep that in mind Foley..you might not wanna turn your back on the Oklahomian. But Doc...let me make one thing perfectly clear. What you did to me tonight, and what you did to Eric tonight..it will not go unpunished. Oh yeah..as co owner of the eWo, i hear by fine you 5 thousand dollars..and Dr Death, if you so much as lay one finger..ONE FINGER..on me during your match at Spring Stampede..your ass is fired, along with your fat ass broadcaster, good ole JR. <br><br>Coach: A huge announcement from Shane McMahon! Dr Death has been fined 5 G's, and if he so much as touches Shane in their match at Spring Stampede..well..lets just see he will have the shortest comeback career in eWo history!<br><br>Shane: Well done Coach. When Foley comes crawling back looking for a job, he sure wont get yours.<br><br>Coach: Well thank you..I..<br><br>Shane: Im not here to chat Coach. Are you done?<br><br>Coach: Two more question Shane. I would like to get your comments on how you feel towards your mother, Linda McMahon and how she signed Mick Foley to be full owner.<br><br>Shane: Ahhh yes...ole mother. That lady seems to always put her damn nose in my business! All the way back when I was a little baby putting a jigsaw puzzle together...you know Coach, how when you are just finishing up with a 10000 piece puzzle..there is just one piece left..and you cant wait to put it in?<br><br>Coach: Well..yeah..<br><br>Shane: Well my mom would be the one to stick her damn nose in the way and put that last piece in. She has always been there to screw with my life. And it continues tonight, with my mom signing Mick. But you know what, it was just like her to screw up. You see mom, you failed to A. realize something, and B. accomplish something, during this contract signing of Mick Foley. And this mistake of yours is going to come back and bite both you and Mick right on the ass! And I am going to show you exactly what it is at Spring Stampede. But mom, I do have to thank you for something. You left me with a great analogy....just like you, Lifes a bitch!<br><br>Coach: Shane..its your own mom...<br><br>Shane: No its not. Shes not my mother anymore. Like I just said, shes nothing more than a snot nosed, two timing, back stabbing Bitch! And at Spring Stampede..my surprise for Linda and Mick is going to change the eWo for good!<br><br>Coach: Ok....well...changing gears a bit. We have narrowed down the EWO Title Tourny to three men, The Rock, Rob Van Dam, and Primetime Elix Skiper. Can I get your thoughts about this final match at Spring Stampede..which should be a great contest..<br><br>Shane: Yes...big congrats go out to Rock, RVD and Skip. I wish you all the best of luck at Spring Stampede..and this friday night on eWo 2 Night, the stipulation will be named for that match. And also, congratulations go out to Big Show and Vampiro for their title gains tonight.<br><br>Coach: Alright Shane, again, thanks alot for joining me tonight. I know you're gonna be busy, heading out to Charlotte over the week and getting the Charlotte Coliseum ready for eWo 2 Night, which will be on friday night. <br><br>Shane: Yep..and I'll be at Charlotte that night, along with Mr. Bischoff to make sure order is stored. <br><br>Coach: Alright, and Ill be in Sacto as usual friday night, LIVE from the eWo studios talking about all the action going around in the eWo. Thanks again for your time Shane, and I hope your shoulder feels better.<br><br>Shane: You better be hoping that Foley will be better after we get through with him. <br><br>*Shane walks through a door and the camera shows him stepping into a limo as it drives away.*<br><br>Coach: Wow..never a dull moment when you talk to eWo co-owner Shane McMahon...Well, upnext, I'm gonna get a word with Jerry The King Lawler...we'll be right back!<br><br>*The camera goes black* <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=26.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=26.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=26.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.threadControl?topicID=26.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ewo80708frm1">eWo RP Board<option value="ewo80708frm2">eWo OOC Board<option value="ewo80708frm3">eWo Nitro<option value="ewo80708frm4">eWo 2 NighT</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bewo80708>eWo</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1>eWo RP Board</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
