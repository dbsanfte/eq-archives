<br>
Ayslyn sat back and grinned.  “Let me tell you all about Rose,” he said with a laugh.<br>
<br>
***** <br>
<br>
The three companions rode north and east through the plains.  Ayslyn sat forlornly on his destrier.  Alec looked at him contemptuously for a moment before stating, “Oh stop sulking.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn sighed and looked at his friend.   “Why the Tomb of Swords though?  Couldn’t you have found a Tomb of Bows?”<br>
<br>
Alec rolled his eyes and continued to ignore his friend.  Terrellion looked back and forth between them.  “Cheer up Ays.  This’ll be fun.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn glared at him for a moment before returning to his sulk.  After a few minutes he spoke up.  “It’s just that we find every other magical weapon in creation except bows.  Magic swords, magic sticks,”<br>
<br>
Alec looked at him dangerously, “Miranda’s friend explained that to you.  That was a Staff of the magi.  And you almost snapped it in half you nit.”<br>
<br>
“How was I supposed to know?  It looked like a stick to me.  Anyway, we even found a damned magical scythe.  But, the only magical bow around here is the one I had made.”<br>
<br>
Alec looked at him for a few moments before replying, “Maybe if you’re lucky, one of the adventurers in there was an archer.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn brightened up immediately.  “Ya think so?”<br>
<br>
Alec looked at him, surprised.  “Um….   Sure,” he shrugged.<br>
<br>
Ayslyn grinned happily and nudged his horse into a quick run.  Alec shook his head in wonderment.  “That boy is strange.” He grinned<br>

They were recessed into the cliff side, and solid stone.  Ayslyn leaned casually against the cliff.  “Alright, so we’ve found the Tomb of Swords,” he paused and looked at his friends.  “Now what?”<br>
<br>
Terrellion scratched his chin, thoughtfully.  “Um…  We open the doors and go in?”<br>
<br>
“Brilliant Terr…  Now, how do we do that?”<br>
<br>
“You’re the wood elf.  Push em open.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn contemplated the pair of thirty-foot high doors dubiously.  “I could try, but I doubt even I could budge them.  Alec, you got any ideas?”<br>
<br>
The mage looked up from his book.  “Yeah, I think I might be able to help you open the doors.”  He mouthed a few words from his book, memorizing the spell, and nodded briskly.  “Alright, I’m ready.  Go ahead Ays.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn nodded and unstrung his bow.  He wrapped the string carefully around it and slid it into his enchanted quiver.  Rolling his shoulders to loosen the muscles, he cracked his knuckles and took up position in front of the door.  Behind him, he heard Alec begin to chant.  Leaning forward slightly, he put his shoulder and hand against the door and pushed.  His trailing foot slid a little in the dirt before finding purchase.  Tight, corded muscles in his arms, back and legs contracted as Ayslyn brought all of his considerable strength to bear on the door.  Alec finished the spell and thrust his hand out in front of him, palm out.  A glowing hand taller than Ayslyn himself appeared above the ranger.  Slowly the door began to groan and creak as ancient hinges were forced into use.  The door swung open slowly.  Ayslyn shifted his weight, and began to step forward, step after step, forcing the door open.  The muscles in Ayslyn’s shoulders and legs began to burn with the strain.  He tightened his focus, ignoring everything but taking step after agonizing step.  The sudden touch of someone’s hand on his back shocked him.  Spinning, he almost lost his balance as the ignored strain on his body demanded strict attention.  He leaned heavily on the now open door, and slid carefully down to the ground, panting.  <br>
<br>
Alec handed him a flask.  “Drink this.  Esme left us a few potions for while she was away.  Seems she knew we wouldn’t wait for her to get back before heading out.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn nodded, exhausted and drank down the contents of the flask.  Honey sweet, he swallowed the potion and smiled as it’s healing warmth flowed over him, washing away the tension, and exhaustion.  He stood, and made his way to his horse. Withdrawing a linen cloth from his saddle pack, he wiped the sweat from his face and arms.  “Those things could come in handy,” he remarked to the other two, as they prepared to enter the tomb.  He took his bow from the quiver and strung it, pulling back the string lightly to test the pull.  Nodding in satisfaction, he turned to the two they had hired to drive the wagon, and watch their horses while they explored the tomb.  He took a small bag from his packs and handed it over to them.  “Make sure to give Midnight a couple of apples.” He patted the horse’s neck affectionately.  Midnight whinnied and nodded.  Ayslyn chuckled and made his way to the open door of the tomb, drawing and nocking an arrow as he did.  “Alright lads, are we ready?”  His friends nodded.  “Lets head in then.”  He stepped into the darkness.<br>

The next part is starting to get rather long...  I think it is time to break it up some...  ))<br>
<br>
The interior of the tomb was dark.  Centuries had passed since anyone had been inside it, and why light someplace that no one living is likely to see.  Ayslyn’s eyes swiftly adapted to the darkness, and he slipped further into the tomb, ready to draw back his arrow at any sign of danger.  The hard clacking of their boots striking against the flagstones echoed down the corridor.  Ayslyn’s eyes flicked back and forth, looking for any side passages, and more importantly, any enemies.  “So,” he whispered back to his friends, “What can we expect?”<br>
<br>
Alec replied thoughtfully, “The adventuring company that is buried here consisted of a paladin, cleric, sorceress, and a pair of warriors.  They were moderately successful.  However, it doesn’t look as though the tomb has been opened before, so it should be empty.”<br>
<br>
A throat ripping, high pitched screech accompanied the wight as it charged out of a side room and swiped blackened, fouled claws at Ayslyn.  He threw himself backwards, away from the beast, pulling back the bowstring and letting fly the arrow he had nocked.  The arrow flew, straight and true, imbedding itself in the creature’s thigh.  The wight screeched in pain and glared hatefully at Ayslyn.  Terrellion stepped between them, sword and shield at the ready as Ayslyn tucked and rolled, landing sprawled against the wall, dazed.  He shook his head hard to clear it and leapt to his feet.  The Wight launched itself at Terrellion who calmly blocked it with his shield.  Hardened claws scraped at metal as Terrellion batted away the creature’s attacks.  He swung his sword up and under his shield.  Razor sharp steel met flesh as the blade sliced into the wight’s side.  He gripped his shield tight and rushed it, smashing it into the wall, and jumped back.  <br>
<br>
A keening wail from behind them tore Ayslyn’s attention from the fight before him.  A wraith had ghosted through the wall and reached for Alec.  The mage chanted softly and extended on hand.  A spread of crimson darts flew from his fingertips and struck the wraith hard.  Ayslyn drew an arrow and began firing into the creature as well.  Soon, with one final pitiful cry, it slumped to the ground.  They turned back in time to see Terrellion finish off the wight.  Ayslyn looked at Alec skeptically.  “Empty,” was all he said.<br>
<br>
Alec shrugged, “Course, I could be wrong,” he replied with a grin.  Ayslyn chuckled and motioned to the room that the two creatures had come from.  Within it, they found that the tombs of the cleric, and one of the warriors had been desecrated.  Ayslyn and Alec exchanged worried glances, but it was Terrellion that spoke up.<br>
<br>
“You don’t suppose that the two we just killed,” he pointed at the open and empty sarcophagi.<br>
<br>
Alec frowned.  “By all accounts that I could find, none of the members died at the hands of undead.  Miiria, the cleric, died in a rockslide, and Hadren, the warrior here, he died in a barfight.  There is nothing that would suggest that they would come back.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn tapped his chin thoughtfully.  “Maybe something ate the corpses.  There might be a ghoul about.  Or perhaps a ghast.”<br>
Alec nodded.  “Either way, we’ll need to explore a bit more.  Let’s go.”<br>
<br>
They left to room, and made their way further into the tomb.  After a few minutes, they reached the end of the corridor.  A single door led off to the right.  Stepping up to it, carefully, Ayslyn took hold of the handle and opened it, and stepped into the small room.  The remains of an altar filled to opposite wall of the room, and another door stood in the left hand wall.  Ayslyn knelt to examine the wreckage.  “Look at this.” He poked at the remains.  “This isn’t time, or an accident.”  He held up a piece of the table leg, pointing to the many cuts in it.  “We’re talking about pure malice here.  Someone had a serious mad on when they did this.”<br>
<br>
Alec slowly read the name above the door.  “Moritval.  That would be the paladin.”  He looked worriedly at Ayslyn.  <br>
<br>
Ayslyn shrugged, and tested the handle to the door.  “Locked,” he said.  He looked to Alec, who shook his head.  Shrugging again, he stepped back and kicked the door, just above the handle, hard.  Ancient wood and metal tore apart under the force of the blow, and the door flew open.  They entered the long room cautiously.  A sarcophagus stood atop a three-tiered dais at the end of the room, a large chandelier hanging above it.  A suit of ancient armour stood off to the side.  Even from here, they could tell that the sarcophagus was closed.  “Looks like Moritval is still sleeping soundly,” Ayslyn said as he approached the dais.<br>
<br>
Twin pinpricks of red-hot flame burst to life within the visor of the armour.  Alec shouted a warning as it snatched up its greatsword and swung at Ayslyn.  The magic within his bracers flowed through him and Ayslyn leapt high into the air.  He caught hold of the chandelier and swore.  “A deathknight?  What the hell is going on here?”<br>
<br>
The ancient armour creaked and groaned at the deathknight moved away from the wall.  Once again, Terrellion moved forward to intercept it.  Ayslyn locked his legs around the chandelier and swung forward to hang down.  He drew an arrow from his enchanted quiver.  Terrellion and the deathknight came together with a crash.  The deathknight swung its sword wide and crashed into Terrellion’s shield, sparks flying as metal raked against metal.  Terrellion’s knees buckled under the blow, but he kept his footing, and swung hard, catching it in the leg.<br>
<br>
Ayslyn drew back his bow, and sighted down the shaft.  He called out, “Left” and let fly.  Terrellion danced to the left just in time for the arrow to sail past him and lodge itself into the elbow joint of the armour.  He fired twice more, this time hitting the shoulder joint.  Alec was chanting furiously in the doorway.  He thrust his hands forward and a virulently green missile shot away from him.  It struck the deathknight in the chest, and a green liquid splattered over the armour.  Within seconds it began to hiss and smoke as the acid began to eat away at the armour.  Meanwhile, Terrellion had continued to hack and bash at it.  A savage blow to its knee caused its leg to collapse under it, and it crashed into the wall.  Ayslyn had a sudden idea.  “Head” he called out, drawing one of his special dragon-slaying arrows.  He nocked the solid steel shaft and drew back the string.  Quickly sighting down the shaft, he let fly.  The arrow streaked across the room to strike dead on target.  The helmet of the deathknight crumpled underneath it, the knight himself, slumped to the floor.  The twin points of light within the helmet flickered and vanished.<br>
<br>
Ayslyn dropped down from the chandelier, landing in a crouch.  As he straightened, he looked at each of his companions.  “Alright.  Now, that was definitely the paladin come back as a deathknight.  Someone want to venture a guess about why all these adventurers came back as undead?”<br>
<br>
Alec shrugged helplessly, “I haven’t a clue.  A paladin returning as a deathknight is a big deal, and doesn’t just happen.  Somebody deliberately did that to him.” He pointed to the pile of armour.<br>
<br>
“Guys,” Terrellion interrupted.  “We’re still missing two.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn looked about the room.  “And there are no more doors.  We’ve seen everything in this tomb, unless…”<br>
<br>
Alec and Terrellion nodded, agreeing.  Alec said, “Terr, you search this room, I’ll take the last one, and Ays, you check the other one.  Let’s see what we find.”<br>

<br>
Ayslyn nodded and made his way back to the other tomb.  Slowly he made his way around the perimeter of the room, carefully checking the walls.  As he reached the back wall, his ears twitched slightly.  He heard the soft whisper of wind, and felt it on his fingertips.  Feeling his way along the wall, he soon found the gap.  He carefully traced out the outline of the hidden door, and began to search for the opening mechanism.  Smiling as he felt one of the stones shift under his gentle probing, he pushed it, and the door slid into the floor.  “I found it,” he called out.  Within moments, he two companions were beside him.  “Ready?” he asked them.  They nodded in unison.  “Right then.  Off we go.”  He made his way into a short passage and down a steep flight of stairs, an arrow nocked and ready.<br>
<br>
The stairs ended in an archway.  Beyond it was a massive room, easily two hundred feet long, and half as wide.  Torches flared to life as they entered, momentarily blinding them.  Ayslyn squinted as his eyes adjusted.  A dais dominated the far end of the room, along with the sarcophagus atop it.  “Looks like this is number four,” he quipped as they cautiously made their way down the room.<br>
<br>
As they approached the halfway point, a massive cloud burst forth in front of them.  They reeled back from the stench of brimstone and death.  The smoke cleared, revealing what looked to be a ten-foot tall bear with massive curling ram horns.  It stood on its hind legs and regarded them malevolently.  “Return from whence you came and never return,” it bellowed at them.<br>
<br>
“Sweet Rhiannon,” Alec swore, “A guardian demon.  What in the nine hells is a guardian demon doing here?”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn drew back his bowstring and fired, “Less talk!  More fight!” he called out.  Terrellion moved forward to engage the beast as Ayslyn dashed to the side to flank it.  Alec shook his head and circled round the other side.  He began chanting.  Again, a spread of crimson missiles shot from his outstretched hands, sidling around Terrellion to strike the demon.  Ayslyn fired arrow after arrow into its back and Terrellion struck it from the front with his sword.  The demon roared in pain, but they didn’t relent.  Soon it drew a single shuddering breath, and fell to the ground.  “I guess they don’t make guardian demons like they used to,” Ayslyn grinned as he returned the arrow he had just drawn to his quiver.<br>
<br>
They looked down the length of the room, watching warily.  When nothing else appeared, they continued.  They mounted the dais, and looked down upon the sarcophagus.  “Anyone care to lay odds on what he’s become?” Ayslyn grinned.<br>
<br>
Alec chuckled and dusted off the nameplate.  “Nerram.  Yup, this was the leader of the group.”  He nodded, and Ayslyn handed him his bow.<br>
<br>
“Cover me, Terr,” Ayslyn asked as he moved to get a good grip on the lid.  He pushed, hard, and the lid shifted.  He kept at it, until finally, the lid toppled over and crashed to the floor.  Within the sarcophagus, lay Nerram’s remains, bedecked in armour and jewels, and holding a longsword.  Alec passed the bow back to Ayslyn, and they watched the remains carefully.  After a few moments, Ayslyn sighed.  “Alright, I’m confused.”  He spun round, and leaned against the sarcophagus.  “Anyone care to present a theory?”  He looked back and forth at his two friends.  “No?  What about the last one?  The sorceress?  Where is she?  There doesn’t seem to be another way out of this room.  What was her name?”<br>
<br>
“Curiously enough,” Alec replied, “I don’t know.  Each of the others were listed, but all that I could find about her was that she was a member of the company, she was human, and she was a sorceress.”<br>
<br>
“Right, then.  I guess we check the walls,” Ayslyn rubbed his hands together.  They split up and began to search the walls carefully.  Terrellion even checked the floor for trap doors.  After some time, they all returned to the dais.  Ayslyn frowned.  “Not a thing.  So, now what.”<br>
<br>
Alec and Terrellion both shrugged.  “We could try the rod,” Alec said hesitantly.<br>
<br>
Terrellion frowned.  “The last time we used that, you wound up with an apprentice with a penchant for Wild magic.”  Alec winced, remembering.<br>
<br>
Ayslyn shook his head.  “No, Terr, Alec is right.  I can’t think of anything else.  But first, we take all that stuff off him.  If he’s hostile, I don’t want him to have anything to attack us with.”  They nodded, and began to strip everything off the corpse.  Ayslyn held up the helm that it had.  On one side, a gruesome, snarl toothed face glared at him, but on the other, was a peaceful, smiling face.  He shrugged and tossed it on the growing pile of junk on the floor.<br>
<br>
Alec withdrew a slender, three-foot long rod from his pack.  “Alright then, ready?”  Ayslyn nocked an arrow and nodded along with Terrellion.  Alec gently touched Nerram’s remains and spoke a single word of power.  A brilliant flash of light burst from the tip of the rod, and was absorbed into the corpse.  <br>
<br>
Slowly at first, but steadily quickening, the corpse began to reconstitute.  Cartilage formed on the bones and joints, to be covered in thick ropey muscles.  Finally, skin covered all of that.  Nerram groaned aloud and slowly sat up.  Looking about, he noticed Ayslyn and Terrellion, weapons at the ready.  “Who are you people?” he asked, confused.  “Where am I?”<br>
<br>
“Seems friendly enough, for now,” Ayslyn remarked.  <br>
<br>
“We are a company of adventurers, as you were,” Alec began.<br>
<br>
“Were?”<br>
<br>
Alec cleared his throat.  “You’ve been dead for about fifteen centuries.  We were exploring your tomb, and found the others turned into undead.  There was a demon guarding you.”<br>
<br>
“That witch!” Nerram swore.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me?” Ayslyn asked, confused.<br>
<br>
“Rose!  That witch gave me an enchanted helmet.  After that, I had no control over my actions.  I was like a rider in my own body, with someone else holding the reigns.  Oh, gods.  Miiria.  I caused a rockslide to kill her.  And her husband, Hadren.  I knifed him in the back during a bar fight.”  He buried his face in his hands and began to weep.<br>
<br>
Ayslyn looked confused.  He reached down, and retrieved the helm.  “This helmet?  ‘s pretty ugly.  Why did you wear this?”<br>
<br>
Nerram shook his head, “That wasn’t it.  I’ve never seen it before.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn raised an eyebrow.  “You were wearing it when we found you.”<br>
<br>
Alec looked up in shock.  “Give me that,” he said, snatching the helmet away.  He sat down on the steps and began rummaging in his packs.  He withdrew a pearl, and holding it gingerly between his forefinger and his thumb, he began to chant.<br>
<br>
“What in the nine hells is he doing?” Nerram asked.  Ayslyn shrugged.<br>
<br>
After a moment, Alec stood triumphantly.  “I got it!” he exulted.  “The enchantment on this helm reverses your moral stance.  You were a force for good, so when you put this on -- I can only guess that she cast some sort of illusion on it – you turned to the forces of evil.  That is why you lost control of yourself.”<br>
<br>
Nerram swore heavily.  “If she wasn’t dead by now, I’d kill her.”<br>
<br>
“Why did you call her Rose?”  Ayslyn mused.<br>
<br>
“She had a rose tattooed on her breast.”<br>
<br>
“Good reason.”<br>
<br>
They led Nerram out of the tomb, and took him back to town with them.  They would hand him over to Miranda.  If anyone knew what it was like to wake up centuries out of their own time, she would.  Perhaps she would be able to help him adjust.<br>

<br>
Terrellion crumpled the scroll in his fist and swore.  Ayslyn looked up from his fletching curiously.  “What’s the matter Terr?”<br>
<br>
“It’s a letter from my family back on Evermeet.  There is trouble.”<br>
<br>
Alec sat in one of the chairs by the window, a glass of wine in one hand.  “What kind of trouble?”<br>
<br>
“Someone is out to steal our Moonblade.”<br>
<br>
Alec let out a long, low whistle, impressed.  “Your family has a Moonblade?  That would make you…”<br>
<br>
Terrellion nodded.  “That’s right.  Unfortunately ours was cursed long ago.  Any who touched it would be turned to darkness.  It’s been hidden away for centuries.  It seems as though some distant cousin of mine has taken it into his head to try to find it.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn looked back and forth between his two friends.  “Ummm,” he began, “What’s a Moonblade?”  The two other elves stared at him in shock.  Ayslyn looked behind him, trying to figure out what they were staring at.  “What?  What’s with the staring?”<br>
<br>
Alec cleared his throat.  “You’ve never heard of the Moonblades?  They’re famous Silver Elf artifacts.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn raised an eyebrow.  “Ah, hello…  I’m a Wood Elf.  How in the nine hells would I know about them?  My Silver Elf history is a little rusty.”<br>
<br>
Terrellion sighed.  “The Moonblades are powerful enchanted swords that are given to the noble families of my people.  Each of them had different abilities.  The records of what ours was capable of are lost.  With the Moonblade effectively lost to us, no one felt it necessary to keep track of what it could do.  Only a member of the family who owned it can even touch them.  It is death for any others.  Anyway, I need to go to Evermeet and try to stop him.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn bounced up from his seat.  “We’ll go with you.  We can help.”<br>
<br>
Terrellion looked dubiously at Ayslyn for a few moments.  “You might not be well received there.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn grinned.  “I’m not all that well received here either.  I’ll deal.”<br>
<br>
Terrellion smiled.  “Thank you my friend.  I will be glad to have you both at my side.”<br>

<br>
The trip to Evermeet was easy.  Many of the elven cities were connect with mystic portals.  Step into one here in Evereska, and you would step out another, leagues distant, as though you had just stepped from one room to another.  But still, it came as some surprise to Ayslyn that the portal from Evereska to Evermeet was located in the temple of Hanalli, the goddess of love and beauty.  Ayslyn stared about at a crowd of Hanalli’s priestesses.  A tall Gold Elf, long platinum hair flowing down her back, smiled at him. “Guys,” he remarked, “We’re not in that much of a hurry, are we?”<br>
<br>
Alec looked thoughtful, considering the idea.  Terrellion frowned.  “We don’t have the time.”  Ayslyn sighed, but dutifully followed his friends back to the portal, waving farewell to the lovely elven women.  <br>
<br>
As they reached the back of the temple, Ayslyn eyed the glowing archway, hidden behind the statue of Hanalli, dubiously.  “So, we step through that, and we’ll be there?” he asked, not quite convinced it could be that simple.<br>
<br>
The head priestess, whom had aged exceptionally well, even for an elf, smiled gently at him.  “Put your concerns aside good ranger.  Place your faith in the gods.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn almost frowned, but caught himself in time.  They had, some years previous, stopped some slime god from bringing his avatar into the world in the tunnels and caverns of the Underdark, and after that incident in the Forest of Wyrms, and what Alec had done to the Zentrim, well, they seemed to be angering a number of dieties.  Ayslyn figured that they really couldn’t afford to alienate any of their own.  He smiled, obligingly, and followed Terrellion and Alec into the portal, giving the blonde priestess one last wink before he vanished.<br>
<br>
Warm sun fell on his face, and the scents of freshly tended lawns washed over him.  He looked about him wonderingly at the massive garden they had stepped into.  Carefully tended, and shaped trees lined the harmoniously ordered rows.  Delicately balanced beds of flowers artfully sprawled in rows that were rigidly arranged to look casual.  He breathed deeply, but the delicate blends of perfumes from the flowers seemed artificial to him.  Here was only sweetness and light.  None of the earthier scents that were found in true nature were to be found here.  Here, nature was tamed to their own ideal.  Silver Elves, he decided, would just never get it.<br>
<br>
He followed Alec and Terrellion down a straight path towards the exit from the garden.  A pair of guards stood attention at the vine-covered archway.  They waved Terrellion and Alec through.  Glaring at Ayslyn, they began to wave him through as well.  Ayslyn grinned, impishly, and stuck his thumbs in his belt.  Leaning back slightly, he sauntered past them.  “Afternoon boys.  How’re y’all doin’?” he drawled, allowing all of the thick Moonshae’s accent, that he had lost over the years since he had left, flow back into his speech.  The guard on the left gasped, while the other just sneered at him.  Ayslyn just grinned wider, and winked as he continued after his friends.<br>

His unlit pipe dangled loosely in his hand.  He wasn’t quite brooding, after all there wasn’t really anything for him to brood over, but he was starting to begin wondering if his coming here had been a good idea.  Terrellion’s family hadn’t been thrilled with his choice of companion, but they had still welcomed Ayslyn into their home.  He could almost hear them thinking, “Well, at least he’s not consorting with humans.”   Truly, it didn’t really bother him much, but dealing with a bevy of Silver Elves constantly, and very pointedly not looking down their noses at him was rapidly becoming wearying.<br>
<br>
Alec made his was over to his friend, and handed him a tinder lit from the fireplace.  Ayslyn smiled at him and slowly lit his pipe, taking a few experimental puffs from it.  “Copper for your thoughts Ays?” Alec offered.<br>
<br>
“You’d be drastically overpaying,” Ayslyn quipped back.  He sighed softly as he pushed the window open slightly to let the smoke out.  “It’s nothing really.  I guess that I am just feeling out of sorts.”<br>
<br>
Alec nodded, understanding.  “As soon as Terr’s family gives him all the details, we will get out of here.”  He grinned and continued, “Then you can get back to being a good little savage.”  <br>
<br>
He danced out of the way as Ayslyn punched him lightly.  “Get lost ya scrawny bookworm,” he retorted with a wink.  Alec laughed.  <br>
<br>
The double doors leading into the sitting room flew open and Terrellion strode in to join them.  He grinned and held up a scroll tube.  “We’ve got it.”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn and Alec looked at each other and grinned along with him.<br>
<br>
“Well then,” Ayslyn said as he rose and tapped his pipe out into the fire.  “What are we waiting for?  Lets go get ourselves a cursed sword.”<br>

Renting rooms from the innkeeper of the Golden Mug they sat down in the common room to formulate a plan.  Terrellion told them everything that his family had told him about his wayward cousin.  “His name is Mourvian, and he has been obsessed with power for a long time.  Nothing that our family has satisfied him so he joined a group of adventurers.  He’s always been a rotten, conniving bastard.  It seems though, that time has made things worse.  His ‘friends’ are the worst sort imaginable.”  He spread several sketches out on the table.  <br>
<br>
Ayslyn took one of them and pondered it.  A young woman stared back at him from the paper.  Something about it tugged insistently at his memory, but he couldn’t place it.  He was about to put it back down when a voice behind him demanded, “Where the hell did you get that?”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn turned round, surprised, and looked up at Nerram.  “What are you doing here?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“Answer my question.  How did you get a picture of Rose?”<br>
<br>
Ayslyn snapped his fingers as it came to him.  He looked closely at the sketch.  There it was, the rose tattoo peeking up over the low neck of her bodice.  His head whipped about as he stared at Nerram in shock.  “Ummm…  This is a sketch of someone seen with one of Terr’s cousins.  Are you sure it’s her?”<br>
<br>
Nerram looked at Ayslyn with contempt.  “You think that I would forget her?”<br>
<br>
“Well then, how the hell is she still around, and looking pretty young at that?”<br>
<br>
“How am I supposed to know?  But THAT is Rose!”  Nerram was practically frothing at the mouth now.  <br>
<br>
“All right, all right.  It’s Rose.  Relax.”  Ayslyn nodded slightly at Alec.<br>
<br>
“Don’t tell me to relax!  That woman ruin,” Nerram began.  Looking at Alec, his eyes rolled up slowly and he dropped to the ground, fast asleep.  <br>
<br>
Alec grinned and brushed sand from his hands.  “Love that spell.”  Ayslyn chuckled back and nodded.  Entrusting the fighter to the innkeeper, they set out for the resting place for the moonblade.<br>
