Summary: mushy valentines crap.<br>
Disclaimer: I don’t own any of Andromeda, but I can still make them do what I want.   Look, I can make them all dance……*Rev and Harper do a Magog happy dance.*<br>
<br>
Ok people, I REALLY wanted to write a valentines day lovey dovey thing but to be honest, I couldn’t think of any good ideas. This was the only one that presented itself to me, so I did the best I could. It went a little screwy because I made the mistake of reading a bit of a Lord of the Rings book sometime in the middle, and it affected my thinking for a bit. Anyway, don’t complain if it’s a bit disjointed and it’s not that good, it’s Valentine’s Day, its love. It’s ALL GOOD.<br>
<br>
Part 1<br>
Harper laid back in his small cot on the Maru and closed his eyes, letting his mind run over everything that had happened that day. To be honest, he hadn’t ever heard of Valentines Day before a week or so ago. Coming from Earth, there wasn’t a whole lot of love to go around and they weren’t gonna celebrate the fact, so Valentines Day had been forgotten over the centuries. Dylan, however, coming from the old Commonwealth had remembered the holiday and mentioned it to Harper.<br>
<br>
Being the suave, debonair man of the universe that he was, he immediately set to work preparing a special dinner for him and the object of his affections. He would finally have the perfect time to tell her exactly how he felt and he even managed to come up with a suitable present for the occasion. Harper spent several days planning the special evening, even letting Rommie in on it as he needed to look up details in her database.<br>
<br>
He had spent several nights slaving in the kitchens, trying to whip up a fantastic meal complete with champagne and flowers fresh from hydroponics. Again, with his background he didn’t really have a lot of experience with cooking, but he prided himself on being a fairly fast learner and had managed, with Andromeda’s help, to cook up a reasonable meal<br>
<br>
Then of course, as always seems to happen, they were attacked. Although the Andromeda had managed to defeat the Dragons, the attack had left several sub-systems badly damaged and in need of parts that Harper couldn’t just throw together in the machine shops. So, the day before St. Valentines, off he had gone to the nearest drift in search of supplies. His meal had been left for the rest of the crew to eat and the champagne had been put back into cold storage.<br>
<br>
Harper twisted his mouth into a grin. Then his one piece of good luck, he had found that Trance had stowed away on the Maru. Apparently she thought Harper would get into trouble on his own and wanted to accompany him. What ever the reason, Harper was pleased she was here because it meant he got another chance to surprise her. After getting to the drift and finding all the necessary parts (and only having to pay slightly more than they were worth), he had gone shopping again. The Maru had been built for running cargo and didn’t really have a lot in the way of amenities, so Harper had gone from place to place buying candles, food and the only champagne he could find in the whole place.<br>
<br>
The next day, Trance had returned to the Maru to find Harper sat on the floor of the sleeping quarters, a rug stretched out on the ground and a small meal laid out. It had taken a little while to explain the general concept of Valentines Day to Trance, and Harper had become thoroughly embarrassed trying to explain that it was traditional to spend the day with someone you cared for more than anyone else. However, the look on her face and the delight in her eyes as she saw the candles, flowers and meal had been enough to satisfy Harper that all his hard work hadn’t been in vain. <br>
<br>
The champagne had bubbled nicely when opened, but they both decided it was most definitely NOT vintage and it was left largely untouched. Instead, Harper produced a couple of cans of sparky cola, which they used to toast to St. Valentine. When the meal was over, Harper brought out a small pendant with a purple gem at its centre and the outline of a sun etched around it. He’d picked up the gem a few months ago at one of the more ‘high class’ planets Dylan visited on his quest to restore the Commonwealth, and it had cost the young man most of his savings. He’d machined the pendant himself, even etching the pattern of a sun around the purple jewel. This was the first time he’d had the courage and the opportunity to give it to his best friend, hopefully signalling to her that he wanted to be more than just friends from now on. <br>
<br>
As he thought about it, Harper realised that the last thing he remembered doing before leaving was placing the pendant in his ‘secret place’ in his quarter’s onboard Andromeda. He idly wondered how it had managed to find its way into his pocket on the Maru, but he was sure glad it had. Trance’s eyes had almost popped out of her head when she saw it and she’d been almost at a loss for words, finally settling on throwing her arms around the young engineer and kissing him passionately, much to his surprise. He had been slightly puzzled at her saying ‘yes’ quietly as she accepted it, but he had given up trying to figure her out long ago so he hadn’t asked her what she meant. <br>
<br>
So that was how he came to be lying in his bunk with a purple pixie asleep next to him and a tale wrapped around his right leg. He gently gathered her into a hug without waking her and closed his eyes. Just before he drifted into sleep, he smiled to himself. In the past few years he had tried innuendoes, subtle hints, downright blatant hints, alcohol and all the chat up lines he knew. In the end all it had taken was a couple of sparky cola’s, an intimate meal and a small pendant.<br>

<br>
<br>
Part 2<br>
<br>
Trance smiled in her sleep as she wrapped her tail possessively around Harpers leg.<br>
She had overheard Dylan Beka and Harper discussing St. Valentine’s Day a few weeks back and her interest was piqued. She always enjoyed learning more about the cultures of her crewmates, be they Human Neitzschien or Magog. She’d gotten a bit of information out of Andromeda’s data banks concerning the human celebration, but had never let on she knew anything about it to Harper. Instead, she had enjoyed watching him get embarrassed and blush profusely as he tried to explain the concept to her.<br>
<br>
Harper’s behaviour over the past few days had been slightly curious, but she hadn’t really thought anything of it. She definitely hadn’t thought that Harper was putting in all this work for her. She knew he had locked himself in Andromeda’s kitchens several nights in a row before the Dragons had attacked; likewise she knew some flowers had gone missing from hydroponics and that he had recently spent a large portion of his personal savings. She also noticed that Harper had been staring at her when he thought she wasn’t watching, but that wasn’t anything new, and it wasn’t as if she didn’t do the same thing to him, albeit more subtly.<br>
<br>
In the end it was Andromeda who set things up for the two youngest crewmembers to be together, although this was unbeknown to both of them. First, Rommie convinced Dylan and Beka that Harper had to go alone as the rest of the crew were ‘needed on board.’ Then she had gone to Trance and subtly persuaded her that she should stow away on the Maru to keep Harper safe.<br>
<br>
Rommie had seen Harper off after making sure that the purple girl was safely hidden on board. Then while directing Harper’s attention elsewhere, she had slipped the small pendant into his pocket. Although Harper might believe that his ‘secret place’ was unknown to her, he had forgotten to engage privacy mode once while opening it. She had watched him over the security cameras as he studied something inside it for several minutes, as if deep in thought. Telling herself that she needed to know what was inside for the ‘good of the crew,’ Rommie had found and opened the compartment, discovering what was inside and deducing who it was for. <br>
<br>
As Harper slept, Trance smiled and stroked the pendant around her neck. There was no way Harper could know, but among her people a gift such as this was akin to an engagement ring in human culture. She finally guessed where all Harpers money had gone, the gem at its centre was one of the rarer types found in this galaxy and the pendant itself was made from Platinum. She thought about the gem and how its purple hue matched her skin almost exactly, how it sparkled when the light hit it just right, ‘Just like you, Trance,’ Harper had said.<br>
<br>
What with looking for spare parts and dealing with the traders on the drift, she hadn’t expected Harper would have the time to arrange a meal with what he had on hand and what he had managed to scrounge from the dealers. When she’d walked in the door to the sleeping quarters, she realised just how much effort he had put into the meal. Part of her couldn’t help wondering what it would have been like if they hadn’t had to go to the drift. She gave an involuntary shudder as she remembered the ‘champagne’. She was pretty sure the champagne on Andromeda would have been better, but there was a cosy atmosphere in the smaller Maru that he would have been hard put to reproduce in the wide open spaces onboard the larger war ship.<br>
