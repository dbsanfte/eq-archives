<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Age:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> 20<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Race:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Half-Vampire<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Quick Draw:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->A method of sword fighting that works using a sheathed sword.  It essentially allows the user to draw his sword so quickly that the strike is finished before a person could have seen it start.  The sword can be sheathed just as quickly in the same action, however it reduces the effectiveness of the strike greatly.  The attack also is much stronger then a normal swing is, allowing the blade to cut through much stronger material then normal.  Further knowledge of this ability allows for much more powerful applications.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Shockwave:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->Through an extended use of quick draw a force can be shot forward across the ground.  This cuts just as well as the blade would have and its range last until it has hit another object (wall, person, mouse, etc…)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Defense:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->This ability takes a large amount of concentration and a relative clear view of what is around the user.  Though the application would be useless for an attack due to the time it takes to use, for a defense against a projectile (bullet, mouse, etc).  When used it either deflects or destroys the incoming attack.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Force:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->With a few moments of concentration the drawing of the sword can extend that same power outward as a physical force.  Almost like a thin gust of wind.  Though it isn’t damaging per say, the pushing power behind the move is extensive.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dark gift:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Due to the mixture of vampire blood within his system he has gained certain abilities beyond that of a normal human or hunter even. He is very fleet of foot and can move almost as if gravity does not effect him, not flight but aerial abilities never the less.  It also allows him to phase out of space and appear in other locations.  Though this is limited in a range too 10 feet from where he is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Weakness:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->However this mixture has also given certain weaknesses to him.  Anyone that can sense vampire will sense him as being one.  Also just as vampire must live off the blood of humans, he must feed similarly.  However it is only vampire blood that can sate his hunger.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>History:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->It was the strangest thing to wake up too.  Imagine this, the last thing that you remember before sleeping is a world that is normal, fine.  Buildings are standing and life simply went on as normal.  The next thing you wake up too is this landscape.  A haunting image of what once was.  I guess that is the best way to explain things for how they are for me.  I am not really sure how much time has passed since I went under.  <br>
<br>
Their presence was something that I had been told off since well I was able to understand such things.  A few within our group were always picked and they were the ones that were trained to fight and kill them.  Well least try to that.  I was one of them, raised, trained and mentally prepared to take on those that stalked the night.  However this probably has you wondering just what it is that I am talking about.  You see vampire were not the only ones that hide from everything but themselves.  So did a small group that hunted them.  We really didn’t have a name but there was certain things that could have always been traced back to us.  I really didn’t follow any of those.  Perhaps that is why I am the last one left alive.<br>
<br>
It was my first night out, well the first one where there wasn’t someone else right there to watch me and safe my butt when I screwed up.  Which I think is really what happened.  That night is really rather foggy in my mind.  All I know is that I didn’t really seem to have that much of a chance.  As you might guess from that I lost against a vampire and I lost really quickly.<br>
<br>
I am not fully sure what was done to me, as far as was known the vampire that I went up against killed me.  But as of this moment I am not really sure that was the case.  Either way someone else must have found my body as when I woke up I was buried and rather well also.  By the time I reached the surface it really wasn’t what I had expected.  Kind of like waking up from a dream just to find that you are in another nightmare.  Ok so that isn’t really the best reference.  However there was one thing also that I noticed when I got back to the surface, what I was buried under no normal person could have ever lifted.  I thought for a second that I might have been turned, but it was day out and the sun did not hurt in the slightest.  It didn’t take long to figure out just what I was or what advantages it gave me.<br>
<br>
So I figured I best let them be used to the best of my advantage.  The buildings of cities might no longer welcome mortals in their walls.  But I think they might see me a bit different as those that stalk within them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vaniadelarian>Vania Delarian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#8B4513>(5/28/03 9:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/1898960.jpg width=125 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sol Kelric</span><hr size=1> Welcome!
