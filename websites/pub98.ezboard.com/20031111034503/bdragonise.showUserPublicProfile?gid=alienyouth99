I play volleyball a ton, trying to find a good place to play...I can't find anyplace.   I guess you could say I'm a music fanatic...I do a lot of browsing and checking out of new artists..and try to see if they're worthy of my ears.   I got to OSU full time...post-sec, it rawks.   </span></div> 		<div id="personalbio"><span class="title">Personal Bio ::</span> <span class="value">I'm Aaron, AKA Keats, I live in Columbus OH, but I won't tell where, lol Hmm, I bio for me, that could take a while, so I'll just fill in key points to me: Uhhh....scrap that, lol
Something that I've learned is that life is pretty short when you compare it to eternity, as the bible says: What is your life? It is even as a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes-James 4:14, I try to live my life by this verse because we're not promised tomorrow, and this whole life/earth thing, isn't worth me spending my time trying to please it, I've got a higher power to look up to.   

As you can guess, I'm a big skillet fan, I go to the shows...get beat up in the mosh pits, lol and I just love the band.  I just gotta rub it in your noses...but at the last concert I went to, I got to talk to the band for a good hour and a half....lol So I'm an official panhead, for the uneducated...look below if you don't know what a panhead is.   

Panheads - (pan' hedz) pl. n. - those [Skillet fans] who come to three or four shows traveling up to 10 hours, bringing skillets, banners, writing on their cars, and so forth. -Ken Steorts, founding guitarist of Skillet
