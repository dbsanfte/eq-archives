Such conservatives (including such notable drug warriors as Rep. Marc Souder R - IN, ex-Rep. Bob Barr R - GA, ex-Sec'y Bill Bennett) claim that any use of a &quot;mind-altering&quot; drug is always wrong. <br>
<br>
And yet, there are many prominent conservatives who believe that drugs should be legalized, notwithstanding any of the unfortunate consequences of addiction to such drugs.  The list of conservatives is quite impressive:  Wm. F. Buckley, Milton Friedman, ex-Sec'y of State George Schulz, Rep. Dana Rohrbacher R - CA, ex-Gov. Gary Johnson.<br>
<br>
Since I believe drugs should be carefully legalized, I will make the argument for this side.  Perhaps someone would care to make the argument in favor of continuing Prohibition.  <br>
<br>
Bear in mind, I want to focus solely on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>conservative</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> arguments.  And to eliminate the pejorative label of &quot;illegal&quot; or &quot;mind-altering&quot;, I will refer to these drugs as &quot;intoxicants&quot;.<br>
<br>
1.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Liberty</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->  As a general rule, here in the land of the free, people should be allowed to do anything they choose to do unless it demonstrably hurts someone else.  It is difficult to prove how moderate recreational intoxication hurts anyone other than the user, who presumably can make a decision for himself as to how he lives his life.<br>
<br>
In contrast, socialist thought asserts that the gov't knows what is best for all.  It despises individual thought and autonomy which must be suppressed for the good of the state.  What good conservative could support this?<br>
<br>
2.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Federalism </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> The U.S. Consititution does not empower the Federal gov't to control the distribution of intoxicants.  Thus, according to the principle of federalism, the right to use drugs and the power to restrict those rights, belongs to the people and to the states.<br>
<br>
In contrast, socialism teaches that the central gov't is empowered to do whatever the gov't decides to do.  They can control any and every aspect of your life, for the good of the community.  What good conservative could support this?<br>
<br>
3.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Free markets</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->  Drug prohibition is the worst kind of manipulation of what otherwise would be a free market.  By attempting to ban distribution of certain intoxicating substances, the gov't succeeds only in creating a black market.  Prohibition laws discourage, but do not eliminate the market.  However, the end result is that supply is vastly reduced and the price is driven sky-high, according to the familiar law of supply and demand.<br>
<br>
Consumers of such intoxicants are perfectly willing to ignore the law in order to get what they want.  But since drug distributors risk going to jail, they charge a premium.  And since the price is so high, intoxicants are priced way higher than they would be in an open market.<br>
<br>
Because prices are so high, many consumers can no longer afford these intoxicants, so they steal.  Thus, it is Drug Prohibition that introduces drug violence and crime and predatory pricing into our society.  Show me one sane individual who favors continued high crime in our society.  Neither conservatives nor liberals support this.<br>
<br>
4.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Compassion</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Because these intoxicating substances are illegal, users who abuse them often do not seek help to overcome their problem.  Legalization would reduce the stigma associated with addiction to a level approaching the stigma of alcoholism and nicotine addiction.  One can imagine advertisements on TV for a &quot;methadone patch&quot; to help people kick opiate addiction.<br>
<br>
Why did Rush Limbaugh keep his addiction a secret?  Because it was illegal.  Had it been legal, perhaps he would have sought help sooner, perhaps before he lost his hearing.<br>
<br>
Also, the worst aspects of marijuana usage are the harmful substances the user inhales.  In a legal market, the active ingredient in pot could be packaged as a harmless inhaled mist or as nose drops.  This would greatly reduce pot-smoking and make marijuana an almost completely harmless intoxicant.<br>
<br>
Moreover, one of the worse dangers of injectible drugs (such as heroin) is the risk of AIDS and hepatitis infection via shared needles.  It is likely that this danger could be mitigated if drugs were distributed safely and legally.<br>
<br>
5.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rule of Law</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->  These intoxicants are extremely popular.  They are popular despite being illegal.  They remain popular despite the approbation of society.  It is estimated that there are tens of millions of Americans who use one or more of these substances on a monthly basis.<br>
<br>
Tens of millions!  A CD that sells half a million copies is called a &quot;Gold Record&quot;; a million copies is called &quot;Platinum&quot;; they even have a name for a disc that sells 10 million -- they call it a &quot;Diamond Record&quot;.  If Marijuana were a recording artist, it would produce at least one Diamond Record every month.<br>
<br>
That's pretty popular.<br>
<br>
Whenever society tries to squelch a popular behavior, even if it is popular with only a fraction of the population, it never succeeds in eliminating the behavior.  Alcohol could not be successfully prohibited, no matter how noble that idea was.  Cigarettes cannot be prohibited.  Try as we might, we will never stop a majority of Americans from breaking the speed limit on a regular basis (think about that next time you are driving to or from work).<br>
<br>
Every time someone breaks one of these &quot;unpopular&quot; laws, he is showing a disrespect for the rule of law.  After a while, obeying the law almost seems optional, rather than compulsory.  Is this a good thing?<br>
<br>
Unlike speeding, which is a threat to public safety and must be policed no matter how unpopular speed limits are, illegal intoxicants harm only the user (except, of course, for driving while intoxicated, which is also a public safety issue).  By trying to prohibit private personal behavior (where public safety is not at risk), we are actually discouraging respect for the rule of law.  It tears at the fabric of society.<br>
<br>
Given that we know that drug prohibition will never succeed, would we not be better off concentrating our law enforcement efforts on laws that are not frequently and popularly violated, or on those which public safety dictates vigilant attention?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
In conclusion, the War on Drugs demonstrates big government at its worst and most ineffective.  It ends up harming those it purports to defend.  It creates a an artificial black market, causing harm to consumers (higher prices) and even crime and violence.<br>
<br>
It permits the central gov't to usurp powers that belong to the states and ultimately to individuals against whom the war is being waged.  And it tears at the fabric of society, weakening the bonds that tie us together as a community.<br>
<br>
And, worst of all, it is an offense to those who died to preserve our Liberty.  Men did not shed their blood and risk life and limb to make the State more powerful.  They did it so that we all could breathe free. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives.showUserPublicProfile?gid=therightguyatfcav>The Right Guy at FCAV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/30/03 10:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Drug legalization: a conservative position</span><hr size=1> In my opinion, legalizing drugs is NOT a Conservative position!<br>

The original poster went to great lengths to lay out his case as to why limited drug legalization IS a conservative position and in line with conservative values. The least you could do is put in even 1/10th of the effort that he did in refuting his points.<br>
<br>
I feel his case is pretty rock solid, and yours is non-existent.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should iterate what you feel &quot;conservative&quot; values are to you, and argue your position from there.<br>

<br>
A few question and then a comment or two.<br>
<br>
1.  Have you ever been around someone that is addicted to crack?  Do you think that legalizing it will help moderate the down time during the lows.  Or should employers have a 20 minute break every hour for those that need a quick fix.  <br>
<br>
2.  Have you ever been around someone that is at a party, with plenty of coke to go around, but not enough money to pick any up?  Sexual favors are always an option, but what about moral fiber.  Should we just throw that out the door?  The United States of coke heads sounds just great by me.  What about the lawyer that has not had a line since yesterday morning.  He has the shakes, cold sweats, feels faint.  I as a Judge would say, Order in this court, Mr X needs to go do an 8 ball before we are able to begin, so it is written.<br>
<br>
3.  A truck driver barrels right into a preschool, the police report says he was using crank for 2 days, and unable to sleep.  Sure you could say that one could be drunk also, but the problem there is that you can smell alcohol, you cannot smell crank.  So being busted without a bag of goodies would be hard, but a policeman would have no problem picking up the oder of someone that has had a few too many.So should we just start poring crank into a mountain dew?<br>
<br>
To me, this is not a debate on politics.  This is a debate in sociology.  I would be hard-pressed, without getting into a medical debate, arguing with you on the green thc.  I have a good buddy that does it often, and he works for a bank, and goes to school full time.  Problem with the wacky weed is it really is a gateway drug.  After a few years, you have to smoke so much of it to get the same results you once had, it seems easier to just step it up a notch to coke.  Seen it many times.  Also, and I am not a medical expert, but this same buddy used to be a kind hearted person, now he seems somewhat cold.  Not sure if that is mary jane, but that is what I believe.  <br>
<br>
You see, the problem with legalizing all of the other drugs is very obvious.  <br>
<br>
Alcohol can be consumed by very many without them becoming addicted.  Same goes with cigarettes.  You can not say that about all the other drugs.  Of course this varies by person, but I am talking in overall numbers here.  How often have you heard of someone breaking into a house to steal goods that could then be sold that would enable him or her to buy a 40oz beer, or a pack of smokes.  Now you chime in, but if it where legal.   Just stop right there.  Even if it where legal, the addiction will still have the same affect, and unlike beer or smokes, you have to have it now, and if you cannot afford it, you will find a way.  <br>
<br>
I really could post all night, clears throat, wipes eyes, morning.  But, the facts are right in front of you, not my little article of ignorance, but on the web.  I think you need to actually be around those that are addicted to &quot;heavy drugs&quot; before you come on here and write an essay about why we as freedom loving people should allow them to be just that, free.(not in economic terms)<br>

I will respond in the same way.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; 1. Have you ever been around someone that is addicted to crack? <br>
<br>
Yes.  No more pitiful than an alcoholic.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Do you think that legalizing it will help moderate the down time during the lows.<br>
<br>
Legalization would obviously have no effect on the bad side-effects of the drug.  Legal cigarettes do not make them any less lethal.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Or should employers have a 20 minute break every hour for those that need a quick fix. <br>
<br>
As they now do for lethal cigarettes?  No, of course not.  Why would employers hire crack addicts, or tolerate them if it were affecting the job?  It would be the same if someone had an alcohol addiction.<br>
<br>
2. Have you ever been around someone that is at a party, with plenty of coke to go around, but not enough money to pick any up? <br>
<br>
Addicts are a sad lot.  But I have known far more people who have used coke for a little while and decided it wasn't worth the bother.  It is just like the legal drugs of alcohol &amp; tobacco, some people get addicted and most do not.<br>
<br>
&gt; Sexual favors are always an option, but what about moral fiber. Should we just throw that out the door? <br>
<br>
If you don't think people don't do sexual favors for alcohol, you haven't been to many bars.  &quot;Buy you a drink, sweetie?&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt; The United States of coke heads sounds just great by me. <br>
<br>
Instead of the US of alcohol?  Does legal alcohol make us the US of alcohol?  Of course not.  We are not defined by the reprobates amongst us (and I consider drug addicts to be pitiful reprobates who are more harmed by the drug war than helped).<br>
<br>
&gt; What about the lawyer that has not had a line since yesterday morning. He has the shakes, cold sweats, feels faint. <br>
<br>
What about the surgeon who is addicted legal pain killers that he can prescribe himself?  This does not constitute an argument against using these substances within reason.  I cannot play basketball worth a damn, should we outlaw basketball because of my reaction to it?<br>
<br>
3. A truck driver barrels right into a preschool, the police report says he was using crank for 2 days, and unable to sleep. Sure you could say that one could be drunk also, but the problem there is that you can smell alcohol, you cannot smell crank. <br>
<br>
First of all, if a driver were to kill someone (whether it was in a preschool or a funeral parlor -- notice how you picked a particularly soft target, as if who died in the car accident were important), the police would do a prompt blood test and screen for any intoxicant, including &quot;crank&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt; To me, this is not a debate on politics. This is a debate in sociology. <br>
<br>
I am not sure what that means.  Our politics shape our laws and our laws shape and are shaped by society.  But in America, we're supposed to be free to run our own laws.  My father chose to smoke cigarettes and died at age 63 from emphysema.  Perfectly legal.  Really stupid.  But even more stupid would be to make this very dangerous addictive drug illegal.<br>
<br>
&gt; I would be hard-pressed, without getting into a medical debate, arguing with you on the green thc. <br>
<br>
So, let's start by legalizing pot.  THC is not known to be harmful in any way.  Inhaling it along with poisonous smoke is probably not a good idea, but if it were legal people would find safer ways to inhale it.<br>
<br>
&gt; I have a good buddy that does it often, and he works for a bank, and goes to school full time....<br>
<br>
Like most pot smokers, he is a valuable, contributing, tax-paying member of society and probably nobody would guess he smokes.  He shows no harmful effects.  So why are we punishing all pot smokers because of coke addicts.<br>
<br>
&gt; Problem with the wacky weed is it really is a gateway drug. <br>
<br>
I really doubt there is any evidence to support this.  You can draw stronger correlations between alcohol, coffee and chocolate and future cocaine use.  There are many coke users who have never used pot or at least not used it very often.  But there are very few who have not tried coffee and chocolate -- some even use these substances every day! &lt;gasp&gt;  But saying that a coke user started out with chocolate doesn't explain why such use <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>led to</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> coke use, if it did at all.  You can look at the number of chocolate users who did not go on to become coke addicts, but then you can also look at the vast majority of pot users who do not choose to do coke.  They are very different drugs with entirely different physiological and cognitive effects.<br>
<br>
&gt; After a few years, you have to smoke so much of it to get the same results you once had, it seems easier to just step it up a notch to coke.<br>
<br>
This is utter bull poop.  There is almost no effect of THC on the brain the day after you smoke.  There is almost no effect on the body after a few days.  And it is undetectable in the body after 30 days or so.  It is not known to cause heart disease (as is tobacco &amp; alcohol), nor liver disease (as is alcohol).  It does not cause brain damage.  It is one of the most biologically inert substances one can ingest (after water and chalk, I suppose).<br>
<br>
And why is it that you think it is just a notch up to coke.  There is a far stronger correlation between alcohol and tobacco abuse and coke abuse.<br>
<br>
&gt; Seen it many times. <br>
<br>
Pardon me if I do not believe you.<br>
<br>
&gt; Also, and I am not a medical expert, but this same buddy...<br>
<br>
The problem here is that such stories are apocryphal and anecdotal.  Medical studies are all that we should really rely on and unfortunately one of the worst consequences of drug prohibition is that we don't do good studies on drug use.  If we did we'd find that it is not as bad as we think (we know this because such studies are being done elsewhere -- check out the facts at www.norml.org).<br>
<br>
&gt; Alcohol can be consumed by very many without them becoming addicted.<br>
<br>
And no one is really physically addicted to pot -- the level of addiction to alcohol is much higher, as is the threshold of use which gets people addicted (meaning that it's easier to get hooked on alcohol).<br>
<br>
&gt; Same goes with cigarettes. <br>
<br>
Nicotine is the most addictive substance known to man.  I don't know many people who find it easy to stop smoking cigarettes.  I even think that most people who smoke for even a short length of time become addicted.  So I think you've blundered on this point.<br>
<br>
&gt; You can not say that about all the other drugs. <br>
<br>
Pot is not at all addictive.  The other drugs are, but none are more addictive than tobacco, with alcohol in second place (above even heroin!).  I wish I could find the study that claimed this.  But, I will grant that one study (which I can't even cite correctly) does not prove the point.  <br>
<br>
&gt; Of course this varies by person, but I am talking in overall numbers here.<br>
<br>
One need only look at the US population to see that we have many millions more tobacco and alcohol addicts than we even have people using these other drugs that you claim are so addictive.  That would seem to argue against your point.<br>
<br>
&gt; How often have you heard of someone breaking into a house to steal goods that could then be sold that would enable him or her to buy a 40oz beer, or a pack of smokes.<br>
<br>
Make them illegal and watch out.<br>
<br>
&gt; Now you chime in, but if it where legal. Just stop right there. Even if it where legal, the addiction will still have the same affect, and unlike beer or smokes, you have to have it now, and if you cannot afford it, you will find a way. <br>
<br>
I don't think you know many drunks then.<br>
<br>
&gt; I think you need to actually be around those that are addicted to &quot;heavy drugs&quot; before you come on here and write an essay about why we as freedom loving people should allow them to be just that, free.(not in economic terms)<br>
<br>
I have been.  I feel sorry for these people.  I hope they get their lives together.  But even nice guys like Rush Limbaugh can have addiction problems.  At least we're better off with prescription drugs because we can track the distribution.  With totally illegal drugs we have no idea who's using and who isn't.<br>
<br>
But we should not make our country a worse place to live and waste $20 billion in federal money every year in a drug war that has not ever been successful (and never will succeed), just to prevent a slim minority of screwups from ruining their lives.  The trade-off is just not there.<br>

It backs up a lot of what I said, however, they claim that high doses of cannabis does lead to tolerance (in other words, users need to increase their dosage to get the same effect).  However, they also say that many people do not develop a tolerance, particularly those who use it for medical relief of disease symptoms (e.g. Multiple Sclerosis, epilepsy, etc.)<br>
<br>
The data does not suggest that marijuana is completely undangerous, but it clearly shows that it is relatively better than alcohol &amp; tobacco. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coso21>coso21</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/8/04 10:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tsk, Tsk</span><hr size=1> You must be a democrat.

Something must have hurt your feelings, or maybe having to read so much is more than you can muster.  Personally, I don't have a problem reading or writing (or spelling, for that matter).<br>
<br>
Why does it bother you that I make these rational arguments that make your head spin?<br>
<br>
If you think it is all &quot;spin&quot;, as you say, then explain to me in words how what I say is wrong.  Specifically, if crack is so much worse than alcohol, why?  Crack can kill its user immediately if he smokes too much (heart attack).  Alcohol can kill its user if he drinks too much (heart stops).  I remember Secretary's Day in 1983.  A Carmel, Indiana nightclub held a Peppermint Schnapps drinking contest for ladies.  21 women were hospitalized and 9 died.  Perfectly healthy women.  Perfectly legal contest.  Dead of a drug overdose.<br>
<br>
But the burden is on you, if you're up to it.<br>

I think you might be less uncomfortable if you opened your mind a little.

The drug war is working! Why quit now?<br>
<br>
Just last week it was reported on FOX news that only 10% of all drugs headed for distribution in the USA actually hits the streets. That means, in one way or another, the drug war is making a huge difference. And personally, I would pay a little more tax to keep more law breakers in jail, but I have 2 requirements that must first be met by our Government before I would vote yes for a raise in my taxes for this purpose.<br>
<br>
1. Cut back dramatically on Govnt waste!<br>
<br>
2. Start deporting illegal alliens. A good place to start would be our prisons. Instead of the American taxpayer keeping up illegals because they broke our laws, ship them back! <br>

<br>
Today I got stuck in traffic.  It took about an hour to go 4 miles along a two-lane interstate.  Some people in the other lane saw my &quot;Stop the War&quot; bumper sticker and asked me what I meant.  I told them I wanted to see drugs legalized.  All three of them smiled from ear to ear.  &quot;We just wanted to see what side you were on&quot;, said one woman.<br>
<br>
So I'm not so sure which of us is in the minority.<br>
<br>
I don't think one person should tell another what to do with his life.  To try to dictate another person's lifestyle when it has no obvious effect on you is nothing more than a form of indirect slavery.  As Lincoln said (a Republican, mind you), as I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master.<br>
<br>
But then some continue to try to control others, I suspect because they are not sure they can keep their own life in order (but that's just a suspicion).<br>
<br>
As for illegal immigration, there's an issue we can agree on.  I don't know if you are aware of this, but the BCIS (formerly known as the INS) has 4.5 million pending immigration cases.  They are tremendously backlogged.  In other words, there's no way they can handle their current caseload.<br>
<br>
So now Bush wants to lay 7 to 10 million more cases on them?  How are they going to handle that?  Well, one way is to just wave everybody in.  But then, if they do that, how will they know which ones really have a job, which ones are dangerous (possibly former criminals).  <br>
<br>
If a man marries a foreign woman, after two years she can apply for legal permanent residence.  It used to take 3 months to wait for a 15 minute interview, during which they check to make sure that the marriage is real and not just for immigration purposes.  Now it is taking 2 years to schedule that 15 minute interview.  That's how backlogged they are.<br>
<br>
So how are they going to do any genuine checking if, with the stroke of a pen, their caseload is doubled?!!<br>
<br>
In short, despite what they say that the Bush administration is only bowing to reality by facing the throng of illegals we already have, they are, in fact, in la-la land, with no real plan to solve the problem.  The only thing that will get solved by this is that a whole lot of legal, voting Hispanic-Americans will be tempted to vote for Bush.<br>
<br>
Which, as a Republican I have to say is the only silver lining to a very bad policy decision.  It really makes me wonder if we elected the right Republican in 2000.  OTOH, if he gets social security reform (ie. private accounts) and yet more tax cuts, I suppose we have to take the bad with the good.<br>
<br>
But back to the drug issue... If, as so many conservatives are now saying, we have to face reality and deal with 7 to 10 million illegal aliens, then why do we not also have to face the 10 million+ Americans -- tax-paying, otherwise law-abiding citizens, mind you -- who smoke marijuana at least once a month?  <br>
<br>
There are times when we as a society have to recognize that we do not live in a perfect world.  Just as it would be impossibly impractical to arrest and deport 7 to 10 million aliens, it is also ridiculous to suggest that we could arrest and house in prisons 10 million marijuana users.  Currently, there are only 2 million prisoners in the federal prison system (perhaps as many more in state prisons).  <br>
<br>
We have to face that we could not every really arrest and imprison twice as many prisoners in jails that are already overcrowded.  And that's not to mention the dramatic negative effect it would have on families and businesses nationwide.  If you think that deporting all the illegal aliens would have an effect on low-level employment (hotel maids, restaurant workers, gardners, pool boys, etc), imagine what would happen when we start locking up doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, scientists, hairdressers, hotel managers, store owners, car mechanics, carpenters, plumbers, dry cleaners, etc, etc.  The decline in productivity and hike in the cost of local, state and federal gov't would throw this country into Depression!  Think about it -- a 2% decline in GDP is considered a harsh recession.  What would happen to the economy when you subtract 10% of its workforce across the socio-economic spectrum?  <br>
<br>
So, realistically speaking, we cannot and should not actually enforce our drug laws.  It's like speed limits -- most people break that law most of the time.  We don't actually expect the law to be enforced, we complain bitterly when we actually get caught.<br>
<br>
If you're like me, this seems a little crazy.<br>
<br>
And, despite what you suggested, the drug war is not succeeding by any means.  For 30 years we have been saying that we want to eliminate drug use and for 30+ years we have made no dent in the demand.<br>
<br>
As for interdicting 90% of the supply, as you heard on Fox, this is ludicrous, when you think about it.  The gov't has no idea how, when and where drugs cross the border (or, in the case of methamphetamines and pot -- where it is made or grown).  If they knew, they'd arrest the distributors, no?  And yet, people somehow keep getting a supply through means and routes the gov't has no knowledge of.<br>
<br>
By definition, if the drugs are getting through, even if it takes 9 shipments to get 1 shipment in, the drug war has failed.  And in fact, the price and supply of drugs is about where it used to be (in fact, cocaine is somewhat cheaper, I'm told, that it was back in the 80's when I used it).<br>
<br>
But in another way, the drug war is more than an ineffective and expensive gov't boondoggle.  Plenty of gov't programs fit that description, but few of them end up killing innocent people.  If you care about others (as Christians are supposedly wont to do), you would learn about the various people who are killed by police during drug raids.  Many have absolutely nothing to do with drugs.  Oops.  Sorry.  Promise not to do it again.<br>
<br>
Then there's the corruption problem.  Given the enormous sums of money the drug distributors are bringing in, the temptation for corruption is just too much even for our good American police.  Frankly, I don't blame them, because THESE ARE STUPID LAWS in the first place. But then, you knew I felt this way.<br>
<br>
You know, we don't agree on this issue and I feel very strongly that I have made a Conservative argument.  I wish that you would search your heart and find a way to at least stop questioning my conservative credentials.  Just because we disagree, that doesn't mean I am not a Conservative.  Who knows?  You may even someday see that I have a point and change your mind on the issue.  That sometimes happens when a person keeps an open mind and tries to reason through issues rather than cling stubbornly inside his comfort zone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milkchaser>milkchaser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/12/04 2:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Milkchaser....Re: Tsk, Tsk</span><hr size=1> In my last message, I did not mean to endorse breaking the law.  I said that I could understand why a cop would be corrupted by drug money, but the fact is, I like to think that I could never be corrupted if I were in their place.<br>
<br>
In fact, one of the reasons I am a Republican is that I believe it is important to obey the law, and I was revolted by the sight of Democrat Bill Clinton flouting the law.<br>
<br>
So I never should have been so flippant about such a serious matter as police corruption.  I apologize for that stupid remark.  <br>
<br>
And I also do not endorse meth making or pot growing either.  These are dangerous and stupid things to do.  I would be really angry if this kind of thing went on in my neighborhood and I take it for granted that it doesn't.<br>
<br>
I only meant to bring to light the easiness of these forms of drug production -- not that I approve of them.  In fact, one of the biggest disadvantages of our current law is that these drugs are not distributed through safe and legal means.  Even though some of these drugs are unsafe (like alcohol and cigarettes) that doesn't mean that people should have to make their own (can you imagine making your own whisky or growing your own tobacco?), nor should these users have to conspire with criminals (as people had to do with bootleggers in the 1920s &amp; 30s).<br>
<br>
But until this country, as I put it in the previous post, faces that it can't plausibly enforce its unrealistic drug laws and changes them, I don't even endorse using, buying or possessing these substances.  And even if they were legal, I would warn against using almost all of them for health reasons, both psychological and physical.<br>
<br>
I don't smoke cigarettes.  My dad died from emphysema.  If you've ever seen the effects of that disease, you know that it's not very encouraging when someone you love suffers from it.  But I would never want to see tobacco outlawed.  I know that this country would be worse off for it.  My dad did a very foolish thing, and he repeated it literally thousands of times:  he lit every cigarette he smoked, near about.  He killed himself slowly.  But he was free to do so, and that is as it should be.  <br>
<br>
So I am the last person to endorse using, making or distributing tobacco, but I do support legal tobacco.  I hope that makes my position clear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives.showUserPublicProfile?gid=therightguyatfcav>The Right Guy at FCAV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/12/04 8:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Milkchaser....Re: Tsk, Tsk</span><hr size=1> It's very hard for me to understand why you argue so strongly about this particular issue.

In one of your posts you suggested that there should be no difference between alcohol and drugs. We actually agree on this one. Why don't you put as much effort into outlawing alcohol. Even though I drink an occasional beer, I would have no problem with giving it up. Tobacco too!<br>
<br>
Yes, I understand that the chance of alcohol being outlawed are slim-to-none. These are the same odds I give to legalizing drugs.<br>
