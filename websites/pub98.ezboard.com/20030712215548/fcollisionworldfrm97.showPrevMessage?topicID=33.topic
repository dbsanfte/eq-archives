Please be clear. I just want to know so 'VICI' doesn't happen again. I had asked in an earler post in questions, in reference to Vici herself and had asked if I could use the sister of Goku. Your responce was something like as long as it doesn't have Goku, which bafled me cause I had asked if I could use is sis. Maybe its just me. I see things diffrently then most and it make it fusterating. So I guess my point is just to make very clear what you want. I can be very creative when given the chance. Some of you out there may disagree to this seeing how I was/am tring to use a saiyan, but you have never seen any of my characters in their true light. Even those who are based off of shows are a careful weave of a delicate tapastry. I have even sucseded in weaving together five diffrent elements into one beutiful character, but even though I consider him unique I wont even try to post him here or any where. I do hope to solve this soon~ <br>

<br>
An original character is something completely you. It doesn't tie into anything that anyone has claimed as original themselves. The material you use for an original character can be under NO copyright law. If you use copyrighted material in your character it is no longer original no matter what the material that you used is. <br>
<br>
Goku is under a copyright law, which is why you can't use him...<br>
<br>

It's simple. <br>
<br>
Your character may not...NOT...have any SPECIFIC reference to any COPYRIGHTED material (Genres are not copyrighted and thus, witches demons whatever may be accepted)<br>
<br>
So thus, Goku can not be anywhere in your bio. I know it's a hard reality to face, but your character is still your character no matter who they're related to. It's just slightly changed from what you originally wanted.<br>
<br>
As for the saiyan thing. We've nothing against that kind of ability. You just can't call it Saiyan. Call it Koenfed or Nayias or Tutu Bunny or whatever. Just not Saiyan. <br>
<br>
You're creative. Your characters are good. Just take out things that are copyrighted.! <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

Anything can be original the only restrictions are that it can't be under a copyright law, it's that simple! Really, I know it's annoying but it's the law, and the law is the law...&gt;_&lt; (I think that was in a corny movie I saw....the law is the law...! YES! it was a western...I think...)<br>

SO, once again, I will try to explain what we mean. Forget the whole copy righted thing, for like SSJ4 said we couldn't care less. How did you make your character original? Is it original because of the personality, race, what? That is what we are trying to get at. Forget the copy right law, we don't care and we don't want to be told something we already know. When you were creating your character, what did you do to make it original? <br>

Everything in the characters, in some way or another, came from us.  We might have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>based</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> some of the stuff off of other things, but we didn't copy anything.  <br>
<br>
The character that was brought up in here, Vici, I believe, was completely original up to one small point.  That was that there were parts in the bio that came directly from DBZ.  That's what made it unoriginal.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>That's all...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  It might have all, for the most part, come from you... But saying they were related to a written, copyrighted (don't care if you care or not, it's a factor none the less), and accepted character in a well known and published show made it unoriginal.  Above that you even used the race from that show that was specifically created by a specific company, owned by that company, put in one specific show, for one specific reason.  That's all that made it unoriginal, nothing else...<br>
<br>
If there are still problems... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>try</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to get on aim, or the live chat, or MSN IM or something to talk to somebody other than on a board... cause if that still didn't do it then I just don't think there's a way to express your question on a board type system<br>
<br>
And btw, before the other things are brought up... AGAIN... androids, demons, witches, and anything of the sort are not like saiyans, because they are a general classification that isn't owned by a person or company, but owned by a genre in general and can be used any way the writer would like to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=damonkeyhasvoicesinherhead2>DaMonkeyHasVoicesInHerHead2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/25/03 6:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Originality</span><hr size=1> Hehe, well it really doesn't matter much to me anymore 'cause we can still have saiyans on the site.

<br>
This is what Webster's says:  <br>
      <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That which precedes all others of its class; archetype;<br>
      first copy; hence, an original work of art, manuscript,<br>
      text, and the like, as distinguished from a copy,<br>
      translation, etc.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But it isn't always that simple.<br>
Originality is something hard to explain.  To me it's using as many of your own ideas and concepts as you can.  Thinking of something new and creative.  It can take a few minutes to create something original, a week, months, maybe even years (Probably wouldn't spend years on a new character, though.^_^).  But when you're done it's part of you and it's not easy to get rid of.  Originality...It's difficult to define becuase the definition isn't something objectively prescribed.  There's no list of qualifications for an original character, but there are things an original isn't.  <br>
<br>
For example, Vici was an original charater--but you used the Saiyan and related her to characters another person created without their permission.  In MY opinion--Don't go flaming anyone else here for it--having a Saiyan character is less original than the piece about Goku's sister.  If you take a look at ff.net both concepts have probably been used in fanfiction again and again.  It's how you APPLY the concepts, I suppose, that help give a character his/her originality.  Spelling Saiyan backwards...that's a creative idea.  <br>
<br>
The concept of Saiyan itself prolly isn't even fully original.  People draw on folktales and real life all the time.  Folktales and myths are the source for things like vampires, witches and, more recently, androids.  Taking things to a new level I suppose, refining ideas adds originality.  I think I've begun to ramble, AGH! &gt;.&lt;;;  Anyway, I don't think the originality of your characters is the main issue.  Like it or not, it's the copyright that really hit you.<br>
<br>
Besides, why do something that's been done when you can do something new?  Be a Jackson Pollock striving to get out of Picasso's shadow (but without the drinking problem and mistresses!)!  Originality is something that's never been done before.  You could argue that it's all been done, but it can still changed and reinvented to create something unlike the original.  If that made any sense...<br>
<br>
Anyway, people keep saying the &quot;same&quot; thing, I think, because your question keeps coming off the same.  I've a question for you, actually...How are people here NOT open-minded?  I get the extreme impression that they are.  And they're creative, too.  Where else have you heard of warriors battling a man-eating fig?<br>
<br>
Well...I'm going to end this little ramble here.  Gomen ne...lack of cohesiveness abounds in this post. &gt;.&lt;<br>
This could be an interesting philosophical discussion--what constitutes true originality?  But I think people are getting tired of the same question being asked. <p>*~*~*~*~*<br>

An original character can't have ANYTHING to do with something popular, like it most likely couldn't be some plant dude with a freaky organic type arm called angel or whatnot. Make sure you don't steal copyrighted named, do some homework! No one wants to be sued, and those companies ARE watching you...oh hey Satoru! I was just making a character that's a pink puff ball that sucks up stuff and uses the powers they had...no, it isn't a Kirby ripoff, why? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub96.ezboard.com/brpgrealm60839">RPG Realm</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=animagess@collisionworld>Animagess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 260<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(2/25/03 10:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> JUST EVERYONE GO AWAY</span><hr size=1> <br>

Further more, with this whole copyright thing, you said you asked the administrator about it, so I don't see why everyone else keeps arguing! It's over, it's done, make peace! <br>

For the records I understand the copyright laws and I wont get into what I think about the government. So sense you people want to talk copyright I'll say it that way.Now to get to the question, I want to know HOW you know whats copyrighted or not. (I KNOW the main chcracters are) I mean races. If there is some botten I can hit that will tell me please let me know (sarcastic if you can't tell) If I sound mean I don't mean to. I want to know about the races. Gargoyals for instence are a race from European mythology but our also in a show of the same name, how does that work? Also, how would thing like humonoid unicorns work, because there are very few things like that, but I can name the Acorna books that you can find them in. OK you got that? One more thing for now, what about sercumstances? In the Dragon Knight book the main character can turn into a dragon at will and in the Rift War saga by Ramon E. Fiest there is a type of dragon that can turn into a human at will, these types of things aren't that comon so how does that work?<br>
<br>
I think thats it for now.
