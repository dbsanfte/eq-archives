<br>
Certainly they use the OT and NT, but Muslims also recognize there was a Jesus (though admittedly they don't call him savior) and it just seems these additional gospels with their new and separate concepts of &quot;celestial law&quot;, &quot;baby gods&quot;, &quot;temporal planet&quot; that is set to self destruct in y3k so we can destroy it willy nilly, spirit babies, secret wedding ceremonies where men can call wives after death but women don't know the man's secret name, blacks can't be priests--then revelations from the prophets.....anyone else struggling with this?<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm getting at is all the other sects are agreed on core doctrine as they interpret it in the OT and NT even if they disagree the translations. Even JW's share most of their theology with Baptists, 7th Day Adventists, Calvinists, Lutherans, Catholics, Episcopalians...but NONE of these acknowledge additional texts (I know someone will bring up the Canons with the Catholics, but these are not the same as adding to the bible) that add major new components to the faith such as ruling planets, being gods and having spirit children or helping Jehovah create the earth. <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong--it's all mythology to me. I just feel perhaps LDS is so divergent it should be called something else. Almost the was Xianity is separate from Judaism and Islam separate from xianity though these may share some texts, xianity and Islam have additional, different ones that distinguish their core beliefs from the previous religion. <br>
<br>
At one time I would have said a xian is anyone who accepts Jesus Christ as his/her personal savior, but perhaps there can be another religion that also accepts him but adds on to it and so is no longer rightly called xian?? Thoughts?<br>

I always think of this as being the definition of a xian - as far as I'm concerned, if that statement is true for you, then you are xian.<br>

To me, some of the add-ons, really aren't any less Christian or out there than say, transubstantiation. I mean, planet families aside, I think it's odd to believe that eating bread actually becomes the physical body of a man presumed to be dead thousands of years ago.<br>
<br>
I think the key is belief in Jesus, and LDS have that in spades. <br>

<br>
How about the Messianic Jews (sometimes they are called Jews for Jesus)? They consider themselves Jewish. They follow all Jewish law and in all senses but one, they are Jewish. The one sense is that they believe that Jesus was the Messiah and that he died for everyone's sins. They do not even follow the Christian holidays (Well, most don't... I did when I was one).<br>
<br>
The problem that the Messianic Jew have is that Christians believe that they are Jewish and the Jews feel that they are Christian. They tend to be condemed by Christian Churches for their beliefs (sabath and kosher being two biggies) and sometimes, they are not alowed to participate in certain Jewish customs at a synagog (sp) because they &quot;are not really Jewish&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is just a thought.<br>
<br>

I think by all definitions, they meet Christian criteria, by  accepting Jesus (even though Jesus doesn't satisfy the portents of the Torah, but THAT'S another thread)....<br>
<br>
I read up on them awhile ago, and I still don't completely understand. I am assuming it must be very similiar to what early converts were like- those who were raised in the Jewish tradition, but then began to believe in Jesus, I guess. So they kept the Jewish traditions, and then embraced the new belief in a realized Moschiach.<br>

<br>
I do agree that many Jews consider them Christians, BUT many Christians consider them too Jewish as well. They don't really fit anywhere. As far as first century Christians, yes. That is what they feel they are like. They are like the Jews that believed in Jesus were before they were &quot;christianized&quot; by people like Constitine. To me, I believe that Christians should be like those first century Christians. Jesus was jewish AND he didn't come to abolish the law but to fulfill it, so why not follow Jewish law as Christians?? I know someone will respond to this with all types of Paul type verses. Paul was not Jesus. Paul was a self proclaimed apposile. Christians now a days follow the teachings of Paul and Jesus is a side note and lovely table centerpiece. Personally, I call Christianity Paulianity (drives my mom crazy too). I know that is harsh, but it is how I feel. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Gosh Rhinosmom..when did I say I was afraid of Mormons?? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  True, some of the stuff dag says is pretty weird and scary, but then as you point out it seems it is not necessarily church doctrine. And as for ignorance, all of the things I mentioned that give me pause are straight from Mormons themselves, who one would assume are not ignorant of their own doctrine, but  I admit I am assuming here and that might be a mistake.<br>
<br>
&quot;And when things are taken out of context, they sound strange. But, when you put them all together and you see how beautiful the temple ceremonies are, it all comes together.&quot;<br>
See, I thought you were going to go somewhere else with the &quot;sounding strange&quot; thing, then you went on the &quot;how beautiful the ceremonies are&quot; so it must all be true...darn. That's a fallacy so I can't take it as a valid point, but are you actually claiming if I watched some ceremonies in the temple I would think Mormons are xians? <br>
<br>
What I'm getting at is that it's possible for LDS to make sense to someone or even be valid and the truth (of course I don't believe it) but that would not necessarily make it xian. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have been through all the temple ceremonies and none of it feels strange or &quot;un-christian.&quot; I have gained knowledge, understanding and peace there.&quot;<br>
Again--I'm sure you have felt peace as Jews and Muslims feel peace in their ceremonies. Can you only feel &quot;knowledge, understanding and peace&quot; in xian ceremonies? I guess a xian might say yes to that. Also...what would &quot;un-christian&quot; feel like? That also doesn't speak to my point. I think you can have a valid splinter religion in which the followers find peace and even may see themselves as part of the old religion (Messianic Jews was and excellent example of this actually) but not be seen as still part of that by other members or even outsiders.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for the planet self-destructing, I admit I've never heard that. I don't think it's &quot;official&quot; church doctrine and I believe we should care for our planet.&quot;<br>
What a relief! I had not heard a Mormon say this either, but we had 2 here and I was starting to wonder how I had missed that.<br>
<br>
&quot;But if everyone started playing the no kids/one kid thing, we would die off &quot;<br>
hehehe...true, but it would take a loooooong time. Actually, we are so currently overpopulated it would do us all very good to keep it to 2 and under (course some folks have none, so it might average if some had 3 or 4). I don't say we should have none (unless you don't WANT kids) but 1-2 or even 3 is much more responsible than 6-8. We simply cannot sustain this growth and our resources forever and we must think of what kind of world we want the children and grandchildren we have to live in.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I just want to end by saying how ironic it is that everyone is upset Mormons might someday be called something else or not considered xians. I still would say I lean towards calling them this, but clearly they are worlds apart indoctrine than any other xian sect.

Just want to point out that this is not church doctrine in any way.  Yes, my dh said it and yes I have heard things about it, too.  But, not from the church.  It was actually a scientist. (yes, I do look other places for knowledge besides church).  I don't remember his name, but I'm looking for it.  If I find it, I'll post for you.  <br>
<br>
Just wanted to clear that up.  Just cuz a Mormon says something, doesn't mean it's doctrine.<br>

didn't mean to scare anyone and i admit that i got carried away.  in the future i will be much more careful to keep it all to myself since it's only the spirit that can teach and who knows where these posts are ending up once i click send.<br>
<br>
none of the stuff i posted really describes lds core beliefs and all of what you have stated has been done so out of context.  i was just playing along.<br>
<br>
you are probably familiar with the 13 articles of faith ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/a_of_f/1">scriptures.lds.org/a_of_f/1</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ).  go there if you want an official statement of what the church of jesus christ teaches.<br>
<br>
we believe that the original church that jesus set up was destroyed by the wicked.  there were other recorded apostles that were set apart beyond the original 12 but to fulfil prophesy all were eventually stoned or killed until the truth was taken completely from the earth.  (2 Thessalonians 2:1-3) <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/2_thes/2/1-3">scriptures.lds.org/2_thes/2/1-3</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
not sure if you know this but the term &quot;mormons&quot; was a derogatory term given to the early church members by their enemies that drove them from place to place.<br>
<br>
satan cannot destroy the church again.  it will continue to flourish.  a few years ago church membership outside the US surpassed that inside.  call us all tricked, brainwashed, whatever but you must know that mormons are totally committed to their convictions.<br>
<br>
if the true church of jesus christ does exist upon the earth then this is it.  you can have no personal conviction or faith whatsoever but that implies you think the 13 million of us that have felt the sweet peace of the spirit are all being tricked along with the billions of other people that believe in a higher power.<br>
<br>
we claim the privlege of worshipping almighty god according to the dictates of our own consious and allow all men the same privledge to worship how where or what they may.<br>
<br>
one celestial law that i cherish is that of free agency.  the choice is all yours.  it sounds like you already do alot of good so i'm more worried about myself making the right choices.<br>
<br>
if you continue to twist and thwart the truth to make good sound evil then i will just ignore it from now on instead of frightening everyone.<br>

<br>
&quot;... as far as humans destroying the earth and population control goes. there is no way humans can stop or slow the earth from global warming. if all humans everywhere drove their suvs and had babies non-stop we couldn't speed it up either.&quot;<br>
and why does he say humans cannot destroy the earth or overpopulate? because your beliefs are that the earth has a pre-set expiration date that none of us should stress over and the HF knew we would be bad and pollute anyway....<br>
&quot;the earth was prepared as a temporal training camp for us to learn about ourselves. our heavenly parents already knew us so well that the test here really isn't for them at all. there is nothing scary about this planet having an expiration date if you understand the plan.&quot;<br>
<br>
were the words dag used.<br>
<br>
This is where I got that Mormon doctrine about the &quot;temporal training camp&quot; as justification for overpopulating and being environmentally apathetic comes from. As dag says himself--I should not be scared about the &quot;expiration date if <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> understand the plan.&quot; Now I have to admit that Paige doesn't scare me, but this kind of talk about the planet being a training camp where we will all romp around experimenting and failing at it, but who cares cuz we all get our own planet and it's HFs big plan anyway does put me off a bit. <br>
<br>
Perhaps he is inserting doctrine into a worldview in which it doesn't belong, but it's easy to see where he implied the causal relationship and I'm glad to hear it should not have been presented or received this way. <br>

<br>
“not sure if you know this but the term &quot;mormons&quot; was a derogatory term given to the early church members by their enemies that drove them from place to place.”<br>
Okay, point taken. If Mormon is a bad word and it offends you, I will use LDS instead. It has less letters anyway, and I am not in any way attached to the word Mormon. Not sure why you included this in the middle of your post, but if it is really bothering you I’m sure we can all call you what you prefer.<br>
<br>
”satan cannot destroy the church again. it will continue to flourish. a few years ago church membership outside the US surpassed that inside.”<br>
I’m not sure what your point is here or how it is relevant to the thread, but perhaps you are thinking aloud. Noone is disputing or even discussing church membership. Is this another bandwagon argument?<br>
<br>
“ call us all tricked, brainwashed, whatever but you must know that mormons are totally committed to their convictions.”<br>
Have I questioned how committed you are? Has anyone here? Why are you using the work “mormons’ in your own post not even capitalized right after objecting to it’s use because you say it is a bad word used by your former enemies? <br>
<br>
” you can have no personal conviction or faith whatsoever but that implies you think the 13 million of us that have felt the sweet peace of the spirit are all being tricked along with the billions of other people that believe in a higher power.”<br>
Logical fallacy—you seem to think repeating this kind of argument over and over in different threads will make it valid. “lots of people believe and if you say we’re wrong you’re calling us idiots” is a fallacious argument and noone here said you were “tricked”. Please, I am begging you to educate yourself on the guidelines of debate and logic before proceeding with these types of argument. <br>
<br>
”we claim the privlege of worshipping almighty god according to the dictates of our own consious and allow all men the same privledge to worship how where or what they may.”<br>
Noone has said otherwise. Is there a point or rebuttal here? <br>
<br>
”if you continue to twist and thwart the truth to make good sound evil then i will just ignore it from now on instead of frightening everyone.”<br>
Hahahahha…oh dearie me, now you’re just being silly. Are you stomping your feet too? I am starting to question whether a debate board is really for you dag, or whether an LDS support board might not be a safer, more comfortable place.<br>
<br>
“i'm not saying you are liberal or i'm conservative but i would bet the farm that conservatives cherish the earth waaaay more then all the bush bashers out there who have never seen the country.”<br>
So you have data to back up the assertion that “bush [the president’s name BTW should be capitalized as with any proper name] bashers…have never seen the country”? Can you please provide the research for this and the data that conservatives are more concerned with the environment. A case could be made, but there would have to be rational arguments and supporting material. Please provide some.<br>
<br>
“i do not think the solution to all our problems is to make our species extinct or try to control human population.”<br>
Nor do I think the solution to our problems is “to make our species extinct”. What an ignorant thing that would be—and I was very clear about saying I do not advocate refraining from having children at all. We do disagree about population control though. Perhaps you have a rational argument against that with backup data.<br>
<br>
”i'm definately not making any prophesies here or speaking for the mormon church like you seam to do so well mamag.”<br>
Firstly “seam” is something that holds two pieces of cloth together. Secondly, you used the phrase “mormon church” again after saying it was offensive and thirdly, I have not spoken for the church, rather used your own words and asked for others to speak (like Paige). You seem to be losing your temper and self control here and that may be the cause of the incoherent posts, so again I would ask if you are aware this is a debate board and if you are shocked that I questioned your statements and am trying to debate them, perhaps a support board would be better for you.<br>
<br>
”nothing you've posted (or i for that matter) is correct and i'm sorry once again for playing along.”<br>
Wow—nothing either of us has posted here is correct? I can see you saying that of me (though of course you give no examples again—big surprise), but to say you yourself have said nothing here that is correct and that you were “playing along”. <br>
<br>
Dag—if you are interested in actually debating as per established guidelines without using straw men, the bandwagon or other logical fallacies, then let’s have a go. Other LDS folks seem to be able to handle this, but if you are just playing games and lying (as you said yourself you have done here) then I would rather you didn’t accuse others of “twisting” your faith around. Attack me with some reasoned argument and facts and we can have civilized and lively discussion for a change. <br>

I do not believe in spontaneous generation because the causes of maggots coming from meat left on the lawn to rot is scientifically known to me (flies land and deposit eggs, which hatch and then become maggots and flies). I could never prove that spontaneous generation doesn’t occur to you though—because it is false and a made up explanation of a natural phenomenon by earlier man later explained through good science. Same thing with the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus and god(s). Do you have “faith” there is no Santa? Do you accuse those adults who do not put cookies and milk out on Xmas eve of having “faith” that there is no Santa? Of course not, because anytime you say something exists the burden is on YOU –the theist to prove it (sorta like proving something happened in court. You might not have all the evidence, but a preponderance that is objective in nature would be nice).<br>
To create common ground, here is a definition of faith from Merriam-Webster:<br>
Main Entry: 1faith  <br>
Pronunciation: 'fAth<br>
Function: noun<br>
Inflected Form(s): plural faiths  /'fAths, sometimes 'fA[th]z/<br>
Etymology: Middle English feith, from Old French feid, foi, from Latin fides; akin to Latin fidere to trust -- more at BIDE<br>
Date: 13th century<br>
1 a : allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY b (1) : fidelity to one's promises (2) : sincerity of intentions<br>
2 a (1) : belief and trust in and loyalty to God (2) : belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b (1) : firm belief in something for which there is no proof (2) : complete trust<br>
3 : something that is believed especially with strong conviction; especially : a system of religious beliefs<br>
synonym see BELIEF<br>
<br>
As you can see, atheists by definition do not have faith. We have no “belief [or] trust in and loyalty to God” nor do we “belie[ve] in traditional doctrines of  a religion” nor do we have a “firm belief in something for which there is no proof” as theists do, nor do we believe “especially with strong conviction…[in] a system of religious beliefs”/<br>
