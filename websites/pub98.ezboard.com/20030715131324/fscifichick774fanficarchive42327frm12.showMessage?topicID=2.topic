Feedback: If you like it, just keep in mind that it's my first JAG fic, so no flames please. <br>
Archival: Go ahead, just let me know where. <br>
Author's Note: Response to a sort-of fic challenge from SamAndJack4Ever. Has to include a reference to a horrible and painful death for Brumby, and have Harm and Mac shippiness guaranteed. If you just love Brumby and can't bear the thought of losing him, please don't read this, because you'll get very mad at me. Also, kind of an anything can happen ending, but no sequel planned (yet).<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Sarah MacKenzie stood in front of her answering machine and hit the replay button again. She looked like she was in shock. Maybe if she listened to it again, that she wouldn't be hearing what she was hearing. Or not. She shook her head and went to sit down on her couch. She couldn't believe what had happened. The message on her machine that she had just listened to three times said that her ex-fiancé 'Mic' Brumby had died in a bad boating accident just two days ago. It didn't give all of the details, but enough for Mac to know that it must have been very painful for him in the moments before death had finally taken him.<br>
<br>
The breakup had been difficult, Brumby's words ringing in her ears long after he had gone. &quot;You don't love me. you just don't want to be alone.&quot; Now, he was gone forever, and she had no more chances to dispute what he had claimed. She mentally chided herself. After all, this had been a man who had been in love with her, and even after his death, she couldn't stop wanting to get the last word in. The shock wore off and the pain from the grief started in. Mac's eyes welled up with tears.<br>
<br>
A little over an hour later, her doorbell rang. She didn't even turn her head toward the sound. Then came a worried and persistent knocking at the door. She sniffled and wiped the visible streams of tears off her face. Numbly, Mac walked to the door and opened it, giving the man on the other side a blank expression.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mac?&quot; Harm questioned, tilting his head. He noticed the wetness that lingered on her cheeks and the red in her eyes. He furrowed his brow. &quot;What happened?&quot; She opened her mouth to speak, but only a crying whimper escaped her lips. Harm quickly wrapped his arms around her, and she set her head upon his chest, weeping again. He backed her into the apartment and closed the door with his foot. Harm pulled back slightly and raised her chin with his finger. He gave her a questioning look and she pointed to the answering machine. Harm nodded once and walked to the phone. He pressed the button and after the beep the message started yet again. Relaying why Mac was in her current state of distress. Harm cringed and turned back to face her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mac,&quot; he paused, looking for the right words. He was certainly sorry for her loss, but not sorry that Brumby was finally gone for good. Not that he would have ever wished the man dead, he reasoned, but then stopped when he realized he had made that wish on several occasions after Mac and Brumby had gotten engaged. And even a few more times after they had broken up. He walked over to her couch, where she was now sitting, and sat next to her, putting his arm over her shoulders. &quot;I don't know what to say,&quot; he admitted. &quot;You want to talk about it?&quot; She looked up at him, the tears beginning to subside. She sniffled and Harm handed her a Kleenex box that had been resting on an end table. She smiled in appreciation.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think I can.&quot; He frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's okay.&quot; She smiled again and leaned her head on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's just.&quot; she started talking, but then shook her head. He held her closer, nuzzling his nose into her hair.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't have to talk about it,&quot; he murmured. Although he wanted to console her, he didn't really want to listen to her talk about memories of a man that he didn't like when he was alive. He gave her a chaste kiss on the top of her head, and she snuggled closer to him without even realizing that she had done it. He smiled inwardly, happily accepting her new proximity. She furrowed her brow and turned her face to look at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did you come over?&quot; He looked bemused.<br>
<br>
&quot;We were supposed to go over to Bud and Harriet's, remember?&quot; At the look of no recognition on her face, he continued. &quot;I can't believe I remembered something you didn't. You realize that I'll never be able to let you live this down right?&quot; He asked jokingly, trying to lighten the mood. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was supposed to be Thursday,&quot; she said in a flat voice. He cocked an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;And today is.?&quot; Her eyes regained a little bit of their shine and she grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tuesday Harm, today is Tuesday.&quot; He stared at her blankly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Mac burst out in laughter. It felt good to laugh, to release some of the sorrow that had built up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I'm sure.&quot; Harm shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;My internal clock is off by two days,&quot; he stated disbelievingly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, that explains a lot,&quot; she teased. He smiled back at her. He could have easily brought up that it was a good thing that he showed up when he did so he could be there for her in her time of loss, but she seemed to be doing better not thinking about it. He also noticed that she hadn't pulled away from his comforting embrace, and he had no intention of releasing her from it unless she did. She rested her head on his shoulder again. &quot;Thanks for coming over Harm,&quot; she said in a quieter voice. He grinned and kissed her head again.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're welcome.&quot; He was looking directly down at her. This woman had been his friend, his partner, for so many years. She had born her soul and heart to him and he hadn't been able to simply open his to her. He frowned. If he had just told her how much he reciprocated her feelings, that he was just scared, then she wouldn't have ever gone off with Brumby in the first place. She deserved far better than Brumby, she deserved far better than him. That's what he was afraid of. Not that he would be able to commit to her, but that he would be keeping her down. She deserved the world. He sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; She gazed up at him. He shook his head, but the frown was still on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing.&quot; She arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Doesn't sound like nothing.&quot; She began to pull away from him, but he held onto her firmly. She looked confused and tried to push against him to loosen his embrace, but he kept his hold strong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't.&quot; His voice was firm, almost stern, but not loud.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't what?&quot; Mac asked, somewhat confused. He closed his eyes for a moment, thinking of how to proceed. When he opened them again, he fixed his stare on her. She shifted her position, a little uncomfortable under his direct, and not exactly friendly, eye contact.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't pull away from me,&quot; he said in a mellowed voice. She grinned sympathetically.<br>
<br>
&quot;Emotionally or physically?&quot; She asked, tingeing the question with a hint of sarcasm so she could wiggle out of it if he started teasing her later. His facial expression didn't change. She furrowed her brow in worry. Then, he did something that took her completely by surprise. He kissed her. She tried to pull away, reasoning that he was just doing this to comfort her, that he didn't really mean it. He was persistent though, and refused to let her go. She quickly melted into the kiss though, and returned it with the same passion that Harm was now displaying.<br>
<br>
Mac and Harm pulled away from each other.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow,&quot; Mac said. Harm smiled and nodded, still loosely running a finger through her hair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah. I should have made a move on you a long time ago.&quot; Mac laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I gave you enough opportunities.&quot; Harm frowned and sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, you did. I'm so sorry Mac. I could have saved you all this pain.&quot; She smiled and touched his cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's okay Harm. We just need to get that internal clock of yours fixed.&quot;<br>
<br>
