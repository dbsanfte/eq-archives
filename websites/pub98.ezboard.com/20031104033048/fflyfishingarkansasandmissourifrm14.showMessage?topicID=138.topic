I thought I would come out of the wookwork and say hello. I live in Bella Vista and fish the tailwaters in Arkansas. I also fish Roaring River in the winter C&amp;R season. I am hopefully going to get to go to Taneycomo soon!! <br>
<br>
I am also trying my hand at some warm water fishing around Bella Vista.  I have tried Sugar Creek once but without much luck. I won't give up on it yet though . . <br>
<br>
I am fairly new to fly fishing. My son (age 14) and I started about 2 years ago after a vacation to North Carolina. We came home and I realized that there were trout in Arkansas!! <br>
<br>
I am a member of Tightlines FF Club in NW Ark. Hi Ken! <br>
<br>
I hope to learn some from these discussions!!<br>

<br>
Last Outing: Beaver Tail waters with my wife and daughter last Friday. My wife tried fly fishing for the first time while we were in Colorado at the end of July. We stayed in a cabin near Evergreen that had a stream that ran by the front door with Rainbows in it. I handed her a fly rod and she fished for three days! Went shopping last night and got her, her own waders, boots, fleece pants etc etc. I also bought a new 4 wt rod and reel while we were shopping!! Anyways, back to the outing . . .  It was my wife's first time on the White (Beaver Tailwater) and she caught a few fish. Mostly 10-12 inch bows. I caught a couple also. My daughter, age 12, got bored with the rod quickly and found other things to do on shore. MY wife is now hooked so to speak and I think this will get me on the water a whole lot more!! This is turning into a thing for the entire family to do.<br>
<br>
As far as equipment, I have an assortment. We have 2 Orvis rods, 2 St Croixs, 1 Sage and rod that I built on a 7 wt Scott SAS blank. The last one was used for the White Bass run this last spring as it's maiden fishing trip! Without going into all the models, they are basically mid range rods from each manufacturer. As far as reel go, I have 5 from Orvis and 1 Lamson. I like Orvis's bang for the buck so to speak. I know someone reading this will bad mouth Orvis, but let's leave that to another thread! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As I sit down to write this, I have just finished gathering up stuff so my wife and I can go again tomorrow. <br>
<br>
Once the current generation get a little more predictable or at least when I feel I have a good chance of spending a day fishing and not watching water run, I am going to bring her over and fish the White and Norfork. <br>
<br>
My son and I have fished over there several time in the past year and love it. I seem to favor Norfork. I think it's because there are a smaller number of accesses and I now know them both!  . . . <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I really need to spend some time exploring the White more. For example I have never fished beloew the dam other than a couple hours with one unit on near the park &quot;wing dam&quot;. Didnt do much good then. That was last Feb.<br>
<br>
As far as flies go, I am trying to tie when I can find the time. I seem to be short and heading out to fish too often and have to resort to buying them. Now with 3-4 people fishing in the family I think I better get to tying!! I am not very good at it, but the ones I tie catch fish. They dont look as pretty as the ones in the store but they work. I am starting to believe that bad looking flies sometimes catch fish better than pretty ones. I have a soft hackle that has stuff hanging off and it still works . .  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sounds like you have a good arsenal of rods and there is nothing wrong with Orvis.  I don't think anyone here will bash your choice of rods unless you ask a specific question about a specific rod.  We only bash types of boats! (stab at stinnetti here<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  There is a lot of experience on this board by many who will all be willing to help in any way.  John is right, we are still all learning.  From FF75 I think the oldest?  All the way down I think you will find many helpful hints on many subjects.  The casting moderater is extroidinarily good.  Your probably familiar with most of the posters by now anyway and most will answer any questions off board via e-mail if you wish.  Myself included.  wishfish@wholedamarea.com  <br>
<br>
BTW don't worry about how your flies look if they catch fish.  Some of mine are pretty bad as well.<br>
Most are tied to catch fishers anyway.   Hope you get a chance to catch up tieing this winter.  I never get caught up it seems.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flynut62>flynut62</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#000000>(8/23/03 2:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: . back from fishing</span><hr size=1> All . . fishing update.<br>

We got there about 7:30. Fished till noon when they turned on the dam. Things started slow and stayed slow most of the morning. I saw some fish cruising a flat area of bare rock on the bottom. I driftes some nymphs through them without much luck. My wife hooked one on a small black biot midge. That was it on the nymphs. My wife got a couple more hits but no more hook ups. I caught a couple on yellow soft-hackle then decided to try something I never had before. I carry a couple sculpins but have bever used them. I threw a small near-nuff sculpin in there and started slow strips back. On the 3rd strip, a fish hit it hard, i set the hook and the line snapped! I had seen a couple larger fish in there but dont know which one took it. I retied on another and fell back to larger tippit. I got a couple more hits and hooked and lost another. all that in the last 10 minutes before tha dam came on. <br>
<br>
I will try those sculpin patterns again!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F9FBFD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bflyfishingarkansasandmissouri.showUserPublicProfile?gid=flyfishar>FlyFishAR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 489<br> <font color=#000000>(8/23/03 10:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fflyfishingarkansasandmissourifrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.flyfishingarkansas.com/Photo%20Gallery/tn_j.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: . back from fishing</span><hr size=1> Wayne:<br>
<br>
Try a &quot;constant&quot; movement with that sculpin. Either a swing or a constant stripping retrive. Browns will most often hit on a change in direction. Rainbows will most often try to inhale the fly. Those are two totally different retrives.<br>

Welcome to the board.  I am Jared Powell.  I have been fishing the BTW for about 12 years now so I know the area pretty well.  I also fish the &quot;big&quot; White and the NorFork as much as possible.  I work in a Fly shop in Rogers so if you need any help or have any questions, please feel free to ask.  It seems like you are doing well on your own.  The fishing below Beaver dam has been really slow but I think with AGFC working on a Trout Managemnet Plan it will improve significantly.  Good luck.<br>

See if those guys are wanting to go to the AFFTA show with us. Right now I may or may not have to go to Jackson for the weekend. We might spend the weekend fishing the Pan or the Taylor in lieu of flying over to fish the Snake and Flat Creek. There have been lots of fires in the Jackson area again this year so fishing might be marginal. Fishing central Colorado wouldn't be all bad.<br>
<br>
By the way Wayne, Jared is a terrific fly fisher, caster, and guide. If you are in the same area you should look him up.<br>
