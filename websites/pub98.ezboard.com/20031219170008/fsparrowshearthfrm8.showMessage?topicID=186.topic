<br>
it was taken at the site of the Little Big Horn..(Custer's last stand).<br>
<br>
Some time after the battle the grave markers were put up..each one right where the soldiers were found and buried. they are actually spread out..hundreds of them. this photo is from the main cluster...the 'last stand' area. but they trail down towards a small valley also and across the hill. i've been there a few times and it was really different then what i'd imagined.<br>
<br>
the photo is about 15 years after the battle (1876) and the men are Arapaho warriors, two of who were involved in the battle. <br>
<br>
its disturbing because they are riding over the graves of the men they killed...peaceful because i dont think they are there celebrating. the way they are looking off somewhere..maybe remembering the feelings of that battle and its victory for them...and yet wondering about the future because by the time of the photo the victory was really ancient history...it was the beginning of end. its like thier last ride...was that victory really worth it? <br>
<br>
it was a victory only on the fields...what it did was to create a backlash against them that is still felt today. at the time they had little choice. the troops were headed to attack the village. the troops would often draw the warriors out of the villages with one force then with another attack the village...then turn both forces against the warriors. but by this time the tribes had figured that out and attacked the troops with many men while the troops were still split up. <br>
<br>
i dont know...it always just seemed haunting in a way to me. in part because the men in the photo are from my tribe...they could even be some kind of relatives..we dont know exactly who they are...but i also think you can read so much into it. <br>

<br>
my daughters teacher said she was giving the class lessons last year when they learned about pilgrims and indians! she came home with a paper headband and some kind of green feather and drawings of tipis. that was ok, but she wanted to take her real feathers the next day! <br>
<br>
the teacher said she felt uncomfortable because she wasnt sure what to say about indians. i told her to treat my daughter like anyone...she can deal with it. its not like they are mean or anything to her.<br>
<br>
i just havent understood why more isnt taught. well i guess i do understand a bit. its not something pleasant. i dont like to make people feel bad, but i think healing comes thru the truth. <br>
<br>
people dont really want to consider that genocide was committed on the native people by the US governemt...only about 130 years ago or less. i cant even post alot of information about events its so horible. <br>
<br>
but i can give a few numbers....at one point before the europeans came to america its estimated there were at least 12 million people..american indians  in north america. by the late 1800's....approx 237 thousand. that means the population had been reduced by 95%. even if you lower that 12 million number the numbers are still numbing.<br>
<br>
my own tribe went from about 10,000 before the western expansion of the 1800's...to about 2000 people by 1900. and today there are about 6000.<br>
<br>
The United Nations definition of 'genocide' fits very well. <br>
<br>
a historian named David Stannard said, “The destruction of the Indians of the Americas was, far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world,”<br>
<br>
there is so much more that i would like some kind of extremist if i went into...examples...qoutes from letters and speeches of government people in the 1700 and 1800's. New articles...photos. I have photos of killed american indians being pushed into mass graves.<br>
<br>
and this is not in any books i see or was it taught in school to just about anyone i've met. actually the reason i have alot of those materials i mentioned was to prove it to people who didnt think it was true.<br>
<br>
well obviously i could go on and on about this! i didnt mean to get into it really. i dont like to seem like an angry extremists or to make people feel bad. or to feel bad myself...it can really bother me think about likei have to when i share it. but its something i'm willing to do because i think in the end it helps in the healing of everyone. and also helps people understand  more why some reservations are in such poor shape. and i cant hide from it...its a part of my history.<br>
<br>
<br>
well..i'll have to find something more happy to post about! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wordwolf>WordWolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;><b>Sir WordWolf,<br>Keeper of Odd Knowledge,<br>Bachelor-at-Arms</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#B87333>(11/8/03 1:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: speaking of cemetery photos</span><hr size=1> Once again, I recommend a book I have called<br>
&quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot;.  <br>
I think the author is Carl Loewen, a historian.<br>
<br>
I recommend everyone read it, if not buy their own copy.<br>
It addresses a lot of the history I NEVER heard in school,<br>
WHY I never heard it, and the reasons textbooks are in the<br>
shape they're in.  &quot;History&quot; as we usually learn in in the US<br>
is basically an indoctrination into patriotism.  This country<br>
was founded by rigorous idealists, and things may have had<br>
problems at times, but they've steadily grown better, thanks<br>
to the contributions of peoples from Europe and their<br>
descendants.   This pious, sterile optimism divorces all the<br>
events from the reasons why they happened, and either<br>
distorts, rewrites or utterly ignores the events that don't<br>
jibe with it. <br>
<br>
I was thinking of this book as soon as Withanape said he was<br>
surprised how little is taught, and he was taught.  It <br>
addresses American history from before the first &quot;settlers&quot;<br>
up to about 1970, addressing everything usually left out.<br>
That includes things I'm fairly certain will surprise Withanape<br>
about how the &quot;settlers&quot; &quot;colonized&quot; all over his ancestors,<br>
and a lot of people's ancestors, including about 15/16ths of<br>
my own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wihinape>Wihinape</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;><b>Spirit of Wyoming<br>Dancer</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#B87333>(11/8/03 6:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re</span><hr size=1> i'm not sure alot would surprise me about all that at this point.<br>
<br>
i think you're right that history in mny schools being indoctrination into patriotism. its one explanation as to why so much is left out. <br>
<br>
i dont expect schools to teach the way i was taught...i went to a pretty small school for a while....the west part of Wind River reservation is not exactly the center of education. i wouldnt even want that. but a little more about the whole period would be be nice.<br>
