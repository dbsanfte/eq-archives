<br>
Nina grinned like a madwoman into the end of Zil's gun, only to reply plainly, &quot;I like to keep my prey on their toes.&quot;<br>
<br>
That was then that the ground instantly commenced to tremble uncontrollably. Its tremors distorting Zil's perception of her target, allowing Nina the advantage to kick the other girl's cumbersome form off her own. Rising to her feet whilst Zil recovered her fighting stance. Runic glyphs began to shimmer and engrave themselves into the pavement as the quakes became more violent.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell?!&quot; Hotaru exclaimed, dashing for the ominous circle of blue light, her menacing wings carrying her swiftly across the street, only to meet with a conflicting force as the runes intensified and materialized into a barrier, surrounding Nina and Zil in a sizeable arena.<br>
<br>
Nina smiled and waved at the enraged vampiress, furiously swinging at the magical barrier with her glaive. &quot;Well, so much for those two,&quot; she commented herself on a well-placed trap, turning to Zil and drawing her sword. The katana was impaitent and demanded bloodshed as it glowed intensely.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you planning to do??&quot; Zil demanded of her, somewhat skeptical.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hows about a proposition?&quot; she suggests smugly with a few mock swings of her sword. &quot;If you beat me in a one-on-one battle, I'll leave you guys alone . .  . aaaaand . . .&quot; a few more swings, the sword was positively screaming as it sliced through the air, &quot;If you lose, I drag whatevers left of you to my employer . . .&quot; she adds with the faintest glimmer in her eyes . . . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hotaruvalentine>Hotaru Valentine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/20/03 9:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BWHA! I AM the spastic bountry-huntress! Or am I? (grin)</span><hr size=1> I slashed repeatedly at the barrier as Fearix landed beside me. I said in between swings, &quot;God..damn...it!&quot; I slammed the glaive into the ground, slamming it through the concrete into it's own earth sheath. &quot;Sonofa-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A rune barrier...&quot; I glanced at Fearix then back at the competitors in the barrier ring. My claws extended as I thrusted my whole body weight into the majic wall. I felt my fingertips within it as a surge of electricity twisted throughout my whole frame. I pulled back and felt the steam as it rose off my limbs. I heard Nina laugh, wink then shake her index finger back and forth at me. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wouldn't try that again, if I were you.&quot; I bared my fangs as I growled at her. ((I'm going to help Zil. No matter what.)) I stumbled to my feet, sorting through my options. ((Keep trying to rip it apart using claws, wings and glaive or turn into more of a monster that Umbrella made me...)) A shudder went down my spine as I resented becoming that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>thing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I despised most. ((But the claws and glaive dont have a great enough effect with my strength as it is now...)) My mind raced as I stared at the opponets. ((what other choice is there...?)) I looked to Fearix.<br>
<br>
&quot;Got any ideas?

Zil shook her head and smirked, glancing at her friends outside the makeshift arena.  She put her hand up, signaling for Hotaru and Fearix to stop trying to break the barrier.  &quot;I pity you, Nina Inhertz.&quot;<br>
She turned to Nina and saw the somewhat curious and angered face of Nina.  <br>
&quot;It's all about the fight, right?&quot;  Zil shook her head again, &quot;I'd love to kick your sorry @$$ , but...that's not the game I play.  Besides...&quot; Zil steps up to the barrier and places her hand on it, feeling the electric current run through it.  &quot;You are a sorceress.  I have no magical powers.  I know a spell or two...but, nothing compared to you, i'm sure.&quot;  <br>
Zil smirks and looks back at Nina.<br>

<br>
“What else can I say? You’re a bounty-hunter afterall,” Zil retorts cynically<br>
<br>
Nina can’t help but snicker in amusement, her face suddenly growing darker, “Even so, there’s some remote sense of honor among thieves. I give you my word as a despicable and low-down bounty hunter that I won’t use my magic in a competition of skill . . . besides,” she adds, smirking sadistically, “I’m curious to encounter that hidden power of yours you contain so well.”<br>
<br>
Zil hesitated in bewilderment, realizing that she was referring to Nemesis. “You’re crazy!” she spat, abhorrent of the notion that this person would even suggest a thing.<br>
<br>
Nina brandished her sword about, crouching into a fighting stance, “You don’t have much of a choice in the matter, now do you?”<br>
<br>
With those last words of she lunged at Zil, the katana’s bloodlust would be sated . . . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zil15>Z I L 15</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/21/03 9:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: (Does her best Monty Python) Awww, ur no fun anymore!</span><hr size=1> Zil times her move perfectly and drops down just before Nina reaches her.  Using her leg strength as well as Nina's own momentum against her, Zil rolls unto her back and flips Nina into the barrier.  <br>
Rolling onto her feet, but still crouching, Zil states, &quot;Know this, Nina:  In most cases, I'd rather die than loose control to Nemesis.  And if you think I'm gonna allow some annoying bounty hunter to simply make me drop my guard, you're outta luck.&quot;<br>
Nina's back on her feet and grinning at Zil, &quot;We'll see.&quot;<br>
&quot;Indeed we shall.&quot;  Zil's lightening quick draw shows and before Nina can react, the tranquillizer from Zil's gun is in her shoulder.  <br>
Nina remains standing, it would take more than an ordinary tranquillizer to take her down.  But, she is weakened.  <br>

Fearix takes a step back knowing Hotaru's power, and quickly glances over at Zil who seems to be entering a weakened state. Fearix grinds his teeth together, his fangs slightly showing a white glint in the moonlight of the night, trying to think of what he could possibly do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe if I do this right....&quot; Fearix mutters to himself, placing his two hands together. Ice forms around his two fingers, and soon shoots directly at the magical barrier before him.... But no avail. The ice doesn't even penetrate the wall before him, but he notices that the barrier is becoming weak itself which means that the sorceress must becoming weak as well. &quot;All I can do is wait.... But Hotaru....&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl continues to pierce the night with a shrill scream of a vampire, slowly losing her sanity. Fearix only wonders where people like Kyt and Demios are.... <p>They'll never see <br>
I'll never be<br>
I'll struggle on and on to feed this hunger<br>
Burning deep inside of me<br>
<br>
But through my tears breaks a blinding light<br>
Birthing a dawn to this endless night<br>
Arms outstretched, awaiting me<br>
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree<br>

This wasn't working. She suddenly felt tired, but it wasn't because of the shot she had just been injected with. The katana in her hand  had grown dangerously impaitient, her hand trembled noticeably.<br>
<br>
She felt drained, crouching closer to the ground as if she were about to loose balance, the source of her weakened state the only thing that supported her. The forcefield dispersed from a lack of mental energy and she sighed in frustration.<br>

&quot;Right right, I'll help your messed up friend over there,&quot; she sighed, waving a hand passively in the vampiress' general direction, &quot;But you got to promise me you won't blow my head off with those Uzis . . .&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hotaruvalentine>Hotaru Valentine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/25/03 9:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ano? :tilts head: Go random subject!</span><hr size=1> -subject 5896 back up system complete.- The voice rung in my head. ((What?!)) My screams abruptly subsided as I staggered to my feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the...?&quot; I cocked my head sharply in their direction.<br>
<br>
&quot;Beyond any sorceress's help now...&quot; I spoke boldly as I lifted the deadly mideval glaive from it's earthly sheath. ((What the f*ck?! I didn't even say anything!))<br>
<br>
&quot;Hotaru...?&quot; Zil questioned uneasily. Nina cocked a brow and Fearix plainly stared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great. What now?&quot; Fearix asked impaintently as he began to approach me, &quot;Cut the sh*t, Hotar-&quot; In an instant, a Glock pressed smugling into his forehead. &quot;bitch!&quot; My empty eyes looked at him then glanced at Zil and Nina. ((No goddamnit!)) I struggled for control once again, panicing to do something. ((What the hell is going on?!)) <br>
<br>
-Didn't think we'd let you go that easily did you? Took us years to catch you again, though we didn't expect you to survive after all those viral injections...- <br>
<br>
((DAMN YOU!)) The smooth crisp voice laughed softly as the mental struggle for control continued. My hand with the gun trembled as I shakily and slowly brought it down. I grinded my teeth feeling the eletric currents continuously travel throughout my body for each second I tried for control. ((Do something...))  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninainhertz>Nina Inhertz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/26/03 9:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Whee-HOO! Randomness! ^_^</span><hr size=1> Zil turns abruptly to eye Nina, who had yet to rise from the ground. &quot;If you're going to help, now would definitely be a good time to do it,&quot; she suggests impaitiently, although somewhat anxious as well. She certainly wasn't looking forward to engaging in another battle with her comrade.<br>
<br>
Nina sighs, regaining her somewhat stoic composure as she stood, stretched, and sauntered towards Hotaru, who continued her mental struggle with the unseen force.<br>
<br>
The gun instantly redirected itself from Fearix to Nina as she approached and the vampiress lost herself for a moment. -Kill her- was the objective issued. But the weapon was severed in two just as instantaneously. Hotaru blinked, her trembling hand still clutching to the handle.<br>
<br>
A finger tapped the immortal's shoulder from behind. The immortal's blank, expressionless eyes followed as the sorceress came from behind her, producing a small slip of paper with distinct markings and smacking it on the other woman's forehead, sending her to stagger back.<br>
<br>
Zil and Fearix watched, dumbfounded and more than a bit confused, as Nina clasped her hands together and a brief flash of crimson light enclosed the two combatants.<br>
<br>
Hotaru shrieked as she felt the invasion of her head grow considerably sizeable at the moment, clutching her head in pain as Nina stood before her calmly, eyes shut and concentrating on finding the puppet-master that subsided in the vampiress' subconciousness.<br>
<br>

I took my hands away from my head and grinded my teeth as I shakily lifted my head in the sorceress's direction. I didn't see Nina, but rather scientists and I was in the lab. ((This isn't real...)) My menacing eyes darted back and forth as one of the scientists approached.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hotaru...?&quot; Zil's voice seemed so distant and the everything was too blurry to make out faces. I froze and tried not to move, tried to resist from tearing the lab workers apart. She placed a hand on my shoulder and asked again, &quot;Hotaru...? It's me, Zil.&quot; I raised my trembling hand and grabbed onto her arm as I heard gasps from the other two. There was a slight pause.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't see...&quot; I murmured to her. &quot;I'm not sure what is real...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell are you talking about?!&quot; Fearix asked in an tone of disbelief. He came forward quickly as my instincts kicked in. Nina intercepted him and shook her head. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tisk. Aren't you an idiot?&quot; She said bluntly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You little bi-&quot; Nina slapped a white strip of paper with symbols on it on his forehead as he froze. I heard Nina chuckle slightly and a thud from Fearix's fall. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ain't paralysis great?&quot; She asked in an all too happy voice as the stuttered Fearix mutter curses. I slowly raised a hand to the back of my head, touching a little bump that was covered by my reddish black hair. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's.. a chip...&quot; I told them as Nina looked up from the fallen Fearix.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn Umbrella...&quot; Zil muttered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn Nina!&quot; The frozen Fearix said angrily and Nina rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aww, Shut up before I decide to kill you.&quot; He fell silent. Nina now stood beside me as I knelt down, indicating where the chip was. <br>
<br>
&quot;This will have to be handled carefully...&quot; Zil said in a serious voice. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm getting bored...&quot; ((Was this witch for real? God! She acts like a kid sometimes!)) <br>
<br>
&quot;Gonna need my...What the hell?! Nina!&quot; I glanced behind me at Nina who held a tazer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kid, huh?&quot; ((Oh Sh*t.)) &quot;Do things my way.&quot; She slammed the tazer in the back of my head, placing the two tips on opposite sides of the chip. I held in my scream as my eyes went wide in pain. My vision went black momentarily and I heard Zil yelling at Nina. The shock stopped as I opened my eyes slowly. I stumbled to my feet as my vision returned to normal. ((No lab... No scientists...)) The two became quiet and looked at me. I narrowed my eyes and grabbed Nina by the neck with extreme speed and lifted her eye level to my face. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yea... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kid.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; She smiled wide and shook her hands back and forth. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well heh what can I say.. heh heh.&quot; I dropped her roughly as she adjusted her shirt.<br>
<br>
&quot;Agressive, aren't we?&quot; I glared at her then cracked my neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're one to talk.&quot; She made a pouted expression as I flexed my wings. I sighed slightly in relief, &quot;I'm just glad that they didn't say the trigger word.&quot;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninainhertz>Nina Inhertz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/31/03 1:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I call everyone &quot;hun&quot;!

She had seen things in the immortal's head that she knew well enough not to tamper with, hence the need for a more technological tool . . . effective, though not as damaging to the subconcious psyche as a mind ravaging spell could accomplish.<br>
<br>
After being released from the taller being's grasp, Nina grinned smugly and twirled the modified taser on her finger. &quot;Anyhoo . . . now that you promised not to take my head off or anything, I assume you'll want to know who exactly sent me . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who said anything about NOT taking your head off?&quot; growled Fearix, still paralyzed (although unfortunately it didn't affect his speech).<br>
<br>
&quot;Down boy,&quot; Nina cooed, snapping her fingers. The slip of paper automatically split in two and Fearix fell to the ground with a thud and a &quot;oof!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If my brother didn't send you, then who did?&quot; Zil interjected. She was anxious to know.<br>
<br>
Nina's expression suddenly grew darker as she looked down at the katana in her hand forlornly. &quot;You see this sword? The both of us go way back . . . quite a funny story actually,&quot; she comments sarcastically. Her eyes narrowed and the dull blue faded. &quot;It feeds on magical energy, and if I don't keep up with its appetite it eats away at me. I was sent to feed off that monstrous energy that you possessed . . .&quot; she finishes, eyes intent on Zil. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hotaruvalentine>Hotaru Valentine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/1/03 4:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> unless yer southern, sug, I aint called hun!</span><hr size=1> ((OOC-okay.

<br>
&quot;Go feed off someone else's energy, b*tch. We dont have time for your pathetic little games.&quot; My bloodlust rage was screaming to take over as I held it inside. I was ready to tear her apart. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Destruction....</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I shuddered slightly and shook my head once trying to focus. The energy shield that allowed my dark energy to be hidden was slowly starting to break. ((@#%$ it.. not now.)) Zil grabbed my shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;This isn't your battle Hotaru. Don't get involved.&quot; I froze for a second in thought then simply smiled and my mind began to race, piecing a plan together. <br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever you say, Zil.&quot; Fearix stared as I pulled back out of the way slowly. He came over and stood beside me.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's the first time I've ever seen you decline from a fight before.&quot; I glared at him then looked back at the other two. ((just gotta wait...))<br>

Leon taps the glass separating himself and the driver of the limousine.<br>
<br>
?Stop here, please.?<br>
<br>
The driver slows to a halt and Leon opens the door just as a scream perforates the night air. He stands in front of the hospital, enjoying the sound and hoping that it was Nina?s work. But of course it isn?t.<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
?If you want a job done, you have to do it yourself.?<br>
<br>
Leon smirks and jumps straight up, onto the roof. His slightly opened, white dress shirt waves along in the breeze as he walks along the empty space. Three buttons are keeping it from flying away. It?s free, just the way he likes it. ((OOC: If you want to know what my char looks like just go to char bios and look for Leon Heart.))<br>
<br>
He reaches the ledge and looks down. Nina is holding her sword, explaining something to her bounty.<br>
<br>
?YO! NINA!!!?<br>
<br>
Nina turns and pales as she sees her true employer on top of the hospital.<br>
<br>
?I am quite disappointed!?<br>
<br>
He waves his finger at her.<br>
<br>
?I give you a job, I offer your sword a free lunch, and you play silly games with the bounty!?<br>
<br>
Nina seems rather stunned at his words. <br>
<br>
?...And you!? he points at Zil. ?Why won?t you die?!?<br>
<br>
?And you!? he points at Hotaru. ?What?s with all the screaming?!?<br>
<br>
He waves a hand at Fearix, nonchalantly. ?I don?t know who the hell you are either, but I don?t like you!?<br>
<br>
Leon brushes a stray lock of hair out of his line of sight. ?You?re fired, Nina. It appears you?ve lost all use. As for all of you scientific abominations... I?ll deal with you later.?<br>

Leon must have looked peeved from the considerable distance but on the roof he is calm and content. He glares at the general area where Hotaru is standing and a tree falls right in front of her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oops...&quot; Leon says in a sarcasta-innocent voice. &quot;How did that happen? Must have been the wind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hotaru is unmoved and so is Leon. <br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps 'later' should be now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nina steps back a bit as if expecting a blow. Leon has never hurt her but the stories about him are brutal and so is he.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good looks won't save you pal,&quot; Fearix comments.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whoever you are, come and get us!&quot; Zil adds.<br>
<br>
Leon steps of the ledge, falls twenty stories, and lands lightly several yards away from the crowd.<br>
<br>
&quot;Happy to oblige!&quot;<br>
<br>
He thrusts his hands out and an invisible force rushes at crew.<br>
