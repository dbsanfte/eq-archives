He had marked the major ones on the below ground side before the sun went, so he knew what street he was at back in the old days of running from the law. It turned out to be very useful when running from vamps as well. Pushing the cover off, he let Taylee go ahead of him with the baby.<br>
<br>
Climbing out himself, George looked towards the seemingly run down building. Some of the top windows were busted out, but George had reinforced all of them by welding a large steel plate behind the glass. Something him and Eric worked on a while ago. Beside the door was a keypad, modified from a credit card machine, and not nearly as advanced. George punched in the number, not letting Taylee see it, and disarmed the bomb. As soon as they were in and the door was shut, the boy rearmed the bomb and lit a few candles. &quot;Home Sweet Home.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vaniadelarian>Vania Delarian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/12/03 9:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eigabaka1.com/img/angelina_jolie.jpg width=125 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home Sweet Home</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I watched the familiar faces from a distant as my silent blood tears fell down my cheeks.

I ran as fast as I could to that lid, my body moving in a blur, the vampire that had changed me was obviously old, for I was quite strong and fast for a new born. My fists pounded hard on the top of the man hole, forgetting that I could lift those heavy things now, but I guess unknown to myself it is a good thing I did not try to lift it.

She felt a pair of arms grab her and and gasped as it felt like she was falling, clutching on to the man that held her.<br>
<br>
They reached the floor of the sewer tunnel and George pulled her along saying <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Let's go.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> As they fled Taylee thought she heard someone screaming their names but was afraid it could be some trick of Cale's, so didn't mention it.<br>
<br>
After some time running through the discusting sewers, George seemed to find what he was looking for and they emerged heading for a derelict building. George stopped at the door and blocking Taylee from seeing did something to make the door open. She followed him in and as he lit some candles, looked around as she heard him say, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Home Sweet Home.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Setting the sleeping child down in a large chair, Taylee turned her eyes narrowing in anger as she advanced on the man. &quot;YOU BASTARD!&quot; she hissed as she got closer to him &quot;I thought you were going to-to kill me...and ..and it was all a fake?&quot; By now Taylee was almost in his face, &quot;How could you do that?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/13/03 1:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home Sweet Home</span><hr size=1> George had straightened the makeshift mirrors that caused the whole place to light up.

Or perhaps you wanted to go with that stupid redhead, or Devereax?&quot; George had saved her life and she was terse. That plus he just made a host of enemies.<br>
<br>
Walking over, the boy found his cigs and put one in his mouth. The lighter flicked open and the cancer stick was lit. The only sound that pierced the quiet was that of the baby Taylee held in her arms. George rolled his eyes. First that vamp causes him to break a leg, then he finds his way to a city run by people just like him, and now he's stuck with a ghoul and a child that's most likely a dhampire.

It was a voice I was unfamiler with having not met anyone earlier that posessed it but I knew George and Taylee had to be pretty far gone now to hear it. But if they did and turned back then I would be in waiting for them. But right now I had more issues to worry about such as these approaching wolve men.<br>
<br>
Their eyes glittered in the semi darkness as they came into view, their hairy bodies carrying the stench of the sewers that had matted into their fur. I had never met any before but from the rumors I heard they were helping the humans against the vampires. The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>were</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> creatures were probably the only hope the pathetic humans had anyway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lost are we?&quot; growled a very large and towering wolf man as he talked right up into my face and stood his full height. &quot;Such a pretty thing down here is a rare sight... you must be looking for something. Be it us or not, you have been found.&quot; his voice was deep as he continued as his eyes traveled all over me. I knew I had to play this one cool so I slowly clicked back my swords and moved my hands away from my guns. I was outnumbered twenty to one from what I could see.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lost? No... I am a vampire hunter and have been tracking one through here that stole away a poor girl and her baby.&quot; I replied in a soft voice as I locked my eyes right up into his steady gaze. &quot;He is a tricky fellow and I can only hope you do not hold me up long so I can free the girl.&quot; my body moved in a slightly seductive manner as I acted with sincerity I did not really have.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vampires... Those pieces of shit!&quot; snapped one of the other <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>were</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> creatures from the shadows. &quot;Always thinking they can do anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes... they do don't they... now can I please continue on?&quot; I caused my voice to tremble as I forced myself to place my hand on the leader's greasy fur and stroked it softly. <br>
<br>
His thick hands wrapped around my waist in an instant, holding me tight and I fought my nature to attack my way out. I had to be careful here for these creatures could turn into temporary allies. &quot;We will help you my little lady.&quot; he grinned with sharp teeth as I moved my head so his saliva missed my face and fell with a slimy caress upon the top of my left breast. &quot;But you have come across our territory so for that you must pay us a traveling fee.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Traveling fee?&quot; I leaned back as best I could from his hairy chest. I was beginning to get very uncomfortable with were this was beginning to turn. &quot;I'm a hunter... killing your enemy and you do this to me?&quot; I fought back the urge to snap my fangs at him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I will do as I wish with you for though you kill our sworn enemy, you yourself are not completely human either. So since we hate all things vampire including half vampires, you will treat me to a trick before we help you capture this vampire and we will help you kill him.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Shit this was not what I had in mind at all... I wanted them to help me outta here but they are on to me... Well sorta but what will they do when they find out George is human? Wait a minute this is perfect, he will naturally fight back being the dumb ass that he is and I'll get outta there before these hairy monsters knows it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I thought to myself as I tried to ignore what I was feeling rising up from between his legs.<br>
<br>
&quot;You... gotta be shitting me.&quot; my eyes narrowed as I looked back up onto his face. &quot;Traveling fee is... want me to fuck you?&quot; I hissed with my fangs flashing now. &quot;Get that... huge gross... sticky thing away from me!&quot; I struggled harder in his arms and managed to wiggle free. &quot;I'm sure we can come up with some sorta compromise right? We're both after the same thing here are we not? I can not help it who I am, I did not choose to be a dhampire.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was instantly grabbed and over powered by three of his companions and held before him as he sneered down at me. &quot;You are the one that does not understand... we will help you, risking our own lives for you. For that you owe me a favor.&quot; he dragged his tongue across the tops of my breasts. &quot;Its either I put my huge gross sticky thing as you so called it into your mouth and shut you up or... you accept what I would rather do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is fucking sick. I don't do animals!&quot; I snarled back at him, forgetting and no longer caring about trying to get their help now. I was ready to kill every last one of them if only I could get my damn arms free from their grasp. I also realised very quickly that using the term &quot;animal&quot; was a huge mistake. It felt like I was outside of my body for I was no longer in control of it as I was held by the three behind me. Against my will my legs were undressed and parted as I was held horizontal and about waist high. &quot;You'll pay for this I so fucking SWEAR!&quot; I thrashed about vainly as their leader moved between my legs. Blood tricked from my lips as I gritted my teeth and closed my eyes when I felt my womanhood violated by his very large sweaty length. I do not know if it was from the pain or from the intermittant lose of conscienceness that I had but their voices became distant as I passed out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~ ~ Some Time Later ~ ~</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Zabian... looks like she is coming around...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Man you made her pass out... wonder how she feels... to bad she won't know how long you fucked her...&quot; voices rang dimly in my head as I slowly came to. My eyes struggled open only to view blurry images and there was a pain deep in my stomach between my legs. Oh that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>were</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> leader was going to die, that stupid piece of shit that he was. I had never been raped since I was twelve years old and that was when I had learned of what I was. Death had met the men shortly afterwards from my hands and I was already planning the fate of these creatures.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are here sweet little woman.&quot; smirked one of them as I curled up into a ball and surprised by the fact I still had all my weapons. &quot;We followed the trail you were on once Zabian was done with you... we believe the vampire is in that building.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly I struggled to my feet as the feeling of sickness washed away. I shook my head to free myself of the cobwebs and looked towards a building with steel inforced windows and door. Zabian stood over by the door and I could see them playing with what appeared to be a door code device. I could only trust that I really was at the right place since I had been out for the remainder of the trip here. I knew George had to have some sort of protection about the place if this was really his home but I did not bother warning the others. They were to eager to get the &quot;vampire&quot; to even notice as I snapped my swords into place.<br>
<br>
Thats when the ground shook as a loud explosion and blast came from the building. Before my very eyes I watched Zabian blow apart as the rest of his followers dove for cover behind and scatter like a flock of chickens. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That couldn't have been more perfect HAHA</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I smirked as I quickly limped towards the door and through the smoke before collapsing onto the floor midst the rubble just inside the building. What I had been through in Zabian's hands had taken a toll on my legs and I could hardly walk but if George was really in here and really wanted to fight, I would go out with a blaze of swords and guns. Of course if he was in here and left me alone, I would be grateful enough to not attack him as previously planned.<br>

Or perhaps you wanted to go with that stupid redhead, or Devereax?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The words echoed through Taylee's mind as she stood looking at him open mouthed. How could he think his actions were justified...or that she would have even considered going with either of them.<br>
<br>
She was about to say more to George when he moved away from her limping across the room to light a cigarette. As he finished she heard him say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;This thing is gonna kill me.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Not soon enough,&quot; she grumbled under her breath just before all hell broke loose. Suddenly it seemed that the world was exploding around them and as a shower of debris fell around her, Taylee crawled over to sheild the now wailing child. <br>
<br>
After a few moments, coughing up dust, Taylee raised her head to look fearfully around. Seeing something moving slowly through the cloud of dust, Taylee hunched down hoping Cale hadn't found them. Abruptly, the figure became clear through the haze and Taylee recoginized the matted red hair. 'Not again' Taylee thought, just before the girl collapsed to the floor amid the rubble. <br>
<br>
With a swift glance to make sure both George and the child wern't hurt, Taylee jumped up and picked her way to the fallen dhampire, then bending down she could see the girl was hurt. &quot;Rayne?&quot; she gasped, &quot;Oh God, what happened to you?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/13/03 9:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> This could get interesting</span><hr size=1> George had been about to reply to Taylee's remark when his door bomb blew. Thankfully he had rigged it as best he could to blow mainly outward, killing the ones closest to it, and knocking most within a ten yard radius off their feet. It was not a perfect bomb by any means as George soon found out when the backwards force was enough to break the hinges on the door, sending it back into his hideout.<br>
<br>
The result stired up a dust cloud, from which the red headed dhampire immerged. Out of sheer reflex the revolvers appeared in George's hands. The reason he did not open fire immediatly eluded him, but what ever reason, in the seconds that he paused, George noticed that Rayne's walk resembled the aftershock of being close to an explosion. That meant she wasn't in the explosion. Someone else blew the bomb.<br>
<br>
Maybe it was Taylee's influence, or maybe he was getting soft in his old age, but not only did George not fire, he also holstered his guns and grabbed Rayne to pull her into the hideout. &quot;Have a seat,&quot; he told her as he reached for the metal baracade he kept to the side after a group of vamps busted his door in a few months back. That incident was what made up his mind to install the door bomb.<br>
<br>
Once it was in place, George placed braces on the baracade to insure that it couldn't be broken into by the normal sort of vamps that live around there.<br>
<br>

Like I was fucking going anywhere to begin with. I was inside like I wanted to be but for some reason now my plans were changing. George's gun had been seen by my eyes for my senses were in tact, it was just my body that was weak. He had helped me though, why I cound not imagine. And Taylee's own concern confused me somewhat as well.<br>
<br>
With a little bit of difficulty I managed to struggle up into the chair, my legs feeling like jelly and an aching pain in my stomach. I did not know how long I had been out or how long they had raped me but it was an experience I wanted to forget had ever happened. My pride had been broken by their actions and I swore revenge on every last one of them.<br>
<br>
I wiped the dirt and dried blood from my face as my intense eyes looked to Taylee as George set about arming the place up again. There was no way I could tell her what had happened to me so I decided to make up something that could explain the reason for the attack. It was obvious by George's own demands that he had no clue as to what had happened either so I quickly made something up.<br>
<br>
&quot;No... I am not alright can't you see? I can barely walk.&quot; I began slowly, my eyes drifting from Taylee to George and back again. &quot;When you took off, I had to leave to cause come on I could take you on in a second but all those vampires would be suicide. Anyway I was headed through the sewers when I met up with some Were Wolves who were tracking you also.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess the sight of a man dragging a woman through the sewers made you look like a vampire...&quot; I glanced at George as I continued. &quot;They took me hostage with them and ended up outside your door. I resisted all the way cause well no one makes me do anything and they roughed me up a little. I was not much of a match against the thirty of them. Thankfully I was able to get somewhat away when the explosion took place... god I'd hate to be a sales person around here...&quot; I finished the revised version of my story. I still felt very sick and I just wanted to bath to get everything out of me. I also felt like I was going to get sick and I coughed with my hand over my mouth as I tried to regain control. What I really needed was some blood but this was not the right time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

Taylee saw the obvious revulsion as Rayne came to the part about the werewolves abducting her.<br>
<br>
When her story came to an end George already moved away to try to fix what the explosion had ripped apart and Taylee, who had remained quiet this whole time saw Rayne looking her in the eye. &quot;Well I think you need to get cleaned up?&quot; Taylee said looking at the blood and grime that streaked Rayne's face and clothes. &quot;I'll find out from wonder boy over there,&quot; Taylee said not yet willing to forgive what George had done earlier as she gestured toward where he was working, &quot;where we can find a bathroom around here.&quot; <br>
<br>
Taylee turned and began to walk away, thinking about what Rayne had told her....it's not that she didn't believe the other girl...but there was something missing...something about the way she was hurt that Taylee recoginized from her own dark past. And if what Taylee suspected it was she knew Rayne wouldn't mention it in front of George.<br>
<br>
Stopping close to where he worked, Taylee spoke, &quot;Um...George...is there somewhere I can take Rayne to get cleaned up?

<br>
Taylee shrugged at the redhead before saying, &quot;Come on, I think we can find something to get you cleaned up....but it might take awhile for some water to heat up.&quot; As she led the way, she mumbled in a voice only Rayne was sure to pick up, &quot;No running water?

The idea of bathing from a bucket was not a pleasing thought for I wanted to have water run all down my body to wash off the filth but that was not happening tonight. And Wal-Mart shampoo? Fuck couldn't a guy provide a little better if he wanted to house and protect a girl? <br>
<br>
I said nothing though of my discontent as I struggled on weak knees after Taylee. It seemed by her under-breath comments she was not to keen on the idea either and I had to grin a little with a show of my fangs. At least it seemed she was not taking it to personally that I had wanted her blood earler and I had a feeling maybe she had not bought my whole story. Only a woman or a gay man might have caught on that I was holding something back. A light was welcome so on my way to the shower room I took with me a lanturn with me for I was not about to let George bring one and see me in the pathetic state I was about to put myself into.<br>
<br>
The shower room was definatly a low in my bathing experience for I was used to running water at least. The lanturn was set on the floor as I leaned against the wall and closed the door behind Taylee and myself. &quot;I can't believe a guy would want to shelter a lovely girl like you in his home if this was all he could provide...&quot; I sighed as I sank down to the floor, my gaze landing on the stove that was to heat the water. &quot;I mean what am I to bath in? I see no tub... must I stand naked over a bucket and bath?&quot; the tiredness in my voice apparent.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what I really do not understand... is why are you helping me?&quot; my dark eyes looked intently into hers as we were alone in the dim light room behind a closed door. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

She listened to the redhead talking as she straitened up looking for the matches she would need to light the gas. She had just spotted them and reached forward as she heard Rayne's last statement, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;And what I really do not understand... is why are you helping me?&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Taylee turned on the gas and digging a single stick out of the box struck it along the side, watching as it flared to life before putting it to the burner. With a whoosh the flame caught the gas, and at last Taylee turned to the girl sitting limply on the floor. &quot;You know what, Rayne...neither do I. But I am...so maybe we can try to get along, at least for now?&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned and began dragging a bucket over close to the stove. When it was where she wanted it she poured some of the water into a large pan that George must have left for this purpose. Once the water was on the stove, Taylee turned again to see that Rayne had not moved, &quot;So do you want to tell me the unedited version?&quot; She moved over and sat down beside the other girl. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/19/03 7:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home Sweet Home</span><hr size=1> &quot;I got no problem with getting along with you.&quot; I sighed almost under breath as I watched Taylee prepare the water to be heated. &quot;Its that nosy prick outside... but I should be thankful enough he is letting me use his Wal-Mart shampoo...&quot; the sarcasim dripped with a hint of jest in my voice.<br>
<br>
My eyes followed Taylee as she sat down beside me, closer then I expected her to. And since she had no idea why she was helping me, I was even more confused. Most people had a reason to help someone, I know I did only if there was some sort of profit. Maybe she was different, I could not tell so I remained a little cautious just in case.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you want to know what really happened to me.&quot; I lowered my head as I ran my hands down my stomach slowly, my legs tucked indian style before me. &quot;I'd ask what makes you think there was something else but I know your a smart girl... Well dumb enough to become a cursed ghoul but your a lovely girl...&quot; I became lost in thought as I tried to keep back my insult when I was trying to praise her. A curse of mine to say the least is I was not used to trying to be grateful or nice and right now I had to with her.<br>
<br>
MY voice became husky, so low only she could hear me as I was practicly leaning against her shoulder wearily and whispering in her ear. &quot;Pretty much everything happened as I said... But your a smart girl... figure it out... fucking weres...&quot; I cursed them as I removed my blades from my arms and set them beside me. I was not prepared to go fully disarmed in here with George out there. I was sure he wanted a piece of me, to kill me if he could while I was weak. On second thought I was not prepared to use that shampoo since I really did not know what was in the bottle. And if he used it for certain things then I would be safer staying away from it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll tell you a little bit more about me when we have a little more privacy... Right now my pride is stinging and I'm going to have to be vulnerable in this damn setting in order to bath...&quot; The thought of having to go nude here was not to bad for I could handle Taylee here but George was not going to see me like this.

The blonde pulled herself back to her feet and shrugged off her wet coat, before moving back over to take a look at the water on the stove. Then she turned to look at the girl across the room, &quot;As for George, he's not all bad...not that I've forgiven him for what he did back there but....&quot; She shrugged. &quot;I guess he was trying to get us out of that situation.&quot; <br>

Taylee didn't press Rayne for anymore details about her ordeal with the were's.

We would have been in a place with decent furnishings if she had decided to risk going with me but the less dangerious option landed both of us here. And I was not about to blame myself for this whole mess I was in, oh no I blamed George for not minding his fucking business back at the park.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look... if you really wanted to save someone would you risk their trust and bluff their life in order to?&quot; I replied at length though there was no hostility in my voice. &quot;No you'd fucking risk your own instead...&quot; my eyes watched her move about the kitchen and check on the water upon the stove. The water was taking forever to warm up but that was fine, I was taking this time to recover from my ordeal from earlier. Her final question made me look up however as I finished unstrapping the last of my weapons and placing them by my side.<br>
<br>
&quot;No... you may stay... Do you really think I'd mind if you happened to look upon me? Come on I kill and drink the blood from pieces of flesh as living... showing a little nudity to a girl who has the same things I do is not a problem.&quot; I smiled weakly before looking away quickly so she would hopefully not see the first non-hostile smile I had done in a while. Fuck me... being raped by weres had really screwed with my mentality. &quot;Besides I need someone to make sure George doesn't come walking in here...&quot;<br>

<br>
Taylee didn't know why she was defending George after he had scared the hell out of her earlier but right now she didn't want to look at it too closely, afraid of what she might discover. <br>
<br>
Pacing over to the stove again, Taylee was surprised by Rayne's next question, and turned to face the redhead slowly. &quot;Have you looked at this city lately? It's not exactly safe for us humans anymore.&quot; She paced back across the room and leaned against the wall, not far from Rayne. &quot;I got caught by some Vamps and they must have been bored because instead of just killing me, they decided it would be more fun to play games,&quot; <br>
<br>
Taylee sighed as she remembered that night, &quot;But it must have been my lucky day, because they happened to be indebted to this powerful Vampire, Carson. When they met with him, they made sure to bring me, their prize, along, and to make a long story short.....he offered me his protection. At the time I had no idea that he would ghoul me. I didn't even know what a ghoul was. So I guess you could say I was dumb.&quot;   <br>

Flash backs of my own past when I discovered who I was as well as what had just happened to me but an hour ago reminded me that Taylee and I were not all that different. Both of us had things happen to us beyond our control which had educated us in things we cared not to know about. In her case she got off fairly lucky compared to myself, and not that I blamed my upbringing with who I was not but it certainly played a part.<br>
<br>
&quot;This world on a whole is not safe period...&quot; my tone was softer as I reached my hands behind my head and tied back my shoulder length red hair. &quot;I have been around a lot longer then you have... and nothing I have seen indicates humans are save from eachother infact. And you and I are not so different...&quot;<br>
<br>
I made my way towards her by the stove, my legs feeling a lot more steady now that I had rested a little bit. &quot;You learned about ghouls from vampires who used you as a toy, something to amuse them. But I... I learned about sex, rape and dhampires all in one painful night. When you were twelve, I bet you played with barbie with your friends. I on the other hand could not figure out why soldiers broke into our house, killed my brothers and then undressed my mother and I in the bedroom. I can still hear her begging them to leave me alone... Imagine... trying to figure out why grown men are lying you down on the bed and then trying to figure out why the fuck they are putting themselves into you the most painful fashion until they cum inside you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I sighed deeply as I touched the warm water with my finger to test its warmth. &quot;Of course I know now... but innocence was stripped from me as they all took me long after I had passed out from pain. I woke up next to my mother who never did wake up when I called to her... fucking bastards! I felt an anger burn through me, giving me power beyond anything I felt possible... I had fangs in my mouth and such a hatred in my heart that I hunted down the last of those men and killed them all. Their blood fueled me on...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My life has been a shit hole... War, misery and conflict were my parents. I learned who I was from my real father when he came back from the war. I've had no respect for humans or vampires since then... I hunt vampires but fuck with humans, they are no better...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe you can make me see something in humanity thats worth saving but I have been through two world wars and now this...&quot; I slipped the top of my leather clothes down to my waist, revealing myself with no remorse or shame to Taylee. &quot;But humans and vampires made me this way...

There were things that the blonde girl would have liked to ask about dhamipres but she figured that could wait until some other time. Catching that thought, Taylee was surprised that she was even contemplating that she would be around the dhampire for any length of time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shit,&quot; Taylee sighed, &quot;What is living forever worth if it's all like that.&quot; She shook her head lost in thought for a moment, before Rayne's movements caused her to look over at the girl.<br>
<br>
Rayne had shrugged off her top and stood bare from the waist up. It wasn't the nudity that caused Taylee to stare at the girl, but the bruises and scratches that mottled her skin. &quot;Christ Rayne, it's no wonder....that you hate everything.&quot; Taylee sighed again, &quot;As for finding anything worth saving...I don't know if there is.&quot; Taylee looked away, letting her eyes sweep the room, &quot;Let me see if there is some sort of tub or something you can at least use,&quot; she said opening a closet door. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=midnightrayne>Midnight Rayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Blood</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#8B4513>(9/27/03 4:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkalaberiafrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://forumshomepage.homestead.com/files/midnightrayne.jpg height=200 WIDTH=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Home Sweet Home</span><hr size=1> Taylee's comments caused me to look down at myself and I sucked in my breath sharply as I caught sight of my bruises and scrapes. &quot;Fucking Were'sss...&quot; I hissed as I carefully examined my upper body. I had not felt or noticed these marks and I was realising it was a safe bet to think those creatures had taken off all my clothes or had at least opened my top. &quot;Ohh... that does it... once I am better its war on those pieces of shit.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was no need to get all angry and scare Taylee right now so I forced myself to be calm. Energy wasted on anger right now was not wise either and I needed all the strength I could to recover. These bruises and scratches would be gone by morning most likely for they were only surface wounds. <br>
<br>
&quot;You know... its not like I decided one day I wanted to live forever and witness a world of pathetic shit we have today. I was quite content growing up a famer's daughter, dreaming of marrying the perfect husband and raising a family... dying a nice ripe old age at the end of a fullfilling life. But humanity's greed, selfish desires for powe and wealth lead to war and suffering. Everything I am now is a product of that... everyone that dies because of me should blame their forfathers for not minding their own fucking business...&quot; the contempt in my voice was more then obvious. &quot;You'd think I would try and make this world a better place... but oddly enough I want to make it hell for them to open their eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
I became silent, relaxed as I carefully removed the rest of my clothes and placed them next to my weapons. My legs had bruises and scratches as well and my womanhood felt like it had been pounded with a 2 x 4. Each step was a numbing throb like when my virginity had been taken by twenty hungry men. The dim light hid the white dried substance on my inner thighs and I bent down with a silent curse and rubbed it off with my hands. The next were I came across was going to get his cock cut off and shoved down his throat before I chopped off his head. Maybe even worse, I'd tie one up and cut off all his friend's cocks and shove them all down his throat and I'd watch him die from suffication. Oh yes revenge would be bloody and sweet. &quot;I'm a hater, not a forgiver and even you can not grasp what I am going to do to these weres...&quot; I whispered to Taylee as I stood naked before her while she looked for something I could bath in.<br>
<br>
&quot;And... if there is something good in humanity... which I highly doubt.&quot; I continued. &quot;It just might be you... If I was in your shoes I would have killed me by now... but you help me and for that I won't forget.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silent Beauty

Taylee had finally found what she was looking for and had just reached in to grab the metal tub when she heard Rayne's last statement. With a snort, she turned around to face the girl, &quot;Well your not in my shoes...I don't go around killing every one I meet. Besides you've given me no reason to want you dead...sure you wanted to take my blood, but it didn't happen. And even though I don't totally trust you...I can see how much you're suffering...and of course I have to help.&quot; <br>
<br>
Taylee put the tub down on the floor, looking at it for a moment before shrugging, &quot;This will have to do. I think it's big enough to sit in....let me just put some water in it first...&quot; she turned towards the stove, &quot;As for me being the one of the only good things left in humanity...don't kid yourself or me...I'm certainly not a saint,&quot; Taylee turned back to where Rayne could see the smirk on her face, as she began to pour the hot water in the tub.<br>
