<br>
The outstretched index finger provides for an accurate and/or close in delicate casting type grip.  I presume the knuckle thing is the crooked index finger on the bottom of the grip with thumb opposing which provides a more powerful grip.  The &quot;v&quot; grip or what I think of as a racquet type grip provides additional power and a stronger wrist movement.  I've used this grip for a long time as it simply feels more natural to me.  The other night I saw it on Paul Ardens &quot;sexyloops&quot; and he explained the increased wrist travel verses the sideways wrist available with this grip.  (Imagine rotating the reel out away from the casting side and using more of a throwing motion with the forearm/wrist.)<br>
<br>
I did feel a little bit vindicated as one of the Master's conducting my certification test chided me about my &quot;eccentricity&quot; concerning my grip as used for the longer casts.  He suggested that it was unorthodox and might mess up a beginning student and that I should stick to the thumb on top throughout the stroke.  What say you?<br>

<br>
On occasion for short accuracy casts it might be beneficial to use a key grip which allows the wrist bones to lay back allowing for the stroke to track in a striaghter line. For any long casting you'd have to have a very strong wrist to keep a cast in plane with this grip. About the only one I know that can keep it together is Andrew with that grip.<br>
<br>
The finger grip, split finger grip, toe on your forehead grip, thumb in your ear grip, etc, are all pretty much just a variation of the two basic grips, thumb on top and key grip.<br>

Ok, thumb on top.<br>
<br>
This is what I have been trying to do for the past six months.  This evening I was out in the yard with a twenty year old 8½' 5wt IM6 working on my double haul.  I was thinking THUMB ON TOP because of what the Master said, so I was surprised to see the V making it's appearance.<br>
<br>
Now, the hauling was going nicely and I was always in the 75 to 82 foot range with an average of 78 or 79.  (The area is measured for accurate feedback and my casting pleasure!)  This was easy casting in my work slacks and dress shirt and shoes, not &quot;tearing your underwear&quot; gorilla casting.  But I was constantly having to correct the right hand.  <br>
<br>
By the way, has anyone noticed that distance casting is addictive as hell?  Even if it's only 80 feet with a 5wt?  You know the tightly wound kinky line down there around 90 feet on your spool that rarely sees the light of day?  It makes this chattering noise as it goes through the guides.  Very cool.<br>
<br>
I will persevere...<br>

<br>
Notice what your hand does at the stop in your back cast. Is your stop &quot;prior&quot; to your hand opening up? When your reel points out your tip is going to swing with it. &quot;Some&quot; people (not me) use a V grip when distance casting because it lengthens their stroke slightly. It allows your hand to travel slightly longer through the power application before opening up. Personally my hand is not strong enough to keep everything on track. I prefer a more &quot;compact&quot; stroke that although may be less powerfull, stays on track.<br>

What I have been trying to do this past summer was to convert to the key grip style of thumb on top.  What happens is that I slip into the V style by rotating the reel out, throughout the stroke both forward and back when going for extra distance.  It's an unconcious thing and is what the Master noticed during my distance casts.  <br>
<br>
So, during my practice session I was trying to keep the key grip thumb on top but was surprised to find that I was seeing the V at different times in the stroke.  I was in fact seeing the bloody ell, and for the exact reasons that you stated.  Rotating the reel out at different times during the stroke rather than THROUGHOUT the stroke was kicking the tip over and changing my backcast from the 180.  The strange part was watching the ell going sideways and eating distance on a cast that in other respects was pretty decent.<br>
<br>
In further developments, I realized today that while I can easily &quot;carry&quot; 60-65' with the 5wt on the forward cast, I don't do worth a damn with it on the backcast.  That means that in truth I can only carry 50-55', doesn't it?  With a 50' backcast, I can easily reach 80' on my presentation cast.  With a 60' backcast, I will usually fall just short of 80'.  That wouldn't have made any sense to me a year ago.  So, more work on the backcast which is where most of our casting problems originate in the first place right?<br>
<br>
Still at it,<br>

<br>
Exactly.......<br>
<br>
I experimented some with the V grip for accuracy. It feels a little more natural to do it that way because your bones naturally flow in a straight line. However, when you start to apply power it is a little harder to keep it in track, even if you start with the V grip. I'm not positive but I think Drew uses a V grip often when he is turned to the side and making long sweeping drifts with the rod. However, he &quot;does&quot; keep things &quot;in track&quot;.<br>
<br>
Gene, the next time you go out to cast try some experimentation with your grip and where your drift ends. By this I mean start facing forward with a closed stance. Feet side by side facing forward. Try a thumb on top grip and begin making your drift go farther and farther back. Try doing a &quot;Lefty&quot; drift where your hand finally reaches way back and your body &quot;has&quot; to turn to reach it. Notice what your hand is doing while you make that drift. <br>
<br>
Then on the next &quot;extreme&quot; turn your body 90 degrees sideways to the target. Use a V grip and make as long of a drift as you possibly can. See if you can keep it on track. See how much power you can apply.<br>
<br>
These are both examples of &quot;style&quot; and have little to do with how the cast will perform. If you are 6'-4&quot; 255 like Drew you can probably handle the rod with 2 fingers and keep it in track. He has a total stroke length of probably 30 feet. However, if you are actually &quot;human&quot; you might find more power comes from a short compact stroke that stays in track. <br>
<br>
My personal preference to have a slightly open stance with my feet at about 45 degrees. While we were at the Denver AFFTA show there were hundreds of people casting rods off the casting platforms. You were almost shoulder to shoulder. I had to stand with my feet &quot;together&quot; facing forward, the rod totally upright, and make the fly pass just off my right ear. In other words I had about a 6 foot alley to cast in without hitting someone else. I was suprised that I could still throw in excess of 100 feet with a &quot;very&quot; compact casting stroke. Of course I'm sure that the Denver altitude has something to do with it, but I'm still convinced that tracking adds more power than most people realize.<br>
