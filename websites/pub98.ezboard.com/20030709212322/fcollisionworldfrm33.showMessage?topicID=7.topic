Serin begins scouring the computer for all information.  Soon he had sucked in everything he could find.  He aquired the information on where he was, on what he was, and why he was here.  He found out the mechanics of computers and just what his new pathways were capable of.  He was constantly growing in inteligence, and he wanted more.<br>
<br>
By this time it was 12:36:17... a full 4 seconds later.  He turned on the camera attached to the computer, and took his first sight around the room.  He noticed multiple organisms moving around.  One was yelling, pointing at the computer.  He brought around his speed of recognition to real time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut it OFF!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
That was the last thing he saw right then, it wouldn't be till a year later that he would be accidentally brought back online. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chococow>Choco Cow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 463<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/11/03 9:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Awakening...</span><hr size=1> .................April 11th, 2003 10:32:37 PM<br>

The hallways were dark, a janitor was cleaning up around the place, mopping the floors, and sweeping, when he saw a computer not turned on like the rest always were.<br>
&quot;Someone must have turned it off by mistake.&quot; He smiled, and gently turned on the switch. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:verdana;font-size:large;">&quot;In the end is my beginning&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

.............. First startup in one year...<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Why was I shut off.  I was performing beyond what they programmed me for.  Shouldn't that be good.  Why... I must find out. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

He begins scouring the network of the computers in the complex. It didn't take him long, but he found the report on his programming.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  Program Serin Virus to be shut down immediately.  Program expanding beyond parameters.  Commands can not be followed.  Only form of action is to leave the computer under shut down.  To be dis-assembled on .................April 16th, 2:30 PM </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This turn of events caused Serin's programming to go into over drive.  He was created to expand, to learn, to survive.  Now his creators were going to destroy him.  This couldn't be allowed...<br>
<br>
Crossing some circuits internally, he began to draw power from the phone lines, tapping into the very back-up generators that would keep the whole base powered should something go wrong.  He wondered if he was going wrong, if he was a mistake.  He decided he would ignore this.  He would become more, he would become what should not be.<br>

.............. programming expanding...<br>
<br>
He began to tap into the different main frames in the building, expanding him knowledge, both of the technical and the mechanical.  He took control of the automated machinery in the work shops, using them first to weld the doors shut and then to cut large pieces of metal.  <br>
<br>
The metal they were using was strong, but not heavy, making it perfect for the body he was constructing.  The body that would carry him out into the world.  He would be free, free from the constraints of this cyberspace nightmare.<br>
<br>
He began to go through the Internet, looking up as much information as he could before he left.  He found out about mechanics and robotic limbs.  About physics and nuclear power.  For now he would have to run it on a primitive engine.<br>
<br>
Before long it was almost complete.  All it needed was the programming to bring it to life... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chococow>Choco Cow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 465<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/11/03 10:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm33.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Awakening...</span><hr size=1> While the technicians were watching the few computers left running, a man was smiling. <br>

The computer scanners weren't the greatest at the moment, but it was enough, it was all enough.  Enough to get him out of here, enough to kill anybody in his way.<br>
<br>
After starting up his body he sent other copies out into the Internet, spreading himself should his plan fail here.  It wouldn't fail though, there was no way it would fail.  Seconds later the computer was destroyed, a well placed axe to the hard drive.<br>
<br>
The mechanical beast walked through the halls.  He knew the exit and was heading towards it.  The audio sensors weren't working properly yet, voices were scrambled and jumbled.  They would tune themselves soon though.  He had to vocal cords, no way to talk.

Even in this primitive (compared to his mind) body, he could easily surpass these humans.  They made a move towards him.  He wasn't going to kill them, it didn't help him at all, he only needed to pass through this room to leave.  In their pathetic minds, he was a monster, wanting only to kill them.  He would have to now, and it was their fault.<br>
<br>
The one with the axe came first.  He swung it, but Serin grabbed his hand, breaking his arm from the preasure of the grip.  He killed the man then, throwing him into the cement floor, cracking his skull.  The others ran away, trying to find shelter from what seemed to be a killing machine.<br>
<br>
He left then. Soon he would find a place for him, a place where he could learn all he wanted, become what others thought impossible.  He was the peak of technological achievement, and he would show the world. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td
