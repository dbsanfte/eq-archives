Let's see, we have computers with games, nintendo with games, super-nintendo with games, nintendo 64 with games, the nintendo game cube with games, gameboys with games, and gameboy advanced with games.  If that isn't enough, we have DVDs and vcr tapes, we play a modified version of scrabble together since my 2 little ones are 10 and 11, we have books to read, my son is reading The Two Towers right now.  The hardest thing so far is convincing them there's something to do, so I made them clean their rooms! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Darren,<br>
I may be giving some unsolicited advice, but the intentions are good here, ok?<br>
I hear you loud and clear, I breastfed all 3 of mine.  If this is your first baby, and I believe it is?  The best thing I can say is find a way to relax, and find some patience.  I hope and pray both your families are supporting you as well?   If the cough persists get mom to the doctor, please.  Hopefully with a little more time mom will get comfortable with breastfeeding, some do, some don't.  I had trouble at first too, but we had decided it was the best thing for our children.  I've found it was well worth breastfeeding and would not change it.  Oh, and give mom a break when baby is either asleep or awake either one, let her go take a nice hot shower if she isn't able to take baths yet.  You know it's the little things that mean so much at this time, just little considerations that say you love mom and baby both, with lots of encouragement.  I hope you understand? <br>
<br>
Keeping your family in my prayers.<br>
God bless,<br>

HUGS to you and Amy!  Great advice from Von too ....it meant SO much to me to have support when I was breastfeeding my lil' ones.  Is she using <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Lansinoh Lanolin</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?!  sorry if I'm being too personal....but honestly, I don't think I could've continued breastfeeding that first month without this wonderful stuff!!  I was determined to feed my baby this way too...although it wasn't easy at first (whoever those folks are who say, 'why, it's the most natural thing in the world'...don't know what they're talkin' about!)  ...it helped to have a supportive nursing staff at the hospital.  I could call them at any time and get advice ...and believe me, I kept their number hot for several weeks at the beginning of the breastfeeding adventure. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=esdras>esdras</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sir Esdras of the <br>Great White North</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#B87333>(2/19/03 10:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/gsmorgan/images/ADPY005.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ok, I just want to know....</span><hr size=1> For any children aged 2 to 5 (maybe 6) I cannot say enough about the cartoon Max &amp; Ruby.  It is played in Canada on Treehouse TV and I think it is on Nick Jr. in the U.S.<br>
<br>
The cartoon is based on a series of Books by Rosemary Wells (who also does Timothy Goes to School [great for the 4 to 8 age group and also a cartoon] and the book &quot;Read to your Bunny&quot;) and she is an excellent author.<br>
<br>
Max &amp; Ruby is about a brother and sister (rabbits) Ruby being the older and how they interact.  The parents of Max &amp; Ruby are never shown since Rosemary Wells said that she felt it was important for children to learn that they can work out differences peacfully without resorting to calling in an adult.  Each episode reinforces this as Max &amp; Ruby have different plans, yet they always work things out in the end without fighting.<br>
<br>
Timothy Goes to School is about young boy (raccoon) who goes to kindergarten.  The episodes deal with sharing, respecting differences (kids from other cultures), cooperation, etc.<br>
<br>
These shows aren't terribly educational, but they are very entertaining (Max &amp; Ruby has some very subtle and subversive humour that only adults will get) and quite acceptable for Christian children.  The only episode that some may find iffy was a Halloween special.<br>
<br>
My son loves both shows (he's almost 3) and we've taped about 15 (3 cartoons each) episodes since it is a show that we know he enjoys and is suitable as well.  And honestly, my wife and I enjoy them! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

A large number of the Max &amp; Ruby cartoons are taken directly from books, examples include Max's Bedtime, Max's Chocolate Chicken and Bunny Money.  If your child is at the point where they are starting to learn to read it's great to have the book and the cartoon.  Much of the dialogue is identical so it can reinforce what they are seeing in the book. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

Maybe go to a hobby store and find something that would fit for whatever age group your kids are.<br>
<br>
Games are also good.  Again games directed at age.  I love Uno.  Board games are fun too.<br>
<br>
Bake together, kids especially like helping make cookies and other sweets.<br>
<br>
Just play whatever your kids like to play - like dolls, action figures, house, tea party, etc...  Build a fort out of furniture with them.  Just remember what it's like to be a kid.<br>
<br>
If there's snow, build a snowman together. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Get out coloring books and crayons and color together.<br>
<br>
Play play doh together.<br>
<br>
Build a model together.  (Like in model plane, etc...)<br>
<br>
Try avoid the tv, do things that promote your child's creativity and thinking. <p>*******************************************<br>
