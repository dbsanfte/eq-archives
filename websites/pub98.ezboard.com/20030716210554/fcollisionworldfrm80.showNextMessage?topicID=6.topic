Fortunately the tree-tops were thick enough to keep most of the rain out... but it was rather dark.<br>
<br>
&quot;Umm...&quot; Kirin quietly whispered... very uncertain to this now.<br>
She kept thinking that he might... do something bad to her...<br>
<br>
But then again... she felt she could trust him. For some odd reason she thought she saw something past the cold dark man Enari was appearing to be.<br>
<br>
Enari's mind was almost black... he knew what he had to do and that he must do it...<br>
<br>
ENari stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um...&quot; Kirin said again... looking at Enari as he turned around.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to tell you something.&quot; His cold glare was directed towards her now.<br>
<br>
Kirin stared at him with puzzlement.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've been having dreams lately...&quot; He said with his deep, almost seductive voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you know?&quot; Kirin was very surprised to hear what he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;THose are prophecies... you have... special powers.&quot; He continued to look at her, crossing his arms.<br>
<br>
Kirin's face turned a little paler... her arms were now wrapped around her body she was so cold.<br>
THe thick tendrils that hung on each side of her face were now stuck to her cheeks... <br>
<br>
&quot;You also have the ability to use elements.. and heal.&quot; He walked up next to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I...I...&quot; is all Kirin managed to say out of shock.<br>
<br>
His face got less than a foot away from her... it showed interest and deception... a wickdly satisfied look came across his face as he looked directly into her eyes.<br>
<br>
Her face was now very frightened... she knew that it was to late to turn back.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are an ancient... my master needs you.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;You're reading the crappy map wrong! It's this way!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, gimme that!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't trust you with maps, Seifer.  You can't read directions for squat.&quot;<br>
<br>
Two voices loudly argued, traveling through the dark, misty woods.  One voice belonged to a young woman with a backpack of odd and dangerous items, with poison green eyes and dark red hair, and the other belonged to a tall, broad man with blonde hair and crystalline blue eyes.  They fought playfully over the map, and finally Eris held victor, grabbing it from behind Seifer's back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Got it! Now let's see...&quot; Eris' eyes went over the foreign symbols on the map and grinned. &quot;This way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Seifer asked skeptically, smiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course I'm sure.  I'm always right about these things.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know...&quot; he shrugged.  &quot;There was just last night, when...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, hey! That *wasn't* my fault.  We had no idea those basilisks would be so hostile.  No one could have predicted it.  It was fate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kind of like being stuck with you,&quot; he chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, yeah...&quot;  she lead the way, stepping quietly over the dead leaves and fallen limbs.  But suddenly, Seifer grabbed her shoulder and pulled her back, grasping her bodily as he hid both of them behind the trunk of a tree.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey! What's the--&quot;<br>
<br>
Seifer clapped his hand over the young woman's lips.  &quot;Shh...listen...&quot;<br>
<br>
Eris stood quietly in Seifer's grasp, listening hard. She swore to Firadra's frill, Seifer had the ears of a dog.<br>
<br>
Then she heard them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Those are prophecies... you have... special powers...You also have the ability to use elements.. and heal....&quot; came the deep, seductive voice of a man.<br>
<br>
&quot;I...I...&quot; came the frightened voice of a young woman.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't like this, Seif,&quot; Eris whispered.  &quot;She sounds like she's in trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do we do?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
They were interrupted when they both heard the man say,<br>
<br>
&quot;You are an ancient... my master needs you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eris and Seifer exchanged glances and nodded decisively.  &quot;Attack,&quot; they both said at the same time.<br>
<br>
They leapt into the clearing where they found a very intimidating looking man standing menacingly before a young woman in distress.<br>
<br>
Seifer drew his broadsword, and Eris whipped a scroll from her backpack and drew it open, muttering words under her breath quicker than lightning.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get away from her!&quot; Seifer shouted at the man. <br>
<br>
&quot;...Heressese, nu kana la!&quot; Eris finished the spell, and a wave of magnificent fire burst throughout the clearing, lighting the dark space up as it headed straight for the man named Enari. &quot;Take that, you bastard!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/2/03 1:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm80.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid Map...</span><hr size=1> (actualy you're quite right Eris.. he is a bastard...lol)<br>
<br>
Enari quickly dodged the first wave and drew his two swords (double blades!!! ^_^).... <br>
<br>
Enari smirked as he turned around and a glowing aura surrounded him.... the last bit fire went up in steam as it hit the barrier.<br>
<br>
Kirin was quite shocked... not knowing what to do...so she just stared with big eyes...<br>
<br>
&quot;Foolish humans...&quot; His voice hinted at annoyance as he shook his head.<br>
<br>
The Aura got bigger and bigger... the light becoming almost blinding...<br>

She shielded her eyes against the light with a slender hand.  &quot;Time for plan B, Seif!&quot;<br>
&quot;What's plan B?&quot;<br>
&quot;I thought you knew plan B!&quot; Eris shouted.<br>
&quot;I didn't even know there WAS a plan B!&quot; he retorted.<br>
&quot;Aaah, screw it!&quot;  Eris ran back a bit, dragging Seifer with her, whipping out another obscure looking scroll.  <br>
&quot;Which one is that?&quot; He asked over the aftermath roaring wind from her previous spell colliding with the aura.<br>
&quot;How the hell am I supposed to know!?&quot; she demanded, unrolling it.  &quot;Jira je, jira jai, jira jao, dracosai!!!&quot;<br>
Suddenly a bright purple light overcame the relatively puny aura of Enari, the force of the spell throwing both companions back against the treetrunks.  A static force filled the air, sparks of electricity lacing the purple light.  When the violet aura faded, a mighty, bellowing roar of irritation filled the air, enough to make ears bleed. A huge 50 foot dragon, towering over the treetops, blacks scales gleaming in the lightning, lamplike yellow eyes shining like beacons down at the villain Enari.  It roared at him, razor jaws gleaming with sharpness and dried blood of past meals crusting its gums.<br>
Seifer caught his breath as he gazed up..up...and up at the black dragon.  He was dazed from hitting the tree, but seeing a mighty lizard such as the one stading before him was enough to jolt him back to reality.  He glared at Eris who laid beside him against another tree not too far away, the girl's skin singed with smoky black dust and her red hair standing on end, sparking with static, as his was.<br>
&quot;You summoned...&quot; he breathed contemptuously.  &quot;...A dragon.  Excellent work!&quot; he spat sarcastically.<br>

Kirin looked at Eris... <br>
&quot;um.. ok... where'd that come from? that is amazing!&quot; She said as her eyes lit up with a sort of childish glee.<br>

Enari looked down... for a second... then looked straight up again.<br>
An evil grin came across his face...<br>
<br>
The protective aura that was still around him faded and he stood in a fighting stance... ready to take the dragon on.<br>
<br>
&quot;You think you can defeat me? &quot; He scoffed as he leaped into to air and sliced down at the dragon.<br>
<br>
It did no effect, but instead directed the dragon's attention away from Kirin and Eris.<br>
<br>
He landed behind the dragon and the dragon turned around... the sparks from his nostrils now buzzing with anger.<br>
<br>
Enari leaped again and again, almost tangling the dragon in the trees...<br>
<br>
The dragon roared in frusteration at the small pest.<br>
<br>
It stood up breifly on it's hind legs, trying to get out of the mess he was in... Enari ran up under it and threw his ice sword, Glacier, as hard as he could up into it's chest.<br>

<br>
The ice sword impaled the black dragon, which gave a mighty screech of pain.  But it was not finished.  <br>
<br>
Roaring loudly over the thunder, the thunder dragon's heart gathered all of its power and and conducted it into the ice blade...giving Enari a rather bad shock of about 100,000 volts of power.<br>
<br>
Eris and Kirin watched aweingly as the dragon raised its head to the sky, watching the lightning one last time before it writhed, and finally, slumped down dead, its shadow casting over them as its large body came heading right for them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris!&quot; <br>
<br>
Seifer came streaking out of no where, grabbing both girls which were small and delicate compared to his frame.  They all tumbled to the ground out of the black dragon's path, which slumped dead on the ground seconds after with a sickening crash of trees and breaking stones, right where the two girls had been.  Seifer covered their bodies with his own from the explosion of kicked up dust and soil that surrounded them.<br>
<br>
Then there was silence.  <br>

Seifer then moved off of them, panting in relief.  He glared at Eris, shaking his head.  &quot;You HAD to summon a dragon,&quot; he muttered, gesturing at the dead creature. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spark@collisionworld>Spark</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.cheatingdome.com/forums/attachment.php?s=&postid=65686" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/2/03 11:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm80.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid Map...</span><hr size=1> Kirin's mouth was hanging open out of sepeechlessness...<br>
<br>
She glanced over at the dead dragon and then at Seifer.<br>
Blinking a couple times she looked over where Enari had stood... almost hopeful he had survived.<br>
SHe somehow KNEW he had survived.<br>
<br>
The cloud of dust that had come from the falling dragon started fading as Enari's outline appeared staring through it.<br>
<br>
The dust cleared away and showed Enari, with his back turned to the three. <br>
His hair was pretty frizzed and his stance didn't look happy.<br>
<br>
He turned around and glared at the three.<br>
<br>
&quot;You flithy little bastards...&quot; He muttered... <br>
he had thought his job was going to be a sinch... instead now his powers were weakened greatly and Pheonix wasn't going to be happy with the delay.<br>
<br>
He walked forward a few steps and then said something under his breath.<br>
<br>
The aura same blinding beam of light incircled Enari... but was somewhat weaker than before.<br>
<br>
It widened until it had surrounded Kirin, Eris, and Seifer...<br>

Seifer and the feisty woman struggled to their feet and stood in defense position; back to back, and arms locked as Seifer held his broadsword and Eris whipped out another scroll.  But there seemed no use for either.  Kirin was somewhere near them as they stood back to back, watching the beautiful, horrible light surround them and swallow them whole.<br>
<br>
&quot;I gotta admit Eris,&quot; Seifer gulped.  &quot;This is pretty weird.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We've seen weirder,&quot; Eris nodded, and waited for whatever was going to happen.  She trembled from the force of magic.  She hated magic, though she used it in her scrolls.  But that wasn't pure magic.  Not like this.<br>

Thalia, Willow and Balder walked up, looking around.  Balder sniffed the air, trying to decide where to go next.  Thalia turned upon seeing a strange light...those two people...what were they doing?...<br>
<br>
&quot;...I think we walked in on something,&quot; Willow said, blinking and watching the scene in interest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Balder, look,&quot; Thalia said, staring at the light.  *Odd...I've never seen such magic before...who cast it?*<br>
<br>
He turned, his eyes widening when he saw what they were looking at.  &quot;What is this?...&quot; he mumbled to no one in particular.<br>
<br>
Thalia's green eyes shifted, noticing the other two people standing nearby.  A tall, almost menacing-looking man, and a young girl...<br>
<br>
*Very strange.  Very strange indeed...*<br>
<br>
She jumped up, landing nearby the light surrounding the man and woman.  &quot;God of light, destroy this night!&quot;  She yelled, forming a green energy ball in her hands and throwing it directly at the light.  It looked as though it bounced off, but after a moment, the light disappeared in a flash.  Thalia looked around, checking to see if everyone was alright.  *A rather weak spell, easily broken...but such an odd one.  I've never seen such a thing.*  <br>
<br>
&quot;What...what WAS that?&quot;  Willow asked, a little frightened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who cast that?&quot;  Thalia said loudly so everyone could hear. <p>~Z<br>

&quot;Don't ask me,&quot; Seifer answered the unasked question.  You're the one that dragged us here in the first place.&quot;<br>

<br>
Balder nodded, agreeing.  He drew his sword, walking forward cautiously.  Willow gulped, watching him silently.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Nina burst through the brush and fell down the hill.  She landed on her head, dizzy.  &quot;Ow...&quot; she muttered, getting up and brushing herself off.  She looked up, noticing the other people there in the clearing.  She gasped in glee.  &quot;Thalia!  Balder!  Over here!&quot;  She called, running over to them.<br>
<br>
They looked up in amazement, turning in her direction.  She ran over to Thalia and hugged her legs tightly.  Thalia blinked in surprise.  *Nina?*  She thought to her.  *Thank God!*<br>
<br>
Nina let go and looked around.  &quot;What's...going on, Thalia?&quot;  She asked, her large blue eyes taking in the scene.<br>

*Stay close,* was all Thalia said, putting her slender hand on the girl's shoulder protectively.<br>
