There has been a go-round over atheist ethics vs xian ones, and I wanted to fire up that debate here.  Given the below mentioned Ethical defects of god, how do xians think to claim a higher moral ground?<br>
<br>
Ethical Defects <br>
<br>
According to premise ( 8 ) of the argument, the Bible contains a perfect morality and no ethical defects. But that claim seems incompatible with the fact that God is described in the Bible as killing people for no good reason. We have already mentioned the many children killed in the Great Flood, in Sodom and Gomorrah, and in the ten plagues on Egypt (especially the last). Here are some additional examples of people whom God killed: <br>
<br>
1. A man who refused to impregnate his brother's widow (Ge 38:7-10). <br>
<br>
2. Two men who offered God incense that he had not authorized (Le 10:1-2). <br>
<br>
3. A group of about 300 people who opposed Moses politically (Nu 16:1-35). <br>
<br>
4. Another group of 14,700 who sympathized with the first group (Nu 16:49). <br>
<br>
5. More people who complained about the food and other matters (Nu 21:4-6). <br>
<br>
6. 24,000 more because of some who worshiped Baal (Nu 25:3,9). <br>
<br>
7. The Amorites who besieged Gibeon (Jos 10:10-11). <br>
<br>
8. Seventy men who looked into a box (1Sa 6:19). <br>
<br>
9. Another man who, with good intention, touched the box (2Sa 6:6-7). <br>
<br>
10. A man who refused to use his weapon against another man (1Ki 20:35-36). <br>
<br>
11. Forty-two children who called Elisha &quot;baldy&quot; (2Ki 2:23-24). <br>
<br>
12. 185,000 Assyrian soldiers (2Ki 19:35). <br>
<br>
God also killed all of Pharaoh's horsemen in the Red Sea (Ex 14:26-28 ). He could instead have simply made their horses lame, which would have been far more effective than removing the wheels from the chariots so that the horses had to drag the chariots slowly along the ground (Ex 14:25). That would have also spared the horsemen. <br>
<br>
In addition to killing people directly, God also ordered several people killed (despite his commandment not to kill). Here are some examples of people who died by God's order (and in some cases with God's help): <br>
<br>
1. Three thousand of the Levites' brothers, friends, and neighbors, who had become unruly (Exodus 32:27-28 ). <br>
<br>
2. All the men, women, and children in all seven of the tribes who were the Israelites' neighbors (Dt 2:34, 3:6, 7:1-2,16, 20:16-17). [Some Biblical verses imply that the Israelites numbered 2-3 million, which would make the total population of their neighbors more than 14 million. What God was here ordering, then, if we could go by those verses, was a kind of Holocaust.] <br>
<br>
3. All the men, women, and children of the cities of Jericho, Ai, and dozens more cities and towns (Jos 6:21, 8:24-26, 10:26-42, 11:10-23, 21:44). <br>
<br>
4. All the Amalekites, including children, and even animals (1Sa 15:3,18 ), [where Saul was severely punished for sparing some of them]. <br>
<br>
5. All the members of the house of Ahab and ministers of Baal within Israel, the latter accomplished through deception (2Ki 10:11-25), though approved by God (10:30). <br>
<br>
6. All the citizens of Jerusalem, including children, who did not grieve and lament over sins committed in it (Eze 9:4-6). <br>
<br>
It seems quite unethical for God to order the execution of so many people, whatever their offense might have been, especially in the case of the children, who were presumably innocent. <br>
<br>
Closely related to the above is the extravagant use of capital punishment among God's chosen people. God ordered people put to death for such minor offenses as the following: <br>
<br>
1. Consulting a witch (Le 20:6; Dt 18:11). <br>
<br>
2. Blasphemy or merely having a different religion (Ex 22:20; Le 24:10-23; Dt 13:1-15, 17:2-5, 18:20; Jos 23:7,16; 2Ki 18:40). <br>
<br>
3. Gathering sticks or kindling a fire on the Sabbath (Ex 31:14-15, 35:2-3; Nu 15:32-36). <br>
<br>
4. Eating the wrong food (Ex 12:15,19; Le 3:16-17, 7:22,25-27, 17:10-16). <br>
<br>
5. Being a disrespectful or disobedient child (Le 20:9; Dt 21:18-21). <br>
<br>
It seems unethical to have laws that harsh. The laws of the ancient Israelites are hardly the model of morality that advocates of Dominion Theology (or Reconstructionism) make them out to be. It would have been impressive if the Bible had gone against the prevailing cultural norms and had forbidden slavery and the oppression of women. But it did not do that. The Bible condones slavery. [21] It also contains many rules that are discriminatory against women. [22] It is hard to find anything in the Bible that stands out as ethically noble from our point of view today. <br>
<br>
In addition, according to the Bible, God also deceived people and caused evil. Some examples of that are the following: <br>
<br>
1. He created communication problems between people (Gen, 11:7-9). <br>
<br>
2. He sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and certain citizens for the purpose of vengeance (Judges 9:23-24). <br>
<br>
3. He sent another evil spirit to torment Saul (1Sa 16:14). <br>
<br>
4. He put a lying spirit into the mouths of all his prophets (1Ki 22:22-23). <br>
<br>
5. He admitted creating disaster (&quot;evil&quot; in the KJV) (Isa 45:7). [See also Amos 3:6.] <br>
<br>
6. He permitted people to have &quot;statutes that were not good and laws they could not live by&quot; (Eze 20:25). <br>
<br>
7. He sent certain people a powerful delusion so that they would believe a lie (2Th 2:11). <br>
<br>
God also apparently ordered stealing by having the Israelites plunder the Egyptians (Ex 3:22). He ordered the plundering of cities far away from Israel and the enslavement of their people (Dt 20:10-14). [The seven neighboring tribes were to be dealt with still more harshly, as indicated above.] He also ordered 32,000 female virgins to be taken as war plunder (half to go to the soldiers and half to the people) and 32 of them to be for himself (Nu 31:18-40). All of this is highly unethical, to say the least. <br>
<br>
Even Biblical doctrines are unethical. A good case could be made that Adam and Eve were victims of entrapment and did not deserve their punishment. And the idea that children are born into the world somehow inheriting Adam and Eve's sin also implies an injustice. As for Jesus's alleged sacrifice for humanity, that too seems unethical. If people deserve a certain punishment, then they ought to receive it. That is what justice is. To knowingly punish the innocent is always morally repugnant. Furthermore, the exclusivist threat of &quot;accept Christ or else be damned for eternity&quot; is unethical. People ought to be provided some way of &quot;opting out&quot; of the entire system. I would say that the most unethical Biblical doctrine of all is that of eternal damnation. [23] It is hard to understand how anyone who interprets the Bible to say that God keeps people alive for purposes of eternal torment, instead of simply annihilating them, could also suggest premise ( 8 ) of the Argument from the Bible. And yet there are such.  <p>DBC67<br>

The bible makes God out to be a terrorist.  I was thinking about the lamb's blood put on all the doors in order to kill the first born sons of the Egyptians.  I don't believe in biblical myths, but if this story is true, then God killed a bunch of innocent children because of how their parents were treating the Israelites.  People do the same thing today.  If they are pissed at the Israeli or US government, just kill the &quot;children&quot; as long as you have a legitimate beef with the &quot;parents&quot;.  The sad part is that I had a little book as a kid that my aunt and uncle bought me.  It was about the story of Moses, and it was one of those that had a tape, and you turn the page of the book when you hear a ding.  I'm sitting here thinking &quot;oh yay, God protected the Israelites&quot;.  Well, what about the friggin Egyptian kids who were innocent.  As an adult I realize that it isn't cool to tell children stories about killing the children of your enemies.  If I would have followed religion, then I would have accepted this incident, and I would in turn be telling that story to my son.  I guess the lesson is to be good, but don't piss anyone off.  Otherwise God will kill your children.  Oh, but don't worry, he still loves you.  <br>
<br>
I don't believe ethics and morals come from our religion.  I believe they come from the natural process of creating civilization.  If everyone just kills, mames and screws whenever they feel like it, then you have anarchy.  Once a respect of others is put into place, then you start to have order.  Our ethics and morals are just complying to the natural laws of order.  Besides, if you can't figure out how to do the right thing without your preacher telling you, then you aren't a genuinely decent person to begin with.  I don't believe the bible teaches much about proper ethics.  I think it teaches fear.  If you follow God's ways, then you justify breaking our commandments.  God tells people &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot;, yet he slaughters by the dozen according to the bible.  Sounds like a hypocritical God to me.  The men who wrote this document probably should have proofread their work to iron out all those consistencies.  When I proclaim myself to be a prophet, then I'll remember to hire an editing team.<br>

<br>
First and for most, no one that doesn't believe, understand, or accept (or however you want to put it) God's souviernty(sp?) would accept or understand what was done in the Bible by God.  I can imagine that from an atheist's standpoint these things would seem horrible and unethical, but then I am not onw to talk, I wasn't there experiencing these things either.<br>
<br>
Not all Christian religons believe the following...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Furthermore, the exclusivist threat of &quot;accept Christ or else be damned for eternity&quot; is unethical.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>

I think that Witnesses are the only religon that believe along this line.<br>

&quot;Ezekiel 4:1-12 Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it the city, even Jerusalem: And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about. Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel. Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity. For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year. Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it. And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege. Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof. And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it. Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink. And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.<br>
<br>
The above story is silly, but it does say something about the character of God. He tells Ezekiel to bake Human Shit Cakes. Yummy! <br>
<br>
Ezekiel 4:13-17 And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them. Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth. Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment: That they may want bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.<br>
<br>
Ezekiel gets to eat shit cakes made with cow patties. Everybody else gets Human Shit Cakes.

<br>
My first thought is that this article is not one on Biblical ethics, but one on God's ethical nature - don't you think?  Anywho...<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>God is described in the Bible as killing people for no good reason<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
&quot;For no good reason&quot;  is an assumption of the writer that he can know a reason for all that God does.  Agreeing with what Trish said above, unless you have some understanding of God's sovereignty, you're not going to understanding some if not most of what He did when He did it.  Unless someone can open their mind up to the fact that God created therefore He can pretty much destroy if He wants to because He is sovereign and has all authority to do such.  If you're not open to that possibility, then don't continue reading as your not open to any answers given to you either.  <br>
<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
still with me?  Okay!  Just a few of your points I will touch on then...<br>
<br>
A basic rule of thumb, if God is going to specifically talk to you and telling you something specifically to do or not to do...wouldn't you listen?  And if you don't listen, then I think you deserve your punishment!  Unethical?  By whose standards?  If they are God's rules, and God has set forth the punishment - I don't see an excuse.<br>
<br>
Just a few specifics:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Seventy men who looked into a box (1Sa 6:19).</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - not a box...but the ark of the covenant.  BIG difference.  God had commanded &quot;Don't Touch!&quot;  to look inside they would have had to touch...specific command, specific punishment. (This also applies to the next point of the man who &quot;touched the box&quot; - #9 on your list)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Three thousand of the Levites' brothers, friends, and neighbors, who had become unruly (Exodus 32:27-28 ).</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  - not just unruly, but had begun to worship an idol they had formed instead of God!  Again, BIG difference.  God commanded their worship to Him only.<br>
<br>
As for the destruction of an entire population (no, I'm not going to address each of them separately)...same point.  God is loving and merciful, but He is also just.  These nations were as much a part of God's creation as Israel was, and God does not allow evil to continue unchecked.  God's command to destroy was designed to protect the Israelites from being ruined by the idolatry and immorality.  In most cases, against the Canaanites, they were up to their ears in intense idolatry, and consistent rebellion against God.  This was not the right kind of living that God had commanded and needed to be removed.  If it continued, it would affect all of Israel (as it later did in the book of Judges)  God's purpose was to keep the people's faith and religion uncontaminated.  One group God commanded destroyed were a group of terrorists...they lived to attack others and carry off their wealth.  This group consistently attacked the Israelites, and the Israelites would never live peacefully in the promised land as long as this group existed.<br>
<br>
1. Consulting a witch (Le 20:6; Dt 18:11). <br>
These were outlawed because God was not the source of their information.<br>
<br>
2. Blasphemy or merely having a different religion (Ex 22:20; Le 24:10-23; Dt 13:1-15, 17:2-5, 18:20; Jos 23:7,16; 2Ki 18:40). <br>
While it may seem severe as punishment, it shows how seriously God expects us to take our relationship with him.  God should be treated with utmost reverence.<br>
<br>
3. Gathering sticks or kindling a fire on the Sabbath (Ex 31:14-15, 35:2-3; Nu 15:32-36). <br>
Again, seems severe, and it was.  This act was a deliberate sin, defying God's law against working on the Sabbath.  (Direct command, direct punishment)<br>
<br>
4. Eating the wrong food (Ex 12:15,19; Le 3:16-17, 7:22,25-27, 17:10-16).<br>
The fat portions spoken of here were regarded as the best portions; therefore it was appropriate to dedicate them only to God rather then eat them.  Blood is symbolic of the river of life, and life was God's gift and His alone...blood had to be returned to God and not used by the people. They were commanded to eat unleavened bread because they did not have the time to wait for it to rise.  <br>
<br>
5. Being a disrespectful or disobedient child (Le 20:9; Dt 21:18-21). <br>
There is no evidence that this punishment was ever carried out, but the point was that disobedience and rebellion were not to be tolerated in the home or allowed to contine unchecked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Bible condones slavery. [21] It also contains many rules that are discriminatory against women.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
This same argument?  The Bible does not condone slavery.  The usual verse brought up with this is 1 Pet 2:18...it is not slavery, it is servanthood.  Something that was quite common during the New Testament.<br>
The Bible also does not support oppression of women.   What is given in the Bible is a clear and concise order for us.  From the beginning the Bible places both man and woman at the pinnacle of God’s creation.  Neither sex is exalted, and neither is depreciated.  This is not grounds for denying the essential equality of male and female.<br>
God declares that both sexes are equal in his sight: “God created them, male and female…in his image” (Gen. 1:27).  This is equality in essence.  Jesus repeated this truth in Matthew 19:4.  Likewise the apostle Paul noted the interdependence of man and woman: “Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man….However, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.  For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman.  But everything comes from God” (1Cor. 11:9-12).<br>
These verses speak for separate roles for each, not to relative importance or value in the spiritual body of Christ where “there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:28 ).<br>
The words in 1 Corinthians 11 are not used to indicate control or supremacy, but rather, “the source of.”  Because man was created first, the woman derives her existence from man, as man does from Christ and Christ from God. (Obviously this one bugs me a bit when people use it as an argument against Christianity)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>God also apparently ordered stealing by having the Israelites plunder the Egyptians (Ex 3:22).</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Nope, not quite right.  The word used in the noted scripture is not to steal, but rather to take away, whether in a good or bad sense, and if one would actually read the verse, you can see that at the beginning of the verse they were ordered not to steal, but to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ask</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Adam and Eve were victims of entrapment and did not deserve their punishment.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
God wanted Adam to obey, God gave Adam the freedom to choose.  Without the choice, Adam would have been like a prisoner, and his obedience would have been hollow. <br>
<br>
Regarding the killing of the First-born during the Passover.  I don't know, but I really think this could, among other things, be a case of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;...remember at the beginning, Pharoah had all the Hebrew baby boys killed because he freaked that they were getting to be too many.  But this is just my take on it.<br>

I don't believe there is one error that extends to the original text that has ever been shown.  This is not to say that there are not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>difficulties</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Mistakes come not in God's revelation, but in man's misinterpretations.  Genuine mistakes have been found <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>in copies</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that were made hundreds of years after the original autographs.  In general there are important things to remember:<br>
1.  These errors are in the copies<br>
2.  They are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>minor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> errors (often in names or number) which do not affect any teaching.<br>
3.  These errors are relatively few in number.<br>
4.  Usually by the context or another verse (as is shown) we can know which one is in error.<br>
5.  Just because there may be a copyist error, the entire message will still come through.<br>
<br>
Now...<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Creation -</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This is a matter of spiritual death vs. physical death.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Does God not have respect to people? Or does he?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
- This is an error of the critic - the correct translations in the first group mean partiality, and not lack of respect. THe second group translates into &quot;high regard, taking notice, and turning toward&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Whether or not God tempts</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Again, error of the critic in not checking the original meaning of the word which is actually &quot;test&quot;...God does test, but he doesn't tempt, nor is He temptable.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>And why would Jesus ask this, if God tempts no one?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The verse reads &quot;Do not let us be lead <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>into</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> temptation&quot;, meaning &quot;help keep us out of trouble&quot;...again God doesn't do the tempting.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Genesis 35:10- And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.<br>
Genesis 46:2- And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
The point is NOT that God forbids everybody from calling him Jacob (in fact he is called Jacob just 4 verses later); rather the idea is that he would no longer be KNOWN as &quot;deceiver&quot; (Jacob) but as &quot;God's wrestler&quot; (Israel).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Whatever you do, don't make graven images</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Again, critic error - the first two speak of worshipping created idols in the place of God, while the critics second set of scripture speak of the construction of the ark of the covenant which God used specifically to meet with the Israelites - not hardly an idol, nor is it desribed as such.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1 Samuel 28:6- And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets<br>
1 Chronicles 10:14- And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
A few points here:  1 Chron. 10:14 is an incomplete thought.  By reading the previous vs. it shows us that his requests to God only came as a final thought.  The apparent contradiction here lies in understanding Sau's motives and the timing of his request to God.  His frantic request came only when he had tried everything his own way.  He never went to God unless there was nowhere else to turn.  When he finally asked, God refused to answer.  Saul sought God only when it suited him, and God rejected him for his constant stubbornness and rebellion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1 Chronicles 10:14- And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse<br>
1 Samuel 31:4- Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Saul did indeed take his own life, but it was God who arranged a defeat in battle sot hat Saul would die &amp; his kingdom taken from his family.  God rejected Saul because of his stubbornness &amp; rebellion, &amp; God judged him for his sins.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2 Samuel 24:1- And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.<br>
1 Chronicles 21:1- And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hebrew writers did not always distinguish between primary and secondary causes.  So for God to allow Satan to tempt David, to them it was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>as if</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> God did it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Baasha died in the 27th year of Asa's reign! But then Baasha came against Judah AND built Ramah 9 years after he died!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Here, the queen-mother, Maachah, takes on an important role when her son Abijam dies after reigning only 3 years.  She adopts one of his sons Asa (I Kings 15:10) apparently as a figure-head and actually reigns herself for the first 10 years (see II Chronicles 14:2).  After this period, Asa wins a great battle, is encouraged by the prophet in chapter 15, and takes over.  He cleans the idols out of Judah AND Benjamin (as noted above) and removes the idolatrous Maachah as queen (I Kings 15:13 and II Chronicles 15:16).  Likely this reign of the Queen mother alongside Asa is the reason for the discrepancy in dating the Baasha event by how long Asa had ruled.<br>
<br>
The next 3 sets of &quot;contradictions all deal with point #2 listed above, so I won't go into them any further.<br>

By this rationale I can go home and kill my kids.  This argument breaks on many points, especially if you believe in eternal damnation and hell.  The TIME at which god chooses to intervene and kill someone will directly impact their ability for salvation.  It doesn’t matter who robs them of their opportunity, every second stolen could have been the second they repented and accepted.  Thou shalt not kill, not even god.

If god created everything, then what meaning does the physical trappings of existence carry for him?  Why should he care that this rock gets touched when he can always create a new one?  If I hear gods voice, I’ll go to therapy.  If god is telling me to kill, I will get locked up (Son of Sam anyone?)<br>
<br>
Frighteningly Candy, all these excuses you make for god could just as well be applied to hitler or stalin.  They are arguments for religious intolerance and killing.  Convert or die.  The man who was stoned to death for gathering sticks was not an isrealite, he was of another faith (apparently whose doctrines did not hold the same line about any sabbath.)  By your arguments you can go kill anyone who doesn’t worship your god, furthermore, who does worship your god but not in the same way you do.  What if a different sect says Wednesday is the sabbath?  Do you kill them?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>By this rationale I can go home and kill my kids.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So what you said wouldn't apply to any of us because we do not have this power. <br>
<br>
Now keep in mind that I personally do not have a belief in hellfire and damnation.  I believe all that have died are asleep in death and that ALL will be resurrected and then be judged, and then any that do not accept the Word of God will be destroyed(to nothingness, cease to exist) along with the devil.<br>

We as humans do punish our children though.  We punish them within human limits.  There are some things that can do as punishment that fit for what we are capable of, but our limits are narrower(is that a word) than God's.  If you set rules before your children and the consequenses and then they broke the rules, do you just let it slide?  Or do you follow through?<br>

I do not beat my kids, I do not belittle them emotionally, I do not kill them.  I speak with them and I withhold priviledges if necessary.  That's all that is needed.  Not torture, emotional oppression or eternal suffering.  I do not beat my son for my daughter's transgression, nor my daughter for my great grandfather's errors.  How can I, a mere human, mortal and flawed, be a better parent than this god you lay claim to?  <br>
<br>
People are dead.  Killed by human hands in your god's name (or claimed to have been killed by your god directly.)  Here and now is all we get.  The concept of a sin is a judeo/xian concoction and has no worth to me, but the idea of robbing anyone of the one chance they get on this earth is wrong.  Period.  If they are gathering sticks, praying to idols, drinking alcohol or lending money.  As Candy unintentionally pointed out, your whole religion is based on justifying the killing of others.  &quot;Gods will&quot;, &quot;Who are we to question god's plan&quot;, &quot;God created therefore he has a right to destroy and you have none to question it.&quot;  He is a war god and his doctrine underscores it.  It has hell, it is rife with killing, and it is agressive in the supression of other theology and cultures.  Smash their idols, take their offerings, enslave their women and then go to bed at night telling yourself you just saved their imortal souls.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You as a mortal cannot fathom god's plan, so as long as you understand that you cannot understand then you'll understand what I explain even though I admit I don't understand (so if I get it wrong and you show it, it is my fault not god's.)&quot;  Nice disclaimer. <p>DBC67<br>

<br>
The same arguments that were applied to abortion I think have merit here.  I do not think a viable fetus should be executed.  Once it can survive on its own it is no longer a parasite on the host mother and is entitled to rights and protections under the law.  We do not execute the mentally handicapped just because they are not mentally as strong.  The very same rule applies to god, no matter how big and tough the bully is.  Once he takes the life, the consciousness, the sentience of another being, he ceases to be just or worthy of worship.  I would overthrow any king or emperor or president that felt he could wantonly kill whole cities just because he was the sovereign.  That is not god that is the devil.  <br>
<br>
I do call myself a skeptic.  I accept what is proven, I discard what is not. Once it is proven, I will stop discarding it.  Saying you’re not going to try and prove your case because I haven’t accepted it already is not a lack of open-mindedness on my part, it is a weakness in the argument itself.  I am sorry if you are going to abandon the effort because the wall did not fall on the first note of your trumpet.  I genuinely did want there to be a better reason for something like this to hold that wonderful mind of yours prisoner.<br>

For the sake of this argument, you either accept Him or you don't.  It's not going to work to say he killed all the firstborn if there wasn't blood on the door unless you think He really did, kwim?

I am accepting the premise that he exists for the sake of this argument.  I am not calling into question his presence.  I am calling into question his ethics.  It was put forth that he behaved unethically and the rebuttal was that he has some kind of right to not have to be ethical.  This was termed his sovereignty and I am not accepting that he has that right.  I am asking it be explained better than “I can’t understand because I don’t believe” or the “He’s the mommy, that’s why” circular proofs.  My impartiality as a skeptic has been impeached and I am defending it.  Skeptics accept what can be reasonably proven.  While his existence is not the subject, I submit that even if we waived the existence debate, he STILL isn’t worthy of mature, reasoned respect.  His actions are vindictive, jealous, petty and arbitrary.  Please, someone demonstrate I am wrong.<br>

This is what prompted my comments here, because I think we are going on assumptions for the sake of argument.  In the context of this argument here she doesn't need to provide evidence of that any more than the evidence that it was God who did all those horrible things in the first place.<br>
<br>
I'm going to be honest, I have just about as many questions about the Old Testament as the skeptics here.  I have not studied it very thoroughly.  Because of my beliefs of what the Bible is and where it came from I think there is  a very good chance that we are getting a pretty twisted version of some of the actual events that happened.  I'm not saying this to critcize the Bible in any way, but I do believe it has been in the hands of men for an awful long time and than it is so difficult between translations, twists, cultural context, figurative or literal, etc, etc, that I'm not sure how literally some of those events need to be taken.<br>
<br>
Let's just say I have a lot of questions myself when I get to the other side <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , circumcision not being the least of which if anyone wants to start a thread on that, I haven't dared to yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Anyway...I do see what your argument is DBC, &quot;even if a being of this description exists, is it worthy of worship?&quot;  Maybe I just misunderstood that particular point when you were asking for proof of His ability to resurrect.<br>

With the belief that there is a God, there is also the belief that you will eventually live forever.  For some(most) religions this is believed to be done in heaven right after death.  For JWs (that's me) it is believed to be done here on earth(not immediately after death).  So with this belief, our life here on earth at this time is relatively short compared to forever.  This is were our faith really comes into the picture.  <br>

I<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> am accepting the premise that he exists for the sake of this argument. I am not calling into question his presence.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Because to accept that he exists, means accepting that there is something after this life(whatever way you want to believe, earthly hope or heavenly) not that this is the only chance that we get on this earth.<br>
If you were to live for 85 years here on this earth as it is right now, how important is it going to be to you in 5,000 years?<br>
<br>
Question for you then DBC, what kind of God would you worship?  What would the qualities have to be for you to accept that God as worthy of your worship?  <br>
<br>
Also, what sort of dicipline(if any) would you have inflicted on the Isrealites?  God has some pretty explicit laws that they broke, should he have just said, &quot;Oh well, those weren't important.&quot; And let things go or what?  Remember, this is all based on the belief that there is a God that created us and all that we know.<br>

There are no errors, or wait...no there are errors, but they are not god's fault and they are minor and don't effect the big message. Do you refer here to the mistranslation of the Greek word for &quot;awake&quot; which xians take to mean resurrected and risen from the dead? That's also a minor error, but just look at the big implications of this, now largely pagan holiday (eggs, bunnies, chocolates, reproduction, resurrection...it's rivals xmas in pagan traditions).<br>
<br>
Well gosh....&quot;difficulties&quot;...what to say here. This is very politically correct, but not accurate and if god is so all-powerful it doesn't seem very wise of him to let flawed men decide which books to put in his bible and mistranslations to abound. Perhaps he does not care about his children getting a good, clear picture of his desires or perhaps he feels he is above that unlike us mortal parents, but this puts him in my negligent parent category and means you feel he is beyond good and evil. If he says what's right and wrong and answers to noone, then he is not &quot;good&quot;, he is beyone good and evil as Nietzsche would say and as DBC has pointed out, this is exactly what led Hitler to his conclusions and actions.<br>
<br>
Trish-I know you asked DBC, but I’ll answer on my own behalf too since it was not god’s existence, rather ethics I call into question (particularly as a parent). What kind of god would I worship?<br>
<br>
A loving one with neither thirst for blood, nor egotistical need to be worshipped by it’s children, nor bitter vengeful attitude that those who refuse this worship should suffer eternally. I guess this is why I’d be looking more for a mother-creator-supporter-guiding, gentle hand. <br>
<br>
ST <p>&quot;I don't have any evidence of that... Just in terms of allocation of time resources, <br>
religion is not very efficient.  There's alot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.&quot; <br>

What would the qualities have to be for you to accept that God as worthy of your worship? <br>
<br>
Also, what sort of dicipline(if any) would you have inflicted on the Isrealites? God has some pretty explicit laws that they broke, should he have just said, &quot;Oh well, those weren't important.&quot; And let things go or what? Remember, this is all based on the belief that there is a God that created us and all that we know.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->What kind of god would I worship?  Well there are a couple terms in there that need some tighter agreement of definition before I can really answer that.  First of all, what is worship?  If by worship you mean service to god, then I would only worship a god who required of me the service of being the best person I can by every measure I have available to me, chief among those love, reason, logic and skepticism.  I could not worship any deity who was jealous, selfish, insecure and hate-filled.  If by worship you mean tithe or sacrifice, then I don’t see that as appropriate ‘worship’ for any type of Supreme Being.  That would be like me taxing my kids’ allowances and in reality, only serves the church as a capitalistic predator, not god himself.  Second is what is a god?  I see the xian god as small and petty.  A god for me would be a supreme power, a creator, a first mover who moved not because he wanted me to scrape and kneel, but because the creation was worth creating.  My idea of god would not require my worship, or even acknowledgement.  So I guess the short answer for you about what kind of god would I worship is, “I wouldn’t.”  <br>
<br>
Next I will address the Israelites and god’s discipline.  What sort of discipline would I expect of god?  I would expect exactly what he did, which is nothing.  The story does a nice little deal on attributing the atrocities to god, but as we have seen from the number of plagues god visited upon us this year and the number of burning bushes telling us where to stand or find milk and honey, god is not active in the real world.  Now if the story were to be believed and he killed wantonly, gave the possessions of others unjustly, and tortured arbitrarily (which is what ‘punishment’ is when it meted out to the innocent) then I would say you follow the devil himself, not god.  It is a total self-delusion to blindly accept those laws that suit you and disregard those that you apathetically decide to ignore.  God has lots of pretty explicit laws.  Take for example, “Thou shalt not kill.”  Straightforward and clear, yet someone has to kill all these rule-breakers god says must die.  Who is to kill the stick gatherer, drunkard or idolater?  The disrespectful child, unwed mother or homosexual?  Why can’t god kill them if he is so damn powerful, he was able to smite those who presumed to touch his magic luggage, didn’t he?  Do you have to keep a pagan on retainer to do all your executions?  His minions are forbidden killing, then required to.  If it is so convenient to say, “Oh, well that shellfish junk and the whole wool/cotton thing aren’t important.” then why not any of the others as well?  Why not the ones where 130,000 people have to die without choice or defense, wouldn’t that be preferable to ignore than the ones like shellfish where it is a personal decision and you fall on your own choice?  So I guess the short answer for you about what kind of punishment I would inflict on Israel is, “I wouldn’t.”<br>
<br>
The kind of god I would worship is one who would not require me to and only asked that I be the best I can.  So I guess I am worshiping him every day already, he doesn’t care, neither do I and we both are happy that way.<br>
<br>
Now, in reply to the misconstruing of my acceptance for the sake of argument that god exists in contrast to my belief that here and now are all we know we get, I will again (surprise) have to disagree.  Even among different xian cults there is a disagreement about heaven, hell, oblivion, who gets raised, who is saved, who gets recycled, where, when and how you are shuffled off this mortal coil and to what result.  I conceded that god existed for this argument, I did not concede that the bible was inerrant, there existed a heaven or hell or any of the other tag-ons you all seem so excited to just toss into the soup.  You all agree there is this god guy, and that the bible is his word.  I am accepting the first and calling into question his ethics based on the second.  Period.  That’s all.  Everything else is your luggage and I never agreed to carry it.  <br>
<br>
We can all agree that here and now is something we get.  We may disagree that it is ALL we get, but we at least agree that we get this much anyway.  (I refuse to engage any Nihilists here.)  We seem to have a quorum on that there are some requirements that must be met to get into heaven, irrespective of what they are, we can concede that there are some.  Consequently, anyone, even god, who takes someone’s life before they met that qualification, has unjustly denied them their chance at heaven.  Now god may be omniscient, in which case you argue that he knew they’d never make the cut, to which I respond that your argument totally invalidates the concept of choice and freewill, and therefore your explanation of god.<br>

Eusebius of Caesarea was born a little after A.D. 260, became bishop of Caesarea about 313 and lived there until his death in 339.  He wrote a history of the church as a contemporary to the codification of the bible.  Yes, someone was actually there.  You may find his <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/eusebius/eusehe.html" target="top">work</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> informative.  Even then the church founders had trouble discerning what was inspired, what was maybe-not-so-inspired, and what was bunk.  Don’t take my word for it read his.  He was there.<br>
