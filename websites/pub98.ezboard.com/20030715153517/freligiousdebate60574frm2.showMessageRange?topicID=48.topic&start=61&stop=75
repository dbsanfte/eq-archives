<br>
So then Abel has been resurrected?  All his kids are current LDS ministers?  The ban has been removed so this must be so.  Did priests have to submit a geneology proving no connection with Cain when they applied or did you rely on genetic testing?<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The descendants of Elijah Abel are all white; because Abel's sons and daughters married white Mormons back in the late 19th century.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

So if you breed out the appearances of the curse, yer all set.  Yet it isn’t what god commanded because he said anyone with even one drop of blood was cursed (how does this comport with blood donations btw?)  You play tricks with gods will….<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the General Authorities of the Chuch, who are called &quot;The Brethren&quot;, prayed for months that the Priesthood-ban be finally lifted.

Hate to disagree, but a mistake is a mistake weather it is admitted or not.  This single passage reveals more of the lie of your religion than anything I could produce.  Until the criminals admit the crime it doesn’t become one… Bullshit.  They are just blaming god for their decisions.  How much more lovely is Satanism where they have to take responsibility for their actions themselves, no wonder I respect my satanist friends more than my mormon ones.<br>

<br>
So there was no racism before the 19th century?  Funny, all those black guys will be glad to know the american colonial slaves weren’t victims of racism.  Funnier still that Darwinian evolution never taught racism either.  Racists try and adapt the theory to their beliefs, but it isn’t contained in the work.  <br>

I'm sorry, but reading all of that just turned my stomache. As for why should African Americans want to join a church that is racist? Well hell, women are christians, and the bible promotes some really serious sexism. Christianity brain washes people into thinking you have to be subjugated and put down. You are sinners, so you deserve to be discrimated against. Its so fucking warped. <br>

Thank you Shirene for providing MORMON sources to back up my argument that your god is a racist, pig bigot and that your church institutionalized racism, then tried to cover it up by saying &quot;it is irrelevant&quot; since 1978 when a bunch of ordinary men prayed to god to change his racist little mind.<br>

Or maybe the fact that the LDS church was teaching and baptizing AA's at the same time OTHERS were still owning them.  Or the part that other brown and black skinned peoples (aboriginees or Australia, Philipinos etc) were not denied the priesthood.<br>
<br>
And just for the record ST the Curse of cain was not the brown skin.  The curse was no priesthood.<br>
<br>
About Abel being resurrected, I have not heard or seen anything that identifies him specifically, but we do believe and this is biblical, that many of the righteous who lived before Christ were also resurrected at the time Christ was resurrected.  We also believe that other righteous individuals who lived after the time of Christ have been resurrected as well (specifically, Moroni a BoM prophet) and so it would not suprise me that Abel has been resurrected and that his descendants have recieved the priesthood through temple ordinances for the dead.<br>
<br>
You can believe anything you want to believe, but the FACT is that the vast majority of LDS are not racists.  ( I cant say all because I know a few who are)<br>
<br>
Oh and about the different quorums in the church, 30 years is not a long time considering that most of the men who serve in the First Presidency and the Quorum of the 12 Apostles  are in their 70's  80's and 90's  and have been in those quorums 20-30 years or more.  The next quorum is the 1st quorum  of the seventy and most of those guys have been there as long as I can remember and Im 36.  The men who serve in the 2nd quorum of the 70 only serve 5 years and rotate more quickly.  And you would see by a photo that it is a diverse group, Asian, Latino, European, African American, Polynesian.  These men usually serve in the area presidencies and direct the church activities in several nations under their stewardship.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the heirarchy - Prophet &gt; First Presidency&gt; Twelve Apostles&gt; Seventy (both quorums)/Area Presidencies&gt; Stake Presidents (responsible for about 10 congregations) &gt;  Bishops (responsible for one congregation)  Again considering that most men (caucasian and all other races) do not even get called as a bishop in their life, and if they do they usually serve 5+ years as a bishop.  Before a man is called to Stake President which he usually does for 10 years,he is often a high cousellor on the stake level for a number of years.  When you take into consideration that an African American man recieved the priesthood 30 years ago, then after 1-2 years was called to serve in the Elders quorum presidencies.  did that for 2-3 years,had another calling for a few years (sunday school teacher, maybe bishops counsellor for 5 years) then Bishop for 5 years, back to the high counsel for 5 years, called as Stake President for 10 years, maybe went on a mission with his wife, (Im just throwing in all the possible scenarios), then maybe ws called as a counsellor to the mission president in the area for 3 years and then out of the 11 million members of the church 70 men are called to be in the quorums of the 70, it is not suprising that only a handful would be called to that quorum, and considering that the men usually serve over the countries that they live in, it is logical that we would have more Caucasian, Latin Asian and Polynesian men  in those quorums as the church has been established in those areas of the world for a much longer time than in Africa.   The church has only been in Russia for 13-14 years, and to my knowlege there may be only 1 or none leaders in those quorums from Russia.  We are currently talking with the Chines Govt to have the church be recognized in that country. My guess is if we were to open a mission there, the mission president and area pres would be from Hong Kong as the church has been there a long time and they speak the same language.  Although the calls are inspired, often it also has to do with logistics and the experience in the church and church leadership that those men have.  I mean they have to be the guiding force and so they have to have a deep understanding of what it means to lead a ward, a mission or a stake and that only happens with time and other leadership opportunities.<br>
<br>
The other thing is we dont think that the general authorities (those in those first 3-4 quorums) are more important to the Lord than the rest of us.  We all have a calling or responsiblity in the church.  Before Nakia was Prim. Pres I was.  Now I teach the 16 year olds.  My dad was a bishop for 5 years and then was called as scout leader.  Its not like the corporate ladder.  Not one bishop I know thought he was the right person for the job, its a lot of work and stress and nobody in their right mind would Hope for that calling.  Because on top of the calling, everyone but the first several quorums also has a 40 hour  a week job on top of caring for their flock.  <br>
<br>
The first four quorums do alot of traveling in their areas and are usually (not always) older retired gentlemen.  In the twelve apostles right now are a world renowned heart surgeon, a superior court judge, a University president all of whom gave up successful &quot;careers&quot; to serve.  Its not as if they had been campaining to get called.<br>
<br>

“Not denied”, patently different from “Given”.  Please provide us with the vast array of enlightened and sanctimonious people of color indoctrinated into your churches upper priesthood.  In 25 years since revoking the ban you roll out one token guy and brag of his making it to the fifth rung down.  Wooo.  Truly a benevolent and enlightened cult.  Each country gets a leader of their demographic, but none of authority beyond their own countries borders.  How condescending, right up there with the papacy.<br>

So then women are cursed too?  After all they get ‘no priesthood’ in their tiny separate-but-equal cult and can rule the children when men aren’t around.<br>

I really think you should examine more closely what we are saying.  We are not accusing individual mormons of being individually racist.  We are saying the church itself is and only that you are its members.  Just like no individual catholic is being called a pedophile, but their donations go to be used as hush money for molested kids by the millions.  This isn’t limited to catholics, as most religious organizations have similar accusations and bribes being tossed around.  They were just an easy example.  So your little troop of boy scouts may be good decent young men, but their dues still fund what is the equivalent of a hitler’s youth program.<br>

<br>
Brigham Young actually said that slavery is a “divine institution.” <br>
While other Mormon leaders and supposed prophets have also commented about the inferiority of blacks and other races in their eyes.   “Let the BLACKS of the south be free, and our community is overrun with paupers, and a reckless mass of human beings, uncultivated, untaught and unaccustomed to provide for themselves the necessaries of life— endangering the chastity of every female who might by chance be found in our streets—our prisons filled with convicts, and the HANG-MAN WEARIED with executing the functions of his office!....... Insensible to feeling must be the heart, and low indeed must be the mind, that would consent for a moment, to see his fair daughter, his sister, or perhaps, his bosom companion, in the embrace of a NEGRO!...(Joseph Smith, as printed in the Messenger and Advocate, Vol. 2, pp. 299-301).<br>
<br>
Mormon apostle Mark E. Petersen said in 1954 at BYU “Let us consider the great mercy of God for a moment. A Chinese, born in China with A DARK SKIN, and with all the handicaps of that race seems to have little opportunity. But think of the mercy of God to Chinese people who are willing to accept the gospel in spite of whatever they might have done in the pre-existence to justify being born over there as chinamen, if they now, in this life, accept the gospel and live it the rest of their lives they can have the Priesthood, go to the temple and receive endowments and sealings, and that means they can have exaltation. Isn't the mercy of God marvelous?<br>

“Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African Race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so.” (Journal of Discourses, Vol. 10, page 110)<br>

John Taylor, the third President of the Mormon Church, spoke about abolitionist Horace Greeley after Greeley visited Utah:<br>
<br>
“... I would not talk to him: I felt myself SUPERIOR to such a mean contemptible cur. I knew he was not after truth, but falsehood. This Greeley is one of their popular characters in the East, and one that supports the stealing of NIGGERS and the underground railroad....he is one of the prominent newspaper editors in the Eastern country, and he is a POOR, MISERABLE CURSE.” (Journal of Discourses, Vol. 5, page 119)<br>

Journal of Discourses  <br>
<br>
A favorite source of material frequently cited by anti-Mormons is the Journal of Discourses. This twenty-six-volume collection of writings of early General Authorities was first published in England between 1853 and 1886 for the intent of providing an income for George D. Watt, the stenographer and publisher for the collection. (Watt, 55.) <br>
<br>
The First Presidency approved the publication and the collected volumes filled the need of getting published conference reports into the hands of members in England. Gerald Jones notes however, <br>
<br>
In considering the reliability of the Journal of Discourses, we should remember certain circumstances. <br>
<br>
Though the First Presidency endorsed the publication of the Journal, there was no endorsement as to the accuracy or reliability of the contents. There were occasions when the accuracy was questionable. The accounts were not always cleared by the speakers because of problems of time and distance. This was especially true during the persecution of the 1880s, which finally forced the cessation of the publication. <br>
<br>
...Doctrinally, members of the Church were growing and learning. Most adults were converts who had to unlearn and relearn many doctrines. They were learning things that our children learn in Primary and Sunday School. Remarks were frequently impromptu. Close, friendly audiences frequently invited formal discussion of varied topics. There was occasional speculation about doctrines that have since been determined unimportant or even misleading. (Jones, 200-01.) <br>
<br>
The Journal of Discourses contains many interesting and insightful teachings by early church leaders and well as intriguing and speculative assumptions and hypothesis of these same leaders. The Journal of Discourses is not, and never has, carried the same weight as scripture (for a definition of scripture-- or “official” scripture-- see my forthcoming article “Journal of Discourses/As Good as Scripture”). It is also important to note that Latter-day Saints do not believe that their leaders (including the Prophet) is infallible. Prophets are entitled to their own opinions, prejudices, and errors, just like everybody else (this topic will be discussed in greater detail in my forthcoming “Doctrinal/Prophets Fallible”). <br>
<br>
Anti-Mormon arguments which rely on quotations from the Journal of Discourses are often straw-man arguments, attempting to claim Mormon doctrine from speculative remarks by early leaders. As Stephen Robinson has expressed, <br>
<br>
...time and time again the Latter-day Saints are denied ...[the] basic privilege of defining and interpreting their own doctrines. Quite frequently a Latter-day Saint attempting to explain the tenets of his or her faith to non-Mormons will be interrupted by some self-styled expert who says, “No, that’s not what you believe; this is what you believe!” There generally follows a recital of some hocus-pocus that is certainly not taught by the LDS Church. Ponder the absurdity of it-- “You don’t know what you believe, but I know what you believe; I know your thoughts better than you do!” <br>
<br>
...When non-Mormons attempt to impose doctrines on the Latter-day Saints or interpret them for us, the resulting fictions generally fall into one of three categories: outright fabrications, distortions of genuine LDS doctrines into unrecognizable forms, or the representation of anomalies within LDS tradition as mainline or official LDS teaching. (Robinson, 1991, 9-10.) <br>

Update since that article I quoted earlier, just an FYI.<br>
In April there were 37 new General Authorities called to the Area Authority quorum of the 70', of those called 13 were Latinos from various Latin countries around the world including a gentleman from Costa Rica who was the district President in one area of my mission 15 years ago, 1 man from the following countries: Taiwan, Samoa, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Indonesia, Tonga, Switzerland and Australia, and two African men (black) from Nigeria.  As I stated before those quorums are responsible for an &quot;area&quot; which is generally several nations.  The ethnic representation is not a quota by any means, but naturally men are often called to serve closest to home, so it is generally a representation of the countries where the men reside.   - Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 359<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/20/03 8:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  re: objectivity of resources</span><hr size=1> Michael R.

We are not saying we know what you believe, we are holding up your churches own words and saying they do not comport with what you are claiming.  We are not permitting you to practice <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>REVISIONISM</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> like the nazis try to about WWII.  A Nazi can claim all day that there was no official party decree against jews or that concentration camps never killed jews.  That does not comport with the facts and neither does what you are saying.  A politician standing before a fundie group claiming to support their agenda and then denying it when a reporter published their words would be treated the same way.  It doesn’t matter if the reference was pointed out by an anti-mormon website, pro-muslim website, financial document or agricultural forecast.  The point is, your church said those things and practiced those policies.  They now attempt to spin-doctor their PR and you are perpetuating their lies and disinformation.  Say I don’t know what I am talking about all day long, comfort yourself at night with the persecution of us worldly types, kvetch day-in and out with DH over the misunderstandings of others, but answer the facts.  Recited before you are no less than 4 document quotations, please address each individually and disprove them or accept the truth of your situation.  You are a practitioner of a racist religion.

I dont even pretend to understand the whole reason that the Hamitic race was not allowed to have the priesthood.  All I can do is rejoice that ALL men can now hold it and all those who previously were denied while on earth can have the work done in the temple and recieve those blessings.<br>
<br>
There is a documentary about the saints in Africa, I dont know the name off hand.  But it follows the prophet on a visit to a numer of African Countries and the love that is expressed by him and the people of Africa is nothing but sincere.  He wept when he told them of the new temple that would be built.  He told stories of whole African congregations that had found the book of mormon and were just waiting for the missionaries to come to baptize them.  One such gentleman was interviewed.  He was a minister who was given a copy while in Europe.  He took it home and began teaching its doctrines to his congregation and the whole congregation was bap[tized when the missionaries came.<br>

One of the African American fathers of a child in my Sunday School class, has been married to a white LDS women for 15 years.  He will be baptized a member of the Church on Saturday.<br>

To a believer like M2, there is no disputing that the sacred texts of Xianity and Mormonism (is that a word or I did I make it up? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) are divinely inspired and the word of their god.  Man, or the men that wrote them, are merely the conduits of god's word, therefore not responsible for the writing nor accountable to it.  To a non-believer like myself and others, there is no disputing that the texts were written by men, and that those men and their followers are accountable for what is in them.  This particular aspect of the debate can never be resolved without a) everyone in the room coming to believe in a higher power or b) everyone in the room denying the existence of a higher power.<br>
<br>
The question I have never seen satisfactorily answered is this: if the Xian god is infallible and all-knowing, then why would he ever need to correct himself or alter his words?  How can the same being who created this amazing universe also be responsible for this little gem: &quot;But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence&quot; (I Tim. 2:12)?  To quote M2, &quot;[T]he LORD can discriminate as He sees fit. He very often has.&quot;  A rather arbitrary god, dontcha think, to discriminate even among his followers?  <br>

We also believe the Bible, but believe that is has been somewhat corrupted in doctrine.<br>
<br>
We also believe that like parents who change the rules as the child grows, God gives us rules to fit our spiritual maturity and can change the &quot;rules&quot; as we grow. (or digress as was the case for the Mosaic law) The basic principles dont change but the application may change.<br>

Except that would mean it was correct in the original and everyone lived according to that one pure form back then and things have gotten worse over the years until now.  That is not supported by the facts, (not that you care about the facts.)  The huge gap you seem at agree with isn’t so much in points of reference, but in reality from your world-view.  You cannot distinguish linear logic, deductive conclusions or inductive reasoning from a circular tautology.  You cannot see racism or misogyny while they stand on your neck and spit in your face.   I agree, there is corruption and perversion of doctrine, but I don’t think it has so much to do with the books as the people. <p>DBC67<br>
