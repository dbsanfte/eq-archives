<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lucas leaned against the wall of the Talon as he watched Lana smile sweetly at Clark.  He shook his head.  <br>
<br>
“What is it with the girls in this town?  You put on some flannel and suddenly you’re attractive?”  Lucas asked.  Lex grinned from his seat at the table next to his brother.<br>
<br>
“You could try it and find out,” he said snidely.  Lucas tilted his head at him and gave him a ‘thanks, but no thanks’ look.  Lex smiled and glanced over at the counter Lucas had just been staring at.  “Ah.  You like Lana,” he observed.  Lucas shrugged as if it were nothing.<br>
<br>
“No,” he said.  “She’s a little too cow-town for my tastes.”  Lex just grinned at his brother and took a sip of his coffee.  “But see?  Look, here comes that cute little blonde girl and she’s going to hang all over him too.”  Lex followed Lucas’s gaze to the front door and saw Chloe walking in.  Lex furrowed his brow and turned back to look at Lucas, who was still watching Chloe.<br>
<br>
“You like Chloe?”  Lex asked in surprise.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t say that,” Lucas said.  “I was just pointing out that all the girls here seem to go for your friend, the farm boy.”<br>
<br>
“Uh huh,” Lex said unconvinced, especially since he noticed that Lucas still had his eyes focused on Chloe.  Lucas looked over at Lex with Lex’s comment and pushed himself off the wall.  He took a seat across from his brother.<br>
<br>
“Okay, so say I like a chick here in town; you think I should wear flannel and that will make her notice me?”  Lucas asked skeptically.<br>
<br>
“I think if you call Miss Sullivan a *chick* that she’s likely to deck you,” Lex answered.  Lucas smiled.<br>
<br>
“Fiery,” he said in an impressed tone.  “I can handle that.”  <br>
<br>
“No you can’t,” Lex said dryly.  Lucas leaned forward.<br>
<br>
“You know the women here so well?”  Lucas asked.  “Tell me the way to her heart.”<br>
<br>
“I would if I thought it was her heart you were interested in,” Lex said with a small smirk.  <br>
<br>
“You’re a laugh a minute,” Lucas said sarcastically.  Lex’s smirk turned into a broad smile.<br>
<br>
“If you like her, why don’t you just ask her out?”  Lex asked.  He already knew the reason, but his brother had been a major pain in the ass since he came back to town, and he was going to have some fun with this.  Lucas glanced back at the counter, where Chloe and Lana were both talking to Clark.  He looked back at Lex.<br>
<br>
“Number one, I didn’t say I liked her.”  He looked back over at Chloe for a second.  “But she could be a nice diversion,” he mused aloud.  Lex arched a disapproving eyebrow.  “And second, you *know* why,” he said.  “Because your *brother* Clark hates me and will kill me if I get anywhere near one of his women.”  Lex chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Not true,” Lex said and took another sip of his coffee.  “He’ll probably just maim you.”  Lucas rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Fine.  You’re not going to help me?  I know how to get her attention.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, really?  You’re going to try and impress her with your vast knowledge of Edge City’s underworld?”  Lex asked sarcastically.  “Or maybe tell her how you’re going to become a corporate giant in a few years.”<br>
<br>
“Depends,” Lucas said.  “Did it work for you?”<br>
<br>
“No.”<br>
<br>
“Well, I guess I won’t be using that then – even though it would probably work for me since I’m better looking,” Lucas said with a smug smile.  Lex laughed and Lucas stood up.<br>
<br>
“So, what are you going to do?”<br>
<br>
“Watch and find out,” Lucas said, turning his back to Lex.  Lex shook his head.<br>
<br>
‘He’s going to get decked – and he’s going to deserve it,’ Lex thought with a smile.<br>
<br>
Lucas strolled over to the counter where Clark was now only talking to Chloe, as Lana was waiting on a table.  Clark eyed him skeptically.<br>
<br>
“Hey Clark,” Lucas said and patted the back of his shoulder.  “You going to introduce me to your friend?”<br>
<br>
“I wasn’t planning to,” Clark replied with a forced smile.  Chloe laughed and stuck her hand out.<br>
<br>
“Chloe Sullivan,” she greeted.  “You’re Lex’s brother, right?”  He nodded and shook her hand.<br>
<br>
“Lucas Luthor,” he said.  Clark arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“You took the last name?”<br>
<br>
“Well,” Lucas said as he shoved his hands into his pockets, “having the Luthor name comes with certain advantages.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll bet,” Chloe said.  Lucas leaned toward her in a leering fashion and Lex frowned as he watched his brother try to pick up on Chloe.  Granted, he didn’t know her that well, but he didn’t like the way he felt when Lucas mentioned that he liked her; and felt even worse when Lucas said something about her being a ‘diversion’. <br>
<br>
‘And yet, you didn’t feel at all threatened when you thought he liked Lana,’ his inner voice said.  Lex frowned again and pushed himself away from the table.  He grabbed his cup and started to walk toward the counter.  He motioned to the waitress behind the counter for a refill with his mug and turned to face Clark, Lucas, and Chloe.<br>
<br>
“I thought you said you weren’t going to help me?”  Lucas asked.  <br>
<br>
“Just getting a refill,” Lex replied.  Lucas nodded and Clark narrowed his eyes at him.<br>
<br>
“Help you with what?”  Clark asked suspiciously.  Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
“Good question Clark.  I’ll make a reporter out of you yet,” she said.  Lex smiled at her response, but Clark and Lucas kept their eyes fixed on each other in what looked like a staring contest.<br>
<br>
“Well, Valentine’s Day is tomorrow,” Lucas started as he looked back over at Chloe.  Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, great,” she mumbled.<br>
<br>
“You don’t like Valentine’s Day?”  Lex asked.  Lucas creased his brow.<br>
<br>
“I thought all chicks liked Valentine’s Day,” he said.  Chloe stared at him in disbelief.<br>
<br>
“Did you just call me a *chick*?”  She asked.  Lex and Clark both smiled.  Lex slapped his brother’s back.<br>
<br>
“And here’s the part where you get hurt,” he said cheerfully.  Lucas rolled his eyes and didn’t see Chloe grab Lex’s new mug of coffee off of the counter.  She threw the contents of the cup toward Lucas and he yelped as the hot liquid splashed on him.  Chloe got her bag and walked out of the Talon, waving politely to Lana as she left.  Lex and Clark both started laughing heartily while Lucas looked down at his wet shirt and jacket.<br>
<br>
“Damn it!”<br>
<br>
“You completely deserved it,” Lex said.  Lucas nodded.<br>
<br>
“You’re right,” he said.  Both Lex and Clark seemed stunned to hear him admit it.  Lucas looked over toward Lana.  “I should have gone for the brunette.”<br>
<br>

<br>
“You deserved it,” Lex reminded him.  <br>
<br>
“You said she was going to slap me, not throw hot coffee at me,” he protested.  Lex lightly chuckled and then poured himself a drink.<br>
<br>
“Actually, I believe I said she’d deck you, not slap you,” Lex corrected.  He took a sip from the glass and then smirked at his brother.  “And you’re lucky that she improvised.  She has a mean right hook.”  Lucas lifted an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Know this from personal experience, do you?”<br>
<br>
“Thankfully, no,” Lex said.  “I’ve never enraged her to the point where she’s had to resort to physical violence.”<br>
<br>
“Don’t see her very often, huh?”  Lucas quipped with a small smirk.  Lex gave him a tight grin and then took a larger swallow of his drink.  Lucas chuckled at his reaction.  Suddenly, the picture had become crystal clear.  “So, why *did* you come over to the counter earlier?”<br>
<br>
“I needed a refill,” Lex reminded him.<br>
<br>
“Uh huh,” Lucas said in a voice that indicated that he didn’t believe him.  “You were jealous.”  Lex arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Of?”<br>
<br>
“Of the fact that Chloe was paying attention to me,” Lucas pointed out.  Lex stared at him blankly.<br>
<br>
“She threw coffee at you.”<br>
<br>
“Only after you came over.”<br>
<br>
“What are you implying Lucas?”  Lex asked with a slight sigh.  Lucas’s mouth curled up in delight as he teased his brother.<br>
<br>
“You like her,” Lucas stated.<br>
<br>
“Of course I like her; she’s one of Clark’s best friends.”<br>
<br>
“No-oo,” Lucas said in a lilting voice.  “You *like* her.”  Lex rolled his eyes and took the last sip from his glass.<br>
<br>
“I don’t have time for this,” Lex said.  He started to leave and had just reached the door when his brother spoke again.<br>
<br>
“So, you said you knew the way to her heart?”  Lucas asked.  Lex turned around with his brow furrowed in confusion.<br>
<br>
“When did I say that?”<br>
<br>
“Back at the Talon,” Lucas clarified.  “You said that you would tell me the way to her heart if you thought that’s what I was looking for, and that implies that you know the way to her heart.”  Lex tried to hide the frown that played at the corners of his mouth.<br>
<br>
“So it does,” he agreed.  Lucas looked at him expectantly.<br>
<br>
“And?”<br>
<br>
“And what makes you think I’m going to tell you?”  Lex asked.  <br>
<br>
“You don’t know,” he observed.  “You don’t know anything more about getting into her good graces than I do, and that’s why you got jealous; because you realized that I might actually have a chance with her.”  Lex scoffed.<br>
<br>
“You wouldn’t have a chance with her if ---”<br>
<br>
“Tsk, tsk,” Lucas interrupted.  “No need to get upset.  And I would have had a chance with her if she liked Valentine’s Day like every other woman on the planet.”  He said the last part with a grumble and Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
“You *might* have had a chance if you had called her a woman instead of a chick,” he said.  Lucas sloughed off the comment.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, yeah.”  A devious look passed over his face and Lex’s grin fell.  “I wonder if it’s too late to make it up to her?”<br>
<br>
“Are you forgetting about the scalding burn all over your chest?”<br>
<br>
“That was before I knew that she’s one of those feminist chicks,” Lucas said.  Lex shook his head in disbelief.<br>
<br>
“Indeed,” he said dryly.  Lucas smiled.  “What?”<br>
<br>
“Nothing.  You just sounded like Teal’c just then.”<br>
<br>
“Teal’c?”<br>
<br>
“On SG-1,” Lucas partially explained.  “Kind of look like him too with the lack of hair and everything.”  He chuckled and rubbed the top of Lex’s head.  Lex swatted away his hand and Lucas started laughing harder.<br>
<br>
“Never mind, I don’t want to know.”<br>
<br>
“Okay,” Lucas said.  He crossed his arms and tilted his head at Lex.  Lex frowned.  Lucas appeared pensive and he didn’t like the look of it.  “So, do you like her?”<br>
<br>
“Lucas ---” Lex stopped when Lucas held up his hand.<br>
<br>
“Before you go into your big denial speech, know this: if you say you don’t like her, then I’m going to go after her.”<br>
<br>
“And if I say I do like her?”  Lex asked.  Lucas smirked.<br>
<br>
“Then you have until midnight tomorrow to prove it,” he answered.  Lex looked at him questioningly and Lucas’s smirk only grew bigger.  “You said you knew the way to her heart – prove it.  Convince her to be ‘your valentine’.”  He said that last part in a sing-song voice and Lex frowned.<br>
<br>
“And if I don’t?”<br>
<br>
“Then, like I said, she’s fair game.”  Lucas laughed at the worried look that marred Lex’s face and then he started to move by his brother and into the hallway.  He turned around for a second and flashed a large teasing smile at Lex.  “Oh!  And I don’t think your buddy Clark is going to help you on this one.  So, let’s leave him out of it, shall we?”  He walked down the hall, leaving Lex standing there, rubbing his eyes with his hand.  Lex let out a small groan.<br>
<br>
“Why couldn’t I have had a sister?”  He asked himself.  His frown slowly spread into a wry grin.  “I do, however, have the next best thing.”  He slid the cell phone out of his jacket pocket and dialed a number he knew by memory.  <br>
<br>
“Sullivan,” Gabe answered.<br>
<br>
“Gabe, it’s Lex,” he greeted.<br>
<br>
“Lex,” Gabe acknowledged.  “Is something wrong?”<br>
<br>
“You could say that.  There’s a situation with your daughter that I need some assistance with.”<br>
<br>
“Chloe?”  Gabe groaned.  “What did she do?”  Lex smiled and chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Threw coffee at my brother,” Lex said.<br>
<br>
“Oh, God.  I’m so sorry, I’ll ---”<br>
<br>
“She was completely justified Gabe,” Lex interrupted.  “Actually, I was hoping to send her something as a means of apologizing for his behavior toward her, and I was hoping that you might have some ideas.”<br>
<br>
“Um, what?  Like her favorite flowers or something?”  Gabe asked.<br>
<br>
“Something like that, but I was hoping for something a little more personal,” Lex admitted.  He could almost sense Gabe arching a suspicious eyebrow.  “You know, so it looks like I actually put some thought into it.”<br>
<br>
“How badly did your brother treat her exactly?”<br>
<br>
“It’s a long story,” Lex covered.  He heard Gabe sigh and grinned to himself.<br>
<br>
“Well, you know she loves coffee.”  He paused for a second before continuing.  “She likes chocolate, although that’s probably too personal.”  <br>
<br>
“Any particular kind of chocolate?”  Lex asked.<br>
<br>
“Uh, yeah,” Gabe answered hesitantly.  “She likes those little chocolate covered coffee beans and the mocha truffles they sell at the candy store downtown.”  <br>
<br>
“Great,” Lex said as he jotted down the information.  “Thanks Gabe.  I appreciate it.”<br>
<br>
“Lex, you know this really isn’t necessary,” Gabe said.  “I’m sure she’s gotten over it already.”<br>
<br>
“Maybe, but I’d rather not have her angry with me just because of some stupid comments that Lucas made.”<br>
<br>
“She threw coffee at him for making comments?”  Gabe asked.<br>
<br>
“Like I said, it’s a long story.”<br>
<br>
“Okay, I’ll talk to you later then,” Gabe said.<br>
<br>
“Right.  Oh!  Before you hang up, what *are* her favorite flowers?”<br>

<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Chloe typed away at her keyboard in the Torch office.  It was early, and except for the janitors and a few straggling teachers, she was alone in the school.  She had the radio turned on and Lex leaned against the doorframe as he watched her sing along with the song that was playing.<br>
<br>
You say you want some fun<br>
You’re not the only one<br>
Not the only one<br>
<br>
You say you wanna run<br>
You’re not the only one<br>
Not the only one<br>
<br>
You will never get over me<br>
I’ll never get under you<br>
Whenever our voices speak<br>
It’s never our minds that meet<br>
<br>
You say you want some<br>
You’re not the only one<br>
Not the only one<br>
<br>
You say you’ve come undone<br>
You’re not the only one<br>
Not the only one<br>
<br>
You will never get over me<br>
I’ll never get under you<br>
Whenever our voices speak<br>
It’s never our minds that meet<br>
<br>
A genuine smile spread across Lex’s mouth as he listened to the words pour from her mouth.<br>
<br>
“That’s quite a suggestive song,” he said.  Chloe practically jumped out of her seat as she swung her head around to look in the direction the voice had come from.<br>
<br>
“God!  You scared me!  Don’t do that!”  She yelled and clasped a hand over her heart.  His mouth quirked upward with amusement and he pushed himself off the doorframe.<br>
<br>
“Sorry,” he said in a completely unapologetic tone.  Chloe nodded and turned her attention back to the computer.  “You’re here early.”  <br>
<br>
“Yeah, so are y---” she trailed off and looked at him quizzically.  “Wait a second.  What are you doing here?”  He took a few steps toward her.<br>
<br>
“I wanted to apologize for my brother and the incident yesterday.”<br>
<br>
“Not necessary,” she said.  Lex tilted his head at her as she started typing again.  He walked closer to her and she finally looked up at him again when he half-sat on the edge of her desk.  “Was there something else?”<br>
<br>
“Why do you hate Valentine’s Day?”<br>
<br>
“What?”<br>
<br>
“Why do you hate Valentine’s Day?”  He repeated.  <br>
<br>
“I – I don’t *hate* it,” she answered.  “I just don’t like it.”<br>
<br>
“Any particular reason?”<br>
<br>
“You want a list?”  Chloe asked in surprise.<br>
<br>
“Lucas made an observation the other day ---”<br>
<br>
“Ah,” Chloe said understandingly.  “So, that’s what this is about.  You can tell your brother that I’m not going to try and set him up with Lana.”  Lex’s brow furrowed in confusion.<br>
<br>
“Why would you set him up with Lana?”<br>
<br>
“He likes her, right?  And she and I are friends, so ---”  Chloe was cut off by the sound of Lex’s laughter.  “What?”<br>
<br>
“You thought that’s why he brought it up?”  Lex asked.  Chloe gave him a ‘well, duh’ look and he smiled at her.  “Is that why you don’t like Valentine’s Day?”  Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“No,” she said and turned to face her computer again.  “If you must know, it’s the chocolate,” she said without facing him.  Lex cringed slightly and was thankful that she didn’t see it.<br>
<br>
“You don’t like chocolate?”  He asked with surprise.  ‘So much for that offering,’ he thought.<br>
<br>
“I love chocolate,” she clarified.  “But the whole point of Valentine’s Day is to have someone else buy it *for* you.  And the only thing Clark and Pete ever get me are those chocolate covered cherries, and they end up eating them all anyway.”  Lex leaned closer to her, but she didn’t immediately notice.  “And besides ---,” she turned to face him again and found herself significantly closer to him than before.  <br>
<br>
“Besides?”  He asked in a husky voice.  Chloe blinked rapidly and pushed her chair away from the desk to distance herself from him so she wouldn’t start to stammer.<br>
<br>
“I – it’s not important.  Why did you say you were here again?”  She asked.  Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
“I have something for you,” he said.  <br>
<br>
“O-kay,” Chloe said skeptically.  She arched an eyebrow as Lex stood up and walked to the door.  He reached down to pick something up that was lying in the hallway and Chloe quickly looked away.  ‘Not thinking bad thoughts about Lex Luthor,’ she repeated as a mantra in her head.  He walked back over and placed a vase full of tuberoses and pink tulips on the desk.  Chloe’s eyes grew wide and she reached out to touch one of the flowers.  She shot a questioning look at Lex.<br>
<br>
“Your dad said they were your favorites,” he explained.  Chloe nodded absently.<br>
<br>
“Interesting how you combined them with tuberoses,” she mused aloud.  Lex couldn’t help the smirk that formed on his lips.  He knew out of everyone he knew that Chloe would know the traditional meanings for the different flowers.<br>
<br>
“Well, you can hardly be the perfect lover without a little dangerous pleasure,” Lex murmured huskily as he stepped closer to her.  Chloe blushed and ducked her head to try and hide it.  <br>
<br>
“Why are you giving me flowers?”  She asked in almost a whisper.  <br>
<br>
“It’s Valentine’s Day,” Lex pointed out.  Chloe looked at him suspiciously.<br>
<br>
“Ye-ah,” she strung out.  “And Valentine’s Day is generally meant for exchanging gifts with the one you love, or at least people that you ---”  Lex placed a large box of candy in front of her and Chloe stopped talking as she looked down at it.  She opened the lid and her eyes grew wide with pleasure.  “You got me mocha truffles?!”  He gingerly placed a bag of chocolate covered coffee beans on top of the other candy and Chloe’s mouth dropped open in sheer shock.  She leapt out of her chair and threw her arms around him, effectively taking him by surprise.  “Thank you, thank you, thank you!”  Lex smiled and Chloe pulled back before he had a chance to return the embrace.  “Why did you do this?”<br>
<br>
“You looked like you could use some cheering up,” Lex lied.  Chloe smiled brightly at him and then glanced down at the flowers and chocolate.<br>
<br>
“Well, I’ve got to tell you Lex, you sure know the way to a woman’s heart,” she said and reached her hand down to pick up one of the mocha truffles.  She took a bite of it and Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
“Fantastic.  Will you tell Lucas so he’ll stop trying to hit on you?”  He asked.  Chloe creased her brow in confusion.<br>
<br>
“What?”  She asked with her mouth still partially full.  Lex smiled wider.<br>
<br>
“Nothing,” he said.  Lex leaned down and kissed her cheek sweetly.  “Happy Valentine’s Day, Chloe.”  She stared at him in astonishment and he smirked at her before turning to leave.  <br>
<br>
“Lex?”  She called out before he got to the door.  Lex turned around and she walked up to him almost nervously.  She rose onto her tiptoes, cupped his face with her hands, and brought his mouth down to meet hers.  It started out gently, but quickly deepened as Lex rested his hands on her hips and Chloe’s hands went from his face to the back of his neck and skull.  Their tongues darted out to meet each others and they engaged in an erotic dance.  When Chloe finally pulled away so she could breathe, Lex rested his forehead against hers and looked at her quizzically.  She smiled at him.  “Happy Valentine’s Day, Lex.”  <br>
<br>

<br>
The End<br>
<br>
So, did you like it? *wink*<br>
