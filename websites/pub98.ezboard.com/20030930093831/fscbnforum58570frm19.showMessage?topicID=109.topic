Date: June 8, 2003<br>
Location: The Hyatt, San Diego</b><br>
<br>
Crowley was out looking for his special Ventrue food, and Vicious was alone in the hotel room. He could hardly believe that Crowley had, seemingly at random, decided that a five-star hotel was absolutely necessary. Well, not absolutely, but he had outright refused to stay in a Motel 6 for three weeks. Vicious walked into Crowley's room and placed an envelope filled with four-thousand dollars in it on his bed. Spoils of war, Vicious figured. Money taken off of Stein, out of Juana's purse, and gained by pawning Stein and Juana's belongings off at various shops. Vicious hoped that would cover his half of the bill at this place. <br>
<br>
Vicious was surprised by Crowley's reactions to some of his actions during this little mission. He was an excellent advisor during the torture of Joseph Stein. He wasn't sure what Crowley had done with Juana, but he'd allowed Vicious to rifle through her stuff. He didn't argue when Vicious proposed destroying the evidence, and he didn’t say anything when he learned that Vicious' definition of "Destroying the evidence" meant "Blow down the entire building with C4". Crowley even made it look like Anarchs had done it.<br>
<br>
But none of that bullshit the Ventrue in Portland constantly rained down on him ever seemed to come up. Crowley might not approve of his methods, but not even once had he berated him for acting on those methods. <br>
<br>
Against his own better judgement, Vicious was starting to actually <i>respect</i> the guy. Shocking.<br>
<br>
But Vicious had work to do, and that work needed to be done. The info Stein had granted was enough to track down his next target, so he was just going to flat out destroy the Sabbat that Kendra had directed him to. There wasn't a single Tradition to stop him either. The Sabbat thought they were all badass, sending their packs into the Camarilla in attempts to take out vampires who didn't want to join them. Fuck that. Vicious could do the job twice as well on his own.<br>
<br>
Vicious called information and requested the phone number for the Five Star, and then called the theater for their address. It was about an hour away on foot, according to the guy on the other line. Whatever. Vicious needed the exercise, and Crowley had the car. <br>
<br>
Heh… Ventrue Stephen Crowley driving around in a dented ’74 Dart with nothing but an AM radio.<br>
<br>
<b>Time: 0023 Pacific Daylight<br>
Date: June 9, 2003<br>
Location: Outside Apartment 32, (Insert street name here), San Diego</b><br>
<br>
Vicious wiped the blood of the last ghoul off of his staff and retracted it, annoyed at the lack of a challenge. As expected, he’d walked right into a Sabbat trap. They had some <I>really</I> nice sculpture there that they made him stare at while he waited for whoever the hell he was supposed to be waiting for. They were in for a big surprise when they tried to stake him, though, as he caught the staking ghoul’s wrist and redirected his momentum into a ghoul who had been on Vicious’ opposite side. From there it had been a flurry of knives and steel on flesh and bone as Vicious made short work of the ghouls. It hadn’t even been worth the effort, really. <br>
<br>
Vicious still didn’t understand what had changed. A week earlier, he had avoided art like the plague, knowing what his cursed Toreador blood would do to him if he saw it. But now, something was different. He felt different too. As though something that had been there all along was gone now…<br>
<br>
Whatever.<br>
<br>
The apartment was small; one bedroom, one bathroom, kitchen, front room. No sign of the regnants. It was a good plan, though. They’d somehow determined that he was Toreador, but he didn’t know how. It certainly wasn’t the way he dressed or acted. Maybe they didn’t determine anything. They just wanted to keep his attention elsewhere while they prepared.<br>
<br>
Again…. Whatever.<br>
<br>
Vicious was finding himself caring less and less about the why and the how, and more about when he’d get to take out the rest of this pack. Hopefully more Toreador. <br>
<br>
This caught him by surprise. Vicous was known in Santa Carla and Portland for his hatred of the Toreador and his violent tendancies, but this felt wrong even for him. It was like his inhibition was gone. Obliterated. Out of the picture.<br>
<br>
One last whatever and a cellphone rang. Vicious turned and rummaged through the bodies until he found the source of the ringing. He hit the talk button and cheerfully answered.<br>
<br>
“Dead ghoul’s phone! Executioner speaking!” Vicious quipped. Even though he certainly didn’t <I>feel</I> deliriously happy right now, simply thinking about the fact that he’d taken out those ghouls filled him with a sense of… Joy. <br>
<br>
Perhaps these Sabbat would take comfort in that fact as Vicious strained their flesh through a wood chipper.<br>
<br>
Fools.<br>
<br>
“So you survived. Maybe you’re worth the time after all. Be in the parking garage in an hour.” A deep, gravelly voice said before cutting off the line. Vicious smiled as he began looting the ghouls’ bodies, retrieving some cash before heading out the door.<br>
<br>
I can hardly wait to bash your skulls in…. did I just think that?!<br>
<br>
<b>Time: 0130 Pacific Daylight</b><br>
<br>
Vicious had just enough time to head to a bar, grab a bite to eat, and then head back. When he strolled into the parking garage, he saw them. Six vampires, two looking like absolute bums, three wearing respectable suits, and the last dressed in a leather jacket and jeans. Vicious strolled up and flicked a switch on the tactical baton he held in his right hand. Earlier that evening he’d jammed a heating coil up into the thing and rigged several batteries into it. It would be good for one use, and one use only. The baton retractors had been ruined, and the body would melt when it reached its maximum charge. Vicious had had time to carefully insulate and wrap the handle before heading out. The vampires saw him coming in armed and arranged themselves into a circle around Vicious when he reached the center of the lot.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I guess you guys know why I’m here. I think killing a pack leader is a serious crime around here, too, so let’s get to it.”<br>
<br>
Amazingly enough, they all seemed shocked at this.<br>
<br>
“You <I>what</I>?”<br>
“What? He’s here to fight us?”<br>
“I thought Kendra said he wanted to defect!”<br>
“So he’s <I>not</I> defecting?”<br>
<br>
Vicious rolled his eyes. These people weren’t too bright. That just made it more fun for him. <br>
<br>
“Well, then let’s just kill him. I’ve got a date.”<br>
“No you don’t. You just feed off that same bitch every night.”<br>
“Fuck you! It’s a different chick, asshole!”<br>
<br>
Vicious whistled. All eyes were on him.<br>
<br>
“Can we play now?”<br>
<br>
The assembled Sabbat looked at eachother for a moment before slowly moving in on Vicious, who smiled with glee, but then stared off into the distance, seemingly horrified. With a shriek of terror, he pointed behind the vampire in front of him and shouted at the top of his lungs….<br>
<br>
“Dear lord! The newspaper has a chain too! Flee!”<br>
<br>
The Sabbat stopped and with a collective “What the fuck” turned in the direction Vicious was pointing. That was all he needed. Two seconds later Vicious had charged ahead, smashed the heat baton across the back of the vampire who was in front of him’s head, and then spun around, smashing it again into his face before he even had time to react to the first strike. The unholy howl of pain proved to Vicious that his plan had worked. The heat rod would be his weapon this match. The scorched vampire clutched at his face as the others realized they’d been had and charged, snarling and yelling. Vicious ripped a knife free from its wrist sheath, stabbed the injured vampire in the neck with it, snapping the blade off in his neck before hitting him in the neck again with the baton. A sick gurgle bubbled up from its throat and the vampire collapsed, writhing in agony and spitting blood. Vicious wheeled around just in time to pull back so that his first experience with Protean wouldn’t result in the loss of his face.<br>
<br>
Intense, searing pain ripped through Vicious’ head, causing him to scream in agony and lash out, smashing the now glowing baton into the face of the woman who had hit him. She too fell back, screaming. Vicious blocked the pain, but to no true purpose as a second vampire hit him hard. Hard enough to send him flying back against a support beam and crack the surface. He dropped onto his feet and hunched over in pain. This was it. He would go down fighting, protecting a cause he believed in. If his death led to action against the Sabbat, rather than mere waiting for them to attack, then so be it.<br>
<br>
But he’d be damned again if these insects didn’t bear the scars of their victory for all time.<br>
<br>
The vampire who’d punched him was already on him again, lifting him by his shirt into the air with a look of pure hatred on his face. That look became pain as Vicious slipped a second knife into his gut and twisted. The vampire yelped and dropped Vicious, who dropped back and kicked the knife handle hard, sending the vampire stumbling back into his approaching companions. Vicious noticed the vampire he’d stabbed slowly getting to his feet several meters away. He let out a scream of rage and charged again. The vampire prepared himself, getting ready to dodge the staff and attack, but Vicious saw it coming. He burst into Celerity just as he came into range, striking twice, seering the flesh once again. More screams, and the vampire fell to his knees in agony. Vicious was struck from behind, once again with incredible force. He flew forward but rolled out of it, slowly standing as he turned around to face his opponents. And they looked pissed.<br>
<br>
He could run now. He could escape, grab Crowley, and get out of town. <br>
<br>
No. No, he couldn’t. Doing that wouldn’t just be a loss in his battle against the Sabbat. It would be an internal scar. It would haunt his memory forever. He couldn’t live with himself if he ran now. Not only that, but if they followed him they’d get Crowley too. Neither of them would be left to take the fight back to the Sabbat. The whole mission would’ve been for nothing but the pointless deaths of some Brujah wannabe and his Ventrue accomplice. <br>
<br>
They were getting closer. They knew he was fighting a losing battle. Why the hell had he done this? What was his problem?<br>
<br>
He was Vicious. That’s what the problem was. He’d <I>earned</I> that name. He’d broken free of his smothering sire, free from the Elysium parties. Free from the idiots too absorbed in themselves to even know that the world was going on around them. Free from those idiots in Portland who thought he was a little spy to be used for their own purposes, threatening him with destruction if he ever revealed them to anyone. <br>
<br>
He’d been close to the top for too long. He’d forgotten his limits. He’d found acceptance in Santa Carla. No longer was he merely a pawn in the elders’ games. He was now a player. He’d earned the respect of those above him and those on his same level. The unfortunate result was his feeling of invincibility. Invincibility that had been disproven by those same vampires who now were within a mere 3 meters from him, preparing to end his existance forever.<br>
<br>
Was Vicious afraid of death? No. He’d already died. Nonexistance? Yes. That, of all things, Vicious feared most of all., and if he were destroyed today, he’d lose eternity. <I>Eternity!</I><br>
<br>
Suddenly, Vicious realized that while his opponents deaths meant nothing….<br>
<br>
His meant everything.<br>
<br>
Vicious reached to his side and pulled his staff from its place at his side. He cracked his neck and then screamed, both extending his baton and throwing the heat baton at the vampire who’d been knocking him around. The vampire ducked in time, but it instead hit the woman behind him, the one with the claws. As he stood, Vicious was upon him, striking with a force that could only be powered by both rage and desperation. The vampire was knocked to his feet, and Vicious stabbed his staff into his chest, pulling it free and diving over him as two of the other vampires made a grab for him. His wrist knives gone, Vicious pulled another from his back sheath, stabbing into the eye of the woman and tearing sideways. A sick, ripping sound and the woman screamed as she fell backwards. Vicious kicked her in the head and lunged over her as well, landing next to the vampire who’d been the target of Vicious’ initial attacks. Although he was motionless, he was still conscious. Vicious smashed down with his staff, crushing his neck and sending him into torpor. Vicious turned to the others, breathing heavily, growling with each breath. Five remained now. One was burnt, and was slowly healing her face. Another was also injured, but healing. Blood soaked his shirt. The other three were fine, thus far unaffected by the attack. But now something was different. They were more cautious in their movements. Vicious couldn’t help it. He burst into maniacal laughter. This enraged the bruiser, who launched himself at Vicious, leaping up to the ceiling with the obvious intention of landing on or near Vicious. Vicious stared to smile… but realized he already was smiling. He braced his staff against the ground and impaled the vampire as he fell. He choked as he slammed into Vicious and was greeted by another knife. This one in his neck. Vicious had snapped it through the neckbone somehow, probably momentum, and with the most powerful force he could summon forth, he ripped to the left, sped up, and slashed again to the right, effectively decapitating the bruiser.<br>
<br>
Dust collected around Vicious’ feet. He was still smiling. Why was he still smiling? Why couldn’t he stop smiling? The woman with the claws screamed and charged, ripping into Vicious’ arm as he stupidly tried to block the attack. More intense pain. Vicious screamed yet again, slamming his baton into her chest, knocking her down. Vicious struck multiple times, using his powers of speed to their maximum effect, beating the woman down into a barely-recognizable pulp. Vicious spun around and staggered off to the side. The damage he’d taken was catching up to him, and he was <I>hungry</I>.<br>
<br>
The remaining three vampires had been moving to attack, but halted when Vicious spun. Vicious saw this and stood straight up, blocking out the pain that shot through his arm as he did so. He knew he couldn’t take them all on at this point, but they sure didn’t.<br>
<br>
The heat rod.<br>
<br>
It was several feet behind the remaining vampires. It was still on. Well, maybe not on, but it was still a superheated chunk of metal. Vicious healed what injuries he could. It didn’t help the pain in his face or the almost overwhelming pain in his arm, but it was enough for him to fight again, if only for another minute. Vicious charged at the three vampires and they charged as well, not expecting Vicious to dive to the side, roll, and run right past them. He reached the heat rod, but was slammed to his knees by a sudden attack. Ignoring the pain, he grabbed the handle of the heat rod and swung around, catching his opponent in the hand. He too screeched in pain and flinched backwards as Vicious stood and staggered backwards as another attack hit him, this time from the left side, and as he looked to the right, the figure there blurred and Vicious was struck two more times. He fell to the ground as blood spilled out of his nose and his mouth, splattering on the ground…<br>
<br>
<I>This is it. <br>
<br>
This is where the story ends.<br>
<br>
So long, Vicious.<br>
</I><br>
<br>
The three remaining vampires surrounded him, looking at the defeated Vicious. Leering at him. Bragging about their defeat of this powerful Camarilla vampire. <br>
<br>
<I>Powerful? Whatever. I bet Orlock could’ve taken you guys. He’s a damn Prince. He’s powerful.</I><br>
<br>
“Let’s take him back to the place. We can get some information out of him.”<br>
<br>
<I>Wanna bet?</I><br>
<br>
“Good idea. Go get a ghoul to lug his bloody ass out of here.”<br>
<br>
<I>What’s the matter? Don’t wanna get dirty? Pussy.</I><br>
<br>
More taunts. More leering. More laughter at Vicious’ expense, but he didn’t care. He’d done his best. His best just hadn’t been enough. Now, at least, he'd die. Crowley would escape. Crowley would...<br>
<br>
Another man approached and tossed Vicious over his shoulder, carrying him out of the parking garage as the other Sabbat rounded up their friends.<br>
<br>
<I>Damnit. You're supposed to kill me!</I><br>
