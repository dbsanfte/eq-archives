To be honest, I would completely agree with the dismissal insofar as there is an obvious bias and interest of theologians in soldifying support for JC so anything pulled from their work is necessarily suspect.  However, the other ancient manuscripts are subject to a lower presumed bias for the mere fact they DON'T have a vested interest in the propagation of JC's existence.  One could hardly argue that the earliest transcribers and authorities were not prejudiced to operate from the assumption of his works.  Their very lives depended upon it.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Moreover, Mithraism was basically a military cult. Therefore, one must be skeptical about suggestions that it appealed to nonmilitary people like the early Christians.&quot; (Ronald Nash – Christianity and the Hellenistic World)<br>
Mithraism flowerd after Christianity, not before, so Christianity could not have copied from Mithraism.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
A number of things, first xianity is a military cult, their's is a war god, the lord of hosts.  His OT works are largely militaristic and cover numerous battles, wars, and deaths for even looking in his arc.  The NT was not presnt yet to spin him off as a loving entity yet so the presumption that he was any different is in error to their time period and perceptions.  Second, military members were men, society was paternalistic and men have families, once more an error of judgement to presume that the non-military hangers-on would not be compelled to pay homage to the dominant male's god.  Lastly, I think if you look into it you will find that Mithraism is in fact older than JC.  When you have 10 items of parallel and one (resurrection - which I will later dispute) doesn't line up, it does not invalidate the strong similarity the rest presents.  Origin does not mean identicle.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Also, in Galatians, one can read that Paul’s message of the gospel was both checked and approved by the original apostles, demonstrating official recognition that his message was not opposed to that of Jesus.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I need hardly point out the err in logic using the bible as proof of it's own correctness. <br>

<br>
First, I'd like to tell you a little about where I'm coming from on this.  I have been a Christian my whole life, raised Catholic (though my parents were pretty non-religious) and joining a Lutheran ELCA church several years ago.  There have always been things about Christianity that have bothered me, and I have done much reading and studying on the subject.  Basically, I still have a lot of problems with the Bible and would *love* if someone could logically explain the contradictions and ethical problems I have with it.  I don't approach my studies as a way to dismiss the Bible, but rather to confirm it as some source of truth in my life--and so far that has not happened.  Everything I learn causes more doubt and confusion, and I often wonder why I stick with this religion.  But I do, and I'm still searching for answers.<br>
<br>
So, that's a little background on me.  I read the transcript of the debate between the apologist and Till, and I have to say I thought Till won that one big time (though there was obviously an audience hostile to him, from the notes about applause and reactions).  Basically, it seemed that his (the apologist--sorry I can't remember his name!) argument was that Jesus died and rose from the dead because the Bible said so.  He claims the Bible is believable because it was accurately copied so many times over a long period and provided eyewitness testimony of trustworthy people.  (How does he know these people were trustworthy?)  And I believe his other argument went something like, &quot;Well, you can't prove it didn't happen.&quot;  He didn't address any of the valid arguments brought up by Till, like:  How does something being copied accurately make it true?  (I'm sure the Qu'ran has been accurately copied for centuries--does that make it true?)  What about the Book of Mormon?  (No offense to Mormons here--this was part of Till's argument).  There were several reported eyewitnesses to these golden tablets.  Why do you (the apologist) not accept that as God's truth, if eyewitness accounts are acceptable proof?  What about the fact that almost all Biblical scholars agree that the gospels were NOT written by the disciples bearing their names and were not eyewitness accounts?  I have done a ton of reading about this, and it seems that a handful of fundamentalist scholars insist on Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John being the actual authors, but the arguments for this not being the case are overwhelming from a historical standpoint.  I'm not talking about skeptics trying to discredit the Bible, I'm talking about Christian scholars as well.  And if it is indeed not eyewitness testimony, his whole argument falls apart.  In his final statement, he said something like, &quot;What's the harm in believing?  If you're right, you receive eternal life.&quot;  I have to ask, exactly what kind of faith is that?  Are you *really* a believer if you have that attitude? (Gee, this doesn't make any sense, but I'll pretend it does just in case there's a hell).  And I have to agree with DBC's statement that since the Bible clearly was trying to further a cause, it is logical to not consider it a historical source on par with others which merely sought to record history.  I'm not saying it's NOT historical--just that by its purpose and nature it's reasonable to be more skeptical about it.<br>
<br>
As I've said, I am a Christian and I really wanted to be convinced by this guy...but I wasn't, not even a little.  I thought Till by far made the more logical arguments.  Maybe this is just a matter of faith, and either you have it or you don't.  I'm just not the kind of person who can make myself believe something that doesn't make sense to me, you know?  I started reading the Paul link but it was so long and I didn't have time...having read &quot;The Mythmaker&quot; I am really interested in what it has to say, so I'll try to read it later.  <br>
<br>
I don't mean any of this in any negative way toward you, Candy, I appreciate your efforts in this area.  I still need a lot more convincing, and I really want to see both sides of this.  So...got anything else? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This is widely cited as the best evidence of Jesus' historical existence. The claim rests upon a single paragraph in Josephus' &quot;Antiquities of the Jews.&quot; It reads as follows: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was (the) Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had him condemned to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> It must first be pointed out that Josephus was writing some six decades after the supposed crucifixion, so he would have had no first-hand knowledge of Jesus' existence. Josephus would have been working with second hand evidence at best.<br>
<br>
The passage is an obvious forgery and has been recognized as such by historians for over two centuries. Its brevity alone casts doubt on its authenticity. Josephus was a writer with a penchant for great detail on the most trivial matters. His works are tedious in their detailing the lives of minor criminals, customs officials, governmental economic figures, and the like. There are in fact six other Jesuses in his works; the one everybody knows today receives the shortest shrift, again illustrating just how unimportant he was considered to be by his contemporaries.<br>
<br>
In addition, the passage does not seem to fit sequentially with either the preceding or the subsequent paragraph. When one reads it in context, it stands out as something that occurred to the writer as an afterthought, and one is left with the distinct impression that it was added later. Such is indeed the case; most historians now recognize it as having been authored by the fourth-century Christian writer Eusebius.<br>
<br>
However, it is the wording of the paragraph itself that provides the most damaging testimony of the spuriousness of the passage. The writer refers to Jesus as &quot;the Christ&quot; and the whole paragraph has an undeniably pro-Christian flavor to it. Josephus was a devout Jew; he could not have written the passage. Finally, if all this were not enough, we possess copies of Josephus' work dating prior to Eusebius, and the passage is not in them. Obviously, the early church recognized the paucity of historical evidence supporting the actual existence of its central character. It is a telling tribute to the duplicitous nature of institutionalized Christianity that this forgery remains an obscure fact to so many people. Clearly, the dishonesty of the church's founders has been matched by their descendents who continue to cite Josephus' passage as if no one has ever refuted it. <br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
Another writer, Philo, was born some time before Jesus was alleged to have been miraculously conceived; he lived for many years after the alleged crucifixion. Philo lived in the same area and at the same time when Jesus was supposed to have performed his miracles. Many of his works have survived. If anybody were in a position to know and write of Jesus of Nazareth, it is Philo. Yet, the name of Jesus doesn't appear once in any of his voluminous surviving works.<br>
<br>
Dozens of other writers whose works have survived (including Pliny, Seutonius, Arrian, Juvenal and others) are likewise silent about Jesus. In fact, the first works that do refer to Jesus date from centuries later, and are written by devout Christians, not objective historians. <p><br>

The earliest physical remains of the cult date from around the end of the first century A.D., and Mithraism reached its height of popularity in the third century. In addition to soldiers, the cult's membership included significant numbers of bureaucrats and merchants. Women were excluded. Mithraism declined with the rise to power of Christianity, until the beginning of the fifth century, when Christianity became strong enough to exterminate by force rival religions such as Mithraism.&quot;<br>

<br>
Another problem I think you and I will always have with our discussions is that you have a negative view of Christianity, and I don’t…we’ve each studied it, or continue to study, and we’ve come to differing conclusions.  You choose to only see Him as a “war god”, I see the whole thing as a complete long unfolding story of His purpose …<br>

     Julie, first I want to encourage you to email me if there is ever anything you want to discuss or if you want help in understanding, particularly those contradictions and ethical problems you see.  Anytime, and we’ll see what we can’t work out together!<br>
     As far as the debate link…people tend to forget that any good apologist will not debate for the sake of simply “winning” …apologists are not out to win, only to give a reasonable defense.  That’s also why you will probably see me bow out of this discussion before too long, because as an apologist I can only present the information that I know and let others think it out for themselves (hopefully with an open-mind).<br>
<br>

     The reason for Christians to deny the Qu’ran as scripture is that specifically it denies the deity of Christ and his death on the cross as the atonement…those are pretty central teachings of the New Testaments.  There is no particularly good reason to accept it as inspired scripture.  He may have even been a particularly holy man and profound teacher, but we, as Christians,  can’t accept his recitations as inspired over the NT, especially when one believes that Jesus authenticated his claims of divinity with His resurrection.<br>
     Regarding the B o/ M…many may have seen the gold plates after JS received them, but it took even JS 4 years of visions before he was allowed to “Find them” and even then, there were no other witnesses actually with him, they did not see these plates until something like another 2 years down the road during the translation to the B o/M , so it’s not really comparable to the eyewitness accounts of those in the Bible where there were at least 1, 2, or more additional witnesses who were there and could also have verify what happened. (If I'm wrong in this little bit of JS history, please someone let me know so I can correct myself!) <br>
<br>
Back to DBC,  I agree with you about the paragraph you gave from Josephus – that’s why I haven’t brought it up, it has some apologetic value, but not extremely strong.<br>
     If Philo was a philosopher and not a historian, why would he have necessity to write about Jesus? Not sure I’m following that one.  Honest question here.<br>

Christianity was rooted in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Judaism</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which predates Mithraism by quite a bit. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Live your life so the preacher won't have to lie at your funeral.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tinlizzy@religiousdebate60574>TinLizzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#3333ff>(3/11/03 1:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Mithraism</span><hr size=1> Candy,<br>

That's my problem, though--I didn't really see a reasonable defense, I saw someone who passionately believes in the Bible say that it's true without any convincing evidence.  If you want to say it's a matter of faith, that's fine--I just don't think there's much point in trying to debate the subject without facts. <br>

&quot;The reason for Christians to deny the Qu’ran as scripture is that specifically it denies the deity of Christ and his death on the cross as the atonement…those are pretty central teachings of the New Testaments. There is no particularly good reason to accept it as inspired scripture. He may have even been a particularly holy man and profound teacher, but we, as Christians, can’t accept his recitations as inspired over the NT, especially when one believes that Jesus authenticated his claims of divinity with His resurrection.&quot;<br>
<br>
I understand this argument, but it presupposes the validity of the Bible.  The apologist had argued that the Bible had been accurately copied from its original form over many centuries, and that was suppose to be an argument for its accuracy.  My point was that the Qu'ran had also been accurately copied (according to Muslims, much more accurately than the Bible...this is one of their arguments for the Qu'ran being true) over many centuries, so using that argument for the Bible makes no sense.  How do you know the Bible is the truth?  To answer that question, you cannot start out assuming the Bible is true, then use it to discount other beliefs.  You have to show what it is about the Bible that makes it believable.  If most scholars are right and the gospels are not eyewitness accounts and were written *after* Paul wrote his letters and epistles which shaped the doctrine of the church, what argument exists to believe the accounts written in the gospels?  What about the fact that some of the gospel writers copied from others and changed certain details?  These are the kinds of things that bother me, and that I have never been able to find reasonable explanations for.  I know much of this is based on faith--but I can't just turn my brain off when it comes to these issues.  I don't need proof of everything I believe--but I do need it to be reasonable, and I do need to know there is not strong evidence to the contrary.  Does that make sense?<br>

I cannot recall his name nor where I read his stuff, but he has an open challenge.  It goes something like this....take the 4 gospels and lay them all out on one timeline.  Include all the hairsplitting references (it was dark when they set out, light when they arrived, dusk when they fled - there was one guard outside, there were 2 guards inside, there was one angel on a rock and 2 angels in the tomb - whatever) and make a composite gospel from all 4 versions ommiting <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>none</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the details.  <br>

It cannot be done, the conflicts in the stories are preclusive.  It is either innaccurate or false, it cannot be in full agreement and true.

A work that speaks of the deity of Christ and His resurrection as well as a work that does not, cannot both be true can they?  That's why as a Christian - believing that Christ is God and that He was resurrected - I can't believe the Qu'ran to also be inspired if it teaches contrary to this can I?  <br>

<br>
You espouse the islamic gov't as potentially wonderful were they to follow the true teachings, yet speaking against that stands the fact that despite the popularity of muslim faith in the muslim nations, none of them have yet successfully managed to institute that rule set.  The core problem is that without an actual god to measure against as a standard of these divine rules, a theocracy can say whatever it wants and characterize it as divine will and be unempeachable.  To my knowledge, Allah is not attending parlimentary sessions and vetoing or affirming anything.  He is an absentee landlord and in his absence the management has unrestriced rule.  <br>
<br>
People need equal protection under the law, and theocracies are in direct contravention to that.  To me, there is no particularly good reason to accept ANY of them.<br>

John E. Remsburg, in his classic book The Christ: A Critical Review and Analysis of the Evidence of His Existence (The Truth Seeker Company, NY, no date, pp. 24-25), lists the following writers who lived during the time, or within a century after the time, that Jesus is supposed to have lived: <br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Josephus<br>

According to Remsburg, &quot;Enough of the writings of the authors named in the foregoing list remains to form a library. Yet in this mass of Jewish and Pagan literature, aside from two forged passages in the works of a Jewish author (note: I presume this to be Josephus), and two disputed passages in the works of Roman writers, there is to be found no mention of Jesus Christ.&quot; Nor, we may add, do any of these authors make note of the Disciples or Apostles - increasing the embarrassment from the silence of history concerning the foundation of Christianity. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Okay, that said, can you see why Bertrand Russell said, &quot;Historically it is quite doubtful whether Christ ever existed at all, and if he did we do not know anything about him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Or that your reply &quot;Was this guy serious? Me thinks he should've done a bit more digging for information before making such comments...&quot; is actually the weaker (though admittedly more popular) position?<br>

We don't live in a perfect democracy either, but that doesn't mean we toss it out.  The problem as I see it is twofold: either you get some dictator over there who is only nominally Muslim and is using Islam as a tool (Saddam Hussien is a perfect example.. he'll quote the Qur'an or Hammurabi, or whoever he can to try and keep his stranglehold); or a group of people decide to &quot;become and Islamic country&quot; but out of ignorance or ulterior motives or misguidedness or whatever, it becomes a hell hole.  A lot of this I think is cultural.. it's disgusting how the level of testosterone flies through the roof, and they drag some poor woman out and stone her just to show how &quot;Islamic&quot; they are, forgetting that Islam is a holistic system -- you can't apply one part without applying it in its entirety, and if you're just starting out you don't begin with capital punishment, for crying out loud (wanted to say something stronger there, tryin' to keep it clean <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )!<br>

Actually the ideal Islamic government looks a lot like the US government.  Most of the guiding principles are the same.<br>

<br>
That's why there's supposed to be a system of checks and balances (sound familiar?). .. and if I lived in Saudi I too would have to do whatever I could to try and &quot;reform the system&quot;, not only out of personal conviction that they're wrong, but out of religious mandate as well.  Unfortunately so many other elements are at play over there, the only forseeable way to major change is through popular revolt.. which often brings in the extremist band into play (they always remind me of the Monty Python crowd when they're deciding what to do with the witch), then people can't live that way either so they go back to a dictator type, and the cycle begins again.  That's why I'm so sceptical about the whole &quot;reformed Palestinian government&quot;.  Nobody hopes that works more than me, but to be perfectly honest I am not optimistic.<br>

It cannot be revised or changed to discard outdated materials like concepts regarding homosexuality, gender and science.  It cannot be refined to distinctly point out and enumerate situational subtleties that were possibly not captured in the original.  The US is constitution based and completely revisable by the gov't (much to our dismay at times.)  The fact remains as well that by having a benevolent gov't founded on the practice of a religeon you have reduced members of the population in their freedoms and stature to the gov't who do not practise the prevailing theology.  They are made to feel as outsiders in their own lands. <p><br>

<br>
Sure it can.  That's the whole big humongous overwhelming problem with both Muslims and non-Muslims on this issue.  There are very very few elements in the Qur'an that are absolute.. what we need these days is a reinterpretation, and it's not just little ol' me posting here who thinks so, but many many of the best and brightest of our scholars (most of whom can't live anywhere in the Middle East or risk being arrested)... I mean, if you take an honest look at early Islamic history, there were no absolutes.. the law was shifted to accommodate the circumstances.  For example, during the time of the Caliph Umar, one of the most highly regarded personages in Islam, he frequently abandoned implementation of certain Islamic rules when the situation warranted it... he also placed women in high places of power, like heading up the central marketplace, etc.  Try something like that now in many Muslims countries and it's &quot;Off with your head!&quot; -- literally.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying Islamic goverment is a substitute for a secular one.  Obviously, if you're not Muslim you will have some issues, but it should be a decent place to live, where non-Muslims may very well choose to live because life is good there, regardless of what the overriding theology is.  Unfortunately the only non-Muslims I know of who want to live in Muslim-majority countries these days are people who want to a) make a lot of money and/or b) convert the populace to another faith.  The countries have not made it pleasant enough to want to live there simply for the sake of the overall society (although I hear some countries are making progress -- like Qatar, Bahrain...)<br>
