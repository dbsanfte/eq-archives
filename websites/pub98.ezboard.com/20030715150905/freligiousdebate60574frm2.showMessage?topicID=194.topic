I was reading the War in Iraq board a minute ago...not that I can usually stomach that one too long...a lot of those people seem awfully...bloodthirsty, I guess...<br>
<br>
Anyway, I saw where you responded to the thread about Iraqi protestors and said that you felt the US might not like what the Iraqis want. <br>
<br>
I wasn't really all that thrilled about this war to begin with, and one of the reasons why is because I thought the administration had not fully thought through what the post war situation would be. I also think our foreign policy is a bit hypocritical in that we are all gung ho for people deciding what government they want...as long as they do it the way we want them to. If the Iraqi people were to form some sort of theocracy with some democratic elements similar to Iran, I don't think the White House would be too thrilled, you know?<br>
<br>
What I wanted to ask you though, since you are obviously more cognizant of Islamic culture than I <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , is what the religious situation in Iraq actually is. I think I have read that most Iraqis are Shiite and Saddam and his people were Sunni. What is the difference between the two? Do you think that the Iraqis really want a more Islamic government as some of the protestors in Baghdad seemed to want? Could the Sunni and Shiite sides of Islam coexist in a theocracy?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I was just curious as to what you thought about all of this. Obviously, I am not expert but the war's aftermath was one thing I wondered about. While I think Saddam was/is a really cruel and awful person and leader, I don't think we do any service to the Iraqis (or our national security for that matter) if we leave the country in a state of anarchy or constant civil war.<br>
<br>
Hope this makes sense. I have tried to learn a little more about Islam but I admit to being fairly ignorant on the details! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Well, to be perfectly honest, I am not optimistic.<br>
<br>
There are several different religious groups in there, and since I believe most/all of them were supressed to one degree or another over the years, either they will all respect each other's desire to be religiously liberated and they'll all live as one big happy family, or they'll start fighting with one another and possibly ultimately split.<br>
<br>
Just for the record, I am Sunni.  There are some fundamental differences between Shi'ites and Sunnis, and unfortunately in recent history I have heard more of cases where they oppressed one another rather than supported or even tolerated each other.  I think it will be difficult for them to form a theocracy, because one group will have to be acknowledged as the &quot;guys in charge&quot;.. it's similar to the problems we've seen in Ireland.. both sides are Christian, but they still have issues.<br>
<br>
With Islam it will be more difficult than in the Christian example, because laws for governance are very plainly laid out, at least for the Sunnis (I am not as well-versed on the details of Shi'ite doctrine in this area).  I think it will depend on how &quot;hard-line&quot; the leaders are going to be about it.. I've heard interviews of &quot;the man on the street&quot;, lol, and for now there seems to be great brotherhood among all the groups because of their shared misery.. once they start moving beyond that stage (which hopefully they will), I'm not sure what will happen.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for the US, the Iraqis are already starting to be opinionated, lol, and I can't imagine they will take very well to being &quot;led&quot; in any direction by outside powers.  There's just too much negative history in the region stemming from colonialism, etc.  I am very interested to see where that will lead, because I can see already from the comments I've read over at BC, that although we supposedly did all this to set the Iraqi people free, we still expect them to do what we want them to do -- that's not really freedom, is it?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, I don't know that I gave you very good answers, but these are my opinions..<br>

I know you must be busy....I can't imagine the homeschooling planning you do can be done fast, LOL.<br>
<br>
I have to say I am not optimistic about the future of Iraq either. And I think the US trying to force them into the mold of what ~we~ believe they should have as a government will only make the situation worse.  It really seems to me that the Bush administration went into Iraq thinking they could get rid of Saddam and all the sudden, a pro-Western secular democracy was going to spring up. Which is more than a bit naive...<br>
<br>
I do think the other mistake the administration is making is not allowing the UN a greater role in rebuilding the country. Perhaps it wouldn't make any difference but I think that the US taking charge tends to automatically set people's teeth on edge moreso than a multi-national UN led reconstruction would. (That darn &quot;cultural imperialists&quot; thing rearing its head again....)<br>
<br>
But then no one in the administration likely cares what my opinion is....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
On a side note, are the Kurds Muslim? I had thought they were but I saw some news reports that suggested their religious beliefs were much different than the average Muslim.<br>

I wonder if the US had really expected the religious leaders in Iraq to immediately take up the strong leadership role they have.  I know I've heard of some miscellaneous people trying to establish themselves as local leaders, but I don't think anyone has gotten the kind of following the religious guys have. Coming from the (supposedly) SOCAS background our leaders have, I wonder how well they'll be able to deal with that.<br>

&quot;Coming from the (supposedly) SOCAS background our leaders have, I wonder how well they'll be able to deal with that.&quot;<br>
<br>
That was one of the things that I was thinking about when I was reading that study on the Kurds. In the cultural section, it discussed how Americans might do things that in Kurdish culture would send the totally wrong message. I think a lot of our leaders never thought about how to deal with this in an Iraqi mindset and thought only in terms of American values and standards. Personally, I wonder how they will react when they realize their mistake. (Assuming they do realize it, LOL)<br>

I was coming here to ask you a question as well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Whole different topic though, so I hope you check back.<br>
<br>
I am writing two sermons one on Love and one on Pride.  I can quote the Bible verses on both (as well as many other quotes from other sources), but I'm having trouble finding Koran verses.  (maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places.  Could you help me out a bit??<br>
<br>
Just anything that comes to mind would be cool.  (ex- the Bible says there are 2 kinds of pride [see post below too], Bible verses such as &quot;There is no fear in Love, for perfect love casts out fear&quot;; &quot;love thy neighbor...&quot;)<br>
<br>
Is there a good Koran website like the Bible ones, where I can search by word or topic?<br>
<br>
Thanks a bunch!!<br>
Kelly<br>
(which spelling of Koran is preferred??  Koran...Qur'an... )<br>
