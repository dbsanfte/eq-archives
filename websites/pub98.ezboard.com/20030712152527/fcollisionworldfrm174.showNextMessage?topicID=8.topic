&quot;What a nice night.&quot; He said to himself.<br>
The stars twinkled brightly in the clear night sky. He walked along the path for several minutes, but to him it seemed like hours. He looked down to the ground and said,<br>
&quot;Why did I run? I'm a warrior born. Am... Am I a coward?&quot;<br>
He neared the center of the graveyard. Forte looked up to see where he was. Bones were scattered all over the place, the tombstones lay in ruined, and the few poplar trees that stood looked as lifeless as stone. <br>
&quot;Wow! Looks like there was a battle here.&quot;<br>
Forte turned and saw a huge building right behind him. It was covered with dead vines and surrounded with dead flowers. There was a smell coming from the building which grew stronger in time.<br>
&quot;The smell of death is in the air. I better get off the ground soon just in case.&quot;<br>
Forte climbed a poplar tree that stood not to far from the building. As Forte sat in the tree he grew tired. He thought he seen something move. He looked over to the building and saw a strange figure in a black cloak. The figure closed the door and said,<br>
&quot;Soon my army of the dead will rise and we will rule.&quot;<br>
The figure turned and saw Forte in his tree. He quickly reached into a pocket a pulled out a handful of fine black sand.<br>
&quot;This is your invitation to a deep sleep.&quot;<br>
The figure threw the sand at Forte and he soon fell asleep.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 204<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/18/03 4:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm174.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dark Knight</span><hr size=1> &quot;Hmph.  Pixie dust.  What a cheap magician's trick.&quot;<br>
<br>
Out from the shadows appeared a tall man clad in black, tattered velvet robes, a hood covering his pallid features.  His long broadsword gleamed in the faint light of the stars.  He stepped over the death, unphased by the stench and the stillness.  He was a part of it.<br>
<br>
Violet eyes gleamed from beneath the hood, narrowing into slits of disgust at the dark figure who had sent the warrior born into a faerie land far away.  The stranger pointed his gleaming sword at the offender. &quot;Huh.  Is that the best you can do, blackguard?&quot; he spat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zero@collisionworld>Zero</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/20/03 8:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm174.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Friend or Foe?</span><hr size=1> The sand had Forte held in a realm of pure hell.<br>
&quot;No I won't lose... not like this.&quot;<br>
The spell wore off, and Forte awoke. He looked around to see if he was still in the graveyard. <br>
&quot;Damn he woke up... but still your fate is sealed.&quot;<br>
The figure turned to face the Dark Knight.<br>
&quot;Now you will face the same fate as the fool behind me.&quot;<br>
Forte tried to stand but he was still weak from the spell.<br>
He seen a small amount of the sand on his cloak. Forte examined the sand and found out how deadly it really is. <br>
&quot;Death but how?&quot;<br>
Forte stood and with every ounce of strength he could muster he drew his sword and got ready to attack.<br>
The figure spoke to the Dark Knight.<br>
&quot;Before you die I will tell you where the cure is. It is where death itself resides. Death sleeps at this very spot but deep beneath our feet.&quot;<br>
CLANK. With all of his might Forte had jumped form his tree nearly 30 feet away and struck down the enemy. He stood there for a moment, sweat dripping form his forehead. He looked at the Dark Knight and said,<br>
&quot;Friend or Foe? If you are a friend help me if you can, if you are a foe then strike me down where I stand.&quot;<br>
Forte fell to his knees in pain, he threw off his cloak and looked at his left arm. It was turning green and he could no longer move it.<br>
&quot;Am I to die like this.&quot;  <br>

She had fallen in the fight, and her wrist had been cut by his sword.  Badly.  Blood poured upon the stone ground of the courtyard, yet she looked up at him, unphased by the ghastly wound.  <br>
<br>
Strike me down where I stand...you won, didnt you? End it!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The &quot;Dark Knight&quot; ripped back his hood.  His eyes were sharp violet, his pupil slitted slightly.  His hair was unkempt and looked like it had once been blonde, but matted and mud soaked beyond recognition.  His face was smeared with blood, but not his own.  Their was something unsettling about is stare that told Forte something was not right in the man's mind.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I am neither friend nor foe to you!&quot; he spat.  &quot;I came to check the graves...for...&quot; he looked distraught, but shook his head clear.  &quot;I...will help you.&quot;  He fumbled through his robes, armor glimmering dully beneath, scorched and blood tainted.  He pulled out a vial, mumbling thanks to someone Forte could not see.  He brought it to the warrior's lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;This...Athena made this...&quot; he whispered, not really to Forte, but to no one in particular.  &quot;A Deathalt Dram...procured, from the very depths of the shadow realm...this is your cure.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ardeth took in a staggering breath and gritted his teeth, as he poured the remnant of the vial into Forte's mouth.  The ragged appearance, the staggering way he walked, all came into place as he was close enough for even Forte to see the dark crimson stain gleaming through his robes, fortelling a ghastly wound beneath.  A sabre had taken him there...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Where is she, shapeshifter?&quot; Kuja had demanded.<br>

<br>
&quot;Do not fool with me, Ardeth!&quot; Kuja lunged forward and ran his sabre through his shoulder before he could react, and ripped back, letting him fall into a void.<br>

He looked at his arm and it was slowly regaining its normal color and its movement.<br>
&quot;Thank you for helping me.&quot;<br>
Forte looked at the wounded warrior and a thought crossed his mind<br>
*Man I wish I could help him like he helped me but I have no supplies.*<br>
&quot;I hope your friends will find you soon. I can't help you, I'm sorry.&quot;<br>
Forte looked down at the ground. His cloak lay stained with the blood of the creature he had killed. He put his cloak back on and looked for the dead body but it was nowhere to be found.<br>
&quot;That was a fatal blow, there is no way he could have survived.&quot;<br>
&quot;You have underestimated me Forte, I can't be killed that easily.&quot;<br>
The cloaked figure came out of the building once again.<br>
&quot;Rise my army of the dead. Rise to kill these two pests.&quot;<br>
The ground started to shake violently and crack open as  the dead started to come out from beneath the earth.<br>
&quot;Damn I won't be able to take these guys out while watching out for him.&quot;<br>
Forte looked over to the wounded warrior and said.<br>
&quot;Run! Run now while you still have the chance, I'll try to hold them as long as I can.&quot;<br>
Forte looked straight ahead at the Zombie army and said,<br>

He frowned at his words.  He did not blame him for not being able to help...oh Gods, the pain was so bad...it racked his body from the central point where Kuja's damned sabre had pierced his breast.  &quot;Friends...?&quot;  His thoughts immediately went to Athena, the Dragoness, the stoic warrior.  But why?  Athena was far from his friend.  She was far from anyone's friend...<br>
<br>
As the dead surfaced from the earth, they cackled and shrieked from toothless, chapless jaws, clutching at his robes and pulling him into their grasp, smelling of death and dirt, he let them pull him the rest of the way to the ground, knowing he would soon join them.  They craved the blood that flowed from his wound.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me die,&quot; he rasped moaningly, to no one in particular.  &quot;Just leave me be...and let me die.  Fend for yourself...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eeeeeeek!&quot;<br>
<br>
The shrill cry of the undead rang suddenly in Ardeth's ears, as the skeletons and half-decayed bodies of the monsters shrank back into their graves, shriveling and writhing.<br>
<br>
A tall, dark figure appeared from the misty night, eyes glowing blue with power through the fog.  Undead soldiers ran at her with swords, but there was a flash and a metallic ring and twenty or so of the zombies went flying headless or worse to the ground, more screams emitting into the night.<br>
<br>
The slender figure came into view.  Her eyes cold and sapphire, lips dark ruby.  Pale white skin and midnight black hair that ran down her shoulders.  Armor that gleamed, and a gauntlet whose armblades were stained in the tainted blood of the undead.  They saw her, the zombies, and hissed, and demanded who was she to disturb them.<br>
<br>
&quot;No need to introduce myself to those already dead,&quot; she spat darkly, cutting off the head of the nearest offender.<br>
<br>
&quot;Athena...?&quot; Ardeth coughed, blood flecking his lips.<br>
<br>
She spotted him, and, with a short, uncaring glance at Forte, advanced toward him in a steady pace.  The unholy minions who dared come near her crumpled and bowed at her, as if she were their queen.  She certainly looked the part.<br>
<br>
Athena knelt down beside him, taking him into her arms gently.  Her eyes softened at the sight of his wound, but were still as placid as twin lakes.  She held him to her, her hand pressed firmly against the sword wound.  Blue light lined her palm and her eyes, and the power of her healing caused the man in her grasp to pass out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Never thought you would need ::me::, Ardeth,&quot; she said quietly.<br>
<br>
He looked at her through half-lidded eyes before falling back into slumber.  She picked his large frame up with one arm, holding him up so he stood leaning against her, head slumped over her shoulder.  Her other hand was outstretched towards the creature who had summoned the undead, and even without saying a spell, a great blue ball of energy sprouted from her fingertips, and hurled itself towards the death bringer, obliterating at least thirty zombies in its path without ever losing strength. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zero@collisionworld>Zero</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(3/24/03 7:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm174.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Friends</span><hr size=1> Forte watched as the rest of the zombies ran for their lives.<br>

He looked down at the remains of the zombie leader. There was blood everywhere. He looked at himself to see if the blast also hit him. It hadn't touched him but it scorched his bio armor a bit. He looked back over at Athena, she was walking toward the entrance of the graveyard when Forte said,<br>
&quot;Athena may I join you? I have nothing to do and nowhere to go. I may be of some use to you.&quot;<br>

Then, ignoring Forte, she picked up Ardeth's large figure in her seemingly frail arms and began to walk away.  She was finished here.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your friend healed me with one of your potions.&quot;<br>

Athena paused for a moment, turned her head slightly to Forte's voice.  &quot;Of course he did,&quot; she nodded, before continuing on her way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Athena may I join you? I have nothing to do and nowhere to go. I may be of some use to you.&quot;<br>

Athena stopped dead in her tracks, not surprised by the words but amused by his thoughts.  Kill him or let him join...hah.  That was a fine extreme.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be of use to me...?&quot; she smirked rudely.  She never smiled at all, a smirk was all she could afford him.  She looked him up and down, examining his bio armor, his features.  *He looks strong enough...but of course brawn never does make up for brains,* she thought cynically.  *Kill him? No.  A waste of a good sharpened sword.  He may be a burden...of course, we'll know soon enough.*<br>
<br>
She shrugged lightly and nonchalantly.  &quot;Follow me, stay here, whichever way you wish...do what you will.  It matters not to me.&quot;  And she kept going. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right
