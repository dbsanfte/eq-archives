This was his fault. Part of him knew it and part of him did not care. But there was some part, possibly just being created or just waking up, that felt sick from what had happened. His hand went for the gun and this time he didn't stop it. If any vamp had some how survived the sudden burst of light, they would quickly meet their end with one of George's bullets.<br>
<br>
He started to limp in the direction the girl went.

Even though he'd said he was ok, he had looked pretty beat up and she hoped he'd take Vania's advice and find the medical station.<br>
<br>
Turning her face back to the front, Taylee noticed that they were exiting the city once again. And then Vania was pulling the curtain aside and pushing Taylee into the darkness. At first Taylee couldn't see anything accept the solid blackness that comes with a sudden change in the level of light, and then it was too late...she felt the impact as Vania kicked out, and smelled the sweet metallic scent she knew too well. Blood. The echo of running footsteps brought her head up, listening, but they were moving away, and it was then that she knew she was alone.<br>
<br>
Taylee turned back, hurrying towards the city. It was her only hope...she knew what was out there waiting in the dark. As she got closer she could hear the commotion of people. Someone was screaming. And as she raised the curtain, breathing a sigh of relief to be back in the light, suddenly everything went black. 'No,' she thought, 'not here.' They were coming....she knew it down to the very core of her being. 'Could I have brought this on,' she asked herself as the light clicked back on flooding the city once again.<br>
<br>
She turned horrified eyes on the scene presenting itself in front of her. The screams seemed distant like something muffled and unreal, as she watched the vampires burn. And where they had stood multiple bodies littered the ground.<br>
<br>
In shock Taylee crouched down, shaking. What was she going to do now.<br>
<br>
<br>

She looked at his hand for a moment before placing her hand in his and shaking it. &quot;I-I'm Taylee,&quot; she sighed taking her hand back before continuing, &quot;I don't have anywhere else to go. Vania...the girl that brought me here was taken...just now,&quot; she gestured to the entrance curtain, &quot;by them.&quot; <br>
<br>
She turned back to the man, &quot;and I am unfamiliar with this city.&quot; Maybe he knew his way around down here, &quot;we need to tell someone that they have Vania.&quot; she usually didn't stick her neck out for someone she barely knew but the other girl had saved her and brought her here, showing her there was hope, &quot;someone needs to rescue her, &quot; she added knowing full well what the Vampires would probably do to the girl. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blindeserra@kalaberia>Blinde Serra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/11/03 2:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A twisted turn of events.</span><hr size=1> With his tounge lolling from his mouth, a soft yip of pleasure escapes him as Taylea scratches his ears.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>oh how fingers feel wonderful!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thinks to himself. He gives a quick affectionate lick to her hand to show his appreciation. <br>
<br>
Looking up at Cynthia questioningly a moment, he quickly trots after Vania and Taylea, smelling the apprehension on Vania. As she pushes past a curtain into a very dark room, he flutters his eye lids quickly, dowsing the glowing blue orbs briefly to help adjust to the deeper darkness. The scent of Death was on the air.<br>
<br>
The great wolf stunned sudden violence displayed before him, howls angrily! Vania falls quickly before he can do anything.  A blinding flash of light brings to view many vampires bursting into flame. Howling angrily into the room, he looks quickly about. Taking note of Cynthia standing next to him, he sighs a soft huff of relief quiets his menacing growl still burning in his throat.<br>
<br>
As Taylea speaks, he turns his massive head to her, obvious intelligence lurking behind his pale eyes. A sticcato bark pierces the air as she mentions rescue. A serious cast to his wolfen face shows his acceptance, and understanding. <br>
<br>
A look of curious contemplation quickly sweeps his face, uncertain how to communicate his intentions and desires at the moment. Another softer more drawn out <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wuff</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> echos in the still air.<br>

<br>
As she looked down at the large beast it almost seemed that he could understand what she was saying.A thought began to worm it's way into her mind as she looked back at George, then over to Cynthia, and finally down at the wolf. 'Could?' she wondered, 'could he....be a were?' She didn't really know anything about the species, and so kept her thoughts to herself as she looked back at George unsure if he could help or not.

Wouldn't surprise me if you were. Seems my whole life is going in the direction I've tried to keep it from going up till now.&quot; Out of nervous habit, his 45 cal. six shooter found its way into his holster, then back out again. Using his left hand he fished out a ciggarette and reached for his lighter. Instead he found nothing. Another curse escaped his mouth.<br>
<br>
Looking around, George saw that smoke was still rising form some of the vamps ashes, and eventually he caught sight of the slightest flame on the side of someone's clothes. Limping over calmly, he put the cancer stick to the flame and then replaced it in his mouth. &quot;So, what now?&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A> at: 7/12/03 8:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/12/03 7:00 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rose-needles.net/tayav.jpg width=134 height=190></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Reconigition~something clicks</span><hr size=1> As Taylea stood waiting to see if the others had any ideas on what they should do, she began to notice a sound....something that nagged at the edge of her mind.

<br>
When she turned to George the sound got louder, and looking down she saw him unholstering and then reholstering his gun. A nervous habit....something they would call a tell in poker. And that's when it hit her...the sound. She'd heard it in the park. The man in the shadows...the one that had told her he would be the one to kill her. Her heart began to pound and her breathing become shallow as she watched him. Did he know. Was he here to kill her.<br>
<br>
Taylea watched as he took out a cigarette then began looking for a light, all the while edging farther from him slowly. When he turned, moving over to a still burning corpse, she made her move.

<br>
Taking a heavy sigh she started walking back to where George was trying to get to his feet.&quot;This is probably one of the stupidest things I've done....and I still don't trust the fact that you wont try to kill me..&quot; shaking her head at his attempt to gains his feet, she held out a hand, &quot;....but on the other hand I really don't want to go back out there. I don't know where Vania's rooms were really...except that they're close by.&quot; <br>
<br>
Taylea frowned as she looked around for something that looked familiar, when her eyes landed on the wolf again, and an idea formed, &quot;maybe the wolf can track the way back to her place.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/14/03 12:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reconigition~something clicks</span><hr size=1> Ignoring the hand, George finally managed to regain his ground, but it was painful. &quot;Well, if you don't know where the place is then I guess I'm going to have to get rid of you,&quot; George told her, more serious than he usually is.

<br>
Turning to the wolf, a smile still on his lips, he asked, &quot;Well, how 'bout wolfie?

Cynthia starts walking toward the apartment hand lightly playing with the hairs on Alexander's head with tears sliding down her checks and anger deep in her brown eyes. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:maroon;font-family:courier;font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So I live so i die, either way time goes on.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/15/03 9:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reconigition~something clicks</span><hr size=1> George's hands came together in a mocking applause. &quot;That was beautiful,&quot; he said sarcastically. &quot;Right up there, with 'I have a dream' and a monolouge from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Man of La Mancha</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Tell me, how many nano seconds did it take you to figure out why the lights went out?&quot; Shaking his head, George limped after the girl. &quot;The chance for to destroy 70 vamps at once?

&quot;The came here for sovereignty for sanctuary we violated that trust and... and I well kill that which violated that trust that bond and the honor of all of us who built that.  I have always been true to my word and they changed that by doing this.” <br>
Cynthia puts George down<br>
“sorry but I am partially responsible for these people I was a line of defense but now I well hunt the vampires and I well find out about those who did this and they well wish they did not or they at least warned our citizens”<br>

She knew why he hadn't taken it...he didn't want to touch the ghoul. But then again he had shaken hands with her before. She shrugged, 'probably doesnt want to look weak by letting a girl help him.'<br>
<br>
When Cynthia started talking Taylee turned her attention on the girl. It was a relief to know that this girl knew her way around the city, and as she began walking away, leading them to Vania's place Taylee followed. <br>
<br>
She heard George's sarcastic comments, and turned her head giving him a sidlong look just in time to see Cynthia grab him by the neck. She listened to Cynthia defend the words she'd spoken earlier,  indifferent to the pain George must be feeling. Afterall his little 'joke' about getting rid of her didn't cause her to feel much sympathy for him. <br>
<br>
After Cynthia had let him down and finished what she was saying Taylee looked him in the eye, asking,&quot;Does it even bother you that because of what just happened Vania's out ther right now?&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taylea>Taylea</A> at: 7/15/03 11:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhampirlordofmallorea>Dhampir Lord of Mallorea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/15/03 11:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back to Vania's</span><hr size=1> After Cynthia let him go, George tried to shrug it off by cracking his neck. &quot;Let's not get too friendly, eh?&quot; he told her, again finding solice in movie quotes. &quot;I don't like you, and I'm sure you don't like me right now, but you wanna destroy vamps, and I'm all for that. I also have something to say to those geniuses that cut off the lights. After all, I was in here with them and I couldn't even see to fire my gun.&quot; Patting his leg, he added an afterthought. &quot;Plus, my broken leg isn't exactly putting me in the best mood.&quot;<br>
<br>
George heard Taylee's words (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Already refering to her by her nick name are, we?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ), but he didn't care. &quot;And to answer your question, miss, no it doesn't bother me in the least because it is her and not me.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkalaberia.showUserPublicProfile?gid=knightspasr>knightspasr</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://stu.aii.edu/~job312/werespider.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>~Kalaberia Citizen~</i></span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#8B4513>(7/16/03 12:12 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://stu.aii.edu/~job312/werespider.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back to Vania's</span><hr size=1> “Taylee, we might not be able to get to her, and if we did and this city fell what would it be worth.
