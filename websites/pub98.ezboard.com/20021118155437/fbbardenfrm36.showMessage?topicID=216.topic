Now I have adsl I often stay connected most of the day, even when away from computer. All this week msn has been starting itself up every time that I open outlook express when connected to the net. It didn't used to do this. I want to stop it doing this. Anyone know how to stop it from doing this? <p><BR><CENTER>===Silva===</CENTER><BR><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.aowm60.dsl.pipex.com/">Silva's World</A></CENTER><BR><CENTER><A HREF="http://pub11.ezboard.com/bsilvasrainbowdome">Silva's Rainbow Dome</A></CENTER>

They have linked Outlook Express and MSN together. So whenever you load OE it uses the MSN buddy list in your OE contacts.<br>
<br>
AFAIK there isn't a way to stop this, but I will take a look through <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
It is possible to de-link the program from loading unofficially but it has an annoying habit of borking the damn Outlook Express (OE) load process and MSN too sometimes as they are both tightly linked (will tell you how if you like but don't blame me if it goes wrong :P).<br>
<br>
Basically the only way you are gonna stop it auto signing in is by deselecting the &quot;save my username/password&quot; option. That way you need to enter your password whenever it loads. So when OE loads it will load MSN and then ask for your password and therefore you make the decision wether to sign in or not.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> MSN Settings</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Open Windows Messenger (MSN) and go into Tools &gt; Options, then on the dialog select the Preferences tab, and the first radio button 'Run this program when Windows starts' - disable this if you want it removed from startup. Of course you can also go into System Config yourself and disable any programs that run when your pc logs-on...<br>
<br>
Secondly..<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Outlook (Express)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Go into Tools &gt; Options. This time you want to select the General tab, and the 4th radio button down, is 'Automatically log onto Windows Messenger'. You want to disable this probably, so that when you open your Outlook Express, Windows Messenger does not open with it.<br>
<br>
I hope this is what you are looking for.

I went to the Windows Update site and upgraded to IE 6 and then the latest service pack... still no damn option in Outlook Express! So I reinstalled MSN Messenger and voila it appeared.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't know if this was anything to do with the upgrade to IE 6 or wether MSN hadn't installed properly the first time, now I think I remember that my machine was being very annoying when I installed it, maybe that's the reason.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this topic seems to have come to a closure with a solution ;)<br>
