<br>
I haven't forgotten you, or your reply to my message.  I've been thinking over what you've said, and how you've stated it.  I do wonder if it isn't the way I was brought up, but the quick answer I have for you would be that when one is defending oneself it is not with the intention of revenge or gain, it would be just to have what abuse is being given stopped, is that necessarily selfish?  How far one has to go to have it stopped is certainly a matter of debate, not to mention circumstances and people involved and each of their intents?  Conflict is a difficult thing for me, and though I went through so much as a child with it, I have not been convinced or convicted that physical defense is against God's Will.  Christ dying on the cross served a specific purpose and plan that God willed.  Martyrs have a stage in which there are observers and their testimony is seen and have been/can be used by God. Others dying becomes situational, of course only God knows if one is going to die or not. If it's not within God's will that a person will be rescued they will not be rescued regardless of force used or not.  On the same hand can a person be killed without God's permission?  This leads to many more questions for me.<br>
<br>
This doesn't mean I disagree with you in principle, but not every circumstance will hold up under scrutiny, especially with God defending so many in the Bible so many different ways. I don't know if you've been faced with it before, but on another board it was asked, &quot;Why if God is all-powerful, does He not interfere with the wars and situational conflicts with others?&quot; To emphasize the point they mentioned circumstances in which to stop an action God could just make the offenders blind or paralyzed, why must there be death?  Doesn't this mean God cut them off from ever possibly making a decision for Him?  It gets more convoluted from there, I assure you. <br>
<br>
I'm not looking for a 'fight' or even a 'debate' in the sense you might be used to.  I hope you understand what I'm trying to explain in my limited manner.  <br>
<br>
And though this is directed specifically at Eliashoi, I welcome any and all comments on the subject.  I went way down the field of just meekness and 'turning the other cheek', I think.  So I started this thread.<br>
<br>
God bless,<br>

<br>
I appreciate your post. The issue is not an easy one. I believe I stated that I don’t believe you have to be a personal pacifist to be a Christian, but I do believe that as we become more and more conformed to His image, and as we get less and less invested in our own interests, we will naturally go in that direction. <br>
<br>
I think the entire issue is put forth succinctly in a scripture you offered in the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Forgiveness</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thread:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Romans 12:18:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The subject is touchy, and I have been accused of being not only wrong, but of being in opposition to the gospel by some over on PC. But I think the scriptures teach by continuous implication, and by some explicit text, that we are to put our very lives into God’s hands, and that we are to trust Him for all things including our own safety. When I consider all that I have gained, and all that I stand yet to gain from the surpassing riches which are hid in Christ, that trust and complete surrender seem appropriate.<br>
<br>
There is no question that one who attacks you or yours, regardless of motivation, is committing a fundamentally evil act. But my theology (and frankly my own experience) teaches me that I was in the same state until Jesus rescued me. I was involved in acts of self-interest, which can only be accurately defined as evil. As Jesus died for me while I was dead in my sins, so I believe we ought to, as much as lies within us, interact with other sinners using the same mercy God showed to us. I believe that if we do so because of our surrender to God, God will bless us, and will often use that powerful witness to move the heart of the one attacking us.<br>
<br>
There are so many scriptures that teach such an emptying of self. I shared many of them already and won’t re-post them here unless you want me to. The fact is that when I read things like (paraphrased from memory) “have this same mind which was in Jesus, who was God, but who emptied Himself and was obedient to death on a cross”, “return good for evil”, “I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live…”, “Be ye merciful, as God is merciful”, “love your enemies…” and the myriad other scriptures of the same ilk, I am moved to embrace total surrender to and trust of God, and willingness to be spent by Him in whatever fashion will glorify His name.<br>
<br>
That these are not necessarily “proof texts” is undeniable. Loopholes have been carefully constructed over the ages, and most feel comfortable with the “yes but…” approach to these concepts. But I was lost, and am now found. I was blind, but now I see. I cannot in good conscience deny what I see as the fundamental thrust of self-denial that flows through the scriptures.<br>
<br>
I believe this is a personal issue of the heart, and that it flows out of relationship with God. I could defend myself, but Jesus didn’t. I have no need to defend myself, for my life is not precious to me. Jesus is precious to me.<br>
<br>
I’m not sure if this makes sense to anybody else, but it is clear to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I appreciate your thoughts, I really do.  I will bow out from pushing some issues, since I have caught up with what's gone on at PC with this issue.  The last thing I intend is to put you 'through the fire' so to speak on a theological issue.  I would like to ask you a question though, if you don't mind.  If someone stepped in and rescued you, or your family by using what means was necessary to stop a crime being committed on you or your family, would you condemn them?  Would you say &quot;No thanks.&quot; ? <br>
<br>
I'm really interested in what you think on this matter.  I also know we all are working on ourselves, trying to become as Christlike as possible, and live according to God's will.  <br>
<br>
Thanks so much for being kind and patient with me,<br>

No. It is not my job to condemn others. We must all live before God and in the presence of our own consciences.<br>
