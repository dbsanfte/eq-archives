bar and demanded, &quot;Gimme a <br>
double of the strongest whiskey you got! <br>
I'm so upset I can't even see straight!&quot; <br>
<br>
The bartender, noticing that the little <br>
man was a bit the worse for wear, <br>
poured him a double of Southern Comfort. <br>
The man swilled down the drink and said, &quot;Gimme another!&quot; <br>
The bartender poured the drink, but said, <br>
&quot;Now, before I give you this, <br>
why don't you let off a little steam and <br>
tell me why you're so upset?&quot; <br>
So the man began his tale: &quot;Well, I was <br>
sitting in the bar next door when <br>
this gorgeous blond sauntered in, and <br>
actually sat beside me at the bar. <br>
I thought, Wow! This has never happened <br>
before. You know, it was kind of a <br>
fantasy come true. Well, a couple of <br>
minutes later I felt this hand moving around in my lap, and the blond leaned <br>
over, licked my ear, and asked if <br>
I was interested! I couldn't believe this was <br>
happening! I managed to nod my <br>
head, so she grabbed my hand, and started <br>
walking out of the bar. So of course I went with her. This was just too good to be true! She took me <br>
down the street here to a nice hotel and up to <br>
her room. As soon as she shut the <br>
door she slipped out of her dress. That was <br>
all she was wearing! I tell you <br>
it didn't take me much longer to get out of <br>
my clothes! But as soon as <br>
I jumped into the bed, I heard some keys <br>
jingling, and someone started <br>
fumbling with the door. The blond said, 'Oh <br>
my gosh, it's my boyfriend. <br>
He must have lost his wrestling match tonight. <br>
<br>
He's gonna be real mad! <br>
Quick, hide!' So I opened the closet, but I <br>
figured that was probably the <br>
first place he would look, so I didn't hide <br>
there. Then I looked under the bed, <br>
but no, I figured he was bound to look <br>
there too. By now I could hear <br>
the key in the lock. I noticed the window was <br>
open, so I climbed out and <br>
was hanging there by my fingers, praying that <br>
the guy wouldn't see me.&quot; <br>
<br>
The bartender said, &quot;Well I can see how <br>
you might be a bit frustrated at <br>
this point.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, yeah, but the guy finally got the <br>
door open and he yelled out, <br>
'Who you been sleeping with now, bitch?' The <br>
girl said, 'Nobody, honey, now come <br>
to bed and calm down.' Well, the guy <br>
started tearing up the room. I <br>
heard him tear the door off the closet and throw <br>
it across the room. I was <br>
thinking, Boy, I'm glad I didn't hide in <br>
there. Then I heard him lift up <br>
the bed and throw it across the room. Good <br>
thing I didn't hide under there <br>
either. Then I heard him say, 'What's that <br>
over there by the window?' <br>
I thought, Oh crap, I'm dead meat now. But <br>
the blond by now was trying real <br>
hard to distract him and convince him to <br>
stop looking. Well, I heard the <br>
guy go into the bathroom, and I heard water <br>
running for a long time, and I <br>
figured maybe he was gonna take a bath or <br>
something, when all of a sudden <br>
the bastard poured a pitcher of scalding <br>
hot water out of the window right <br>
on top of my head! I mean look at this, I <br>
got second- degree burns all over <br>
my scalp and shoulders!&quot; <br>
<br>
The bartender said, &quot;Oh man, that would <br>
have enraged me for sure.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No, that didn't really bother me. Next, <br>
the guy started slamming the <br>
window shut over and over on my hands. I <br>
mean, look at my fingers. They're <br>
a bloody mess, I can hardly hold onto this <br>
glass.&quot; <br>
<br>
The bartender looked at the guy's hands <br>
and said, &quot;Yeah, buddy, I can <br>
understand why you are so upset. <br>
&quot;No, that wasn't what really ticked me <br>
off.&quot; The bartender then asked in exasperation, <br>
&quot;Well, what did finally tick <br>
you off?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I was hanging there, and I turned <br>
around and looked down, and <br>
I was only about six inches off the ground!&quot; <br>

Of course, <br>
the <br>
wife promptly hacked her first shot right through the window of the <br>
biggest house adjacent to the course. <br>
<br>
The husband cringed, &quot;I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have to go <br>
up <br>
there, find the owner, apologise and see how much your lousy drive is <br>
going to cost us.&quot; <br>
<br>
So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm <br>
voice said, &quot;Come on in.&quot; <br>
<br>
When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done - glass was <br>
all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side <br>
near <br>
the broken window. <br>
<br>
A man reclining on the couch asked, &quot;Are you the people that broke my <br>
window?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Uh...yeah, sir. We're sure sorry about that,&quot; the husband replied. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you. You see, <br>
I'm <br>
a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now <br>
that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give <br>
you <br>
each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for <br>
myself.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Wow, that's great!&quot; the husband said. He pondered a moment and then <br>
blurted out, &quot;I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my <br>
life.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No problem,&quot; said the genie. &quot;You've got it, it's the least I can do. <br>
And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And now you, young lady, what do you want?&quot; the genie asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'd like to own a gorgeous home complete with servants in every <br>
country <br>
in the world,&quot; she said. <br>
<br>
&quot;Consider it done,&quot; the genie said. &quot;And your homes will always be safe <br>
from fire, burglary and natural disasters!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And now,&quot; the couple asked in unison, &quot;what's your wish, genie?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle and haven't been with a <br>
woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your <br>
wife.&quot; <br>
<br>
The husband looked at his wife and said, &quot;Gee, honey, you know we both <br>
now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?&quot; <br>
<br>
She mulled it over for a few moments and said, &quot;You know, you're right. <br>
Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about <br>
you, honey?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You know I love you sweetheart,&quot; said the husband. &quot;I'd do the same <br>
for <br>
you.&quot; <br>
<br>
So the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of <br>
the afternoon enjoying each other. The genie was insatiable. After <br>
about <br>
three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly <br>
into <br>
her eyes and asked, &quot;How old are you and your husband?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Why, we're both 35,&quot; she responded breathlessly. <br>
<br>
&quot;NO SHIT. Thirty-five years old and both of you still believe in <br>
genies?&quot; <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

He finds his way to a barstool and orders a drink. After sitting there for awhile, he yells to the bartender, &quot;Hey, you wanna hear a blonde joke?&quot; <br>
The bar immediately falls absolutely quiet. In a very deep, husky voice, the woman next to him says, &quot;Before you tell that joke, sir, I think it is just fair - giving that you are blind - that you should know five things: <br>
<br>
1 - The bartender is a blonde girl. <br>
<br>
2 - The bouncer is a blonde girl. <br>

3 - I'm a 6 feet tall, 220 lb. blonde woman with a black belt in <br>
     karate. <br>
<br>
4 - The woman sitting next to me is blonde and is a<br>
     professional weightlifter. <br>
<br>
5 - The lady to your right is a blonde and is a professional<br>
     wrestler. <br>
<br>
Now think about it seriously, Mister. Do you still wanna tell that joke? <br>
<br>
The blind man thinks for a second, shakes his head, and declares,&quot;Nah . . . Not if I'm gonna have to explain it five times.&quot; <br>

I am feeling pretty bad because it looks like I won't be able to<br>
plant my potato garden this year. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, all my troubles would be over. I know you would dig the plot for me. <br>

For heaven's sake, Dad, don't dig up that garden. That's where I buried the bodies.<br>

At 4:00 AM the next morning, FBI agents and local police showed up and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologized to the old man and left. That same day the old man received another letter from his son.<br>

Go ahead and plant the potatoes now. It's the best I could do under the circumstances.<br>

The woman agrees. So they go back to her place. She goes into the bathroom and starts scrubbing up like she's about to go into the operating room.<br>
<br>
She scrubs for a good 10-20 minutes.<br>
Finally, she goes into the bedroom and they have sex for an hour or so. Afterwards, the man says to the woman, &quot;You're a surgeon, aren't you?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, how did you know?&quot;<br>
&quot;I could tell by the way you scrubbed up before we started.&quot; <br>

&quot;Nonsense,&quot; the doctor said.  &quot;Even though you and your wife both have black hair, one of your ancestors may have contributed red hair to the gene pool.&quot;<br>

<br>
Her First Dirty Movie ......<br>
<br>
Judi, who happens to be blonde, decides to do<br>
something wild that she has never done before. <br>
Judi then sets out to rent her first X-rated adult<br>
video. <br>
She goes to the video store and, after looking around<br>
for a while, selects a title that sounds very<br>
stimulating. <br>
She drives home, lights some candles, slips into<br>
something comfortable, and puts the tape in the VCR. <br>
To her disappointment, there's nothing but static on<br>
the screen, so she calls the video store to complain. <br>
Judi: &quot;I just rented an adult movie from you and<br>
there's nothing on the tape but static.&quot; <br>
Store Clerk: &quot;Sorry about that. We've had problems <br>
with some of those tapes. Which title did you rent?&quot; <br>
Judi: &quot;It's called 'Head Cleaner'.&quot; <br>
