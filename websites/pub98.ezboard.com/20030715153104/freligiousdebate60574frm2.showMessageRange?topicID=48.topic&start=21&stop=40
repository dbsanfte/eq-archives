Richmond's largest homeless shelter is the Daily Planet. It has been searching for a permanent location for as long as I have lived here, roughly 8 years. <br>
<br>
If SBMB is so interested in helping people they don't have to go far. About 2 miles would do the trick. <br>
<br>
But I guess helping the homeless, mentally ill, and abused isn't as fufilling as going overseas to show people how good Christianity is.

American Muslims cutting back charitable giving <br>
By Rachel Zoll<br>
ASSOCIATED PRESS<br>
<br>
     Omer bin Abdullah won't be leaving a paper trail this year when he makes his traditional donation to the poor during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.  <br>
     He will fulfill his religious duty by handing cash directly to a needy family, as will many other American Muslims at a time when federal investigators are targeting U.S.-based Islamic charities in the hunt for terrorists.<br>
     &quot;People are so scared that they don't know what to do,&quot; said Mr. Abdullah, of Herndon.<br>
     Islam requires its followers to give 2.5 percent of their income and savings to the poor annually and many do so during Ramadan. But since the September 11 attacks, the federal government has frozen the assets of three major Muslim nonprofits on suspicion of links with terrorism: the Holy Land Foundation of Richardson, Texas, and Benevolence International Foundation and Global Relief Foundation, both in the Chicago area.<br>
     Other Muslim charities, which feel they've been unfairly tarred by association, have seen a significant drop in donations. That has only heightened the importance of their Ramadan collections this year.<br>
     &quot;Two-thirds of our funds come from this month,&quot; said Muhammad Rahman, head of the New York-based international relief arm of the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA). &quot;If we don't make it, that means next year will be a very tough time.&quot;<br>
     In Islam, the start of the holy month is based on a lunar calendar and requires visual sightings of the new crescent moon. This year, it is expected to fall around next Wednesday. It is the most important time of the year for Muslims, and also the period when Islamic charities launch their biggest fund-raising campaigns.<br>
     A group of Muslim leaders met with President Bush in September, urging him to take some action so American Muslims feel safer making donations — a practice referred to in Islam as zakat, which is one of the five pillars of the faith. U.S. Muslim leaders are lobbying for a federal auditing system for Islamic charities, so investigators and donors can feel confident that no money goes to groups thought to have terrorist ties.<br>
     Without such safeguards, many Muslims fear that sending checks to their favorite humanitarian organizations will inadvertently make them suspects in the eyes of law enforcement.<br>
     Ismat Hamid, an industrial pharmacist from Ann Arbor, Mich., said many Muslims in his community plan to change the way they donate this year, although he will not. He will send money to U.S.-based Muslim humanitarian groups that help children in his native Iraq.<br>
     &quot;American Muslims, they don't want to put themselves in a situation that is very hard to prove they are innocent,&quot; Mr. Hamid said. &quot;After September 11 in general, the American Muslims are guilty until proven innocent.&quot;<br>
     Mercy USA for Aid and Development, an international humanitarian organization founded by American Muslims, is attempting to address such concerns. The Michigan nonprofit posted a statement on its Web site noting it works with the U.S. Agriculture Department, and has enclosed similar statements in its direct-mail fund-raising campaigns.<br>
     The group collects as much as 30 percent of its private donations for the year during Ramadan. Umar al-Quadi, Mercy's chief executive, said giving is down owing to the slow economy and donor fear.<br>
     &quot;People generally are scared,&quot; Mr. al-Quadi said.<br>
     Mr. Rahman, whose organization is known as ICNA Relief-Helping Hand, said donations to his group have dropped by about one-third owing to concern about government investigations. He already has been forced to cut back his program to help poor people in the United States cover expenses for rent and food.<br>

<br>
Nah, it's just a dream that DBC keeps having that I will one day cross over!<br>
<br>
The organization itself, Samaritan's Purse, I don't really have a problem with...it's an evangelical organization (and I love the Graham family!)<br>
<br>
Now, regarding the work they are doing - I think there are three types of missionaries:<br>
1) Those who go to reach the unsaved.<br>
2) Those who go to help and reach the unsaved.<br>
3) Those who go to help.<br>
<br>
I think Samaritan's Purse falls in under #2 -  doesn't somebody need to go in and do relief work?  I don't think I have a problem with them going in and helping these people who are coming out of Iraq, and they are waiting for clearance before heading into Iraq...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>As tensions mounted in the Middle East, Samaritan’s Purse stockpiled emergency supplies and equipment in Amman, Jordan. From there, they can be trucked into Iraq in a matter of hours to bring critically needed relief to people in cities and villages that have been crippled by war.<br>
     Resources include a water system that can provide drinking water for up to 20,000 people, material to build temporary shelters for more than 4,000 families, packages of household items for 5,000 families, and medical kits designed to meet the general medical needs of 100,000 people for three months.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  (From their website)<br>
<br>
So it's not so much that they're just going to try to convert, but to actually help these people.  Would I do it?  Now?  Good Lord, NO!  I was scared silly when I did my mission trip - and that wasn't in the middle of major war, but rather a nice peaceful Central American country! (even though the local law enforcement was there on every street corner with a semi-automatic rifle)<br>
<br>
Evangelism is responsibility of every Christian whether it be on the homefront or in another country.

I can't tell you how sad it makes me to see someone write that.  Should I assume you share their beliefs/opinions?<br>
<br>
Here are some quotes from the Graham family:<br>
<br>
&quot;The problem I have with Islam is the silence from the clerics around the world,&quot; he said. &quot;These so-called Islamic groups that try to challenge my statements -- I don't care about these guys. Who are these guys? Where are the clerics? ... I would like to see an apology from the clerics. I would like for the chief clerics of Saudi Arabia to come to this country, go to Ground Zero, beg for forgiveness, and say to America, 'We are sorry.'&quot; (Franklin Graham)<br>
<br>
On Fox News cable network's &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; program, Graham, after repeatedly refusing to deny that Islam is &quot;evil,&quot; said: &quot;I think it's [terrorism] more mainstream. And it's not just a handful of extremists. If <br>
you buy the Koran, read it for yourself, and it's in there. The violence that it preaches is there.&quot;  Hannity responded by saying: &quot;But this then raises a question. If this is not, reverend, the extremist fanatical interpretation of the Quran, then we do have a big problem.&quot; Graham replied: &quot;Big problem.&quot;  Earlier in the day, Graham appeared on Hannity's nationally-syndicated radio program where he made similar remarks and claimed that Muslim leaders have failed to condemn terrorism, despite the fact that all major American Muslim groups condemned the 9/11 attacks and other acts of terrorism. When a Muslim caller tried to offer a balancing view, Hannity cut his microphone. When other callers openly stated that &quot;Islam is evil,&quot; neither Graham nor Hannity challenged those bigoted views.<br>
<br>
&quot;We’re not attacking Islam but Islam has attacked us. The God of Islam is not the same God. He’s not the Son of God of the Christian or Judeo-Christian faith. It’s a different God and I believe it is a very evil and wicked religion.&quot; (Franklin Graham)<br>
<br>
&quot;We were shocked to learn that a man of the cloth and stature of the Rev. Billy Graham held anti-Semitic views and freely shared them with President Richard Nixon, as revealed on the just released Nixon tapes. Rev. Graham's assertion that Jews had a &quot;stranglehold&quot; on the country and that a second Nixon Administration &quot;might be able to do something,&quot; is chilling and frightening, even today, 30 years after the statements were made.  It is shameful that one of America's most respected religious leaders and a spiritual advisor to Presidents believed and espoused age-old classical anti-Semitic canards.&quot; (Anti-Defamation League)<br>

The interviewer asked him point blank about the statements he made post 9/11 about Islam;  he denied nothing, and even reiterated his belief that it is an &quot;evil&quot; religion.  <br>
<br>
How sad and disturbing that, at a time when our nation should be turning its attention toward mending fences, toward fostering freedom and tolerance, anyone would seek to whisper this bunk into the ear of the listening world.<br>

Do I share Graham's beliefs..yes, we are both evangelical Christians...do I share his opinions, I imagine most of them...maybe not all...but can't I still love the Graham family without agreeing with every thing they may say or do?  I certainly love friends and family without agree 100% with what they do or say.<br>

Mr. Graham explained himself quite well in this quote...<br>

Franklin Graham is about much more than his views on Islam. He defends the right of American Christians to express their faith publicly. He promotes compassion for those infected with HIV/AIDS and encouraging churches to become involved in AIDS-focused hospice ministry. he has been bringing aid to people whose lives have been ripped apart by wars and natural disasters and has brought over 100 dying children from Bosnia to the US for heart surgery. Let him be known for that. <br>

&quot;I agree with the president that 'our war against terror is a war against individuals whose hearts are full of hate,'&quot; Franklin Graham said in a statement. &quot;This is not a war against Islam.&quot;<br>
<br>
Regarding the Rev. Billy Graham's comments from 30 years ago - why is it continuously brought up even though he has long since apologized for the comment?  At any rate -  <br>
<br>
&quot;They do not reflect my views and I sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks,&quot; he said. &quot;I cannot imagine what caused me to make those comments….I was wrong for not disagreeing with the President. My remarks did not reflect my love for the Jewish people. I humbly ask the Jewish community to reflect on my actions on behalf of Jews over the years that contradict my words in the Oval Office that day.&quot;<br>
<br>
His apology has been widely accepted (even by the ADL), so I see no need to discuss it further.  <br>
<br>
Again, I can love this family, and I don't have to completely agree with them.<br>

He has continued to vilify Islam after that date, so regardless of what he said there, he still has animosity towards the faith.  If he doesn't agree with it fine.. I don't agree with his faith.. but I don't think it's evil nor do I tell other people it is.<br>
<br>
And yes, you don't have to agree with what everyone thinks if you love them.  However, if someone I know makes bigoted statements, it certainly diminishes my love for them.  I can think of several Muslim leaders who on the one hand do good works, are charismatic speakers, and in general are inspiring, but on the other hand are tainted by having made anti-American statements, or by instigating people ideologically against the West.  Even if I thought they were good in an Islamic environment, I decry them because of their bigotry.  <br>
<br>
And more importantly, in the context of this discussion, how are people around the world supposed to view his actions when they read his statements -- should we be surprised that he is viewed with scepticism?<br>
<br>
Obviously I'm not trying to change your mind here, if you like them you like them, I just hope you can see how others, even the people they are &quot;trying to help&quot;, may perceive them.<br>

I was about to agree with this, but I have to confess it is more fear than sadness I feel these days when I see/hear Graham supporters. What makes me even more sick is the statement that he supports the right of xians to publicly profess their faith....LIKE THEY DON'T NOW EVERYWHERE, EVERYPLACE, EVERYWAY and would NEVER allow any other faith to do!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have a couple of questions for both you and Kate.<br>
<br>
Candy:  Do you think there is a difference in witnessing to people who are educated about Christianity but have chosen a different religion (i.e. Islam) versus witnessing to people who have never had an opportunity to hear about Christianity?  The problem I have with the idea of missionaries going to Iraq is that I feel (knowing what I know about Franklin Graham) that they are way more interested in converting Muslims than offering relief.  That is just my opinion, I know you probably disagree.  My point is, though, that Muslims know what the Bible says about Jesus, and they believe in him as a great prophet--they just do not accept the Christian doctrine that He is God or our savior.  So isn't witnessing to them like saying, &quot;I know you've studied this, but the religion you hold sacred is wrong--and unless you accept my beliefs you are going to hell?&quot;  That is how I would look at it anyway.  I'm just curious if you think that might be insulting to them, or if it would be insulting to you if the situation were reversed.<br>
<br>
Kate:  For the sake of argument, if missionaries were there primarily to provide relief, do you think they could share their religious beliefs in a way that would be appropriate?  I am sure you think it is wrong (as do I) for someone to say, &quot;Here is your food, but before you get it you have to listen to this sermon.&quot;  But what if they just said something like, &quot;The peace of Christ be with you&quot; or asked the person if there was anything they could help them with spiritually?  I'm just curious what you feel would be stepping over the line here--I don't know how I would feel if I were in that position.  BTW, I enjoy your posts on the War in Iraq board, you are doing a great job explaining yourself.  I can't stomach posting over there so I just lurk.  I am so sorry somebody posted that God-awful Ann Coulter site.  What an embarrassment.<br>

<br>
The trip I went on to Honduras, we went and worked with a Christian church that was already established there, so we knew that the people there already knew about Christianity - and it's not like it's a completely closed off country.  Our outreaches were actually concerts in the city square, prisons, local parks, universities, etc... those who came were given bibles and literature, and if they were interested, then we would talk with them more about Christ.  If not, then we walked away praying that we had at least planted some small seed in their mind that they might remember at some point in the future.<br>
<br>
I think that if I were going to go in with a relief aid group, my focus should be on helping these people.  Yes, the fact that I'm a Christian I think should be shared, but the aid given to be people should not be contingent on being able to share the Gospel with them.  <br>

Yeah, sometimes at that board I have to take a step back (&quot;step away from the computer&quot; lol), do something else for a little bit, then come back again to respond.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't really know how to answer your question.  I guess for me it would be to just give your help, and make it known who you are (by your name or dress or something), but I don't think it's appropriate to bring up spiritual issues at all unless you're asked.  I try to think how it would be if, for example, in the aftermath of September 11 Muslim groups travelled to the WTC to help people in the area, but at the same time spread the message of Islam.  I mean, I don't know how you would do that without really offending people.  We are pretty noticeable as Muslims just by the way we dress (which is the point), so I think if you just approached people like that and helped them, they would know you were Muslim and if they wanted to they could ask you about it.  <br>
<br>
The problem with faith-based charities (and this is also my problem with the whole faith-based initiative, btw) is that it's really difficult to separate the faith from the charity, and if it is a faith that has a strong sense of &quot;spreading the message&quot; I think it makes charitable works that much more difficult. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pagels@religiousdebate60574>Pagels</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/8/03 10:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: and yet another difference</span><hr size=1> There is a moving homeless shelter in town that uses chuch basements for a week at a time.

The interesting thing about these hypotheticals is that if you turned them around on xians the whole situation would become coercive, disrespectful and Satanic. I know you were not advocating missions, but these kinds of &quot;what's the harm&quot; questions are always asked when you know darn well they wouldn't stand for &quot;Allah be with you&quot; or &quot;May the Goddess bless you&quot; or &quot;May the Satanic Principles Guide you my brother...&quot; It's the same double standard we all know exists that makes the typical xian position so disingenuis and nauseating.<br>
<br>
Next time someone asks you one of these, consider turning it around:<br>
<br>

<br>
Why can't you xians sit with your mouths shut while we all recite this is one nation under Allah/Satan/no god?<br>

Allah is on our side.<br>
<br>
Missions-We're not harassing, we're just spreading the good word.<br>
We're not harassing, we're just spreading the Muslim word/word of the goddess/telling the truth about Satan.<br>

Censorship-Isn't it a crime how children in Iraq can't read the bible? <br>
Isn't it a crime how children in America can't read Harry Potter/The Satanic Bible/anything fundies find offensive?<br>

I didn't say these are &quot;what's the harm&quot; questions, I was just trying to understand if people considered any reference to religion inappropriate under these circumstances or if it was a matter of how it was presented.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps I am unique, but I am not threatened or offended by a person of another religion addressing me with a reference to their God or beliefs.  If they were doing it respectfully (as in your examples above) I would be respectful to them as well.  I don't have to agree with them to accept the comment in the spirit in which it was intended.  I am as big of an advocate of SOCAS as you are, so as long as the govt. is not inflicting religious views on me or anyone else I don't have a problem with people sharing their beliefs.<br>

If I were in Israel and in school, they observed some Jewish religous practice again, I would not be offended or put off to sit and observe.<br>
<br>
The only one of your examples that I would have a problem with is Satan, because if people believe in Satan, they also have to acknowlege the existence of God and are by that admission accepting the EVIL influence of Satan.  I do not want to stand by while someone invites the Enemy of God into the room.  Now if an Athesist believes in &quot;the Satanic bible&quot;, they have specifically chosen  a symbol which is in its nature offensive to Christians and others and by the nature of its title it is disrespectful or spiteful and that to me is not &quot;very cordial&quot;  <br>
<br>
But if a Druid were to recite a &quot;prayer&quot; to a tree of something of that nature,I would find it educational and would be happy to sit politely and observe.<br>
<br>
Non Christians just dont get why we do missionary work.  It is out of love and concern for the spiritual well being of all of our brothers and sisters.  We also believe we will be held accountable if we fail to share.  Now if a person says no thanks, Im not interested fine, you have opened the door and they chose not to walk through.  You dont need to beat a dead horse and KEEP witnessing.  <br>
<br>
But imagine to your surprise  that you get to the other side and find out that life does continue and one of your friends had the key to eternal happines, but was unwilling to share it with you.  You are not going to be very happy with that friend who could have made your eternity a much happier place to be.  I imagine you would go to that person and ask, why didnt you share with me? didnt you care about me?  You had this precious gift and you kept it all to yourself.  How could you?  We have been given beautiful gift and unless we give others at least the opportuntiy to choose to hear or not hear, they and God will hold us responsible some day.<br>
<br>
Faith in Christ does not leave room for &quot;all roads lead to the same place.&quot;  Yes others may have a religion, but there is but one truth and if I know I have it,I cant accept others beliefs as true.  I can accept their right to believe as they choose, but it does not mean that I have to accept that what they believe is going to save them.  So as a person who wants everyone to be &quot;saved&quot;, I am obligated to at least offer them what I feel to be the truth.  If not I am not sincere in my faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Redeemer.
