<br>
So, as I'll be making new areas, I'm wondering about giving some of the other areas of my site an overhaul, if I get time. In particular the main index page, which is here <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.silvas-world.co.uk/">www.silvas-world.co.uk/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  so any views on how my index page looks and is it easy to find way around etc please.<br>
<br>
The ultima section I'll leave much as it is, but if people have time to look at some of the other areas, and give opinions please.  I'm wondering if the section about me and my site should be two separate sections? And what about site news? <br>
<br>
Also does anyone have any suggestions how I could get more visitors in to my site? Some areas are doing really well, others aren't. What kind of thing encourages visitors to come to site, and hope fully keep returning?<br>
<br>
The new content I want to add over coming motnhs is an improved section on dogs, and a diary of caring for a puppy when I get one, a section on my wildlife garden, with photos by me, improved photos section with section for wildlife photos including info on wild plants and butterflys etc, other photo sections with photos of where I live etc. These are all things that interest me, which is why I want to do them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Would it be better to have a separate site for these new areas?<br>
<br>
Does having things like online journals or forums increase the number of visitors? If I did a forum it'd be about things like dogs, border terriers, photography, wildlife and wildlife gardening.<br>
<br>
Also, just in case the pipex space turns out to be crap or something, anyone know of cheap web space providers?<br>
<br>
Also why do people have banners? Do I need them? Do they help in advertising my site? And if I do need them how would I make them? Or, would anyone here be prepared to help me by making me some banners or backgrounds? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

HUGE area.  This could easily evolve into an FAQ, so bear with me.<br>
<br>
Comments on the site - I've tried not to say whether I like things or not, as I can see you're after constructive comments and not just a pat on the back. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
- &quot;Access is denied&quot; error messages on a lot of the home pages - This might be due to the redirect you're using.  You need to get rid of those messages.<br>
- Consistency - It might be an idea to use the same design throughout the site.  Fonts and colours tend to vary as you move to a different area.  If people find your site on a search engine, they may not start at the home page of your site, and it's quite hard to see that it's all part of the same site.<br>
- Dividing up the site - How would you divide it up, beyond the way you currently have it separated out into subject areas?  That could become quite confusing.<br>
- New areas - things like photos of your wildlife garden could tie in with the photography pages.  Try to keep related content together - it improves the site structure.<br>
- Banners - To be honest they are no longer worth doing.  Nobody really clicks them because they never tell you very much about the site.  I wouldn't bother with them.<br>
- Images - I could try and do a funky background for you if you like.  I'm sure there are a few others here who could do the same.  We could also do you a logo.  That way, if you put it on every page, people will know they're at your site.<br>
- Web space - hmm, you get what you pay for.  Cheap usually means a total lack of customer service if things go wrong.  uk2.net is very cheap - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://uk2.net">uk2.net</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> - but I moved FROM them because they didn't have any customer support at all.  I moved to Web Site Source - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.websitesource.com">www.websitesource.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> - very good, but you'll pay $19.99 per month (about £15) and you probably wouldn't need a lot of what they give you.  Someone else can help with this! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/lol.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
- Forums - yes they can help.  In fact they can help a lot.  But you've got to be prepared for the quiet times - forums always start off really slowly, unless you have a huge volume of people who visit your web site already.  A lot of forum hosts require that you set up the software on your own server and I would not recommend that you do that - there is no point unless you really know what you're doing.  (No offence meant - I wouldn't know either!)  So I'd recommend ezboard - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.ezboard.com">www.ezboard.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> - there are people here who can help you set it up and get it looking as you want it to.  You don't have to pay, but the popup ads are so bad on the free version of ezboard that I'd strongly recommend going for their introductory offer - $9.95 for 3 months I think?<br>
- Online Journals - I don't think having a journal will make much of a difference to your traffic.  That's very much something that you've got to do for yourself.  If lots of people come and look at it then that's great, but you'll probably have more luck with forums.<br>
- Your home page - You could give people an overview of what's in each area, and what the site's about.<br>
- Poetry pages - I prefer to do a page for each poem, as bookmarks can be quite confusing to navigate.<br>
<br>
Well you did ask <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  is any of that helpful? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Do you wish to debug? Line: 2. Access Denied.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apart from that small oversight I really really really like your website. Why?<br>
<br>
Well for a start it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It's plain and simply a personal homepage, with (unlike most personal pages) some real interesting content to be browsed over. Many personal sites try to look too professional, and lose that cosy feeling, that little bit of eccentricy, and the apparent feeling that some hard personal work has gone into it. <br>
<br>
Yes of course you could colour scheme the entire site, or make a nice easy to navigate menu - but frankly , I like it the way it is. Okay - if im picky, a slightly smaller font - cuzz I have to scroll far too much :P.<br>
<br>
Okay - so thats not what your looking for? Well tough. :P I like it.. and I wish more people had such interesting personal webpages, that really did give a nice insight into the minds of their creators.<br>
<br>

p.s. On the subject....Mandalay is almost complete. :P <p><CENTER><HR>

<br>
It's odd that you both complain of these access denied errors, cos when I look at my site I don't get them at all, I do get a couple of page not found errors though. Does anyone else get access denied errors?<br>
<br>
I think these are to do with the problems caused by the redirection serrvice my mate took out in my name, if I'd known it would cause these probs I would have said no to his offer. So, if the site is moved then that should solve those problems I hope. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If not, I'll be posting on here asking for help again.<br>
<br>

I will think about that, but I felt that as each section is unrelated so the diferent backgrounds help to differentiate between them, also I had tons of fun choosing them. What do other people think? <br>
Hmm considering doing this, maybe. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> - Dividing up the site - How would you divide it up, beyond the way you currently have it separated out into subject areas? That could become quite confusing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Well the section on the ultima games isnt really related to the other sections which are maybe more creative. Uhm. I'm confused even thinking about it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Yes you are probably right, two silvas worlds would be silly and annoy people too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> New areas - things like photos of your wildlife garden could tie in with the photography pages. Try to keep related content together - it improves the site structure. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Hmmm yes maybe so, but I had wanted to do a section on wildlife and on wildlife gardening, so it would be more than just photos, it would tell people about how to grow the plants and stuff. I do kind of see your point, but I'm not sure how to tie all the sections of my site that would use photos together. <br>
<br>
Any suggestions please? Should I have links from photos section to other areas where people can see my photos? Should I use same design for all areas featuring my photos?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Images - I could try and do a funky background for you if you like. I'm sure there are a few others here who could do the same.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Your home page - You could give people an overview of what's in each area, and what the site's about. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yes I'd like to do this, but I'm not sure how to implement it within the present design.<br>
<br>
One thing I'd like to do is those menues where if you move your curser over an item on the menu, it brings up a little box that gives bit more detail of what that menu link is for. What would I need to know to do this?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> - Poetry pages - I prefer to do a page for each poem, as bookmarks can be quite confusing to navigate.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Reason I did it that way is cos of personal preference, before I got adsl I always found it a bit irritating to be constantly having to load new web pages just to get only a little bit of information, sometimes they would load very slow for me. So on my site I tried to make a site that I'd find easy to navigate, just comes down to different people liking different things I guess. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.bbarden.com/img/em/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
However considering this again, might change it, what do others think?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Well you did ask  is any of that helpful?  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yes it is, all input on my site is always helpfull and appreciated, and such detailed advice is very helpfull indeed.

(oh the wonders of an oxford english dictionary)<br>

2) ben, you would be wrong. uk2 provide tech support on a free phone number for those customers who require it. simple send them an email and ask for it, they reply asking you why you need to phone them, and if its a good enough reason they will give it to you. normally, you would need to spend over £1 million a month on their services before you require this, but yet, they do clearly provide the best tech support ever, and a website full of useless FAQ's..<br>
<br>
3) should i have read the rest of the posts? the redirection on your site seems fine silva, when i have more time tomorrow i will cheap it out. try making some type of layout like ben has, a universal design, so each page has a good bit in common, but not identical of course. get someone to make some pictures if your not into doing it yourself? <p>::
