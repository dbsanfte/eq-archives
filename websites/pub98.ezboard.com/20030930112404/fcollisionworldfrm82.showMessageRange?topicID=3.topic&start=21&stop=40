Still staring at the stronger suit, he moved his arm, taking out the last of the smaller ones.  &quot;Hah!&quot; he said, drawing his beam sword.  A beam whizzed right past his head.  &quot;Huh?&quot; he said, peering to his right.  Two suits dropped down from the sky.  &quot;Damn you!&quot; Hoffman yelled, enraged.  &quot;The whole 83rd...gone!&quot; he said.  &quot;You'll pay!&quot; he said, firing his beam cannon.&quot;  Seric let it pierce through his leg. &quot;Puh.&quot; he said, looking to the other one.  &quot;What?!?&quot; Seric yelled, backing up.  &quot;Hmmm....&quot; he said.  &quot;This could actually be fun, but, I have a schedule to keep.&quot; he said, firing two flares into the air.  &quot;Have fun holding off the rest of the invasion.  Hahahahah!!&quot; he said, flying up.  'That ACE...there's something strange about him...' he thought while flying out of there.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was easy.&quot; Hoffman said, noticing the damaged suit nearby. &quot;Hey, are you alright?!&quot; Mike asked the other pilot. <p>------<br>

<br>
&quot;Alright sir, I got our flank.&quot; Hoffman said, since he could only use short bursts of jets, because his legs were pretty banged up.  <br>
&quot;ACE#2, come in #2.&quot; the intercom read.<br>
&quot;Central, this is #2, take it away.&quot; he said, still walking.<br>
&quot;All the defense towers are down. We are currently evacuating all of the civilians out of the area.  We have detected several bombers from the mainland coming in soon, be sure to get to the Central Post in a matter of hours, over.&quot;<br>
&quot;Copy that Central.&quot; Mike said, assuming Mike and the other pilot had heard the message.  &quot;Damn, I bet they'll be coming in by sea too.&quot; Hoffman said, using a short burst to catch up.<br>

An ACE.  &quot;Dammit!&quot; He said.  &quot;Hoffman, are you alright?&quot; he asked franticly.  &quot;Yeah...I'm alright.  I sure as hell can't move though!&quot; he said, opening the cockpit hatch.  &quot;Get the hell out of that suit now!&quot; Mike said, jumping over Hoffman's fallen suit.  He fired the machine gun, but easily avoided by the ACE.  &quot;Damn it!&quot; He said.  &quot;Hoffman, You need to get the Central.  Its only a couple hundred meters.  You got your M4?&quot; he asked, firing another volley.  &quot;Yeah, I'll be alright, you just get back!&quot; he said, jumping out. &quot;Good luck boss!&quot; he said, dashing down the street.  &quot;I thought I told him to...&quot; he said, as the ACE jumped forward, slashing with his sword.  &quot;Heh, you'll have to try harder!&quot;<br>
<br>
The ACE jumped up, ontop of a skyscraper, and motioned with his free hand to get up there.  &quot;You just wait.&quot; he said, backjumping onto a nearby scraper as well.  They stood there for a second.  Then, missles blew out of the ACE's suits leg launcher, followed by another batch.  &quot;Homing!&quot; he said, staring at the screen which said 'lock-on'.  &quot;Ahhh @#%$!&quot; he said, back jumping again, firing like crazy.  He took out most of them, but was hit by a few.  &quot;Well, that was careless of me.&quot; he said smiling.  &quot;Time to die!&quot; he said, switching the machine gun to a small cannon rifle.  He fired a shot, jumping forward, he quickly drew his beam sword and slashed down.  Amazingly, the ACE had been hit, but was able to block the attack.  &quot;Your smarter than you look.&quot; Mike continued, falling to the ground, hovering, and then landed.  The ACE jumped down, headfirst with his jets on.  &quot;Idiot.&quot; Mike said, backpedaling a little, firing a shot.  It hit, but it didn't effect it at all.  &quot;Puh.&quot; Mike said, drawing his beam sword once more.  The ACE did the same once it landed.  The walked to each other, and then galloped at the last second, hitting the swords at full force.  The ACE backjumped, but Mike charged forward, hitting the enemy with his side.  &quot;I'm NOT ditching another weapon.&quot; he said, keeping his machine gun holstered on the suit's back.  The ACE got back up, and jumped foward.  &quot;Oh, so now your furious.  Good, that makes you an easy target, you'll be blinded by your madness!&quot; he said, easily sidestepping, slashing downward with his sword, cutting the ACE right in half.  &quot;They're easy today...must be rookies.&quot; he said, walking off in the explosion. <p>------<br>

In front of him, the tall tower of Central Command was raised, and gunfire was everywhere, close, and in the distance.  Suddenly, a speeding volley of bullets went past his head, and he jumped to the left, in back of an overturned car.  He got up, in a crouching position.  He slowly stood up to look over the car.  There were about a half a dozen troops.  &quot;Aw @#%$.&quot; he mumbled to himself.  They were advancing to his position, spread out on the double highway, about half on each side.  He ducked down again.  &quot;Hmm...Grenades!&quot; he thought, pulling one off of his belt of his pilot suit.  He pulled the pin, and threw it over his head with the opposite arm.  He ducked beneath the car.  Explosion, that shoved the car forward a couple inches, but nothing big.  He looked over, about 3 troops lie dead and 3 more running to the car.  He jumped out, running to his left, firing his M4 machine gun.  Nailed one in the chest, and another in the head.  One left.  He jumped behind a building, and looked over.  Gone.  &quot;What the...&quot; he said, and stepped out.  Gunfire, pain in left foot.  &quot;Dammit!&quot; he said, falling to his feet.   He saw the soldier, and opened fire.  Two the chest and one to the head. (OOC: heh, always wanted to say that.)  &quot;Gah..&quot; he said, standing up slowly.  Central Command was only about 350 meters, and he could make it, if there wasn't any enemies.<br>
<br>
About an hour or two later, (cause his leg was shot), he stomped into Central Command.  There were body bags everwhere, and medic tents were set up.  He looked around, and sat up against the wall.  He took off his helmet, sighing, and wiping the sweat off his head.  He was safe, for now.  <p>------<br>

Then he spotted Hoffman and a female, in a pilots suit.  &quot;That must be..&quot; he said, walking over to them.  &quot;Hey...Boss...&quot; Hoffman said, still sweaty and catching his breath.  &quot;I thought I told you to...&quot;Mike started, &quot;...never call you boss, yeah I know..&quot; Hoffman said, sounding a little better.  &quot;Geez, you musta just got here.&quot; Mike said.  &quot;Yeah, basicly.
