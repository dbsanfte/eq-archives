<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Well, frankly it's a long story. The only living members of my family are my mother and younger sister, but they're back home where I'm from. A little place called Pisa, Italy. My father died of cancer years ago, long before I learned how to heal. My friend, Venecia and I were inseperable. Then I found out she was a traitor. You see, we were part of this group and once you joined you were in the group for life, you couldn't leave. Then when her family was killed she got up and left Italy. She knew about the rule, but I guess when she joined she never thought her family was in any danger. So now I have no choice, but to find her and get her. Fortunately, she can get out of being hung for treason, if she wishes. But that's a secret that not even I'm supposed to know.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Dustin answered. Then he added jokingly, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;So no prying into my mind to find out.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">&quot;Did you say Dangerous?

He was the only friend I had when I found out I had psychic powers.  He stuck with me all the way until I told him that I was going away to practice using my powers...so I've lost touch with him for quite a while now...&quot; Elyen smiled and giggled, &quot;don't worry, I never go into people's minds without permission.

Marina walked by the alley and saw two people sitting there,  talking. She was about to continue walking when she thought that she knew one of them. She stood there and remembered that it was one of Kaden's friends. She saw his picture somewhere in Kaden's apartment. Marina went up to and said &quot; Hello! My name is Marina and you must be Elyen.Kaden told me about you. I'm his girlfriend and you must be Elyen's friend.&quot; Marina said to Dustin without letting anyone of them speak.&quot; Ok you two are coming with me.I bet Kaden gonna be mighty happy to see you. Your friend may come along too if he likes.&quot; Marina said and started to walk towards Kaden's apartment.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Yea I thought so.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he said in reply. Dustin started to tell him that he had owned a cat once too, but just then someone came up the alley and started talking to Elyen.

 Alex walked down an alley away from Shady's diner, his belly full of overly greasy food. He was feeling sick and tired at  the moment and swayed a bit as he walked. As he went farther down the alley  he thought he heard people talking then after a moment saw said people talking. He wouldn't have stopped save the fact that his stomach had launched a full scale rebellion on him.<br>
 He ran over to a trash for a few minutes as the greasy food was expelled from him. After he was feeling slightly better and his stomach felt less full he walked towards the people.<br>
<br>
As Alex passed by Elyen he felt something and stopped. He looked straight at him for a moment trying to figure it out. But then he knew, this guy was a psychic just like Alex. He grinned at Elyen. &quot;Hello there.&quot;<br>
