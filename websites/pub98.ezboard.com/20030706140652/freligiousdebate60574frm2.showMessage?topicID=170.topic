where you teach cross-curriculum in eras; presently we're on the ancients, up to 600 AD.<br>
<br>
Anyway, part of that is to read classical literature, and included in that at this stage are various mythologies, Bible stories, etc.  I guess in doing this I'm feeling kind of like an orientalist -- &quot;Here's what these other people believe(d), how strange!&quot; lol.  I just don't want my kids to get this superior attitude, but at the same time I don't want them to pick up some of the (what I consider to be) twisted values.. like how women are the cause of all our problems on earth (Eve, Pandora).<br>
<br>
All these myths I believe have been very formative, you can see their long-term influences on our societies, but how do you separate the grain from the chaff..  So I guess my question is how do you teach &quot;about&quot; religion (or religions not your own) without giving your kids a big superior attitude?<br>

I got a great dose of it myself in gifted classes in junior high and never remember feeling superior because of it. I suppose if you present it as just a belief system without degrading it, children would have to reason to consider it too weird. I see nothing wrong with discussing varying beliefs however and how they were affected by the times (of course this would happed with older kids, like 9-12 years old) on such topics as infaticide, women's roles, spirits controlling natural forces, human sacrifice etc. <br>
<br>
Many of us find these hideous practices, but when put in historical/cultural context can be more readily understood, preventing ethnocentricity or superiority complexes. That said, it's easier for me to teach these from the secular humanist position since I don't believe in Satan or that any of these belief systems are &quot;evil&quot;.  With small children, I would keep it very basic anyway and just explain how beliefs grew from and spawned new social movements, environmental conditions, political situations etc. <br>
<br>
P.S. The Great Books pull this off rather nicely too. I think presenting material and responding to questions without expressing personal judgement goes a long way too. Surely your children know your own beliefs and will look at school lessons, as they do all things, through the prism of their belief system. <br>

It is apparent just from straight-forward examination.  So really any 'big superiority complex' would stem from how they are taught about THEIR beliefs rather than the beliefs of others.  Sensitivity and tolerance of others belief without undermining their own.  You see intolerance all the time when someone walks in and preaches to you no matter what their system is or how ludicrus.  <br>
<br>
The last thing I would also like to add is the importance of not confusing a willingness to defend their science in argument or confrontation successfully using reason and logic with 'big superiority' on their part when it is only the superiority of the system.  Not that it will surprise anyone, but I have more than once been accused of superiority complex based on my comfort of conviction in science's merits.  This very seldom has anything to do with my actions, more frequently it has to do with reasoned responces to preachey types who come up to me to spread their word.  (I don't actually seek people out to challenge, I just don't flee when a fundie challenges me.)<br>
<br>
That said, good luck and my applause for taking the time and care to school your child as you are. <p>DBC67<br>

I actually found some copies of the Junior Great Books series, but unfortunately the volumes I found are later literature, and not the early stuff.. anyone have some good recommendations for early works in a format appropriate for lower grade school?  I found some really terrific versions of the Illiad, Odyssey, Aeneid, Greek Myths and Roman Myths, but I haven't found other cultures as well represented.. I'm sure that they're out there, I just haven't found them yet.. and since we're supposed to be reading these for an entire year, I need to get some more variety!<br>
<br>
And DBC I appreciated your comments as well, &quot;it's not that I feel superior, I'm just right.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Was that kind of the gist?

It all seems hopelessly complex, sometimes, this whole &quot;political correctness&quot; business.. I know it's important, but tiring nonetheless.  I know many of you must have faced some of these things before, but we don't do the whole Santa/Tooth Fairy/Easter bunny stuff, but since much (all?) of my family does, and it is dominant in this culture, I feel like I need to impress upon my kids how to handle this with finesse.. trying to avoid the &quot;You're all going to Hell for not believing what I believe&quot; as well as &quot;I don't believe in any of that crap.&quot; lines. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 315<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/1/03 9:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=170.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re:diverse kid's literature</span><hr size=1> &quot;but I haven't found other cultures as well represented..

Let me get you some titles. I am working with an inner city school as the liaison for my factory and they provided us a very diverse book wish list for the book drive we are having...everything from foreign language kids books to Muslim/Jewish/Asian/S. American as this particular school has 14 separate ethnicities and languages!!! I didn't know they had a Junior Great Books--that rocks!! I was a HS teacher too, so can ask some of my former elem. teacher buddies as all the stuff we did was higher reading level.<br>

One of the reasons that I'm big on teaching Dylan about our culture is if he says &quot;those people are backwards&quot; I can respond with &quot;that is what some people say about us&quot;.  I think that being part of the minority helps to give us a boost in the department of teaching tolerance to our children.  Since Dylan is only 2, I can't offer up any successful experiences just yet, but I plan to teach him &quot;this is what some people believe&quot;, and I hope that works.  I will try to preface it as a mere expression of other people's thoughts, and not put it into the context that it is wrong.  I don't plan on homeschooling, but raising a Jewish child in an agnostic household that has parents who were raised Jewish and Christian might be just a little challenging.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm also trying to buy him books that educte him about different languages and cultures, but they don't necessarily address the religious aspect.  I think it is a challenge for most parents to raise their kids acknowledging that people are different instead of just plain wrong.  So, I don't have any great advice for you, but I do empathize.  It sounds like you are doing a great job with the homeschooling.  Some of the books you are talking about getting are books I didn't even hear of until college, either that or I didn't pay attention.  You'll be raising some smart kids.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My parents are both converts and in my moms family she is the only LDS.  My aunt was Lutheran, my other aunt and my grandmas (grandma and great grandma) were agnostic.  (no men on that side - EVERYBODY was divorced at least once, except my mom <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
So in our house my parents told us why they chose to be LDS and that they believed in it and of course they took us to church as a family, but when we were teens, it was left up to us.  My sister and my brother both took a turn at testing the waters.  Me, I had enough friends of other faiths and had studied enough of my own that I consciously chose to believe in the LDS church.  <br>
<br>
Having family members, friends and neighbors who were loved and respected even if they had different beliefs opened me up to studying other faiths. When I was a missionary in Central America, I met alot of people from different faiths and had the chance to discuss religion with a variety of people.  <br>
