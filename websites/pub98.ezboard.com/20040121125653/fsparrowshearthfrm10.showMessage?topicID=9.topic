I wrote this. I'm taking a creative writing class this semester and I wrote this story.  I'm posting it because I'd love to hear feedback from you guys of what you thought, so I would be so honored if any of you would take the time to read it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I haven't received my grade back on it yet so I don't know what the professor thought.  But it is fiction, however it is based on a true story.  I remember a guy sharing a testimony in my church once and I took his testimony and created this story.  It's fiction because I added lots of details he didn't share, making this a fictional story based on something true, but it's not an autobiography, it is purely fiction. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

*************************<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It's just not working out,&quot; Shane overheard half of a phone conversation as he leaned against the wooden door frame.  He knew the middle-aged lady didn't intend for him to overhear the conversation.  As far as she was concerned, he was still sitting on the kitchen counter, holding the ice pack to his bruised face.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He really couldn't explain why he punched the boy at school, Ray had never said anything to him or provoked him in any way.  Something just seemed to snap in Shane when he saw Ray tormenting a smaller kid in the hallway.  Shane knew what it was like to get picked on by a bigger kid and felt the need to defend other kids in similar situations.  It helped give Shane some purpose and meaning to his life.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shane wasn't small for his age, but he wasn't big either.  He was of average height, weight and build.  Nothing about him made him stand out from his 6th grade classmates.  His medium brown hair had a natural wave to it and his blue eyes sparkled most of the time.  His grades which had been above average before his parents death now struggled to make it in the C range.  Shane had a hard time concentrating on schoolwork.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shane's heart sank as he realized another foster family had given up on him.  He had really hoped this time would work out.  But one little fight at school and his foster mother was on the phone with the social worker in charge of Shane's case.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Slowly he walked back to the kitchen and hopped up on the counter.  He ruffled his messy hair through his dirty fingers before rubbing them along the tear in his favorite shirt.  The Dallas Cowboy's t- shirt was far too big for him, but it was his favorite.  It had been his dad's.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Next year I'll teach you how to throw a ball,&quot; the words of his father still haunted him years later.  He drew a deep breath and faded out of the memory and back to the blue and white tiled kitchen he sat in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shane could hear the phone hang up in the other room and he quickly grabbed the ice pack and put it on his face as the lady returned.  She was silent.  Even worse, she wouldn't look at him but silently started putting dishes in the dishwasher as if nothing had happened.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Go to your room,&quot; she finally said and Shane left without resistance.  He knew the routine and was immediately packing his things, crying about it wouldn't change her decision and he didn't want to stay in a place he had to beg to live in.  An hour later the doorbell rang.  As he walked down the stairs he was greeted by the familiar face of his social worker who drove him back to the orphanage.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That night seemed darker than most.  The eerie dark night seemed to permeate into his bedroom and wrap itself around his soul causing him to shiver beneath his covers.  It was normal for him to muffle sobs as he fell asleep in this place, but that night was different.  A new sense of hopelessness and despair overtook him and he wept bitterly.  He was sure anybody awake could hear him, but in that place, nobody cared.  That realization only made the heartache worse.  Sleep for him would never come that night.  It was the longest night of his life as well as the coldest.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Living at the orphanage soon became the norm again and his tears at night were quieted down once again to muffled sobs.  Memories from the days of seeing kids at school hug a parent as they walked out to the curb where their mom or dad was waiting by the car were painful to him.  He would frequently become annoyed from hearing classmates gripe about how annoying their parents were, of how they showed them too much affection in public. Silently Shane wished he could trade places with any them.  If only his parents could come back to life, he would wrap his arms around them and never let go.  And he didn't care if the whole world watched.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The warm sun shone brightly on that fateful Tuesday in March.  As he stepped off the big yellow bus and approached the orphanage, he spotted his social worker's car.  His shoulders slumped as he let his head hang down as he walked on.  He had come to dread seeing her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Inside, the social worker sat quietly on the sofa, sipping the tea she'd been given.  It was more bitter than she preferred, but had not been offered any sugar or creamer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The front door creaked open, slowly.  She looked up to see a slumped figure walk in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Go pack your things,&quot; she smiled kindly at him as he walked in the house.  &quot;We have a new foster family for you.&quot;  Shane simply shrugged and went to his room without saying a word.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kate worried about him.  She'd been assigned to him right after his parents were killed in the burglary.  It was still unknown if Shane had seen or heard anything.  Initially he refused to talk about it, but after the police kept putting pressure on him, he told them he'd slept through the whole ordeal.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She knew he was a good kid at heart but lacked guidance.  Kate had searched long and hard for the family she was sending to.  Every time a family had sent him back, she felt as though she'd failed Shane.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This family seemed different, however, and she had interviewed them more intensely than any other family.  This family already had three children, but something said in their church had prompted them to try and help children less fortunate than their own.  She explained to them that Shane had a history of troubles, but that only seemed to make them more interested in bringing them into their home.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We didn't choose to foster a child because we thought it would be easy,&quot; Roger Perry had told her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kate's thoughts drifted back as Shane walked back in the room carrying his small bag, a sad reminder of his unstable lifestyle.  She smiled kindly and patted his back as she guided him to his door.  Shane walked to her car with a heavy weight on his soul.  He was tired of foster families, they were all the same and all he could think about was how long this one would last.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The drive was much further than any he had experienced before.  It was a good two hours away and much to his surprise, it was a farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, get out,&quot; Kate instructed him after noticing he wasn't moving,.  He stared blankly at the house, not sure what to think.  He'd never lived outside the city before.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He grabbed his backpack and slowly stepped out of the car and followed her to the front door.  No door bell, Kate had to knock.  Finally a woman in her mid 40's answered the door with a smile.  They were invited inside and Shane went through the familiar ritual of being introduced to his new foster parents as the woman's husband joined them from another room.  Shane was surprised, however, when he was introduced to Roger and Debbie's children.  He'd never been in a foster home before where the parents had biological children of their own.  They had two teenaged sons in high school as well as a daughter two years older than him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After the social worker left, Shane was led to the room that would be his bedroom.  A poster for the Dallas Cowboys hung on the wall over his bed and the comforter and pillow on the bed advertised the team as well.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We heard you liked the Dallas Cowboys,&quot; Debbie smiled as Shane's eyes scanned the room.  There was a Dallas Cowboys bean bag chair in the corner with a brand new football resting on it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Do you play football?&quot; Tom, Roger and Debbie's oldest son, asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No,&quot; Shane shook his head as he prevented the memory of his father's promise from resurfacing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Want to learn?&quot;  Shane looked up at his foster brother.  He was slender and well built, an obvious athlete.  Shane nodded his head and Tom smiled.  &quot;Well then, get unpacked and we can throw that new football of yours around.&quot; The family left to give Shane time to unpack. He didn't unpack though, knowing this family wouldn't last; none of the others had.  Instead he grabbed the football and headed outside.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A month had passed and Shane found himself starting to hope again.  Roger and Debbie actually seemed to care about him rather than just tolerate him.  And they didn't seem to show any favoritism between him and their own children.  Tom and Pete seemed to love having a little brother, teaching him to play sports such as football and basketball and showing him how to do the chores their parents required of them on the farm.  Shane actually enjoyed the animals and was thrilled the day Roger decided to teach him how to ride a horse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Debbie had silently noticed Shane's complexion changing.  When he first arrived at their home, he looked pale, almost sickly.  But now his cheeks were rosy and his skin overall had more color.  She wondered what exactly was causing that difference, pondering what the orphanage must have been like.  But Shane didn't seem to want to talk about his past and she and her husband were careful not to push him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shane's dreams were shattered in an instant, however.  A boy at school had found out that Shane was an orphan and had begun to torment him relentlessly.  Shane was determined not to let anything happen to send him back to the orphanage and strived to ignore Troy.  But as Shane washed his hands in the boys bathroom, Troy walked in and immediately began hurling insults at Shane.  Shane chose to ignore him, but doing so only made Troy angrier.  He grabbed Shane and began pulling him towards a stall.  Shane had enough and fought back.  Someone must have seen them because minutes later a male teacher was pulling them apart.  Parents were called and his foster mother showed up at the school, listened to the principal and took Shane home.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shane ran up to his room before she could see the tears.  He also didn't want to hear the phone call he knew she'd be making.  He already knew what was next.  He tried to stop the tears as he began to pack his things, but they came anyway.  Minutes later he heard a knock at the door, but couldn't bring himself to answer.  Finally the door opened and he could see his foster parents step in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Where are you going?&quot; Debbie asked as she sat on the end of his bed where he packed.  Shane wiped his tears with the back of his hand.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'm not going back to the orphanage,&quot; he finally said defiantly.  &quot;I'll run away first.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Who said you were going back to the orphanage?&quot; Roger asked as he leaned against the doorframe.  Shane looked at him silently for a moment, not sure how to answer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I was in a fight today,&quot; he spoke at last.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Roger replied.  &quot;You want to talk about it?&quot;  Shane looked at him, then at Debbie, confused.  He'd never had foster parents ask him to explain his actions before.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;What's it matter?  I messed up and now you're sending me back!&quot; his frustration increasing into anger.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We're not sending you back, sweetheart,&quot; Debbie replied calmly.  &quot;You made a mistake, but so does every child.  Our own children make them all the time.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You are welcome here for as long as you want,&quot; Roger told him.  &quot;We're not going to give up on you.  Please don't give up on us.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shane stood there speechless, his anger disarmed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So you're not sending me back?&quot; his voice quivered.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No,&quot; Debbie answered standing up and walking around the bed to him.  She put her hands on his arms and looked him in the eyes.  &quot;We love you.  And love never gives up.&quot;  Shane felt tears sting his eyes again and he quickly turned away and ran towards the door to find it blocked by Roger.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;We're your family now,&quot; Roger informed him.  &quot;Through good or bad.&quot;  Shane looked at him for a moment, then turned to look at Debbie.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Can I ask you for something then?&quot; Shane trembled, fearful to ask for anything, not wanting to be rejected.  Debbie nodded.  &quot;It's something I've never had since my parents died.&quot;  He looked hesitantly up at Roger who looked at him with peeked interest.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Go on,&quot; Debbie encouraged, sensing Shane's hesitation, her own curiosity getting the better of her since the boy had never asked for a thing before.  Shane looked at her, wanting to ask, but the words just would not come out.  Finally, he decided to just lift his arms up and open his clenched fists towards her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Debbie immediately responded to his request, her experience as a mother understanding it all too well.  It was the kind of hug he dreamt about, the kind he had seen kids give their parents when they got picked up at school.  The warmth of her embrace moved deep into his soul, melting the ice that had formed there from that long, dark night.  He soon felt added warmth as Roger had embraced them both.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That one hug forever changed Shane.  Roger taught Shane how to deal with bullies and Tom and Pete served as role models as well.  A year later the adoption was formalized.  His mom and sister made sure he knew how to treat girls and to be a gentleman, his sister constantly lecturing him about leaving the toilet seat up.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He went on to play football in school.  Although he wasn't the best athlete, he gave it everything he had.  Like with most teenagers, he would test his parents love and patience periodically, but most of the time stayed in a good relationship with them.  Though he wasn't the best athlete, he became an inspiration to his teammates.  When they would gripe about their parents cheering for them at their games, he'd tell them his story and give them an all new perspective on how fortunate they were to have their parents.  Shane became determined to not ever let life get him down and beat him again, and with the help of his family, that dream became a reality. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=peaches116>peaches116</A> at: 3/20/03 12:02:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heartjoys>heartjoys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>A velvet-steel wannabe</span><br>  Posts: 165<br> <font color=#B87333>(3/20/03 6:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.celticisledesign.co.uk/cushionround.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: When Dreams Come True</span><hr size=1> I don't have time to read it this morning...but want you to know that I'm printing it out to take with me!<br>

Very well written, I think!  Shows so much emotion and the heart of the matter with Shane.  How our tough exteriors usually hide our sensitivities and needs for acceptance and love from others.  You found the weak spot and the cure in the story.  It's also very relatable, for me.  Thanks, I really enjoyed it Peaches! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :fl --><img src=http://www.geocities.com/bat3193/smiley6/flowers1.gif ALT=":fl"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I wasn't sure if you wanted a critique, since you've already turned it in-- I'd love to know how you scored on this assignment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't know if you intended it, but this paragraph is poignant; it captured a sense of emotion I wasn't expecting.  Good job <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
