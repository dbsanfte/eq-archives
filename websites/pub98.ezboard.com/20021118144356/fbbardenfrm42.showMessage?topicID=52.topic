<br>
as you enter, you can go either to the right, which leads to a large smoky room with a long rectangular bar which runs almost the length of the room before opening to a dance floor OR on the left you're lead through this wierd doorway/hallway to a small bar which opens into a more chilledout room.<br>
<br>
i went in and headed  right. got inside and found my friends most of whom i haven't seen i a few weeks if not a month (love working 7 days a week <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). anyway. <br>
<br>
try though we might, we couldn't prevent large amounts of the night to discussion the country's current terrors. and the possible futures that might be unfolding over the next few days, weeks, etc. <br>
<br>
reserves are already being called in. that's about half my family. i've got one of my best friends who's slated to be finished with boot camp at the end of the week. <br>
<br>
fortunately for ME everyone i knew in new york was safe. however, this tragedy will go on to procure many many more as america begins to raise itself up for battle. something i have NO doubts will come to pass.  i'm not a violent person. i'm just NOT interested in that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
i don't advocate any sort of non-retaliation policy as that would be an open door to terrorist organizations throughout the war. <br>
<br>
what scares the hell  out of me is how this will be handled. right and left i hear of people going  where the @#%$ is afganistan anyway and in that SAME breath, saying &quot;NUKE 'EM&quot;   <br>
<br>
MY GOD! <br>
<br>
how much does THAT make me fear for my life?! tempers are flaring. FEAR, which is a thousand times worse, is flaring. i fear for the hatred and ignorance this act of terrorism will bring to my country. <br>
<br>
as i sat around in the club last night, i couldn't help but look at the fairly empty setting and the kids inbetween states of solitude and manic dancing and wonder if all the fears and thoughts going on in my own head were also jumping 'round in theirs. <br>
is this what will become of us? i wonder how the kids who were home during world war 2 reacted. i imagine it was much the same thing i experienced last night. a cloud of somberness over a half full club and conversations constantly drifting back and forth between daily events and fear for the future. <br>
<br>
if things go far enough (who knows?!?!) and a draft is begun (though with the numbers of americans who are spouting and eager to run to the calls of war at the moment that may not be necessary) how many people do i know who could be affected by that? <br>
everyone. <br>
<br>
perhaps i'm being a bit forward in my anticipation of the future. i hope to GOD it doesn't come to all this. but right now there's no way to know. <br>
<br>
my head's too full....i need a drain.<br>

<br>
I just wish I could say something here to reassure you.  But the events of this week have made me speechless - which is VERY unusual for me - and I'm scared like you, but a bit less, because obviously you are living in the country that is under fire.<br>
<br>
I feel for you.  I really do.  Realistically, yes there will be plenty of worry and concern.  Nobody can deny that.  But once we have pushed past this, we stand more chance that the world will be a better place.  Maybe that sounds somewhat idealistic, but the possibility is there.<br>
<br>
For someone to do something as drastic as this, it takes a lot, but the ultimate thing to remember is that they are doing it to make a point.  In no way does that excuse their behaviour, but I am hopeful that the Americans in power will sit up and take notice.  I sound like I don't know what the Americans' response has been, well that's not the case, but I hope that in the end we will draw conclusions and work out a way to prevent this sort of thing from happening again.<br>
<br>
That's what we all want, isn't it?  We can't change what's happened, but we can strive to combat this feud, and eliminate future possibilities of these terrible events recurring.  OK, so it might not be as easy as that, but I think that one of the critical catalysts of peace is one that can be very complicated - Compromise.  If we all agreed either to consent or to disagree, surely the acceptance of different rights, opinions and values would shine through as a mature attitude which shows that we are all different.<br>
<br>
I personally do not feel that war will solve anything.  It might say to the Palestinians that the Americans are not going to put up with their behaviour.  But in my experience, aggression breeds aggression, so if the Americans fight back, the Palestinians will in turn, retaliate.  If that is what we want, then bring it on.  Just be prepared to face the consequences.<br>
<br>
That's my viewpoint, anyway - it's not necessarily the be all and end all - feel free to argue against me!  Meanwhile, Candace, I think you need a lot of hugs.  So roll on Bedrock.<br>

i really appreciate the support. which is why i posted that here and not anywhere else. to be completely honest, i don't even want to post anything of that nature on intensity. which saddens me. but the behavior i've seen from people, not just there but in general, saddens me and scares me a lot.<br>
<br>
the people who really need the hugs though are those who lost loved ones in the attacks. <br>
<br>
i pray to the highest of powers that this atrocity DOES indeed bring us together, but i fear the extent to which this will fall before that happens. <br>
<br>
headline for tomorrow's sunday paper: palestine agrees to american aid....<br>
<br>
what hope is there now? full scale war of the 21st century and all the technology that will incorporate (the bad tech is what i'm afraid of, bio-chemical/nuclear..) will soon be launched. <br>
<br>
i just pray i get to london first.<br>

As much as Ive been saddened by the recent events - I cant help but be scared out my wits(didn't know if I could use french ben. :-P) of the future. the possibility of war. IMO military strikes will be completely unjustified but sadly I can also see no alternative. Many people need revenge. I saw a british poll and 52% of people want immediate strike actions, and the poll was held among britans. Its fairly safe to assume that figure will be a whole lot higher across with you...<br>
<br>
So whats the solution, someone tell me? Ive been thinking about this since tuesday and ive my efforts have been worthless - apart from falling out with a spate of people(I read your other post Ben, thanks for referring to me :-/ ) <br>
<br>
I'm afraid revenge is wrong.... but then, what is the right thing to do? I dont know.<br>

<br>
Regarding Intensity, I don't really think I should comment too much on that.  I do think there are a few changes that could be made to improve the Intensity community.  I feel a bit unhappy with the fact that it's password protected, for instance.  The reasoning behind that is it keeps out any unwanted GU posters.  What's the point in that when feuds break out on Intensity anyway?  That's all I'll say on the subject, anyway.<br>
<br>
To you both - I don't think it's the fact that we're in agreement here, I think it's that we seem to be more willing to accept each other's viewpoints at bbarden than elsewhere.  That might be because the guy who runs the place accepts that we all have our own opinions.  So it's bound to shine through the rest of the community (he hopes!).<br>
<br>
Dash, I am sorry I made reference to you.  I did have the decency to omit names, but seeing as you have brought it up, please realise that it's not a specific gripe with you.  Or indeed anyone else who I was referring to.  The point I was trying to make is that I find it sad that war broke out at the community in question.  I believe we are not a feuding community at bbarden.  Evidence of this is shown, for example, of the difference in your behaviour between the two communities - I think you are more laid back here.  That might suggest that a community still needs to look at why this is so. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for a solution.... if only I had the answers..... I just don't think that war should be the way to go... <br>

Look after yourselves peeps.<br>
