Dear John, <br>
As you know, We've been working real hard in our town to get prayer back in our schools. Finally, the school board approved a plan of teacher-led prayer with the children participating at their own option. Children not wishing to participate were to be allowed to stand out in the hallway during prayer time. We hoped someone would sue us so we could go all the way to the Supreme Court and get the old devil-inspired ruling reversed. <br>
<br>
Naturally, we were all excited by the school board action. As you know, our own little Billy (not so little, any more though) is now in the second grade. Of course, Margaret and I explained to him no matter what the other kids did, he was going to stay in the classroom and participate. After the first day of school, I asked him &quot;How did the prayer time go?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Fine.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Did many kids go out into the hallway?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Two. <br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent. How did you like your teacher's prayer?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It was different, Dad. Real different from the way you pray.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh? Like how?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;She said, 'Hail Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners...'&quot; <br>
<br>
The next day I talked with the principal. I politely explained I wasn't prejudiced against Catholics but I would appreciate Billy being transferred to a non-Catholic teacher. The principal said it would be done right away. <br>
<br>
At supper that evening I asked Billy to say the blessings. He slipped out of his chair, sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, raised his hand palms up in the air and began to hum. You'd better believe I was at the principal's office at eight o'clock the next morning. &quot;Look,&quot; I said. 'I don't really know much about these Transcendental Meditationists, but I would feel a lot more comfortable If you could move Billy to a room where the teacher practices an older, more established religion.&quot; <br>
<br>
That afternoon I met Billy as soon as he walked in the door after school. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think you're going to like Mrs. Nakasone's prayer either, Dad.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Out with it.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;She kept chanting Namu Amida Butsu...&quot; <br>
<br>
The following morning I was waiting for the principal in the school parking lot. &quot;Look, I don't want my son praying to the Eternal Spirit of whatever to Buddha. I want him to have a teacher who prays in Jesus' name!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What about Bertha Smith?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent.&quot; <br>
<br>
I could hardly wait to hear about Mrs. Smith's prayer. I was standing on the front steps of the school when the final bell rang. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well?&quot; I asked Billy as we walked towards the car. <br>
<br>
&quot;Okay.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Okay what?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Mrs. Smith asked God to bless us and ended her prayer in Jesus' name, amen just like you.&quot; <br>
<br>
I breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Now we're getting some place.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;She even taught us a verse of scripture about prayer,&quot; said Billy. <br>
<br>
I beamed. &quot;Wonderful. What was the verse?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Lets see...&quot; he mused for a moment. &quot;And behold, they began to pray; and they did pray unto Jesus, calling him their Lord and their God.&quot; <br>
<br>
We had reached the car. &quot;Fantastic,&quot; I said reaching for the door handle. Then paused. I couldn't place the scripture. <br>
<br>
&quot;Billy, did Mrs. Smith say what book that verse was from?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Third Nephi, chapter 19, verse 18.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nephi what?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nephi,&quot; he said. &quot;It's in the Book of Mormon. <br>
<br>
The school board doesn't meet for a month. I've given Billy very definite instructions that at prayer time each day he's to go out into the hallway. I plan to be at that board meeting. If they don't do something about this situation, I'LL sue. I might even call the ACLU. I'LL take it all the way to the Supreme Court if I have to. I don't need schools or anybody else teaching my son about religion. We can take care of that ourselves at home and at church, thank you very much. <br>
<br>
Your brother, James <br>

I agree though I would never want my son having a catholic, Mormon, or someone else who doesn't have the same beliefs as me teaching him ANYTHING about religion.<br>
That is the parents job and their own business.  <br>
But I dont believe you should have to hide your religion when you go to school.  No matter what religion you are.  We are suppose to have freedom of religion right?<br>

*sigh*<br>
Every child in america is perfectly free to pray in school, to whatever god they want, whenever they want, wherever they want...as long as it is not disruptive to the classroom setting.<br>
Every student is allowed to bring their bible, their book of mormon, their bagahvad gita to school, and read it (again, as long as it's not disrupting classtime). <br>
Teachers that don't allow prayer/bible reading are in violation of the first amendment, and any ACLU lawyer would gladly fight that out in court for the child.<br>

They also assume all xians are the same and want the same thing in schools. JW's are xians but don't pledge or celebrate any of the religious holidays, but as you said there are too many heads buried in the sand.<br>

<br>
There is a big difference between students saying grace to themselves or praying before a test and leading prayer at school sponsored activities. The audience is there at an official school event where they are &quot;captive&quot; in a sense waiting to see their child receive a diploma. This is simply not the same as eating your lunch 10 feet away from a kid saying a prayer and indeed IS a SOCAS violation.<br>
<br>
As for equating hearing a prayer with religious education, well, that's stretching it. It is ceratinly &quot;exposure&quot; to religion, but I would not call that the same things as education.<br>

Equality and tolerance applies to all or it isn't really equality.  If they want to &quot;Hail Satan!&quot; and espouse at length the virtues of the carnal self and glory of egoism to the condemnation of xianity, would you find it 'educational'?  If it were in front of your impressionable children and they walked away appreciating the glory of personal achievement, self worth and intelligence, how would you feel?<br>
