The first new episode kicking off the second half of season three. If that sounds convoluted, congratulations, that's just how this story shapes up. The story supposedly is about how the show would have progressed with Rhade as the captain rather than Hunt. In watching it a second time, it occurs to me that the sole purpose of this episode was to, surprise, build up the lead star, by creating a convoluted series of loopholes to close, that didn't even exist before this episode! That is the chief flaw in a story that some ironically laud for continuity.<br>
<br>
Gone from the episode, Dylan Hunt's hologram pops up every so often to lecture Rhade on what a lousy job he's doing by comparison. This episode should really be called &quot;The Egotistical Man&quot;, because it is one long paen to how wonderful and super Dylan Hunt was as a captain, compared to Rhade. Rhade as a captain would be a disaster, answering the question that apparently no one had asked beforehand.  Dylan (or Kevin Sorbo's) message is clear, and almost seems fannish: &quot;The show's fans have told us how lousy they think I handled the forming of the Commonwealth, and the facing of various threats over the years. Now look at how well Rhade does. If I did a lousy job, well his was even worse! So you should commend me for what you get. Have you seen my force lance?&quot;<br>
<br>
The episode opens with Harper hauling a coffin out of deep storage, past rows of uncounted similar coffins. Harper questions the need to exhume the corpse for an honored burial, and Dylan notes there is a scar on Rhade's hand that wasn't there before. This is the first creation of a supposed loophole that didn't exist before this episode. (Why do I complain about this? Now if the scar had been there in the Series Premiere, and Dylan wondered about it, then it might be a cool case of foreshadowing. As it is it's just pointless.)<br>
<br>
We then switch to the 2nd season episode &quot;Ouroboros&quot;, where Rhade is now cast in Hunt's role. He is about to destroy the time machine that the Pyrians created to save Harper, when futuristic Trance and Beka &quot;warp in&quot; to talk him out of it. Everything I just described in the previous above two sentences is from memory, the casual viewer is left with absolutely no explanation of who or what they are watching. Get used to it, the remainder of the episode proceeds this way. We are shown an alternate timeline where Rhade killed Hunt in the Series Premiere. From there we jump through random scenes from the first two seasons of the show, showing how Rhade would deal with each crisis that Dylan solved with his brilliance (-cough- dumb luck).<br>
<br>
When they did this sort of plot on Star Trek, it resulted in what many consider to be the greatest Next Generation episode, &quot;Yesterday's Enterrpise&quot;. It started on the same premise as this episode, change one thing and see the results. But whereas that show successfully focused on ONE RESULTING EPISODE, Andromeda's version jumps all over the big plots of the first two seasons. Throughout they jump back and forth in time, there is not a chance a casual viewer could figure out what is going on. I've seen some describe Babylon 5 as hard for someone to get into, but at least they made an effort to 1) Make episodes stand alone as comprehensive stories, and 2) explain things along the way to new viewers. The writers (departing Stentz and Miller) set themselves an impossible task in this episode, there is no way to tell this story and still have it make sense to new viewers. (And many regular viewers I would imagine.)<br>
<br>
Rhade violently introduces himself to Harper, takes out Tyr's mercenaries and the nightsider Gerentex. We are shown the briefest of flashes to comprehend that Rhade has made the salvagers his new crew. Harper creates a holographic game partner for Rhade, this is really just the gimmick to ensure that the dead Dylan Hunt does not interfere with the lead star's screentime. The sequence is grating and entirely predictable. After every commercial break, Rhade goes through the motions of reacting to crisis that Dylan Hunt had handled in the first two seasons. After failing in some way, he returns to his quarters where Dylan's hologram lectures him on what a lousy captain he is by comparison. This is really a crude message to the remaining fans: Stop criticizing the direction of the series, here's &quot;proof&quot; we've conveniently created to show that Dylan is the best captain of all!<br>
<br>
It's like reading an Iraqi newspaper's glowing description of the heroic leadership of Saddam Hussein. Phony honors and victories are awarded, invented out of thin air, to build up a guy who apparently wasn't appearing heroic enough before this episode. Efforts are made to tie this episode to &quot;loopholes&quot; in the Series Premiere, Angel Dark, Demon Bright, and Ouroboros. But none of these loopholes existed before the Unconquerable Man. If Rhade had been shown in a corridor in Ouroborus, then hey, clever foreshadowing. If Rhade's scar had been shown in the season premiere, clever again. But as it is, they invent these loopholes and then resolve them, as if they were major nagging questions for the series. <br>
<br>
Thanks to the inept, abrasive leadership of Rhade, Beka and Rev Bem leave in the Maru, Rhade has to kill Tyr, and the Dylan hologram cheerfully informs him he's losing worlds in his alliance, also.<br>
<br>
The point is repeatedly driven home in this episode that the Nietzchian people are a failure, their philosophies are a dumb idea, and so forth. Once a central and interesting premise of the Andromeda universe, the writers seem to be saying the whole idea was a bad one, to hell with the Nietzchians and their place in the scheme of things. The pattern for this show seems to be introduce an interesting premise or alien species, and then never do anything with them. (Or worse, trivialize them.)<br>
<br>
Supposedly a great example of continuity, this episode actually highlights the nonexistent continuity of the third season. Rommie shows Rhade multiple camera views of boarding parties, including a dramatic entrance by Tyr (chuckle), yet they apparently lost 99% of their cameras in several episodes this season (Mad to be Saved, Our Hearts Will Fly Away, etc). Rhade has Rommie uses Andromeda's gravity to hold Tyr to the floor, yet they forgot they had this ability in multiple intruder alerts this season. Rhade and Beka are lovers, changing the premise (twice no less) that Nietzchians don't find human females attractive mates.<br>
<br>
While I've enjoyed GEORDIE JOHNSON's work as Rhade in all his appearances prior to this, his delivery seems deadened in many scenes. His absolute worst is the following exchange with Beka:<br>
<br>
Beka: I came as soon as I heard.<br>
Rhade: Harper's like your family. If there's one thing a Nietzchian understands, it's loyalty. I miss you, Beka.<br>
<br>
He delivers these lines like Dan Ackroyd in the movie version of Dragnet. &quot;Just the facts, ma'am.&quot;<br>
<br>
Speaking of Rhade, everyone referred to him by his last name in his prior appearances. Yet here it's always his first name, &quot;Gaheris&quot;. I know, I know, they're all on a first name basis with him now. But again, the casual viewer may barely remember who Rhade was, but they won't know who Gaheris is. (They might end up thinking this is Rhade's lookalike descendant from the 2nd season.)<br>
<br>
Eventually it all ties back to 2nd season's Ouroboros, the much-despised 2nd season episode where we lost interesting Purple Trance. Tying an episode's central premise to an episode widely-criticized isn't the best of moves, perhaps the intent was to reconstruct the meaningless events of that episode into something that makes sense. That goal got lost along the way, in the end nothing has changed and we don't know any more about the weirdness that occured in Ouroboros than before. It's as if we were watching a pilot to a spin-off TV series, this episode adds nothing to the Andromeda universe. Rather, it detracts. <br>
<br>
Once the episode starts doing the &quot;dimensional shifts&quot; seen in Ouroboros, any viewer (including me) loses all hope of keeping track of what's going on. Ouroboros was a big enough mess as it was. You don't &quot;explain things&quot; by taking that and mixing it with new reactions by an alternate captain. But that is the precise premise. We get to see futuristic Trance introduced again, highlighting again not a bright point but a low point for the series. Why remind viewers of one of the changed premises that helped tank the ratings?<br>
<br>
We return to the scene near the start of the episode, of Rhade ready to blast the Ouroboros time machine, with future Trance and Beka appearing to talk him out of it.<br>
<br>
Rhade (seeing weird new Trance): Beka, who the hell is this?<br>
<br>
Very funny line. You'd think if Trance's goal was to come back in time and convince the captain that she can be trusted, she wouldn't knot a dozen weird loops in her hair to look as odd as possible. She couldn't take 15 minutes to make herself look a little closer to old, trustworthy Trance? Anyway, Trance tells him what a lousy captain he's been, and why he should be dead and not Dylan. Incredibly, he believes her! (If you saw weird Trance for the first time and she tells you to kill yourself, would you believe her?)<br>
<br>
Trance: Your life can still mean something. You still have contributions to make, but you are not the one.<br>
<br>
What sort of contribution? Being put in a space coffin is a contribution?<br>
<br>
Rhade: I can still rebuild what I helped to destroy!<br>
Trance: With no friends? No allies? <br>
<br>
Well, I think the point has been driven home that Dylan Hunt is the right man at the right time. That really is the only net effect of this episode, contrived at every step of the way to reach this conclusion. I don't like being led by the nose as a viewer, I find it insulting. And I find it insulting that the only way Dylan Hunt can be built up is to show that someone else would come up short in every instance by comparison. That's no way to build up a hero, and it doesn't make Dylan Hunt look good. It's forced, and it shows.<br>
<br>
There are some bright spots in this episode. I liked Beka's smooches with the alternate captain. I liked how Rhade immediately ordered a course change to the Perseid homeworld when told of a way to save Harper. It seems Harper grew on him. And I liked seeing old Purple Trance. We heard Rev Bem's voice off-screen, but I have to take issue with anyone who says this was something Brent Stait was brought back for. What Rev Bem said could have been from a prior episode, and they sent the actor a check for using his voice again.<br>
<br>
Let's wrap this up, Rhade is talked out of blasting the time machine, and the three of them are enveloped in the time distortion and disappear. Rhade and Trance reappear in the hallway of the Andromeda Ascendant, 300 years ago. How did the time distortion know to drop them there and not Beka? As soon as Trance finishes chatting with Rhade, she whispers something to him and the time distortion sweeps her away. Again, huh? Why didn't it randomly sweep him away and leave Trance there? (Yes, I know it appears as though future Trance is somehow controlling all this, but it was never explained or mentioned in any way in Ouroboros, or here.)<br>
<br>
Good, reformed Rhade shoots his 300-year old counterpart, and then shoots the Than at the helm. Uh, wasn't this supposed to be the heroic Rhade? Why did he shoot the Than? For effect? Rhade gives Dylan a speech about the Commonwealth and the Nietzchians, and it is apparently footage from the premiere. (I know this because Dylan calls him &quot;Rhade&quot;, not &quot;Gaheris&quot; at first). Rhade dies, and seeing this scene again adds nothing to our understanding of Rhade's motives as shown in the Premiere and &quot;Forced Perspective&quot;. In fact, it diminishes them.<br>
<br>
We close by returning to Dylan and Harper in the Andromeda morgue, my brother suggests that the &quot;wavy Andromeda&quot; effect could simply indicate that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dylan had been daydreaming,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and imagined the entire episode. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Since the only thing that changed in the end was that little scar on Rhade's hand, I guess we'll never know. A fine stand-alone episode, for another show. As an Andromeda episode, this was a terrible mess without point from beginning to end. Some questions:<br>
<br>
* (from my brother) If Rhade really shot his 300-year old counterpart, then there were two Rhade corpses on Andromeda at the time she was hauled out of the black hole! Did Rhade dump his other body out an airlock? (chuckle)<br>
<br>
* (again from my brother) We're shown the scene from Ouroboros where Purple Trance and Future Trance have their knowing little chat, and Purple Trance walks off to follow a time distortion to another reality. My brother asked, &quot;It's too bad the audience couldn't have followed her there.&quot;<br>
<br>
* Was this episode meant to build up the audience's esteem of Dylan Hunt, or Kevin Sorbo? The character was dead the whole episode, yet <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>it almost appeared as if</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the actor managed to be around the whole time to make derisive comments about Rhade's ability and decisions as captain. (And Rhade kept this insulting hologram running for two seasons?)<br>
<br>
* Since nothing in this alternate reality delved into the third season, can we assume this is also an alternate reality that future Trance can rescue us out of? Please?<br>
<br>
* Final question: With all the alternate realities, time hopping, and dimensional distortion, why didn't the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>space kitten</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> make an appearance? It would have made as much sense as the rest of it.<br>
<br>
I can see this episode has received a lot of praise, I guess people like seeing random clips of some of their favorite plots from prior seasons. I can understand that. But I can't see this episode as doing anything but driving away new viewers, and leaving old viewers dismayed about all the odd changes that have been forced onto the show since Ouroboros.<br>

I was really disappointed. As you said Ogami, the show <br>
was convoluted and confusion reigned. I like the Rhade<br>
charector but I've always thought he was played flat.<br>
You are right tho. It was even more so in this ep.<br>

<br>
I still don't get what Tyre was doing to get himself killed<br>
at that moment. Tyrants must not be happy as Tyre appears<br>
to be a whipped dog in both realities.<br>
<br>
What a missed opportunity. Why did'nt Rhade just go back<br>
and stall things until they entered the event horizon? Then <br>
he could have been in  the present with Dylan. That could have been interesting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally I hope the other Zack/Ashe eps are better than<br>
this one.<br>

EXCELLENT!!!<br>
<br>
I didn't know about the Dylan hologram, but I did know the basic premise of the show and I have to admit that the Dylan Hunt as savior angle always bothered me.<br>
<br>
Ash and Zack tried to talk up the Gaheris Rhade as ultimate badass angle at the old SS to be sure, but when they say that he was inferior to Hunt in EVERY way except pure whoop ass potential, then they're not really giving Rhade much are they?<br>
<br>

<br>
Hi Mack,<br>
<br>
The first time I watched this, you could have seen a big question mark over my head (if I were a cartoon character). It had some shining moments, but that was because I am the only person in my state who could sort out all the episode references. The second time I watched it with my brother, he had a lot of good observations. It really sunk into me how the whole episode was a lovefest for Dylan's perfect leadership, and Rhade wasn't even permitted small victories in comparison to Dylan's divinity. <br>
<br>
If they had made it so Rhade loses some and does some better than Dylan, hey I'm all for the alternate reality. But upon every episode reference, Rhade slinks back to his quarters for more insults from hologram Dylan. Why? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>As you said Ogami, the show was convoluted and confusion reigned. I like the Rhade charector but I've always thought he was played flat.You are right tho. It was even more so in this ep.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Unfortunately, as I like the actor. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>know you know what your talking about but it's Persiads. Someone could give you a lot of grief about it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I tend to type long reviews, I caught the mistake and decided I didn't care enough to correct it. For anyone who dares to give me grief about it (grin), I will inform them that Andromeda has abandoned interesting aliens like the Perseids in favor of critter wave aliens. (Like the Ogami.) So it's a moot discussion point whether I get their name right. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I still don't get what Tyre was doing to get himself killed at that moment. Tyrants must not be happy as Tyre appears to be a whipped dog in both realities.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
On my second viewing I noticed that original Rhade gets blasted by new Rhade in precisely the same manner as Tyr did. Only this time, Rhade didn't have Andromeda fix the deck plates. Speaking of which, upon new Rhade's and Trance's teleportation into the corridor, why didn't Andromeda immediately sound Intruder Alert? Rhade shouldn't have been able to walk up to old Rhade, he and Trance should have been on the video displays just like we saw happen earlier. So  much for continuity.<br>

No matter how cleverly they are written; they always annoy me.  This episode was no exeption.  <br>
<br>
Even before the first commercial my SO was yelling at me to explain what the frell had happened, what had he missed.  During that first commercial, I ran down every point that I had seen in the episode up to that point.  The disgusted look on his face was priceless as he groaned, &quot;You mean I didn't miss anything.  Good lord, three minutes into the show; I'm totally confused and I didn't miss anything.&quot;  His face grew sadder the longer we watched.  He was so dejected that he looked like a beaten dog by the end of the episode.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'll pass the one question he had when the episode ended.  &quot;Why?  Why go to all that trouble to redeem Rhade?  What was the point?  It doesn't make Dylan look any better to be a poor second choice.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I was inclined to agree with that statement.  In my book, we re-lived some of the most depressing and controversial moments of past episodes to learn two things that we already knew.  First, we confirmed that the Nietzscheans we've been seeing are not all that Nietzscheans were meant to be.  They've chosen self interest over enlightenment to their detriment.  I thought the whole point of the Prophet was to correct that mistake.  Second, we confirmed that Trance is not working alone.  She is part of a group working together to shape/reshape the universe according to their will.<br>
<br>
Finally, setting gravity field plot holes aside for the moment, why would Andromeda let Rhade live and accept him as Captain after he committed treason?  I remember the episode where they rescued the captured AI's/ships.  Those ships killed the Nietzscheans who attempted to take them over.  It was offensive to watch Andromeda accept that betrayal with a little snit but no bite.  She has threatened to kill Tyr for such an act; but she has only harsh words for Rhade.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I felt dirty for her after I watched this episode.  It was like she docilely accepted rape by Rhade.  Strong words, I know; but her behavior disturbed me more than anyone else's.  <br>
<br>

I was disturbed as well by Rommie's convenient acceptance of Rhade, but I hadn't quite thought of it that way...  And yet. Yes, it was pretty shocking.  I'll add this - it also bugs me that she (who we've seen up till now caring for her crew in a motherly warship kind of way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) could so conveniently snag Tyr's legs with heavy gravity, knowing what Rhade is likely to do.  It just made her party to her own abuser, if you ask me...<br>

By the Prophet are you referring to the Progenitor Reborn? The Nietz looking for him to come could be construed as their knowing they've gone wrong.<br>

<br>
Well, this is...hmmm.<br>
<br>
Uhm, I wasn't crazy about this ep.  Because of two reasons.<br>
<br>
Rhade looks extremely idiotic<br>
<br>
Dylan is not exactly shown in a good lite either.<br>
<br>
First off, the first attack.  I rewatched and rewatched, here's what bugged me about that first scene.  Dylan just stands there and takes the hit to the mid area, doesn't move from position or anything-oh he fires but...<br>
<br>
In the second attack even though Rhade does miss him clearly, Dylan not only fires his weapon but he sidesteps.  Which shows that he was intelligent enough to do that.  Which was what we saw in UTN.<br>
<br>
Next thing was that they totally took the lines out about how Rhade did not want to join the Nietzchean Empire seekers until the Magog Treaty.  To me this always made Rhade a villian that had a true purpose.  Of course I think that was took out because after all Rhade accepted the Magog.  And BTW how would he know what a Magog Monk would look like?  The Wayist were not formed until after the fall.<br>

Now for those that had a problem with Rommie accepting Rhade.  I did too.  But then I realized that's not Dylan in that Holo.  I know it looks like him and Harper took files and everything he could find on the guy but that's all up to the interpretation of the programmer.  And we're dealing with a super computer here.<br>
<br>
Most of the time when HoloDylan was goading Rhade, that was Rommie.  That was Rommie in Dance of the Mayflies and BAMSR.  Remember her sharp little tongue?  I think she did more damage to Rhade then anything.  In fact his need for Dylans image was his first mistake.<br>
<br>
Now I did like how the Nietzcheans were shown to be the blow hearts that I have always said they are.  And I love Harper<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I really don't think there was much here to get.  Nor do I think that confused viewers bought into the dumbing down, as she said in one of the other threads.  Confusion is a legitimate reaction, especially from viewers who hadn't seen the original episodes.  I understood the episode perfectly; I was never lost. Yet I remain confused as to the purpose of this episode in the minds of the writers.  <br>
<br>
Hibblette--The HoloDylan wasn't the problem.  Rhade killed the real Dylan on the Andromeda while Dylan was Captain.  Andromeda should have had a serious problem with that act of murder and treason.  QT is right; the writers made her party to her abuser, an absolutely disgusting choice.<br>
<br>
Ani--yes, by the Prophet, I mean the progenitor reborn.  The scuttlebutt so far describes him as the uniter of the prides.  He should, potentially, be so much more.  He should bring enlightenment back to the Nietzscheans.<br>

The only point were it really sounded like Rommie was trying to effect Dylan was when he did the mocking line and told Gaheris he talked to much, it was about halfway through the show.<br>
<br>
What I'm saying is that it was Rommie doing all the things that Ogami is saying about how, Dylan would do this and Dylan that.  That was Rommie doing that under the guise of Dylans face and voice.<br>
<br>
But yea, that's not a good thing about how she didn't do what Milli did in Knight, Death and the Devil.<br>
<br>
Dylan would never have agreed to the killing of Tyr over the bones being on board because he hasn't done it yet.  And it's just not Dylan's style to go that route, remember he wouldn't drop the Nova's at Hephaestus. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ogami1>Ogami1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Alpha(Opacity=100, FinishOpacity=0, Style=1, StartX=0, StartY=0, FinishX=580, FinishY=0)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Official Critter Wave........</span></td></tr></table> </span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(1/27/03 11:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~jo567779/coily.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Review: The Egotistical Man</span><hr size=1> Hi Lil,<br>
<br>
I'm surprised you liked it. The plot seemed overly contrived to make Dylan look like a better captain. I thought it lessened him. Why couldn't it be enough for the episode to show that Rhade would have been competent enough? Instead, he can only be portrayed as a complete fuck-up to make Dylan's leadership look good. That sucks. Now here is a Dylan fan's dream come true, not only is Dylan the best captain in one universe, but he's the best captain in any conceivable universe.<br>
<br>
This'll make him feel cockier than a dozen babes-of-the-week. <br>

Tell him it's the wrong question. Just before Rhade decided to kill himself, Trance whispered something to him. What did Trance whisper to him that caused him to want to commit suicide? Answer: She told him what the third season would be like. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I can't imagine Commander Data doing that on Star Trek, Rommie was poorely served here. Of course, her lack of a response to the new captain wsa purely because they lacked time. It should have been a three-parter struggle for control just for Rhade to disable Rommie. But then, her intelligence varies with the demands of the plot from week to week. It's sad to see these interesting characters be reduced to cartoons.<br>

<br>
I'm honored you chose my review as your first post on the board. Welcome!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Uhm, I wasn't crazy about this ep. Because of two reasons. Rhade looks extremely idiotic. Dylan is not exactly shown in a good lite either.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
My problem is that Rhade's character was extremely well-explored in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Forced Perspective.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> That's the one where Dylan's on trial for a mission he went on 300 years ago, and he starts remembering all the &quot;clues&quot; Rhade was giving him during their Go games. To me, this new episode tried to do the same plot, only worse.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>In the second attack even though Rhade does miss him clearly, Dylan not only fires his weapon but he sidesteps. Which shows that he was intelligent enough to do that. Which was what we saw in UTN.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It's lucky my reviews aren't live transcripts. At this precise scene I said to my brother, &quot;Look, Dylan sees the blast coming at him at the speed of light, and moves out of the way! What a guy.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Next thing was that they totally took the lines out about how Rhade did not want to join the Nietzchean Empire seekers until the Magog Treaty. To me this always made Rhade a villian that had a true purpose. Of course I think that was took out because after all Rhade accepted the Magog. And BTW how would he know what a Magog Monk would look like? The Wayist were not formed until after the fall.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The plot points I could identify went into my review. This episode was a lot of work, not for thinking, but for filling in the sloppiness of the plot. (Good point about recognizing a Wayist, maybe Rhade read up on the latest cults just before being shot.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Now for those that had a problem with Rommie accepting Rhade. I did too. But then I realized that's not Dylan in that Holo. I know it looks like him and Harper took files and everything he could find on the guy but that's all up to the interpretation of the programmer. And we're dealing with a super computer here.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This is something my brother noticed, what exactly did Harper guess at to make this Dylan? What was his reference material? Dylan Hunt giving a medal at an award ceremony to somebody? Highly implausible, but I was willing to overlook it if the hologram made a contribution to the plot. I don't think he did, other than to make Rhade feel depressed. (Quite a feat to make a Nietzchian lose his confidence.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Most of the time when HoloDylan was goading Rhade, that was Rommie. That was Rommie in Dance of the Mayflies and BAMSR. Remember her sharp little tongue?

<br>
If this had been acknowledged and made into a plot point, that would have made it a whole lot more interesting. Sadly, you're not one of the writers. I would have rather watched this version, one where Rommie and the crew work to restore reality *in spite of* Rhade. Not with his help. It didn't make sense.<br>

<br>
And I think that this with the HoloDylan being actually Rommie in control was a point in the plot.  It's subtle and not a big deal made out of it, but it's there.<br>
<br>
It's one of those things that I can find enjoyment with the episode.<br>
