She did a sweep of her security cameras, taking notice of the comings and goings of various people in various places. She chatted anonymously with cyber “friends” in virtual chat rooms. She checked on Prophet’s room in the Underground, and clicked her view off almost quicker than she turned it on.... eeeeeew, her brother was gross.<br>
It was good to be safely back in her quiet secret haven. The past few months had been a bit hard. Usually Prophet was the protector and care giver. Here in Santa Carla, she had been left to her own devices quite a bit.<br>
And now she was supposed to represent the Family. She giggled maniacally and accidentally pulled the head off of a stuffed animal... but it wasn’t one she cared about. Cybel focused by working on her latest security hack. Should she actually try to take care of this strange motley group she was supposed to speak for? Should she act only to take care of herself and her brother? Were those two things mutually exclusive or inclusive? She was very confused, years of scrabbling to survive as they could, had not given her much socialization.<br>
And Santa Carla was just ass-backwards as well. The very chaos that allowed her and Prophet to settle in, also gave Cybel none of the structure and politics she was used to having to survive against.<br>
“Hey Sis, let’s go hunting.” Prophet’s rough voice rasped over the intercom. There was another thing to get used to. Her brother’s speaking didn’t seem to attract as much notice as it should. No one in this City paid attention to the things that seemed important everywhere else...<br>
But hunting, hunting would be a welcome distraction to having to play grownup games. Cybel checked her work, set her security systems and went to the door. She pulled on her coat and put on her mask and hat and ventured out. <br>

Moved with care it hardly made a noise.<br>
The figure who climbed out of the work access was bundled in an impossibly long full trench coat with a high collar turned up. Despite being covered from head to toe, the figure was obviously female. She teetered for a moment, balanced on the edge of the hole in ridiculous stilletto heels, while jamming her hat down with exagerated delicacy. After a careful dusting and adjusting, she curtsied and tittered towards a security camera she knew was perched under the eves of a nearby building.<br>
Blue green eyes sparkled with impish glee above a ratty but once expensive scarf wrapped securely around her face. She crouched by the access and reaching down hauled up a duffle bag nearly as big as herself. Bag secured, she replaced the manhole cover. Hoisting the bag over one shoulder she tottered down the side walk. She swayed and listed, but never lost her way.<br>
Behind her trailed a childish nonsense song, &quot;lollee lollee lee loo lee loo leeee&quot;, in a soft lisping voice, and a scent like flowers, like the memory of Mama's perfume, apple blossoms in the spring, fresh plums splitting in the summer heat, a drift of sweetness from a bakery's midnite baking, lingering hauntingly in her wake.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=90.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=90.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/prefabs/ez/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.threadControl?topicID=90.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=90.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=90.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scbnforum58570frm12">Blackjack's Message Board <option value="scbnforum58570frm21">The Barrens<option value="scbnforum58570frm23">Domain Status<option value="scbnforum58570frm20">SchreckNET™ (Nos only)<option value="scbnforum58570frm18">The Santa Carla Tribune<option value="scbnforum58570frm19">Literary<option value="scbnforum58570frm16">Players Forum<option value="scbnforum58570frm17">Storyteller and Narrator Announcements</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF9300>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscbnforum58570>SCBN Forum</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fscbnforum58570frm19>Literary</a><font color=#FF9300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
