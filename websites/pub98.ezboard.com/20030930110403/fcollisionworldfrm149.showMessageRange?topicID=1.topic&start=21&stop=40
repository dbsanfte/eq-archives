Willow hummed softly as they walked along. It may be dark and creepy but she didn't mind too much. Earth would warn her of any iminent danger that decided to show it's ugly face.<br>
<br>
An image went through her mind and she jerked to a stop.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um.. guys..&quot; She started. The ugly face had arrived in the form of, &quot;I don't know if this affects us, but it's.. raining outside...a lot.

&quot;Pointy ears, I'm half nymph, luckily the whole 'nymphomaniac' genes were left out of my coding.

<br>
Thalia said nothing, but she was still a little confused about that whole 'half-nymph' thing Willow had been talking about...especially since she herself was a full-blooded nymph...<br>
<br>
Balder looked a little irritated.  *Damn!  I wanted to fight that guy, too,* he thought to himself, pouting a little (out of character, just so you know).  <br>
<br>
Nina skipped along beside them, having gotten over the teleporting thing, and studied her new surroundings in interest.  &quot;So, you're a half-nymph?  That's cool,&quot; she said, running up beside Willow with sudden energy, &quot;where are we going, anyway?&quot;  She poked at the torch-thing Eris had given her. <p>~Z<br>

&quot;And I would have liked to ask him what he was doing... taking me here. I'd very much like to know. I can tell for no good reason... but still i can't help but be the curious type.&quot;<br>

Why not? A little time to gather our bearings...&quot;  Eris shrugged, looking at Seifer who was really eager to just get going.  &quot;No use charging onward if the horse is pooped.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seifer raised an eyebrow at his best friend.  What was THAT supposed to mean??? He sighed, smiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright.  I suppose it wouldn't be polite to pick up and run.  But I'm keeping watch!&quot;  He patted his dangerous looking sword trustingly.  &quot;I'll be over there if you need me.&quot; He walked off aways into the mine, and sat down against the wall, peering into the darkness.<br>
<br>
Eris grinned at the rest of them and sat down, rummaging through her backpack for anything useful.  &quot;Anyone hungry?&quot; she quipped, pulling out some weird looking food that looked suspiciously like dried, smoked lizard.  &quot;It's a Lorion specialty...really good!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll have one!&quot; Seifer cried from down the shaft. Eris laughed as she tossed one of the smoked lizards at him, which he caught deftly in his hand, and ripped the head off with his teeth, chewing with his mouth politely closed, though they still heard crunching.  &quot;Mm! Chewy!&quot;<br>
<br>
Eris looked back at them all, reveling in the slightly nauseated looks on some of their faces...or so it seemed.  &quot;Anyone else?

Tried to steal a purse outta this noble's pocket.  He caught me and looked at me, and said, 'You're an impudent little street urchin and your parents did a horrible job raising you!'&quot;  she chuckled as she deepened her voice to sound like a man's.  &quot;And then I said, 'I have no parents, you dumb cluck!'  And he shut right up.  He didn't know, and therefore didn't know how to deal with it.  Of course, he never really cared in the first place...&quot;<br>

Don't have to ask, just help yourself! Have as many as you want.

&quot;Um...I don't know!&quot; she called back, winking at Willow, Kirin and the rest.  She laughed a bit then sighed.  &quot;Well, you get some sleep, Kirin.  Rest up good, and don't let those nightcrawlers bother you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nightmares,&quot; Seifer corrected.<br>
<br>
Eris's eyes widened slightly.  &quot;Um, yeah, those too.&quot;  She grinned and pulled a small blanket out of her pack(she has ALOT of stuff in there...it's like it never fills up) and covered the girl with it.

She wasn't going too far, so it was okay.  She obviously had a lot on her mind.<br>
<br>
He leaned back against the cool wall, looking up at the opposite side of the shaft. In the light of his torch, the wall glittered gold and silver, packed with precious metal.  He smiled, imagining the sparkles to be stars in the sky...<br>
<br>
He remembered lying in the field outside of Lorion, his home.  Only a teenager, oblivious to the woes of the world.  Lying in the dewy grass, under the light of the three moons Una, Oni and Lunai(always under the watchful gaze of Nulla, the black moon), and the sparkling stars.  He recalled counting them, a younger, spunkier teenager Eris laying beside him and helping him count.  Suddenly he'd lost count, and could not remember for the life of him what number he'd gone up to.  Eris had laughed and laughed.  He'd looked at her, her crisp red curls bouncing with laughter and sparkling from the dewdrops, her green eyes twinkling with happiness.<br>
<br>
Eris was always such a pretty child.  Even though people had mocked her and accused her of being a street urchin and a wretched orphan, he'd always heard their voices afterward, soft and sympathetic, because &quot;she was such an adorable little darling&quot;.  She had been extremely pretty, and seifer wasn't afraid to admit it...the noble's daughter's in Lorion needed to wear tons of makeup to have the looks Eris had naturally...but Eris wasn't pretty anymore...<br>
<br>
She was beautiful.<br>
<br>
Lost in dreams, his ears did not pick up the sound of stifled moaning coming from the sleeping group, even when it grew loud enough to catch Kirin's attention and anyone else who was awake.  But he woke suddenly when he heard cries of fright, and then frantic screaming and sobbing.<br>
<br>
He looked over, and cried out himself to see Eris writhing and tossing on the mine floor, her face twisting in pain and agony.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table
