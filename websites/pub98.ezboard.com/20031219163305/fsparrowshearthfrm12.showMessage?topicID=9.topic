<br>
I had the meanest mother in the world.  While other kids had candy for breakfast, I had to eat cereal, eggs, and toast.  While other kids had cakes and candy for lunch, I had a sandwich.  As you can guess, my dinner was different from other kid's dinner too.<br>
<br>
My mother insisted on knowing where we were at all times.  You'd think we were on a chain gang or something.  She had to know who our friends were and what we were doing.<br>
<br>
I am ashamed to admit it, but she actually had the nerve to break the child labor law.  She made us work!  We had to wash dishes, make the beds, and learn how to cook.  That woman must have stayed awake nights thinking up things for us kids to do and she insisted that we tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.<br>
<br>
By the time we were teenagers, she was much wiser and our life became more unbearable.  None of this tooting the car horn for us to come running, she embarrassed us to no end by insisting that friends come to the door to get us.<br>
<br>
I forgot to mention that most of our friends were allowed to date at the mature age of 12 or 13, but our old fashioned mother refused to let us date until we were 16.<br>
<br>
She really raised a bunch of squares.  None of us was ever arrested for shoplifting or busted for dope.  And who do we have to thank for this?   You're right, our mean mother.<br>
<br>
I am trying to raise my children to stand a little straighter and taller and I am secretly tickled to pieces when my children call me mean.  I thank God for giving me the meanest mother in the world.  Our country doesn't need a good five cent cigar, it needs more mean mothers like mine.<br>
<br>
Blessings on that wonderful woman!<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I LOVED YOU ENOUGH</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
     Some day when my children are old enough to understand<br>
the logic that motivates a mother, I will tell them:<br>
     I loved you enough to ask where you were going, with whom, and what time you would be home.<br>
     I love you enough to insist that you save your money and buy a bike for yourself even though we could afford to buy one for you.<br>
     I loved you enough to be silent and let you discover that your new best friend was a creep.<br>
     I loved you enough to make you take a Milky Way back to<br>
the drugstore (with a bite out of it) and tell the clerk,&quot; I stole<br>
this yesterday and want to pay for it.&quot;<br>
     I loved you enough to stand over you for two hours while you cleaned your room, a job that would have taken me 15 minutes.<br>
     I loved you enough to let you see anger, disappointment,<br>
and tears in my eyes. Children must learn that their parent's aren't perfect.<br>
     I loved you enough to let you assume the responsibility for your actions even when the penalties were so harsh they almost broke my heart.<br>
     But most of all, I loved you enough to say &quot;no&quot; when I knew you would hate me for it. Those were the most difficult battles of all.  I'm glad I won them, because in the end you won something too.<br>
--Author Unknown <br>
<br>
 <br>
Most of these two poems apply to my mom, and I love her dearly.  For having the patience with me when needed, and the discipline she used when needed, all because she loved me.  I know I make my kids angry many times, but I always try to give them the reasons behind my answer, even if they don't agree I've not left it at &quot;Because I said so,&quot; if I can help it.  I only hope and pray my kids will understand one day as I've come to understand my mom's reasoning behind all she did for me, even when I thought it was 'against' me.<br>
<br>
God bless,<br>
Von<br>

I'm lucky to have one of those mean mommies too-- and I like the line in the poem about secretly being glad to hear her kids call her &quot;mean&quot;...I hear that often enough...perhaps I should rethink my response to it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
