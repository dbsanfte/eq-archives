I operate from the definition of ‘choice’ as being more choices.  Once you limit choices, you become pro-control-others.  If you hit someone and kill them with your car, driving at the speed limit in clear conditions, should you be held to the same punishment as a drunk with no license in an unregistered car that intentionally runs down his ex?  But you chose to drive the car!  You are just as guilty as the guy who did it intentionally!  Burn them all!<br>

This argument doesn’t work.  It assumes a one-size-fits-all solution to a problem that by its very nature is fraught with case-by-case conditions.  What if the family has a defective child and wants to carry it?  Does the gov’t have any right to tell them they HAVE to abort?  If the family can choose to keep a defective child and raise them in a loving and nurtured environment, how is that inherently worse than a welfare mom with more kids than she wanted faced with yet another she can’t handle?  If the birth will devastate the lives of others, impoverishing the quality of their lives, I see that as just as bad as being defective.  A miserable existence is a miserable existence.  Handicapped kids and adults are indeed loving and wonderful people.  Their needs are insanely high and I don’t think I am such a good person I could face the rest of my life caring for a 6 foot tall infant.  I worked in ARC centers and know, they are loving, and frustrating, and an incredible drain on their parents, emotionally, physically and financially.  It really takes a special and dedicated person to face that for a lifetime.  I could only do it for a few hours a day a few times a week.  They face it 24x7.  I applaud their strength and understand anyone faced with it that knows their limits and chooses responsibly not to take it on.  I have also seen those who cannot handle it, and their consequences.<br>
<br>
Every president since Reagan has signed another bill into law making 3rd trimester abortions less and less possible for any reason.  The argument that you want them controlled falls flat because they are already too strictly controlled.  Even in the cases of rape or incest or severe birth defects, the lines are drawn against arbitrary political scratches in the sand, as evidenced by the testimony of Double Latte.  Even when it is warranted, it is almost impossible to do, and they make it harder and more painful on the mother.  Causing more suffering is not the right of the legislature, nor the ‘free speech’ of the protestor’s outside a clinic.  No one enters into it lightly, and the ones who do would still find a way.<br>

2. Adoption, we did fertility treatments for 5 years and had made the decision that if we tried unsuccessfully for 6 years we would then adopt, imagine of all things a child of ethnic heritage or a child with special needs.  YEP that was our plan.  My aunt and cousin have both adopted after having their own children. One a native american child and the other a crack baby, who lived to be 3.  So I think on that point our money is where our mouth is.<br>
<br>
3.  Point taken on the need to &quot;prove rape&quot;  I think our judicial system already puts raped women on trial.  So I am rethinking my position on that (- a little)<br>
<br>
4. No I did not just ignore the discussion on rape, because it actually does fit in with our beliefs.  And having a sister who was date-raped I completely empathize with the pain and trauma that was experienced.  She did not get pg thank heavens but she also did not press charges because of threats of violence and the fear that no one would believe her.  My parents and I didnt even know until several years later.<br>

And so are many parasites. Please don't jump all over me for using this analogy, but it addresses this scientific fact. An organism living inside your body with separate DNA is not recognized by the two sides in the same way with the same rights and that--is the crux of the disagreement and debate.<br>

&quot;pregnancy is a DERANGEMENT of the body.&quot;<br>
<br>
she didnt say this to be offensive, but she is totally right (we were discussing a really bizarre and PAINFUL skin condition that i am dealing with at the moment, that is being caused by the derangement).  and further to the point, women, or any person ever, should not be forced, or forced to accept certain 'consequences' that would lead to the derangement of said persons body temporarily or rest of their life for that matter.  and for the record, i do not believe that a fetus is a separate entity at all.  once it breathes its first breath and survival instincts kick in, then it becomes a separate entity, imo. <p>&quot;i think the good book is missing some pages&quot;<br>

<br>
But it amuses me that Vegans and animal activist are often pro - choice.  Its not ok to kill and eat the cows or chickens, but its ok to rip apart/kill a fetus that may have thoughts and feelings like any other full term baby.<br>
<br>
As far as the distinction goes, I am anti-abortion in most situations (see above), but I have a harder time with abortions that take place after the fetus has formed its own systems.  I also think that many girls who seek abortion are not given enough information about the development of the fetus.  It is dehumanized to a lump of cells which after a very short time is NOT true.  Here in Utah, a girl/woman who wants to have an abortion is required to recieve information about the stages of development, including pictures.  I applaud that.  I havent talked to many woman who have been completely at peace with their decision to have an abortion.  Most that I have talked to have regrets.  <br>
<br>
I think one way to avoid that is make sure that they get educated.<br>
<br>
Raz. - I know that my kids had thoughts and feelings prior to being born.  Its not a light switch.  Why is it OK to extingusih that life prior to birth and then at one second after birth it is murder.

And I believe it is. <br>
<br>
You can not have a law that makes exceptions like rape incest or other such thing. How would a woman prove it was incest? How humilating. And rape. . . Its hard enough knowing that others might not believe you were violated in the most basic and horrific way, and already there is the thought that you are dirty and unclean and those thoughts stay with you for such a long time. But can you imagine, if you were denied the abortion because you can't prove it having that constant growing reminder inside of you? You would NEVER be able to escape that rape for the next 9 months. Every time you couldn't even roll over in bed, or have to pee every ten minutes, its a reminder of what some sick bastard did to you. It makes me sick to think about. Its also one of the reasons I have trouble with that florida law. To me just one person going through that is too much.<br>
<br>
And would that person even take care of themselves during those 9 months? Self-loathing after being raped is common. That can bring on some self-destructive behaviors. Its an effort to take good care of yourself even when you want the pregnancy. But I can't see what the motivation would be if it was brought on by rape. So prenatal care would be poor. AND that is something else to consider. The costs of having a baby. Pregnancy is not cheap in anyway. <br>
<br>
I know you say you believe in abortion for rape. BUT if you attempt to limit abortions to those who can some way prove rape, you would be condemning people such as myself who could not prove it. I have a history of depression, I do not know if I could have handled that. I don't think I could. And family would want to know who the father is... my father would probably have been tempted to go out hunting for the bastard. And then there would be the judging of people who would assume I was easy and loose because I wasn't married. Or stupid (which I was). <br>
<br>
You can't arbituarily decide who could and can't have abortions because it would always leave someone who needs it for their very sanity on the other side. And FORCING her to carry a child brought on by rape would be like raping her over and over and over for the next 9 months. And beyond because it can take months for your body to recover from childbearing and birth. Only this time it isn't just one man doing it to her. But the whole country. <br>

It is a spiritual thing for me in that I think the time and place of our creation has a huge impact of each of us.  To just throw that creative power around with no thought to the consequences is at best irresponsible.  It is also a spiritual thing because I do see life as beginning before the first breath.  And I guess this is why this debate goes around and around.<br>
<br>
When we choose to have sex and create a new life, we have a responsibilty to that life to see that it gets the best it can.  I think abortion is truly a product of the ME generation.  No sense of responsibilty or willingness to accept the consequences of our behaviors.  Its all about what is convenient.  --- Shirene <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mightyk>MightyK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/11/03 3:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Kim</span><hr size=1> I know you agreed about the rape, it was just, I guess I wanted to stress that you can't legistlate it for those reasons alone (IMO) even though you find the reasoning behind others using abortion to be lacking. <br>
<br>
There are plenty of reasons why people become irresponsible. Some are just plain stupid. Do we really want just plain stupid people having more children? Cruel yeah but frankly I'm tired of hearing about children dying in cars because of the mothers stupidity. Or being left abandoned in trashcans. Left alone because the mother is too young to be responsible. Left addicted to crack because the mother couldn't give it up. <br>
<br>
After my rape I was irresponsible. I went through a time where I just stopped saying no. Hell someone already didn't listen and held me down and took it any way. I didn't ever want to go through that again, so I stopped saying no. Sure condoms were always used, being a willing participant I could at least assure that. But condoms can break. I wasn't in my right mind during that time. I know alot of people who have acted like that for my reasons, and for other reasons. I don't know if pregnancy would have snapped me out of that, or just snapped me. I didn't even think of pregnancy at that point. I was so numb.<br>
<br>
I am just trying to say that its not just people thinking, &quot;oh well if I get pregnant I can always abort&quot;. Teens are especially bad at not thinking about the consequences of sex. Shit, teens are good about not thinking of the consequences of anything. They think they can fly and they can't. <br>
<br>
But I also don't think it matters what we think. We can never be in their shoes and understand. Maybe it is selfish... but perhaps by being selfish they are saving a child a miserible life, or birth defects because the woman would be selfish during pregnancy and contoinue bad habits.<br>

I (mostly) with this statement.<br>
<br>
If the parasite (I know, I know, some people don't like the term..but it was my midwife who first used it with me..and I think the term is very fitting) can survive on its own, then it is viable, and should be considered a &quot;person&quot;...again, I'm not sure what the law is in USA, but here you couldn't get a non-medical abortion at that stage..no way, no how (except maybe illegally).<br>
<br>
I think it all boils down to pro-choice people having enough respect for the diversity of lives around us, that we do not feel the need/want or right to force certain moral judgements onto those lives...what is right for you, isn't necessarily right for me - and vice versa. <br>

It is a personal choice and decision, but I dont feel that it should be an option for birth control either. I agree that once it is reached 24 weeks and can live, then abortion shouldnt be allowed, unless there is a case like what DL had to go through.

  I know in my state you can have an abortion up to 14 weeks.My best friends daughter just had a baby at 25 weeks and 2 days. She tried to have an abortion at 13 weeks, but when she was on the table, they doc said she moved a little and they stopped the procedure. My friend is very xian and said it was god that stopped it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Anyway, she went into labor at 23 weeks and they were able to hold her off for 2 weeks. The baby was born 4 days ago and they are already thinking about taking him of the respirator because they think he will be able to breathe on his own. So far no problems that they can detect, just that he needs more time to grow. I believe in the first few weeks after conception, when it is just a mass of cells,(blastocysts), that it is NOT a viable life until it can survive on it own. I am big advocate for embryotic stem cell research and feel that, yes the cells have the potential for life in the early stages, but there are many contributing factors, that all have to be in order, for that to happen.   <p>Karen<br>

Mormongirl, you are entitled to your beliefs. If you feel abortion is wrong, don't have one. Try to influence your sister or friend not to have one, for that matter. But don't try to legislate your spiritual beliefs - because you don't know what's best for the rest of us.<br>
<br>
I've noticed that it's very easy to be pro-life, right up until you actually need an abortion yourself. And don't kid yourself that it'll never happen to you, because that's exactly what I used to think. Married, using birth control, and so on. Why would I ever need an abortion? But you know what, when I did need one those rights were available to me. And IF 2nd trimester abortion had been outlawed in my state, it wouldn't have been available to me. And my baby would have suffered. Because believe me, as reasonable as my abortion was, their are pro-lifers all over the place who condemn my choice because they belief ANY life, no matter how painful or compromised, ANY child, no matter how disabled, must be born because they believe it's &quot;God's Will.&quot;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I agree we should take this gift of procreation seriously and not throw it around. But as I have asked many times on this thread, and not ONE pro-lifer has bothered to answer, WHY is pregnancy an appropriate punishment for sex, and HOW do you also punish the man who is every bit as &quot;guilty&quot; of procreating? Answer this for me or hang it up, please.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think abortion is truly a product of the ME generation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do your homework Shirene, abortion has always been around. It just ended up in a lot more dead women before it was legalized and made safe. Women have always been desperate to get out of crisis pregnancies, and they will still be desperate to do so even when it's illegal.<br>

It is a slap in the face to every mother everywhere to call pregnancy and motherhood &quot;inconvenient.&quot; Your body is hijacked for 9 months, your health and life are in peril, your career or education are on hold, you have to go through labor or major abdominal surgery, and then you become a body servant for 18 years... <br>
<br>
There is no reason to go through all this sacrifice other than LOVE. It is cruel both to women and the children they bear to force them through it for ANY other reason - and especially for the sake religious beliefs they don't even SHARE!  <br>

And because pregnancy is so obvious, everyone would know. So abortion is also about sexual privacy. It's too bad, but it's the truth. Work to change these attitudes and you'll have done something REAL to prevent abortion.<br>

3.  I dont feel that legislating morality is a good idea.  I am not for all the strict alcohol laws that some small (and some not so small) Utah Communities have.  But in the situation of abortion, you have introduced another life. Your right to punch ends at my nose.  The right to do whatever you want with &quot;your&quot; body should not include causing the death of another human life.  <br>
And since no one seems to agree when that life begins this will be an unending debate<br>

4.  I know that abortion occured long before the 60's, I should have stated that the increase and popularity of aobrtion is a result of the Me decades.<br>

5.  I do not hold any personal judgement on the ladies here that have had an abortion.  I actually feel quite sorry that at some point in time things were so awful that they felt they had no other choice.<br>

6.  I don't anticipate the laws changing anytime soon, so my hope would be to increase education on sexuality, increase education on the development of the fetus, increase help and support for PG teens,  Believe it or not I am a social worker, I work on the other end of the age scale - geriatrics, families with dementia etc., but I am a compassionate person who wants help.  <br>

I actually agree with you on a few points such as increasing sex ed and providing better support for pregnancy. After my experience, I came to the conclusion that abortion is a miscarriage of hope. You can't continue a pregnancy without hope, and that is why making abortion illegal will only drive it underground and endanger the lives of our sisters and daughters. <br>
<br>
There are ways to reduce the abortion rate without making it illegal. In Sweden, abortion is legal but rates are extremely low because they are so good about educating their youth and making it easy to get birth control. I'm all for that approach. That's why I'm bewildered by anti-abortionists who are also against birth control and sex ed. (Not saying you are one of those - you seem much more reasonable than that.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
I enjoyed this debate. Although I'm sure we'll never agree, I appreciate your willingness to express your views and listen to mine. It helped me solidify a lot of my thoughts on the issue. I know I got hot under the collar a couple of times and I want you to know it wasn't personal. I am just passionate about this issue and how it affects women's rights and equality.<br>
