<br>
what i read was published by a guy i never heard of before named keith pickering. <br>
( bio: Keith Pickering is a computer systems consultant and historian living in Watertown, Minnesota. He has been researching Columbus and his voyages since 1991, and has during that time authored two papers on Columbus's navigation that have appeared in scholarly journals. He has also given a number of lectures on Columbus's navigation and the log of his first voyage to the Society for the History of Discoveries, of which he is also a member.)<br>
<br>
here is what he wrote:<br>
==========<br>
<br>
At two hours before midnight on October 11, Columbus saw a dim light &quot;like a little wax candle, rising and falling.&quot; He mentioned this to at least two others aboard the Santa Maria, Pero Guiterrez and Rodrigo Sanchez de Segovia. Guiterrez also saw the light, but Sanchez did not. The light was seen once or twice more, but then was not seen again. According to later testimony in a lawsuit, the light was also seen aboard the Pinta at about the same time.<br>
<br>
The actual landfall island was seen four hours later (at 2 a.m. on the 12th) at a distance of 2 leagues. The fleet was travelling 12 miles per hour that night (8 knots in modern terms), so they must have been between 32 and 37 nautical miles east of the landfall island when the light was seen.<br>
<br>
The problem here is that you can't see a low Bahamian island from these distances. Morison suggested that Columbus's eyes were playing tricks on him, which sounds reasonable until we recall that the light was seen by at least three people on two different ships.<br>
<br>
In 1959, Ruth Wolper organized an experiment in which she set a giant bonfire at High Cay (an islet off the coast of Watlings) and sailed east from the island until the bonfire's light was no longer visible. The last glimmer was lost at a distance of 29 nautical miles, significantly short of the requirement (although that did not deter Wolper from claiming success in her experiment). Wolper was able to see as far as she did only because of the phenomenon known as &quot;looming&quot;: when a very bright light illuminates the air above, the air itself becomes visible even when the light source is below the horizon. It is unlikely in any case that the natives would have made a bonfire this large; and even if they had, it would have become more visible as the fleet approached, while Columbus lost sight of the light almost immediately.<br>
<br>
Josiah Marvel, an advocate of the Grand Turk theory, proposed that the light was caused by bioluminescent protozoa on the rocks of Mouchior Bank (located east of Grand Turk).  But the light Columbus described -- like a little wax candle -- strongly suggests a point source. This would rule out both bioluminescence and looming effects.<br>
<br>
Of course, some proposed landfalls have other islands to the east, which would have been bypassed in the night -- but which could provide a source for the light in the form of an Indian campfire or other habitation?<br>
<br>
==========<br>
<br>
in light of this new evidence it only strengthens my own previous opinion based mostly on feeling with what i consider fact.<br>
<br>
(believe me my intentions were to put this matter to rest but it only strengthened my drive not to close the door on the unexplainable) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dag@religiousdebate60574>dag</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/5/03 6:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: the light of october 11</span><hr size=1> i forgot to mention ... still searching ... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=encyclogirl1>Encyclogirl1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/5/03 6:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: the light of october 11</span><hr size=1> And your point is.............<br>

<br>
How about finding some books on debate theory, or some books on what reason/logic/scientific method  constitute?<br>
<br>
I am asking, in all sincerity, that you do that, because otherwise, you will have a hard time debating on this board, if you don't understand the difference, if you don't understand how the terms work. It confuses your audience, and it loses the impact of any point you try to make when you interchange non-interchangeable points.<br>
<br>
Reason and faith are not the same. They are two points on different charts. They are used to measure different things. Your feelings, someone else's feelings, have nothing to do with reason.<br>
<br>
Feelings can be important. However, they are a different measure of the world than reason is, for the main reason that they cannot be experienced the same way by everyone.<br>
<br>
If feelings were an accurate barometer of truth, why isn't everyone on the planet the same religion? Why don't people all find the same type of person attractive? I could go on for days to illustrate the difference.<br>
<br>
It all goes back to the right tools for the job. And in this instance, your feelings on an episode that happened 500+ years ago are your feelings, and your feelings only. Not a point on the trip to reason.<br>
<br>

i'll be the first to agree with you that i have any formal debate training.  should we post a checklist of prerequisites?  maybe i'm just here to teach you and mamag patience.  DBC seems to keep it cool and i learn alot from his posts.<br>
<br>
feelings are an accuate barometer of truth for me.  i don't expect you to accept my truth.  truth can seem different depending upon where you are standing in the room at the time of observation (the tabletop is square, the tabletop is a parallelagram, the tabletop is a line)  does this make truth relative?  nope the tabletop is what it is no matter how many contradicting observations are made.<br>
<br>
maybe the scale analogy was a little off base but what about one made up of spheres.  if all truth fits inside a bubble then truth that is possible to feel is the same sized bubble and truth that has already been proven fits inside a smaller bubble.<br>
<br>
i do not choose to confine myself to the bounds of that smaller bubble. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/5/03 9:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Pickering's Lecture on Columbus as less than truthful...</span><hr size=1> From the lecture <br>
“Indeed, the ten-hour longitude is so clearly at odds with reality that it, at least, has been viewed suspiciously for decades[18]. But why would Columbus falsify such a result? A critical clue can be found in Columbus's Book of Privileges. Prior to both his second and third voyages, Columbus requested that the Spanish Sovereigns confirm his appointments as Admiral of the Ocean Sea and Viceroy of the newly discovered lands. The documents confirming these privileges confine the Admiral's realm only to &quot;the Ocean Sea in the region of the Indies&quot;[19]. Therefore, if the newly discovered lands were not really in the region of the Indies - that is, in Asia - Columbus's entire fortune may have been at risk. Indeed it may have been just such a thought that led the Admiral to demand that the crew of his second voyage sign a document swearing that Cuba was the mainland of Asia[2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ... Since he needed the Ocean Sea to be nine hours wide, he simply claimed it as a fact, and then added in the part about the eclipse to give his statements a figleaf of scientific respectability…But even if this is true, what about the other reported longitudes from the same eclipse? Where did they come from? And why are they less than nine hours? Such differences are commonly seen in cases of fraud. When a story is true, it is drawn from a real memory of actual events; but when a story is fabricated, the fabrication often changes over time, as the hoaxer seeks to make his story ever more unimpeachable. Ironically, these very changes are one of the best ways to detect a hoax.”<br>
You see, as I said Columbus was vain and….well a bit greedy and Pickering suggests throughout this lecture asserting Columbus falsified documents that he did so to gain wealth.<br>
Pickerine ends “As satisfying as it may be to kill six birds with one stone, perhaps more important is what we learn about Columbus the man. For Columbus, his theory about the size and contents of the Ocean Sea was more important than any evidence that might cast doubt on that theory. Truth for Columbus was not to be found so much in observation or experiment, as it was in the voice of ancient and authoritative texts from which there could be no appeal. Living in an age before the scientific revolution, this attitude is understandable even if the outcome is not completely forgivable.<br>
Those who have studied Columbus closely will not be surprised that he was capable of deception when the occasion arose, for this is not the first such instance recorded or suggested. But those who have viewed Columbus as a leader in the scientific thinking of his day would do well to re-evaluate his reliability as an objective observer.”<br>
I confess to be unfamiliar with Pickering's work, background, bias or methods so would never cut and past, lest you used him first. Odd that this first material of his I should find should go against your point. I don't doubt there was a light and that there are logical explanations for these. I highly doubt Columbus took it to be the HF guiding him to a promised land--but then there are many historical instances of lights in the sky. Perhaps it was an alien craft guiding famous navigator? Why jump to the conclusion a god is involved? What evidence is there of that rather than aliens?<br>
<br>
So you see, by your own resource your point is neither made nor your position solidified.<br>

(I have been following this discussion since the beginning, but have not said anything)<br>
<br>
Everyone has feelings about what they believe. Some feelings are fact, some feelings are theories and others are just feelings with no basis other than they make perfect sense and you cannot imagin how others cannot see what you see. I have a feeling that fits into #3. I believe that everyone contains an energy (or spirit if you will) that leaves our body when we die and traveles interdimentionally until (or if) it decides to be reborn into another physical form (sortof like reincarnation with a twist). Is this <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fact</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that this happens? Nope. Do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> believe that it does? Sure. It is my belief. Who knows. Maybe some day, people will find evidence to support it and maybe evidence will be found to disprove it. Either way, I will accept the findings as scientific truth.<br>
<br>
I think that is what is hard for many people to accept with their beliefs in a diety is that there is some &quot;evidence&quot; (ie miracles or the seemingly unexplainable) that points to the existance of said diety. I have given this example to my dd when she starts asking questions: <br>
<br>
&quot;When you look at the night sky, you see stars, right? You know that the stars are really planets and burning fireballs that are millions of miles away. Right? Well, long ago, people did not have the knowledge or equipment to know this. They would come up with reasonable explanations to answer their questions. Some thought the stars were pin holes into heaven and others thought they were &quot;grains of sand stuck up in that big bluish black thing&quot; (Thanks to the lion king<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). They had no comprehension that it could be anything else and their reasons made perfect sense to them.&quot;<br>
<br>
IMO, people have created G-d to be an explaination for the unexplainable. The belief in G-d answers questions like &quot;How can life (an entire being) be created from two individual cells?&quot; or &quot;How can some people survive pancreatic (sp) cancer (only 5 in the US that I know of) when most people die?&quot; Must be a miracle... right? Now, being an agnostic, I really cannot prove that there is not a G-d and he doesn't have a hand in any of these miracles. If there is a G-d, he may. My point is that I cannot prove it either way. <br>
<br>
ok... I think I have digressed. Sorry if I have. *sigh* I am so ready to have this baby!! *wah*<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Two hours past midnight on the morning of October 12 a lookout named Rodrigo de Triana (sometimes called Juan Rodríguez Bermejo) on the Pinta cried out “Tierra! Tierra!” (“Land! Land!”). A reward of a pension of 10,000 maravedis per year (an able seaman could earn about 12,000 maravedis per year) was to go to he who saw land first. Rather cruelly, Columbus pocketed the money himself, claiming that he had seen several lights the night before.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

More probable is that Columbus lied to pocket the money himself.  Two bad you didn't mention the reason for the lawsuit.  I always love how things are left out and twisted to fit one's beliefs.<br>

This is self contradictory.  You state initially that feelings are an accurate measure of something other than your emotions (which is all a feeling can do, feel) and then point out that relative feelings among observers are disparate, concluding that truth is absolute and objective.  <br>

&quot;Truth can seem different depending on where you stand...&quot;  <br>
I say to you it cannot.  FEELINGS can seem different depending on where you stand, truth remains the same, no matter where you stand.  In the farthest reaches of the universe there will still only be 3 feet to a yard.<br>

Ah, but again, this is feeling vs truth.  You may feel (or regard) it as truth, but that does not make it so.  It remains inaccurate and the act of moving grants you the perspective to evealuate it.  People of faith refuse to move.<br>

You have now officially exhausted my patience with this.  It has descended into baiting the bears, or swine as you so inelegantly referred to us.  DAG has the source, the wellspring of all truth and we poor shuffling idiots must strive in vain at discovering what his heart has revealed.  10,000 years of intellect and inquiry, the legacy of our entire species, all of our smartest people ever, pales by comparison to what his 4 chambered blood pump rhythmicly relays to DAG.<br>
<br>
The universe is an amazing place and we get to live at one of the most exciting times for our species in it.  The odds of us even existing are astronomical, and yet here we are.  How lucky is that?  The elegance and glory of our universe is astonishing.  You cheapen it with the flippant manner you condescendingly shrug off our fantastic acomplishments in our brief span.  I wash my hands.<br>

No I did not.  Reality exists.  It is an objective reality.  We view it subjectively.  That reality will continue to exist independantly no matter what we believe or if we ever prove any of it.  Truth cannot be felt.  Feelings are felt.  Emotions are felt.  Sensations are felt.  None of this relates to fact.  Facts by virtue of being truth can be tested and proven to be facts.  I made an analogy that 150,000,000 people bought lottery tickets, and one got to be a winner.  You can have 150,000,000 feelings, one may ACCIDENTALLY endorse a fact, that does not make it a proof for that fact.  It just means you had a lucky guess, just like the jerk who won my money 2 weeks ago.  Heck, every one could endorse a fact, that still doesn't make it an accurate test, it only makes you one lucky guesser.<br>
<br>
Truth can be proven.  We do not currently (as someone already pointed out) have the ability to prove everything, but our knowledge and ability improves every day.  <br>

<br>
They are two different things. You'e trying to find the halfway point of my height by measuring someone else. Does that make sense? Even a little?<br>
<br>
Faith and reason do not evaluate the same types of things. Because of this, there is no middle ground. When things of faith would be proven, then they would stand up to the scrutiny of the scientific process, and would no longer be faith. Again, there would be no middle ground. How you feel about something has no bearing on its reality, in the realm of reason. In the realm of faith, it's a different story. <br>
<br>
Did you read Elizabeths's post? She laid it quite well- how you can feel one way about something, but it matters not one whit in the evidence of it.<br>
<br>
Please read the Sagan book? Pretty please? I promise, you'll understand science better after you do- and you'll understand the limitations that science has, and the limitations of faith. The right tools for the job. That's what it's all about.<br>
