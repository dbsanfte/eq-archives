This is just in my opinion, but since all the big tourneys kicked off this past weekend, I thought it would be good to get some other opinions on this. I have played in Rogers, Kansas City, Hutch, etc. and I have never received what I have recieved down here when my team won a tourney. I have had the pleasure of winning a couple of NIT's last year w/ with the now disbanned Muck Dawgs and never seen anything like softball in south texas. Starting in March you can find a tourney every other weekend that offers either money or bats and most of the time both mixed in with some other prizes as well. I played with a team this past weekend in a tourney that had about twenty teams or so. We got hot and ended up winning the tourney sometime Sunday night. For first we got brand new 12 Miken Velocities, 12 Miken pullovers, 12 Miken hats, and uniform shirts. Noting that these bats are pieces of sh!t(my opinion again) but second got four bats and all 12 pullovers. Lats year, my wife and I played in a coed tourney that had only eight teams in it. We took second and they gave us six red worths to the team mixed in with team uniforms(new shirts and hats). This is for an eight team tourney! I would love it if someone could do a couple of tourneys a year like this in Oklahoma.(St.Pats, Memorial Day, Fourth of July just to name a few holidays these tourney could be on) I think it would create a lot of good things for a sport that has kind of been stagnate the last couple of years. Just something to throw out there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=22mariner>22Mariner</A></span><br> Posts: 52<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/10/04 12:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=879.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just something to talk about on a rainy day in h-town...</span><hr size=1> I agree with you completly. It seems that if you want to win anything besides a t-shirt you have to travel to do so. I think if oklahoma facilities would offer pull overs or even sweat shirts they would bring in more teams. I think last year we won around 20 shirts, and I bet at least 10 of them were the same colors with different designs. thats pathetic!!  Thats why we cant get teams to come to oklahoma and play. So you end up playing the same people over and over again or spend money and play out of state. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C0D9D9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heritage17>heritage17</A></span><br> Posts: 14<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/10/04 12:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=879.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just something to talk about on a rainy day in h-town...</span><hr size=1> Mariner I am surpised enough tourneys made for you guys to win 20 shirts last year around here..lol  <p>Steven Mccarty<br>

Some of our facilities have been wore down or there are old, but we have about six different parks to chose from. We also don't have uniform rules even for tourneys. No matching shirts or numbers. Heck, We played against someone in a tank top on Sat. We have open bat tourneys where you can swing any illegal piece of crap you can dig out of the garage. This past weekend was what they call an Ironman tourney where if you are on field #1 you play there until you lose. Then you go back to the last field, in this case it was #4 and win your way back around to field one. It started Saturday at Noon and lasted till Sunday at six. The team with the most wins on field one won the tourney. I think we played something like sixteen games Sat. and Sun. when it was all said and done. So you get your swings in and on top of all that NO FROZEN FIELDS! Just a little rain this past weekend. The bad thing is that the gate for the weekend was three dollars for the day or five for a weekend pass. This is where they make their money and the tourney was a bit more expensive ($225 + 12 dollar ump fees a game), but it was worth it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#C0D9D9><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/boklahomasoftball.showUserPublicProfile?gid=22mariner>22Mariner</A></span><br> Posts: 59<br> <font color=#8B0000>(2/10/04 5:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/foklahomasoftballfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=879.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: It is not all good, but even those parks try something  </span><hr size=1> Its always worth it when you win.
