Gabriel looked at her.  He could see a slight bit of jealousy in her face, and catch a hint of it in her voice.  He smiled and walked over to her.  &quot;I thought she might be a good addition to our small group.&quot;  He put his arms around her and smiled &quot;You have nothing to worry about.&quot;<br>

He looked out the window with her. &quot;Now back to this, people will be scurring about soon.  Their minds will be scattered and they won't notice if people go missing... for a time.

She fingered the butterfly, on the table she had picked up as we walked in, and grinned, soon, they would have a companion, and then they would have to leave Simulation City, maybe go to the outer limits, but no, they would be too noticed here. <br>
&quot;We will have to leave as soon as they were in full vampire mode.&quot;<br>
&quot;I know, for now, we would, but then we could come back.&quot; She nodded, and looked at him.<br>

Maybe they could get somebody important, and leave them for all to see, for all to see that normals weren't safe.  But then they would be hunted down.  It might take them a while, but they would be hunted none the less.<br>

<br>
He quickly bit the underside of his wrist and put it to her mouth.  She was reluctant at first.  &quot;Drink it...&quot;  He said to her.  He could see her head slowly turn away.  Her took it and moved it back to the cut. &quot;Drink it!&quot; He said, in a sterner voice.  She obeyed this time, drinking the blood from his very veigns.<br>

She was dying at the moment, he got to her just in time. Cassandra sat down on a long couch next to her. When she wakes up, she'll be hungry.<br>

Cynthia licked her lips that, was so pure, and strong, whatever it was. She felt something inside of her start, doing something. Suddenly sharp pains appeared in every part of her body. She gasped, and started breathing hard. What was going on...she, felt so...torn. It was like her whole body was tearing itself apart.

Cynthia looked to the man, and smiled. She walked towards him, and he looked up at her. <br>
&quot;Bonjour Madam, did you have a good sleep?&quot; He smiled genuinely. She nodded, and sat down on a seat as he finished up lunch.<br>
<br>
Cassandra looked to Gabriel, and said very softly, so only Gabriel could hear.<br>
&quot;It is such a shame to lose another cook, and Pierre was so sweet.&quot; Gabriel nodded, and looked back to Cynthia, who was staring at the cook.<br>
<br>
Cynthia watched him work, and quickly realized she was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> hungry for food. It was something else entirely that she craved at the moment. She walked behind the cook, and noticed a vein just under the skin, she could see the blood traveling inside it, and she got a slight cramp in her stomach. She needed something...She knew what she needed. She smiled, and tapped him on the shoulder. He looked to her.<br>
&quot;Yes madam?&quot; He smiled. She smiled too, and then lowered her fangs. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:verdana;font-size:large;">&quot;In the end is my beginning&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
