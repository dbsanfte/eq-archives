</span></div> 		<div id="personalbio"><span class="title">Personal Bio ::</span> <span class="value">Sphinx is actually Grecian. Her grandmother is the infamous terrorizer of Thebes. While she stayed close to the ground, completely in contact with humans and asking of her deadly riddles, the others stayed high up on the mountains away from humans. She basically set up the image of the Grecian Sphinxes as evil. After Oedipus answered her riddle, and she committed suicide, no Sphinx was tolerated. Her granddaughter, Sphinx (her real name unknown) lived with the other Sphinxes in the tall cloud covered mountains away from humanity. She was very young and soon became curious of what humans were all about. She was however, forbidden to have contact with humans. Her curiosity was too much to bear and when her parents and no others were looking, she swooped down to the city of Thebes below. Once the citizens caught site of her, they threw spears and shot arrows at her. A projected rock hit her wing and she fell to the ground. Her wing broken, she was left paralyzed. She roared aloud and her parents came to assist her. They yelled at her to run and her mother went with her to insure her protection, but she was soon noticed and tried to protect her daughter from certain doom. She pushed her daughter into the shadows out of site of the angry mob. Her parents made vicious roars, as they soon had to protect themselves. The roars suddenly stopped, and there was cheering. She watched as the crowds in rejoicing lifted up her parents' lifeless bodies. She ran as fast as she could, unnoticed and soon reached the city's limits and sadly padded over to a tree. She sobbed continuously until she fell asleep. When the morning came she found a dark skinned man hovering over her. She hissed and snarled at him but the man cautiously lifted his hand to pet her black covered brow. She sniffed his hand with her button human nose. He picked her up and noticed quickly that her wing was broken.
          "Hmmm Maybe I better take you home with me. They don't seem to like your kind around here", the man smiled gently. He was actually an Egyptian merchant coming to Thebes in hope of trade, but he was more than happy to be able to bring the Sphinx home with him. They traveled across the Mediterranean to Egypt, where Sphinx learned that her kind was revered. The Egyptian merchant mended her wing and she soon became a loyal pet to him. Her Egyptian eye makeup was but on permanently with ink by her master to declare her a true Egyptian. However, Sphinxes live a long time, and he soon grew old and died. She was extremely upset, losing her only friend in the world. She stayed in Egypt for a while, but then decided instead of mourning over her loss, she would explore. She has already explored most of Asia, and chose to return to Africa to its other diverse environments. Now she is the equivilant of a 2-year-old lion, or a 14-year-old human. She is very polite, courteous, and playful to those whom deserve respect, but with someone opposing her righteous ideals she can become a vicious animal. She seeks the Earth for true friendship and love, but she IS a Lone Nomad. She will come alone and leave alone. </span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="mailto:lone11nomad@aol.com">lone11nomad@aol.com</a></span> </div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">AOL - Sphinx in Spirit</span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 										<span class="value">		<dl>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=2682.topic&index=15" title="post" target="_blank">Re: What Is Love?</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm6.showMessage?topicID=2287.topic&index=2" title="post" target="_blank">Re: HAI!Its Aragorn/ViggoDAY!(and any other sexy man/woman!)</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm6" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">General</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=2688.topic&index=9" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Bad Habits</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=2688.topic&index=21" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Bad Habits</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=2691.topic&index=10" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Nicknames#2</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25.showMessage?topicID=2691.topic&index=15" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Nicknames#2</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/fvitanispridefrm25" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Chat & More</a></em></dd>				</dl>				</span>				</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2004 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
