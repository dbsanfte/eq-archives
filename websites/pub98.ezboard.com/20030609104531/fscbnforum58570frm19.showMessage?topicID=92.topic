The water ran. Somewhere faintly there was the sound of pounding. A rhythmic thumping that hiccuped and paused and then began again. Surely it was the beating of her long dead heart. And faintly whispered from that same distant place, came her brother's voice calling her. But that she knew was only in her head, for her brother had no mouth...<br>
She needed to hurt. She ought to feel pain. But Sire Aitas had taken her pain, taken her aches and bruises and replaced them with the greatest monsterousness. Then he had left her, so appalled by the hideousness he had created. Now instead of her body hurting, her heart hurt. With every thumping beat it hurt. She was a monster, the worst of monsters. Beast to the beasts. She should be punished for her foulness, but there was no one to punish her. <br>
She would have to hurt herself. She would be her own punishment. Maybe if she did it well enough, gave herself what she deserved, then the grown ups would not be too harsh when they came for her.<br>
Except she had killed them. Killed them all. There was no one left to punish her. She would punish herself.<br>
The child sat in the corner of the small shower. Water swirled over the tiled floor, all graded to a central drain. Around her lay bits and pieces of dozens of toys. Plush stuffed animals torn to shreds. Parts and limbs and heads strewn as randomly and grusomely as the bodies left by a war. Tattered remnants of stuffing and fur and velvet clogged the drain.<br>
She was perfect. A wax and porcelain doll. Her features could have sold any product, bought any favor. Blonde hair was trimmed back simply from a classic silent film star face. Her mouth was a tiny rose mou, chin delicately pointed, cheeks round and high, brows arched and expressive. Her eyes were wide and startling, vibrant blue and green like beach bottle glass held to sunlite. Even the blood that rimmed her eyes, beading, rolling, falling down flaxen lashes, could not take from her beauty. The only imperfection was the scars. From wrist to elbow she was scarred. But even that peace was not allowed her. Long deep slashes had been transformed to delicate thorned vines, and small puckered burns twisted into buds and blossoms. They lay like nacre and shell inlay on her alabaster skin.<br>
The child sat in the corner, alone, abandoned, betrayed, unwanted. And well she should be, for she was the most monsterous of monsters. She had killed them all.<br>
Water lapped and spread.<br>
Bits of fluff and fur, velveteen and velour, floated about her.<br>
The computer crackled and spat, hissing with electronic indignance, it's screen smashed in.<br>
Blood eddied and swirled, staining toy corpses.<br>
The perfect monsterous child sat in the corner. Diligently and carefully she carved the brands from her failure from her arms. Pieces of glass from the monitor bit cruelly into the pretty fingers of her tiny hands as she cut<br>
and cut<br>
and cut.<br>
Somewhere faintly there was the sound of pounding. A rhythmic thumping that hiccuped and paused and then began again. Surely it was the beating of her long dead heart. And faintly whispered from that same distant place, came her brother's voice calling her. But that she knew was only in her head, for her brother had no mouth...<br>
