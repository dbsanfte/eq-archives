I thought I'd comment on some of the questions over the next couple of weeks and get your thoughts as well. <br>
<br>
&quot;Please&quot; suggest your opinions on these as well. I certianly do NOT know the answers to all these questions and would appreciate any input any of you might have.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;">1. Is it necessary to stop the rod on the backcast while falsecasting to form a good loop on the forward cast ?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> Yes.... Not only is it necessary it is the most critical stop in the system. The back cast sets up the entire cast. The really great casters will false cast over and over untill they have a &quot;perfect&quot; back cast to set up the forward cast. Wind, slack, timing, loop shape, and other factors can cause the back cast to have flaws that will only be magnified by the forward cast.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;">2. How are loops formed ?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> Fly lines have a &quot;taper&quot; which have greater mass towards the rear and less mass towards the front. As the rod pulls the line through the air it gives it energy. When the rod is stopped the fly line carries potential energy in the form of momentum. Since the mass at the rear of the taper is greater than the mass at the front it slowly transfers the energy from front to back ie heavy turns over lighter. The &quot;loop&quot; is formed by the forces of centrifugal force and drag as this energy is released. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;">3. What happens if you don't stop the rod on the forward cast ?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> If the rod is not properly stopped a convex arc is formed and the fly line will not form a forward loop. energy is dispersed in a &quot;wide&quot; area and the loop will have no distance. Depending on the angle usually a line with no stop will land in squiggles on the water.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;">4. How are tailing loops formed ?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> Tailing loops are the result of a concave rod path. It is not a true half circle but more of a sine wave path. The rod is overloaded when power is not evenly applied. This overload can occur anywhere in the loading process. It can result from a back cast that never fully straightens as a result of poor timing. It can be from a rod speed that does not load smoothly. Or, it can be from the caster trying to give that final &quot;punch&quot; to a cast to give it some extra power. Tailing loops will not deliver energy effeciently and will not allow for good distance. More often than not the are the cause of what people refer to as &quot;Wind Knots&quot;. By the way the European test didn't have a question #4 until recently. A bit of casting trivia.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;">5. Is it best to have a beginner false cast many times prior to laying down the fly ?</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> No... I would think it is better to learn a pick up lay down cast first. Joan Wulff actually suggests that a beginner learn to roll cast first. False casting requires several things to be correct before it can be accomplished. Generally I'll work on just making a couple of stops first then move to making false casts.<br>

Now, in prep for your Master's, let me say that I know that you can perform the Belgian cast where the back cast is elliptical(a constant pressure oval with no stop) and execute a great forward cast and that &quot;You&quot; or &quot;I&quot; could false cast this way(the late Hans Gebetsroither had this elliptical backcasting style). Will you agree that if you begin tracking straight forward on your forward casting stroke that you could make an excellent forward cast and therefore the &quot;Stop&quot;on the                          forward/delivery/presentation could be most critical? Ref. Borger, Nat of Fly Casting pgs 146, 147+ Again, I agree with your answer for the Euro Test!!!!! Also, excellent answers on #2 thru #5! During my teachings of the CCI course, I ask the applicants if you they can make a good forward cast if they do not stop the rod in a backcast stop position? They all say &quot;No&quot;. Then I demo an around the world cast where I circle a minumum of 720 degress and then execute a forward cast because I kept constant pressure on the rod tip and the rod was loaded through forward acceleration and a SU&amp;S to presentation!

<br>
You're kidding right? It may take me a lifetime to &quot;truely&quot; learn how to teach. The MOI is a great outline and has terrific explainations. Seriously I have read and re-read and re-read that more than a dozen times. Each time I read it I get more and more out of it. <br>
<br>
One of the things that I think is seriously lacking in the Federation is a listing of &quot;casting terminology&quot;. We need a defined list of words. Things like tracking, bounce, and casting plane, might be better absorbed by casting instructors if the had to learn the term for their CCI.<br>

<br>
I agree about the casting terminology too.  John and I have butted heads several times regarding &quot;creep&quot; and &quot;forward drift&quot;!  We both mean the same thing.  In the early eighties, Wendell Hise used the term &quot;drifting forward from one o'clock&quot; to describe that motion.  By the way John, I find myself now using &quot;creep&quot;.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

CCI's should have a set of defininitons in their teaching curriculums. In previous discussions with Macauley Lord about publishing items within the CCI program, he told me that everything has to go before a committee of the BOG's and that by the time they all agree items change. Maybe we would not like what they come up with!!! As far as &quot;Drift vs Creep&quot;, I teach students and CCI apps both that Drift is the way to entend the casting stroke and that Creep shortens the casting stroke. Drift is an intentional movement while Creep is unintentional. A few years ago I attended a Master's Seminar by Dusty Sprague about his Master's Study Guide and that certification process, during some of his presentation he talked about drift. I noted/noticed that many Instructors only talk about Drift on the Back Cast! I teach my students that when they extend/shoot line into a back cast and then forward cast, they must drift on the forward cast to extend the casting stroke for the next back cast as they will be taking more line behind them. Dusty really liked this and noted that many casters never realize that they can drift forward as well as rearward, that the casting arc has a center point and can be extended on both sides of center with drift. Many CCI's only teach/talk about drift for the back cast.

I'd call an Elephant an Eskimo as long as we could both understand what we were talking about. Right now I get confused when people are talking about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>casting arc</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>stroke length</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Those two things continue to be switched back and forth with each other and the meanings of each are really not too well defined in the first place. That's probably the reason for the confusion. It's clear that you understand the cast extreamly well. We just need to be able to understand each other.<br>

Mike, I really like the idea of purposeful/intended drift (both forward and backward) being positive and unintentional creep being negative.  I have to admit I never thought about good forward drift.<br>

Here is one of the emails I received from Gordon Hill on the subject of casting arc and stroke length. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
 <br>
I thoroughly agree that this term is a misnomer.  If anything, this so-called &quot;casting arc&quot; term is one of the first things I'd love to see the new CBOG committee on nomenclature change.  We're really trying to describe an ANGLE....NOT an arc.  This angle could be expressed AS an angle.....say &quot;THE CASTING ANGLE&quot;......OR  it could be expressed as the chord of an angle (even if subtended by an arc.)<br>
 <br>
The term &quot;arc&quot; might well imply to the early caster, a doming convex path of the rod tip as a desirable achievement.   Bad for teaching.<br>
 <br>
Some modern fly casting thinkers and authors, I suspect, feel uncomfortable with the term &quot;arc&quot;.......but they use it in writing because of long term prior acceptance.<br>
 <br>
Mel Krieger (The Essence of Flycasting...pp 5 -7 ) said, &quot;The V-shaped arc between the rod in the start position and the rod in the stop position is called the CASTING ARC.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Jason Borger (&quot;Nature of Fly Casting......&quot; pp 35 - 37 ) has discussed this using the better part of 3 pages to do so.  While he decries the term and offers alternatives, he ends up using it anyway as he says, &quot;To me, a term like &quot;Rod Inclination Arc&quot;, seems more focused and descriptive, but since Casting Arc is fixed so thoroughly in modern casting nomenclature, Casting Arc it shall be.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I didn't find the term used in any of the books I studied by Joan Wulff, Lefty Kreh, Mac Brown, Don Phillips, Doug Swisher, Carl Richards, Al Kyte, Charles Jardine, Berris Samples, Ed Joworowski, or Bruce Richards. <br>
 <br>
In studying Macauley Lord's &quot;L.L.Bean Fly-Casting Handbook&quot;, I counted 10 references to the casting arc.....but no definition of it.<br>
 <br>
The term does, however, appear occasionally in fishing magazines.<br>
 <br>
Now, I ask; HOW IS IT SO ENTRENCHED IN THE LITERATURE THAT IT CAN NO LONGER BE CHANGED ?<br>
 <br>
                                                                             Gordy<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

 Well that has come to an END<br>
<br>
Question #1 Yes to form a loop we &quot;stop&quot;. We are not spey casting or circle casting we are casting loops. We Stop the rod.<br>
Question # 2 Loops are formed when the speed of the line being pulled has accelerated faster than what is pulling it. <br>
  Line taper has not a thing to do with the loop formation. Line taper has to do with energy dispersal.<br>
 The lighter line has less mass. Less mass less Kinetic Energy.<br>
 Question #3 Think this one out. Not stopping will just drag the line along. Slowing the rod to let the line pass over the tip you can still form a loop it will be bigger and travel toward the ground. Remember to form a loop the line must pass the rod tip, going faster that the tip.<br>
 So just dragging the line does not make cast. Run as fast as you can.<br>
Question  #4 Tailing loops are formed by the dip in the travel of the rod tip from the loading to the stop. This can be as you said improper power application. Or just raising the rod at the end of the cast. Yes the back cast loop not being straight will cause the tail. But is is caused by the uneven drag of the line on the tip of the rod causing the rod tip to dip lower.<br>
Question #5 False Casting is needed to teach 'Muscle Memory'. Repeating the movement is the only way for the Student to learn to STOP the rod Correctly.<br>
<br>
LAST the Casting ARC is measured at the rod Butt just above the hand. It is the Rotation of the rod. You might look at it as a 'sliding angle'. You can not look at the rod tip due to the flex of the rod. <br>
As the STROKE is from the start of the cast to the end of the cast's hand/rod tip travel. <br>
  This rotation might be 20 degrees as from 1:00 o'clock to 11:00 o'clock. Short stroke for short cast. But the Arc will be the same for longer cast. Just not as fast an acceleration.<br>
 Ok I am ready to defend my stand...<br>
