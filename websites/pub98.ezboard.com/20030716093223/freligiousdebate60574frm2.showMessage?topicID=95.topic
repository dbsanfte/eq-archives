I never really bought into this, just another reason I was a lousy Catholic who lost her faith. We were supposed to believe it literally and I couldn't go that far.<br>
<br>
When my neice had her first communion last summer, the priest explained transubstantiation to all of the new little communicants this way: He held up a slice of American cheese, and said that the cheese had calcium in it, even though they couldn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>see</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the calcium, they knew it was there. <br>
<br>
He seemed quite please with this analogy, but I found it flawed. One can scientifcally break down the cheese and prove the calcium is there. Scientfically breaking down the communion host will net you flour and water, not Jesus.<br>
<br>
I thought a better explanation would be that it's like money. A $50 bill is, scientifically, just a piece of sturdy, printed paper with some gobbledegook about &quot;in god we trust&quot; on it. Yet we all agree that it's worth $50, and we can even go down to Meijers and buy $50 worth of socks, or whatever, with it. Therefore, it is indeed provably worth $50 by dint of our agreement that it is so. The minute everyone decides it's not worth that, it's value falls. Likewise, the host &quot;becomes&quot; the body of Christ by dint of all the congregants agreeing that it has that value to them.<br>
<br>
Now, here is a common problem about transubstantiation. A lot of Catholics have a big issue over sugar in the host. In my town, they take out full-page newspaper ads, complaining that transubstantiation CANNOT take place if there is any sweetener, leavening, or other desacratory ingredients in the bread. They are outraged at the Catholic churches in our community that use a home-baked, whole grain bread lightly sweetened with honey, when &quot;everybody knows&quot; the communition host must be a pristine white disk that tastes like wallpaper paste and has a little cross stamped on it.<br>
<br>
It takes such a leap of faith to believe that the communion host literally becomes the body of Christ. It boggles my mind that people can believe this with all their hearts, and at the same time they think that a wee bit of honey in the intended host will result in the Holy Spirit hovering above the alter saying &quot;no way am I entering <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> host, there's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>sugar</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in there!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Or maybe the sugar plants enough doubt that the agreement as to the host's value fails, and it becomes worthless. Like if we'd doubted the value of the new big-face currency it may have flopped.<br>
<br>
What do you think?<br>

<br>
Communion represents the last supper with Christ. Passover is celebrated with unleaven bread. I think it was unleaven because they had to make it in a hurry when leaving Egypt with Moses and didn't have time for it to raise (anyone help me with that? I can't quiet remmeber if this is right or not).<br>
<br>
Anyway, during passover Christ said something along the lines of &quot;This is my body and this is my blood, remember me when you eat and drink&quot; or something along those lines - its spoken out during mass but its been ages since I've last went. <br>
<br>
Sooo, part of the sacrement of Holy Communion is the blessing the the wafer (host). Traditionally it is to be unleaven bread because that is what Christ was holding (when you eat this bread being this type of bread I guess). Its also why communion wine, is WINE and not grape juice. But during the blessing of the host it is suppose to change into the body of christ. I guess its a mystery <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
So obviously you have those who are hide-bound to tradition who feel it MUST be that way. And in a way I can see why they feel that way. After all unleaven bread is what Jesus was suppose to be holding during this little dialogue. But I've never heard how if its not unleaven then it would not transform into the body of christ. The churches I attented all had the little plastic (well that is what it tasted like) wafers.<br>
<br>
Even before I renounced christianity but after I stopped believing in the Catholic Church's teachings I still for a while attended mass. I did not take communion. It was a little scary the first time I didn't go up while visiting my family, I was afraid they would say something. But I couldn't lie about that. I have too much respect for those who do believe to take communion anymore. <br>
<br>
I am not sure if I answered the question or not...but that's what I remember <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
So the fact that it was bread prepared for a meal means no way was it a dinky little flavorless white disc with a cross stamped in it anyway. It was propably more like a whole grain flat bread. I'm thinking pita or focacia.<br>
<br>
The incantation before the transubstatiation is something like &quot;this bread is my body which was given up for you so that sins may be forgiven. This cup is my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting convenent... do this in memory of me.&quot;<br>
<br>
What about the cannibalistic aspects of this statement? Am I the only one who was ever troubled by that?<br>

It cracks me up that people seem to know exactly what JC said. How is this possible? Because it was written down? How many people could read and write in those times? Not many. So how could you ever verify this? <br>
Have you ever played the whisper game? The one were you sit in a circle and whisper into the persons ear a secret and by the time it goes around the circle and comes back to you it is totally different? That is what I think happened to all the stories about JC. <br>

That troubles me also!<br>
<br>
These are the verses in the bible about communion.  You tell me if they sound to you like we are suppose to have a preist pray over it and Jesus becomes the waffer.<br>
<br>
1Cor 11:24<br>
And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,  Take, eat:  this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  After the same manner also he took the cup,  when he had supped , saying,  This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<br>
<br>
Communion is symbolic. The waffer is a picture of his death on the cross.  When we eat it we are remembering what he did for us.  Thats why he says, &quot; do this in rememberance&quot;!<br>
I think its stated pretty simply in scripture.  Where did the catholics get that Jesus is really the waffer? That is just sick to me! <br>

And it got misconstrued. &quot;Think of me when you eat&quot; becomes &quot;eat me.&quot; That's just my take on it.<br>
<br>
Catholics have a lot of funny ideas IMHO. I think of it as dogma piled on top of dogma (or a dogma pile <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). For example, they are supposed to believe that Mary was assumed bodily into heaven. This is not biblical whatsoever. The notion was a result of theologians putting their heads together and deciding, hey, Jesus was a mensch and Mary was his mother. No way would he leave his <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>mother's</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> body down on earth after death. So, Mary <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>must</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have been assumed into heaven because to say otherwise is to say her Son is a schmuck.<br>
<br>
This dogma piling got Mary deified, when in fact there are some bible scholars who argue quite convincingly that she was not even a virgin. But maybe that's a topic for another thread.<br>
<br>
I also think the Catholic religion has become something of a pro-life cult. They make a huge deal about pro-life, which is also not biblical (in the bible, life begins at birth. The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> people God mentions knowing before birth are prophets such as John the Baptist.) But let's not do the abortion debate again, you all know where I stand on that.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

When everyone started having their first communions, I had communion explained to me by several of my Catholic friends. The whole host, this is my body, this is my blood thing. I was very jealous, because my girlfriends got to wear what looked to me like bridal veils, so I felt left out. After the big day, when they had all made Communion, my mom asked me how it went.<br>
<br>
I said &quot;Great- they got to be brides, and Traci got to eat part of Jesus Christ, I think she got a leg&quot;....<br>

I just don't get that whole idea. I didn't then, and I still don't. I think it's gross, and odd, and a weird aspect of Catholicism (even though Dh's family is Catholic). <br>
<br>
However, in the scheme of things, I guess it's not much weirder than praying to Jesus to help you make that touchdown, though....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Ok I'm being a little silly there. But not really. Its how I looked at it as a child and teenager. <br>
<br>
Anyway about the host etc. Maybe this is one of the few times that the Catholic Church took something more literarly then the baptist. <br>

Forgive my spelling tonight. I've had the second worst day of my life, yesterday being the first. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I always imagined Mary struggling to get JC in the tub and him just standing on the water stamping his little feet.  How frustrating would that be for a mom?  Or coming home to empty water vessles scattered all around the house and his teenaged friends just hiccuping and giggling at the 'fresh spring water'.  No wonder he was so popular at parties!  I could have saved a ton if he bartended for my wedding. &quot;No, no.  No booze for me, just another <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>water</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> please.&quot; &lt;wink&gt; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &lt;nudge&gt;<br>

I know she must have been really upset when he started hanging around the hookers and lepers.  All these blind dudes showing up at the house at all hours (not like they knew it was night time!) Let's not forget that first pet rabbit she got him as a kid, ran over it with the cart one day and he resurrected it, then it froze one cold night and he resurrected it, then those dogs got it and he resurrected it.  Damn thing finally got sick of it all when it was 28 years old and ran away just to get him to stop bringing it back. Poor thing.  How bad John must have felt when he learnt his step-son died in a tragic carpentry accident. (oops, too far with that one.)<br>
<br>
Okay, I'll stop.<br>

Is everything subject to the belief phenomenon? How do you get gas in your car? <br>
Simple, believe it is there.....<br>
What am I to do? How is it all of these Believeists, get to have free gas, when im stuck paying $1.93 a gallon?? <br>
