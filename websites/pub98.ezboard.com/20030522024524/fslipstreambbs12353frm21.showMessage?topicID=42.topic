<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SLIPSTREAM UNDERGROUND POLICY</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mod/Admin policies</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Moderator Restrictions</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1. No moderator may warn outside his or her forum. <br>
2. No moderator may delete a thread.<br>
3. No moderator may lock a thread except under the following circumstances:  The board itself is in jeopardy, and/or if the size of the thread is prohibitively large as to effect loading time for members.  Threads will not be closed at the originators request.<br>
4. A moderator may NOT edit or delete a post unless it contains a image that violates ezboard policy, a image that stretches a thread out of shape, contains a members real life information, (ie: phone number, address, credit card number, etc) or by consent of the members of this board. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Moderator Responsibilities</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1. A Moderator is responsible for the forum they moderate.<br>
<br>
2. A Moderator is responsible to the members who frequent their forum.<br>
<br>
3. A Moderator is responsible for moving objectionable posts to the Abyss if the contain outrageous flames, baiting and/or attempts to harm or destroy any other member or the board itself.  However the offending post is not to be deleted, merely removed from the thread and placed in the flaming thread in the Abyss, with an explanation and a link to where the post has been moved to, left in the original post's space in the original thread.<br>
<br>
4. A Moderator is responsible for their own behavior and their own actions.  Any Moderator violating ezboard policy or putting the board or members at risk through their behavior will be removed from their position.  <br>
<br>
(All moderator rules also apply to Administrators with the exception of rule 1.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Administrative Restrictions</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1. No Admin. may ban someone unless all other Admins and Moderators agree by a 2/3 majority - unless someone is an immediate threat to the board (ie: a porn spammer). As soon as the majority of Admins and Moderators are online that ban must be gone over and decided whether or not to be lifted. <br>
<br>
2. No Permabans <br>
<br>
3. All Bans must be listed publicly as they occur (with reason for the ban listed). <br>
<br>
4. No Admin may make changes to the board without consent of the other admins. <br>
<br>
5. All Admins must abide by the decisions of the membership on all issues, unless those decisions violate existing ezboard policy. The admins will make every effort to determine the ‘will of the members’ either by poll or a discussion thread that addresses the issue squarely.<br>
<br>
6.  No Admin may create a secret forum, invisible forum or any forum that members cannot at least view/read.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Administrators Responsibilities</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1. Admins are responsible for the viability of the board and for its expansion.<br>
<br>
2. Admins are responsible for their actions and their decisions.  They can and will be held accountable for behavior that is contrary to the long-term viability of the board and or the health of the membership in general.  <br>
<br>
3. Admins are responsible to the Moderators, community and its members.<br>
<br>
Moderators and Administrators are subject to all the same rules and consequences as the membership. If a ban is warranted in the case of either a Moderator or an Administrator that person will also immediately lose his job on this board.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Flaming, Baiting and Trolling</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1.  A flame is defined as: Personal attacks like name calling, hostile remarks, accusations, etc.) and will not be tolerated. Ideas and opinions may be debated but never an attack on a personal basis. Homosexual, racist and other hate language will be dealt with very quickly and firmly.  A Moderator/Admin will do the following if anyone, including a Moderator or Admin engages in outright flaming:<br>
<br>
a) Move the offending post(s) to the Abyss flaming thread. <br>
b) Leaving an explanation and a link to where the post can be found.<br>
c) Leaving the original thread to continue with its topic.<br>
d) If the thread itself becomes too hot for a forum, it will be moved to the Abyss.<br>
<br>
** NOTE: It is a wish (Though not a demand) that if a member feels the need to flame someone or they think it might go there that they make the challenge and then post a link to the new thread on the subject in the Abyss without having a moderator do it for them. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. Baiting is defined as:  Acting and posting in such a manner as to provoke a member or Moderator/Admin to flame.  This is and will be treated just as harshly as actual flaming.  When an outright baiting post is identified a Moderator/Admin will:<br>
<br>
a)  Move the offending post(s) to the Abyss flaming thread. <br>
b) b) Leaving an explanation and a link to where the post can be found.<br>
c) Leaving the original thread to continue with its topic.<br>
d) If the thread itself becomes too hot for a forum, it will be moved to the Abyss.<br>
<br>
3. Please remember that this site is designed to be FUN, as such, we all need remember to respect each other.  That is not to say that heated discussion cannot occur  or that one must mind every word, obscenity when used as an expression of emotion and not directed at another member is not baiting or flaming necessarily.  <br>
<br>
4. In making any decision regarding Flaming, Baiting or Trolling the criteria for the Moderator/Admin will be the following:<br>
<br>
a) The result, what was the result of the post. What one might have intended will be taken into consideration, but ultimately it will be the result that is used in making a determination.<br>
<br>
5. The only forum that will receive wide latitude in the enforcement of these rules are MA.  The only forum exempt from these rules is the Abyss. (Of course these forums are not exempt from Ezboard restrictions nor are they allowed to post anything illegal.) Members are urged to remember that these forums are for hot topics and can be offensive/heated/emotional.  You enter at your own risk.    <br>
<br>
6.One note on the RP forum and RP factions threads in OD: Concerning the Roleplay area you can take it as far as is appropriate, if that behavior is “In Character”.  <br>
<br>
Some teasing and baiting is fine in Roleplay; it is actually expected.  As long as members stay in character while teasing other ‘in characters’, there will be wide latitude given.  <br>
<br>
Moderators are responsible for being familiar with what is IC and what is OOC.  If the Moderator or a poster has a question, the first action should be to just ask the poster in question, “Is that IC or OOC?”   <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
OK can anyone think of something I missed or any changes in the language?  <br>
<br>
This is now open to discussion…….. ~ Cait <br>

Pretty much all of these should say the Abyss instead of the black hole.<br>
<br>
The black hole is just basically for annoying, repetitive, trolling spam...  Not things that can be discussed.<br>
<br>
The Abyss is all for flaming and baiting.<br>

OK...  slight change here...  I think that along with an explaination in the edited out post of the offender that we should add a link to the new thread in the Abyss so that people can carry on there if they wish and the original thread can carry on unmolested.<br>
<br>
(BTW it is my fondest wish that if a member feels the need to flame someone or they think it might go there that they make the challenge and then post a link to the new thread on the subject in the Abyss without having a moderator do it for them.)  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I would actually like this to include all moderators in this circle as well while we're talking about banning people.  If someone is to be banned I want the entire administration involved if at all possible.<br>
<br>
It is an admin's responsibility to admonish wayward mods and it is the mods responsibility to return that favor when the Admins mess up.  Admins may be forced to ban other Admins if the rest of the council agrees that it is necessary.<br>
<br>
It's like an informal council that includes all admins and mods, the only difference between the Admins and mods is the reponsibilities and the powers...  In all other things they should be equal to everyone else on the board.<br>

<br>
Nothing is too hot for the Abyss unless it becomes illegal.  At that point the post will be edited.  Also I'd like to add the step I mentioned earlier about linking the original thread to the new thread in the Abyss.<br>
<br>
The same goes for the baiting.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1. I like that the mods still have the ability to lock the thread. I never thought that they should, just felt that it helped relieve the admins from having to be all over the place... like they aren't anyway bit you know what I mean.  <br>
<br>
2. I have a question, How long before a thread is moved to the black hole? When is it considered to be time to archive it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2. A Moderator is responsible to the members who frequent their forum.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
3. We may want to define responsible here... even I am not to clear on what is meant here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1. No moderator may warn outside his or her forum.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
4. I am unclear, are we giving warnings or not? I knew sveral people here do not like the idea of warning but if we are warning, then we need to have a list of how many wanrning before banning occurs and so on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2. No Permabans <br>
<br>
3. All Bans must be listed publicly as they occur (with reason for the ban listed).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
5. Ok, since we are not Permabanning, we do need to know for how long someone will be banned for certain things. For example, is it 1 day for first offense, 2 days for second, and so on...<br>
<br>
For now, I think everything else is all good.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You guys have done a fantastic job.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <p>----------<br>

Well, given the climate on the Internet at times, warnings will be given, it's just not going to be like it was before...... Not like a hammer coming down, more like a 'get real' and 'chill'.<br>
<br>
I'm working on the warnings and ban particulars. I'll post them in the rules when I am done. and again seperately in this thread for review....... <br>
<br>
I'll try and clarify 'responsible' in that section........  Thanks for your feedback.....<br>
<br>
Once we are settled in and not in such transition, threads will go to the black hole when they reach the last page.. ezboards have a page limit and before threads fall off in any forum we'll archive them in the Black Hole.. As that filles up we'll probably be in our new home and it won't be a problem.<br>

1. Moderator terms are for 6 months.<br>
2. Moderators will not serve any longer than 6 months at one time in any one forum.<br>
3. If a Moderator chooses to take an assignment in another forum (rotation) for an additional 6 months, that Moderator MUST take a 3 month break from Moderating at the end of the second term.<br>
4. There are NO term limits, but Moderators MUST take the breaks indicated.<br>
5. A Moderator may opt to take a 6 week break from Moderating after the first term, then return to either their original forum or a new forum, whichever is available.<br>
6. New Moderators will be chosen exactly as the original Moderators were: i.e. Admins will ask for volunteers, make a selection and put it before the membership for discussion. New Admins will be chosen from existing Moderators and will be chosen based solely on performance.  The best Moderator will be considered the best choice for Admin.  <br>
7. New Moderators will be assigned as positions become available and/or as the needs of the board indicate.<br>
8. A Moderator CAN only be removed from his/her position for gross violations of Board Policy.  These are voluntary positions that require time and energy; we acknowledge that this is a service the individual chooses to give to the board.  We will not frivolously remove any Moderator.  (Gross violation of Board Policy is defined as action or inaction that puts the board or the membership in jeopardy. <br>
9.  The only Moderator exempt from these rules is the Tech Admin/Moderator.  He will always be Moderating QSF.<br>
<br>
** since all the Moderators and Admins  took their positions at the same time we will stagger the first terms of office so that not everyone is leaving at one time or changing at one time.  Forums with two Moderators will definitely NOT have both rotate out or take a leave at the same time.  I'd like it to be voluntary and I'd like these  first terms to stagger at 6, 7 and 8 months, having one-third leave or rotate at those points.  Sort of like the Senate in the US... ***  So there will be longer terms of service jsut for the Mod's who rotate out at the 7 and 8 month times.  After that though, all terms will be 6 months.<br>

1. There are NO permabans.<br>
2. Bans are for One week or one month.<br>
3. One month bans will be issued for the following offenses:<br>
 <br>
a) Gross spamming  (Gross spamming is defined at posting the exact same text/image (or the same type of text/image) several times in one thread, several threads or forums and having no discernable relationship to the topic of the thread(s). <br>
b) Porn Spamming and/or posting of any porn at all.<br>
c) Posting a booby-trap.<br>
d) Hacking<br>
4. One-week bans will be issued under the following circumstances:<br>
a) If a banned member attempts to post under a dual within the term of the original ban.  One week will be added for each attempt to post.<br>
b) Repeated attempts to post in a thread where the members posts have been removed to the Abyss for flamming, trolling or baiting.  The removal of a post to the Abyss is a hint the member should take seriously.  Repeated attempts to go back to the original thread and disrupt it will garner a one-week ban.  It gets a stiff ban because there is a forum ready made to continue on a tirad.  Take it to the Abyss or take a one week vacation from posting.<br>
5. Bans apply to ALL the user names (duals) of a member.<br>

<br>
1. Warnings are an admonition only and are not cumulative and will not result in a ban except under the specific circumstances indicated in the bans section.  <br>
2. Moderators will use their discretion in stepping into a thread and indicating that there is a problem before removing a post to the Abyss.<br>
3. Since all Flaming, trolling and baiting posts are removed to the Abyss the moving of the offending post <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a warning.<br>
4. Moderators are urged to take steps to cool a situation down, but these are not official warnings.  However they are to be heeded by a member.<br>
5. Any problems with the decision of a Moderator is to be taken to the Moderator's Actions forum for disucssion.<br>
