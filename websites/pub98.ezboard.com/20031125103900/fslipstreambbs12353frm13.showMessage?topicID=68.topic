Authors note- this is in answer to a challenge to reddragoncrp- To continue a story that starts... It began the way all stories that end badly begin, There was this woman/man. Well this is my spin on it. <br>
AN2 I'll post the next part after I get feedback <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;It began the way all stories that end badly begin, There was this man. I was wondering around the local drift and was pulled aside by this ragged, rough looking guy that had an oar about him. He was older, taller, and more adventurous than I was. Plus I knew nothing about him; he was a complete mystery to me. I wanted to know who he was, and what he wanted he had a wonderful charm to him.'<br>
<br>
&quot;You have to get me out of here.&quot; Holding on to my shoulders, he was talking in hush whispers, looking around, like someone was following him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know where you want to go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can fix that...later.&quot; he was charming, sly, he had my complete attention/<br>
<br>
&quot;You want me to take you somewhere, a complete stranger and you expect me to do that why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because, you can trust me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What if I don't have anything to take you in.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You seem to be a resourceful girl, you can do this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What makes you say that. You don't know who I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're right I don't, why don't you tell me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to. You tell me first.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, can you get me out of here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe,&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are definitely something.&quot; I nod, he intrigued me, who ever he was I wanted to know more about him. Probably wasn't one of my better ideas but hey, he was... definitely something and I was young. Anyway.'<br>
<br>
&quot;So where do you want to go?&quot; I ask once we got to a different section of the drift, going through the back corridors and no enter areas.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just away from the main area, and as far from people as possible.&quot; I smiled; we ended up spending the next week together, learning more about each other, without really learning everything about the other. He treated me like I was just another girl. I wasn't different, wasn't not normal. I liked it. Well then everything broke loose; the guards of the station stopped him, and arrested him and me. We fought and broke free stealing a ship, I picked the locks and we took off. I jumped ship at a drift, haven't seen him since, until today.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kylie@slipstreambbs12353>Kylie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#0000ff, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/15/03 5:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/1524694.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How Everything Falls</span><hr size=1> {{{{Alex}}}} YaaaaaaaaaaY!!

<br>
I look over at my two companions, we were sitting in the 'clubhouse' on the Maru, and they were completely entranced with my story. We were sitting in a circle, all holding pillows or blankets; we were having a sleep over after the day’s events.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are sorry he is here, aren’t you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I was just startled, it reminds me of how much things have changed and how much I have grown up. I was so young then, now I would have probably ignored him and told him to go away. And would have missed a lot of fun, learning too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's what happens when you get older, you learn to be more careful, less naive.&quot; I nod, watching as they lean forward, a clear question on both of their faces.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you do when you were with him, that week?&quot; I can't blame them, they are as curious as I was to who he is.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was curious, I wanted to know who he was, what he did. The first day we found one of the drifts gardens, and sat to talk, ended up being there for hours. We talked about everything, family, friends, jobs or lack there of. What we have done and where we've been, where we wanted to go. I found out that...’<br>
<br>
&quot;Where did you grow up?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was raised on a ranch, with two sisters, and a brother.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You liked it there?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It was always so closed off, I always wanted to live in the stars.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You look like you are having a great time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am, it's wide open spaces that are just calling to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you traveled alot?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I tend to move when the time calls for it, make my from place to place. I've been around.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I love space, it's so beautiful, everything is so open and free. People, lots of people.' I learned so much about him and myself that week. More of who I was, and why I wanted to be out here. He was a talker, he would tell you anything, and I wanted to trust him. I wanted to trust everybody. He didn't demand anything, we just stayed by ourselves, would meet in the garden in the morning and walk around the quieter places on a drift. They can be very nice if you stay away from the crowds. I loved drifts, I loved ships. I wanted to do so many things. Most of which I would still like to do. He made me feel as if I could do anything. I was so confused when we were arrested then when we got free and had to get out of there. I just acted, everything was out of my control. I was so upset, hurt. I wouldn't let him explain what happened, why would he want to explain something now, it had been to late. I just locked myself in the sleeping area and got off at the next drift when he went to get supplies. He had asked me if I was going to leave I told him no. He said he would tell me what happened when he got back. That he would explain everything. I didn't want to know, I thought I could trust him, that I could believe him. I didn't wait for him, left before he got back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you ever wonder what could happen if you would have stayed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sometimes, but I think I knew leaving was for the better. That it was the right choice, sometimes your choices are easy, sometimes they are hard. You could have 80 different things that you could do at one moment in time; sometimes it's only two. I think that the choices of this or that are the ones that people have the most trouble with. Because the ones with 80 different answers are usually the simpler one, easy to answer, the ones with 2 leave you to wonder, did I do the right thing?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kylie@slipstreambbs12353>Kylie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#0000ff, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 297<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/20/03 10:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/1524694.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How Everything Falls</span><hr size=1> Aw don't worry 'bout it!

<br>
------------------------<br>
<br>
We all jump as a voice rings out through the Maru,<br>
<br>
&quot;Captain Valentine are you on board?&quot; the loud familiar voice booming through the small ship.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
 &quot;Tyr?&quot; I turn to look at the bewilderment of my companions, one in particular. &quot;What is he doing here?&quot; I watch her clamber over the mass of pillows, blankets and mountain of other things that have been dragged into the clubhouse, disappearing around the bend of the door, their hushed voices to low to make out. She appears back a few seconds later.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are needed on the bridge.&quot; I look down at my clothes; I had not planned on being interrupted. &quot;ASAP.&quot; I nod getting up, watching as she settles down on the floor next to Rommie. Looking over her shoulder to the pile of flexi’s that were brought in, probably holo-novels or the horror novels. I leave having Tyr nod his greeting I step into stride next to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's nice of you to join us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I found her on the Maru with the ship and Beka.&quot; Tyr said as he walked by me, pausing to look me over quickly. &quot;They were ‘talking’.&quot; Dylan smiles at Tyr’s sarcastic tone looking at me with genuine look of amusement before frowning slightly<br>

&quot;Sorry to cut your 'girls night' short but we are having trouble with your new passenger,' I take in the notion that Dylan believes I am the only real reason he is here to begin with, 'I believe that you know him best.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is he doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Complaining, things aren’t to his liking.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He is in medical, he should be comfortable.&quot; Dylan walks up to me stopping next to my shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe you should go see what the problem is.&quot; Harper appears at my side wrapping his arm around my shoulders, smiling brightly at me as he leans closer.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll keep you company my beautiful golden goddess.&quot; I smile at him, holding his gaze. I shake my head softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's all right Harper, this is something I need to do on my own. Tell him I am on my way.&quot; I turn to walk out feeling Harper's arm fall away from my shoulders. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kylie@slipstreambbs12353>Kylie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#0000ff, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wise One</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 306<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/21/03 11:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/1524694.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How Everything Falls</span><hr size=1> Damn.
