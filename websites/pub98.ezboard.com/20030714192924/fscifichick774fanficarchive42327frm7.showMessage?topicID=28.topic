<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
Lex walked into the Talon and spotted Chloe sitting in one of the chairs in a back corner. He grinned. He hadn’t seen much of her since the last Lana zone game they played. She hadn’t even ended up joining them for dinner that night, because her dad called and gave her a guilt trip about not seeing her much lately. But now, Gabe was away at a conference and Chloe was sitting there all alone. Lex ordered his coffee and strolled over to her.<br>
<br>
“May I?” He asked. She looked up at him and he motioned to the chair next to her. He sat down without waiting for her reply.<br>
<br>
“Seeing as how you own the place, I doubt I could stop you,” she said. He arched an eyebrow at her.<br>
<br>
“Bad day?” Lex asked. Her expression softened and she gave him a small smile.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to take it out on you,” she said. He nodded once as an acceptance of her apology.<br>
<br>
“Would a rousing game of Lana zone cheer you up?” He asked. She chuckled morbidly.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think so,” she answered. “I think I need a new game.” She paused and looked thoughtful. “If I ask you a question, will you tell me the truth?” Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t realize this had turned into an interview,” he replied. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
“Not that kind of question,” she said. Chloe took a sip of her coffee and smiled. “If it was a question about you, then I would have expected you to lie.” He feigned hurt.<br>
<br>
“I think I’m insulted,” he said.<br>
<br>
“Don’t be. It was actually a compliment,” she said. He furrowed his brow at her.<br>
<br>
“How can calling me a liar be construed as a compliment exactly?” He asked. She shrugged.<br>
<br>
“You don’t open up your emotional wounds for everybody to dig at, you protect yourself. It’s a survival technique that I have yet to master,” she answered. Lex frowned, but quickly put on a neutral face.<br>
<br>
“What did you want to ask me?”<br>
<br>
“I’m having second thoughts about it now. Forget I said anything,” she said. Chloe brought her coffee up to her mouth and took a long drink so she could avoid talking to him, but he looked at her expectantly, and she knew she wouldn’t be able to get out of having the conversation. “If I ask you, it’s just going to make me look incredibly bitter and resentful, and I’d rather not portray myself in that light if you don’t mind.” Lex couldn’t help but smile.<br>
<br>
“I think I can handle it,” he said honestly. Chloe sighed.<br>
<br>
“Why does every guy in Smallville like Lana? You know, apart from the whole pretty and nice thing,” she said. He leaned forward in his chair and gave her a thoughtful expression.<br>
<br>
“Every guy or just a certain farm boy?” he answered. She frowned and closed her eyes for a second, and then she shook her head.<br>
<br>
“Right now I almost wish it was just Clark,” she said.<br>
<br>
“I’m sure that some of the male population of Smallville hasn’t fallen for the raven haired beauty,” he replied. She gave him a blank expression.<br>
<br>
“And by the way you answered that question, I can tell that obviously isn’t the case,” she said. Chloe started to stand up and Lex touched her arm to stop her.<br>
<br>
“You’re leaving?” He asked. His mind went through a dozen things he could tell her that would make her stay. “We haven’t come up with a new game yet.” She turned and looked at him and he offered a partial smile. She forced a smile onto her face too.<br>
<br>
“Don’t need one,” she announced. “I’ve decided to give up on men and join a convent.” Lex laughed.<br>
<br>
“You’d never make it through the vow of silence,” he joked. Her lips went thin and she glared at him. She wanted so badly to be angry with him, but she just couldn’t. Finally, she just smiled.<br>
<br>
“Maybe they’ll let me skip that one,” she said. Lex smiled and moved his eyes back to the chair she had been in, indicating that she should sit down. He smirked.<br>
<br>
“Somehow I doubt it,” he said. Chloe sat down and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“What do you suggest then?” She asked. Lex raised his eyebrows.<br>
<br>
“You’re asking me for advice?” He asked in surprise. She grinned.<br>
<br>
“I know. That’s one of the signs of the apocalypse isn’t it?” She kidded. Lex nodded and grinned.<br>
<br>
“It very well could be,” he said. “But I’ll be happy to give you advice.” She crossed her arms and smiled at him.<br>
<br>
“Okay,” she said. “What is it?”<br>
<br>
“I think you should give all your attention to a man other than Clark,” he said. She arched an eyebrow. “You don’t have to like him,” he added.<br>
<br>
“You’re joking?” She asked. He shook his head.<br>
<br>
“See it as the new game you wanted. Any time Clark is around, you spend the entire conversation talking about your new paramour, or, if he’s there, doting on him,” Lex said.<br>
<br>
“You want me to try and make Clark jealous?” She asked in disbelief. “Because it won’t work. I think we’ve already established that.”<br>
<br>
“It’s not a matter of making Clark jealous, it’s a matter of putting yourself in a mind set where he’s no longer the first thing you think about.” Lex paused and smiled. “And there’s the added bonus of seeing Clark’s reaction.” Chloe laughed.<br>
<br>
“You’re not going to let me leave here until I agree to this are you?” She asked. Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
“Never let it be said that you weren’t intelligent,” he responded. She rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Fine. And who do you suggest my new ‘paramour’ should be?” Chloe asked. Lex smiled brightly at her and all of a sudden she felt very unsettled.<br>
<br>
“You’re going to let me choose?” He asked, the delight evident in his voice.<br>
<br>
“It’s your game, your rules,” she replied. The gleam in his eye was unnerving.<br>
<br>
“Well, in that case, me.”<br>

Lex leaned forward again with a grin. She stopped laughing and looked at him. “You’re not serious?”<br>
<br>
“My game, my rules,” he reminded her. Chloe’s mouth dropped open for a moment, but she quickly closed it and got a determined look on her face.<br>
<br>
“Okay,” she agreed. “I can’t believe I’m agreeing to this,” she mumbled. “What are the rules?” Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
“You know the first one,” he said with a smirk. Chloe rolled her eyes. “Second, you have to tell Pete, but only Pete. Despite what people might think, I don’t have a death wish. But it will ruin the game if everyone but Clark is in on it.” Chloe nodded. ‘That sounds reasonable,’ she thought. “And third, you have to be seen in public with me, even if Clark isn’t around.” Chloe snorted.<br>
<br>
“I’m in public with you right now and Clark is nowhere to be seen,” she pointed out. Lex got a glint in his eye.<br>
<br>
“I was thinking along the lines of something more substantial than coffee,” he said. Chloe frowned. “Do we have a game?” Lex asked and stuck out his hand. Chloe looked thoughtful, but Lex was counting on her stubborn streak winning out.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” she said. “I mean, how will Pete play?” Lex frowned. He hadn’t thought about that.<br>
<br>
“You’re going to tell him so he can play along, act as if your act is legitimate,” he said with a confidence that sounded like he had planned it all along. Chloe laughed again.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know if he’ll go for it Lex, he doesn’t like you very much,” Chloe observed. Lex smiled.<br>
<br>
“He doesn’t like me at all,” Lex replied. Chloe arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“So why are you smiling?” She asked. His smile turned into a smirk.<br>
<br>
“You called me by my first name,” he said. Chloe narrowed her eyes playfully at him.<br>
<br>
“No,” she argued. “I called you by your nickname. As I remember, Alexander is your first name.”<br>
<br>
“Semantics,” he said. “So, now that you know Pete’s role, do we have a game?” Chloe shook her head and smiled.<br>
<br>
“A game has to have a way to win,” she said. “How do you determine the winner?”<br>
<br>
“Some games are played merely for sport Chloe,” Lex answered. She smiled when he emphasized her first name.<br>
<br>
“Well I’m not going to play if I don’t get a chance at winning,” she responded. Lex chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Spoken like a true competitor,” he said. Lex paused and looked thoughtful. “The first one to tell any person about the game loses.”<br>
<br>
“That still leaves two potential winners,” Chloe said. Lex shrugged and took a sip of his coffee.<br>
<br>
“So the one loser will buy the two winners dinner,” he said.<br>
<br>
“Coffee,” she argued. “Little cash flow problem on my side, remember?”<br>
<br>
“You’re presuming that you’ll lose. I wouldn’t have thought that about you,” he said with a smirk.<br>
<br>
“No,” she said. “I’m presuming Pete will lose, and he’s in the same financial bracket I am.” Lex nodded.<br>
<br>
“Alright. Coffee it is,” he agreed. Chloe smiled and noticed Clark coming into the Talon.<br>
<br>
“We have a game,” she said. Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
“I take it that Clark just entered the building,” he said.<br>
<br>
“Funny, I didn’t notice eyes in the back of your head,” Chloe retorted. Lex shrugged.<br>
<br>
“The look on your face was enough,” he replied, not letting the twinge of sadness he felt creep into his voice.<br>
<br>
“You’re so going to lose,” she said to Lex with a smile and waved to Clark. “You think you can handle this?” Lex raised an eyebrow at the evil grin that crept across her lips. Clark came over and sat down in the chair directly across from them.<br>
<br>
“Hey guys,” Clark greeted. He looked back and forth between them, noting the looks on their faces with suspicion. “Please tell me you guys aren’t going to play Lana zone.” Chloe ripped her eye contact away from Lex and smiled broadly at Clark.<br>
<br>
“Of course not,” she said. “Lex and I have found better things to do with our time.” Lex had to hold back a chuckle at Clark’s confused, yet still suspicious look.<br>
<br>
“Substantially better,” Lex agreed and winked at Chloe. The action didn’t escape Clark’s attention and he tilted his head at them.<br>
<br>
“What are you two up to?” Clark asked. Chloe gave Lex another evil grin and then she slid her hand onto his thigh. He grinned back at her. Little did she know she was going right along with his real plan. Unfortunately, Clark didn’t notice where Chloe placed her hand.<br>
<br>
“Chloe and I were just discussing our upcoming trip to Metropolis Clark,” Lex answered. Clark raised his eyebrows in surprise and looked at Chloe.<br>
<br>
“You’re going to Metropolis with Lex?” He asked in disbelief. Chloe kept her attention focused on Lex. That was the game right? She gazed at him like he had just stepped out of one of her dreams and then she smiled.<br>
<br>
“Uh huh,” she answered. Clark furrowed his brow. Lex glanced over at Chloe and couldn’t stop a grin of delight from covering his mouth. ‘Okay, now I know something’s up,’ Clark thought to himself. He was brought out of his thoughts when he saw Lana come in. Chloe noticed too and she smiled at Clark. “Are you sure we can’t play Lana zone?” She teased. Clark gave her a half smile.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I’m sure,” he said as he rose from his seat. “Be right back you guys.” Lex took Clark’s momentary absence as an opportunity. He leaned over and whispered into Chloe’s ear.<br>
<br>
“You’re entirely too good at this,” he said. “I may have underestimated my competition.” Chloe smiled in agreement. Clark started talking to Lana and Lana glanced over in time to catch Lex’s mouth next to Chloe’s ear. Her mouth dropped open a little.<br>
<br>
“Um, Clark?” She asked.<br>
<br>
“Yeah?” He replied with a shy smile. She tilted her head and furrowed her brow.<br>
<br>
“When did Chloe and Lex start dating?” Lana asked. Clark gave her a bemused expression.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?” He asked. She motioned toward the couple and Clark followed her gaze with his eyes. Lex had gone back to his upright position in his chair by the time Clark looked over though, and Clark just saw them talking. “Oh, they’re just talking about going to Metropolis,” he said as if it were nothing. Lana looked at him in shock, but quickly shook it off.<br>
<br>
“Okay,” she said, hoping that her tone didn’t give away her suspicions. Chloe sighed when she saw Clark talking to Lana.<br>
<br>
“He doesn’t have to be paying attention,” Lex reminded her. Chloe nodded and took a drink from her cup.<br>
<br>
“I know,” she said. “But,” Chloe paused when she saw a woman come in through the front door. “Isn’t that?” She motioned to the woman with her head. Lex turned his head and frowned.<br>
<br>
“Victoria,” he answered. Lex scowled and Chloe grinned almost giddily. Lex raised a questioning eyebrow at her.<br>
<br>
“I’m going to win,” she taunted. Lex grinned at Chloe as Victoria walked over to them.<br>
<br>
“Don’t count on it,” he responded. Lex looked up at Victoria when she arrived at their table, but he made no effort to stand.<br>
<br>
“Lex,” Victoria cooed.<br>
<br>
“Victoria,” Lex said dryly and took a sip of his coffee. Victoria noticed Chloe’s hand was on Lex’s thigh and she narrowed her eyes at her. Chloe just smiled. ‘I’m going to win,’ Chloe thought smugly. Chloe rose from her seat and motioned to Lex’s cup.<br>
<br>
“I need a refill,” she stated. “You want one too?” Lex gave her a half smile and nodded once. Chloe decided to take him by surprise, and leaned over and kissed him. Lex quickly took advantage of the situation and pulled her onto his lap, where he deepened the kiss. Victoria crossed her arms and seethed. Chloe pulled away from the kiss and tried to hide her shock at what had just happened.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry Victoria, have you met my girlfriend?” Lex asked with an amused expression. Lana and Clark had been on their way to the table when they saw the kiss and heard what Lex said. Lana turned to Clark.<br>
<br>
“I told you so,” she said.<br>

Lex seemed amused by the whole situation, so Chloe just played along. If he could do it, then she certainly could. She made no effort to move off his lap, but she extended her hand to Victoria in a confident manner.<br>
<br>
“Chloe,” she said as an introduction. Victoria glared at her, but she shook her hand.<br>
<br>
“Victoria,” she announced. Chloe nodded and pulled back her hand, only to place it on Lex’s chest. Pete walked into the Talon just in time to see the hand shake and was wondering just what the hell was going on. He smiled when he saw Clark and Lana openly gaping at Chloe and Lex though, and figured that they must be playing Lana zone or a different game. He walked over and stood next to Clark.<br>
<br>
“So Chloe’s meeting the ex huh? Weird,” Pete commented. Clark and Lana both looked at him with almost horrified expressions on their faces. Pete tried to keep himself from laughing. “Don’t worry, she can handle herself.”<br>
<br>
“So what brings you to Smallville Victoria?” Chloe asked in a sickeningly sweet voice. She was going to be damned if she let this pompous bitch intimidate her. Victoria narrowed her eyes at her.<br>
<br>
“Lionel, Lex’s father,” Victoria answered. Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
“I’m aware of who Lionel is, thanks,” she said sarcastically. Chloe glanced over at her friends when she heard Pete’s snicker. She shot him a silent look that asked him to play along and he smiled. Pete walked over to Chloe and Lex.<br>
<br>
“Your dad is sleeping with your ex?” He asked Lex. “Man, that’s screwed up.” Chloe bit her lip to keep herself from laughing.<br>
<br>
“I have to agree with you Mr. Ross,” Lex said seriously. “But then, Victoria and I were never an official couple per se, not like Chloe and I are, so I really have no complaints on the topic.” Pete smiled at Lex’s gall, and almost erupted in laughter when Victoria looked like she was going to blow steam out of her ears.<br>
<br>
“I’ll be sure and give your father your regards,” Victoria sneered at Lex, hoping that her statement would get a reaction out of him. This visit wasn’t going anywhere near how she had planned it.<br>
<br>
“My father is already aware of how I regard him,” Lex said dryly. Victoria clenched her hands into fists, let them go, and then she plastered a fake smile on her face.<br>
<br>
“I see,” she said. “Well both of you have a good evening then.” She ignored Pete and walked out of the Talon. Pete and Chloe both started laughing hysterically.<br>
<br>
“Damn!” Pete said. “I thought she was going to claw your eyes out for a minute there.” Chloe nodded.<br>
<br>
“Nah, her fake nails would have come off. She couldn’t risk that,” Chloe said. She turned to Lex. “You do realize she’s going to tell your dad whatever she thinks she knows about us?” Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
“I’m counting on it,” he said. ‘Damn,’ Chloe thought. She thought that would have made him concede defeat, but it hadn’t. She wondered what it would take to get him to lose. Clark and Lana braved their way over to the table.<br>
<br>
“Hi guys!” Lana greeted cheerfully. Chloe smiled at them, and then it hit her. The entire time she had been ‘playing’ with Lex, she hadn’t thought about her angst over the Clark Kent situation. Huh. ‘Interesting,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
“Hi Lana,” Chloe replied. She slid off of Lex’s lap and grabbed her bag from the floor. “And bye. I have to go now or I’m going to miss my bus.” Clark grabbed her arm.<br>
<br>
“I can give you a ride home,” he said. Lex frowned. ‘He picks now to be chivalrous?’ Lex thought. He stood up and cleared his throat, and then territorially placed his hand on the small of Chloe’s back.<br>
<br>
“I’ll take her, but thanks for your concern Clark,” Lex said. Clark eyed Lex with suspicion and then looked at Chloe.<br>
<br>
“Um, that whole thing with you sitting on his lap and kissing him, that was a game or something right? To make Victoria angry?” Clark’s questions came out uneasy and tinged with hopefulness. Chloe looked up at Lex with a smile and she could see him smirking. If he thought she was going to lose now, he had another thing coming.<br>
<br>
“Uh, well, no Clark,” Chloe said. Clark furrowed his brow and Lex looked a little surprised. Pete looked suspicious. “Lex and I are seeing each other now. You’re okay with that right?” Lana smiled broadly and let out a little giddy giggle. She gave Chloe a huge hug and pulled back.<br>
<br>
“Ooh! I knew it!” Lana proclaimed. “You guys have been doing the whole mating ritual thing for weeks now. I just knew it! I’m so happy for you Chloe!” Chloe was in shock, but she managed to smile.<br>
<br>
“Uh, thanks, I guess,” she said. Lex wrapped his arms around Chloe’s waist from behind and lightly kissed her neck. It bothered her that it felt so good, just like the kiss earlier had. ‘I will not think about sex with him,’ she told herself. An image floated through her head and she had to stifle a groan.<br>
<br>
“Awww,” Lana gushed and leaned against Clark. “Aren’t they cute?” She brought her hand up to her heart as she said it. ‘Lana Lang, drama queen,’ Chloe thought. ‘But she is being really nice about it.’ Pete opted not to say anything at this point. Chloe was still giving him that look like she wanted to say something, but just couldn’t in front of Clark, so he was trying to tell himself that it was just a game. If he let himself believe otherwise, Lex would be dead in a couple of minutes.<br>
<br>
“Right, well, as fun as all of this has been, I still need to get home,” Chloe said, noticing the look that was creeping across Pete’s face. She disentangled herself from Lex’s arms and he frowned. She gave him a sympathetic grin and kissed him lightly on the cheek. “You mind if Pete takes me home? I need to talk to him,” she said. Lex glared at Pete, but he nodded.<br>
<br>
“I can trust you, can’t I Pete?” Lex asked. Pete smiled broadly and held out his arm for Chloe.<br>
<br>
“Nope,” he half kidded. Chloe and Pete both started laughing and Chloe took his arm.<br>
<br>
“Funny,” Lex said sarcastically. “Call you later?” He asked Chloe. She smiled and nodded. Pete walked Chloe to his car and gave her a knowing look after they shut the doors.<br>
<br>
“Okay, it’s not the Lana zone, and you’re not really dating Lex, so what’s the game?” Pete asked. Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
“What makes you think I’m not really dating Lex?” She asked in a mock hurt voice. Pete chuckled.<br>
<br>
“He’s not your type,” he said. Chloe frowned.<br>
<br>
“I’ve been thinking about changing my type,” she said. “I’m sick of liking good looking farm boys who only lust after girls with dark hair and the initials ‘L, L’.” Pete laughed.<br>
<br>
“Hey, I’m all for supporting that decision,” he said and winked at her. She chuckled.<br>
<br>
“We haven’t come up with a name for the game yet. I just told him that I needed a new game besides Lana zone because it was getting too depressing,” Chloe finally answered. Pete glanced at her as he was driving.<br>
<br>
“Okay, so what are the rules?” He asked. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
“I’m not sure you’ll believe me if I tell you,” she said.<br>
<br>
“I’m not sure I’ll be able to restrain myself from killing Luthor if you don’t,” he said tongue in cheek. Chloe sniggered.<br>
<br>
“Fine,” she agreed. “I have to give all my attention to a man other than Clark. I don’t have to like him.” Pete raised his eyebrows.<br>
<br>
“And you picked Lex?” He asked in surprise. Chloe snorted.<br>
<br>
“No. His game, his rules. He chose,” she said. “Any time Clark is around I have to spend the entire time doting on him or talking about him if he isn’t there.” Pete grumbled.<br>
<br>
“Sounds like a sweet deal for Lex,” he commented. Chloe smiled and shook her head.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think so. I have a good feeling that I’m going to win,” she said.<br>
<br>
“And how do you win?” Pete asked as he pulled up to her house.<br>
<br>
“The first person to tell someone outside the game, being anyone other than you, me, or Lex, loses,” she said. “And that goes for you too, so don’t slip up and tell anybody or you’re going to owe Lex and I coffee.” Pete grinned.<br>
<br>
“At least it’s not dinner,” he said. Chloe nodded in agreement. Pete sighed. He wondered why Chloe couldn’t see through Lex’s pathetic excuse for a game. It was obvious that Lex liked her and was just using her stubborn and competitive nature to get her close to him. But, as long as Chloe wanted to play, he would go along with it. Besides, if they had more run-ins with Victoria or any other snooty rich people, it would be worth it just to see the looks on their faces. Maybe this would be a fun game after all.<br>
Chloe said goodbye to Pete and ran into her house. Gabe smiled at her from the couch when she came in.<br>
<br>
“Hi sweetheart,” he greeted. She went over to him and gave him a small hug.<br>
<br>
“Hi Dad,” she replied. Chloe took a good look at the expression on his face. “What?” She asked. Gabe leaned forward.<br>
<br>
“Mr. Luthor called for you,” he said. She tried not to let her eyes grow wide or let the string of profanities that was running through her head slip out of her mouth.<br>
<br>
“Oh?” She asked as non-chalantly as she could. “What did Lex have to say?” Gabe shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Not Lex,” he corrected. ‘Okay, this is bad,’ thought Chloe. “Lionel Luthor personally called and asked if you were free to join their family for dinner on Saturday.” Chloe grimaced.<br>
<br>
“You told him ‘no’ right?” She asked hopefully. Her dad looked bemused.<br>
<br>
“I thought you’d want to go,” he said. “You’ve been talking about wanting an interview with him for a couple of months now. Isn’t that what this is about?” Chloe’s mouth dropped open, but she turned it into a fake smile.<br>
<br>
“Probably,” she falsely agreed. “I’m just surprised that he finally gave in.” Gabe nodded.<br>
<br>
“Me too,” he said. “So behave yourself.”<br>

She paced around her room waiting for him to pick up. ‘He probably doesn’t even have it on,’ she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
“Come on Pete! Answer!” She said impatiently into the ringing phone. As if on cue, Pete picked up his phone.<br>
<br>
“Hello?” He greeted.<br>
<br>
“Pete, it’s Chloe,” she rushed her words out. Pete smiled.<br>
<br>
“Miss me already huh?” He teased.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, yeah,” she said. “I have a problem.” Pete raised his eyebrows. Had she finally figured out that Luthor was just using the game to get close to her? Was he going to get his chance to kill him?<br>
<br>
“Yes?” He answered a little too giddily as the thoughts spun through his head. Chloe sighed.<br>
<br>
“Victoria told Lex’s dad that we’re together, at least I think she did. Anyway, he called here while I was out and told my dad that he wanted me to come over for a family dinner on Saturday, and my dad said yes!” Chloe rambled. Pete frowned.<br>
<br>
“You could always call back and say you’re busy,” he said. Chloe nodded, still clutching the phone to her ear.<br>
<br>
“I thought about that,” she admitted. “But what am I supposed to say? I already have plans? The whole point of the game is to not let anyone else know that it isn’t real, which I would basically have to do to get out of this dinner.”<br>
<br>
“So throw in the towel Chlo, it’s just a game. And it’s just coffee that you’ll have to buy for the winners,” he said. Chloe grunted.<br>
<br>
“That being you and Lex if I concede,” she grumbled and paused while she thought about it. “Nope. I’m not going to do it. I’m going to win this game. And if I have to pretend to like Lex like that in front of his dad, then so be it.” Pete wasn’t surprised. He knew she wouldn’t give up so easily.<br>
<br>
“Ask Lex if you can bring someone else,” he suggested.<br>
<br>
“I doubt Lex even knows about this little dinner,” she said. “Unless he’s gone home and run into his father,” she mused. “Also, I don’t have his number, and I really don’t want to try and explain to my dad why I would need to get it from him.” Pete chuckled. “Wipe that smile off your face right now Pete Ross.” The chuckle turned into a full-blown laugh.<br>
<br>
“Okay, okay,” he said between breaths. “Saturday isn’t for a couple of days, and I’m sure you’ll run into Lex in the mean time.”<br>
<br>
“Probably,” she agreed. She glanced at the clock. “Are you on your way home?”<br>
<br>
“Nah, on my way back to the Talon,” he answered.<br>
<br>
“Why?” She asked suspiciously.<br>
<br>
“How am I supposed to be an active participant of this game unless I’m there?” He theorized. Chloe rubbed her face.<br>
<br>
“Good point,” she said. “I have to go Pete. I’ll talk to you later okay?” Pete grinned.<br>
<br>
“Night chica,” he said and clicked off his phone. He pulled up to the Talon and saw that Lex’s car was still parked out front. “My lucky night,” he grumbled sarcastically. He walked into the building and waved at Clark, who coincidentally, was still talking to Lex. Clark didn’t seem happy though. ‘Good,’ Pete thought. ‘Maybe this whole game is getting to him too.’ “Hey,” he greeted and sat down next to Clark. Clark tried to smile, but it came out as more of a grimace.<br>
<br>
“Hey Pete,” he greeted. Lex smirked and nodded once.<br>
<br>
“Mr. Ross,” Lex said. Pete looked at Clark.<br>
<br>
“Hey, you know, I forgot to order,” Pete said. “Don’t suppose you want to go up to the counter for me and get some quality Lana watching time?” That seemed to cheer Clark up a little bit and he grinned.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, I need a refill anyway. Be right back,” Clark said. Pete noticed that Clark hadn’t offered to see if Lex needed a refill. ‘He must be more upset with him than I thought,’ Pete mused.<br>
<br>
“Okay, we have a problem,” Pete said in a hushed voice. Lex arched an eyebrow and sipped his coffee.<br>
<br>
“You don’t approve of the new game,” Lex stated. Pete gave him a ‘well, duh’ look and then shook his head.<br>
<br>
“That too,” Pete said. “But the problem I was talking about is that your dad invited Chloe to a family dinner on Saturday, and since she wasn’t there to take the call, her dad already told him yes.” Pete didn’t know how he was expecting Lex to take the news, but certainly not how he ended up taking it. The corners of Lex’s lips curled upward.<br>
<br>
“Really?” He asked in an amused voice. “That should prove to be an interesting evening.” Pete glared at him.<br>
<br>
“According to ‘your rules’, I should get to go to the dinner too,” Pete said with a tiny smirk. Lex frowned and Pete’s smirk turned into a smile. “After all, you need someone to back up your claim. Isn’t that my role?” Lex squared his jaw and nodded once.<br>
<br>
“Dinner is usually held at seven,” Lex said. He quickly glanced at Pete’s apparel. “And you’ll need to wear a suit or my father will eat you alive.” Pete’s smile fell and he reluctantly nodded.<br>
<br>
“Fine,” he said through gritted teeth.<br>
<br>
“Looks like an intense conversation,” Clark said as he walked over and put Pete’s cup on the table in front of him. “What are you talking about?”<br>
<br>
“Apparently my father has taken it upon himself to get to know Chloe better. He invited her to a ‘family’ dinner on Saturday,” Lex paused. “You know how my father is Clark.” Clark nodded. “I thought she might feel more comfortable if she had another friend there as well, and Mr. Ross has just informed me that he would be happy to oblige.” Clark raised a speculative eyebrow at Pete.<br>
<br>
“What about me?” Clark asked Lex, but was still partially looking at Pete. Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
“Under the circumstances, I don’t think that would be a very good idea,” Lex said. Clark narrowed his eyes slightly.<br>
<br>
“Why?” He asked. Lex leaned forward in his chair.<br>
<br>
“Clark, you told me that Chloe used to have feelings,” Lex winced a little but tried not to show it, “other than friendship for you.” Clark nodded. “I don’t think it would make her very comfortable to have her former crush sitting at the table with us.” Clark paled. He hadn’t thought of himself in that context. Secretly, he was still kind of hoping that Chloe liked him, but just didn’t want to ruin their friendship.<br>
<br>
“Oh,” Clark said. “I guess that makes sense.” Pete had to hand it to Lex. He had managed to make the whole thing sound like his idea, and still incorporate it into the game. Chloe would have a difficult time winning this one. Pete inwardly frowned. He had no doubt that Lex was just using the game to get Chloe’s attention, and he had a sinking feeling that it was going to work.<br>
<br>
Lex stood up and said goodnight to Clark and Pete. He was itching to get home and talk to Lionel about intruding in his personal affairs. Not that he hadn’t been expecting it, and torturing his father with the sounds of he and Chloe cooing at each other was strangely appealing, but a small part of him still wished that Lionel had been sincere in his intentions. That he just wanted to get to be part of his son’s life. Lex sped down the roads to his house and chuckled morbidly at the thought.<br>
<br>
When he got into the house, he found his father and Victoria waiting for him in the den. She had a smug expression on her face and a brandy glass in her hand.<br>
<br>
“Lex,” she greeted with a fake smile. “You were able to tear yourself away from your blonde toy.” Lex barely acknowledged her presence; instead he turned his attention immediately to his father.<br>
<br>
“Chloe tells me that you’ve invited her to have dinner with us on Saturday,” he said. A creepy smile crawled across Lionel’s mouth.<br>
<br>
“Actually, I invited her to have dinner with ‘me’ on Saturday. Her father must have misunderstood,” Lionel answered. Lex noticed Victoria’s lips start to thin through the corner of his eye.<br>
<br>
“I see,” Lex said, not showing any of the emotion that Lionel had been trying to rattle out of him. “In that case, I’ll call and tell her that our original plans are back on.” Lionel let out a dramatic sigh.<br>
<br>
“You sound like you don’t trust me son,” he said with mock hurt lining his voice.<br>
<br>
“I don’t,” Lex admitted dryly. He turned to leave the room.<br>
<br>
“A family dinner it is then,” Lionel stated as if his word was law. Lex stopped walking for just a minute and resisted rolling his eyes. He was more than willing to play the game in front of Lionel and Victoria. It would just bring him one step closer to winning what he really wanted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFF0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bscifichick774fanficarchive42327.showUserPublicProfile?gid=scifichick774>scifichick774</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#000000>(2/24/03 7:30 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ch. 5</span><hr size=1> Chloe didn’t know why she felt nervous. It was just dinner, and it was just a game. She had no reason to be nervous, or at least that’s what she kept telling herself. The fact that she kept looking in the mirror to make sure she looked all right would suggest that deep down she felt otherwise. She heard the doorbell ring and she cursed under her breath. Chloe made up her mind right then and there that she was going to win this game no matter what. Even if she had to embarrass herself in front of her dad, which she knew was right about to happen. She walked down the stairs and saw her father talking to Lex. They seemed to be friendly enough. ‘Maybe this won’t be so bad,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
“Hey Lex,” she greeted. Lex turned his head to look at her. His lips spread into an appreciative smile when he took in her appearance. She was wearing a simple wine colored dress that hung to her curves without looking cheap. ‘Not that she ever could,’ he pondered.<br>
<br>
“Chloe,” he said and held his hand out for her. She didn’t bother to raise an eyebrow or motion for Lex not to be that way around her dad. Instead, she walked over and took his hand. Gabe watched the scene with confusion and a tinge of suspicion. He cleared his throat and looked at Chloe.<br>
<br>
“Something I should know about?” Gabe asked as he folded his arms across his chest. Chloe took a deep breath and smiled at her dad.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?” She asked, feigning innocence. Gabe motioned to their joined hands with his head and Chloe briefly followed his gaze. “Oh! Lex and I are – seeing each other,” she paused when Gabe’s eyes grew large. “Sort of,” she quickly added. Lex smirked at her, but inwardly frowned. He would be happy if he won the game, but it would be a small consolation compared to what he really wanted, and for that to happen then the game would need to keep going for a while. Chloe looked up and saw his smirk. She barely narrowed her eyes at him and plastered a fake smile on her face. “You didn’t tell him?” Lex returned her look and wrapped his arm around Chloe’s back.<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry Gabe, I have nothing but honorable intentions toward your daughter,” Lex said. Chloe held back a snort. She wondered how he was able to say that with a straight face. Despite the fact that she was wearing heels, she rose to her tiptoes and kissed Lex on the cheek.<br>
<br>
“If we don’t leave now, we’re going to be late,” she murmured into his ear. Lex tried to ignore the tingle that shot down his spine when he felt her warm breath in his ear. He smiled at her and nodded once to Gabe. Lex kept his arm tightly wrapped around Chloe’s back.<br>
<br>
“Good night Gabe,” Lex said. Chloe almost started laughing when she saw the look of disbelief on her dad’s face. She smiled brightly and walked over to give him a quick hug.<br>
<br>
“I’ll be back by eleven,” she said. Lex arched an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“You will?” He asked. She glared at him and he smiled. Chloe shook her head.<br>
<br>
“Night Dad,” she said and waved goodbye to him. Gabe stood in the doorway and watched his daughter walk with his boss, Lex Luthor, to Lex’s car, which probably cost more than he made in a year. He sighed. There were definite disadvantages to raising a strong willed daughter. Gabe mumbled something to himself about her being grounded when she got home and then he shut the door.<br>
<br>
Lex sped along Smallville’s back roads and was surprised when Chloe didn’t seem even a little bit frightened. Dangerous speeding usually got a good reaction out of most of the women he had dated. In fear, they would grip onto anything close, which would generally be him. But Chloe wasn’t fazed at all. She looked completely comfortable, leaning back in the leather seat and gazing out the window.<br>
<br>
“I know what you’re thinking,” Chloe said, breaking the silence that had encompassed them. Lex glanced at her.<br>
<br>
“Do you? I didn’t realize you had developed your Jedi abilities,” Lex quipped. Chloe burst out in laughter.<br>
<br>
“You’re a Star Wars fan?” She asked. He raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“You’re the one who can read minds,” he said. “You tell me.” She chuckled.<br>
<br>
“I’m going to say yes,” she said after a moment of mock thoughtfulness. He smirked.<br>
<br>
“And I’m going to say that was just a lucky guess,” he replied. Chloe shrugged. “Now what were you going to say earlier?”<br>
<br>
“Oh,” Chloe said, snapping back to her original thoughts. “I was going to say that you were awfully quiet, so you were probably thinking that you were going to lose the game at the dinner tonight.” The confident grin on her face made Lex smile.<br>
<br>
“Actually, I was thinking how surprised I was that you didn’t lose in front of your dad,” Lex lied. Chloe’s smile faded.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, that was pretty hard,” she admitted. “I have a bad feeling that I’m going to be grounded when I get back.” Lex smiled sympathetically at her.<br>
<br>
“Sorry,” he said. She shrugged.<br>
<br>
“It was a risk,” she said. “So how well do you and your dad get along?” Lex’s face went to a stone-like appearance.<br>
<br>
“Not well,” he replied. Chloe felt bad for him. Although Lex wasn’t showing any emotional response, which in itself was an indicator of how bad he must feel about the situation. She decided to try and cheer him up.<br>
<br>
“So how far am I allowed to take this thing tonight?” She asked with a gleam in her eye. Lex felt a grin creep across his lips.<br>
<br>
“As far as you’d like,” he said suggestively. Chloe started laughing.<br>
<br>
“I don’t want your dad to get mad at you,” she said and then looked pensive. “Although, that ‘would’ probably give me the upper hand in winning the game.” It was Lex’s turn to chuckle. He pulled the car over in front of the manor.<br>
<br>
“I think I should warn you,” he said as he opened her door for her. “My father has a tendency to.” He paused and flinched ever so slightly. Chloe raised an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“A tendency to?” She repeated. Lex grimaced.<br>
<br>
“He’s going to hit on you,” he said with a disgusted sigh. Chloe’s eyes grew wide.<br>
<br>
“You’re joking,” she said. “You’re saying this to throw me off my game, right?” Lex’s expression didn’t change and she paled. Chloe’s mouth dropped open, but she quickly shut it. “Oh.” Chloe was pulled out of her thoughts by the sound of a car horn. Both Lex and Chloe turned around to see Pete parking his car in the driveway. She furrowed her brow. “What’s Pete doing here?” She asked. Lex grinned and placed a hand on the small of her back.<br>
<br>
“I thought tonight might go easier for you if he was here,” Lex said. She gave him a look that said she clearly didn’t believe him and his grin turned into a smile. “Pete said he had to be here if he was going to be part of the game,” Lex admitted. Chloe laughed and walked over to Pete to give him a hug.<br>
<br>
“Hey,” Pete greeted and hugged her back. She smiled appreciatively at his suit.<br>
<br>
“You got dressed up,” she commented. Pete rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Lex said I had to,” he admitted. Chloe laughed and wrapped her arm around his.<br>
<br>
“Well, I’m glad you’re here. It just wouldn’t be a game without you,” she said. Pete smiled and Lex cleared his throat.<br>
<br>
“You’re supposed to be doting on ‘me’ Miss Sullivan,” he reminded her. Chloe and Pete exchanged an amused look and she let go of Pete’s arm. She walked over and stood on her toes to kiss his cheek.<br>
<br>
“Sorry dear,” she chimed. Lex smirked and wrapped his arms around her. Instinctively, she placed her hands on his upper arms. It caught her a little off guard since they weren’t in the house yet and Pete already knew about the game. She gave him a questioning look and he smiled down at her.<br>
<br>
“We have an audience,” he murmured as he inched his face closer to her. “Victoria is standing by the window.”<br>
<br>
“Oh,” Chloe said. Lex leaned down and placed a gentle kiss on her lips. Her hands ran up his arms and around his neck as she allowed herself to melt into it. Their mouths became more demanding, and they only broke apart when Pete cleared his throat loudly.<br>
<br>
“You guys aren’t going to be doing that all night are you?” Pete asked. “Because, ewww.” Chloe laughed and Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
“You’re the one who wanted to come,” Lex reminded him. Pete glared at him.<br>
<br>
“Yeah, yeah. Let’s just get this over with,” Pete said. They walked into the house, where a staunch butler promptly met them.<br>
<br>
“Your father has requested that you join him in the dining room,” the butler said. Lex nodded. “Dinner will be served in ten minutes.” With that, the butler turned on his heel and left the room. Lex grinned at Chloe and then kissed her on her temple.<br>
<br>
“Ready sweetheart?” He asked. She took in a deep breath and nodded. They started walking toward the dining room.<br>
<br>
“As I’ll ever be,” she mumbled. “I just hope that he’s not as bad as he was the last time I met him.” Both Lex and Pete looked surprised.<br>
<br>
“You’ve met Lex’s dad before?” Pete asked. Chloe stared ahead blankly.<br>
<br>
“Yeah,” she said. Lex furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Lex asked. Chloe shook her head a little to snap her out of her stupor.<br>
<br>
“Not so much an experience that I wanted to relive,” she admitted. Lex stopped walking and made eye contact with her.<br>
<br>
“Did he hurt you?” Lex asked, a menacing quality lining his voice. Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
“Not like you think,” she said. “He basically told me that I shouldn’t waste my time with journalism and I should put my obvious attributes to better use.” She cringed when she said it. Pete shivered.<br>
<br>
“Dirty old man,” Pete commented. The expression on Lex’s face told Pete that he agreed with him.<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry Chloe. Both Pete and I are here to protect you,” Lex said. Chloe laughed and started walking again.<br>
<br>
“I’m quite capable of taking care of myself, thank you very much,” she said. Lex turned to Pete.<br>
<br>
“Is she always this stubborn?” Lex asked. Pete smiled and cocked his head.<br>
<br>
“Don’t ask me,” Pete replied and slapped Lex on the back as he started walking again. “She’s your pretend girlfriend.” When they arrived at the dining room, they found Lionel and Victoria already waiting for them.<br>
<br>
“Lex,” she said happily and strolled over to him. She gave a death glare to Chloe, who in return just smiled. Victoria raised an eyebrow at Pete’s presence. “I thought just you and…” She looked at Chloe as if she had forgotten her name.<br>
<br>
“Chloe,” Lex filled in for her.<br>
<br>
“Chloe,” Victoria repeated with disgust. “I thought only the two of you were to be joining us for dinner tonight.” Lex motioned toward Pete.<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry to hear that your information was yet again so unreliable,” Lex smirked. “Pete Ross, Victoria Hardwick,” he introduced. Victoria huffed and made no motion to even acknowledge the introduction. Instead, she walked over to where Lionel now stood. Lionel tapped with his cane until he reached his son.<br>
<br>
“I am to imply from this fascinating conversation that the lovely Miss Sullivan is now in our presence?” Lionel sneered. Chloe rolled her eyes at Lex and Pete almost started laughing.<br>
<br>
“Mr. Luthor,” Chloe greeted in as pleasant of a voice as she could come up with. She clung onto Lex’s arm as if it was for dear life.<br>
<br>
“Now, now dear. Call me Lionel,” he said. Chloe glared at him. ‘Too bad he can’t see all the bad looks I’m giving him,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
“I’d rather not,” she admitted in an almost cold voice. Lionel’s eyebrows raised in surprise at her courage to speak to him like that. He smirked.<br>
<br>
“Apparently you’ve never heard the phrase ‘you can attract more flies with honey’,” Lionel responded. Chloe smiled broadly.<br>
<br>
“Actually I have Mr. Luthor,” she said. “I just have no desire to attract flies.” Lex and Pete both snickered. Lex rubbed his hand on Chloe’s back and spoke into her ear.<br>
<br>
“Shall we?” Lex asked, guiding her to the table. He had a feeling that tonight would be the turning point in the game and he couldn’t wait.<br>

Lex rested his hand on her thigh and leaned over to speak in her ear.<br>
<br>
“Are you alright?” He asked in a concerned voice. “You’ve barely touched your meal.” Chloe grinned.<br>
<br>
“I’m fine,” she said. “Just not very hungry.” So far, the dinner had been okay, but Lionel and Victoria were starting to get to her. She didn’t care about Victoria so much, just because she wasn’t really going out with Lex, but Lionel had been relentlessly making sexual innuendos toward her and she was ready to slug him. Chloe decided to up the ante for the game. She tilted her head at Lex. “At least not for this,” she said in a suggestive voice. Lex nearly spit out the water he was sipping. When he returned to his normal breathing state he smirked at her and ran his hand further up her leg. He nuzzled his face into her hair.<br>
<br>
“Say the word and we can leave,” he murmured. Chloe smiled and Pete rolled his eyes.<br>
Pete had been pushing the food into his mouth like there was no tomorrow, and wasn’t thrilled with the possibility of leaving the wonderful meal behind.<br>
<br>
“Would you two knock it off?” Pete asked. “Nobody here wants to see you doing all that mushy stuff.” Lionel grinned.<br>
<br>
“Quite astute of you Mr. Ross,” Lionel agreed. Lex ignored them and began to kiss Chloe. She let out a small moan as he slid his tongue into her mouth. Victoria fumed and crossed her arms. This little blonde girl was taking the attention that should have been hers. Not just from Lex, but from Lionel too. ‘Luckily I still have one card left up my sleeve,’ she thought.<br>
<br>
“So when is the wedding?” Victoria asked. Lionel started choking slightly as his wine went down the wrong way. Pete smiled. This was the opening he had been waiting for. Finally, he could get back at them for making romantic gestures toward each other all night, without making it look like he wasn’t playing along with the game.<br>
<br>
“Yeah,” Pete started to get his evil grin on his face. “Have you guys set a date yet?” Lex and Chloe pulled away from each other and shared a look. It was a look of determination, silently asking how far the other person how far they were willing to go with the game in order to win. Chloe smirked and turned to the other people at the table. She was going to win this no matter what.<br>
<br>
“We haven’t talked about getting married,” she said in a sweet voice. “Right now, we’re just enjoying each other’s company.” She cast a challenging glance at Lex and he grinned.<br>
<br>
“You don’t want to get married?” He asked, trying to put an inflection of surprise and hurt into his question. He leaned closer and nipped at her neck. She tried to control the sensation that she suddenly felt coursing through her body, but was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>
“I, I,” she stammered when she felt his tongue on the shell of her ear. “I hadn’t really considered it.&quot;<br>
<br>
“Alexander, that’s quite enough,” Lionel said. “Thank God I only have to hear you doing unspeakable things to the girl.” Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
“I could be doing more if you hadn’t forced us to come to dinner tonight,” Lex replied in a calm voice. Chloe and Pete both had to bite back their laughter when they saw the looks on Lionel and Victoria’s faces. Lionel pulled back his expression and put on his game face.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t force ‘you’ to come son,” Lionel said. “I merely extended an invitation to the lovely young woman next to you.”<br>
<br>
“And she’s turned you down repeatedly through the evening,” Lex observed and sat back in his chair. Lionel sloughed off the comment.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps she’s not aware of the fact that I’m considerably more solvent than you are,” Lionel sneered. “Young lady, if you’re going to date someone for his money, you should at least do it right.” It was an insult and a pick up line at the same time. Chloe shook her head in disbelief.<br>
<br>
“I’m not dating Lex for his money,” Chloe responded. ‘I’m not dating him at all,’ she thought. Lionel seemed surprised, but barely let it show.<br>
<br>
“Of course you are my dear,” he said. “You may not realize it, but you are. What other possible attraction could there be? You were attracted to his power, his position, the way he exudes strength. All of those things come with having money.” Chloe took a deep breath and turned to Lex.<br>
<br>
“If I hit him will you be mad at me?” She asked through gritted teeth. Lex chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Actually, I’d love to see that,” he answered. Pete smiled and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Me too,” Pete said. Chloe smiled and shook her head, and then she looked at Lex.<br>
<br>
“Maybe we should just leave,” she said. Lex grinned and pushed his chair away from the table. He stood up and extended his hand to help Chloe out of her seat.<br>
<br>
“Don’t be so hasty,” Lionel said. “I promise to behave myself if Chloe can give me a valid reason, other than your money, as to why she likes you.” He paused for a second and Chloe shivered at the pure evil she saw in his expression. “In fact, I’ll even give your relationship with her my blessing.” Lex glanced at Chloe and then back to his father.<br>
<br>
“I don’t care if we have your blessing or not,” Lex replied. Chloe slipped her hand into his and gave it a small squeeze.<br>
<br>
“It’s okay,” she told Lex. Chloe walked over to Lionel. “You want to know why I like your son?” He nodded. “He’s cute, he’s smart, he’s funny, and,” she paused when a deliciously evil thought crept into her head. “He’s great in bed.” Pete burst out in laughter, but turned it into an uncomfortable cough when everyone looked at him. Lionel reached out for Chloe and found her hand, but she quickly ripped it away from him.<br>
<br>
“Darling, if you think Alexander is a good lover, it just proves that you’re ready for someone more…experienced,” Lionel said in a sensual tone. Even Victoria cringed. This evening hadn’t gone the way she wanted at all. Chloe laughed.<br>
<br>
“Not interested,” she said. “And I thought you said you were going to behave yourself?” Lionel smiled and Lex frowned. Was Chloe flirting with him? Lex walked over to her and wrapped his arm around her waist. He leaned down and sweetly kissed the crook of her neck.<br>
<br>
“I thought we were leaving,” Lex half whispered. She tilted her head to look at him.<br>
<br>
“Absolutely,” she agreed. Pete got up from his seat and walked to the dining room door. He casually leaned against the frame while waiting for Chloe and Lex to say their goodbyes.<br>
<br>
“Father,” Lex acknowledged as a farewell greeting. Lionel smirked.<br>
<br>
“Son,” he responded. Lex and Chloe started to walk away. “Chloe?” She turned around.<br>
<br>
“It was a pleasure dining with you. I do hope I didn’t make you uncomfortable,” Lionel said polite, charming tone. Lex squared his jaw and clenched his hands into fists, but quickly released them when Chloe wrapped her arm around him as well. He stared down at her with a questioning expression on his face.<br>
<br>
“The only way you would have made me uncomfortable is if I would have taken you up on your offers,” Chloe said to Lionel. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, Lex and I would like to spend some time alone this evening.” Lex smirked and walked out the door with Chloe and Pete. Lionel turned his head in Victoria’s general direction.<br>
<br>
“He was smirking wasn’t he?” He asked. Victoria sighed and came to sit down next to him.<br>
<br>
“Yes,” she confirmed. Lionel nodded.<br>
<br>
“I hate that smirk.”<br>
<br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
<br>
“You think I’m cute?” Lex asked, reminding Chloe of what she told his father. Lex had a goofy smile on his face and Chloe rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Sure,” she answered. His smiled grew more confident.<br>
<br>
“And smart? And funny?” He continued.<br>
<br>
“Are you done?” She asked impatiently. Chloe refused to make eye contact with him. They were only five minutes into the drive back to her house and he couldn’t stop talking about how she had handled Lionel.<br>
<br>
“No,” he said. Chloe smiled.<br>
<br>
“I also said you were good in bed, although I have no evidence to back up that claim,” she said. ‘That should shut him up,’ she thought. Lex smirked.<br>
<br>
“I believe you said ‘great’, not ‘good’, and I’d be more than happy to show you,” he responded. Her eyes grew a little wider, but then she started laughing. Chloe playfully hit his arm.<br>
<br>
“You almost had me going there for a minute,” she said. Lex grinned.<br>
<br>
“Did I?” His voice was smooth and husky, and Chloe looked away from him so he wouldn’t see her blush. “Tell me Chloe, is our game working?” She looked back at him in confusion.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?” She asked. He grinned at her response.<br>
<br>
“When was the last time you thought about Clark?” Lex asked. Chloe seemed surprised, although more by her answer than by his question.<br>
<br>
“A couple days now,” she admitted. Lex nodded.<br>
<br>
“That was the point of the game wasn’t it?” He asked. Chloe smiled in agreement.<br>
<br>
“Yeah,” she said. He pulled up to her house and stopped the car. Lex briefly glanced at the clock on the dashboard.<br>
<br>
“I got you home early,” he observed. “I don’t suppose that’s going to cut you any slack as far as a possible grounding is concerned?” Chloe shook her head and Lex got out of the car to open the door without waiting for the rest of her response.<br>
<br>
“Probably not,” she said when he gave her his hand to help her out. He grinned down at her and placed his hands on her hips.<br>
<br>
“Well, in that case,” he said. Lex moved his lips toward hers and they gently touched. Chloe was beginning to see that their game had definite advantages. She liked the way he kissed, the way he felt. Chloe pushed the thoughts out of her head as she pulled him closer and deepened the kiss. ‘I will not like Lex Luthor,’ she told herself. Their tongues slid together and she moaned. ‘I will not like…oh, what the hell.’ They continued their passionate embrace until Chloe needed to breathe. She rested her forehead on his chest.<br>
<br>
“Was my dad watching?” She asked in a hushed voice. Lex furrowed his brow.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know,” he admitted. “Why?” Chloe raised her eyes to look at him.<br>
<br>
“Isn’t that why you kissed me?” She asked in surprise. He smiled and noticed that she hadn’t pushed herself out of his arms.<br>
<br>
“Chloe, do you really think I chose myself for the game by chance?” Lex asked. She narrowed her eyes at him.<br>
<br>
“I knew you liked playing Lana zone with me, I just figured that,” she said, her words cut off by him kissing her again.<br>
<br>
“If you hadn’t noticed, you’ve had my full attention for some time now,” Lex started to explain. “I just wanted to make sure I had yours.” Chloe’s mouth dropped open a little, but she turned it into a smile. She brought his mouth down to hers once again and kissed him.<br>
<br>
“You do.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The End<br>
<br>
I know, this one wasn’t as funny, but I hope I provided some good banter for you to snicker at. Please let me know what you thought.<br>
