The house show is sold out and the everybody is on their feet. Scott Hudson and King are calling all the action at ringside as The Rock's locker room is shown. Kevin Kelly is shown standing right by The Rock's locker room. The door opens and Kevin Kelly moves to the side. Then The Rock keeps on walking to the side as he doesn't see anybody. The Rock is wearing his shirt and his glasses.<br><br><I><font color=green>Hey Rock, can I have a word with you for a second?<br><br><font color=blue>Yeah Jabroni, hurry up The Rock needs his cofee.<br><br><font color=green>Rock, on Sunday your going to go...</I><br><br><font color=red>The Rock snatches the mic away from Kevin Kelly<br><br><I><font color=blue>Finally, The Rock has come back to Philadelphia, Kevin Kelly, you masterbating jabroni, you tell The Rock who he's going to face, you tell The Rock he's going to face the jackass they call priimetime, and the ignorant @#%$ RVD. Well, Kevin Kelly, your right The Rcok is going to face two jackasses and The Rock is going to beat both of them from one side of the ring to the other. As The Rock said before, The Rock is going to be the next undisputed champion and the first undisputed champion since the opening of the eWo. And The Rock is going to do it at Spring Stampede in front of the millions and millions of The Rock's fans. The Rock is going to layeth the smackitdown on their candy asses. Now, Kevin Kelly, next question jackass.<br><br><font color=green>Okay, now Rock you will be facing you new enemy Primetime Elix Skipper, now just like you Primetime has won every single match he's been in. Just like you also RVD has one both of his matches and one was a ladder match. Now Shane has said that he's going to book a stipulation to that match. Rock, do you have any idea to what that stip might be?<br><br><font color=blue>Okay Jabroni it goes like this, The Rock hates Primetime, The Rock thinks Primtime is a jackass and it doens't matter what stipulation The Rock is still going to come out victourious. It doesn't matter if its' a Hell In a Cell,  A Cage or a Panus in your anus, The Rock is still going to be the Undisputed Champion. The Rock is still going to be right at the top and there ain't a damn skippy thing anyone could do about that. Primetime, you may have built this house but The Rock has lived in it. And come Sunday, The Rock is going to move out and let it rot. The Rock is going to move to his house, The Undisputed/ People's Champion house and if you or RVD wants to stop The Rock, The Rock is cool witht that. But let The Rock tell you that The Rock is not going to take it easy but The Rock will put the pounding every single second...whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Kevin Kelly, what in the bluest of alll bluest hell are you doing. Were you just picking your nose.<br><br><img src=http://www.therock.com/photos/champ/images/140.jpg> <br><br><font color=green>No Rock, I wasn't picking my nose.<br><br><font color=blue>Wait, Are you lying to The Rock?<br><br><font color=green>Well Rock, I had a really bad itch and it was all the way down there and I had to get it.<br><br><font color=blue>So you lied to The Rock, well The Rock has punishments for lying, The Rock says pick your nose in front of this audience right here. Go on, go ahead, The Rock wants to see you pick your nose. Go ahead Pick your nose GOD DAMN IT!<br><br><img src=http://www.therock.com/photos/champ/images/142.jpg><br><br>Ewww, The Rock was playin around but you actaully did it. Kevin Kelly, The Rock must say that you are one sick bastard. Well, The Rock feels very sorry for your mom. Anywayz back to business, So Sunday, The Rock has three words for ya, The Rock has given three words for every single person The Rock has faced in the eWo, The Rock will keep giving these words even when he's 87. Those three words are Just Bring IT! If ya smelllllallalaau what The Rock is cookin.</I><br><br><img src=http://www.therock.com/photos/champ/images/144.jpg><br><br><font color=red>The Rock walks away as the fans are going crazy and Kevin Kelly is still playing around with his nose and then the eWo goes to commercial.</B><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=27.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=27.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.threadControl?topicID=27.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ewo80708frm1">eWo RP Board<option value="ewo80708frm2">eWo OOC Board<option value="ewo80708frm3">eWo Nitro<option value="ewo80708frm4">eWo 2 NighT</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bewo80708>eWo</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1>eWo RP Board</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
