All right...<br>
<br>
Affirmative Opening Statement: &quot;Resolved:According to the Bible, baptism is not essential for salvation. The Bible shows in detail how salvation is to take place. What is the real transformation that takes place at salvation? What is the purpose of baptism? These are questions that are essential for either side to answer for this debate, and I will attempt to answer them with the Bible as my main source. However, let me prelude my case with a quote from Francis Schaeffer-&quot;Our Confession of Faith, Chapter 28, Section 5, makes it very clear that our subordinate standards do not teach Baptismal Regeneration: &quot;Although it be a great sin to condemn or neglect this ordinance, yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as that no person can be regenerated or saved without it, or that all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whitetigress2004>whitetigress2004</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;><b>The Poet</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#B87333>(10/12/03 10:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Challenge #1 debate- Is baptism necessary for salvation?</span><hr size=1> Ah *smiles* nicely done, darkmast :)<br>
 <br>
K, here is my intro : Baptism must be, as he says, clearly defined during the beginning of this debate: it is a point upon which both of our arguments surely pivot. Using the KJV Bible as my main source, i hope to &quot;prove&quot; that Baptism is and has been, since the death of our Lord and Saviour, necessary for salvation. Also, it would do well for the audience to keep in mind that this is a *fun* debate. It is my hope that, overall, the accomplishment of this debate is study of God's word and spiritual enlightenment for all of us :)<br>

Grace according to Merriam Webster is 1) a : unmerited divine assistance given humans for their regeneration or sanctification 2.) a : Approval, favor. So, we are &quot;saved&quot; by grace, that is, God's approval spawned &quot;through faith.&quot; Faith, according to Hebrews 11:1, &quot;is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&quot; So, God forgives us because of our faith in Him. Perhaps the easiest evidence of this comes from Rom 10:9 which states quite clearly &quot;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.&quot; <br>
    <br>
Notice the common theme that is NOT present in these verses. Works is not a factor. In fact, not once is baptism even alluded to. You can even keep going with this thought and see in the Ephesians verse that, in fact, &quot;works&quot; cannot be a part of salvation &quot;lest anyone should boast.&quot; Let's look at this in relation to Jesus. I think we could all agree that Jesus never had to be saved. The virgin birth made it clear that Jesus did not have a &quot;sin nature&quot; that He had to be saved from. Now, why then was Jesus baptized? Well, it is evident at the end of the baptism. Jesus received the blessing of God in the shape of a dove. This then, is the purpose of baptism. It relates us with Christ and, ultimately with God.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whitetigress2004>whitetigress2004</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;><b>The Poet</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#B87333>(10/15/03 4:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative Case #1</span><hr size=1> I would like to point out that nowhere does Dark say, with proof, that baptism is a work: yes, we are baptised with water, but who is to say that it isn't just as much spiritual as physical-to use dark's own example, Christ was baptised, and when He was, He received the Holy Ghost, as seen in Luke 3:22: and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove: surely the recieving of the Spirit is not purely physical? Is it then not logical that perhaps it is baptism in combination with faith that saves us? When Christ tells Nicodemus in John 3:5, &quot;He who is not born of water and of the Spirit cannot enter into the kingdom of God,&quot; it is entirely possible that He is talking of water baptism and spiritual baptism. <br>
<br>
Notice carefully the exact wording of the verse darkmast quoted: Hebrews 11:1- faith is the evidence of things unseen, the substance of things hoped for. According to Merriam Webster *chuckle* evidence is: 1 a : an outward sign : INDICATION b : something that furnishes proof : so, true faith shows evidence, if &quot;faith&quot; does not show evidence (which is, keep in mind, an outward sign or something that furnishes proof) then it is not faith; baptism is an outward sign which will, by someone who truly has faith, and thus is truly saved, be shown. So, it is logical that one who is not baptised does not have faith, and thus is not saved. <br>
<br>
Futhermore, i concede, those particular verses have nothing to do with baptism, but those are not the only verses dealing with salvation, either. Take into consideration the following:<br>
Acts 2:38   Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost;<br>
Acts 22:16    And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord;<br>
1 Peter 3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:<br>
Romans 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. Just becuase a few verses, or even the majority of verses, dealing with salvation make no mention of baptism, does not mean that baptism is not necessary, for, as we see in these verses, it truly is.<br>

In formal debates (unless we just decide to do it differently) rebuttals are supposed to be put in the form of questions, though, like I said, we can change this if you'd like. Now for my response...<br>
<br>
Luke 3:22 does shows the Holy Spirit descend on Jesus in bodily form, but I ask, what does that prove? It is obvious that this doesn't happen at every baptism so why was Jesus special. I submit that this was the start of Jesus' ministry. This was God showing that He blessed what His Son was doing. And it is quite obvious, as I stated in my case, that Jesus did not have to be saved. So, it is a fallacy to use the baptism of Jesus as a case for baptism into salvation because Jesus didn't have to be saved. I find it ironic that Merriam Webster's wording of the word evidence simply proves my point. Notice, it is an outward sign. It is something that identifies us with Christ, like I stated in my case. Also, the right wording of Hebrews 11:1 is &quot;Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&quot;  Now, read on. Notice that not once person is said to have faith and been baptized in that whole chapter. It is only &quot;By faith...&quot; It is funny that it only mention faith. &quot;Faith is...the evidence of things not seen.&quot; Notice that it doesn't say baptism there. And whitetigress did not show a link anywhere of not being baptized directly correlating with a lack of faith. <br>
<br>
I submit the following verses as a direct support of my argument.<br>
<br>
Acts 10:44-48<br>
While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. <br>
And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. <br>
For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, <br>
Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? <br>
<br>
Notice that these believers were instilled with the Holy Spirit even before they were baptized. And perhaps the most popular example of this is the thief on the cross. He was never baptized, but, in the words of Jesus, “To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.”<br>
<br>
Luke 7:48-50<br>
And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. <br>
And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? <br>
And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. <br>
<br>
Again, notice that Jesus never told her to go get baptized. Now, you may wonder, is the Bible conflicting with itself, because whitetigress’ verses seem to portray a different light on baptism. This is because the disciples were doing as they should. They were preaching repentance and baptism, both of which are done in obedience to God. And indeed, they preached very strongly that this should be done, almost to the point where it sounds synonymous with baptism, yet there is a distinct difference, as the above verses point out. I leave you with a few more…<br>
<br>
Rom. 5:1-2. &quot;Since we have been justified THROUGH FAITH, we have peace with God... whom we have gained access BY FAITH into this grace which we now stand&quot;<br>

2)  Darkmast's last post was a counterpoint and should have only been 1 paragraph.<br>

It will remain 'as is' since it was posted several hours ago- Whitetigress' first counterpoint will be allowed to be the same length THIS TIME ;-)<br>

<br>
Let us first look at the verses in the Bible that say that baptism is necessary for salvation:Mark 16:16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. <br>
Acts 2:38   Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>
Acts 2:41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls<br>
Acts 22:16    And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.<br>
Galatians 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.<br>
Mark 10: 38-39  But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?<br>
 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:<br>
1 Corinthians12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. <br>
John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. <br>
Peter 3:21The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:<br>
Romans 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. <br>
<br>
All these verses make it clear that Baptism is necessary for salvation.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkmast03>darkmast03</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;> <b>The Dark Knight and <br>Torchbearer of the<br> Tournaments!</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#B87333>(10/30/03 4:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative Case #1</span><hr size=1> How do you reconcile these verses with the Scripture I cited that showed people being indwelt by the Holy Spirit before baptism?<br>
<br>
How also do you reconcile these verses with the thief on the cross?<br>
<br>
Would it be a feasible interpretation of your verses that faith saves and baptism is to be the next step?<br>
<br>
Why do you think baptism is left out of so many references to salvation?<br>
<br>
Could you address the Greek meaning of eis, which is found in your Acts 2:38 verse?<br>
<br>
In 1 Peter 3:21, could you reconcile your insinuation that this verse teaches that you are saved by baptism with the next statement (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God)?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry it took so long to post this stuff. This debate is definitely a learning experience and quite the fun one.<br>

out of so many verses,&quot; I could do the same and ask, &quot;Why is it in so many verses;&quot; if it weren't necessary, then the word of God would not have said it were necessary at all, even in one place: EVERYTHING in the Bible is TRUE-that does not exclude verses dealing with baptism salvation; secondly, when my 1 Peter verse says, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, it is stating that the baptism it is talking about is not simple washing, not simply being dunked/sprinkled with water: the person has to  mean it, in the same way that, I am sure you would say, a person has to mean the words,<br>
&quot;Lord Jesus, save me, a sinner;&quot;  simply the words themselves are not enough. Nowhere does it state that being indwelt with the Holy Spirit is what causes one to be saved; no, it is not a correct interpretation to assume that these verses are saying that baptism is after the confession of the Lord Jesus Christ because some verses of the Bible also have to do with people being baptised before saying the prayer, and some people saying the prayer before being baptised, perhaps both are required, but they are requirements that can be fulfilled at separate times- everything in the Bible is true, it does not EVER contradict itself, so if it says that you have to believe to be saved in one verse, and then says that you have to believe and be baptised to be saved in another verse, then, assuming the Bible does not contradict itself, you must believe and baptised to be saved- if you only need to believe to be saved, then other verses would not add the &quot;and be baptised;&quot; as far as the thief on the cross, we have no clue when he had died, whether it was before or after Jesus, and we know nothing about whether he ever followed Jesus, heard<br>
of Jesus, or anything else- why would God have left that out, especially if it was the ONLY instance in scripture showing that baptism is not necessary for salvation; eis, greek, means:<br>
into, unto, to, towards, for, among &quot;For&quot; (as used in Acts 2:38 &quot;for the forgiveness...&quot;) could have two meanings; if you saw a poster saying &quot;Jesse James wanted for robbery&quot;, &quot;for&quot; could mean Jesse is wanted so he can commit a robbery, or is wanted because he has committed a robbery; (slightly edited, found at www.crosswalk.com) Crosswalk goes on, after this, to say that the &quot;for&quot; in their example means the latter- I would slightly agree, but ONLY slightly; since there is no context, crosswalk is making an ASSUMPTION that they have no right to make- in order to find out the true meaning of &quot;for&quot; on the sign, they would have to look at other things, do some research, find out if Jesse committed a robbery, and find out if whoever posted the sign wants to commit a robbery- if they found that Jesse had not committed a robbery, then the only thing it could mean is that he is wanted so that he can commit a robbery- so we must do essentially the same thing with the Bible, find out if it ever says anywhere else that baptism is necessary for salvation- I believe I have shown that there is a lot more than one verse in the Bible saying that baptism is necessary for salvation.<br>

The question of the thief on the cross, I believe, is a pivotal one, because, God's nature, Scripture says, is unchanging and if even one person were let into Heaven without baptism, then baptism must not be a requirement. The thief on the cross, we are told, died the same day he saw Jesus. &quot;This day you will be with me...&quot; This stands to reason that the thief was indeed in Heaven with Jesus that same day. Also, whitetigress said something about how the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is not what causes one to be saved. That is simply twisting what I was talking about, if it was in reference to my Scripture verse about the people who were indwelt by the Holy Ghost before baptism. This example shows proof that people can be saved before baptism. None of your verses can show conclusively that baptism is needed for salvation, and since I’m limited on the length, I will highlight a few.<br>
<br>
Mark 16:16- Simply put by a Greek expert, “I rather imagine that this passage is assuming that the person who believes will be baptized. It is only our modern deprecation of baptism that gives us problems here.”<br>
<br>
Acts 2:38- The reason I asked about the meaning of eis in this verse is to clear up a misconception, because eis should be interpreted “because of” rather than “for” according to yet another Greek expert. This does indeed clarify the message of the verse to mean that baptism is something we should do because we are forgiven.<br>
<br>
Romans 6:3-4- “When Paul made reference to believers being ‘baptized into Christ Jesus,’ he used an expression that's identical in construction to a statement in 1 Corinthians 10:2, where he said that the Israelites were &quot;baptized into Moses.&quot;<br>
<br>
And one verse that I am reminded of that directly contradicts this- If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Rom. 10:9-10).<br>
<br>
Also, let’s look at the correlation of between the OT and the NT forgiveness. In the OT, we see that the Israelites are commanded to sacrifice animals. The blood of the animals forgave the sins that were committed. Now, what correlation does baptism have? I see no place where baptism or any correlation thereof is discussed in the OT. Why would God change the prerequisites? The truth is that God actually didn’t change the prerequisites, salvation is still only by the blood of a sacrifice, the perfect Lamb of God; adding anything more detracts from that message and would mean that God changes.<br>
<br>
I’m afraid that’s all the case I had room for (I counted the sentences, so hopefully I’m right on the mark).<br>

If He were truly unchanging, then wouldn't we still have to sacrifice animals? Does everything in the NT have a parallel in the OT? Yes, i totally agree that God requires the blood of the Lamb for salvation, but how does adding baptism to that take away from His sacrifice? Why is it that there are so many verses that say that baptism is necessary for salvation? any one taken by itself is doubtlessly disputable, but when one takes the Bible together as a whole, it is easy to see that it never once says that baptism isn't necessary for salvation, does it? Does one verse not mentioning baptism at all actually mean that baptism isn't necessary? Isn't it possible that it simply wasn't mentioned because it is made clear in so many other passages?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkmast03>darkmast03</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;> <b>The Dark Knight and <br>Torchbearer of the<br> Tournaments!</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#B87333>(12/13/03 4:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative Case #1</span><hr size=1> Well, simply put, He doesn't change.  <br>
    Mal 3:6   For I [am] the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. <br>
&quot;Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.&quot; (Hebrews 13:8). When He makes a promise, He keeps it. His attributes are unchanging. Therefore, we can assume that His attribute of not allowing sin in front of Him is also unchanging. No, we wouldn't have to sacrifice animals; Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice that allows us the protection that was offered by sacrificing lambs except for the fact that His sacrifice is eternal.<br>
Quote:Does one verse not mentioning baptism at all actually mean that baptism isn't necessary?<br>
I would ask why there are so many verses that exclude baptism, and I seem to remember showing that most of your verses were either taken out of context or were quoted to mean something different than what the original Greek meant. You must rebutt that to win this debate.<br>
<br>
And finally, I must say that this method of debate is extremely self-defeating. There is no way I can answer all of those questions in one paragraph. Also, welcome back whitetigress, I been prayin for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whitetigress2004>whitetigress2004</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;><b>The Poet</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#B87333>(12/16/03 11:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Affirmative Case #1</span><hr size=1> As far as the verses your &quot;showing that most of your verses were either taken out of context or were quoted to mean something different than what the original Greek meant&quot;, I simply shrugged those off as other's opinions, and they are, because i can easily pull up people who say the exact opposite of the few verses you used as examples:<br>
&quot;Both remission and forgiveness are the English translation of the single Greek noun aphesis or verb aphiemi. Thus, both forgiveness and remission mean the same thing. The root meaning of these words is to 'send away or dismiss;' eis aphesin hamartion, in Acts 2:38, i.e., submit to the rite in order to be forgiven; Acts 2:38 says to be baptized for (eis) the remission of sins. This Greek word can only mean &quot;for the purpose of;&quot;  Mark 16:16-'Believeth' and 'baptized' are joined by 'and' which grammatically shows Jesus is placing equal importance on belief and baptism, which are conditions to: 'shall be saved.'&quot;<br>
<br>
 We see the story of saul and ananias in the Bible presented as follows: Act 9:1 And Saul... 3 ...came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 5 And he said, who art thou, Lord? and the lord said, I am Jesus... Act 9:6...Lord, what wilt *thou* have me to do? And *the lord said* unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou **must** do. Act 22:12 ...Ananias... 13 ...said unto me, Brother Saul... 16 ...why tarriest thou? arise, and be *baptized*, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.<br>
<br>
Notice that the Lord (Jesus) told saul that ananias would tell him what he MUST do, and Ananias tells Saul to be baptized. <br>
<br>
Thank you for the welcome and the prayers, darkmast :)<br>
