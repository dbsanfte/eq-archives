ITA with this - why is it so hard to understand that some people just don't believe in any gods?? We aren't turning away from any gods, because we don't believe any exist...that is like saying that every time you walk through your front door, you are turning your back on the pink dragon inside your house - it just doesn't work.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why does there have to be an bad experience for me not to believe in god. I can always remember not believing. It has nothing to do with my experience with religion. That is such a copout to say that we must be damaged in some way not to believe. We just don’t plain and simple.&quot;<br>
<br>
ITA with this also - I've not had any bad experiences with religion - I've *never* believed in a god, for as long as I can remember.  The whole idea just makes no sense to me at all - I truely cannot fathom how people can believe in a god...simple as that. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.growthspurts.com/drivee/images/434360233606.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bonbon2d>bonbon2D</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Apologist in Training</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/23/03 3:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=126.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.iambornagainru.org/bab/Avatars/cm09.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Bad Times = More Religion?</span><hr size=1> ...And the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>important</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> word in my statement would be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>some</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, that is, not everyone...therefore pretty sure that wouldn't apply to you DL or anyone else who makes the same claims as you.  <br>

<br>
If you've chosen not to believe out of your own knowledge instead of allowing an excuse like tragedy in our lives to be a cop-out for religion, then at least you've gone about it in a way that I can respect!<br>

<br>
ITA with Candy here. We often lament that theists assume we are atheists due to some trajedy or negative experience with religion or a priest, when this is rarely the case--hard to turn around and use negative experiences as an excuse to not believe then. The problem with most modern western folks is that we think any god is automatically good and loving when even a cursory reading of even the OT should wipe that notion right out of our heads!! <br>
<br>
On the subject of reaction to tragedy I have to say I think it usually drives religious people deeper into their faith. Isn't that one of the main features of faith is for explanations of the unfathomable and the numbing effect? (Okay crowd control too, but that's more for those holding power than the masses themselves). Gosh, take tragedy and suffering away and there's really not much left to believe in anymore&gt;D<br>

<br>
I don't see it as &quot;an excuse&quot; but as strong evidence that there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a god, certainly not an all-loving god.  If god exists, he can't possibly be all loving when you look at all the awfulness of the world he supposedly made. (As Gaia points out, the OT is pretty clear that he's not always been characterized as all-loving.) <br>
<br>
But this sentimentalized sweetie-pie Jesus character IS supposed to be all-loving. Yet bad things happen continually to us in this imperfect world he supposedly created for us. If it's not legitimate to even <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>question</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that, then how come all of you Christians are constantly trying to cover for this theological shortcoming by proclaiming that all the bad that happens is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the Lord's way of teaching us lessons</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - or bringing us to our knees to make us more teachable or more dependent on him?<br>

Our choices? So, these 2.6 million people starving in Africa right now just made &quot;poor choices&quot;? No, wait, you're right Shirene. I get it now. They are suffering the &quot;natural consequences&quot; of their own &quot;poor choices&quot; to be born into a land of drought, flooding and lousy dictatorship. That's what they've chosen with &quot;their agency.&quot;  <br>

As a mother, can you imagine watching your baby starve to death? God has great self control to just let this stuff happen... as long as it doesn't &quot;interfere with His work&quot; he's fine with it. He's letting them &quot;live and learn from their own choices and consequences.&quot; Now I see.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Lord Works In Mysterious Ways His Wonders To Perform.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>

<br>
I don't use tragedies as the reason for questioning God's existence, but they are definitely a factor.  I used to be more of a believer in God eventhough I always had my skepticism and issues with organized religion.  When I had my miscarriage I really thought God was punishing me.  If anything, I had more faith during that time because I of how strongly I believed this.  Then again, I wasn't really myself when that happened, and I know now that I was being irrational, especially since I've never done anything in my life that warrants the pain of losing a child.  Unlike this so called God, I've never taken the life of someone else's child.  When it comes to my recent tragedy, nothing has changed for me when it comes to beliefs.  I came to the conclusion that I was agnostic well before this happened, and I still hold to that.  I actually find more comfort in knowing that this wasn't part of anyone's conscious effort.  It just happened.  It wasn't done to test our faith, and it wasn't done to punish any of us.  I have not waivered despite all of this.  I know that other people do.  Some people take on a stronger belief because they can't grasp that things in life just happen for no good reason.  Some people totally lose faith at that point because they are pissed that God wasn't their servant who would look out for every aspect of their particular life while ignoring those starving children in Africa.  These are the range of emotions people go through, and since God is an integral part of their life, then that is who they take their frustrations out on.  I choose to just deal with what happened instead of using some deity as my punching bag.  I don't believe this accident happened because I've taken the agnostic route.  Why punish my sister for this?  Why punish her passenger who is still in a coma?  They weren't martyrs for other people to look at their faith.  I also don't think they were martyrs for us to learn some lesson.  My miscarriage did teach me that a healthy baby isn't something to take for granted, but I don't think that child's life was taken just for me to learn this.  I think I just had the strength within me to stand up and see what I can learn from this on my own.  Life gave me a lemon, and I chose to make lemonade.  I don't think it is devine lemonade, I think it is just a strength I found in myself.  Now that my sister is gone, I'm trying to do the same thing.  God didn't take my sister or my baby in order to get me to appreciate the people in my lives, I just decided to make the best out of a bad situation instead of sitting around whining about my bad luck and yelling at the sky.  I'm not going to turn to a deity like a bottle of anti-depressants and look for a quick fix.  <br>
