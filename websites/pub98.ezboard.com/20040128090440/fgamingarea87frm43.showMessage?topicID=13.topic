<br>
I am a kaleidoscope, <br>
Always changing my appearance. <br>
Maybe you think you’ve seen the real me, <br>
But that claim is false. <br>
Until I wish for you to know my secrets, <br>
Turn your prying glances away. <br>
Again I change, <br>
Slipping from one facade to another, <br>
Hoping to keep my true self <br>
Intact and untainted by the world. <br>
For if that singular true form surfaces, <br>
That which I shield shall shatter. <br>
If my soul breaks into shards, <br>
Never will it be whole again. <br>
Great as my hope may be <br>
For this not to come to pass, <br>
All I can do at the moment is wait. <br>
Centuries come and millennia go – <br>
Eternally I am but a shifting face.<br>
<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fear Is All I Know</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Fathomless shadows sheath my soul,<br>
Ever so slowly stealing my humanity.<br>
Alone in the murky abyss,<br>
Residing within the corners of my mind,<br>
Is that which no other may ever lay eyes upon.<br>
Secretly, in some vain hope of anonymity,<br>
All I know shields itself from the world,<br>
Living in sinister darkness, thriving upon fear,<br>
Leaving me to the frozen bleakness<br>
In which my world is encased.<br>
Knees quaking, I solemnly turn to<br>
No other than that which I fear within myself,<br>
Owing to the darkness my allegiance;<br>
We are as one.<br>
<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mortal Soul</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
What is this feeling within my soul<br>
That makes me feel as though I am not whole?<br>
It feeds upon my heart like a ravenous beast,<br>
Mad in his frenzy 'till his hunger has ceased,<br>
Insatiable appetite demanding what is no longer there<br>
Yet ne'er seeing my spirit, frozen and bare.<br>
<br>
This savage beast in his relentless assault<br>
Cares not whether it is he or I at fault -<br>
If it is he, causing pain borne of harrowed famine,<br>
Or I, enticing him with my heart black with sin:<br>
And so he in his nature and I in mine<br>
Trace a path upon which pain and death intertwine.<br>
<br>
The beast, unable to feed any more,<br>
Abandons my soul, battered and sore:<br>
He now travels the path to find a new soul<br>
Upon which he may feed 'till it's no longer whole,<br>
Not once looking backwards or feeling remorse<br>
For my pain of which he granted the source.<br>
<br>
The cause of my pain is not truly this beast,<br>
Nor his frenzied hunger that has yet to cease;<br>
'Tis the hollow shell that was once my life,<br>
For all it now feels is the blade of a knife<br>
As it begins to carve a new kind of hole<br>
To match the one within me, residing in my soul.<br>
<br>
For you see, this beast is more than he seems:<br>
He represents the failing hope in my dreams.<br>
He is knowledge and logic in the coldest term,<br>
The harsh reality of which making my soul burn...<br>
Since the one whom I love does not feel the same,<br>
And I cannot help but feel my face redden in shame.<br>
<br>
Why is it that Fate has chosen for me<br>
An object of affection that shouldn't be?<br>
Why do I feel such misery? Why does it hurt so?<br>
Why can I not simply let it go?<br>
Perhaps it is because I am but a mere human,<br>
And as such, I can feel love and pain just as you can.<br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#FF99CC;font-family:verdana;font-size:xx-small;">She's got a way about her. I don't know what it is, but I know that I can't live without her.<br>
She's got a way of pleasin'. I don't know why it is, but there doesn't have to be a reason anyway.<br>
She's got a smile that heals me. I don't know what it is, but I have to laugh when she reveals me.<br>
She's got a way of talkin'. I don't know why it is, but it lifts me up when we are walkin' anywhere.<br>
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down; inspires me without a sound. She touches me and I get turned 'round.<br>
She's got a way of showin' how I make her feel, and I find the strength to keep on goin'.<br>
She's got a light around her, and everywhere she goes, a million dreams of love surround her everywhere.<br>
