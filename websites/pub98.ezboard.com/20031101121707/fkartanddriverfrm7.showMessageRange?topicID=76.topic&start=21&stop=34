THere is not alot of people speaking factually. Not to many really can. You can say whatever you like as long as you don't put someones name to it that will defame them because you and everyone else here is putting an OPINION down. THATS MY RULE!!!. I pay for this site out of my own pocket, I should have a right to say my peice as well, you dont have to agree with it, but i bet alot of people wont agree with everything said by others, thats where the word OPINION comes in. Its just that. I write whats near and dear to me, you do the same. You noticed that the past 2 comments are still on here dont you. I could easily fix that, but that is not what the site is about. Its about OPINIONS. My comments on the race last week are my OPINION, my thinking of a situation that I saw unfold in front of me. You were not there and all the facts were not brought out that would add to the case if that was what I was doing,Trying to build a case, but its not. Making haste personal judgements and placing a name or person to it towards me or anyone else about there OPINIONS they state on here is unjust and uncalled for. Understand SkYWARD, you dont know alot the facts, you cant, you werent sitting in my kart that night. But, as I put my name to my comments, I dont set the parameters of this forum to where you have to, Its a secretive affair for those who wish to stay that way. Because, its opinions. As far as the tech another writer mentioned, the tech question I asked wally burton about was if he was doing the tech and did he have the tools there to do it. Never was a name mentioned, but for the record, the guy i wanted to tech finished behind me in the feature, so i didnt get to tech, since that is illegal. Dont assume things. If you feel guilty, it may hit home for a reason, but dont always assume you know something, you might not be right and give yourself away.And SKYWARD, I pay for this site for KY karters to share and use,but not for people like you to come on here and attack me or others when you insinuate a name to it. So PLEASE, if you dont like the format we have been using here for the past 3 years, then go visit another site and stay off this one, I will leave your comment on here though so others will know why I wrote this statement. Tell 71 hi when you see him real soon, lol <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkartanddriver.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kartndriver>kartndriver</A> at: 10/3/03 7:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> kevin911</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF9300>(10/3/03 7:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkartanddriverfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hey Big Dave</span><hr size=1> Hey Dave, it was good to talk with you the other night, havent seen much of ya this year, my fault mostly. I liked your response, but I got a little confused tho,(thats not hard at times, lol) I know that you do tell what cam is in your motors to the people you build motors for. The guy I race with is a good example. Thats the info that is needed. From there they can degree in the cam to factory specs , valve lash, etc... then change the rings, springs and lifters and go racing for the most part anyway. As far as buying a motor from a reputable builder as opposed to building their own, I whole heartedly agree. But they should learn to maintain the basic maintnance on the motors tho, even though it will affect the motor building community( i do understand it is a living for you) a little if people started performing basic  maint. on their motors. Just a thought and a response to higher teardown pricing. We are going to do some traveling this month each weekend, maybe we will see you soon.

You need to hear this. Kevin, and i do use his name because he is one of the few on here that stands behind his threads with his name, has done more for karting in KY over the past few years than you could ever imagine. You or #71 have not even done 1/10th combined of the promotimg of our sport and to see its advancemnt as he has. A few years ago we didnt have a site to express our feelings, find out race info, get tech tips from Big Dave who is a very professional engine builder and alot of other tips on this site. A few years ago we had one paper that covers car racing that gave a page or 2 to karting, wasnt much, but we did appreciate it. Now Kevin brought a fully dedicated paper to KENTUCKY karting. Thats how I know where the big races are happening. I race at Richmond about 50% of the time and have always pitted somewhere around Kevin and Eddie. I have been in there pits and heard them give info to drivers that was legit and tro make them run faster, alot of the times it was people running in their own class. They have never turned away someone that asked for help. They will and have loaned everything off their trailer to any person that needed it. Sure, Kevin makes driving errors and judgement, he would be the first to tell you so as well, but we all do. I saw Kevin go over to a trailer that was pitted next to him, they were there for the first time, from WV. He gave them and helped them put in a setup for Richmond. How many times have you done that type of stuff skyward. Kevin pays for the site out of his own pocket. Do you? In the paper, he gaves tips to newkarters to make them faster, the tips most karters wont give out. As far as the #71 fued. I was there that night, I was pitted down the aisle from both kevin and 7. 71 charged kevin like a mad bull in front of my pit. He cussed kevin, he screamed at Kevin, he pointed his fingers at Kevin, and Skyward, you want to see professionalism, Kevin never once lifted his voice, took an offensive stance, kevin leaned in to say the things he said so the others couldnt hear, even tho 71 continued to make a big scene. I assume kevin kept his cool for the sake of the kids who were around, because i always think kevin is about the kids. So, dont talk about who is more professional than the other,or who has given more to karting, its not a even close. Sorry Kevin if this offends youm,but I get tired of hearing good peopleget tore down and others not knowing all the facts.

Yes some people do call themselves tech men after sitting through a class at kart week.  However, the tech men at Richmond, along with one of the race promoters, went to Charlotte and spent 3 days getting private tech class from a WKA official.  Whenever something changes this same official calls to let them know.  So it isn't as if it was a one time class at kart week.  They received much more training.  <br>
<br>
You know the job they do is thankless. There is always someone mad no matter what you do...you really can't win.  I think many of the comments on this board testify to that.  If you don't like Richmond, no one is making you race there...go somewhere else.  If you don't want to do that, then try and be part of the solution not the problem.
