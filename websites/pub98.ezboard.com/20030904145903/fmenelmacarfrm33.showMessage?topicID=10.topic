<br>
The Desert Island - Mar Sara's First Age<br>
In the beginning, when Micras was still young and power was still held by lost empires such as the Flying Islands, Hyperborea and Blackrock, Mar Sara wasn't much more than a barren tundra of rock and ice. At this time, the races of Mar Sara were confined primarily to the sturdy Dragons, reclusive Drow and fungal Myconid. Tyrelia has always had Dragons, as far back as anyone can remember. The Drow were rumoured to have been exiles from some long-lost empire, possibly Florencia. Who made their home in the sparse forests that dotted the warmer parts where the forest belts now grow. The Myconids, or Mushroom Men, came up from beneath the ground, probably driven up from the wars then occuring in Hell. They adapted quickly to the cold, damp and dreary weather, preferring though to remain near the caves they came up from.<br>
<br>
For the most part, Mar Sara was ignored during this time. Not surprising when one considers that the island had a population of perhaps 500 for many years. The Flying Islands of Jasonia warred intermitently with other powers, as did Blackrock, and little Mar Sara lay unnoticed. The Drow built temples in the foothils of Tyrelia, but the rest of the races did little to grow, confined due to the island's inhospitable clime. It would remain as such for many years, with nations fading in and out of existence, through wars and great changes, all across the face of Micras. Yet somehow, Mar Sara managed to avoid these early clashes. It wasn't until a force from the beyond came that the island would become the focus of the world's attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Space Marines - Mar Sara's Second Age<br>
They came from an unknown place in the blackest pits of the universe. At first thought to be benevolent dieties come to save their people, the Mar Sarans soon discovered the truth. The Space Marines had come to enslave them, and after them the entire world. Not surprisingly, the invaders showed up wearing masks of kindliness. In the midst of a general peaceful era on Micras, when the Flying Islands, Blackrock, Hyperborea and Shireroth were all flourishing, the Space Marines landed on Mar Sara in their giant Star Arks. Filled to the brim with soldiers, machines and, worst of all, their politicians, they disembarked to an awe-struck audience of natives.<br>
<br>
Claiming &quot;true socialism&quot; and &quot;communal democracy&quot;, they quickly consolidated their control over the small island and established the People's Republic of Mar Sara. In all reality, the PRMS was nothing more than a totalitarian dictatorship. The Chairman, the de facto leader of the Space Marines, adopted the Human name Thomas Hubert. He was Chairman, but he also held supreme command of the Space Marines. The bureaucracy of the PRMS was established through forces votes and clones of Hubert placed in key positions. With a new government in place, the Spaces Marines quickly subjugated the native races and began to change the face of Mar Sara forever.<br>
<br>
The barren isle of tundra was stripped to the bare bones as the land was bulldozed and the Spacers began to build their elaborate domed cities. The great domed city of Tindalos rose out of the flatlands of the northeast. The Spacers capitol of Bjorden appeared in Xulthan, and not long after the great fortress was constructed underground that held the Black Stone weather machine. As their cities grew, the Space Marines began to import more slaves. The native Drow were quickly being work into oblivion and the Dragons had been nearly completely destroyed in the first invasion and were now hiding deep in Tyrelia's labyrinth. The Myconids, naturally reclusive, also fled back into the underground. Without workers to exploit, the Spacers were forced to pump out more clones and bring in slaves from foreign raids.<br>
<br>
Slaves were imported from all corners of Micras; Elves from Tapfer, Dragons from Ashintully, Orcs from Shireroth, Dwarves from Cimmeria, Gnolls from Automatica and even Humans from the Flying Islands and Hyperborea. The list went on and on as the raids grew and the Space Marines demanded more production to fuel their weapons of war. At the same time, the Spacers began to spread their influence on Micras in the first real attempt at an empire. They drew in supporters from the dregs of society, such as Red Storm and Yosh Leninow, both made Comrades of the PRMS. Through these manipulative figures Chairman Hubert spread the influence of the Space Marines across Micras. Many nations, however, were stout to resist. The Flying Islands and Blackrock made a secret pact to defeat the impending onslaught of evil. But they wern't the only ones planning to retaliate. Deep underground, the remnants of free Mar Saran society, were being led to freedom by the long lost Myconids...<br>
<br>
<br>
War of the Assassins - Mar Sara's Third Age<br>
The fungal Myconids, long thought to have forever departed Mar Sara, had indeed been working to liberate the island. In the years since the Space Marine takeover, the Myconids had fled deep into the labyrinthal caverns of underground Micras. During that time, they had travelled hundreds of miles northward, to the newly established People's Republic of Hell. The PRH had finally ended it's war against the deeper pit fiends after centuries of revolutionary war. The Infernals, as the PRH's citizens were termed, were of a similar nature as the Myconids, Drow and Dragons who had been repressed on Mar Sara (neutral chaotic).<br>
<br>
The PRH was a true communist nation, unlike the PRMS, and had fought a long war to win it's freedom. Thus the Myconids had found a potential ally in the Infernals. The mushroom-men brought the Drow and Dragons before the Infernal Chairman, an ancient Abyss Dragon known as the Warrior of the Void ( <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ). With them came other slaves who had been freed by the Mar Saran partisans; Saber Cats, Elves, Orcs and many other races. The rebels pleaded their case before the great Dragon and asked for the PRH's help in liberating the island. Sensing the oncoming threat from the Space Marines, he agreed. What followed was a massive covert operation orchestrated by the partisan Mar Sarans and the Infernals. But this would not see fruition, because elsewhere, others were plotting the demise of the PRMS.<br>
<br>
The Flying Islands and Blackrock had hatched a plan to defeat Chairman Hubert. A frontal offensive would not work against the overwhelming forces of the enemy, so an infiltration operation was required to take Hubert out. It was believed that if Hubert were assassinated, the entire Space Marine empire would collapse. Blackrock's intelligence operations, far superior to anything else Micras had at the time, quickly infiltrated what the Spacers considered an &quot;impenetrable defense network&quot;. Utilising spies, defectors and the best of the best, the Blackrockians and Flying Islanders launched their strikes on Mar Sara. So soon was the strike, that PRH forces had only just been mobilised when the first spy offensive began.<br>
<br>
The assassinations moved back and forth. Hubert knew he was being targeted, but by whom or what, he could not pinpoint. Clones were attacked and destroyed, and Blackrockian spies captured and tortured to death. The conflict quickly proved itself to be a war of assassins. It quickly became evident that the war had ebbed into a full stalemate. Publicly, hostilities remained formal and diplomatic. But under the guise of special operations, the war raged full on, with assassinations, sabotage and subterfuge being the norm between the opposing sides. Nonetheless, neither side managed to achieve any significant victory over the other. This would quickly change when a Jasonian master spy, known as the Night Assassin, entered the picture.<br>
<br>
The Night Assassin, whose real name is still classified in the secret vaults of Thalassa, was an exceptional master spy. He quickly infiltrated the ranks of the Space Marines, penetrating deeper than any other spy had yet gotten. As information from Hubert's inner circle passed back to Allied Command in Blackrock, it was discovered that the PRH, allied with rebel Mar Sarans, was still planning a revolutionary counter-attack against the PRMS. The Allies quickly pushed their plans forward in anticipation of beating the Communists to the fight. The Night Assassin, aka Assassinite, quickly gained the support of the egotistical Chairman Hubert, becoming on of his top aides. Biding his time and remaining patient, the time came when Hubert finally let his guard down. And that was when the Allies struck with full force.<br>
<br>
As Hubert was giving a speech to his armies a sniper, actually Assassinite, shot him square in the chest from a distance. His troops, in a laid-back stance for the speech, were not expecting any such thing to occur. What followed was complete disarray and anarchy. Hubert's clones rushed in to claim the empty &quot;throne&quot; in their equally egotistical greed. At the same time, the general's of his army factionalised and civil war began to ensue. But bjust as the island was about to be ripped apart by such a Spacer Civil War, Allied forces invaded en-masse. The Flying Island's elite airfleet of Omen subspace jetfighters engaged the Space Marines orbital fleet and took out their air support in the largest air battle ever seen on Micras. The Allied Army landed their immense fleet in North Mar Sara and engaged the Spacer armies, bathing the shore in blood and turning the sea red.<br>
<br>
In South Mar Sara, the Space Marines and even the Allies were caught off-guard when an invasion force from the PRH detonated explosives underground, opening several fissures into the earth out of which poured Infernal and Rebel forces. The hellish speed with which they had moved through the underground tunnels shocked even the Jasonians. But it kept the Allies attention for only a short moment, for soon after the PRH had broken through they were back fighting the remnants of the Spacers once again. Though unaligned and obviously of opposing ideals, the PRH and it's Rebel Mar Saran associates never attacked the Allies. Instead, both forces directed their rage against the Space Marines - and utterly annihilated them.<br>
<br>
The great domed cities lay cracked and burning. Tindalos was nothing more than a pile of charred steel and blackened bodies. Sacremento, the Spacer capitol, lay in utter anarchy. Hubert's Imperial Palace was in flames and rioters lined the streets as chaos consumed the land. What remained of the Space Marines army was destroyed, and it's civilian population captured and sent to detention camps. The race to occupy Sacremento quickly followed. For whoever occupied the capitol would gain control of all Mar Sara. Thus Infernaland Allied forces clashed anxiously against eachother as the raced forward across Mar Sara for Sacramento. Ultimately, the Allies beat the Infernals and captured the capitol, raising the flag of victory high atop the remnants of Hubert's palace. The Infernals retreated back into the depths of Micras from whence they came. And the remnants of Mar Sara that had allied with them were forced to recognise new overseers; the Flying Islands of Jasonia and the new Mar Saran Governor, Assassinite.<br>
<br>
<br>
Darkness and Xulthan - Mar Sara's Fourth Age<br>
The new Governor of Mar Sara did little to ease the burdens of dictatorship, although the island was marginally less dictatorial than under the Space Marines. The remaining Spacers were allowed a home in Ithaqua, who quickly managed to rebuild the crumbling dome-city of N'Gai. The rebels that had aligned with the Infernals were, despite their affiliations, allowed to return to their homes and lands. Among the settlers were the multitude of former slaves and soldiers who had decided to stay on the island after the war. Sacramento was maintained as the provincial capitol, but quickly dwindled from it's former glory. Once again, Mar Sara began to slip into obscurity.<br>
<br>
Assassinite took the &quot;public&quot; name of Governor Nordman and proceeded to run the island as, more or less, a military base of the Flying Islands. A large airport was established for the immense Omen fighters to land on and several laboratories established to study Spacer technology. Although Governor Nordman made little efforts to improve the domestic affairs of Mar Sara, he made many tries to decipher the technology left behind by the Spacers. Those that had been resettled in Ithaqua knew nothing of it, except the most basics of the language. They had never been part of Hubert's Technomages. The Jasonians even went as far as to assign the reknowed Omen design team from JASO (Jasonian Aeronautics and Science Organisation) to study the vast ruins at Sacremento. But even with all that help, the FIoJ could not crack the encryptions on the vast weather machine.<br>
<br>
With the war over and scientists stumped by Spacer technology, world focus shifted elsewhere. Other evils had arisen to take the place of the Space Marines; Blackrock went into a cold war with the Atterans, the Flying Islands went into a similar one with the Infernals. Across Micras, other civilizations were appearing from out of the darkness. Mar Sara's popularity and status as a cultural icon quickly faded, and even the Flying Islands soon came to ignore it's colony. The island itself slipped from rebuilding to apathy, as many of the new settlers packed up their belongings and left for other, more prosperous lands. Mar Sara wallowed in what many would consider a great depression.<br>
<br>
As the population on Mar Sara waned, so did it's development. The scarred battlefields and ghost towns gave way to nature's embrace as forests sprang up on a profusion of green and jungles spread over the eastern lands of Shala. Even the once prestigous Mar Saran capitol of Sacramento whitled down to a mere village as swamps spread over Xulthan. A dark pallow cast itself over the entire island as nature roared in her dominance. Thus Mar Sara remained for many years in the darkness and out of Micras' eyes. Little did the world know that deep underground, other forces were hard at work building weapons of war, with their eyes set on the old island.<br>
<br>
<br>
Infernal Cats - Mar Sara's Fifth Age<br>
Years passed, and the elders of Micras faded away in favour of the new generations. No more were the Flying Islands, Blackrock and PRH. All had waged immense wars, fought bravely and then disappeared into the night. Of course, the people of these nations were still around in abundance. The Flying Islanders and Blackrockians had gone off to build new nations, such as Treesia and Menelmacar. And the Infernals populated numerous lands; Cimmeria, Ashintully, Automatica, Teir'Dal, and so on. Other nations, comprised of one-time minorities, also appeared. The Hubertian Successor States, such as the People's United Republic and Kalatonia appeared. Babkha, Tymaria and Attera became bitter rivals and many other small states dotted the map.<br>
<br>
As time passed, the wars of ages long passed faded into legends and folklore. Many people forgot about the Infernals and the dungeons deep below Micras. And especially the tunnels carved from the rock leading to Mar Sara. The Myconids, the long-lost race of the PRH, still thrived in these underground wastes. In the north, the eruption of Mount Yannek in Hyperborea sent ash and dust spewing out across the northern hemisphere. The lands now known as Ashintully, but at this time belonging to the PRH, were directly east of Yannek, and thus in it's path of destruction. Above-ground Hell was nothing like it's underdark counterpart. Ashintully was sparesley settled and inhabited by a wide variety of legendary creatures. Among these were the reknowned Saber Cats.<br>
<br>
Now, driven from their homes in the lush northern forests by the impending dark clouds, the Saber Cats fled to Gehenna and the tunnel which leads to the underworld of the PRH. Once in the tunnels, the Saber Cats travelled to the Infernal capitol of Dagora, buried deep below Micras. Here they came face-to-face with the ancient Dragon, WarVoid. They explained their plight to the great old one and asked what the PRH might do for them. It was revealed unto the cats that the Infernals had never given up their claims to Mar Sara, despite their explusion from the island. The Myconids, which had not returned but instead settled underground, had also been working to liberate the island from the oppressive bourgeoise. Thus the cats and Infernals had a common objective in mind.<br>
<br>
The Myconids guided the Saber Cats, who had now aligned themselves with the PRH, underground and through the tunnels which led from Dagora to Myconia, the mushroom-men's labyrinthal home. In Myconia they met with other members of a provisional Mar Saran Revolutionary Council, comprised mainly of Drow, Dragons and other natives of the island. Assembling an army in Myconia, the cats trained the Mar Sarans in the arts of warfare. After all, the Saber Cats were a society of warriors. The cats also held another advantage in the impending revolution, they were unknown to the occuping Treesian and Shirerithian empires.<br>
<br>
After months of training and preperation, the Saber Cats launched their attack. From the Tyrelian caves issued forth massive numbers of feline warriors. Quickly they spread out across the Shalan jungles, establishing a base of operations and, ultimately, what would eventually become their new homeland. The first wave pounded the insignificant defenses on Mar Sara, remnants of the Nordman Era were smashed and the island was nearly occupied before Shirerithian forces quickly paradropped and airborne team onto the northern plains of Jacurutu. At the same time, the PRH was reformed by the WarVoid and launched similar attacks against several former Infernal lands.<br>
<br>
The largest war to hit Micras since the first Infernal War seemed almost inevitable. The remnants of the Purple Bunny Federation were quickly absorbed into the land empire of Berkistan (Berkshire Yardistan) while underground Infernal armies sprung up in lands such as Norfolk, Paramount, Cimmeria and Automatica. Hellish armies clahsed with forces from Treesia, Audentior and Shireroth. The most heavy fighting, however, was done with the Shirerithians, whom held large stretches of formerly-Infernal lands. The Shirerithians were forced to divert their armies to many points, thus denying them any vantage point. It was at this time when the great warrioress, TeMorna, leader of the Saber Cats, smashed Sacremento with the bulk of the Cats forces.<br>
<br>
The Infernal Dragon, being one of the Great Old Ones, provided the knowledge which allowed TeMorna to access the long-silent Space Marine facilities and the reknowed Black Stone at Sacramento. With control of the Black Stone in the hands of the Infernals, the Shirerithians could do nothing but watch as the rest of Mar Sara fell to the revolutionaries. Likewise, Treesia forces were forces to give way and move back to safer havens. With Mar Sara, liberated by, as the Shirerithians and Treesians dubbed them &quot;Infernal Cats&quot;, the island was finally restored to a people's council led by the true Mar Sarans.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for the PRH, other battlefields were not faring so well. The withdrawl from Mar Sara allowed the Shirerithians to redeploy a large amount of their forces. Infernal armies were forced to retreat entirely from Automatica, and were forced out of all Cimmeria except for the capitol of Valhalla. The Treesians had since declared non-beligerency and made a pact of neutrality excluding themselves from further conflict in the war. Unable to reinforce the former lands of the Purple Bunny Federation, now known as Brussina, that land along with Temoe, Gehenna and Berkistan all remained held by the Infernals.<br>
<br>
After the loss of Mar Sara and the withdrawl of Treesia, the war between Shireroth and Hell cooled considerably. Fighting in Cimmeria had utterly stalemated, as both sides fortified their positions and refused to make any advances. Brussina, Gehenna, Proletaria, Temoe and Berkistan united to form the Infernal Knightship of Ashintully. Norfolk, which was an original part of the PRH, was lost to the Shirerithians who managed to sneak a blitzkrieg strike on the old republic.  Elsewhere, a Hubertian successor state known as Varja had sprung up, founded by a clone of Hubert known as General El Dorni, one of the old Spacer generals. Varja had attempted to hold elections, but was soon thrown into civil war, which led to the foundation of the Imperium of Menelmacar. A nation which would have a key role to play in the upcoming affairs of Micras...<br>
<br>
<br>
Twisted Fates - Mar Sara's Sixth Age<br>
Menelmacar grew by such standards and speed that it defied all previous countries on Micras. What was even more startling was that most of this was done peacefully. At the same time, Varja shrank andpractically disappeared except to be a small, perennial thorn in the side. Menelmacar, under the leadership of Varjan exile and now Elenaran Sirithil Nos Feanor, the Imperium quickly gained numerous infamous citizens and absorbed the lands that went along with them; Elpidos, Freenesia, Balar and Jaiha. Not to mention the original sylvan lands of the country, which included the Drow homeland of Teir'Dal and the island chain of Caras Menelmacar. The Imperium had become the world's largest nation, rivaling even the great powers of Treesia, Shireroth and Attera.<br>
<br>
As the war between Shireroth and the PRH waned in stalemate, the Dragon WarVoid saw an opportunity in the newly formed and extremely expansionist Menelmacar. After travelling from the Marble Palace to Caras Menelmacar, the Dragon opened secret negotiations with the Elven Elenaran, Sirithil. In return for protection against outside threats, the Infernals would join the Imperium. It was agreed to, and the PRH, including Mar Sara, were absorbed by Menelmacar as the Fief of Ashintully. But in addition to the absorbtion of the PRH, Menelmacar also inherited the claims left behind by the Infernals.<br>
<br>
As Menelmacar was, at this time, on generally friendly terms with all nations of Micras, the claims it was forced to uphold did not go well. With pressure from the Menelmacar government, the Infernals were forced to concede to Shirerithian demands that they withdraw from Cimmeria, Automatica and Norfolk. No stipulations, however, were ever made about Mar Sara. Thus the Infernals kept occuping the island while the Shirerithians kept claiming it. Both sides fidgeted back and forth over the issue, with Menelmacar constantly being the middleman.<br>
<br>
The stalemate over the issue continued for many years. The Infernals allowed the Saber Cats to establish their permanent home in the jungles of Shala, where they built magnificent cities high in the trees. And the Myconids, Drow and other races returned to their respective homes on the island. Similarily, the island was given new life as the Priestesses of TeMorna were able to maintain the black stone in secret. The Shirerithians,preoccupied with other matters, simply ignored the ongoings at Mar Sara.<br>
<br>
The islands ownership became a prominent subject again with the ascension of a Human Mage to the throne of Menelmacar. The Arch Elenaran was closely associated with the Infernal, WarVoid, and supported the Dragons moves to officially make Mar Sara a part of the Imperium. The Kaiser of Shireroth quickly moved to defend their claim over the island. And soon enough, the situation was once again nearing a full-scale war. Except this time it would be Menelmacar against Shireroth.<br>
<br>
Once again, a cold war erupted between the two sides, even edging towards hot as troops engaged in limited battles on the open sea between Yardistan, Amity and Mar Sara. Most of the fighting was confined to battles between the Mar Sarans and Shirerithians, rather than the Menelmacari actually becoming directly involved. For months both sides engaged in this limited form of conflict, with the Mar Sarans drawing upon Menelmacari ElfMech technologies to build more powerful weapons and the Shirerithians drawing on old J.A.S.O. technology to build equally powerful war machines.<br>
<br>
The conflict was nearing a boiling point when the Shirerithian Kaiser called for negotiations. For the first time in decades, fighting was culled and a cease-fire signed for the duration of the talks. But the beginning of the negotiations proved futile as neither side was willing to budge on their position of dominion over the isle. The Infernals, despite having a tactical war advantage, were losing groud politically. Pressured by internal and exterior politics, and the Menelmacari government, they were forced to concede to Shirerithian demands.<br>
<br>
Despite having to make concessions, the Infernals refused to cede total dominion of the island to Shireroth. Instead, Shireroth obtained the political dominion of the island, while actual ownership was vested in the Infernals and Mar Sarans themselves. Shireroth agreed to let the Mar Sarans engage in any form of relationship with the Infernals and Menelmacari as they wished. And, should Shireroth ever crumble or disappear under the waves of time, Mar Sara would return to the full dominion of the islanders.<br>
<br>
Thus the two fates, those of Menelmacar and Shireroth, have become twisted together on Mar Sara. Weaving a strange new fabric of society as they embark on a new future that holds many new adventures. Once mortal enemies, the needs of the world have imposed their will on this island and forced these two sides to work as a team. Will it last? Well, that is in the hands of the Gods.<br>
