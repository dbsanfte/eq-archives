<br>
why should he try and get me to believe the way he does when he really just wants me to be happy and vice-versa?<br>
<br>
we both happen to believe that nobody will ever burn in a pit of fire unless we choose to build one in the back yard and jump in.<br>
<br>
this is the reason i believe the mormons are so violently attacked by other christians (and protected for the most part by atheists).  we believe that we will all be individually held accountable for our actions, and that the father of our spirits actually wants to &quot;save&quot; all of his children.<br>
<br>
i can understand not having faith in a god but i can't understand having faith in a loving god that cannot save all of his children or just doesn't want to.<br>
<br>
which is it?<br>
<br>
without attacking my faith can someone tell me why they feel good about all their neighbors and most of asia burning in a lake of fire by a loving god that chose to save only them?<br>

I was amazed when I moved from boston to the south, how terrible catholics were thought of and how they were going to hell  because they werent xian. that bullshit to me. That thinking is what made me think that being a xian isnt as great as I thought. Or at least that no one has the right to say who is a xian and who isnt. The judging and saying Im a better one than you are has made me not want to be catagorized  as a xian anymore.<br>

LDS has the biggest example, but xians have always kicked other xians.  I think it is inherent in the rationale involved.  People beleive because they are raised in their faith (we are all born atheists, we have to be brainwashed into religion) then they have to hold on to their beleifs and to do so means they must justify/defend them when confronted by something that is different, or possibly better.  If you are intrusting your immortal soul into a belief system, you better be certain it is the right one.  It is far easier to decide the one you already know is right and bash down any others than learn them all and pick the best.  <br>
<br>
You are all basing it off the same book.  If there are differences between you, then one of them MUST be more right than the other.  Obviously, it is mine and not yours or all my investment was wasted and my parents were wrong.  It is all based on faith anyway so you can't shake me even if you quote scripture (thankfully there is enuff contradictory fuel that I can quote back and be more right!)  Other faiths aren't sprung from the same book (as directly) so it is easier to just brush them of (crazy foreigners!) as they are less threatening.<br>
<br>
This is where deism discards the bibble and all its flaws.  The argument is that you use what you feel to be gods work (direct, specific work, not inspired or ghost written) as a basis for measure.  For example, the creation.  No one was there, but you can look and see what we have and 'know' god made it.  Elegantly complex, amazingly interdependant, both fragile and indestructable at the same time, truely worthy of wonder.  Based on what you 'know' of his creation, you use that as a standard of measure against anything claiming to be 'revealed' by him.  How can one who hand crafted cellular immune and regenerative systems, phytoplankton and whales interdependance, laws of gravity, relativity and quantum math, sequenced every gene in every organism in the UNIVERSE  screw up a collection of essays so that they don't even agree with each other?<br>
<br>
Answer: it isn't gods work.  It is a product of mankind. <p>DBC67<br>

I have no idea why people need to change what other people think about religion. Try to save people. I have a real problem with missionaries. I think its like a crack dealer going to the poorest neighborhood and saying &quot;take this crack this is the only way you will ever get out of this life&quot;.

It is when the different faith or lack thereof attracts those who 'could be one of us' that people start to get punchy. And its not just Christians who do it, conflicts between sects exist in Judaism, Islam, and other religions as well. <br>
<br>
Back in the 1920's the KKK in west-central Wisconsin didn't have many Jews or Blacks to persecute, but dem der Catholics sure came in handy for cross-burnings and intimidation.  I doubt the person lighting the cross gave a hoot about the salvation of their victem, or really thought they would change their beliefs. <br>

<br>
Well the first thing it does to hurt is reinforce what is called tribalism.  Extending the survival instinct to a group or population based on ideals and lessening the other 'tribes' in terms of worth or deservedness.  You are the chosen of god, so it is ok to kill these heathen bastards and take what you need.  See the crusades, the inquisition, the Salem witch burnings, the LDS massacre, 9/11 and just about every other major slaughter ever.  I'd call that hurting someone.<br>
<br>
What missionaries do is subvert indigenous culture and replace it with their own.  No more Hawaiian native faiths, all xians now.  Forget Asgard, we have heaven.  Lose that deceitful Summerhome, it is reeeeealy heaven you seek.  We lose the art, the language, the wonderful diversity, and all because xians feel it is their duty to crush everything in their War Santa’s name.  &quot;Yes, we will give you water, but it will be in the fountain outside our church.&quot;  Never mind that they only collected up the naturally present water supplies, depleting the other reservoirs and eliminating competition.  Never mind that the proximate property relationship of the water at the church dragging members in for survival.  Never mind that they had wonderful elaborate culture and creative legends that are now heresy and quashed for the sake of xianity.<br>
<br>
There are presently 5,600 languages (approximately) in the world.  Within the next 100 years it is expected that number will reduce to 500.  What a loss for us all.<br>
<br>
One other question, if you were brainwashed, how would you know?<br>

i'm just curious how anyone can be happy having faith in basically total condemnation that we are all village idiot sinners and deserve to burn for eternity?<br>
<br>
it gives me hope knowing that i am a child of god (a.k.a. a baby god learning the ropes) capable of anything.  that may not be the case but at least i am trying to understand and reach my full potential instead of trying to escape fire and brimstone.  the only &quot;proof&quot; i need is to look around me at how awesome people are (especially DBC)<br>
<br>
simply put my faith makes me happy and i'd share it with anyone willing to listen but i don't feel they will burn if they don't accept my faith.  they will just have a little catching up to do and more to learn once they die and don't know where they are and i'd be willing to teach it to them at that time as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhinosmom>rhinosmom</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://mjkingbird.homestead.com/files/paige.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/3/03 11:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: salvation or condemnation???</span><hr size=1> Not all missionaries are like that.

The church owns lots and lots of property for use as welfare farms. Volunteers work those farms and produce food to be given away to those in need. It's called the right thing to do. <p>Paige<br>

Nor can I, but I think the other sects are attacking the very odd, traditionally non-xian parts LDS added with their new gospels like god once being a man, spirit babies, men becoming gods and having spirit families on other planets, secret marital names where they guy knows his wifes (or wives) so he can call her if he feels like it in the afterlife but she doesn't know his, blood atonement--it's all very L.Ron Hubbard/Raelian sounding and the fact that you don't want to darn everyone to heck for not agreeing with some strain of biblical fundamentalism just puts the cherry on that cupcake.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
my original question actually came when my manager at work asked me if i knew where i was going once i died.  i asked him why it mattered to him and he said because if you don't accept jesus as your personal savior then you can't be saved.<br>
<br>
i tried not to argue with him but the 2 minute conversation that we did have seamed to last an hour.  to keep the tension down at the office i decided to post my question here instead of asking him directly about how he could put so much faith in condemnation.<br>
<br>
i wish the whole world would just say they are saved when confronted and then leave it up to the born-agains to decide who's telling the truth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=powertotherae>Powertotherae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/3/03 12:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: They think you're too weird and nice</span><hr size=1> &quot;i wish the whole world would just say they are saved when confronted and then leave it up to the born-agains to decide who's telling the truth. &quot;<br>

<br>
Not all xians are racists either.  The purpose of missionary work is to bring xianity to the lost.  You are on a 'mission from god' just like the blues brothers.  What you describe is not missionary, but charity.  Very different and something I also partake in.  Mission work is by definition, taking the message to other people.  Typically uninvited at that and definately a form of cultural errosion.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;everyone including atheists does what &quot;feels&quot; right&quot;<br>
<br>
I also have to respond to this.  I do what I think is right, not because of a feeling I get about it, but rather because of empirical evidence and reason.  I do not give because I expect something in return, even if it is a passive 'you'll have good luck' chain mail type thing.  I give because I know those who receive need it.  I do not respect my parents because I fear eternal damnation, but because my parents were loving and generous and worthy of my respect.  I do not remain faithful to my wife because I will be excommunicated if I ever divorce; I do it because we were very careful in our selection and planning and we are well matched, healthy and good for each other.  We may all be diong something for how it feels, but he reasons for why it feels that way are VERY different.<br>

My mom (agnostic) did this. Someone asked her if she'd &quot;found her personal saviour&quot; and she answered &quot;Yes, as a matter of fact I have!&quot; and then quickly changed the subject.

I find it very disturbing that  your manager at work approached you about this. I do not find it professional. I think its down right wrong. I am suspicious by nature and I would very much wonder why he asked such a question (he/she/it). It does not have a place in the work force between manager and underling, IMO.<br>

no kidding.  i'm not going to push it though since he is an understanding and pretty nice guy overall.  if he brings it up again i will tell him how i feel about being approached unprovoked.<br>
<br>
i share my beliefs at work when people ask how i feel about a particular topic so i don't mind that as much as being asked such a pointed question without really wanting to divulge the answer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dbc67@religiousdebate60574>DBC67</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/3/03 2:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: They think you're too weird and nice</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>DBC, we do all those things for the same reasons - Paige  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I would not presume to speak about why something is done for Atheists everywhere, only for myself.  Yet if as you say, xians everywhere do these things for the same reasons I do, why then would the concept of hell, sin, punishment or commandments ever even come up?  You cannot truely say that you do unless you don't beleive in them, otherwise it is questionable. <p>DBC67<br>
