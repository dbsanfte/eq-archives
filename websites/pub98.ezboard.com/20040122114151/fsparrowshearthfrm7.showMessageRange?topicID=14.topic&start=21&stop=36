How about what Our Lord tells us in Matthew 5:16<br>
<br>
&quot;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.&quot;<br>
<br>
Glorify 'your' Father, not 'their' Father! Then, when they do you glorify Our Father, say 'Thank God', for instance, you can ask if they know His Son, Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Our Lord tells us:  &quot;No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;<br>

<br>
I would not put anyone 'on the spot' as far as this is concerned, so yes I agree with Wearynot, it isn't a matter of secrecy for me either.  I know it has all sparked an interest for me, I'm reading &quot;The Story of Christianity&quot; by Justo L. Gonzalez.  I'm not a big history buff, so it's slow going for me reading, which is weird since I usually fly through books.  It is good though, and was recommended to me by some seminary students here in Louisville.  There has been a lot of information in the book about monasticism.  About Benedict and &quot;THE RULE&quot; he instated, for the rotation of jobs in the monastery.  It's interesting too that there were several different 'kinds' of monks.  I never knew that way back when you had to go through a sort of discipleship before you could be baptized that lasted 3 years?   Anyway, it's off subject somewhat, but I found it interesting.<br>
Plus I've got a load of websites to go through.  There's a lot of strange stuff out there though, and sorting through it is interesting to say the least. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I do not know that knowing every nuance the Bible contains is a requirement, but I want to know what can be known and study it.  I've told Heartjoys, when we met, that time has to be part of the answer,  I know from what the Bible says that God KNOWS, is omniscient.  I accept that and all it entails, so I can know that HE knows what choices I will make.  Maybe it's like a play, I've not been given the script, just the mood/tone to play, and the gifts and talents to perform.  And though I'm winging it here on earth, it is in conjunction with what the script calls for?  So much for being a theologian/philosopher. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm not saying I've got it down pat either, just that it makes sense to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :tk --><img src=http://www.geocities.com/bat3193/smiley8/thk.gif ALT=":tk"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't understand?  Maybe I didn't express it correctly.  What I decide or accept doesn't mean that it's God adjusting to me?  Would it be more acceptable to say that because God is eternal and timeless, I discover as I walk through this time, what was written/commanded/ordained/decreed in a logical succession by God?  Since HE knows the whole story, I can only discover what my part is in that story?  I don't add to God's knowledge, but HE adds knowledge/discovery to me in this timeline.<br>

 <br>
Is it possible that two conditions are operative with respect to the will, or won't, of man.  <br>
<br>
First.  The awakening, accepting, believing condition of man.  <br>
-  Awakening to the fact that God is.<br>
-  Accepting that God is the creator.<br>
-  Believing that God sent His only begotten Son to save us, spiritally.<br>
<br>
Due to His omnipotence, God knows who will awaken, accept and believe so that, when belief appears, God will have it pre-arranged to give each one the opportunity to accept or reject the salvation offer.<br>
<br>
Second.  The repenting, learning, obeying condition.<br>
-  repenting and accepting the salvation.<br>
-  learning that now it is God's will, not our own, that we should be seeking to do.<br>
-  obeying what He has tells us, in His word, under ALL circumstances. <br>
<br>
Due to His great love, God will forgive those who repent, have His Holy Spirit work to show them God's will, then bring blessings and/or tribulations upon them for the purpose of 'refining' them in order to mold them and make them 'sons of God', with their wills completely subservient to His. <br>
<br>
We know that 'eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man the things God has prepared for those who love Him'.  I think the part believers will have in those things will depend on how deeply each one has loved God during their physical lifetime.<br>
<br>
Those who do not awaken, accept and believe will not have any part in the things that God has prepared for those who love Him.<br>
<br>

<br>
Considering a broader view of the debate, it has always seemed to me that we argue in two different realms.  One, by viewing the human condition as God does (the God=view) and two, by viewing the human condition as an individual does (the man-view).  The problem for me is allowing myself to contemplate this from God's view.  I find that impossible; for who can fathom the depths of God?  (For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him?  Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 2:11)  <br>
<br>
With that being said, it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>has</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> been pointed out to me that God's plan of predestination is, in fact, completely understandable, I just don't agree with that.<br>
<br>
Wearynot:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>See, that's the rub. I reject a god who views our actions and reacts and makes decisions based on what we do. That is a God constrained by time, subject to it, not commander of it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But how can we view ourselves outside of time/experience?  And, how does &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;prayer&quot; take on meaning if God doesn't interact with us, in time <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>as we view it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>

This is where my view probably differs again- according to my understanding of Reformed theology, this statement would apply to the lost as well as the believer and I do not believe that God predestines anyone to hell.<br>

<br>
If God knows all Heartjoys, how can He not know who will and who will not choose Jesus as their Savior??  I don't know who will, you don't know who will, but HE knows who will or won't.  So while living this timeline, it is still a choice we make?  That HE knows that choice doesn't mean we didn't make it ourselves?  That we need help yes, from God.  Matthew Henry and other people who have written commentaries speak of us 'letting go' so 'God can' lift us up and bring us to Him.  Putting off our filthy rags so we stand naked and HE clothes us.  And I love Revelation 3:20-21 Rev 3:20  Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. <br>
Rev 3:21  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>To him that overcometh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.<br>
 <br>
Reformed Theology will be wrong if it takes away man's responsibility to God.  I think they stress that man has a responsibility to God but that man by himself can not attain, it is not what he does but what he relinquishes, if that makes sense?<br>
<br>
So the person who overcomes overcomes by God's grace, and faith is given, but to be given these things a person must empty themselves?<br>
2Titus 2:19-21<br>
19  Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. <br>
20  But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. <br>
21  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, [and] prepared unto every good work. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
That a person chooses to not empty themselves has to be a part of God's plan?   This is from eternity's standpoint, here on earth, during this time we don't know which is which and who will or won't.  So until they are dead, there is always a chance?  But it will have been that it was part of God's plan.<br>
<br>
God bless,<br>

That's a kicker, to be sure.  I wrestled with that in a mighty way.  But there is Scripture that shuts my mouth...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Rom 9:20   Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it], Why hast thou made me thus?  <br>

    Rom 9:23   And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I know we've discussed this Scripture before.  I cannot remember how we reconciled it.  <br>
<br>
I dealt with it this way.  When I come upon a scene that I know little about, and I observe something without full knowledge of the situation, I should or can not make a judgement about what I am witnessing.  <br>
<br>
For example I come upon a woman spanking her child in public.  I am outraged.  I am indignant.  I am inclined to yank her hair out.  But the truth of the matter is, I have no idea what the dynamic of the situation is.  <br>
<br>
I liken that to my understanding of Romans 9.  God is sovereign.  I am not.  He is in control.  I am not.  He knows His plan, I do not.<br>
<br>
I am satisfied, fully and completely, that my God knows what He is about.  Knows what His sovereign will is.  Knows what the outcome of this temporal life is. I do not.

<br>
WOW! You expressed that so concise and complete!<br>
<br>
I went and read the verses in my NAS and the NIV.. both have a bit different reading.. but it's pretty darn close.<br>
<br>
The main difference is the use of &quot;dishonor&quot;. Both of the other versions have &quot;common&quot; for the use...So some of God's &quot;pots&quot; are for noble use, and some for common use. That fits with we're all part of one Body, but each has different gifts and different functions... right?<br>
<br>
The more troubling, for me, is verse 22.. the part about being &quot;prepared for destruction&quot;.<br>
<br>
Ok.. this is what I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>think</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> how it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>might</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be reconciled.<br>
<br>
When something is &quot;prepared&quot;, it's getting or made ready. Not necessarily that it was specifically created for that purpose. When I'm going for surgery, I'm &quot;prepared&quot; for the OP.. that doesn't mean, that my original purpose was to be in surgery in the OP. When one is taking an important test, they must be &quot;prepared&quot;. When someone dies, their body is &quot;prepared&quot; for burial.<br>
<br>
The vessels that the Potter makes are, some for noble purposes, some for common. Some of these vessels will be made ready for distruction. Not that they were created for distruction. Potters don't go through the whole process of creating something merely to smash it. But, sometimes things go wrong in the kiln, and they break, or have flaws that are too pronounced that they must be destroyed.<br>
<br>
Does that make sense?<br>
<br>
I just really, REALLY have trouble thinking that God makes some start out with no chance of forgiveness. Jeremiah has one of the verses I've always loved, and held onto for those I love that are not believers.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.<br>
And <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>you will see Me and find Me when you search for Me with all you heart</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
~jeremiah 29: 12-13<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> There's another in 1 Chronicles<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;...serve Him with a whole heart and a willing mind; for the Lord searches all hearts, and understands every intent of the thoughts. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>If you seek Him, He will let you find Him</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever&quot;<br>
~1 chronicles 28: 9<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->and finally, from Lamentations<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;This I recall to my mind,<br>
Therefore I have hope.<br>
The lord's lovingkindnessess indeed never cease,<br>
For His compassions never fail.<br>
They are new every morning;<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness.<br>
'The Lord is my portion,' says my soul,<br>
'Therefore I have hope in Him'.<br>
The Lord is good to those who wait for Him,<br>
To the person (soul) who seeks Him.&quot;<br>
~Lamentations 3: 21-25<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I believe that God knows who will/not search Him out, who will respond to His call.

Amen!  I agree too....how is this view different from what you believed before?<br>
<br>
'vessels of wrath prepared for destruction' is the crux of the verses you quoted...<br>
<br>
Some folks believe that man prepares himself for destruction and God is long-suffering and patient for man's repentance, others believe God has made them specifically for destruction;  orchestrated them for His purposes.  My problem with the latter is that this would seem to negate man's responsibility for himself and his evil deeds. ie, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>God</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has fitted him for destruction rather than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Man</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has fitted himself for destruction.<br>

I think that is the case.  I do not think God prepares anyone for destruction.<br>
<br>
I do think, once a person has turned themselves, body and soul, over to the Lord that God will prune and prepare that one for a role in the body of Christ.  <br>
