He and his mother hadn't been getting along so he decided to leave home. He stopped off in Sim City because he had a friend there named Kevin that owned a comic book shop and said he'd give Jay a place to stay.<br>
<br>
IC: Jay woke up in the storage room with Kevin proding him with a baseball bat.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell man....&quot; Jay said grogily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bad news bro.&quot; said Kevin.<br>
<br>
Jay looked to his friend as if to ask what.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your mom found out you were staying here.<br>
<br>
Jay's eyes widened with anger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Instead of sending the cops after you she signed you custody of you over to me and she enrolled you into Sim City High.&quot; Kevin continued, &quot;I gotta go downtown and sign some papers so don't get into trouble now cause it's gonna be my ass on the line from now on.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks a lot man. I'll try to be good, anything to get away from that bitch of a mother of mine.&quot; Jay replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright thanks, it's no problem, you're almost like my little brother anyway. Oh @#%$, it's 10:30 in the morning, go to school right now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jay looked at him angrilly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jay, don't give me that look. I can't let you slack off that much anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;@#%$ man, why you gotta be like that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be like what Jay, responsible? Maybe one day you should try it. You might actually have a purpose.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know what man?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;F*ck you! Why don't you just f*ck off and die!&quot;<br>
<br>
Jay threw on his jacket and stormed out. Even though he had no idea where the school was, he used his intuition and sense of direction to find his way.<br>

Cassandra walked into the store, and smiled as she walked in. She looked over to the guy on the register and smiled, he was the one with the rich blood. She sauntered over to a book rack, and casually looked over some, knowing the whole time, the clerks eyes were somewhere they shouldn't be. She turned and saw his head snap back to the register, counting money. She nearly laughed, and walked over to the counter and hopped on.<br>
&quot;Hey,&quot; She said seductively. The man dropped the money. Cassandra, hopped into his little booth, and stared at him, giving him &quot;The look&quot; that had signed the death warrants of hundreds of other men, just like him. His eyes widened, as she motioned towards the back of the store, where there was a rather large storage area. &quot;Want to take your break?&quot; She smiled. He nodded, and walked with her to the back.  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:verdana;font-size:large;">&quot;In the end is my beginning&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

He was across the street.  For a second he scowled at the man.  The thought of him going into the back room with Cassandra made his blood boil, which is something that doesn't happen to a cold blooded vampire very often.<br>
<br>
Then he realized that this was just a game, or so he hoped.  She would soon be feeding on his dead or dying body, gaining strength with his blood and finding what she needed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chococow>Choco Cow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 385<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/3/03 10:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Secret Stash Comic Book Store</span><hr size=1> Cassi looked at the man, and was so glad she found Gabriel, who was perfect, this guy had only seen her ten minutes and already had a hard on for her.

He was starting to like this less and less.  Then he smelt it.  He could smell the scent of the man change... it was one of arrousal.  His love was there, and he could tell that she was the object of this arrousal.  He wouldn't stand for it... not for anything.<br>
<br>
His blood was boiling now, and for a cold blooded vampire, it could take a lot to do that.  His eyes were red with rage and all on the street could tell it.  As he walked across the street, people got out of his way, and cars stoped.  With each step, he left a red hot molten foot print.  Cars that got too close got their bumpers melted.<br>
<br>
He stood in front of the glass door to the comic book store.  He didn't move but just stared at it, and watched it melt away.  Walking through the new opening, his eyes were only on the door to the back room.  Comics were set ablaze as he passed, moving only on rage and love now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chococow>Choco Cow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 389<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/4/03 4:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Secret Stash Comic Book Store</span><hr size=1> Cassandra looked at him, almost naked, and already gasping hard and laughed, but deep in the throat so it was sexual. She looked at him and kneeled down, crawling over to his face, and grabbed his neck. She licked it once, she could nearly taste the blood underneath his skin, beneath his muscles, fueling straight to the heart, she knew what she would do when she was done, she lowered her fangs, and picked him up with ease, and pinned him to the wall. She was about to dig in when she felt it, pure rage, it was hot, white hot anger. Cassandra looked to the doorway, and saw it beginning to melt in front of her eyes. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:verdana;font-size:large;">&quot;In the end is my beginning&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

He saw what was going on, or what he thought could have been going on.  It hit him then.  This mortal had to die.  He didn't want his blood; he was disgusted with his blood.  He would die by his hands.<br>
<br>
The man stood there, almost naked.  He was stricken with fear as Gabriel flew at him from across the room.  He grabbed him by the throat and lifted him off the ground, the mans ear beside his mouth.<br>
<br>
  &quot;She's not for you,” He said to him, snarling.  Where Gabriel had his hand on the mans throat, the skin began to burn away.  There was a slight scream of pain, before the mans voice box was burned away as well.  After only a few seconds more, the neck was burned completely off.  The body fell to the floor, as the head rolled off.  He put his palms out, one facing the body, the other to the head.  Each was disintegrated.<br>
<br>
He didn't know what to do now.  He stood there, looking at the ground, facing away from Cassandra. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chococow>Choco Cow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(4/4/03 5:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Secret Stash Comic Book Store</span><hr size=1> Cassandra was a bit angry, but put it aside, and walked closer.<br>

I wanted him aroused because it makes the blood hotter, you know that,&quot; She smiled, and kissed him passionately for a minute, then pulled away. &quot;I was saving a bit for you, just so you know, but I don't think we can get any blood from him, so let's leave him be for now, they can't trace us to it.&quot; She smiled, taking his hand. &quot;We can find someone else to feed on, someone who is just as rich, come on.&quot; She smiled, and through the rubble walked out of the back room, and back onto the street. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:verdana;font-size:large;">&quot;In the end is my beginning&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

He saw the store completely totalled, still burning in some parts, and felt anger and an unmistakeble fear in the pit of his stomach that something bad had happened to his friend. He stepped cautiously over a burning #5 Inuyasha manga, and walked into the storage room, and nearly threw up. There was a black charred lump in the middle in the floor. <br>
&quot;The F*UCK!!&quot; He shouted in rage, and looked over it. He saw a bit of the green trenchcoat his friend always wore through the ash. His eyes widened. <br>
&quot;@#%$...&quot; Jay didn't see a head. His mouth hung opened. &quot;Aw...f*ck man.........what the......&quot; He looked up and saw the door open. He stood up, and with fists clenched walked out onto the street, he knew they were still out there, whoever murdered his friend would pay.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A
