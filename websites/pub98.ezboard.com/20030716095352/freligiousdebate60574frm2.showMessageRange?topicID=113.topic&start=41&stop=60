<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have to say that one of the reasons why he had it done was because of how viament the anticirc advocates are.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
Wow, that's almost like having an abortion just because you don't like how vehement pro-lifers are. <br>
<br>
I actually left the BC circ debate board because I was sick of how nasty the pro- intact crowd would get. Calling circing parents abusive and so on, which is just mean and doesn't enlighten anyone. Our medical industry puts this decision on every parent - like the foreskin is some hangnail to have removed. Culturally our attitude about it is so bad there are people who would compare it to a vestigial tail! Ugh. Many medical anatomy books show the circed penis as though that is the normal state of affairs, so it's not surprising when doctors, circed at birth themselves, advocate this procedure  -- or that parents think it's necessary. <br>
<br>
Doctors are trained how to remove it, but not trained about its function or proper care. Ironic, no?<br>
<br>
There is no medical organization in the world that recommends routine infant circumcision. That is not vehemence, it's just a bald fact.<br>
<br>
The pain thing I quoted was based on studies published in the respected medical journal The Lancet. I'm sorry for what your son had to go through with his head surgery. That he didn't cry much is anecdotal. Your boy sounds like a real trooper.<br>
<br>
I don't worry about my son being teased. Kids will always find something to tease about. My son has a bright red strawberry hemangioma birthmark on his forehead, so I know what he'll get teased about and it won't be his foreskin. He'll survive teasing about his birthmark.  I sucked my thumb as a child, boy did I get teased. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I survived it.<br>
<br>
Another anecdote: my friend's husband had a badly botched circ... guess what he got teased about?<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts. They are your kids Kim and I am sure you will make the decision you feel is best for them, just as all good parents do.<br>

<br>
it sux (for me) to have to bear tons of guilt because of a &quot;if i knew then what i know now&quot; situation.  that doesnt mean im for or against either way, really i have no strong opinion.  i just think if we had the information available to us at the time we prob wouldnt have had it done.  im still very torn as to what we will decide if this baby is a boy(due in june).  i will prob, once again this time with info, leave the decision up to my SO.<br>

<br>
First off, I'm in awe of your circ info!!!<br>
<br>
My question...is your Sig Other circed and your son not? I'm in that position. When I was pg in 1999 and found out we were having a boy, I went through the whole &quot;do we or don't we?&quot; with myself. I was of the mindset, &quot;Well, DH is so DS should be.&quot; But I found cirp.org on my own and was horrified that this practice was being done in the US while the rest of the civilized world didn't.<br>
<br>
I sent DH the links to the videos...(TMI moment: Dh has a very tight circ, complete with scar. Of course sex is great for him; he's never known any different)...he watched the Quicktime video and said, &quot;Nobody is touching *my* son!&quot;<br>
<br>
FF to over 3 years later...Spencer has never had a problem being uncirced...no infections, no UTI's, no funky smells (which can occur in a toddler due to smegma, the natural lubricant). Joe has no problem with it...the looking like Daddy and Locker room argument never held any water. Spencer knows a penis is a penis and well, he's 3 so he's never questioned the fact they look slightly different. IF he wants it done when he's a consenting adult of 18, then he can haul himself to the doctor's office.<br>
<br>
Have you read that book by John Colapinto, &quot;As Nature Made Him&quot;? With the twin boys, one of whom got a botched circ and was reared as a girl for the first 15 years of his life? Freaking scary. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We sit outside and argue all night long <br>

That's right. I am so proud of my renaissance man!  His attitude has been great. Our baby walked away in the middle of a diaper change, grabbed his prepuce and stre-e-tched it. My husband looked at him and said &quot;lucky boy!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
There is a part of us both that just...get annoyed at very strong advocates. Several times when I drove by the protestors at an abortion clinic I was ready to stop the car and walk inside the building. Just to piss them off. <br>
<br>
Its not teasing from other children I'm worried about. Its the teasing in the family. The was always the hardest for me to handle as a child. Of course its also what made me as strong as I am now. Got a nice thick skin from it. Edison will be teased. He has red hair (always a teasing factor for me as a child) and this lovely scar from ear to ear over the top of his head which I can see an potential teasing fodder. <br>
<br>
But then a third child is far away for now. If even a possibility as I'm really considering asking DH to under go the big V. <br>
<br>
Yeah Edison is a trooper. Though this teething thing has him upset today. <br>
<br>
As for girls being easier..Umm, not sure about that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Right now keeping clothing on my little naked heathen is a chore and a half. But naked she always seems to be poking at herself. And even more fun is when I catch her trying to stick things up there. I really don't want to end up at the doctor's (or worse the ER) because she has shoved something up there. <br>
<br>
Tail on the front side is FUNNY! DH is such a prude that I don't believe DD has EVER seen him naked. Not even as a new born. I doubt DS will ever see him naked though I've told him he has to show DS how to pee. <br>
<br>
I know a guy who had a botched circ. He had a hole in the skin under the head because of it. He would put a safety pin through it just because he could. And I've only seen one adult uncirced penis....well, that's part of the reason why I left the decision up to DH. Lets just leave it at that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My brother who is now 21 went through a brain surgery too. He has an identical scar from ear to ear. IF his hair is extremely short you can see it but most of the time you cant. He didn’t get teased about it at all when he was kid (except form his siblings). I hope that makes you feel a little better.<br>
<br>
I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NEVER</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> said girls are easier. I just said they were more silent about the checking their personal items out.

<br>
My son had the underside of his tongue (sorry, I can never remember the name of it), exactly a year ago (it really was just a little snip - they gave us the choice of a local and doing it on the spot, or having a general and spending the morning in the wards - so we went with the general as he was really freaked out about the process anyway)....I was unable to breast feed him because he was tongue tied...he didn't learn to speak properly because he was tongue tied.<br>
<br>
Now *if* he ended up with health problems because of his foreskin, then I would consider getting him circ'd...but why do it just because? We don't all routinely get the underside of our babies tongues snipped &quot;just in case they might be tongue tied&quot;.

One of the ways I kept myself from freaking too much before and after the surgery was to joke on the phone with my older sister about what great teasing material this would give Laurel. I hope she never comes up with half the things we thought of. But it really helped ease the tension I was feeling. Poor Edison though, the balding pattern in my Dad's side of the family is VERY strong. If Edison gets it, he'll be bald by 30. But hey, scar is a good character mark if he decides to shave his head. Could be a good pick up line. Why did your brother have surgery? Edison's sagital suture (or something like that) was closed. <br>
<br>
Sorry didn't mean to make you feel paranoid about the sticking things there. Its just, I've caught her like 5 times poking something around that area in the past week. Which is why I've really been stressing to her she needs to start wearing panties ALL the time. Ugh.<br>

Putting a huge amount of pressure on his brain. After they opened him up they were shocked to see how much his brain was squished they said with the next month he probably would have been dead. They had to put steel plates in his head to join the plates together. He actually needs to go and have it redone because of the growth of his head (he was two when they finally figured out what was wrong with him). To anyone else he looks normal it just the bridge of his nose is getting really wide and flat.  He just needs to have his face peeled back and everything readjusted (I cant understand why he doesnt want to do it<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).That is as much as I remember. <br>

One of the fun things I got to do in the military was work in an OR and see things like face lifts and breast implants being done.  About the grossest thing I saw was the removal of fungally infected toe-nails from an asian AD MIL.  She had the nastiest feet ever, and they used nice shiney chrome Ace Hardware tools!  Let me tell you, when the face is detached from the skull and they reach their fingers under it or move instruments IT IS REALLY CREEPY!  It looks like a special effects dummy and not a human any more.  Also, the breast implants were not even close to ordinary after a procedure, but apparently after they have 'settled in' they are much different.  And I am a big advocate for a breast lift as working far more wonders than a face lift!  (Gravity is a cruel force.)<br>
<br>
When you see medicine up close being done, it really looks a lot like carpentry only messier.<br>

I think circ'd ones are ugly (never seen one in the flesh..only in pictures)...I've never known any of my male family members to have problems (and we are a very &quot;open&quot; family KWIM?), DH isn't circ'd.<br>
<br>
I guess it all comes down to personal preference..at the end of the day, there really is no reason to have it done (given that everything is equal and there are no underlying problems)..so it's always going to be a cosmetic thing. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.growthspurts.com/drivee/images/434360233606.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doublelatte>Double Latte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Got Milk?</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#3333ff>(2/21/03 7:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: circ</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I just thought old uncirced penises were pretty nasty.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Shirene, many, many of our body parts may become &quot;nasty&quot; as we age. I just don't see that as a valid argument for removing them at <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>birth</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/worse.htm#old">www.mothersagainstcirc.org/worse.htm#old</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

Obviously there is no ONE correct way to parent. As I've stated before, even as a pro-intact person I find true &quot;extremism&quot; distastful. It just makes people defensive and they cling even tighter to their faulty reasoning. But I must add that the &quot;extremist&quot; label is an oft-used ploy to dismiss anyone who encourages leaving a newborn's genitals intact. And I do find it ironic that some people who are gung-ho about cutting off healthy, functioning parts of a newborn's genitals can call people who don't think its such a hot idea &quot;extremists.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shirene, in this debate I haven't told anyone how to parent.  I have only laid out facts about the functions of the foreskin, and fallacies about the dire need for its immediate amputation at birth. Yet I have been accused (not by you)  of &quot;preaching&quot; and &quot;propaganda.&quot; I'm tired of it.<br>
<br>
So let me say it loud and clear to all the proud circumcisers here: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You go right ahead and circ all of your boys. Really.

I'm finished debating this non-religious subject. However, if you, or DBC want to have more fun with this topic, I am sure you will get your money's worth by posting your enlightening objections to the foreskin (whether that be &quot;old ones are ugly&quot; or &quot;to me it's like a vestigial tail&quot;) over at BBC's circ debate board. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.babycenter.com/bbs/1196/">www.babycenter.com/bbs/1196/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
