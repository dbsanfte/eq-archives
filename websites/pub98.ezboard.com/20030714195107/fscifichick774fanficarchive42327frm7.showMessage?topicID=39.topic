Kris:  I had so much fun collaborating with Peggy again.  If you haven't, then you need to (hee hee, like you're not prolific enough already, eh Peg?).  Seriously though, it's been really nice to have someone who doesn't allow my angst muse free reign.  I hope you guys enjoy this one.<br>

 <br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
 <br>
Chloe's POV<br>
 <br>
I let out a loud laugh as I listen to Pete on my cell phone.<br>
 <br>
&quot;You do realize that he's never going to forgive us for this, don't you?&quot; I ask.<br>
 <br>
 I hear Pete laugh in return. &quot;Well, maybe if he doesn't take it as a gag gift---&quot;<br>
 <br>
I snicker as he trails off.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yeah, like that'll ever happen.  He and Lana have been dancing around with the whole 'I don't know thing' for two years now.  You really think he's going to see our fake birthday present to him and sweep her off to the nearest bedroom?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;A man can dream, Chloe,&quot; he replies. &quot;Besides, if they finally get together, then we don't have to listen to them go on and on about all the angst in their lives anymore.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Good point,&quot; I say. &quot;Okay, I'm in the store now. Any preference?&quot; <br>
 <br>
He laughs again, almost evilly.  &quot;Nah, just make sure to get enough.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;So, one then?&quot; I quip.<br>
 <br>
&quot;You're a cruel, cruel woman, Chloe Sullivan,&quot; he says.<br>
 <br>
 I know he doesn't mean it though, because it sounds like he's about to crack up again.  &quot;And don't you forget it,&quot; I tease. &quot;Talk to you later.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Bye.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I hang up my phone and shove it in my purse as I make my way toward the back of the store. It figures that they would put the stuff back there instead of right up front where I could grab it, shove it on the counter, and get out of here with as little embarrassment to myself as possible. I inwardly roll my eyes and then start looking at the aisle listings.<br>
 <br>
'Shampoo, hair color, razors, and---ah---condoms.' I walk down the aisle and start looking at the selection, still a little in disbelief that Pete talked me into this.  Clark's birthday party is tomorrow and in addition to the 'real' presents we're getting him, Pete and I decided to get him a box of condoms as a gag gift. 'Clark is going to be so embarrassed.'<br>
 <br>
I catch the image of someone in my peripheral vision as they start coming down the aisle and turn my head slightly to face them.<br>
 <br>
'Oh, shit. Of course it *had* to be *him* who catches me looking for condoms. Maybe if I don't say anything, then I won't ruin the surprise for tomorrow.'<br>
 <br>
&quot;Miss Sullivan,&quot; he says.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Mr. Luthor,&quot; I reply in the best nonchalant voice I can fake.<br>
 <br>
I turn my eyes back to focus on the numerous boxes in front of me again.<br>
 <br>
&quot;It's Lex,&quot; he reminds me.<br>
 <br>
'Whatever. He calls me Miss Sullivan, then I'm calling him Mr. Luthor', I think. He's standing next to me and I can almost *feel* him smirking as he reaches in front of me and grabs a box off one of the hooks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Hot date?&quot; he asks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Sort of,&quot; I answer cryptically. 'Go me! He thinks I'm here for myself and not for Clark.  I might actually have a chance of making it out of here without --- wait a second.  Why is *he* here?' I look at him with a slightly confused _expression on my face. &quot;Don't you have people who run these sort of errands for you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Surprisingly, no,&quot; he answers.<br>
 <br>
&quot;That *is* surprising.&quot;<br>
 <br>
He's still standing here even though he's made his selection, and it makes me a little uncomfortable that I can't read the look on his face.<br>
 <br>
 I turn my attention back to the condoms and select a couple of random boxes that say they're 'enhanced for a woman's pleasure'. Lana is going to owe me big-time if she and Clark actually do hook up because of this. I turn and flash a fake smile at him. &quot;Well, see ya.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I start walking back down the aisle so I can head to the registers up front. I can sense him following me. I wish he would just let this go so I could get out of here. In a few quick steps, he's matched my pace and is walking right beside me.<br>
 <br>
&quot;So, who is he?&quot; he asks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Pardon?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Clark didn't mention that you were seeing anyone new,&quot; he explains.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I'm sure Clark doesn't tell you most of the details he knows about my life,&quot; I interrupt, hoping to dodge the question.  &quot;And besides, he's been pretty busy with his birthday coming up tomorrow and everything.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;He *does* seem to be excited about it,&quot; Lex says.<br>
 <br>
I make a guttural sound in agreement and look ahead of me to see if I can gauge which line is the shortest from here. Lex stops walking and for some reason, I find myself stopping and turning around to face him.  <br>
 <br>
He gives me a somewhat bemused look.  &quot;You're not curious?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;About what?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You didn't ask me why *I* needed the condoms,&quot; he says.<br>
 <br>
'Yeah, cuz' I really want to hear all about that,' I think sarcastically. I smirk at him as I fold my arms across my chest. &quot;Well, they're really only intended for one functional purpose, *Lex*.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I meant about my date,&quot; he clarifies. &quot;Being a reporter, I at least thought you'd be a little inquisitive as to her identity.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yeah, well, there's the magic word---*reporter*---not gossip columnist. Although, if you're dying to tell someone who the latest incredibly boring society bimbo is, then I'll be happy to pass it on to Lana for you.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Boring?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;*That's* the part of my description you have a problem with?&quot; I ask in surprise.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Well---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; I interrupt. &quot;And yes, *boring*.  Say what you will about Victoria Hardwick, but at least you two had enough chemistry to not let you act twice your age.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Victoria got married to James Prescott---and are you implying that the women I date are---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Making you seem old, boring, and altogether uninteresting?  Absolutely,&quot; I say. 'Great. Way to pick a fight Chloe. Time to change the topic so I can get out of here.' &quot;James Prescott? Really? Lucky girl.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;He's not your type,&quot; Lex says with a disapproving look.<br>
 <br>
'Because I would have had a shot with him anyway,' I think sarcastically again, but decide not to say it aloud.  &quot;I didn't say he was and he's married now, anyway.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Is it my imagination, or did you just call me boring and uninteresting?&quot;<br>
 <br>
'He had to catch that,' I think and can't resist the next rib. &quot;You forgot old.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I'm only five years older than you are, Chloe,&quot; he says.  I shrug and try to turn around to head to the registers again, but he stops me by grabbing my arm lightly. &quot;Did I do something to earn your sudden animosity toward me?&quot; I sigh and run a hand through my hair as I give him what I hope passes for an apologetic look.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Sorry.  I just hate to see anyone wasting their life the way you are.&quot;  Whoops. I didn't actually mean to say that last part out loud. He arches an eyebrow at me and I feel compelled to continue. &quot;The last guy I dated, it really put things in perspective for me.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Clark said he tried to kill you.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Actually, he tried to kill Pete and I sort of got caught in the crossfire,&quot; I say, not really understanding why I feel like I have to explain this to him. &quot;But he was really a pretty good guy until then.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;It sounds like it,&quot; Lex says sarcastically.<br>
 <br>
&quot;We had chemistry,&quot; I say, starting to motion wildly with my hands, &quot;he was fun!&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I'd like to hear your definitions of 'good' and 'fun',&quot; he says seriously. Crap. He's giving me that protective look that Clark and Pete always try to pull on me.<br>
 <br>
'Like I can't take care of myself? Ugh!' &quot;Fine. He was cute, smart, athletic, acted like I was the only woman in the world, he never took himself too seriously, and he didn't care what other people thought about him,&quot; I rattle off. Lex looks uncomfortable for some reason, but it's probably because he's not used to my ramblings like Clark, Pete, and Lana are.<br>
 <br>
&quot;It sounds like you were in love with him,&quot; he finally says.<br>
 <br>
'Okay, not what I was expecting him to say, and definitely not in the tone I thought I'd hear it,' I think. &quot;*Like*, not *love*,&quot; I say. He tilts his head to the side and gives me an understanding half-grin.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I would imagine him trying to kill one of your best friends put a bit of a damper on that relationship.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You could say that,&quot; I agree and shake my head. &quot;I still don't know why he got jealous of Pete,&quot; I muse aloud. I watch Lex's eyebrows shoot up in surprise and then hear my phone start to ring. I dig through my purse and then hold the phone up to my ear. &quot;Hello?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You get them yet?&quot; Pete asks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Hey Pete,&quot; I say. &quot;Yeah. I was just about to get in line.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I thought of something else,&quot; Pete says. I smile broadly. It doesn't happen often, but when Pete gets in a mischievous mood, he can be a lot of fun.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Shoot.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Grab a can of whipped cream while you're there,&quot; he says. I laugh and Lex is still standing there staring at me.<br>
 <br>
&quot;No problem. I'll see you later.&quot; I hang up the phone and look at Lex. &quot;Looks like I need to pick up something else, and I wouldn't dream of keeping you from yet another boring, personality-sucking brunette, so I'll talk to you later.&quot;<br>
 <br>
He blinks at me in surprise and I turn around to head over toward the dairy case. I can hear him following me again and I know I shouldn't have taken that last shot, but the women he dates are so wrong for him. Which, really, I suppose is the point. He knows they're wrong for him and he knows he won't get attached to them because of it. He doesn't want to have his heart broken. He comes up beside me again and gives me a strange look.<br>
 <br>
&quot;You're dating Pete?&quot; he asks.<br>
 <br>
'Why does he sound so angry about it?' I wonder. I give him a placating, yet teasing smile and then chuckle. &quot;No. But if I decided to, at least he's not boring.&quot;<br>
 <br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
 <br>
Lex's POV<br>
 <br>
Why oh why, of all the sporadic times I come to this department store, did she have to be here?<br>
 <br>
I look heavenward, as I start to turn away and walk out of the store---*God, do you really hate me enough to punish me this way*? Isn't it bad enough I have the worst father in the world now I have to run into her---the object of my dreams and desires? And she will only ever be a dream. It will never happen---because of age and other things---mainly that she doesn't know that I am alive other than as interview material or being Clark's friend too.<br>
 <br>
'Wimp!' a little voice in my head says. 'Go on! Talk to her. Get to know her a bit more and then who knows what will happen? Maybe she likes you that way?'<br>
 <br>
Wimp? I'm not a wimp -- well, maybe once I was when I was going with a certain doctor, who shall remain nameless. She really did a number on me and I promised myself never to fall in love again. And yet, I can't keep this promise.<br>
 <br>
I turn around and walk back to the aisle. She's moved to another aisle, looking intently at the product before her--- condoms? What the hell? She's too young to be sexually active ---isn't she? Well, I did lose my virginity at 16 myself, and she's a year older than that now. Uuuugh---do not like the thought of her losing her virginity to a boy in the back seat of a Chevy truck.<br>
 <br>
Okay---another embarrassing thing to do today---have her watch me pick up some condoms so it won't look like I'm stalking her in the department store. This is so Dawson's Creek.<br>
 <br>
I walk slowly down the aisle, but she hasn't turned to look at me. Maybe she won't notice me. Yeah, right, Luthor. You're bald man---you stand out in a crowd anywhere. That plus the damn charisma you inherited from your mother---I would say father but I never want to inherit anything from that monster.<br>
 <br>
Oh God, she caught me. What do I say? Say hello, Lex. It's the reason you followed her down the aisle, after all. And remember, your mother always taught you to be polite.<br>
 <br>
So, I do just that and she answers in kind. I grab a box of condoms and to offset that awkward movement, I ask if she's going on a hot date.<br>
 <br>
She tries to change the subject, asking, 'Don't you have people who run these sorts of errands for you?' I nearly laugh at the question but answer, 'Surprisingly no.'<br>
 <br>
Like I'm going to ask Cook to get me them---the woman always gives me a dirty look when I bring a young lady home. Maybe I should just get stock in a condom company and they can send them to me free?<br>
 <br>
I've picked my selection, move legs. But, I can't move. It's like my mind won't let me until I know who this person is she's going with.<br>
 <br>
She picks her selection and walks towards the front of the store. I ask who she's going out with. She turns and questions my question. I tell her I haven't heard anything from Clark about the new guy in her life---I was just curious. But my mind keeps saying you want to know so you can take care of him, if he ever hurts her. She says that Clark isn't always privy to her dates, especially now, since his birthday party is coming up.<br>
 <br>
I decide to change the subject after that---wondering to her why she isn't interested in why I need them. She states the obvious---only one reason of getting condoms. I answer with whom I'm using them with, not why I'm using them. I thought the reporter in her would be chomping at the bit to know.<br>
 <br>
She goes into a description of my dates --- how they are boring and that at least Victoria had me acting my own age. What the---? She then goes into how the women in my life make me act old and boring. Old --- I am not old. There is only 5 years between us, I state to her.<br>
 <br>
Somehow this leads to her choice in boyfriends --- especially the last, who tried to kill Pete. At least my recent dates haven't tried to kill me. Well, maybe Desiree---but Helen never tried to kill me---just bored me to death. Oh God, maybe she's right---I'm not acting my age. I'm boring and stoic. I've turned into my father. No---I'm not old and boring. I'm exciting and energetic. I've got the world on a string---only problem with that, I have nobody to hand it to. And the only person I really want to hand it to, just told me I was old and boring. Or was that my dates?<br>
 <br>
I listen to her saying that it's my dates that have made me old and boring. Then I listen to her last boyfriend again and how they had chemistry. My jealousy is running rampant in my body and the only thing I can do to cover it is give her a protective big brother look.<br>
 <br>
And ask her what her concept of good and fun when it came to last boyfriend. She gives me the description and I get this uncomfortable feeling---like she's almost describing me but not quite. I don't think I've ever had fun in my life, ever. And the only person I want to have fun with has. Maybe she can teach me how to have fun and I can---well, let's get the first part done first.<br>
 <br>
I blurt out that she must have been in love with him. She looks at me strangely and my heart soars when she says, like, not love. Then I state the obvious that of course, he tried to kill your friend, which would put a damper on things. She agrees with me and then ponders why he would be jealous of Pete. She's got to be kidding---she's so beautiful and any man with her might have a slight tendency to be jealous, who aren't mature enough to know that she's a one man woman.<br>
 <br>
The phone rings.<br>
 <br>
She answers it and talks for a minute. Then she's off towards the dairy case, with me following behind, even though she tells me to head off to my latest conquest. Like I'm going to admit that I don't actually have a date and I only picked up the condoms because she happened to be in that aisle. Besides, this is so much more interesting than a date with one of the women I've been going out with recently anyway. Then it hits me. And I ask her---are you dating Pete?<br>
 <br>
She gives me a look and answers me, saying she isn't but if she was, at least he wasn't boring.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Chloe?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;What?&quot; she asks, as she opens the dairy case.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Do you really think I'm boring?&quot;<br>
 <br>
She looks unsure of how to answer that question, like she doesn't want to hurt my feelings. Great. Way to go, Luthor.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Lex---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Teach me how to act my own age. Teach me how to have fun. I don't want to be my father---I want to live life to the fullest,&quot; I blurt out.  She gives me a bemused look.<br>
 <br>
She grabs the whipped cream out of the dairy case. &quot;No comments!&quot; she states, as I lift an eyebrow at her selection. &quot;I'll teach you how to have fun, only if you follow my every rule.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Okay.&quot; What have I gotten myself into?<br>
 <br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~ <br>
 <br>
Chloe's POV<br>
 <br>
What have I gotten myself into? Did I seriously just agree to 'teach' Lex Luthor how to have fun? What was I thinking? Wait a second---what was *he* thinking?<br>
 <br>
&quot;Lex, are you sure you want to do this?&quot; I ask as we start walking again. &quot;I mean, you and I aren't exactly the best of friends and I'm sure you have a beautiful, vapid date waiting for you in the car.&quot; And why did I just have to say that out loud? He probably didn't even mean that he wanted to start right away on the whole 'learning how to have fun' thing; and for some reason the thought of him having another woman out in the car is really disturbing me, but I can't figure out why.<br>
 <br>
&quot;No,&quot; he says, snapping me out of my inner monologue.<br>
 <br>
&quot;No - you don't want to do this?  Or, no - you haven't picked her up yet?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I don't have a date for tonight,&quot; he says simply.<br>
 <br>
&quot;What? But I thought---&quot; I trail off as I motion to the box of condoms in his hand. He smirks at me and I feel a blush rising to my cheeks. I try to force it down, but it's no good; so I look off to the side instead, hoping he won't mention it.<br>
 <br>
&quot;You thought *what*?&quot; he prods. I grit my teeth and turn to face him again.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Nothing,&quot; I lie. One corner of his mouth is still turned upward and I let out a small sigh as I shake my head. &quot;Never mind.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;How about you?&quot; he asks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;What about me?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;It doesn't exactly look like you're without plans for the evening,&quot; he answers, looking down at the two boxes of condoms and the bottle of whipped cream in my arms. &quot;What made you assume that we would be starting tonight?&quot;<br>
 <br>
'Crap.  He had to catch that. Does nothing get past this guy?' I wonder.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Ah. Well, these are actually for tomorrow,&quot; I say, trying not to give away too much. &quot;And---&quot; I take a deep breath and release it before flashing him an embarrassed smile, &quot;---I don't know why I assumed. Sorry.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;It's okay,&quot; he says. &quot;It was a good assumption.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You want to start tonight?&quot; I ask in surprise.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Unless you---&quot; he trails off and we both start to chuckle.  Geez, we sound like Clark and Lana.<br>
 <br>
Oh My God. We sound like Clark and Lana. Okay, well except for the whole 'too hormonal to the point of almost being pathetic' part. But still, Lex and I don't have those kinds of feelings for each other. Or at least he doesn't have them for me. I've had a crush on him for a while now. I inwardly sigh. I meant what I told him before.  The women he dates are all wrong for him, but is there a possibility that I only think that because they're not me? I take back the part about not being pathetic. I fit the description to a T.<br>
 <br>
Then something comes into my head. Maybe I can use this opportunity for him to learn about and possibly even start to like me as someone more than a friendly acquaintance. I take a breath and smile at him. This is going to be a night to remember.<br>
 <br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
 <br>
Lex's POV<br>
 <br>
She's lost in the stratosphere. I stand there, waiting patiently for her response to my last sentence. Then it hits me---Oh My God, we're Clark and Lana, maybe. Hopefully? Without the 'hormonal to the point of almost being pathetic' part, I hope. Damn it, I'm dreaming again. After all, does she have feelings for me---not that I can see? Course that might have been the problem between Clark and Lana---he always wondered if she had feelings for him. Well, he's taking that leap of faith. He told me tomorrow night was going to be the night he and Lana would get together---he hoped. Hmmmmm---wonder if I should give him these condoms instead? God, Lex, you are so corrupting the youth in this town. No, keep them for myself instead.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Chloe?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yes, Lex?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Do you want to start tonight or not?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Ah---oh---yeah, tonight is as good a time as any.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Don't sound so enthusiastic, Sullivan.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She smirks at me. &quot;Sorry I can't muster much up when I need to use the ladies room. You hold onto this and I'll go in. Then we'll see if we can turn a dull boy into an exciting man.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She hands me the can and walks towards the ladies room. I follow her. &quot;Hey, was that an insult?&quot;<br>
 <br>
I can't hear her response to that so I walk in. Lex---you just walked into the ladies room. Ah well, might as well have some fun.  <br>
 <br>
&quot;Who's there?&quot; Chloe shouts out.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Just your current project,&quot; I state with a smile.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Lex! Get the hell out of here! This is the ladies room!&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I would, if I could hear you talk through the walls. What did you say as you went in?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I said, 'No, that wasn't an insult---just a statement of fact'. But I will start insulting you, unless you get out of here.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;No, I think I like it in here,&quot; I reply, leaning against the sink.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Lex!&quot; I hear a sigh. &quot;Okay, you can stay in here, as long as you turn yourself to the wall and don't look at the cubicle I'm in.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Chloe, I don't have X-ray vision. I can't see what you're doing.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Just do it, please.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Because, because it just creeps me out when somebody is even looking in the same direction when I'm going to the washroom. I just can't do it.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I stand there, chuckling away. &quot;Is this supposed to be part of the 'teaching me how to have fun' lesson?&quot; I finally ask, when I get myself under control.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Lex, please.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;All right. Never let it be said that I don't give a lady what she wants.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I walk away from the sink and turn towards the wall. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You're welcome. Now hurry up. I want to see what you think of as fun. By the way, what areas will we be hitting during this course, Teach?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Well---I was thinking---music, movies, sports, and games.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Games?&quot; I ask, lifting an eyebrow. &quot;What sort of games?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Oh, get your mind out of the gutter, Luthor. I was thinking Truth or Dare, not Spin the Bottle.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Oooops, think maybe Chloe might have some feelings there for you, Lex? Maybe I should test this out? &quot;Don't worry, I wasn't thinking Spin the Bottle. More---Post Office.&quot; Hmmmm---now I wonder what she'll think of that response.<br>
 <br>
Silence. &quot;Chloe, are you still there? You haven't fallen into the toilet have you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;No---just thinking of a good comeback. Oh, got it.&quot; I hear the toilet flush.<br>
 <br>
I hear the stall door open. &quot;You can turn around now.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I turn and see her smirking. I watch her walk over, use the sink, and then dry herself off.<br>
 <br>
Then she walks out the door, me following. &quot;Oh My God! Where is everybody?&quot;<br>
 <br>
I bump into her. &quot;What?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Nobody but us chickens here, Luthor,&quot; she states, a touch frightened or is that annoyance?<br>
 <br>
I look at my watch. &quot;After 9---the stores closed.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She turns around and looks at me. &quot;This is your fault!&quot; we both say together.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Listen, it's both our faults, okay. Let me just use my cell to get the---damn it!&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;What?&quot; she asks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;The battery has gone. Try yours.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She gets it out and tries it. &quot;Same problem.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Now what do we do?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Well, you could use a thing they call a pay phone.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I give her a slight smirk and walk off to the phones. I pick it up, put my hand out to her, and she looks at me, questioningly. &quot;Do you have a quarter?&quot;<br>
 <br>
She smirks at me.  &quot;It's 911, you don't need a quarter---and it's way more than that now anyway.&quot;  <br>
 <br>
Oh. Guess it's been a while since I've had to use a payphone and suddenly I feel myself fitting into the 'old' part of her earlier description of me. I get 911 and find out, it might be awhile before we are rescued---seems there is a pile-up and all emergency crews, police included, are needed. So---<br>
 <br>
I hang up the phone and tell her what's happening. She lets out a sigh. &quot;Well, I guess we'll be here for a while. No time like the present to teach you to have some fun.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You mean we're not having fun yet?&quot; I ask her, sarcastically.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Keep it up, Luthor, and the only fun you'll be having is trying to find a place to hide from Hurricane Chloe.&quot;<br>

~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
 <br>
Chloe's POV<br>
 <br>
I can't believe this is happening.  I'm locked in the store with Lex for what could possibly be the entire night. Geez!  Doesn't anybody check the restrooms before they close for the night? Apparently not in Smallville. I roll my eyes and notice that Lex is giving me a strange, almost uncomfortable look.<br>
 <br>
&quot;What?&quot; I ask.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Nothing,&quot; he says, obviously lying. I place my hands on my hips and watch him motion to the phone with his head. &quot;You should call your boyfriend. Let him know what's going on.&quot;<br>
 <br>
'Boyfriend? Where did he get that idea?' I wonder. Then it hits me. I was about to buy two boxes of condoms and I berated him on how much his love life sucks---of course he thinks I have a boyfriend. And I suppose I should really correct him, but I have a bad feeling that we would only get in a fight about it. I mean, he's not going to give much credit to my ranting that his love life is in shambles when he realizes that I don't even have one of my own. I manage to fake a smile as I prepare to lie---which hopefully he'll believe, because I've never been that good at lying.<br>
 <br>
&quot;He's not expecting me to call tonight,&quot; I say. Hey---it's not a complete lie; after all, he can't be expecting me to call if he doesn't exist, right? Oh, crap. It doesn't look like Lex believes me.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Don't you think he'll want to know?&quot; he asks. I let out an inward sigh of relief. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Why would he?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I would if I were your---&quot; he trails off and I arch an eyebrow. Lex couldn't have just been about to say what I think he was about to say.<br>
 <br>
&quot;If you were my *what*?&quot;<br>
 <br>
He flashes a smile at me to get out of answering the question. Smart man---or not so smart man, considering that he can't see that I like him.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I thought you were going to teach me how to have fun,&quot; he says. I smile.<br>
 <br>
&quot;In a locked store?&quot; I ask; whoa---that came out way more suggestive than I thought it would. He leans closer to me and I hope he doesn't notice my breath hitch.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Mind out of the gutter, Sullivan,&quot; he teases. <br>
 <br>
I force down the blush that I feel rising to my cheeks.  &quot;Out of the gutter, huh?  Okay, well I'll have to change the agenda for this evening then,&quot; I retort snarkily. I burst out laughing at the shocked look on his face. &quot;I was just joking, Lex. So, where do you want to start first?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I suppose Pete wouldn't appreciate it if we really did go to the gutter, would he?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Pete?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Oh, that's right---Pete's not the mystery boyfriend,&quot; he muses aloud as we start to walk back through the store. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Oh---so, you want to know who the mystery guy is, do you?&quot; He nods and I shake my head. &quot;Sorry to disappoint you, but I ain't telling.&quot;<br>
 <br>
He gives me a smirk. &quot;That's fine. I'm sure that you and Joe will have a very nice life together.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Who is Joe?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Just throwing names out there,&quot; he says with a shrug.  &quot;It's Smallville; we've got to have a few Joes in town---right?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Not that I know of,&quot; I answer. &quot;And you should just stop guessing, because you'll never get it.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You could just tell me.&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;I could,&quot; I agree, &quot;but I just told you I'm not telling.&quot; He purses his lips slightly, but I can tell it's only to try and hide the smile that's tugging at the corners of his mouth.<br>
 <br>
&quot;You said something about sports. How about, if I win---you tell me?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Kind of skipping ahead there, aren't you? I believe I mentioned movies and music before that,&quot; I remind him. I turn to him and smile broadly. &quot;And why is it so important for you to know who I'm dating anyway?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;I just don't want to see you get hurt.&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Well, in case you hadn't noticed, I already have two older brothers with the names of Clark and Pete. I don't really need another one, but thanks anyway,&quot; I say with a touch of bitterness. I stop walking and let out a sigh.  &quot;Sorry.  I would like you to be my friend though. So, movies first?&quot; I ask, quickly steering the conversation away from the fact that I don't want him as another big brother.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; he says in a teasing voice. &quot;You're not going to make me watch some sappy romantic comedy or something are you?&quot; I smirk. <br>
 <br>
&quot;I am now,&quot; I say. He gives me a pleading look and I laugh.  &quot;Okay, okay. How does a movie with a little bit of everything sound to you?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Define 'a little bit of everything'.&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;I thought part of this agreement was that you weren't going to question me,&quot; I say with raised eyebrows, silently reminding him who's supposed to be in charge here. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Yes, ma'am,&quot; he teases. I smile at him and we make our way to the video section of the store. I smile even brighter when I see the DVD I had in mind, just sitting there, already opened, behind the counter. Guess the clerk for this area had the same idea I did.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Go sit down.&quot; I see Lex looking around with some confusion and I smile. &quot;Just sit on the floor over there, Luthor. It's not going to kill you.&quot; <br>
 <br>
He doesn't look pleased with the idea of having to sit on the floor, but he does it anyway, which actually sort of surprises me. I put the movie in and turn on the TV that he's sitting in front of. He gives me a little smirk and pats the floor next to him. Hmm. I hadn't thought things through that far in advance. But hey---if he can do it, so can I. I grab the remote off of the DVD player and walk over to sit down next to him. <br>
 <br>
The movie starts to play and I can see Lex glancing at me, from the corner of my eye. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Galaxy Quest?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Have you seen it?&quot; I ask without turning my gaze away from the screen.<br>
 <br>
&quot;No, but---&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;But what?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;I just never pictured you as a science fiction fan,&quot; he says. I laugh. <br>
 <br>
&quot;You really have never seen this movie, have you?&quot; <br>
 <br>
He gives me a strange look and we start to watch the movie.  Every once in a while, I look over at him, enjoying the expressions on his face as the movie hits all the different emotional keys. I think I see him glancing over at me too, but I quickly brush away the thought. He was probably just wondering why I was staring at him instead of at the screen. <br>
 <br>
The movie ends and he smiles over at me. I nudge him with the side of my body and smile back at him. <br>
 <br>
&quot;See?  Fun,&quot; I say. He's still leaning into my body from when I nudged him and he raises a hand to brush some hair behind my ear. His fingers linger a little longer than necessary, but I don't mind. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Yeah. Fun.&quot;<br>
 <br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Lex's POV <br>
 <br>
Yeah, fun, I think, after I say it out loud. I just thank God it wasn't Moulin Rouge or something as erotic. I know we Luthors have a solid rein on our emotions but I have to wonder sometimes---maybe I didn't inherit that ability as well as I thought I had. Or maybe it's because of the woman, sitting beside me on the floor, that I don't have as tight a rein on them. Sitting on the floor---my father would laugh at this. But me, it's the most natural thing to do--that, and glancing at her once in a while, during the movie.<br>
 <br>
I can't believe the emotions this movie brought out of me: the surprise, the enjoyment, the laughter, the angst, and even love. But the last wasn't brought out so much from the movie as from Chloe---who deemed to share one of her passions with me---to help me find my own passion for life. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Lex, are you okay?&quot; <br>
 <br>
I turn to look at her. &quot;For the first time, I think I actually enjoyed sitting on the floor. Thanks.&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;For what?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;For helping me find my inner child again.&quot; <br>
 <br>
She smiles at that. &quot;Well, we've only begun, Lex. Just wait for the musical intermission. You are so going to be a very bright boy---not a dull dullard, like your Daddy not so dearest.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I get up and wipe at my butt---then I offer her my hand. She accepts it and stands before me. What do we do now? <br>
 <br>
She takes the question out of my hands when she gives me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. &quot;What was that for?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Your reward for passing the first exam from the Chloe Sullivan School of Charm. Come on---next lesson coming up.&quot; <br>
 <br>
She takes my hand and we walk over to the CD's.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Hmmmmm---soundtracks are right here. Now, let me see---oh, this one and oh good, they've still got this one too.&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;What?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Just be patient, Mr. Impatient. You'll find out what I have in store for you, soon enough. Now---just have to get a couple of things from the clothing department and then find a table to bring over here. Sit and watch a cartoon while you wait---or just watch what's going on in the world outside.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I nod my head and she's gone, leaving her CD's behind. I'm tempted to go over to see what's in store for me but I want to be surprised. <br>
 <br>
She's back in a few minutes, her coat and clothing replaced by a pair of jeans and a tank top. &quot;What the---?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Come on---I need your help to bring this table over.&quot; <br>
 <br>
I walk with her to a table that once had sweaters on it. We carry it over to the movie/music section of the store. Then she picks up the first of the CD's she appropriated from the stacks and opens it up. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Who's paying for this?&quot; I ask, with a slight smile. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Well, since I'm not getting paid for teaching you how to have fun, you are!&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Fair enough. Start the lesson, Teach!&quot; <br>
 <br>
She places the CD into the CD player and motions me over. &quot;I've got it on the right track--just push the button when I tell you to, okay?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I think I can do that.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She walks over to the table and jumps up. &quot;All righty---let it roll, Lexy.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I do that and Leann Rimes sexy voice wafts into the air. 'Can't Fight The Moonlight' plays on but I really don't notice the music as much as what it's causing Chloe to do. It's like I'm in the bar Coyote Ugly and she's one of the bartenders, giving the patrons a show that would bring down the bar. Oh God, she would pick this song. Every time I hear it, I picture her doing just this. Then something unusual happens. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Come on, Lex, dance with me up here.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;No!&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Lex---I'm the teacher and you don't question me, remember. You do everything I suggest.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You tell me the name of the boyfriend and I'll do it.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She lets out a sigh and jumps down from the table, walking over to the CD player and stopping the CD. Then she turns to me. &quot;Okay---the teacher shouldn't push the student I guess. Well, did you have fun?&quot;<br>
 <br>
I smile at her and walk over. &quot;Yes, I did. Didn't know you could move like that.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You ain't seen nothing yet! You think my fast moves are great---wait till you see me slow dance---even if I have to do it by myself.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Well, I think I can manage a slow dance, if you don't mind me as a partner.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She blushes slightly and then hides her blush by saying, &quot;Let me just get something more appropriate to wear.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Oh, this is fine,&quot; I reply, giving her one of my best suggestive looks. She blushes again and walks away, towards the clothing section again. She's so cute when she blushes.<br>
 <br>
She's back in her street clothes again, carrying what she was wearing, and her coat. &quot;More to add to the bill,&quot; she says.<br>
 <br>
&quot;That's okay---it was worth it, seeing you in such a seductive way.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Well, Luthor, you really have her turning red now. She gives me a slight smile and walks over to the counter, taking the other CD and opening it. She places it in the CD player, taking the other one and putting it back in its jacket. She smiles and presses the button. The strains of Fallen come out of the player. And I'm lost once more, watching her walk over and take my hands.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Let's slow dance, Lex.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I nod and we dance---the lyrics hitting me in the heart as much as this beauty before me:<br>
 <br>
&quot;I can't believe it, you're a dream coming true<br>
 I can't believe how I had fallen for you<br>
 And I was not looking, was content to remain<br>
 And it's ironic to be back here again<br>
 <br>
 You are the one, who's led me to the sun<br>
 How could I know, I was lost without you<br>
 <br>
 And I want to tell you, you control my rain<br>
 And you should know that you're the life in my veins&quot;<br>
 <br>
She moves closer to me, snuggling. God, this has got to stop before it goes too far.<br>
 <br>
I stop dancing and she backs away, looking up at me. &quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Ah---this was a song I used to dance with---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Enough said. Bad memories not allowed tonight. I'll just stop it,&quot; she says, walking out of my arms and giving me an understanding look. She walks over and takes it out.<br>
 <br>
I'm left standing, feeling like the best part of me has left. You just lied to her, Luthor. The real reason you stopped dancing is because you wanted to kiss her so badly, you could taste it. Admit it---you have more than lustful feelings for her---for the first time in your life, you are in love. And you are so afraid she doesn't feel the same way.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Lex?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;What?&quot; I ask her.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Are you---okay, I won't ask that question because you aren't okay. Want to talk about it?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Not right now---maybe later. Chloe, maybe we should go to the next lesson in fun.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Sure---by the way, you passed this one too---just for not grabbing something to cover me up when I started dancing to Leann---trust me, that's what Clark and Pete would do.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Then they would have missed all the fun,&quot; I state. We both laugh at that and are back on an even keel of friendship, even though I want more. &quot;So, what's next, Ms. Sullivan?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Sports---how are you at floor hockey?&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
 <br>
Chloe's POV<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Floor hockey?! Brain---please tell me that those words did *not* just come out of my mouth. They did? Crap. And the smirk he's giving me only confirms it. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Let's go, Sullivan,&quot; he says smugly. <br>
 <br>
Okay, now I know why hockey players must get in so many fights. I want to smack him upside the head and we haven't even started the game yet. I lift my chin and give him a smile full of false confidence as we start to walk toward the sporting goods department, side by side. <br>
 <br>
Realistically though, what choice did I have besides floor hockey? None. The only basketball hoop they have set up is definitely for display only and would get knocked to the floor with the first ball that went through it. Baseball was definitely out of the running, because not only for the obvious reason of on the off-chance of one of us actually hitting the ball and it plowing into another department full of expensive items that I would make Lex pay for, there would also be the dreaded baseball analogy. <br>
 <br>
The analogy that Pete and Clark use---okay, primarily Pete since Clark's love life isn't really past sharing longing gazes with Lana---the one where he uses each 'base' as a metaphor for how far he got with his date du jour. The problem is that I can see Lex teasing me endlessly about it and it was hard enough to not kiss him senseless when we were slow dancing. I let out a small sigh when I think about how badly that ended. I had to go and pick a song that reminded him of---whoever she was. It must have been one of his more special girlfriends to get that reaction out of him though. <br>
 <br>
I feel a twinge of jealousy sweep through me again. It was bad enough when it happened while we were dancing and he abruptly stopped us, but to have the time to dissect the situation and realize that the woman was really special to him and that I never will be---I take a deep breath and stiffen my spine. I am not going to let this get in the way. Tonight is supposed to be about getting Lex to loosen up and have fun, not about the unrequited feelings I harbor for him. I can feel his eyes on me, but I don't turn to face him.<br>
 <br>
&quot;You look nervous,&quot; he goads.<br>
 <br>
 I manage to give him a wince of a grin. &quot;A little,&quot; I lie. &quot;It's been a long time since Clark and Pete made me play pond hockey with them, and this time I won't have skates.&quot; He's smirking at me again and it sends a shiver down my spine. I swear he must know what that does to me, otherwise ---why would he do it so much? <br>
 <br>
&quot;We could see if they have your size,&quot; he suggests.<br>
 <br>
 I chuckle. &quot;Well, we also have no ice, so that *could* be a problem.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I meant roller blades,&quot; he clarifies. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Oh. Well, they don't. But thanks for the thoughtfulness.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;How do you know they don't?&quot; he asks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Because they don't sell roller blades here at all, Lex,&quot; I tell him. He arches an eyebrow at me and I feel the corners of my mouth being pulled upward by their own volition. &quot;You have to go to one of the larger chains for stuff like that.  Relatively speaking, this is a smaller store, so they have a more limited selection.&quot; <br>
 <br>
It looks like he doesn't have a response for once. Wow. I rendered Lex Luthor speechless. I'm amazing. He stops walking and motions to the 'Sporting Goods' sign hanging over the two aisles that we're next to. Oh. <br>
 <br>
&quot;How do you want to do this?&quot; he asks, strolling over to the hockey sticks like he knew exactly where they were the whole time. <br>
 <br>
&quot;I---&quot; I trail off when he offers me a hockey stick. I frown as I accept it from him and he smirks again, although I don't raise my eyes to get a good look at it this time.<br>
 <br>
&quot;You don't know anything about hockey, do you?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Very little,&quot; I hear myself admitting. He lets out a low chuckle and places his hand on the small of my back as he leans closer to me. Oh, God. Don't do that, don't do that. My eyes start to close involuntarily when his warm breath hits my ear.<br>
 <br>
&quot;You could just forfeit and tell me who he is right now,&quot; he says. I blink as his words register in my head, but then I turn to face him.<br>
 <br>
&quot;If I remember correctly, I never agreed to tell you who he is ---regardless of who won,&quot; I say. &quot;And besides, this is supposed to be about fun, right?  You shouldn't go dragging ---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You're saying that he's not fun?&quot; he asks with a raised eyebrow and a grin. <br>
 <br>
&quot;I was *going* to say that you shouldn't go dragging a *bet* into it,&quot; I reply.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Afraid you'll lose?&quot; he teases. <br>
 <br>
&quot;No,&quot; I say, a little too abruptly. He laughs at me and I purse my lips, but it quickly turns into a smile. &quot;Okay, *yes*. But you should learn to have fun just for fun's sake, not because there's something else at risk.&quot; He seems to be thinking about it and finally gives me a shrug of his shoulders.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Fine,&quot; he agrees in a begrudging tone. &quot;But I'll find out eventually.&quot; I roll my eyes. <br>
 <br>
'No you won't,' I think and then smile. He starts to take a puck off the shelf and I cringe as a memory from the last time I played hockey flits through my mind. <br>
 <br>
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asks, obviously having noticed the cringe.  I let out a nervous laugh and bite my lower lip. His attention seems to have been brought down to my mouth with the action--- interesting. <br>
 <br>
&quot;I---um---just remembered the last time I played hockey,&quot; I tell him. He looks at me suspiciously and I continue. &quot;I may have---sort of---well---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Spit it out, Sullivan.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Let's just say there's a *reason* that it's been a long time since Clark and Pete made me play with them,&quot; I say. He looks wary and I let out a resigned sigh. &quot;I kind of put Jake Thornton in the hospital,&quot; I say quickly. He looks surprised.  &quot;But it wasn't my fault---okay, well, it sort of was---but how was I supposed to know he would come up right next to me while I was getting ready to hit the puck?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;What happened?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I just told you what happened.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;No.  You told me what lead up to what happened,&quot; he corrects. &quot;So, what happened?&quot; I look down and make a grumbling sound.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I sort of broke his nose and a couple of his teeth,&quot; I say.<br>
 <br>
Lex surprises me and starts laughing. And it's a real laugh--- not a chuckle or a restrained laugh like I hear him give Clark sometimes---but an actual, head thrown back in amusement, laugh. I can't help but smile. <br>
 <br>
&quot;So, anyway, I understand if you---&quot; I'm cut off by him smiling brightly and shaking his head.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Not a chance. You're not getting out of it that easy.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Damn,&quot; I mutter under my breath, only half-kidding. &quot;Okay.  But if I break your nose or a couple of teeth---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Visit me in the hospital,&quot; he says wryly. Lex motions to one end of the aisle. &quot;You want that side or the other?&quot; I frown, looking over the selection on the shelves instead of where Lex is looking.<br>
 <br>
&quot;They don't even have nets,&quot; I say. &quot;How are we supposed to know when someone gets a shot?&quot; He shrugs as if it's nothing.<br>
 <br>
&quot;End of the aisle---if it goes past then the other person gets a point.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;That's a pretty big space to guard,&quot; I say skeptically. I feel his hand on my back again, and is it my imagination or did his lips just barely graze my ear? I feel the shiver of delight pass through me and I know it wasn't just my imagination. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Don't think you can handle it?&quot; he asks. I furrow my brow.  What? Oh, right---the guarding the end of the aisle thing. I turn my head slightly and smile at the _expression on his face when our mouths are so close together now. <br>
 <br>
&quot;I can if you can.&quot;<br>
 <br>
We start to play and it's pretty much how I expected it to be. A couple of my wild shots end up throwing the puck off the ground and hitting stuff on the shelves. Lex didn't seem to care at all though and it really seems like he's having fun. I suppose I should have expected that more with the sports portion of the lesson tonight, because he has that competitive side that he usually only uses for business. My mind goes back to the game, where he's sliding the puck toward me and I make a futile try to block him. <br>
 <br>
I must throw him off balance, because the next thing I know, we're both falling to the floor. He gives me a look of concern as he hovers over me after landing on me.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Are you okay, Chloe?&quot; he asks. I chuckle and nod. <br>
 <br>
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; I say. I notice that he doesn't seem to be in too much of a hurry to move and I wonder if it's too much to hope for that he might return my feelings. He smirks down at me and I barely resist rolling my eyes. Of course it was too much to hope for.<br>
 <br>
&quot;What do I get for winning?&quot; he asks. <br>
 <br>
&quot;You didn't---&quot; he cuts me off by motioning with his head in the direction of my end of the aisle. The puck made it across. I smile at him and move my head from side to side. &quot;You don't get anything, remember? It was just supposed to be about fun.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You gave me a kiss on the cheek after I completed the movie portion of your curriculum,&quot; he reminds me. &quot;And I had a lot more fun doing this.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I grin and nod.  &quot;I guess you're right,&quot; I say, raising my head a little to kiss him on the cheek. He turns his head and my lips brush up against his mouth instead of his cheek. I pull back quickly, knowing that I can't just give into my feelings for him when he doesn't reciprocate them. I learned that lesson the hard way and I'm not going to let myself completely fall for another guy who doesn't love me. I give him an uneasy grin and he pushes himself up to a standing position, offering me a hand to help me after doing so.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Games,&quot; he says. <br>
 <br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Games---it was the last thing on your list,&quot; he reminds me. I nod in agreement, still stunned from the fact that I almost let my hormones get the better of me. &quot;And I believe you mentioned something about Truth or Dare.&quot;<br>

~*~*~*~*~*~ <br>
 <br>
Lex's POV<br>
 <br>
When she mentioned floor hockey, I knew I was going to win. She didn't know but this Luthor actually went out for sports in school. Well, hockey, fencing, and boxing. And why didn't I lose any teeth over hockey? Well, sometimes the Luthor name comes in handy.<br>
 <br>
I look at her cringe when I take the puck off the shelf and I ask her what's the matter. She explains what happened the last time she played with Pete and Clark and I have a flashback to a movie. Hmmmm---wonder if she's ever seen The Cutting Edge. Former hockey player becomes ice skater to win the Olympic gold that eluded him as hockey player---feisty, hard to deal with skater---becomes his partner in that and love. Oh, Luthor, stop thinking this way---it's not you and Chloe. God, unrequited love, sucks. <br>
 <br>
We play, each of us not giving an inch---me afraid I will hurt her---and also afraid of a puck in the face, like said former hockey player got in the movie, but not so much about the hurt for me, as for her. Her---I guess she's afraid of the repeat of her story too. Then it happens.<br>
 <br>
I'm moving towards her, ready to shoot, when she blocks me so well, we end up falling down---with me on top. Luthor, get your mind out of the gutter and get off her!<br>
 <br>
I back off and ask if she's okay. She says yes. Well, time to ask if there's a reward for winning, I think, as I see I've made my goal. I ask her that and she says I didn't win. I gesture to the puck and she looks, and then turns back. She tells me I get nothing since this was for fun. I said I had more fun watching the movie and she gave me a kiss on the cheek. She acquiesces and leans up, about to kiss my cheek, when I decide---I just have to kiss her---or have her kiss me on the lips.<br>
 <br>
She probably thought I was upset about an old girlfriend when I stopped dancing with her but it wasn't the reason. It was the fact that I had dreamed about dancing to this very song with her. I could never dance with anybody but her to this seductive song, not even Helen. Well, dancing with Helen wasn't that much fun---she kept stepping on my toes. But with Chloe, we anticipated each other's moves---like we had danced before, in another lifetime, a happier time. The other reason I had stopped was that I had this uncontrollable urge to kiss her. Well, I'm not going to let it pass now---just once; I want to feel her warm lips on mine.<br>
 <br>
I shifted a bit and she gently brushed mine. God, this is heaven, I think. But she backs away, giving me an uneasy smile and I feel like I've lost the best part of me again. Hmmmmm---one more chance, Luthor. Remind her of the last part and play Truth or Dare. I suggest just that and we're on our way to the next part of the deal<br>
 <br>
&quot;I don't think they have this game here?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Because it's such a small store, Chloe?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yes, Lex. I don't think every store carries Truth or Dare.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Well then, we'll have to do it without the game. Hmmmm---if I recall during my college days---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You went to college? Who would let you in?&quot; she asks, smirking.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Money talks---frailties walk!&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Ahhhh---Lionel's favorite quote, maybe?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Probably---but let's not bring my father into this. Would ruin the fun mood.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She nods her head. <br>
 <br>
&quot;So, as I was saying,&quot; I reply, letting go of her hand and going over to get the puck, &quot;I remember a bit of this game in college.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;So, that's how you met girls,&quot; she replies, as I walk back to the sports section.<br>
 <br>
I give her a smirk. &quot;No---I went to bars for that.&quot; <br>
 <br>
I hold onto the puck, planning to add it to the growing pile of things I'll be buying tonight, when we go get the rest from the music section, later on.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yeah, right, whatever. I bet Daddy set you up with them.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;No---my father's taste in women, my mother aside, was terrible.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;And the son has inherited it, I see.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Maybe in the past but my taste is getting better.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Oh, do tell. Anybody I know?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You tell me the name of your boyfriend and I'll tell you the name of my girlfriend!&quot; I state.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I'll think about it.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;While you are thinking---let's play Truth or Dare. And no asking the name of our better halves.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Deal!&quot; she states, sitting down on the floor in the aisle.<br>
 <br>
I sit too. &quot;Who goes first?&quot; I ask.<br>
 <br>
&quot;You, since this was your idea.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;All right---let's see---are you still in love with Clark Kent?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Oh, come on, Luthor---think of a harder one.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Nope---are you in love with Clark Kent?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;All right---truth---I am no longer in love with Clark Kent. In fact, I think it was just infatuation. I don't think I've ever been in love with anybody until he---&quot;<br>
 <br>
I sit there for a minute, glad that she no longer has feelings for my best friend and then my heart plummets, when she mentions the mystery he. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Until he?&quot; I ask, plastering on a slight smile that is so false.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Until he---came into my life,&quot; she states, with a smile. <br>
 <br>
&quot;And when did this happen?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Oh no---one question per person.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;All right!&quot; I grumble.<br>
 <br>
&quot;My turn!&quot;<br>
 <br>
I sit there, waiting for her to ask.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Lex---have you ever been in love?&quot;<br>
 <br>
I'm a little stunned by that question. I can't answer it truthfully because I am in love and I would probably blurt out it's her, she would tell me that she didn't feel the same way, and we would both be hurt.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Dare!&quot;<br>
 <br>
She looks at me, sadness on her face. &quot;Never, huh?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Chloe----Dare!&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;All right---dare. Hmmmmmm---okay, let's see---you have to kiss a person in this room.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She's the only person in this room---this isn't fair---although, that mannequin looks like a live person. I get up and walk towards it. I hear her following me.<br>
 <br>
&quot;A mannequin?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;It does look like a live person.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;All right, a mannequin.&quot; Is that sadness in her voice?<br>
 <br>
I purse my lips and kiss the mannequin gently. Then I back away, for the first time noticing a slight resemblance between her and Chloe---no a big resemblance. I turn to the real thing. &quot;This is you!&quot;<br>
 <br>
She blushes. &quot;Yeah, the secret is out. I made extra money one summer to get something for my dad for his birthday, by allowing my likeness to be used for a mannequin. So---want to kiss the real thing now?&quot; <br>
 <br>
The hope in her voice, the shy smile on her face, the look in her eyes, causes me to cave in and state what I wanted to for so long----&quot;I love you, Chloe!&quot;<br>
 <br>
The silence in the room is deafening. Then the sun shines through when she grins and slaps me on the arm.<br>
 <br>
&quot;What was that for?&quot; I ask, rubbing my arm.<br>
 <br>
&quot;For waiting so long to tell me that, Luthor.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Well, I didn't want to make you uncomfortable or to get hurt again.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She leans up and whispers into my ear, &quot;The only thing that was making me uncomfortable was the fact that I wanted to kiss you so badly, that it hurt. And it hurt because I didn't think you saw me that way.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She backs away and I pull her towards me, our lips inches from each others. &quot;Me too,&quot; I say, before I kiss her with all the passion I had pent up inside.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Chloe's POV<br>
 <br>
At first I was hurt. I mean---he chose a damn mannequin over kissing me even when I gave him the perfect opening! How daft is this man? Or maybe he really doesn't like me like that?  Then I saw that it was one of the mannequins they had used my likeness for. Well, at least he would sort of be kissing me.  Oh, no. He's recognized that it's me. Time to tell the truth--- and test the waters.  <br>
 <br>
&quot;So---want to kiss the real thing now?&quot; I can't believe that I summoned the nerve to just ask him that, but the 'night of fun' is almost over and I told myself that I wasn't going to let this opportunity slip by me.  <br>
 <br>
&quot;I love you, Chloe!&quot;<br>
 <br>
What?! Did he just say that he loved me? He not only said it, but it came bursting out of his mouth like he's been holding it in forever. A giddy grin spreads across my lips and I hit him on the arm. He asks what that was for, and I tell him it was for waiting so long to tell me that he loved me. Okay, a little presumptuous on my part probably---but he doesn't seem to be arguing with it.  He says something about not wanting to make me feel uncomfortable or get hurt again and my heart just goes out to him. He really has loved me for a long time---just like I've loved him---and we were both too scared to admit it to each other. I can't believe how much time we've wasted because we didn't think the other would return our feelings.<br>
 <br>
I raise myself onto my tiptoes and whisper into his ear about how much I wanted to kiss him, and tell him that the only reason I didn't was because I didn't think he saw me that way. He says &quot;me too&quot; and before I know it, his lips are on mine.  <br>
 <br>
Oh, God. His lips are even softer than I imagined them. My arms weave up around his neck as he draws me closer and when he darts his tongue out to taste my lower lip, I gladly open my mouth for him. Our tongues slide against each other and the only tangible thought that my mind can wrap itself around is that I desperately need to get closer to him. Apparently he feels the same way, because he's backing me against the wall at the end of the aisle and is helping my leg crawl up his side.  This is---did I just hear someone clear their throat?<br>
 <br>
Lex and I pull away from each other, startled by the sound of somebody else in the store. There's a familiar looking middle-aged man standing there with his arms crossed and a broad smile on his face.<br>
 <br>
&quot;No offense, But it doesn't really look like you two *want* to be rescued,&quot; he says. <br>
 <br>
I blush and try to pull away from Lex, but he wraps his arms around my waist from behind. The man chuckles and shakes his head in amusement. <br>
 <br>
Then it strikes me---why he looks familiar.  &quot;You were in the store before it closed,&quot; I say. <br>
 <br>
He simply shrugs.  &quot;That's my job---I'm the manager,&quot; he replies. <br>
 <br>
Lex crosses from my back to my side, but still keeps one arm wrapped around me, and I slightly shudder at the dangerous look in his eyes.<br>
 <br>
&quot;The police informed you of your employees' incompetence in making sure that the store was completely cleared out?&quot; Lex asks, making it sound like an impending lawsuit.  <br>
 <br>
And here I thought we were having fun. Of course, that's the point---we *were* having fun until this man came and interrupted us. I stifle a giggle at the true reason behind Lex's anger.  <br>
 <br>
The manager doesn't seem at all intimidated though. He throws his head back and lets out a bellowing laugh that echoes through the otherwise empty store.<br>
 <br>
&quot;No-oo,&quot; he says. &quot;Your friend Pete thought I should come and check on you.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Pete?&quot; I ask; a suspicious feeling already building in my gut.<br>
 <br>
&quot;He thought that a few hours locked in a store together would help you two finally admit your feelings for each other,&quot; the man says with a shrug. &quot;I owed him a favor since he got me off the hook with his mom with those parking tickets, and hey---if how you two were going at it when I first came in is any indication, then I'd say his little plan worked. No harm, no foul. Right?&quot;<br>
 <br>
Lex and I exchange a surprised _expression.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Pete?&quot; I repeat and shake my head. &quot;He wouldn't ---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Apparently he would,&quot; Lex says.<br>
 <br>
&quot;And did,&quot; the manager adds.  <br>
 <br>
I know my mouth is hanging open in shock by now, but I don't care.  My best friend, the guy who hated Lex and anything else having to do with the name of Luthor for so long, the guy who ---hang on--- <br>
 <br>
&quot;How did he know that Lex was going to be in the store?&quot; I ask.<br>
 <br>
The man shrugs at me and Lex looks like he's just put the pieces together. &quot;What?&quot; I ask him.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I have a feeling that it wasn't all Pete's doing,&quot; he answers.<br>
 <br>
My eyebrows rise, waiting for an explanation.  <br>
 <br>
&quot;Clark said his mom needed cake mix for tomorrow. She thought she had some, but couldn't find any in the pantry, and---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Lex---you didn't think it strange when Clark asked you to run an errand to the store for cake mix?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;He had stuff he had to finish for tomorrow.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Okay, I buy that; but Mrs. Kent doesn't *use* cake mix. She makes everything from scratch.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;And if you were sent here for cake mix, then why were you buying condoms?&quot; I ask with an arched eyebrow.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Well, Clark and Lana are planning to finally take the next step in their relationship, and I thought---wait a second---I could ask you the same question?&quot;<br>
 <br>
I smirk at him, thinking that the suspicion that I never had a boyfriend is finally showing up. <br>
 <br>
&quot;And here I thought you had that all figured out,&quot; I respond coyly. Uh-oh. Maybe I was wrong. He looks completely serious.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I'll walk you to the phone,&quot; he says, already pushing on my back to get me to start walking. He picks up the puck, putting it into his pocket, and we start towards the pay phones. We stop a few steps into it and he turns to face the manager. &quot;Do you have change for the payphone?&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
~*~*~*~*~*~ <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Lex's POV<br>
 <br>
Oh My God---that kiss---and I was about to do so much more until---God, some people have the worst timing. And then it got really strange---or in Chloe's vocabulary, freaky.<br>
 <br>
Pete set her up---with me? Why---I mean I'm happy it happened but still, why? I didn't think he liked me. And another odd thing---I fell for the cake mix thing? Chloe's right---Mrs. Kent does baking from scratch. Hmmmmm----maybe I was just curious as to why Clark wanted me to do this. Guess I found out why---Pete and he had set us up. Yet, it brings me back to the question once again---why did Pete set us up? I know why Clark did---he's always said I had feelings for Chloe---and I have---explains why Helen and I didn't go far, I guess. So, his part made sense---but Pete?<br>
 <br>
Then she asks me why condoms---and I have to explain it's because Clark and Lana are planning to take the next step in their relationship---like I was hoping we might take tonight, I add in, non-verbally. Then it hits me---why did she get condoms? I mean, after that kiss, there's no way she has another boyfriend. Or does she have one and---no, she doesn't play games. Maybe she had the same idea as I did, about Clark and Lana needing protection? Hmmmmm---I'll test the waters. Thanks, Dad, for teaching me to have a serious poker face.<br>
 <br>
She says she thought I would have it all figured out. Then I put on my serious face and I offer to walk her to the phone---to call her imaginary boyfriend. Hmmmm---Lex, this fun that you've been missing is really allowing you to be a little imp tonight. I stop suddenly and turn around, asking for change from the manager. <br>
 <br>
&quot;You don't need it---you can use the phone in the office.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I state. Then I turn to Chloe. &quot;All right, let's get going and make that phone call.&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;What phone call?&quot; she asks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Why, to your boyfriend, of course. To tell him that he's no longer a boyfriend.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Ah----Lex---about that.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yes?&quot;  <br>
 <br>
&quot;The condoms.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Well----they weren't for me and my boyfriend. See, I don't have a boyfriend. I haven't had a date in ages and well, the condoms weren't for me but for a couple of friends who might need them in the future---like I will ever need them for a long time after this. Because---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Because?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Because I think I just blew my chance with you. God, trust Pete to do this to me---I mention once that I'm jealous of Helen being with you and he remembers that. He doesn't remember that he doesn't like you----he looks beyond that. Why?&quot;<br>
 <br>
I lean towards her and whisper into her ear, &quot;Because he's willing to look beyond his feelings and help you to be happy.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I back away and see her smile. &quot;That makes sense.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yes, it does. And Chloe?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;You have a boyfriend now.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She tears up. &quot;Really? I didn't blow it? Thank you, Lord,&quot; she says, before she launches herself into my arms. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Hey---I want to close up, people. Please, do that at home.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She backs away and we look at the manager. &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Don't be sorry---just be happy. And tell Pete, he's a better matchmaker than you are.&quot;<br>
 <br>
We smile at that. &quot;We will.&quot;<br>
 <br>
He walks away and we follow, hand in hand. She stops suddenly, and I notice we're at the music section again. &quot;What's wrong?&quot; I ask her.<br>
 <br>
&quot;We've got some stuff to pick up and---I wanted to start and actually finish a dance with you. By the way, why did you stop the other one?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I---well, I remember dreaming about dancing with you to the song and it hurt to think that---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;---this wasn't real---that I didn't love you. Oh, Lex, I do---I love you so much---it hurts at times.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;I know---me too,&quot; I state, as I give her a slight kiss.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Ah-hem---time to go, people.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;One more dance, please?&quot; she asks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;All right, one more dance. I'll leave you alone for 10 minutes. Then I want you up front with your purchases.&quot;<br>
 <br>
We nod. He smiles and walks away.<br>
 <br>
&quot;What song?&quot; I ask her.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I've got the perfect song to dance to---perfect because of what you did a while ago.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Play and win at hockey?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;No---kiss a mannequin.&quot; <br>
 <br>
She leads me into the music section and over to the soundtracks again. &quot;Here it is.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She leaves me there and goes over to the CD player, placing the CD into it. She pushes the button and Jefferson Starship flows out of the player. I smile, when I recognize the song from the Mannequin soundtrack---Nothings Gonna Stop Us. She walks back over and into my arms as we start to sway to the song:<br>
 <br>
&quot;Looking in your eyes I see a paradise <br>
 This world that I've found is too good to be true <br>
 Standing here beside you, want so much to give you <br>
 This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you <br>
 <br>
 Let 'em say we're crazy, I don't care about that <br>
 Put your hand in my hand baby don't ever look back <br>
 Let the world around us just fall apart <br>
 Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart <br>
 <br>
 And we can build this thing together <br>
 Stand this stormy weather <br>
 Nothing's gonna stop us now <br>
 And if this world runs out of lovers <br>
 We'll still have each other <br>
 Nothing's gonna stop us, <br>
 Nothing's gonna stop us now <br>
 <br>
 I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you <br>
 Whatever it takes I will stay here with you <br>
 Take it to the good times, see it through the bad times <br>
 Whatever it takes here's what I'm gonna do <br>
 <br>
 Let 'em say we're crazy, what do they know <br>
 Put your arms around me baby don't ever let go <br>
 Let the world around us just fall apart <br>
 Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart <br>
 <br>
 And we can build this thing together <br>
 Stand this stormy weather <br>
 Nothing's gonna stop us now <br>
 And if this world runs out of lovers <br>
 We'll still have each other <br>
 Nothing's gonna stop us, <br>
 Nothing's gonna stop us <br>
 <br>
 Oh, all that I need is you <br>
 All that I ever need <br>
 And all that I want to do <br>
 Is hold you forever, and ever and ever <br>
 <br>
 And we can build this thing together <br>
 Stand this stormy weather <br>
 Nothing's gonna stop us now <br>
 And if this world runs out of lovers <br>
 We'll still have each other <br>
 Nothing's gonna stop us, <br>
 Nothing's gonna stop us now&quot; <br>
 <br>
As the song fades, we back away and look into each other's eyes. And smile,  just before we kiss, wanting to deepen it but knowing our time is limited here. Better to do it in the comfort of the castle, I think, as we back away.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Let's get out of here and back to someplace more comfortable.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;The castle?&quot;<br>
 <br>
I give her a sly smile. &quot;You read my mind, Chloe.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Not your mind---your bedroom eyes, Lex.&quot;<br>
 <br>
I chuckle as I watch her blush from her very sexual innuendo. Then we gather up our purchases and walk towards the front of the store. I stop us at the familiar aisle and pick something off the shelf.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Don't you think Clark has enough condoms?&quot; she asks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Who said they were for him?&quot; I volley back. &quot;God, Chloe---you are so cute when you blush.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She smiles at me. &quot;And you are so cute when you're happy. By the way, Lex, you've just graduated at the top of your class. And now---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;---for my honorary degree. Come on, let's get going and I'll show you how to have some serious fun.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yes, teacher of all things erotic,&quot; she states, as we walk swiftly to the front. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Chloe's POV - Clark's Birthday Party<br>
 <br>
 <br>
&quot;Clark!&quot; I yell and wave my hand in the air as I enter the room. He smiles, but he looks nervous---and he definitely should. I could really lay into him if things hadn't worked out for the best. I make my way over to him and give him a smile and a hug. &quot;Happy birthday.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Uh---thanks,&quot; he says, pulling back and smiling uneasily. &quot;So ---&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;So---I'm sure Lex told you that we figured out that you and Pete set the whole thing up?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;He didn't,&quot; Clark says. &quot;And it was mostly Pete's idea,&quot; he protests, holding his hands up like I'm going to hit him or something. <br>
 <br>
I let out a light chuckle and shake my head.  &quot;It's okay, Clark.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;It is?&quot; he asks, looking a little confused. I nod. &quot;So---did it work?&quot; he asks sheepishly, shoving his hands into his pockets. I smile broadly.<br>
 <br>
&quot;It worked,&quot; I confirm. His face contorts into a genuinely happy __expression, no longer ill at ease about the situation.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Thank God,&quot; he says not quite under his breath. I laugh and then smile at Pete as I see him walking over. He looks back and forth between Clark and me hesitantly.<br>
&quot;Everything okay, here?&quot; he asks. <br>
 <br>
Clark turns around and smiles at him.  &quot;It worked,&quot; he says. <br>
 <br>
Pete smiles at me and then at Clark.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I told you it would,&quot; Pete says proudly. <br>
 <br>
I cross my arms and narrow my eyes a little at him.  &quot;How long have you been planning this exactly?&quot; I ask. <br>
 <br>
He chuckles nervously and slaps his hands together.  &quot;Hey!  It looks like everybody's here! How 'bout we do presents?&quot; he asks loudly, directing his attention to the small crowd of friends and family as he ignores my question.  <br>
 <br>
&quot;Cake comes first,&quot; Lana says chidingly as she walks up to our small group, &quot;Everyone knows that.&quot; She gives me a knowing smile before turning and walking away.<br>
 <br>
I feel arms circle around me from behind and I turn my head a little to look at the man I know it is.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Hey.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Hey,&quot; Lex says back. Pete clears his throat and Lex arches an eyebrow at him. &quot;Problem, Mr. Ross?&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;Just because Clark and I set you two up, it doesn't mean we need to see---&quot; he pauses and motions negatively toward us with his hands, &quot;---*that*.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Lex chuckles and tightens his grip on me.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Well, you're out of luck then---because I intend to spend a lot more time doing *this*.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Pete grumbles, but the _expression on his face quickly changes to one of elation when he sees Lana and Mrs. Kent coming out with one of the biggest chocolate cakes that I've ever seen--- all lit up with candles for Clark's birthday. The singing starts and I'm a little surprised to hear Lex joining in.  'Guess I really did rub off on him a little,' I think happily. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Happy Birthday to you,&quot; the last chorus rings throughout the room and Clark draws in a breath to blow the candles out.  <br>
 <br>
Dear Lord, what just happened? The top two layers of the cake just blew off and went flying through the air, landing in several small splats across the party guests who were standing opposite of Clark. I watch my best friend blush and duck his head.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he mumbles.<br>
 <br>
Lex and I exchange a look, but say nothing. We've both learned with Clark that it's easier to just let things drop sometimes than to press the issue. He'll tell us his secrets in his own time, and that has to be enough for now. <br>
 <br>
Besides, we're about to get him back---Pete has shoved our gag gift at him as the first one to open. I must admit that I'm a little embarrassed now. I hadn't been thinking about his parents being at the party when I agreed to go along with this, although I suppose in retrospect that I should have been. I watch as Clark greedily rips open the paper and then his eyes seem to grow ten times their size when he sees what's inside.  <br>
 <br>
&quot;I---uh---&quot; he stammers, his mouth hanging open and all the color draining from his face.<br>
 <br>
 Pete bursts out in hysterical laughter; so much so that he starts clutching his gut with his arms.  &quot;Oh, man---the look on your face---tell me someone got a picture of that,&quot; he says. I snicker and Lex just grins at Clark.<br>
 <br>
&quot;They thought it might give you a push in the right direction,&quot; my boyfriend says and motions with his head toward Lana. <br>
 <br>
A bright red hue quickly covers Lana's face and Pete laughs even harder, if that's possible. <br>
 <br>
I shake my head lightly in amusement and frustration as Clark and Lana share yet another one of their pining yet faraway looks.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Geez, Clark.  Just kiss the girl already,' I blurt out.<br>
 <br>
 He looks at me in surprise and I feel Lex's body shaking a little with the laughter he's holding in.  <br>
 <br>
I turn my head and smile at him. &quot;Let it out, Hon. You're allowed to have fun at a birthday party.&quot; <br>
 <br>
I watch his lips slide into a muted smile and he brings his mouth to mine to kiss me. We barely kiss before he pulls away slightly and smiles against my lips.<br>
 <br>
&quot;How much fun?&quot; he asks suggestively.  <br>
 <br>
&quot;Hey!&quot; Pete yells. &quot;Still in the room!&quot; Lex and I both snicker and Pete folds his arms across his chest as he turns his attention back to a very embarrassed Clark Kent. &quot;Well---you heard Chloe---just kiss the girl already.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Clark opens his mouth to speak, but no words come out. <br>
 <br>
Lana takes a few steps, closing the distance between them. She has cake all over her, but somehow I doubt that Clark will care.  She smiles brightly at him and he leans down to kiss her.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Finally!&quot; Pete, Lex, and I yell at the same time. It strikes me that a few other people chimed in on our sentiment and I smile at Pete.<br>
 <br>
&quot;We did good,&quot; I say.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Ah, ah, ah,&quot; he says, wagging his finger at me. &quot;*I* did good. I got you two together too.&quot;<br>
 <br>
&quot;He's got a point,&quot; Lex says and grins lovingly down at me.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Yeah, he does,&quot; I say.  <br>
 <br>
Lex and I kiss again and Pete doesn't even try to interrupt us this time. Instead, when we pull away, I notice that Pete looks happier than I've seen him in a long time. Everything comes back to you. Pete making his friends happy made him happy, and maybe someday we can return the favor. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Already going through a list of girls you can set him up with?&quot; Lex whispers to me.<br>
 <br>
 I look at him in surprise.  &quot;How did you know?&quot; I ask.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Easy,&quot; he answers. &quot;I've gotten to know you.&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
The End. <br>
