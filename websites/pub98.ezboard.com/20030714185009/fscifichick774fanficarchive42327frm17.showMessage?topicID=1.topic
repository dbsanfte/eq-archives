This and the previous chapter were great. I had thought everything was going to be okay as all the couples seemed to be more-or-less happy and everyone came back to reality, but Chloe had to open her big mouth about Clark! <br>
Looking forward to the next part of this although I'm assuming we're near the end of this particular story given they are all back in the real world again? Well, I don't mind the end coming so long as it's happy<br>

OMG---I read the last part you posted for this piece and I tell you---heehee---she remembers the father. : ) After she kisses Lex. Boy, does she have an odd mind throught process. &lt;bg&gt; But that's your Chloe---very strange with the thoughts. &lt;vbg&gt; I loved it, sweetie. And I know all are going to miss this story, most of all. : ( Just remember that the two best words in writing is The End---because that means you have accomplished your goal---to write a great story. And the next two best words---that never show up in a story---but is in your heart always----The Beginning. Can't wait till you start your next epic. &lt;g&gt; <br>
 <br>
As to Accidents Happen----boy, Lex is a real tiger, isn't he. That's our boy---try the less than subtle approach when it comes to the woman he loves. :: grrrrrrrr :: This was an incredibly angsy chapter but then Angst leads to love. Thanks for posting both these pieces on list. : ) Talk to you later. Maybe my muse will allow me to get some stuff out tonight. Your friend, Peggy. <br>

Hi! <br>
<br>
I hope you don't mind, but I decided to email you and express my thoughts on your continuing fabulous story ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.  As an introduction, my name is Kathy and I am a big fan of the stories you write for SMALLVILLE, in particular your more romantic CHLEXY stories.  I absolutely adored the following stories:  Lovestruck, Gatehouse, Propisition,Sibling Rivalry and of course, Accidents Happen.  That is why I decided to email you.  Your slightly cryptic comments at the beginning of Chapter 15 has caused me to start too worry.  Is it possible that you are contemplating a non-ChLex end to your otherwise wonderful story???   Say it's not so!!!!   I highly enjoy your writing style, particularly the racier aspects of the story<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I truly enjoy the idea of Chloe and Lex being together, romantically being the ideal. I wish the show would actually pair Chloe and Lex up, or at least put them in more scenes together. <br>
<br>
I just wanted to let you know to keep up the great CHLEX writing and to keep raising the ratings of your stories as high as you can get away with<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I hope you don't think I am completely insane.  I am simply a big fan of Smallville, Chloe and Lex in particular, and the wonderful fanfiction that places them together in any position &lt;naughty grin inserted&gt;.   <br>
<br>
Please have a good day and I hope I didn't disturb you. <br>

Oh, sweetie, just read the last part and I think you did all right with your Lana and Clark voice. Poor Jerome---well, he'll find somebody, someday. It's too bad that sometimes when two people fall in love, somebody else is hurt. : ( Just look at Clark and Lana in the series. And Chloe in the series. Do you get the feeling that Chloe loves Clark, Clark loves Lana and Lana might be in love with somebody else. Pete, not Lex. : ) Really don't see that pairing considering Lex spent a lot of time trying to get Clark and Lana together. Oh, where did I get this idea---remember she said to Chloe it's not my fault that Clark has feelings for me----she never said she had feelings for him. Ah what a tangled web we weave when we practice to disceive. Just paraphrasing but I tell you, this says it all for Smallville. Talk to you later. Your friend, Peggy. <br>

  <br>
Sorry about last night---got bumped out of my own chatroom---what's the world coming too. &lt;g&gt; <br>
 <br>
I just wanted to tell you that I went over to Malu's site and checked up on your continuing WIP and loved it. So, loved the scene between Victoria and Lucas. I'm really starting to like this version of yours of him. : ) And then her walking in on Lex and Chloe. &lt;bg&gt; And Lex having her escorted out. You know, I think I'm going to have to do a sequel to Who I Am because I forgot that Victoria moves into the mansion.....hmmmmm.....do you suppose that maybe she would refuse to move out and Chloe would go upstairs and throw her stuff out the window. : ) Talk to you later. Your friend, Peggy. <br>

Ha---the fastest healer in the world is Chloe. : ) OMG---this was so worth the wait and soooo hot! : ) And Alexander was a touch jealous of Clark---heehee---this kinda reminded me of Hans Solo before Leia said----he's my brother. That look of happiness I saw in the movie, I could see on King Alexanders right then and there. And Alexander telling Chloe to go to Whitney---sob. He's even selfless here. : ) Thanks for a wonderful chapter, Kris. Can't wait to see what you've got in store for us next. Prolific Peggy. <br>

Well, the angst queen has struck again, guys. &lt;g&gt; I think that Lex was very much in character for somebody who is under the influence of something---just remember how Clark acted in Red and in Rush. Not to mention Chloe and Pete. Mind you, Lex is a bit more reserved but you know, still waters run deep. And eventually, those bottled up feelings have to come up. Wonder how it will happen on the show? You talk about the Hazel Fury showing up---Lex would be right up there with Chloe. &lt;g&gt; <br>
 <br>
Loved this part, Kris. And I know in my hurt, Chloe will be okay. Prolific Peggy. <br>

But now with Chloe's memory gone, and Lex being in Intensive Care, and Jack apparently liking Chloe <br>
more than you let on before *gives pointed look*, I can't wait to see what you have in store for us next. ^_^  Yay for this story! *dances*<br>

~~&gt; Heh.  Yeah, it was about the same length as the first couple of chapters of the fic.  They started getting progressively longer as I wrote more chapters and with this world - ugh.  I like the Chlex aspect, but I'm horrible at writing Clark and Lana, as they are not my favorite characters on the show.  I even thought about sending them home first (since some worlds' timelines are faster/slower than others) and I think I still might.  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Yeah I don't really enjoy them as much I as I probably should with the show surrounding their relationship and all that. <br>
 <br>
Hmm that is a good idea though. Of course if you send them home, we'll see less of the Chlex form that world, which I also adore... *g* Can you write the Chlex of that world even if Clana has gone home? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Poor Clark, all confused again. I felt a little bit sorry for him <br>

This was really nice, having just the two of them in the Talon seemed very symbolic to me, of how alone they both really are, but they found each other so it all worked out. Let's just hope the writers see sense and get rid of the doctor soon, and at least let Chloe and Lex be friends, if not more than friends.<br>
<br>
Lovestruck (Part 32)<br>
With parents like Chloe and Lex and the fact that she was only pregnant for like a week definitely makes those little girls <br>
originals. Looking forward to the epilogue although I'll be sad to see this story end because it's so good.<br>

Heehee---I knew he was her lobster----as Phoebe of Friends calls soulmates. Heehee---you go, Lex. : ) And poor Clark thinking this is a side affect---NOT! It's just let down their guards and now, they can admit they love each other, get married, have kids, that will drive Daddy Lionel to the asylum and all will be well in Smallville.

The commesnt at the end of part 30 about Lex's driving made me laugh, but the rest of all this - wow. Poor Chloe went through a lot with the whole pregnancy thing happening in just a week and a half and then giving birth to twins. Great couple of chapters though and I'll bet Lex will make a great daddy. Looking forward to the next chapter.<br>

I think this may be my favourite of your stories.  I'm not sure why, but something about it just clicked, a very sweet moment without being overly sappy.  On an unrelated note, I had to laugh when Chloe's new car showed up on Tuesday night.  I live in Vancouver, and it seemed rather suiting, as there were more VW bugs sold in per capita in Vancouver than anywhere else in the world when the new ones <br>
were released, and they are pretty much ubiquitous around here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
