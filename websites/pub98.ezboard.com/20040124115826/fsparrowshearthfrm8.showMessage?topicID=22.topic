This man, Jack, is a self-made construction company owner and a Christian.  He made the statement from the very beginning that he would tithe his winnings between 3 churches that were dear to him.  Since then it's been interesting to read the paper and see letters to the editor voicing the opinion that the church should not accept this 'dirty money'.<br>
<br>
Does it matter where your tithe comes from?<br>
Should the church not accept winnings from gambling, or does the church have the right to even ask where it came from?<br>

It is hard to make the distinction, but I'll give what is (at least) my opinion.<br>
<br>
Lotteries are generally run by &quot;the state&quot; or some other charitable organization.  Here in Canada we have lotteries organized by hospitals or the Cancer Society (for example) where tickets are $100 each, but you have a 1 in 15 chance of winning a prize.  The prizes are either houses, cars, cash or minor prizes worth at least $250.  In those cases, you know the proceeds are going to a worthwhile cause, which (IMO) makes participating in such a lottery acceptable and winnings would not be &quot;dirty&quot;.<br>
<br>
In the case of &quot;state&quot; lotteries, most people see it as a form of voluntary taxation.  The revenue from the lottery sales goes into the government's budget to be used for health care, education, infrastructure, etc.  People are voluntarily giving money to the government, but with a chance to win something back (If only income tax worked that way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
The next thing you can have (at least this is the case in Ontario) are state run casinos.  Similar concept to lotteries, some people see them as voluntary taxation as the profits (gambler's losses) go into the government's budget for use just like lottery proceeds.  Unfortunatley, casinos are much more likely to lead someone to a gambling addiction than a lottery, so in some sense I do see &quot;state&quot; casino winnings as &quot;dirty money&quot;.<br>
<br>
Finally, you have the casinos that are like the ones in Vegas.  Privately owned, where the proceeds (read gambler's losses again) go entirely to the profit of the company.  Since no real good comes out of the money that gambler's lose I usually regard any winnings from a private casino as &quot;dirty money&quot;.  There is no mitigating factor in the trasaction to even remotely make the situation palatable.<br>
<br>
I hope that made sense.  Oh, and just as an aside, lottery winnings in Canada are tax free. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man<br>

<br>
I pretty much agree with your take on things, but would disagree with this statement.  WV is a fairly poor state  and many would argue that our lottery feeds the addiction of way too many apart from our casinos--which are few and far between.<br>
<br>
I thought it was a wonderful testimony that this man is giving so much of his winnings to the church, and I hope they all welcome his gifts.<br>
<br>
Tithing, at least as I understand it, should be between you and God; I don't believe the church fellowship should be so audacious as to question the origins of the tithe.<br>

i agree too that tithing is between the giver and god, unless it was a bizarre case of money being given to the church as a result of illegal activity in which case it would be between the giver, god, and the cops...<br>

Gambling is something that can lead to an addiction like beer can, and it needs to be done in moderation if it is done at all.  The complaint against gambling comes from the protestant work ethic, and the idea of gambling winnings as getting something for nothing.<br>
If betting on chance is bad, then how do Christians view day traders on the stock market?  What is the difference between gambling on stocks and gambling on who wins the Kentucky Derby?<br>
My priest joked with me after a Serbian won the Washington State lottery and bought a church for the Serbian parish, that some one in our parish won would tell him I am moving to the south sea islands it has been nice knowing you!

BINGO!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Spent less money than going out to eat or watching a movie, had a couple of hours with my girlfriend talking, while blotting numbers.  I did it for enjoyment.  Bingo is big business here in Kentucky, most of the Bingo's are church or charity organized.<br>
I don't see a difference between that and playing the lottery.  If I'm going to spend on it, it's for a chance to win but I'm not expecting to win.  Also, here in Kentucky, lottery proceeds are supposed to go to education, although I don't know how or where to find out how the proceeds are spent.  It's also like anything else, if it becomes an addiction in any way, it's trouble.  All things in moderation right?<br>
<br>
I remember the interview they did on Jack, when he won the lottery, seemed like a really nice man.  He had a reputation for taking care of his workers if I remember the interview correctly, so him contributing to churches just seems to follow from what he would normally do.  Like having a windfall placed in his lap from many jobs and extra money to contribute to causes he thinks are worthy.  <br>
<br>
Churches accepting money, I've not heard of one declining money?  And even if the money was ill-gotten, say from drug runners and so forth (which would seem strange to me that someone who was into those types of things would contribute to a church?), all it amounts to is cash that can be spent to help those in the church or community?  How would accepting cash or donations necessarily be condoning how the person came to have the money to contribute?  So unless the contribution was a way to gain influence (which is wrong anyway) or to control the church itself (which is also wrong), why/how would it be a problem?<br>
