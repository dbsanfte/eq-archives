<br>
The first topic was...<br>
<br>
Name Changes on Role Play Servers - Many of the changes that have happened recently have been purely because Mythic has finally waded through the 11,000 complaint backlof of name appeals.  If you feel your name has been changed unfairly, take it up with dispute first, and then Sanya if you don't get resolution there.  This is also the case for names that you try and appeal but get the message &quot;Already approved by a CSR&quot; such as the name &quot;Handsome BWonderful&quot;  that you feel were not properly approved and need to be looked at again.  Sanya also commented on the fact that if your name is changed on the fly by a CSR, you can retroactively appeal/dispute to get the name changed to a new one of your choosing. (That meets the TOS)  Sanya's comment was - Before we used to get emails about names that were horrible and why weren't we doing our job getting rid of bad names. Now I get emails from people complaining that we're changing names like they wanted us to.<br>
<br>
Some areas such as the Hibernian Protest were discussed in detail.<br>
<br>
Summary (in my words, not quoting from Sanya)-<br>
<br>
Quests.  The protesters were correct, there is a disparity in the type and number of quests and Mythic is working on correcting that problem.<br>
<br>
Fomorians.  The protestors were correct.  Fomorians were replaced only in those places that were pure formorian camps, but not where there were mixed camps.  This was a design decision.  The previous Mythic response was based on just those full camps when they said the fomorians had been replaced.<br>
<br>
Chalk line on the edge of the epic zones.  Problem in different places in all three realms.  Not something likely to change.<br>
<br>
Esthetic/Design issues with hibernia buildings, etc.  Mythic understands the issue but this isn't something likely to be addressed.  Causing 250,000 people to download a 15-20 meg patch to &quot;pretty things up&quot; just isn't going to happen.<br>
<br>
Hibernia Dragon - This dragon has been killed on some servers.  In tests it is working as intended, and is killable.  However, Mythic is continuing to look at it for possible changes.<br>
<br>
Numbers Quitting/Active - Sanya said she had about 2 dozen people that were sending her anails, and about 6-7 dozen who send in feedback forms.  But she said she spotchecked the accounts of some people who posted on the boards they had cancelled, and some of those people had not cancelled, and in some cases had even renewed.<br>
<br>
Class balance issues - It usually takes 3+ months to work out class balance issues, and just because you don't see changes right away doesn't mean they aren't being looked at.  But it also means that sometimes classes will not be changed, even if in the opinion of some users they are under/over powered.<br>
<br>
Respec Stones - Sanya she's pressing for additional ways to get respec stones into the game.  The addition of the stones as drops in Epic dungeons is one part of that.  As there are a lot of players that don't belong to large guilds or alliances, she'd like to see ways for those folks to get respec stones as well.  <br>
<br>
Population/Realm Balance Issues - Could not really be discussed as to what was being done in these areas.  The comment was that the real difficulty in dealing with a problem on one server with one realm can easily create the opposite problem on a server where that realm is in the majority.<br>
<br>
Bugs - People come to the boards and post about bugs and bizarre drops that they got and then salvage the items.  But when Mythic checks the bug logs for bizarre drops or items, the que is empty.  If people want these kinds of things to be fixed, they need to fill out bug reports saying what, when, what monster dropped it, etc.  They can't do anything about it if they don't know anything about the details.  &quot;Some monster somewhere in Jamtland or Odin's&quot; just isn't enough detail.<br>
<br>
Sending Emails about Game Issues/Bugs/Imbalances/Etc - If you want your email or feedback form to be useful and get paid attention to seriously, then you have to submit logs, send in bug reports, send concise letters and not ones filled with flames about issues and problems. Get your own data, not just rely on &quot;Well, XXX told me it happened to him.&quot;  Sanya will read letters filled with profanity or flames, but no one else at Mythic will, and they certainly won't get forwarded to the development staff or higher management.  Thinks like spellchecking, normal english, decent grammar and sentance structure make a difference.  In other words... if you want a serious response, send in a 'professional' kind of submittal.<br>
<br>
It wasn't all fluff and bull from Sanya's part as some people would have you believe.  Yes there were areas that Sanya couldn't talk about in detail.  Part of that falls under the don't promise somsthing you can't deliver. So until things come out of development, she can't go into details. She delivered some hard answers about things Mythic doesn't plan to do anything about.  <br>
<br>
Thats my summary from my notes and memory.  I put the audio tape on CD tomorrow in the production studios.<br>
<br>
One final note - For the folks who think it's easy being interviewed &quot;live&quot; on the air - no delay and no tape recording/editing for broadcast later - drop me a private message and maybe for a future show I'll put you under the spotlight live on the air and see how well you do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenter>Kelryck's DAoC Role Play Community & Story Archives</a><font color=#3333ff> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fkelrycksdaocradioandroleplaycenterfrm12>Questions, Topic Suggestions, Show Guest Suggestions</a> <font color=#3333ff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
