I haven't researched this yet, but it's been on my mind for something like years.  <br>
<br>
Why do we have a 'viewing' of our loved ones'  bodies after death?  I can only recall 2 services where this WASN'T a part of the memorial service.  In place of an open casket, the family had literally redecorated the funeral parlor/church with precious photographs of the deceased, displayed medals/trophies they had won over the years, had old yearbooks out and such-- it was a WONDERFUL  atmosphere and the life of the individual was celebrated in such a beautiful way...I think it would be nice if this were the NORM!

<br>
When my mom died, I said straight out that I would not go to any viewing and we opted for closed casket. We had only one picture of her among the forest of flowers that had been sent.<br>
<br>
Well, the evening of the viewing, the night before the service, my sister's were going to be there. They went and when they say my mom's body, they burst out laughing because it didn't look like her at all. The hair was wrong, the makeup was ridiculous, etc, etc.. They called me and said I HAD to come because it really helped them to know that Mom wasn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>there</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.. So, I agreed and when I got there, they were redoing the hair. There was my one sister hanging over the body going &quot;Mom! They've made you up like a clown! We're going to fix you up&quot; When she went to fix the lipstick, because of the imbalming, the mouth went wacky.. and it stayed. So, that led to more laughter. (I'm sure the folks thought we were all drunk or on drugs or just plain crazy) Finally, after working the mouth back into a semblance of what her's looked like, my mom's body was what we deemed &quot;acceptable&quot;.. and we got ready for the people to show up. After, I could honestly say it DID help. Of course, we know where she is, and we will see her again some day.<br>
<br>
Then next day, at the actual funeral, we all were missing her horribly.. but thankfully, we'd given the pastor her Bible. He was able to make a wonderful service. NO one left that building not hearing the Gospel. That was her wish... and she got it BIG TIME. <br>
<br>
After there was a reception at the church. EVERYone shared stories about how Mom had touched their life. I think we went through 6 boxes of tissue.<br>
<br>
Then, those that are close family and friends went to my Dad's, where we all were staying. We were up the whole night talking and remembering and laughing and crying. <br>
<br>
And, now some 3½ years later, we still have our &quot;Mommy Moments&quot;. I can't get through the hymns anymore. I just stand there and cry. But, that day... oh my gosh... she gave us <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>another</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> memory.<br>
<br>

<br>
I think we do that so we can get one last look at the one we love before we never see their face again.  The only people I can think of that have closed casket are if they were too disfigured or something.  Like they had been in a bad wreck or something.<br>

I think it depends.  I think if the person wasn't a Christian, I couldn't feel anything but deep sorrow for their death.

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;">When I arrived in England I was appalled at the British attitude to death. To die seemed to be almost an act of indecency—if you had fallen so low as to die, then there were special people who would come, undertakers, to pack and wrap you up for the funeral. Then two weeks or so later there is a nice memorial service in which one sublimates one’s feelings into a kind of spiritual realm. Then I remember that I went to preach at the University Church in Cambridge on the subject of death and a priest there told me he had never seen a dead person. Why is there this morbid attitude to death? In a natural way one does not get rid of people through the back door! If death is nothing but defeat, the end of life, it is not pleasant for the family to look and think it will happen to them soon. Of course, if you have a wrong attitude to death, it becomes more and more horrible and frightening. I remember another incident. An old lady died and the family telephoned me and asked me to come because I was a friend. I arrived but could see no sign of the children. I asked why they weren’t there, because in the Orthodox Church the children always go to the dead person and the coffin is left open. The mother said, ‘They will be terrified, they know what death is.’ It turned out that quite recently the children  had seen a dead rabbit which had been crushed by a car, and the parents thought they would be frightened if they saw granny. I asked if the children could come in, <br>
otherwise, I said to the parents, they might always have this frightened attitude to death. Eventually the parents agreed to let the children come into the house and we went up to the room where granny was lying. We stood beside the bed in silence for a while then one of the children said, ‘How beautiful granny looks’. Death was no longer something frightening, something to be dreaded.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Orthodox always have open coffins, the reposed is still a member of the Church, only that they have gone to their reward.  In an Orthodox funeral, everyone in the parish will go up and venerate and kiss the body.  There is nothing morbid about death, what is morbid is how we hide it, refuse to deal with it.<br>

<br>
Whenever the subject came up. the rare times I've been <br>
asked how I'd like my corpus treated, I have said the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish to be cremated, mixed with tobacco, and smoked by<br>
my closest friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
This invariably silenced the room, especially since I said it <br>
with a deadpan delivery. <br>
<br>
Inasmuch as I know there are sick people out there who<br>
fiddle with corpses, I'd prefer a cremation to anything else.<br>
I know some people who have religious objections to it,<br>
but I'm not aware of any Biblical injunction against it.<br>
Some people have said things about the resurrection, but I<br>
figure that God won't run out of power reconstituting me.<br>
<br>
That didn't address the question, though.<br>
<br>
I'd rather be remembered as I was ALIVE, rather than as a<br>
dead body.  I understand some people get a sense of closure<br>
seeing the body, so I suppose that's fine.  I like the idea of<br>
pictures and remembrances up as well.  I've said that I'd <br>
hope somebody'd be sorry to see me go, so they'd shed a <br>
tear, but I'd also hope that someone would really remember<br>
me, and laugh as well.  I've even toyed with the idea of<br>
hiring a comedian to ensure that, but I concluded it would<br>
just come off crass. <br>
<br>
I've heard of even worse ideas, though...and had a few.<br>
<br>
I STILL don't get calling it a &quot;wake&quot;, when if that actually<br>
happened, everyone would be VERY surprised...<br>

An alternative is something I just heard about last year. There is a company that will pack the ashes in fireworks. Two boats go out to sea, there is a party on one, with the friends and family of the one IN the fireworks.. who is on the other.

WHY is cremation forbidden?<br>
<br>
Is a Bible verse quoted for the reason?<br>
Is this a &quot;the church fathers of yore have commanded it&quot;?<br>
Please look it up and get back to us when you get a chance.<br>
<br>
<br>
If memory serves, <br>
Orthodox Jews have to have the body buried pretty quick.<br>
(I think that comes up once per every crime tv show's run.)<br>
<br>
I know they MOURN a death, (&quot;sitting shivah&quot; and so on)<br>
but I don't think they feature the body.<br>
<br>
<br>
Femme, I like the methods you mentioned.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On another note, as Snopes has pointed out, there is a<br>
company that claims to press your loved one's carbon into<br>
a diamond.  However, it's a LOT cheaper to produce a <br>
synthetic diamond, destroy the evidence, and CLAIM it's<br>
your loved one's carbon, and there's no way to check. <br>
So, how much do you trust them, I ask?<br>

Fr.  Olof Scott......<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What Scripture supports the Orthodox Church's ban regarding cremation?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Following the disobedience of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, we have God's final words to Adam: AIn the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return. (Gen. 3:19) This is seen as the normal end for A man in both the Jewish and Christian traditionsBburial in the ground and natural decay.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Burning the dead was only considered by the Jews to be an extension of the death penalty for an officious crime: AIf a man marries a woman and her mother, it is wickedness.  They shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there may be no wickedness among you. (Lev. 20:14).  Otherwise, to burn a dead body was considered a pagan practice.  The Jewish Talmud prohibits the burning of the dead, and according to this practice our Lord Jesus Christ was buried.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Christians and Jews understand that humanity is created in the image and likeness of God.  And, that creation includes a body, soul and spirit.  It would be disrespectful of God's creation to abuse it by burning.  The closest New Testament argument against cremation would be the writings of St. Paul regarding the resurrection of the body (I Cor. 15).<br>
<br>
The strongest argument for our practice of burying the dead is the fact that Jesus was buried.  And, we anticipate the resurrection of the dead because Jesus was resurrected.  We are treated as Jesus Christ because we are members of His body. (Eph. 5:30) <br>

What if a pledged member is financially unable to have a full funeral and chooses cremation instead with a memorial service in the church?  Is this permissible? </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
First of all let me correct a misconception.  Pledging or paying has nothing to do with who is eligible for an Orthodox funeral in the church.  They must have received the sacraments of confession and communion within the past year even if they pledged or paid nothing.<br>
<br>
Expanding on what we've reviewed previously about cremation, the Orthodox Church holds the body in high regard, because our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ's body was buried and resurrected.  The end of an Orthodox Christian's life is a process, undergoing a series of prayers and services, inside and outside the church: prayers for healing, Holy Unction, prayers when illness increases, prayers at the departing of the soul from the body, prayers after the departing of the soul from the body, Trisagion prayers for the deceased, the funeral service, Trisagion prayers at the burial, memorial prayers on the 9th day, 40th day, and first annual anniversary.  And, in continuing memory of our departed, families remember them on the anniversaries of their deaths in the Divine Liturgy as we await the resurrection.<br>
<br>
One who is cremated is prohibited from having an Orthodox funeral service in the church.  There is no body remaining over which we can pray.  And, since the process outlined above has not been respected, why should their family desire a memorial service in the church?  We can pray for them as we do for all deceased, but a formal memorial service would be inconsistent with what they have done.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fr. Nicon Patrinacos in A Dictionary of Greek Orthodoxy writes: A...the Orthodox teaching regarding the communion of the living and departed members of the Church should be kept in mind.  Believing that death is not the end but the beginning of a new life, the Church holds the position of a continuity of life from the moment of birth to the time of the Second Coming of the Lord.  Hence, the close bond of the Orthodox between the living and the dead expressed by memorial services, perpetual care of graves and the survival of the names of parents in the persons of grandchildren.  The Orthodox Liturgy is offered for the remission of sins of both living and dead, and the eternity it promises extends far beyond the grave not only in terms of time but in terms of the living of the dead in the memory and conscience of the Church.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Orthodox who contemplate cremation do so because of high costs resulting from a combination of funeral industry services, coffins, vaults, grave sites and the laws/regulations governing burial of the deceased.  The only remedy to reduce these costs would be to return to the Orthodox practice of no embalming and burial in a simple casket within twenty-four hours. <br>

I'd have to echo TommyT's post above, there were people that were really alive, but were presumed dead and that is part of why the 'wake' was substantiated.  There is a lady on the net that loves little historical tidbits like this, I'll send her an e-mail and see if she has more on the subject.  You have to remember years and years ago there were no funeral homes and these 'wakes' happened at the homes of the people who died.  I know one of the subjects this lady posted about was even about tying little bells to the people who were buried to make sure they were dead, the bells remained tied to the person for several days after the funeral had taken place.  If the bell rang they knew to dig the person up.  Also, from memory, when it was too cold the burial couldn't take place right away here in the states at least.  It explained why some burial dates and actual death dates conflicted where geneology was concerned.  I was told this happened with my great-grandfather.  He was put in 'cold storage' until the ground thawed enough to bury him.  <br>
You mentioned the Jewish tradition of wrapping and using herbs and spices for burial, I'll try to look that up as well for you and see what I can come up with on it.  I found it interesting though that corpses didn't remain in the tomb but were put in estuary boxes eventually.  It may be though, that different areas came up with different ways of dealing with the dead, that would be my guess.<br>
