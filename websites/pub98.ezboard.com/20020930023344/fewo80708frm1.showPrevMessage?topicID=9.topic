The Rock slides into the ring and then climbs all four turnbuckles before grabbing the mic in the corner of the ring. The Rock try's to speak but the fans are chanting Rocky, Rocky real loud. The crowd dies down as The Rock begins to speak.<br><br>&quot;Elix Skipper, you want to come out here run your jabroni ass on priiiimetime this and priiimetime that, well The Rock says this, Elix Skipper, The Rock is going to lay down the smack it down on your roody poo candy ass. You call yourself a CFL Champion, well The Rock is up for anything your ass could come with because The Rock also played football! So Priiimetime, The Rock says this, The Rock says as soon as The Rock is done kicking everybody's ass to become the champ, The Rock is coming after you. The Rock is going to give you the biggest smackdown The Rock has given, and you know when The Rock is gonna give it, The Rock is going to give that beating on Rooockkk Time, yes that's right, The Rock is going to put it on Rooockkk Time when the lights dim and the show begins The Rock is a different person. The Rock is the people's champion. So Primetime, when The Rock burns down your house, then what are you going to do. When your built house is done then what is Primetime going to do. You see Primetime, nobody likes you and if your house was ever to burn well then what would you do? Would you go to The Rock's house. Well before The Rock would let you in, The Rock would have to give you a little test. He would have to take a sausage. The same sausage after Triple H himself pulled it out of his ass. The Rock would make you lick it first just to shine it up. Then The Rock would turn it sideways and stick it straight up your candy ass. So Primetime, you better build another house because The Rock is burning it down. IF YA SMELLLL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKIN?&quot;<br><br>The Rock drops the mic as the fans are cheering. The Rock slides out of the ring and then walks up the ramp. The Rock leaves as the next match is about to go underway between two jobbers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=10.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=10.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.threadControl?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ewo80708frm1">eWo RP Board<option value="ewo80708frm2">eWo OOC Board<option value="ewo80708frm3">eWo Nitro<option value="ewo80708frm4">eWo 2 NighT</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bewo80708>eWo</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fewo80708frm1>eWo RP Board</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
