<br>
Meanwhile, Laurena's sobs had lessened.  She sat up, but her head was hung so that no one could see her face through her long hair, or the burning hatred in her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hopefully...somewhere out of the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena stood up, the dagger in her hand.  She walked past Aeli, pausing only a brief second, and not even looking at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't let her do this anymore.  If she wants me...that's who'll she'll have.&quot;  Her voice was dark and grave, and void of its usual kindness.  &quot;I may not come back...but what do I have to lose?  My life?&quot;  Her shoulders quaked in a humorless chuckle.  &quot;Goodbye, Aeli.  I love you.&quot;<br>
<br>
And she stormed out into the early morning.<br>
<br>
Azalea ran outside after her.  &quot;Laurena! Come back!&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena didn't listen.  She only clenched the dagger tighter and headed in the direction where she somehow kne that Tryphaena was waiting.<br>

She didn't notice Laurena comign until she was several yards away, and automatically her lips turned upward in a smile.  But when she saw no Lance, and a dagger in her hadn and a glaze of fury in her eyes, the smile quickly changed to a look of shock.<br>
<br>
&quot;You bitch!&quot;<br>
<br>
Tryphaena didn't react quick enough.  Laurena lunged at her and slashed at her across the chest with the sharpened stone, leaving an ugly gash there.  She let out a shrill cry of anger before slamming her down on the sand and biting her shoulder, drawing much blood there as well as her nails dug and scratched at her skin.<br>
<br>
Laurena held the dagger close to her throat, too close, it cut the skin and made Tryphaena shudder, unable to move.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've had it!&quot; she shrieked in Tryphaena's face.  &quot;If you want to kill me, go ahead and kill me! But don't go and destroy the lives of everyone I care for!!!<br>
<br>
&quot;Lance is dead now.  You can't reach him anymore, I've made sure of that.  And you'll never kill Aeli.  He's strong and brave and everything I will NEVER be!  But that does not mean that I can't kill you in cold blood, because I can and I will!&quot;<br>
<br>
Tryphaena took all of this without interruption.  But when Laurena was finished, she began to cackle, even with the dagger held to her throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go ahead, then, if you're so brave,&quot; she mocked.  &quot;Kill me.

If Aeli had his way, Tryphaena and Laurena would be at peace...He would at  least try. <br>
<br>
He caught sight of them, slowly making his way to them, step by step. His hand was clutching his bow, but hopefully he wouldn't need it.<br>

&quot;I'm a failure...I should die.&quot; <br>
<br>
She looked up.  Aeli was standing there, bow in hand, looking like a lost child.  Her eyes softened, for somewhere in the storm of rage within there there was a person who still had compassion and mercy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli...?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tryphaena took this chance to throw Laurena off of her.  Laurena tumbled to the ground, but was up again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aeli...get out of here!&quot; She yelled at him over the wind.  &quot;Just go!  I...&quot;<br>
<br>
Tryphaena lunged at her and she dodged, drifting up into the air.  She flew over to the cliff, staying low so that she wasn't carried away by the wind.  Tryphaena may have been stronger, but Laurena was the smaller and faster of the two.<br>
<br>
She wasn't givign up without a fight for Aeli.<br>

<br>
She sped off, Tryphaena chasing her.  Tryphaena's whip came out and lashed at her wings, confining them painfully.  Laurena crashed at the edge of the cliff, the dark siren landing only a few feet away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tired of playing games, Laurie? Or do you want more?  Either way, I'm gettign that necklace.&quot;<br>

Laurena looked at her, and then the cliff's edge, down at the raging sea below.  &quot;Either way...yes...&quot; she whispered.  She turned back to Tryphaena.  &quot;No more games, Tryphaena.  I'm tired of playing with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, good girl.&quot;  Tryphaena took a step forward.  &quot;do you remember when you were a little girl, Laurie? Always playing games.  You loved them.  But i would always beat you.

Tryphaena laughed at Aeli's petty words and Laurena's expression.  &quot;Surprised, sister?  You should be...since I'm the one who kiled our parents.  But you didn't know that, did you?  Do you even remember?  Do you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena found she was having trouble breathing.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do,&quot; she cackled.  &quot;In that quaint little run-down village to the east...Ostona, was it?  Everyone died horribly, of course.  Including Mother.  And Father.  And you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you get it yet?&quot; she snapped.  &quot;You are just like Lance.  You're dead.  You're not supposed to be living.  The only reason you breathe is because of that ankh on your neck.  Without it, you're nothing, and with it you're nothing still.  Just a ghost of a scared little girl who played too many games.&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena had gone a ghostly white.  Everything was startign to make sense...the dreams of fire and blood....the ankh...the reason why she could never remember her childhood...<br>
<br>
She didn't feel real anymore.<br>
<br>
She heard Tryphaena cackle, but she didn't care for it.  She only stared at Aeli, tryign to find some comfort in his eyes.  But she still felt dead, a mere shade.<br>

She wanted to die.<br>

<br>
&quot;Because,&quot; she said calmly.  &quot;The dark sirens are the true dominant species of the siren race.  But did the gods deem us worthy? No!  We were far too wild.  So they create bronze winged trash who have no desire to fight for themselves.  That was when She came to me...and told me that power awaited for anyone that obeyed her.  Anyone that was willing to fight.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then Laurena spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're being used, Tryphaena.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tryphaena looked at her.  Laurena had only gone paler, and looked ready to die.  Her voice was soft and gentle, wih no blame or any emotion besides curiosity.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're being used.  What do you think She will do when you have restored her to life?  She will toss you aside.  She will use you and toss you aside when she has no more use for you.  Don't you realize that?&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed.  &quot;If you want the necklace...you can have it.&quot;  She looked into Tryphaena's eyes.  &quot;But you'll have to come get it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What...?&quot;<br>
<br>
Laurena locked eyes with Aeli, a look of deep resignation on her face.  She folded her wings tightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love you...&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, Laurena spread her arms and fell backwards over the cliff.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nooo!!!  The necklace!&quot;<br>
<br>
Tryphaena flew after her, disappearing over the edge with her.<br>
<br>
And both were gone.<br>

&quot;NO! LAURENA!!!!!!&quot; And then he couldn't speak. But he could still run...and run he did, and jumped off the ledge.<br>
At least he could hold her during her last breaths...<br>
He dove into the water, luckily missing the rocks. His head burst onto the surface and he immediately spotted his love. She was pale and bleeding...<br>
&quot;Laurena.&quot; His heart was more than stabbed and ripped. <br>
Quickly, he swam to her, not able to avoid all the rocks. Finally, he reached her and grabbed her, getting out of the rocks as best as he could. When they were in the open ocean, not to far from shore, he wrapped his arms around him, letting the waves wash the onto the sand of the beach. He was worn now, and very weary. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#060C65><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyonaefalcona>Kyonae Falcona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 741<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(7/20/03 3:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm74.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=153>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aeli: *dies*</span><hr size=1> Azalea had just appeared on the top of the cliff, and looked down.<br>

<br>
She teleported down to the shore.  Aeli was in the water, holding a whited winged figure that was tattered and pale...<br>
<br>
&quot;Laurena!&quot;<br>

<br>
Laurena felt numb to everything except for Aeli's arms around her.  She felt them wash up on the shore...the sun rose upon them, but she had a feeling she would not see it set.<br>

&quot;I wanted you to live,&quot; she sobbed.  &quot;Please don't, Aeli, please...&quot;  She felt the world fading.  &quot;Don't die.  Live...&quot;<br>
<br>
She couldn't speak anymore.  She sobbed against him, glad he was there, but knowing that she had died in vain.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love you...live...&quot;<br>
<br>
And with the last of her strength, she pushed the ankh against him.<br>
<br>
And her world slowly faded to black.<br>

Azalea came upon them.  She found Aeli, barely conscious, with no wound but a bloody shirt.  <br>
<br>
And huddled up alongside him, clutching the Ankh, was Laurena, as still as stone.  Her eyes were still open and gazing lovingly at Aeli.<br>
