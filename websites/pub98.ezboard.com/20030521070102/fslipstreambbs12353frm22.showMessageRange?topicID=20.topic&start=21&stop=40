<br>
Actually, I understand you point and believe it or not, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>HF</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> tried the same line of logic on me.  He was very stubborn about me not leaving Ex.  But he couldn't stop me.<br>
<br>
But the truth is, I had a few friends from SS who ended up exclusively at Ex and what with being busy with RL and here at SSU.. I just didn't notice that they had made the choice to 'never' come here.  <br>
<br>
Once I had a chance to go back over there and I read what was being said about SSU ...... I felt personally betrayed.  <br>
<br>
There's no need to explain to me what certain people 'think' is up with SSU.. They believe there is a TK connection, they dislike HF .. whatever......  That is their choice.  But it just wasn't true-- none of it.  It would have been different if some poeple had just said they prefered Ex to SSU and left it at that, but that wasn't what happened. <br>
<br>
My involvement at EX became pointless..... Each time I read something negative about SSU there, it felt like a slap in the face- a personal slap.  <br>
<br>
Add to that that some people I wanted to stay in touch with seemed to be otherwise occupied.<br>
<br>
And most of the people I wanted to stay in touch with, were also on this board.  <br>
<br>
I knew I would just end up defending myself and SSU in so many little ways... and the discussions over policy and the ML.. well I would not have been any different that HF..... We were pretty adament about secret forums here..... how could we not be the same there.......<br>
<br>
And the sentiment seemed to be that we were not really members, but coming over form 'over there' to try and enforce our opinions on them.. It all seemed so pointless.......<br>
<br>
It's no one's fault, as I said there, the memberships fell out along friendship lines with many belonging to both boards. And this is MORE NORMAL than any of you can know......<br>
<br>
I just saw that, well there just wasn't anythign left there for me--other than to defend my choices--or ignore them! I felt there was nothing for me to contribute or enjoy that I couldn't right here.  It was not a choice made in anger and I meant every word I said in my last post at Ex.. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I believe both administrations stepped up to the plate and tried to make a home for  displaced SS'ers....... We all deserve some recognition for our efforts....... I gave that recognition to them....... I was impressed with their efforts......</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Still, I was hurt by several things and continue to be.. I feel my own motives and work here was placed in a negative light, even tho my name was never mentioned.  I hurt me!  That is all there is to it!<br>

I'm ready to chime in on this issue finally, and I don't think anyone is going to appreciate my opinion, but hey... you know what?  SSU is ALL ABOUT freedom to have any dAMned opinion that you want....<br>
<br>
and you know what?<br>
<br>
I think this whole thing is BULL$HIT.  <br>
<br>
Has anyone ever thought about what the whole POINT of there being two boards IS???  <br>
<br>
Here at SSU, people WANT a much freeer expression.  Well, you know what?  I'm not all that damned free.  I tend to be moralistic, and prude.  And I LIKE ME that way. I'm here as a moderator for 2 reasons only - Cait wants me to be here, and I firmly believe that an independent fan board paid for and supported by the members is the best way to go.<br>
<br>
THERE at EX ISLE, people want SLIPSTREAM!!  And they want it with as little change as possible - just a sense of assurance that there won't be the big problem that we had at slipstream, but they also WANT the same sense of comfort and security that the moderating style gave.   AND, perhaps the sense that &quot;someone else&quot; is taking care of it...<br>
<br>
Whatever the case may be - (and all the above is just my opinion) - the two boards have two totally distinct characters and people should be able to accept that this is the way it is, without trying to make either community any different than it is.  IF Ex Isle is going to blow up the way SSBBS did, that's sad, but you know what?  We DON'T KNOW if that will happen, and in the meantime, we have SSU!  So we would LIKE Ex Isle to be different, more open and so forth, but we are the minority.  <br>
<br>
We EACH need to face the reality of what has been done - the community that WAS SSBBS has created two new communities.  They will diverge down their own paths, and that's how it should be.  But if WE here at SSU need to spend time griping and complaining about Ex Isle, then I need to resign my post.  I'm here for SSU, NOT for Ex Isle.  Any complaining I've got to do about Ex Isle, I'll do AT Ex Isle, because I'm a member of THAT community too.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the incoherence, and the profanity.<br>

I feel very similar.  We'll be fine <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>QT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. we will ...... all of us..... Ex and SSU.<br>
<br>
Like I said there and I will say here... Both board administrations and memberships stepped in when there was nothing except ruin.  How can we not respect all the people (regardless of which board they are on)..... that contributed.<br>
<br>
As for your participation........ Yes, I want you here and would do almost anything to ensure you continued to enjoy yourself here.  I'm selfish that way! I want my friends close.<br>

Well, a lot of it is personal, Gode, but I think Rhea showed it best by describing us as &quot;the SOBS who are responsible for bringing down Slisptream&quot; or something to that effect, and then there's Rov's &quot;I wouldn't have anything to do with a board founded by Troll Kingdom&quot;. And a dozen other little snipes elsewhere.<br>
<br>
And for the last time, Troll Kingsom did NOT bring down Slipstream. I was there, dammit; all that OQ stuff was just suddenly dumped in the middle of another conversation we were having. C &amp; L brought down Slipstream, no one else is responsible for that. <br>

my impression is that SSU staff and founders belief therw was something inherently wrong with slipstream and the way it was modded, Ex-Isle by way of contrast has staff and admins who lay most of the blame for the demise on the way Lisa ran things.<br>

it's a very minor difference and most definitely two sides of the same coin, but it is a difference and one large enough to affect the way people view each other.<br>

<br>
Cait, I know EXACTLY how you feel.  I spend so much time defending my &quot;home and family&quot; to people that there are times I just get cranky. (gasp!!  can you believe it???)<br>
<br>
Finally I came to realize a couple of things.  First of all, not everyone is going to like every board.  Some people NEED to have close moderation and structure and others don't want any.  I think most people fall somewhere in between...usually leaning a bit more one way than the other.  It's why there are biker bars as well as chruch picnics. A mixture of the two just isn't going to be comfortable for everyone.<br>
<br>
Second; there is no way to defend your 'home' to others.  The best way for acceptance is for you to make sure that everyone is welcome and that you provide the atmosphere for them to have fun. Word of mouth will do the rest.  People will be curious and lurk and if they see people having a good time, (and notice the place isn't overrun by eeeeevil TKers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) they will want to join in.  If they don't join in, it's because they just don't belong ( you may talk the nun into getting on the Harley, but I really doubt she will get a tattoo!! ).<br>
<br>
SSUG isn't for everyone and no matter what , you can't make it that way.<br>
<br>
Now have fun.... or...or....I'll have to troll or something!<br>

<br>
Ultimatley, your description is exactly why I decided to just come home and try and make this a board we can all have fun on.  <br>
<br>
I wanted to make it better, to make EVERYONE happy, but after a while I knew it just isn't the way things are in RL.<br>
<br>
I agree, the best thing *I* can do is make 'my home' a welcoming place and those that peek in and like it will stay.  And I'll be able to meet and greet new people as they arrive.<br>
<br>
It's why I just came home, I'd rather spend my energy here.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the understanding, I appreciate it so much.  You know since we've begun SSU, one of the best things that has happened is, getting to know you better.  <br>

<br>
Thank you Gode I really appreciate you saying this. But after what happened I really don't think I can post there. The only way I could do so is if I never express an opinion on anything and it's impossible to do that. I thought I might be able to if I just avoided discussing matters relating to the board but that's not going to work either. <br>
<br>
The fact is that unless I'm completely indifferent every time I post on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>any</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> topic I'm going to be giving a perspective on it even if it was something as inocuous a topic as the last book I read for example. I'm going to be giving <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>my </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> perspective, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>my</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> point of view, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>my opinion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. And  that's not because I want to ram my opinion down anyone's throat, start trouble, bend everyone to my will or something, it's the same for everyone: when a person comments on something they will generally give <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>their own</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> perspective on things, not someone else's, not the person down the street but theirs.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for me there are some people at Ex Isle who'll get pissed off at me and start accusing me of trying to cause trouble no matter what I say or do or what my intentions are. It was the same at SS before it's demise: people who'd usually never actually said  two words to me before in all the time I'd posted there suddenly deciding that they know me well enough to be able to rip my posts apart, word by word and know for a fact there were hidden intents and agendas behind them, people who couldn't be bothered to take the time to actually have a conversation with me and get to know me deciding that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>they</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> knew what <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->thought or felt about something and that I didn't. Yeah like they're all psychic or something. It often got to the point where I wrote and re-wrote my posts before submitting them, going over the smallest detail, nervously trying to make sure nothing could be misconstrued.<br>
<br>
Back then I had the energy to handle that. I don't anymore. I'm <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TIRED</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->!!!!!! I have a very demanding job. You wouldn't think so, it's only 3 hours a week sitting chatting to an old lady. Except that the old lady in question is blind, mostly deaf, and suffers from an advanced stage of vascular dementia. So those three hours are the longest hours of my week and they feel like a full 24hrs, seven day a week job. I'm basically employed to sit and watch sombody die slowly and to try to keep them happy and assuage their fears about what is happening. Often she doesn't know I'm there and even if she does she frequently doesn't understand what I say to her. But the worst thing is in her more lucid moments she understands only too well what is happening to her.<br>
<br>
On top of this I study for two university level courses, have a child to bring up and I'm trying to kick start a writing career. Yet according to some people on Ex Isle I apparently don't have anything better to do than to go posting on their board trying to start trouble. Where precisely am I supposed to get the time and energy to do this?<br>
<br>
I don't even have the time nor energy to post on a board where I'm made to feel so unwelcome let alone go trolling it. I wasn't even going to post there often in the first place. I just wanted to try to help prevent any bad feeling between the two boards. My being there really was intended as nothing more than a goodwill gesture: one which I now feel has been thrown back in my face.<br>
<br>
But what really annoyed me was that this all happened amidst posts about how Ex Isle is soooo much different to the old SS, yet some of us are getting the exact same treatment we had at the old board.<br>
<br>
That all said thank you for your kind thoughts and I'm sorry you got dragged into this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003B75><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bslipstreambbs12353.showUserPublicProfile?gid=godeskian>Godeskian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#0000ff, Strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wise Guy</span></td></tr></table></span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#EFD68C>(2/15/03 8:53:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fslipstreambbs12353frm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: sigh.....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes, it's a real shame that most people will never know what great people most TKers actually are.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

and i guess that sor of sums it up doesn't it. Having read your post, i can only imagine how much you are trying to juggle at the same time.<br>
<br>
I can see some of it in my sister (who holds down a job and three university courses) plus painting. <br>
<br>
and while i understand your decision, i do regret it. Plenty of people post opinions without getting them attacked, some of those are very strong opinions as well, so i don't know why it's you (and to some extent as splash) HF.<br>
<br>
I do think Ex-Isle is a different place than the Slipstream is, but it seems no one is willing to let people try and prove it. <br>
<br>
Are we likely to stumble? yeah, we probably will, but as long as we do hang in there, i'm sure we can pick up our pace again.<br>
<br>
Will mistakes be made? sure they will, heck mistakes happen, there isn't a BBS out there that can claim differently.<br>
<br>
However i have to believe that we can make the Ex-Isle work,  because i honestly believe that we have a good bunch of people there. I just think it's a shame so many people aren't going to be there,<br>

You truly are one of the best.<br>
<br>
BTW I don't think anyone would expect you to give up on anyone you choose as your friends. I sincerely wish there was a way I could post there, Cait and 3 eyes as well, maybe it might be possible eventually but right now I just can't see it happening.<br>
<br>
All I can say is I'll think about giving it another shot at Ex Isle, however if I do go back there and this sort of thing happens again that's it. There won't be a third time.<br>

My delayed joining was due to not being able to get in this joint!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Both boards are great.  I've seen people hint hint on both boards but I must confess, I haven't seen this outright board slamming in either spot.<br>
