As reported by William Garcia - 2001<br>
<br>
August 17th 2001, the night’s main event, and it had to be a drama queen Toreador. Thomas George of clan Toreador has got himself, and perhaps the rest of us in a bit of a bind. On his first night in town (see case number – SC007), attempted to break domain because of an artifact fell into his hands after a scuffle in blood alley. It turns out the Tork (necklace) is very magical, and dangerous. Dangerous, not just because of what it can do, but because who want it.<br>
<br>
Mr. George explained to me that a society of “relic hunters” wanted this item and were willing to kill him and or all of us to get it. He suggested that we just give it to him, I agreed and when we went to hand it off to his contact. Only problem is that his contact was dead by the time we got there. Shortly there after, we found out that the Tork could not be removed from Thomas’ head and amplified his powers. The rest of the night was a total waste, following him around on a wild goose chase. He is currently in the sewers, until some more light can be shed on the subject. It is the option of this officer that more time and life will be wasted on this investigation before it’s all over.<br>
<br>
As of August 24th 2001, the situation has gone from bad to worse. Seneschal De`Ange and Primogen council banished him from the city. Shortly they’re after the Tork kicked into high gear presumably taking over Mr. George. I received a report from Sunday that Mr. George was running through downtown with great speed. I then received a report from Deputy Riddel that he was at the harbor. <br>
<br>
I then proceeded to the harbor with Bruce and Mr. Stumpwater. We found Mr. George’s boat in birth number 26 aflame. Mr. Asheart (who invited himself to the scene) and Bruce got into the water with Mr. George. Shortly there after, a small tidal wave threw the both of them out of the water. The force of the wave wounded Mr. Asheart; Bruce seemed none the worse for ware. After getting back on shore Bruce informed me that he believed that the Tork had taken over Mr. George, and was capable of unleashing a cataclysm upon the city or farther. The Seneschal has ordered everyone to stay back from Mr. George, while Bruce’s “friends” take care of it.<br>
<br>
My guess is that once again, we can expect more pain, death and breaches to come of this damned necklace and Mr. George. I also suspect that we will never know where the necklace ends and Mr. George begins. <br>
<br>
<br>
It’s Thursday August 30th, 2001. I’ve been doing research into this piece of demon jewelry. I’ve contacted the UCSC anthropology department and had a talk with one of their professors of Egyptology. From there, I’ve begun to contact museums in San Jose, San Francisco, and Seattle. The only real piece of information that I’ve learned, that the academic community does not believe that this object should exist. It’s apparently displaying traits from more than one culture and believes it to be a fraud. But they wanted to prove it, so they sent it various academic institutions to be analyzed. It seems that this thing was inert until activated by kindred (Mr. George) presence or perhaps some other part of his mystical nature. I’m going to continue to try and talk with these mortal institutions and hopefully dig up some usefully information. As of right now we have very little to go on.<br>
<br>
Friday, August 31st, the fun with this guy just never stops. At approximately 10pm a car with a blonde Norwegian sailor was parked on the sidewalk. The man was clearly a vampire with a neck wound of some sort. Mr. Asheart and Venom climbed into the car and drove away. I found this to be an interesting development, given despite this is the second time that he has done this in two weeks, Mr. Asheart is still not sheriff. I’m not sure if he knows this? <br>
<br>
I called Mr. Asheart’s cell phone number, and he was “kind” enough to take this man to The Five at my suggestion. Upon arriving at the scene, a kind of not quite real “show” appeared before us. It involved ships, necklaces, a lady and a bunch of other stuff I did not quite understand in the slightest. I did not understand the how, why, what this all means or really anything associated with this particular surreal moment. Then all of a sudden Darla, in what I can only speculate was part of an actual plan summoned Mr. George to us. Sadly from what I can tell, no actual plan existed. Mr. George then punched down the wall of the Five, the five feet of solid concrete, gone in one blow. Then some more smart people got the idea to attack him… it only served to prove the point that we can’t deal with this thing head on. I can only hope that Mr. Wyte, or my research will be able to come up with something.<br>
<br>
On a final note for the evening, this whole fiasco seems to have attracted the attention of one Lily Montgomery who claims to be Brujah, unofficially working for the Camarilla and have the Camarilla wide status of Fearless and Cherished. Some believe that she has ulterior motives. Specifically she wants to use the power of the tork for herself. <br>
<br>
September 5th 2001, I’ve done extensive research on Chinese mythology. I’ve found reference to a Chinese demon named Wan-fu. He is rumored to be was according to being an evil, cruel and prideful man cast down into the underworld/hell.<br>
<br>
I’ve also uncovered historical documentation on our item dating back to a small New England town named Crockshollow in 1784. Soon thereafter the town burned down. The Tork then surfaced again in 1976 in the hands of a man who killed his whole family. From there it went into the hands of the police, then to the Seattle museum of natural history to SF harbor where it disappeared.<br>
<br>
I’ve been asking myself; over and over again what does this thing want? Why is it in Santa Carla? I don’t know, what I do know is that it’s very dangerous and seems to leave a wake of destruction in its path.<br>
<br>
On September 6th 2001 went to meet an expert of the subject. His name is Jim Lee, and he did seem genuinely concerned about getting this demon “Wan-fu” destroyed. He also emphasized that we should stay as far away from this thing as possible until a plan has been formulated. He seemed well informed regarding the events that go on around him, he even know my name before I told him. <br>
<br>
On September 7th 2001, I received a phone call from Mr. Lee. <br>
He informed me that a Crewman named James Bulivan of the ship “Richard's Pride“ went missing on July 17th from his ship at port in San Francisco. I believe that finding out the fate of Mr. Bulivan will lead to addition information on the puzzle that is this necklace.<br>
<br>
Or not, the investigation has turned up that Mr. Bulivan in the Santa Carla morgue. What this means, I’m not really sure. I will however continue to follow up this lead, as it is my only one.<br>
<br>
On the 14th 2001, a representative of Mr. George came to our populous meeting to address the populous. Mr. George’s representative stated that Mr. George was claiming the bay as hisdomain. All are banished in his domain, with the exemption of Prince Ferrera. Prince Ferrera representative by having me slap the messenger on his behalf.<br>
<br>
I am pleased to report that this matter came to a close on the night of September 21st. A sorcerer by the name of Nathan Day, who claimed to be a will-worker. He told me that he with the help of a Tremere servant named Tim. After a few hours the two of them got together, found a power spot in blood alley and did their thing. The ritual went off separating Mr. George from Wan-Fu. Mr. Day grabbed the Tork and ran. A few others and myself leveled Mr. George and some of his Childe. Mr. Riley Stanton of Clan Ventrue claims to have taken care of the mess with the police.<br>
<br>
Mr. George shortly there after was turned over to Sunday, and then to Prince Ferrera took the right of the 6th on Mr. George for breach of all six traditions.<br>
