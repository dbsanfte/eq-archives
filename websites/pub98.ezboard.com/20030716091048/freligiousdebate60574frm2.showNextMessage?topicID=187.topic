No shit--I was slowed at a light to get on the next freeway and did like 3 double takes just to be sure. I didn't see whether it was PeTA, but notices something about going to www.vegeat or something like that .com. I thought of bringing it up here, but got sidetracked and then I go to THIS beauty of a link on another atheist board...(THIS IS GROSS AND VERY INSENSITIVE SO PLEASE VIEW WITH CAUTION---SINCERELY) which actually compares the holocaust with animal slaughter for meat. <br>

While I concede that kosher laws make cow slaughter more painful and tortuous than it need be, I just honestly don't see how these folks think this is appropriate or in any way convincing or persuasive. It's so over the top that only an extremist already on their side would be able to refrain from vomitting.....wouldn't they? Anyone else want to just withdraw any support or avoid ever starting to these sickos????<br>

<br>
Anyway, with that scary fact revealed, I think the PETA people are pretty much the fundies of the animal rights movement and I think they do a disservice to their cause with some of the stunts they pull. A couple years ago, I remember them getting in the news because they stood outside McDonalds and gave away &quot;Unhappy Meals&quot; to children complete with bloodied toy cows and fake animal parts covered in presumably fake gore (though it apparently looked pretty realistic). And I saw an interview with the lady who runs it (Ingrid something?) and she kept saying things like &quot;a rat is a dog is a cat is a boy&quot; so that pretty much cemented my feeling they are extremists.<br>
<br>
I think we should treat our environment respectfully and to me, that includes the animals who live in said environment. However, I think in a realistic world, using animals in medical experiments which could one day save the life of somebody's baby or spouse or mom or dad is a good thing. And I don't see meat eating as in intrinsically immoral act.<br>

I think we need to recognize that our earth is here for us to use responsibly.  Killing animals for  testing beauty products or for sport is unnecessary, but if a medical breakthrough can only be tested on animals to guage its effects on humans, than I think that's a reasonable purpose.  Eating meat (whether bought in the store or hunted) is simply keeping with the whole food chain idea--just as plant life is here for us to consume, so are animals--but I try to buy products from companies that practise responsible farming (free-range, hormone-free, vegetarian-fed, etc).<br>
<br>
I agree also that PETA's tactics put a black mark on animal-friendly activist groups and organisations.  Way over the top.<br>

I was a vegetarian (tho not an activist) for 8 years and am very aware of the animal abuse that goes on in factory farming, health &amp; environmental issues involved, etc. I think &quot;Diet for a New America&quot; should be required reading in highschool. It never bothered me that other people ate meat, but the amount of denial I saw some people in did trouble me. I have more respect for someone who shoots a deer, processes it and uses it to feed his family than someone who buys meat at the store and doesn't even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>want</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to have a clue where it really came from or how it was treated its short life.<br>

Well I was agreeing with everything on this thread until that quote.  Killing a child in or out of the womb IS child abuse if the nerve cells are functioning.  Just because it is inside and dependent on a woman does not mean that a fetus cannot feel.  Ripping it apart limb by limb is Not humane by any standards.  Do you think that a switch goes on at birth that starts the feeling and thinking process?   <br>

Comparing abortion to the holocaust is extreme, IMO, but it is still slaughtering innocent defensless tiny humans. - Shirene<br>

I sure hope you're never faced with the awful choice between continuing a pregnancy knowing that when you give birth you can stand by helplessly watching your child suffer, struggle and die... or going the humane route and ending his suffering  via abortion, then spending the rest of your life being slammed by mornonic statements about abortion being &quot;child abuse.&quot;<br>

Actually, the ability to really process and feel pain kicks in around the third trimester. I'd go look up the med references for you, but I have a living baby to look after. <br>
<br>
And please apply your same logic here and tell me whether circumcision is child abuse? I seem to recall you were all for that despite the extreme and unnecessary pain involved.<br>

Unfortunately, some abortions are performed with the method I described.  As far as brain development and body systems being in place.  Brain activity can be detected as early as day 40 on an ECG<br>

<br>
I checked a number of sites (go to ask jeeves and put into fetal brain activity) and most literature is that by the end of the first trimester nerves and brain are functioning.  They have rem sleep and everything.<br>
<br>
I think your situation is one of the acceptable situations as far as abortion, but there are other reasons and methods that are far from humane and IMO likely to be extremely painful to the fetus. <br>
<br>
The great circumcision debate - I think we have hacked that one to death.  I guess the same logic could be applied to immunization, stitches, ear piercing, surgery.  These are all choices that are made with the hope of a  postive outcome.   Whereas abortion doesnt have any intention of having a positive outcome for the child. <br>

Shirene,<br>
You seem to have confused fetal brain activity with the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ability to feel pain</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. They are hardly synonymous. This quote is actually from one of the (non pro-life propaganda) links you provided:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Others define responses before 26 weeks as <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>reflexes without conscious appreciation</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and suggest that only after 26 weeks is it likely that a fetus not only reacts to, but also consciously experiences pain. Although it is accepted that the thalamus may assume some functions to contribute to fetal awareness of pain, no one is yet positive when the brain is mature enough to register pain. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that practitioners who undertake invasive procedures at or after 24 weeks consider the requirements of fetal analgesia.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's 24-26 weeks, or the third trimester. The vast majority of abortions are performed in the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>first</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> trimester when the ability to process pain in not yet in place.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Edited to add:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> In the relatively few abortion procedures taking place in the second or third trimester, if it is an L&amp;D there is no &quot;fetal pain&quot; involved as the fetus is delivered intact. In a late D&amp;E the mother is usually under anaethesia which also anaethetises the fetus. It is also common for doctors to cut the umbilical cord first in a late D&amp;E procedure. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guess the same logic could be applied to immunization, stitches, ear piercing, surgery. These are all choices that are made with the hope of a postive outcome.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You can't compare routine infant circ to immunization or (presumably necessary) stitches or surgery. The only &quot;positive outcome&quot; it confers is to the parent who dislikes the foreskin and is misinformed about its function, or the doctor who gets paid to amputate healthy, normal tissue. Ear piercing also confers no positive benefit to the newborn, and is done only to satisfy parental vanity or desire for cultural conformity. Even so, the relative pain, risks and damage of ear piercing is minuscule compared to that of circumcision. <br>
<br>
BTW, have you read anything about infant brain wave patterns/pain response during circ? Do a Google search on that and see how humane you think it is. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I know you and I will never agree about circ and I am sure everyone on this board is tired of the subject so I'm sorry I brought it up and I'll now drop it. <br>

They throw the word around like it is some new buzz term.  This also takes the shock value away from the experience, and I feel that people need to focus on the actual Holocaust in terms of acknowledging how dark human nature is capable of being.  Comparing it to abortion or eating meat devalues the lives of the Holocaust victims (all 12 million, not just the Jews), and it turns people away from the cause at hand.  <br>
<br>
As for this whole eating meat thing, I totally understand why some people don't eat meat, but our bodies were still designed for meat consumption.  Vegetarians and vegans find alternates for meat, but in general our bodies require a certain group of nutrients.  Humans are not herbivores, we are omnivores.  Eating meat is a natural part of human life in the biological sense.  I think people lose focus of that because we gussy up our food nowadays, and we tend to forget the real reason why we eat certain foods.  <br>
<br>
As for the kosher process, I have never kept kosher, so I'm not an expert on the matter, but I do know a few things about it.  Part of the reason animals are slaughtered the way they are for kosher purposes is because many people consider it MORE humane than the alternative.  The whole purpose of being kosher is a spiritual one.  Non-kosher meat is slaughtered by people standing there and banging cows over the head.  Kosher meat is slaughtered by a quick slice to the throat, and the animal gets a quick shock first in order to not feel the pain.  Hunted animals are also not considered kosher because religious Jews feel that it is wrong to find sport in killing.  They feel that killing an animal for food is a necessity, and people shouldn't take any joy in the killing of another living being.  One of the big purposes behind kosher meat is to make it to where the animal has the minimum amount of suffering.  <br>

At no point were we discussing various notions of &quot;when life begins.&quot; Heck, some people think &quot;life begins&quot; the minute a horny guy makes eyes at an ovulating woman. So back to your initial assertion: You said abortion was inhumane because brainwaves can be detected at 40 days and therefore being &quot;ripped limb from limb&quot; was &quot;inhumane.&quot; I said it was not inhumane because brain wave activity is not synonymous with the abilility to conciously <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>feel pain.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Now you're saying ONE STUDY argues the fetus may feel pain as early as 9 weeks. Check your calculator, that's a lot longer than 40 days.<br>
<br>
So, when DOES life begin? Conception? Detectable heartbeat? Brainwaves? Fetal viability? Birth? At 40? Are you arguing abortion is wrong because it's painful, or wrong because it ends a life? How did a thread about PETA turn into an abortion debate?<br>
<br>
Stacey, <br>
We've gone far afield, thanks for bringing back the original topic. My understanding of kosher killing in a factory farm setting it that it's pretty brutal. They hang the terrified cow upside down FIRST (not uncommon for the leg to break), then slit its throat and let it bleed to death. Sure it's more sanitary but it doesn't make humane in my book. I read about this in the book &quot;Fast Food Nation.&quot;<br>
<br>
I support hunters because at least those animals get to live a normal life first, and for whatever &quot;joy&quot; the hunter takes at least he knows where his meat is coming from. BTW I don't hunt and neither does my husband and I hate the flavor of venison. Too gamey.<br>
<br>
FWIW I completely agree with you that the holocaust stands alone, and the horror of it is diluted and human lives cheapened when people use it to promote political agendas whether pro-animal or anti-abortion.<br>

This is pretty much what I've always read about it as well.  It has always seemed to me to be the way an animal would experience the minimum amount of pain because they are out like a light pretty quickly.  Also, from what I understand, the process of stringing the animal up is pretty quick.  They do it just as the animal is being stunned and cut.  I do see how the process can go awry and cause the animal to have her leg break though.  <br>

I just want to reiterate that I have never kept kosher.  I tend to gravitate towards kosher meat if it is available, but that is because I know it has been more closely inspected and will be less likely to cause food poisoning.  It has nothing to do with the Jewish part.  My dh has always been the same way, and he isn't Jewish.  He just doesn't like his hot dogs to have &quot;lips and assholes&quot; as he puts it, lol.  I have always loved pork, and I'm sitting at my desk eating shrimp right now.  <br>
<br>
I don't really like the idea of hunting for sport either.  Hunted meat isn't considered non-kosher for purposes of animal rights, but instead for spiritual reasons since Jews aren't supposed to take any joy in the killing of another living being.  There are all kinds of strict dietary rules involved in Judaism, but I've always seen it as taking it to the extreme when it comes to spirituality.  I don't mean extreme that I think it is wrong or bad, but just that I have never been interested in taking time out of my day to analyze the spiritual process behind everything I eat.  I think the whole idea of not wanting to mix a mother's milk with the meat of her baby is a beautiful one, but I still like to eat tacos, lol.  I'm a heathen.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I went back and looked it up in Fast Food Nation - I had some of my facts confused in my previous post. What they do in most large slaughterhouses is knock the cows out cold with pneumatic &quot;knocker&quot; then string them upside down and slit their throats. They are usually unconcious but not always. They die pretty quickly but I wouldn't quite call it humane. Line speeds for slaughter &amp; processing run at about 400 cows per hour these days, an insane speed that makes the job incredibly dangerous.<br>

“This was, doubtless, the original purpose at the time when this code of slaughter was conceived, and its standards probably produced the most humane and hygienic form of killing then available. But today, to kill the animals this way produces something far removed from the original intent of these laws. Orthodox Jewish and Moslem dietary laws forbid consumption of meat from animals which are not &quot;healthy and moving&quot; when killed. Religious orthodoxy today interprets this to mean that kosher meat must come from animals who have not been stunned before being killed. They must be fully conscious when it's done. Further, in order to qualify for the kosher stamp of approval, the animal must have its throat slit in a particular way. The consequences of this interpretation of kosher slaughtering are a travesty for the poor creatures involved.<br>
You see, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 requires, for sanitary reasons, that no slaughtered animal may fall in the blood of a previously slaughtered animal. What this means, in practice, is that animals must be killed while suspended from a conveyer belt, rather than while lying on the floor. <br>
Stringing up an animal before delivering the final blow doesn't cause it any pain if it has already been rendered unconscious. But when an animal must be conscious when killed, as kosher regulations stipulate, and also must have its throat cut in the particular way kosher law requires, the animal is forced to undergo an enormous amount of extra pain:”<br>
This is the part I found interesting too and I think it was quoted in an Am Atheist newsletter which is where I copied it from:<br>
“You may think that today, because relatively few people &quot;eat kosher,&quot; only a very small percentage of animals would be &quot;killed kosher&quot;. You may also think that even including the non-religious people who seek out kosher meat, mistakenly believing it to be better, this still wouldn't amount to a significant percentage. And finally you are probably quite sure that if you buy meat that isn't labeled kosher, you are certainly not consuming meat from animals killed in this fashion.<br>
But, I'm sorry to say, you'd be wrong on each account. You see, for meat to be passed as kosher by Orthodox Rabbis, it is not enough for the animal merely to have been conscious when killed and to have its throat slit in the required way. A kosher Jew is also forbidden to consume the blood of an animal, so the veins and arteries must be cut out of kosher meat. In many parts of a cow, however, removing the blood vessels is very costly, and so the meat packers have resolved this difficulty by removing the blood vessels only from those parts of the animal from which they can be cut out inexpensively. Thus, even though the whole animal was killed kosher, only these parts are then sold as kosher meat. In other words, there's a lot of meat left over. This means that a great deal of the meat in our supermarkets and restaurants, while not labeled kosher, is in fact from animals hoisted and slaughtered according to kosher regulations. One authority states:<br>
&quot;It has been estimated that over 90% of the animals slaughtered in New Jersey - whose slaughterhouses supply New York City as well as their own state - are slaughtered by the ritual method. &quot;<br>
Another report states:<br>
&quot;Although less than 5% of the flesh in the United States is bought kosher, as much as 500% of the animals are slaughtered as such. &quot;<br>
<br>
Like I said, I'm guilty of eating kosher because of the lips and assholes thing, but it seems that may not matter (so much of the meat is killed in this method), course it doesn't fit in my WW diet anymore, but that's beside the point. Has anyone read this book or know more about it? I hate to sound callous, but even if it is terrible and tortuous to the cows, it still isn't as bad as if it were humans being treated as such. <br>

It was written by Jon Robbins, heir to the Baskin-Robbins dairy family. He is now the black sheep of that family of course, for standing against animal cruelty in factory farming. He was certainly in a position to know what he was talking about re: modern animal farming.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Diet for a New America</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is fascinating and was well ahead of its time. It was written in the late 70's or early 80's I think, yet much of the health research it is based on only came to light in the mainstream press in the last few years. One good example is that he said the popular &quot;target&quot; cholesterol level of 200 was way too high, and it should actually be around 120. Gee, guess what was in the paper just this week... 200 is too high after all. Robbins really did his homework when he wrote that book.<br>
<br>
This is from Amazon.com: <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Robbins, who is medical director of the California Institute for Health and Healing, details how livestock is raised under increasingly industrialized conditions by &quot;agribusiness oligopolies.&quot; Grazing and foraging have given way to debeaking, tail-docking, dehorning and castration, and treatment with pesticides, hormones, growth and appetite stimulants, tranquilizers and antibiotics which, in turn, are assimilated by humans. The author correlates our &quot;protein obsessed&quot; society with a higher incidence of arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, cancer and other degenerative diseases, as well as freakish occurrences like premature puberty from estrogen contamination. As Robbins debunks nutritional myths perpetuated by the powerful meat and dairy industries (indicting as well his family's Baskin-Robbins ice-cream empire), this is sure to prove controversial.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, he talks about how 100 years ago, the onset of  menstruation was about age 16. It's now closer to 10, in part because of better nutrition and in part because of growth hormone overload. In some places in South America where the hormone use is completely unregulated, they've got 3-year-olds with breasts and pubic hair. <br>

But personally I enjoy the taste of venison. It is also better for you usually because it is a naturally leaner meat. I have gone hunting and I have killed a deer before. I haven't gone since that time because I found it to be very upsetting to actually kill a deer and thankfully I can get venison from my Dad when I'm home. One day I might take it back up to supply my own family with venison because I really love the meat. But not until my children are much older. <br>
<br>
But those in my family that hunt, the enjoyment of the hunting has very little to do with the actual shooting of the animal. Mainly its getting outside in nature. Dad loves it and often watches deer rather then shoots them. He never uses all his tags.Though in years when the deer population is very high he will kill more. There is a conservation aspect of hunting and he is very into that part of it. His hunting club is pretty responsible in that area as well which is one of the reasons he belongs to that particular club. Along with my little sister and several other family members. In a way, for him the act of hunting is almost religious. Not the killing, but rather getting out in nature and just enjoying the world, and the fruits of the land. Dad also tends to get annoyed at those who don't use what they shoot. It upsets him and he says ugly words about those type of people.<br>
<br>
I know a child my dd's age who has early puberty. She is three and is growing breasts. It is very upsetting for her mother though the girl has no clue. They have her on some type of shot to delay it and she will have to stay on the shot until she is 10. Once a month, its sad really. <br>

I don't know if you have kids, but if you do, next time one of them brings home a neat little coloring page extolling the virtues of milk, cheese and ice cream, take a look along the edges and see who printed it and donated it to the school. I guarantee you it's the American Dairy Association or American Dairy Council (or whatever they are calling themselves these days). We were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>all</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> subjected to this stuff in school. Even knowing as much as I do, I still equate milk with health somewhere in the back of my mind - but at least I realize it's just residual brainwashing, not fact. Anyway, it's not about health, it's about agribusiness.<br>
<br>
Does it do a body good? Calcium is good, the problem is, Dairy is so high in protein that for your body to process it, it ends up correcting the resulting rise in akaline level in your blood by taking calcium OUT of your bones. So you net a calcium LOSS. Study after study has proven this (um, but not the studies funded by the Dairy Council) You are much better off eating a little less protein and getting your calcium from healthier sources such as spinach. This is why African Bantu women, who nurse their babies for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>years</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and eat NO dairy and far less protein than what's in Western diets have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>no</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> osteoporosis, whereas those of us pounding protein-based calcium our whole lives are plagued with it.<br>
<br>
Think of it this way, we are the ONLY mammal that makes the milk of another animal a major part of our diet. Milk that is really intended for a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>calf</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Pretty weird. The best cartoon I ever saw on the subject showed a boy and a man on their knees sucking at a cows teat. Seems bizarre, but isn't that the reality of it?<br>
<br>
I use soy milk on my cereal. My 22 month old has never had cows milk, he gets ALL of his milk from me. Some people are aghast at the notion of nursing a toddler, the same people think cow's milk is wholly appropriate for a child his age. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So I ask them, &quot;when did he stop being a baby human and turn into a baby cow?&quot; My 6-year-old daughter was a huge cow's milk drinker and though she's cut back recently, she still won't touch soy or rice milk. <br>
<br>
