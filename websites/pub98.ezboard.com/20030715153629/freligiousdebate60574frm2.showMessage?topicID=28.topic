I remember thinking that it was a fabulous idea because I felt as a member of a religious minority I needed the protection of the first amendment. <br>
<br>
I would like to hear others' opinions on this subject.  I would like to hear from the religious board members especially.  Do you think we should have separation of church and state?  Do you believe that this is a Christian nation?<br>
<br>
I honestly have never understood why people believe that church and state can or should mix.  Educate me.  <br>

I believe that a religious organization should not control the government or government offices. I believe that people should have the right to worship or not worship as they choose. However, it becomes a sticky issue when members of each side of the debate become so &quot;me&quot; oriented. I think that we all spend time trying to see where our rights are being stomped on and we forget that others have rights too. <br>
<br>
That said, I will elaborate. The Pledge issue was the most recent debate I saw... this is a hard one because although I agree that those who don't believe in God shouldn't have to say &quot;under God&quot;, I don't think that those who do believe in God shouldn't be permitted to. <br>
<br>
It gets so sketchy because if you have religious types in a public meeting who want to pray, those who oppose prayer in public meetings are mad. Yet, should those who want to pray not be allowed to because it makes someone else uncomfortable or feel excluded? I think you have to be careful that in ensuring one side isn't excluded that you take away the right to religion for the other side. <br>
<br>
Also, most people can't separate their religion from the rest of themselves. As a believer in God, I can't walk into a public meeting, government building, or school and leave my religion at the door. It affects the choices I make, it affects what I believe to be best, and it affects my attitudes. Although I think the separation is a good thing, I think it is difficult to do without stripping one side or the other of their rights. <br>
<br>
Personally, I would have no problem with a teacher who is athiest telling my child that they don't believe in God, a Jewish teacher telling my child that they don't believe in Christ, or even a homosexual teacher telling my child that they have a partner of the same gender. I don't understant why those who don't believe in God don't want their child told that the teacher does believe in God. We, as parents, are responsible for teaching our children and I personally have confidence in what I teach my child. I don't think that a teacher telling my child that he/she doesn't believe in God would change her belief system. I don't think, however, that any religion should run things in government or that a school should teach that the doctrines of one religion, etc are truth. Giving information about other belief systems only makes us wiser, more well-rounded and better off, imo.<br>
<br>
Sorry that this is extremely choppy and rambled. Just typing off the top of my head and for some reason, I have trouble articulating my thoughts on this subject.<br>

The point is why does it matter what you believe in? I don't go around with a flag waving saying I am an atheist. Why do religious people feel the need too? Would you want to have your child constantly preached to the value Hinduism or Catholicism? The thing is the people who feel the need to let everybody know their religious status are usually the ones who feel the need to press their ideas onto someone else.<br>

That the exact reason why I support SOCAS. Because then who gets to decide what religion is best? I don't want decisions about country made because how someone feels about god or because the bible says its so. <br>
<br>
I realize that is kinda what you are saying.<br>

Yep, well if you read the court ruling, the judges agree with you. If a kid is reciting the pledge of the allegience, he's perfectly able to say &quot;under god&quot; if he wants. What an individual says is not what was under scrutiny. The problem is a teacher or other authority figure (principal, etc) leading the students in a pledge that includes the phrase &quot;under god&quot;. It does NOT mean that kids reciting the pledge can't add in &quot;under god&quot; on their own. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yet, should those who want to pray not be allowed to because it makes someone else uncomfortable or feel excluded<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, not true. Public officials are completely within their rights to pray before a meeting if they so choose. What is NOT legal is for a led prayer to be offered before the meeting. <br>
See the difference?<br>

And that's the beauty of the First Amendment. It doesn't ASK anyone to leave their beliefs at the door--not judges, not statesmen, not even the president of the US. They just can't violate the establishment clause.<br>

The thing is the people who feel the need to let everybody know their religious status are usually the ones who feel the need to press their ideas onto someone else&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I totally agree and maybe didn't articulate that very well... I would actually like my children to be taught about other belief systems. I don't subscribe to the &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; theory. I would way rather my child receive information about other religions. I never said that they should be teaching whether or not it was true or given any opinions on the matter. But I think that any information that is subjective should not be presented with a teachers pov as the reference. I had a psychology teacher in college who gave her opinion on every single theory. For instance, Freud. She thought he was a quack. Anyone in that introductory class left it believing that Freud was just that. I happen to think that Freud had some very valid theories but that people take them out of the context he presented them. Facts are one thing, trying to sway opinions is a totally different story. I never said that I supported teaching religion in school, only teaching about different belief systems.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;That the exact reason why I support SOCAS. Because then who gets to decide what religion is best? I don't want decisions about country made because how someone feels about god or because the bible says its so. &lt;&lt; <br>
<br>
The only way to avoid that happening is to elect officials who feel the way you do or to petition the elected officials and hope they listen. Unfortunately, if you have officials in government who believe that abortion is wrong because of the bible or otherwise, they will fight for that stance. How can you separate church and state when the officials belief systems are going to dictate how the stand on key issues? <br>
<br>
I feel exactly the same about legislation. In the last presidential election, I did not vote for Bush. I agree with him on many of the *moral* issues but agreed with Gore on more of the social/financial issues. I happen to believe that you cannot legislate morality. You can make things illegal but that won't stop people from doing them. Abortion is one of those issues. Although I oppose it, I don't see how making it illegal will stop people from doing it. They will just do it illegally. People have to make their own choices on moral issues. But on the same note, I think we would be hard pressed to find a politician or political leader who would take what his constituents say and vote based on that if it stood in the face of his religious beliefs. So although SOCAS would work in a perfect world, it has shortfalls when trying to institute it in the world we live in. Just as other laws are only as good as people observances of such laws, SOCAS is one that unless people grab hold of and believe strongly in (as I know Emmy does <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) they just aren't as effective as they should be. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Yep, well if you read the court ruling, the judges agree with you. If a kid is reciting the pledge of the allegience, he's perfectly able to say &quot;under god&quot; if he wants. What an individual says is not what was under scrutiny. The problem is a teacher or other authority figure (principal, etc) leading the students in a pledge that includes the phrase &quot;under god&quot;. It does NOT mean that kids reciting the pledge can't add in &quot;under god&quot; on their own. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Does that mean that the teacher or principal is then not allowed to say the words? If she/he does, would it be considered leading the children? Where is the line drawn? <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Teaching about a belief system is one thing, teaching a belief system as fact or truth is an entirely different matter, and too fine of a line for many teachers to be able to see clearly, IMO.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
And that was EXACTLY what I was trying to say in regards to teaching *about* belief systems. However, where do you draw the line on what can be taught and what can't? My World History Class taught a lot about the ancient Catholic Church. Here in Utah, the Utah History classes, if you take out the Mormons, there would be relatively no Utah History. You would have to take Darwin out of the Science books, and anything which could be debated out of any other class. The softer sciences of psychology, sociology, etc, could all be eliminated because they are prone to interpretation and the opinion of the person teaching them. I agree that there should not be teachers passing on their beliefs for or against any belief system or group of people. To do so, imo, is discriminatory. But where do you stop the slippery slope? I would really like to know. Because this is one of those instances where you look at it from one side and it looks totally different than it does from the other side. <br>
<br>
Although I agree that it is wrong for a teacher, leader, etc to lead prayers, discussions, pledges that might exclude someone, I also see that it limits the rights of those who are leading. Maybe I am off base here. Can a teacher in a classroom actually say &quot;under God&quot; during the pledge if she doesn't try to get the other kids to do so? Or is she to not say those words because it might be perceived as leading them? <br>
<br>
I can place myself on the other side of the coin and see how it would feel. There are many &quot;energetic&quot; religious types, especially some Christian groups, who won't leave others well enough alone and who are constantly pushing their views, trying to force others to conform to their way of thinking and that would get extremely old. Also, I can see where, for the most part, especially where I am from (UT) that there would not be very many voices which advocate a stance other than mainstream (although that is changing). However, on the flip side, can you see why Christians, who love their God, believe in Him and do worship Him would be frustrated at the least and somewhat passionate about what seems like an effort to remove Him? Although I understand why you say &quot;He&quot; should have never been part of it in the first place... I still find it hard to remove God from schools, courts, govt. buildings and meetings without removing those who believe in Him. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, we don't live in a world where tolerance is what is popular. I personally don't understand that. I believe that every person should have a right to believe what they choose. I am happy to share my beliefs if someone wants to know about them. I welcome that opportunity but I do not see the point in pushing my beliefs on others. They have a right to believe whatever and however they want to. And I believe that is a God-given right, or one that should be inherent to all of us simply because no person or person's beliefs should be placed above another. <br>
<br>
Anyway, again, this is one subject I don't articulate very well on but I am trying. So bring on the rebuts!<br>

It just seems weird to me that a child in this country would be legally bound to attend school where he would then be exposed against his and his parents wishes to a leader implying &quot;under God&quot; if that is not what they believe.  It makes me sad for how uncomfortable those children would be.  I don't think God wants that.<br>

The short answer:<br>
<br>
When teachers and administrators are not acting in their official capacities, such as in the teachers' lounge when they are &quot;off-duty,&quot; they may express their religious views and pray in a non-disruptive manner. However, teachers and administrators may not encourage or discourage students' religious activity, nor may they participate in such activity while acting in their official capacities. <br>

I do think we need more on the against side, to reach a more moderate lvl in day to day life. <br>
<br>
I've seen places where religious symbols are banned from school. I think that is wrong. A student, and yes even a teacher, should feel free to wear a religious symbol if they so wish, including but not limited to - cross, star of david, whatever a wiccan symbol would be etc etc. Yet I'm torn on some things because they could be destructive to classroom discipline. Such as the head cloth of Muslims, or the full body covering of some disciplines of Muslims. Part of me thinks they should be free to wear it, but I think it would be highly disruptive to other students in the classroom. <br>
<br>
So this is a hard and trickly place. Where do your rights begin and my rights end? A friend put it &quot;your right to hit me, ends at my nose&quot; I can kinda see that, but its hard.<br>

&quot;Let Us Pray<br>
by Garrett Epps<br>
December 18, 2002 <br>
<br>
Soon, very soon as these things go, the deliberations of the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors will open with an invocation to the ancient gods of the Wiccan religion.<br>
 <br>
    <br>
I wouldn’t mind bowing my head respectfully while a Wiccan priestess calls the four directions and invokes the blessings of the ancient Celtic gods on the Board’s deliberations — if that is the word. Some of the most devoutly religious people I know follow the Goddess; and, for all I know, they may even be right.<br>
<br>
But many conservative Christians will be scandalized. For them, the Wiccan blessing is sacrilege at best and demonolatry at worst, a profound affront to their beliefs and even a danger to their mortal souls. And when the Wiccans get their chance — as they will, as surely as Solstice follows Samhain — to bless the Chesterfield County Board, these Christians will feel disoriented and affronted. They will feel, in other words, the way non-Christians have felt for years when politicians claim the endorsement of the Lord of Hosts.<br>
<br>
If history is a guide, their leaders will tell them that “the courts” or “judicial activists” are at fault, for robbing “the people” of Chesterfield of their “Christian heritage.” That will be a lie, told for political advantage — a conscious attempt to exploit religious fears for secular power. For when the Wiccans get their turn, it will be the result of decades of effort by the religious right to blur the boundary between church and state.<br>
<br>
The day of Wiccan prayer will be the day that Reagan and Bush have made. Rejoice and be glad in it.<br>
<br>
For nearly half a century, conservatives have been trying to get around the First Amendment, which forbids government from creating an “establishment of religion.” What that means is that in America there can be no official, government-sponsored faith. Every American is free to believe and practice those beliefs; government must treat us all as equals.<br>
<br>
Beginning in 1962, the Supreme Court tried to give effect to that principle by barring government from sponsoring most religious exercises. Schools could not require Bible-reading or prayer, for example. That principle extended to high school graduations, and to prayer before football games as well.<br>
<br>
Of all people, the devout should have been the first to hail this principle. It meant that they and their children would be safe from the shifting winds of public sentiment. During the 1970s, for example, overenthusiastic school districts in some places tried to require courses in Transcendental Meditation, complete with Sanskrit invocations of the Hindu pantheon. Christian parents screamed, and the courts wisely said that the Establishment Clause applied to everyone — “traditional” American religions and groovy new ones as well. Religion in America is a matter of private choice; government should not be involved.<br>
<br>
Evangelical Christians for nearly a century had been strong supporters of separation between church and state. But in the 1970s a new breed of preacher — political animals like Virginia’s own Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson — proclaimed a new revelation. America would not survive unless government made sure that people worshiped God. Private choice would not do the job; like lost sheep, the ordinary American needed government to point the way to Heaven. The alternative — leaving children and adults to follow their own consciences — was too horrible to contemplate.<br>
<br>
The preachers demanded “equality” for religion in the public sphere. If the Campfire Boys and Girls used public school buildings, it was discrimination to forbid the Good News Club from holding Bible study there. If student fees paid for the Chess Club, then it was discrimination to keep evangelical groups from spending the same mandatory fees to bring students to Christ. And, for that matter, if the United Way got government funds to help the poor, then it was unfair to exclude gospel missions from the public largess as well.<br>
<br>
This claim for “equality” gave birth to the push for “faith-based” social services. Religious bodies should be given the chance to handle government money, feeding the hungry and preaching abstinence to teenage girls. If a little bit of the Word of God slipped out at taxpayers’ expense, that was OK, too. James Madison would have disagreed — the Father of the First Amendment believed that “the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever.” But what did he know? No less an authority than Clarence Thomas dismissed Madison’s views as “extreme,” and thus irrelevant to the new world of “faith-based” government.<br>
<br>
But if it is discrimination to keep the Good News Club out of schools, it is discrimination to keep Louis Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam from government-funded prison ministries, or Islamic madrassahs from receiving government school vouchers. And if the supervisors, in their wisdom, offer local clergy the opportunity to pray over their fellow citizens at government sessions, then everyone must be included. My guess is that the supervisors and their lawyers know this, and they know they will lose when the Wiccan case gets to court. But there are political points to be gained by calling (as board chairwoman Kelly Miller recently did) Wicca “a nonreligion” because “it doesn’t recognize the God that we have recognized.”<br>
<br>
Miller and the board will waste the public’s money by asking a hapless federal judge to bless their official bigotry. The poor jurist will refuse; what choice will he or she have? Then Miller and the board will denounce him as an “activist” and a “liberal” — even though liberal judges in these parts are about as scarce as Chaminade basketball fans.<br>
<br>
The decision will be a triumph of activism, true — but not of judges nor of liberals. Decades of patient work by aggressive Christian politicians and conservative theorists will bear fruit when we hear the corners called before the supervisors’ meeting.<br>
<br>
Conservatives who don’t like it have only themselves to blame. As you never tire of telling the rest of us, it’s your country; the rest of us just live here.<br>
<br>
Blessed be. S<br>

<br>
This was particularly disturbing to read-&quot;Here in Utah, the Utah History classes, if you take out the Mormons, there would be relatively no Utah History.&quot;<br>
Why is it so difficult for you to distinguish between teaching about history and the role religion and religious figures played and preaching or praying in class? BTW--how is the Mountain Meadows Massacre handled in Utah out of curiosity since it was the greatest act of terrorism American on other Americans in which all men, women and children were slaughtered over the age of 8 for no reason?<br>
<br>
&quot;You would have to take Darwin out of the Science books, and anything which could be debated out of any other class.&quot;<br>
What!?! Why? Do you honestly think Darwin is in all the science books? Did you not make it to Physics class in high school? What about chemistry--you can't convert an equation without Darwin? Honestly--these kind of throwing the baby out with the bathwater scare tactics are what make people think if teachers don't lead prayers in home room in the morning we'll have to cancel algebra class...talk about fuzzy logic!<br>
<br>
&quot;The softer sciences of psychology, sociology, etc, could all be eliminated because they are prone to interpretation and the opinion of the person teaching them.&quot;<br>
Wrong-my HS psychology teacher barely had an pulse, much less an opinion and these are all sciences with must stand up to rigorous testing and analysis. Also--all science is up for debate since those of us who rely on it don't claim to have omniscience. We will learn and grow more over time and school should be all about skepticism, inquiry and debate--not blind faith, that's what church is for.<br>
<br>
&quot;But where do you stop the slippery slope?&quot;<br>
At advocating for or preaching religion in public places.<br>
<br>
As the case with the Wiccan clearly illustrates, it's the xians who are most uncomfortable following the 1st amendment to the constitution and who want their god (and their god only) to be prayed to in meetings, classrooms etc. We have already seen what happens when Islamic practices are discussed in schools in Ca. and xians would simply not tolerate everyone bending over on a prayer rug ro drawing down the moon at the start of the day. Here's the crux of it---&quot;I still find it hard to remove God from schools, courts, govt. buildings and meetings without removing those who believe in Him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really?? Wiccans and earth religion pagans are able to public business and go to schools where their gods/goddesses are not only removed, but were never included. Have we &quot;remov[ed] those who beleive in [them]??&quot; <br>
<br>
Here we go again with xians not wanting to be treated themselves as they have been treating others for thousands of years. How NOT surprising. <br>

I don't believe that anyone doubts that.  I think the problem arises when the idea of SOCAS is ignored.  (Forgive me for sounding like a naive optimist.)  I always felt that SOCAS and the entire Bill of Rights was designed to protect individuals from the tyranny of the majority in a democracy.  For example, I don't particularly like the idea of the Faith-Baseed Iniative--it is as if I am being forced to &quot;tithe&quot; to religious institutions.  Why should the government force me to &quot;tithe&quot; to religious institutions?<br>
<br>
I just think that both government and church would be improved if they stayed out of each others business.  <br>
<br>
Regarding the Pledge:  As an untenured teacher, I feel tacitly commanded to say the pledge in its entirety in front of my class.  I feel that I am being forced to say something that I don't believe in.  I would much rather say &quot;one nation under law&quot; instead.

<br>
If you would re-read what I actually said, you would see that I specifically said that I am happy with teaching ABOUT (meaning facts) religions, not interjecting opinions about what is right, wrong and true. I specifically said that this should be done in the home. I never did or never would advocate preaching any religion in a public forum. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;BTW--how is the Mountain Meadows Massacre handled in Utah out of curiosity since it was the greatest act of terrorism American on other Americans in which all men, women and children were slaughtered over the age of 8 for no reason?&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
From what I remember of my Utah History class, The Mountain Meadows Massacre was described as a controversial event in which a group of Mormons, led by John D. Lee, and a group of Puite Indians attacked a wagon train of immigrants coming from Arkansas on their way to California. There were about 120 people killed. The federal govt came to investigate but other members of the church refused to turn Lee over. Later Brigham Young ex-communicated Lee and exiled him from the rest of the Mormons in Utah. Although this is what is suspected to have happened, they may never know exactly what occurred.  That is what I remember from school.<br>
<br>
Certainly the Mountain Meadow's Massacre is a dark day in LDS history. I don't think you will find anyone who is proud of that.... but we could run an entire thread on theories as to why that occurred....<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Do you honestly think Darwin is in all the science books? &lt;&lt; Did I ever say ALL? I don't think so. You could only remove Darwin from the books he is actually in. Of course I made it through Physics, Chemistry, Physiology, Anatomy, need I go on? I loved science and debated about minoring in Physics.... in college... I am not as unintelligent as you seem to be implying.....<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;these kind of throwing the baby out with the bathwater scare tactics are what make people think if teachers don't lead prayers in home room in the morning we'll have to cancel algebra class...talk about fuzzy logic!&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I am not throwing the baby out with the bath water... however, a/as don't trust Christian teachers to teach FACTS about religion yet I am supposed to trust that only FACTS will be presented about evolution and ape descension????  Why is it that someone who believes in the latter would be more trustworthy? Why is that? I never mentioned Algebra... Algebra is not subjective to opinion unless you consider liking or disliking it brainwashing our children.... I don't see anyone debating &quot;There is no algebra... Algebra isn't correct...&quot; There is a huge difference between Algebra, Physics, and Chemistry and Religion, Evolution, and Theory.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;these are all sciences with must stand up to rigorous testing and analysis.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Have you ever actually looked into the testing and analysis of the softer sciences? For every study that &quot;proves&quot; one thing, there is another that proves exactly the opposite. We are talking about human and social behavior. How can you &quot;prove&quot; any of that?  All you can do is predict what would happen most of the time. There absolutely NO absolutes in these sciences. There is only theory with countless numbers of studies to back up every side of the theory. Besides, they have &quot;proved&quot; that number of suicides correlates with the price of bananas... want me to find the actual study&quot;? I will.  When truthfully, it is probably because when the price of bananas go up, it is really an indication of the greater economy and it's troubles which is more likely the reason for the higher incidence of suicides. However, the researchers were able to show that the price of bananas correlates with the suicides. See in social sciences, you don't ever &quot;prove&quot; anything. You can only illustrate a correlation.<br>
 <br>
&gt;&gt;school should be all about skepticism, inquiry and debate&lt;&lt;  <br>
<br>
yes, that is what it should be about but most elementary, secondary, and post secondary schools are more concerned with moving students through, teaching the basic curriculum of reading, writing, math, english, science, etc. They do not, at least in my experience, spend much time worrying about even teaching students how to debate. Skeptisism is punishable, and there is not time for real inquiry. So, while school should be about those things, it is not. And maybe it is because I am Christian that I don't remember being preached to, unless it was my Seminary class that was before school that I used as an excuse to go out to breakfast.<br>
<br>
The thing that bothers me most about the tone of your post is that you are grouping me in with other Christians like Mom Loves Um who spend their entire life &quot;witnessing&quot; to people who don't want to hear it. I have never been one to go with the flow. I have questioned and gone against everything I was taught as a child by my parents and eventually made the decision to come back. I angered my AP English teacher in high school because we had to read a book in which there were many Christian symbols which he wanted us to pick out. It was &quot;The Old Man in the Sea&quot;. I was angry because I saw things differently than he did but unless I saw them as he did (and he was a Mormon bishop), he said I was wrong. I confronted him in front of the entire class. I asked why he was the expert. Why he thought that his analysis of the book was better than mine. I asked why if we were going to study great authors, why didn't we study Dr. Seuss, who was less likely to disclude anyone. He swore at me and asked me to leave. It is the mentality of him and people like him who believe that they are right and to Hell with anyone else that gives all Christians a bad name. I do not feel that way. I do not advocate teaching or preaching religion.  But for some reason you seem to think that I have said that we should be leading children in prayer and preaching God to them and indoctrinating them in schools and public places when I have clearly said the opposite. <br>
<br>
All I was trying to say is that when you have people who believe in something, you can not have a society completely absent of that object of belief. Whether it be God, Buddah, Allah, The Great Ape, I don't care. I agree that no person of authority should be leading children to much of anything. They are to present facts. Plain and simple... no matter what the subject. That is the only way to allow students/children to be able to objectively make their own decisions about the material presented. <br>
<br>
Why can't you see that I am not saying what you are accusing me of? Is it so incomprehesible that a Christian (which to most Christians is not accepted as Christian) would not want Christianity or anything else preached in the classroom?<br>

<br>
No I was not.  I don't think we were created, I don't think it was done equally and I think the rights we enjoy were hard won, not just given.  <br>
<br>
I have worked in too many ARC centers and tutored too many handicapped kids to think we all got dealt an even hand.  I know too many kids who were more privileged than I to think my hand is that superior.  I read too many 'baby dies locked in car' stories to think there is some fairness to it all.  I watch our president Dubyah wipe his ...feet... on our constitution to often to think these rights are inalienable.  All it takes is an act of congress.  We get the cards we are dealt, we make the best hand we can of them.  No gods, no plan, just old fashioned luck.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You could only remove Darwin from the books he is actually in. &quot;<br>
<br>
Why would you remove Darwin from the science books that he is in?  He does not endorse a religion, he does not refute one.  He identified a factual set of patterns, and provided the best answer to those patterns then submitted it to the scrutiny of the larger scientific community who hammered it from all sides, revising and refining as they did.  Evolution is one of the single strongest and most evidence supported principles in science.  Are you asking that we ignore the facts and set them aside in the name of your religion?  Is that preferable to teaching the science of biology in a biology class from which all our medical advancements spring?  This <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the baby with the bathwater here if you are.  <br>
<br>
The government has a constitutional obligation not to endorse one religion over another.  It does not have an obligation to revise history or edit truth to protect the tenets of a religion from scrutiny.  This would be the same as the Raelians asking astronomy teachers not to discuss what is really in the tail of a comet; or Nazi’s to get the holocaust revised in the history books to say they didn’t kill Jews.  Evolution is in the science books because it is a valid, tested and thoroughly established scientific force, not some subversive plot to undermine xianity.  You want to raise your child in ignorance of science, do so, but don’t expect the government to have to help you, majority or not.<br>
<br>
The fact that evolution happens is not under debate in the realm of science.  Look at any major publication or scientific journal.  You don’t see articles or studies submitted for peer review suggesting a replacement to evolution.  You see many discussing the specific mechanics of HOW it operates, but not the fact that it IS operating.  That is because, unless or until a better solution is presented, the matter is settled.  The same way our heliocentric solar system and the molecular weight of water is settled.  Produce a fact not explained by the theory and a solution that explains all the other facts and the exception better and you’ll get a Nobel Prize.<br>
<br>
You imply there is some debate over the ‘theory of evolution’ yet it is as valid as the ‘theory of uniform gravitation’ or the ‘theory of quantum relativity.’  This is not some trumped up opinion no matter how much people try to obfuscate it.  <br>
<br>
Fact: organism reproduction produces differences in offspring.  <br>
Fact: differences that create a competitive advantage increase the chances of survival and reproduction.<br>
Fact: reproduction of differences accumulate over time.<br>
Fact: after enough time, the differences are enough that the original organisms cannot breed.<br>
<br>
That’s evolution in a nutshell (change over time.)  Humans and apes share a common ancestor.  We are not siblings.  No ape will give birth to a person, no person will give birth to an ape.   The ancestor we share also shares ancestors further back with polar bears and tigers.  Further back still they share them with dinosaurs and even fish.  You can demonstrate evolution by selective breeding in the lab using insects, reptiles, amphibians and mammals.  There are no roving bands of wild miniature poodles because they were bred selectively by HUMANS.  Evolution is change over time, forces for it are any selection process, be they natural or man-made.  Try and force that out of the school system and eliminate the purpose of having one.<br>

i too am a big proponent of natural selection and anyone who has gotten more than one cold should know something out there is evolving right before their &quot;eyes&quot;<br>
<br>
i, on the other hand, think that the HUMANS you are referring to are baby gods.<br>
<br>
and the luck you are referring to has to do with pre-existent choices. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mamagadfly>MamaGadfly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/3/03 7:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Don't think it was misunderstaning, but maybe u can explain</span><hr size=1> Snowygirl—Sorry if you feel you are misunderstood so allow me to include YOUR WORDS on the subject to see what was actually said.<br>
<br>
“…Here in Utah, the Utah History classes, if you take out the Mormons, there would be relatively no Utah History.”<br>
But why would you take the Mormons out of Utah history if you do not object to teaching ABOUT religion? This is what I mean by wildly jumping from not praying in front of the classroom to removing entire sections of history that mention religion. No atheist or SOCAS advocate has ever said anything like this, but by bringing it up, you imply it is the next step.<br>
<br>
“You would have to take Darwin out of the Science books,” <br>
Why, as DBC said, he does not advocate any religion. It is a theory backed up with scientific evidence.<br>
“…and anything which could be debated out of any other class.”<br>
Again—throwing out the baby with the bathwater. If we can’t pray to god in class then we have to remove “anything which could be debated…”!! Where does this come from? This is the kind of statement to which I was referring. You were very clear too.<br>
<br>
“Because this is one of those instances where you look at it from one side and it looks totally different than it does from the other side.”<br>
This is where you are wrong. No matter which side you look at a prayer from and no matter to what god students are being forced to pray or pledge, it’s a violation of the SOCAS. You may say there shouldn’t be such a separation or that religion or god belongs in government, but then your beef is not with me, it’s with the constitution and the law. There are several countries like England and Iran where this separation does not exist. <br>
<br>
You never addressed why you feel not praying to or putting up plaques to your specific god in government buildings is removing you when other religions still participate without their prayers and icons being there. <br>
<br>
“Anyway, again, this is one subject I don't articulate very well on but I am trying. So bring on the rebuts!”<br>
Perhaps by your own description you are not skilled in articulating why you feel we have to remove all debate and soft sciences from schools if we follow the 1st amendment and don’t promote a particular religion, but then it was not your post I misunderstood but your intentions which must have been poorly communicated. Only you can speak to that…but then you also added you wanted us to “bring on the rebuts!”. I dare say you were not misunderstood here, just disagreed with.<br>

<br>
This what all the fuss is about.  To me it is all the same.  We are not asking for a pledge that says &quot;One nation, without god&quot; we are asking that your religion be left at the door, with your umbrella and muddy shoes.  We don't want our hard earned dollars taxed by the government and handed over to faiths we didn't choose, we'd rather hand it directly ourselves and save the expense of a civil servant to do the accounting.  Freedom to choose, kind of like voting, only effective.<br>

You have the same rights as the children in that classroom.  <br>
<br>
I even taught deaf children and it was very obvious when I obstained from those words. I wouldn't sign them either.<br>
<br>
I got into it with another teacher and even my principal; of course I won.  You don't have to say the words, and it is within your rights to make sure that the children know they don't have to say the pledge as a whole, and they have the choice to leave out the words. ((Got into it with a few teachers over a few of my students not saying the pledge as well. I had 2 JWs and a Pagan.))<br>
<br>
Hope that helped you.  Just say the Pledge as it was written before the Knights of Columbus and McCarthy got a hold of it.<br>
<br>
**I pledge allegience to the Flag, of the United States of America, and to the Republic for Which it stands, one Nation, indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.**<br>
