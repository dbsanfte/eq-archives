While I feel like a consensus of some kind was reached over the issue of exposure to church being necessary for religious education, some other things weren't quite resolved, such as the whole question of whether or not UU is or ought to be a recognised, organised religion and the implications surrounding atheists who choose to be UU.  So, that said:<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ut it seems just saying something seems incongruous here causes a weird and undue amount of defensiveness and offense taken.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think the word &quot;incongruous&quot; can be taken two ways.  If you're saying that an atheist attending a UU service is somehow inappropriate or contradictory, then that is offensive, and that is how I've been reading your responses.  Thus far, your tone has suggested that UUs are at best wishy-wishy, and at worst, completely lacking the cajones to break from traditional religious culture and adopting a pseudo-Christian lifestyle in an effort to &quot;fit in&quot;.  Either way, not too flattering and a gross misconception.<br>
Perhaps you mean to say that the UUA is incompatible with your notion of what a spiritual community ought to be, that it defies your assumptions of all organised religions, in which case we have the right to try and clarify the issue without being branded &quot;defensive&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;If UU's really don't have a set belief system or want to be known as a religion then how did they get offically recognized as such?&quot;<br>
<br>
While the UUA emerged in the 1960's, Unitarianism and Universalism go back hundreds of years, and are rooted in Christianity (albeit a very liberal interpretation of it).  The principles that govern UU today were constructed by liberal Xians, even though the church (or association, if you prefer) today is open to all for free exploration of one's individual spiritualism and humanism.<br>
And anyway, heck, if Wiccans can have their own church--and you know the saying, ask 7 pagans a question, you'll get 10 answers--why can't a mish-mash of all faiths and non-faiths get together with one!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Better to learn from my Muslim friend and her family than someone who has since left the faith or was never in it or is a minister in another recognized faith.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, the UU churches in this area (my own congregation, and I read of others in the newspaper) often have speakers from various faiths come and speak, either at the service or at forums open to the public.  These are not people who have left the faith (and incidentally, one can be a UU and still not abandon their faith--that's kind of the point--and I know a few bi-religious couples who have opted to join a UU church so they may attend together while retaining their individual beliefs).  And if most of the Christians I know are any indication, it's fair to say that a person who has studied world religions and mythology at the graduate level probably is more knowledgeable than the practitioner of any given religion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sounds a lot like my sister’s Episcopal Church which is quite liberal and sounds nice, but still church and doctrine.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know you said you don't care what UU's believe, but I am curious--what exactly do you think UU's doctrine is?<br>

What seems to have set everyone off is my assertion that it is not necessary to bring children to church to educate them about religion. No one here has yet disputed that in any way. In fact, I would say we all totally agree about this, but that some of us prefer to or feel church is the best path. Indeed KMT said, “Letting kids &quot;choose&quot; a religion if they want when they become adults seems unfair to me if they haven't been given some kind of religious education” and went on to explain hers get this education in church.<br>
<br>
Here is my original response—<br>
&quot;1. There is a big difference between studying something and participating in it--especially harmful things like drugs, smoking, religion...  Do parents who use this argument apply the same logic to other life lessons? I haven't met one, but perhaps. <br>
What I suspect is really at hand is exposing kids to the social benefits of religion as perceived or missed by the parents (beanie dinners and fellowship). This is where I split with these other atheist parents, I don't see this part of going to church as a &quot;gift&quot;, rather indoctrinating kids into the &quot;fun&quot; parts of religion that will make it more difficult for them to leave it later or more likely they will fall into it as adults. For many questioning religion, it is not strict theology, but the social consequences and missing of holiday fun that holds them back from making the break.”<br>
<br>
If you aren’t an atheist parent, then it seems this last part of #1 doesn’t apply to you and if you are, it’s clear I feel you are doing something you feel is right and giving something to your children (hence the word gift) along the lines of what KMT describes as, “Because I have a son and I wanted him to be exposed to an organized religion without all of the dogma and structure the Catholic Church where I was raised&quot; and what Mony described as her &quot;fondest memories growing up are being part of our neighbourhood church--ham &amp; bean suppers, junior choir, ringing the bells after service. I want that for my children” <br>
<br>
Some of us want our children exposed to or experiencing organized religion—I don’t. some feel religion is harmless—I don’t. Some feel church is the best place to learn about religion—I don’t. As an atheist I don’t think this choice is evil, but I do think raising children with religious holidays/celebrations/rituals makes it more difficult to leave religion later. If you are UU and you want your kids UU, this hardly seems like a problem—in either case I never called out UU here or made the vicious attacks some feel went on, but if you were offended, it was not my intention. If it offends you that I think taking kids to church and participating in religous rituals/celebrations socializes children and makes it harder to break from religion, then I don't know what to say except go ahead and refute or debate it with evidence or logic...or say you don't care and you WANT this for your children as these other ladies did. <br>
<br>
”2. The argument is applied to xian or xian based churches mostly, so it also seems illogical to me as the only &quot;religion&quot; being exposed here is xian. I do know of a few atheists who attend Buddhist Temples and one who goes to Synagogue, but in both cases the children are exposed to xian celebrations and theology by other family and, sadly in public schools as well.”<br>
<br>
Here I DO call out xian churches so maybe noone took issue with this. Again, no mention of UU (which I would not have considered a religion yet, since I didn’t know they were recognized by the US gov’t as one with all the perks—and yes, tax breaks are perks no matter how you slice it. If they don’t want to be a recognized religion anymore, I am quite sure this could be changed with to complaint from Uncle Sam). If it offends you that I am shocked to find UU is a gov't recognized religion or that they get tax breaks, I can't help that. I am NOT a fan of tax breaks for churches in general, which is somwhat typical of politcally active atheists so this would not be specific to UU either.<br>
<br>
”3. If you're not looking for the tradition or routine of church, the chicken dinner/fellowship stuff, and can research, teach and discuss religion without the aid of a minister or person who attended seminary at home, then church seems to be what I think most religious folks see it as---a place of worship. Why do I need to take my child to a place of worship to understand what prayer and worship is? If I want her to learn about other religions the best place is from me, a formal education, the library or a person of that religion.”<br>
<br>
I guess I’m a little confused about why this was so offensive, when Rusty made the same point by stating, “The terms &quot;church&quot; and &quot;sermon&quot; have much more of a religious meaning, and &quot;atheism&quot; has much more of a religious-rejection conotation. One can go on and on about &quot;atheism&quot; being simply a disbelief or lack of belief in god/s, but the much more typical atheist tends to reject more religiousity and religious association than that nominal definition.<br>
<br>
Also, using terms like &quot;church&quot; and &quot;sermon&quot; is more distinguishing, if you will, than more nominally &quot;social&quot; groups.”<br>
<br>
I gave the definition of church and looked up religion too since someone here pointed out that perhaps my confusion stems from a misunderstanding of that word and spirituality--<br>
I know some here don’t recognize the dictionary as a valid source of reference, but for the record religion is defined as:<br>
Main Entry: re•li•gion <br>
Pronunciation: ri-'li-j&amp;n<br>
Function: noun<br>
Etymology: Middle English religioun, from Latin religion-, religio supernatural constraint, sanction, religious practice, perhaps from religare to restrain, tie back -- more at RELY<br>
Date: 13th century<br>
1 a : the state of a religious &lt;a nun in her 20th year of religion&gt; b (1) : the service and worship of God or the supernatural (2) : commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance<br>
2 : a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices<br>
3 archaic : scrupulous conformity : CONSCIENTIOUSNESS<br>
4 : a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith<br>
- re•li•gion•less adjective<br>
<br>
Hmmm...this just makes it more odd to me that a Humanist sort of group that is organized for social activism with no set belief system or dogma applied for the status of offically recognized religion and continues to keep it. Many are claiming I don't &quot;get it&quot;, but I don't see any arguments or evidence to straighten out the apparent contradiction in terms and status. <br>
<br>
And exactly how does this last part of my post attack UU specifically and cause so much darn defensiveness, “FOR US, taking her to church would seem to be conceding that we need this religious activity to fit in, feel good and be like others because we miss the feelings and associations of church. I don't want to do that and honestly do feel it is incongruous for atheist parents, who largely agree the motivation is based in some longing for things they got from regular xian churches. That's essentially why I disagree with the logic of the assertion quoted above both from a teaching/educational and atheist parenting perspective.”<br>
And how is it so terribly different from Rusty saying-“ Well, it seems incongruous to me, but whereas it fulfills/satisfies something in your life, the more power to ya.”<br>
<br>
It was from my friends and statements on THIS board that I got the idea the social aspects of church are what is desired outside of merely providing religious instruction--but we've covered that. Frankly, if this is what you're seeking, you should be proud of it and the fact your kids will want to go to church someday just as you are raising them (UU that is). <br>
<br>
For the record, it seems incongruous still, but as I have repeated several times, agree with Rusty’s feeling that “…if you feel it’s right for you then you should do it.” And went to the trouble to spell it out this way too, “My initial reaction to atheists in church was the same, but I say--to each his own. I totally disagree that you need to have kids experience church to understand religion … UUA seems to make many people happy, and those that still yearn for the rituals and traditions of religion without the spirituality seem to find this works very well in many places.”<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Do you ever wish to be in the company of people who are similiar to you? Who share the same worldview? Or do you like to always be on your own? I, personally, like to be around people who are facing the world as I am...with an open mind and heart. I don't particularly care if they are religious or not, just that there's respect all the way around. You don't need to be UUA to do that. But for me, where I live, it's a good chance for the exposure, and for the sense of community. Just because a person is anti-religious, doesn't translate into anti-community. Or at least it shouldn't. I repsect people who want to do it all on their own, but I don't think it's a liability, contradiction, or incongruous to seek community as an atheist.<br>
<br>
Other than that, I don't know what else to tell you. UUA evolved out of a formal religion, into what it is now, which is why many congregation pay taxes. Did you just gloss over that part?<br>

Yeah, I’m sure the LDS ladies and others here would say the same of how I see their religion and how I see it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I don’t know what to say to that except I can only go on what you and other UU say and what my friend who attended UU tells me outside of their literature. It is surely not one of my fascinations and I admit I don't feel compelled to join so perhaps we are at the same impasse with UU that I would come to about LDS or Baptist or Islam. You don't think I &quot;get it&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
“and you seem comfortable resting on it being a pseudo-religion, shadowing the tenets of a faith based organization, like a deity-lite church.”<br>
It is not my word to call this a religion, rather a UU person. Yes, I do see it shadow church (which qualifies as faith based) in many, many respects not the least of which are tax exemptions and language. I wouldn’t say it’s deity-lite, more like deity-mixed if the descriptions here fit and some believe and some don’t and some believe in different deities, but theology clearly enters in as the denial of the trinity is one of the tenets. This establishes a stand on a xian theological issue, but like other religions may not be held by all it’s followers. <br>
<br>
I do wonder if this perception of mine that UU is &quot;shadowing...a faith based organization&quot; is bothersome to the religious UU's. Do the xian UU's get offended that their church is called a religion or that it is seen to be structured as other churches are, or is that something that bothers the atheist/agnostic members more? My pagan friend who is very spiritual didn't seem to mind as much, which is what makes me wonder.<br>
<br>
“Do you ever wish to be in the company of people who are similiar to you? Who share the same worldview?”<br>
Yes, just like Rusty does and thousands of other atheists who don’t attend church. What does this have to do with church?<br>
<br>
“I, personally, like to be around people who are facing the world as I am...with an open mind and heart. I don't particularly care if they are religious or not, just that there's respect all the way around. You don't need to be UUA to do that.”<br>
ITA, neither do you have to attend church with your children. You choose to do so because it works for you. I find it incongruous with atheism and so do not. We just disagree, there is not one more morally superior or sinful here (at least from my perspective which doesn’t even believe in sin).<br>
<br>
“Just because a person is anti-religious, doesn't translate into anti-community. Or at least it shouldn't. I repsect people who want to do it all on their own, but I don't think it's a liability, contradiction, or incongruous to seek community as an atheist.”<br>
Again, we agree. I am very involved in my community, volunteerism, environmental/political/social orgs and friendships with like-minded and not so like-minded individuals. This is really at the heart of those Humanist and atheist orgs you mentioned.<br>
<br>
“Other than that, I don't know what else to tell you. UUA evolved out of a formal religion, into what it is now, which is why many congregation pay taxes. Did you just gloss over that part?”<br>
No-I addressed it in the very next post on that thread. Those congregations that remove themselves as formally recognized religions and pay taxes up front I would not have a problem. It doesn’t seem there’s one UU approach to the tax issue so perhaps that adds to the confusion and BTW just using this  $ for other good works makes them no different than any other church using it’s tax savings as they see fit.<br>
<br>
I don’t know what to add either, except that as long as UU continue to call themselves and be recognized as a religion with churches there will be confusion that does not exist for the thousands of other social groups that are involved in activism and provide a sense of community. I refer you again to Rusty’s words-<br>
<br>
“The terms &quot;church&quot; and &quot;sermon&quot; have much more of a religious meaning, and &quot;atheism&quot; has much more of a religious-rejection conotation. One can go on and on about &quot;atheism&quot; being simply a disbelief or lack of belief in god/s, but the much more typical atheist tends to reject more religiousity and religious association than that nominal definition.<br>

I do enjoy the UU church I attend but admit that I probably would not have joined if we hadn't started a family.  I also admit that the terms &quot;church&quot; and &quot;sermon&quot; do carry baggage from other organized religions for me.  But I've chosen to concentrate on the content of the organization, not the name.<br>
Below are the Principles and Purposes of UU from the UUA website.  I embrace the these statements and feel that exposing my son to a community of people who share these convictions can only do him good.  Whether or not he chooses to continue as a UU when he's an adult will be up to him.  I would also support his choice to join another organized religion.  Understand that supporting his choice would not mean agreeing with it or being happy about it.<br>

Your idea is exactly how I view it, too. I must not be like other atheists, then, either.<br>
<br>
Which is funny, because I thought being an atheist meant lacking a belief in the supernatural. Seeing how I don't believe in the supernatural, I thought that meant I was an atheist. I wasn't aware I had to actively eschew anything that remotely hints at a structured community of people who view the world with a similiar outlook.<br>
<br>
And ST,  as for the shadowing, and whether it is more upsetting to an atheist/agnostic or a Christian member of the congregation, actually, your posts, and Rusty's, but more yours, are really the only complaints or incorrect classifications I've ever been exposed to regarding UUA. I would assume that any member of my congregation would take umbrage at the generalizations and errant leaps you made, whatever stripe they might be personally.<br>
<br>
The members of my congregation, due to the nature of what we are, are actually quite relaxed about our congregation, how it functions, and the roles we play in it, when we function together as UUA adherents.<br>
<br>
If I get defensive, it's when I'm faced with people who are misinformed, and take leaps, such as you have, regarding it, and put things upon my membership, my congregation, onuses that simply aren't there.<br>
<br>
And quite frankly, this board  (and the board at BC, again from you) are the onlyplaces I've faced it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=encyclogirl1>Encyclogirl1</A> at: 5/22/03 4:00:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/breligiousdebate60574.showUserPublicProfile?gid=monynh>monyNH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#3333ff>(5/22/03 7:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/freligiousdebate60574frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=209.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Nope</span><hr size=1> &quot;I do wonder if this perception of mine that UU is &quot;shadowing...a faith based organization&quot; is bothersome<br>
to the religious UU's. Do the xian UU's get offended that their church is called a religion or that it is seen to be structured as other churches are, or is that something that bothers the atheist/agnostic members more?&quot;<br>
<br>
Regarding Xian UUs, this from religioustolerance.org:  &quot;Approximately 10% of UUs consider themselves to be Christians.&quot;  I think we'd be hard-pressed to find a Xian UU to give an opinion from that perspective.<br>
<br>
I would think that those atheist/agnostics who eschew any type of organised, structured service would not choose to be UUs in the first place, and those who are UU who are bothered by the functioning of their particular church are able to work within that system to change it.  Each UU congregation is self-governing and democratic, so anyone wishing to alter the existing structure of their church is free to bring it before the congregation.  We recently spent two Sunday services discussing our church's mission statement, and everyone's voice was heard, even the children (you'd be surprised how many kids would like to see RE classes conducted in a swimming pool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
As per the tax-exempt status thing, which seems to be an issue for you, I would point out that UU is not the only spiritual organisation to receieve that status and yet not hold a belief in a higher power.  This from an article on SOCAS in TX (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.infidels.org/activist/state/texas.shtml):">www.infidels.org/activist...as.shtml):</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> &quot;Ethical Culture fellowships have tax exemption in 13 other states and D.C.  Texas is the only state to deny them the exemption. The I.R.S. recognizes Taoism, Buddhism, Ethical Culture, Unitarian Universalism, and Secular Humanism as religions even though none require any god beliefs, and Secular Humanism flat out omits it.&quot;  The article goes on to discuss how the North Texas Church of Freethought has also been seeking tax-exempt status.<br>
<br>
But finally, I think that perhaps we (UUs) are running from the words &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;faith&quot;, and even &quot;worship&quot; needlessly.  I don't believe in a higher power, but I do believe in things, not least the 7 principles of UUism; I have faith in things.  Can an atheist not have a proscribed set of beliefs as well?  <br>
<br>
As for the &quot;worship&quot;, I just read a terrific sermon by Rev. James R. Bridges (full text at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://home.hvc.rr.com/uucrt/what_do_we_mean_by_worship.htm)">home.hvc.rr.com/uucrt/wha...rship.htm)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> where he states:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But let’s go back to worship, and take a look at the roots of the word.  I learned a long time ago, I believe while leading a course on Building Your Own Theology or On the Path to Spirituality that the term worship comes from the Old English “weorscipe.”  That is a combination of two words, which mean worth and -ship or shape.  Hence, the English term worship as a title of respect.  As a verb, the word meant to ascribe worth to – or to give shape to that which we find worthy.<br>
<br>
I would hope that that is exactly what we are doing on a Sunday morning here.  Giving shape to our concerns and issues, shape to those things we find truly of worth in our lives.  We create meaning in a sense of religious community. We actively celebrate and hold up for consideration of all our highest thoughts and endeavors.  <br>
<br>
Now some may say that I am playing with the definition of the word – that most people do not think of that meaning when they hear the word.  I have two responses.  First of all, all religions play with word meanings, use them in new ways for their members and followers.  That indeed is how worship came to mean what it does today – instead of staying with the root word.  Why should we be any different?  We too can redefine word meanings.<br>
<br>
Secondly, while most people may not think of worship as ascribing meaning and worth to something, I do believe that most people outside of our congregation would not hesitate to describe our Sunday services as worship, with or without the presence of theism.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

&quot;...actually, your posts, and Rusty's, but more yours, are really the only complaints or incorrect classifications I've ever been exposed to regarding UUA.&quot;<br>
Perhaps you can give an example of how Rusty or I &quot;complained&quot; or gave an &quot;incorrect classification&quot;. Perhaps you missed my large re-posting above where I had responded to churches generally. Where this UUA martyrdom is coming from, I can't say, but it is certainly not justified by any &quot;attacks&quot; or &quot;vicious&quot; statements made by myself. I've stumbled over myself to say you should do what suits you, but you're stuck on the word incongruous--and I though BC was too into politically correct.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;I would assume that any member of my congregation would take umbrage at the generalizations and errant leaps you made, whatever stripe they might be personally.&quot;<br>
Can you give an example of an &quot;errant leap&quot; that was totally unfounded by myself specifically toward UUA or are we still upset that I said &quot;it is not necessary to take a child to church to educate him/her about religion&quot;?<br>
<br>
&quot;And quite frankly, this board (and the board at BC, again from you) are the onlyplaces I've faced it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Can you provide an example from BC where I have placed an &quot;onus&quot; on the UU community or even commented on it? Do you not frequently advertise to newcomers and others about UU and UUA there including links? Have I ever once asked you not to do so on an atheist/agnostic board or even commented on it?<br>
<br>
Really honey--get off the cross already. For a group that has no problems joining right in with those who use the phrase &quot;wargod&quot; and &quot;skydaddy&quot; and were right on board with me regarding Joseph Smith your sensitivity to how well understood your church is by myself is unwarranted and quite odd since I was answering a general question and called out only xian churches in my response. Do I not like UU having tax exemptions just like other churches? No--you got me there and maybe there really are very different kinds of atheists---goodness what a shock that would be, but I hardly think my original statement was cause for all of this personal offense...and on a debate board where it's okay to tell working mothers (not fathers mind you---they're just fine) that they are unworthy of having children. <br>
<br>
You know, I honestly don't mind spirited debate and had a feeling that when I was asked to clarify why church is not mandatory to teach children about religion that there was something up and someone was looking for a fight--stupid me thinking this was like the other ez atheist debate boards and not so much an Orchard House replica. And now we have whining about UU attacks by myself on BC?!?!?!!? Wow--better put in a call to Rebecca and have me reported right away with some good evidence of it, or better yet, perhaps you feel (and can prove) that I've mistreated UU so badly on my atheist support board that I should step down there too. I must say, this kind of cattiness and irrational whining goes a long way in persuading me too. Say the word here or there and I'll go--it's not a paid position and I can't do more to support you there than I have so if I'm making atheists uncomfortable it is only right I step away...perhaps you would like to replace me and can personally e-mail me or Rebecca so we can get you the guidelines and such.<br>
<br>
It's been fun ladies, but as I said a few weeks ago, this is too much OH and not enough regular debate for my taste and the whole &quot;working mothers are evil&quot; thing still creeps me out, but let me know where I stand. I get enough of that shit at dd's school volunteer functions to be taking on hosting it online. Off to a funeral for my niece, but please do e-mail me with whomever wishes to replace me on BC and I'll make the announcement myself without referencing anything here. I'll just say I'm too busy or something or disappear with no word--it won't be a first there.<br>

<br>
So is the UUA an organized religion or not? Are you going to the UUA to expose your son to the community of people who have joined the UUA, or are you using the UUA to expose your son to organized religion (e.g. various forms of Christianity, or Islam, or Judaism, or ...)? Or both?<br>

<br>
And that's what an atheist is, so you're fine along those lines. Just because &quot;most&quot; that I've encountered eschew &quot;religious orgs&quot; (presuming for the moment that the UUA is a religious organization) doesn't mean that same is a prerequisite of some kind.<br>
<br>
This isn't a big deal.<br>
<br>
Encyclogirl:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your idea is exactly how I view it, too. I must not be like other atheists, then, either.<br>
<br>
Which is funny, because I thought being an atheist meant lacking a belief in the supernatural. Seeing how I don't believe in the supernatural, I thought that meant I was an atheist.

<br>
Well, one could argue that atheism isn't necessarily about disbelief in the supernatural. It's disbelief (or lack of belief) in deities. In fact, that supernaturalistic rejection is just as much of an &quot;assumption&quot;, if you will, as the eschewing of religious organizations. It's typical that atheists have a disbelief in the supernatural, but there are a few I've encountered that, though they disbelieve in gods, they still believe in, e.g., psychic phenomena (ESP, precognition, distance viewing) or other supernaturalistic things (e.g. ghosts, or, less supernaturally, Greys or Greens [aliens]).<br>
<br>
So, as I said to KMT above, you're well within the definition of atheism if you disbelieve in deities, and you're in the majority if you disbelieve in the supernatural. And it's not a prerequisite that you actively eschew religious orgs or some type of religiosity. But the statement that atheists &quot;actively eschew anything that remotely hints at a structured community of people who view the world with a similiar outlook&quot; is certainly not anything that I've argued or even hinted at, and I haven't followed closely enough to ST's posts to see if she's argued along those lines. And it certainly isn't true in the remotest aspect! Has someone else crossed some unfounded accusation line there?<br>

Okay, to reiterate: It doesn't matter to me, nor does it bother me that an atheist would belong to this organization. It surprised me a small bit, and I was curious as to why an atheist or two (from here) joined, but that's as far as it goes. It's not a criticism, and I don't think it's an incorrect classification to state that UUA has, at minimum, religious overtones, or at least the organization presents itself as more than merely a social group/&quot;structured community of people who view the world with a similiar outlook&quot;.<br>
<br>
From what I've read about the group, I think it would be interesting to go meet them once or twice, and I certainly agree that they seem to have very good ideals.<br>
<br>
But here's more that supports my position as the organization, at minimum, is presenting a &quot;religious&quot; front: In their <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.uua.org/newcomers/" target="top">Newcomer's corner</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, the navigation on the left-hand side include references to congregations, ministries, and a &quot;Church of Larger Fellowship&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'm not making any grandiose judgements about the organization, nor am I making grandiose statements about what a &quot;true atheist&quot; is supposed to be, or what organizations a &quot;true atheist&quot; is proscribed from joining.<br>

That said, I have enjoyed the debate.<br>
<br>
Mamagadfly: For the record I never got the impression that you were attacking the UUA.  My original request that you clarify was due to a sincere misunderstanding of your linking religion to drugs, drinking, etc.  I understand now that you believe that exposing children to any organized religion is bad.  I disagree (and isn't that a wonderful thing).<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Rusty:  I don't know where I gave the impression that I think the UUA is anything but an organized religion.  It certainly is and doesn't claim to be anything else.  But unlike other organized religions, it does not assume a belief in a higher power by it's members.  This is what drew me to UU as a good place to expose my son to religion without having to sacrifice my own beliefs (or force any beliefs on him).  He will be encouraged to find his own truth (whatever that may be).<br>

<br>
It was this curiosity that I, and I believe the other UUs, were addressing; and had the discussion not spiraled, it could also have been an interesting look at the nature and semantics of belief and faith (at least, that's where I was trying to take it, since at the end of the day I believe that is the real issue).  I'm sorry ST felt that she was being attacked.  I don't think she was, but neither do I feel that she was participating in the discussion in the spirit it was intended.  Case in point: her last post stated, &quot;Do I not like UU having tax exemptions just like other churches? No...&quot;, despite the evidence presented that many social groups such as some Freethought Society chapters and Ethical Culture Fellowship claim that same status, or that the IRS recognises Secular Humanism as a religion.  She chose to focus only on statements that she found inflammatory and offensive toward herself (and perhaps they were--but why not leave the personal crap out of it and focus on the topic at hand?) instead of addressing the facts presented.<br>

I don't think I'm the one prostrating herself on a cross. You keep beseeching me to read your posts, and I do, but when I report back on how they read, and what you say, you get inflammatory and personal. There's not a whole heck of a lot I can do with that. I've tried, Kelly tried, many other actual UUAs on here tried to explain, but you're content with how you see it. That's fine, but it doesn't save you from being wrong, and making it seem as if we've got some sort of problem.<br>
<br>
I said, several times now, that I don't care if you're happy in your misperceptions of what UUA is. That's fine. I just think, lacking understanding, and getting hung up on finer points that you've gotten wrong, means that perhaps, you should stop talking about UUA from an authoritarian position.<br>
<br>
That's what I meant. I didn't mean for you to call me &quot;honey&quot;, or for you to get agitated with me. I just answered the points you put forth as best as I could, and if you're not happy with the answers, because they don't go with your ideal, I don't know what to tell you, other than peace to you.<br>
<br>
I don't understand the resigning at BC stuff, but you seem to have been quite hostile lately, and feeling that people are attacking you all the time, when all I've seen are people who have a different view of the world than you do. As a freethinker, I would think you would embrace that, not get fired up about it.<br>
<br>
But I do apologize for ruffling your feathers. I just was hoping for understanding, and clarification.<br>
<br>
Peace to you.<br>

I remember it very clearly, although you may not, and it has always stuck in my brain that you have a predisposition against those who are atheists, yet go to church, in this instance UUA. You stated several times that you didn't understand it, and you doubted the strength of the atheism at that point.<br>
<br>
That's where I get it from. I don't hold it against you, because I truly think it stems from not understanding it. You get hung up on the word church, and that's fine, but it's better to recognize that and go on, rather than taking your toys and going home.<br>
<br>
And I have never thought of myself as advertising for UUA on BC. That's hysterical. Answering a question or two when brought up regarding UUA is quite different from setting up shop and trolling for members, but whatever.<br>

<br>
&quot;So is the UUA an organized religion or not?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yup, it's an organized religion.  Organized meaning we have ministers, set hiring guidlines, a national board, etc.  Nope, in that each member is free to follow their own path, each church is free to slant however they slant, etc.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me quote selectively, and watch for some editorial comments:&quot;<br>
<br>
Nice comments.  Words were chosen to apply to everyone; like you said, some can find hte deeper religious meaning if they so choose, and others can find the secular tone.<br>
<br>
#4 was an historical through in.  When the Unitarians and Universalists merged, neither really wanted to toally give up their separate religious history (Unitarians being the ones who flat out denied the Trinity, that Jesus was not the son of god,etc... Universalists being those who believe in universal salvation-not predestinity, or salvation by baptism, etc...) #3 and #5 include the other religions.  I believe #4 was separate so the &quot;where we came from, and those who still believe&quot; wouldn't feel chastised or out in the cold.<br>
<br>
(did that make sense????)<br>
<br>
&quot;But here's more that supports my position as the organization, at minimum, is presenting a &quot;religious&quot; front: In their Newcomer's corner, the navigation on the left-hand side include references to congregations, ministries, and a &quot;Church of Larger Fellowship&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Church of the Larger Fellowship is not really a church.  They have no church meeting house.  It's for those UUs who live in an area where there is no concrete church to attend.  They send out publications, you can order curricula for the kids and yourself, they write most of the UU curricula as well.  It's a support link for those UUs who live in the bible belt or way mid west or those who move overseas, or those who don't like the make up the the concrete church near them.<br>
<br>
As far as curiosity as to why an atheist would join- I was raised UU.  I've never belonged to another church or Sunday school, and yet all the teachings in the UU version of Sunday School, led me to atheism ( I think my sister and brother would agree there too.)<br>
<br>
As a UU I have the choice to see the spirituality (if you will) of the unset, of my sleeping child, and not the spirituality that hinges on a God.  I'd also have the choice to see the spirituality of the Goddess too.  UU's basically find the wonder in the earth for what it is, beauty that is to be appreciated; and not a God that needs to be thanked for it.<br>
<br>
One more example.  Our &quot;Christmas&quot; services is a good example.  Christmas, the birthday of Jesus, that miraculous birth...  We see that as a fable; look at your child, every birth is a miracle, every child is a wonder with potential, stars herald the birth of every child, every night. Children are special and have amazing potential no matter where they are born, no matter their circumstance. That the inn is famous for what didn't happen there, the inn was full, so Mary was shut out... what about our lives is so full and what do we shut out; love, family time, fun, talking...   It doesn't have to be about &quot;god's son&quot; being born, and there is no reason to completely shun the stories.  (Our church usually does a pagaent with a Mary and a Josephine having used IVF to concieve Jesus; it's quite hilarious when the girls get going, this past year, they chose to be Valley Girls with child and they found shelter in a casino)<br>
<br>
You can use the stories in the bible, just like you use &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; to teach about stranger danger, or &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot; to teach about telling fibs.  <br>
<br>
Oh and the part about athiests actively eschew anything that remotely hints.... that I believe was directed at ST.  She's a strong atheist, whilst the rest of us would be considered weak atheists.<br>
<br>
Going to church for me is a scheduled time in my hectic and fast life to slow down.  To ponder things, to actually sit and listen or play with babies in the nursery...  It's breathing room, it's rejuvenating, it's nurishment to my mind, heart and &quot;soul&quot;.<br>
<br>
Look at it this way, the Ra---- Jewish faith (I haven't had coffee yet) don't drive on the Sabbath, don't cook, don't handle money or machines, or shopping.  It seems like a whole lot of negatives to live by.  But look at what they do get, that slowed down day, candlelight dinner, time with family walking to Temple.  They have done thise for ages, and have achieved what millions of families are trying to accomplish with &quot;family dinner&quot; or &quot;family game night&quot;.  WOW.<br>
<br>
I don't cook on Sunday either (leftover night or order out), so that's what the UU church does for us (although I have to drive to get there)<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope I made sense, I'm off to get some coffee.<br>

Back about 6 or 7 months ago I had to complete a project for one of my classes and I came over to the UU board with my questions, and I remember I got hung up on the whole atheist part of UUism...It's something I couldn't quite wrap my brain around, for much of the same reasons that have been discussed left and right and up and down on this thread.<br>
<br>
After finishing my project, I think I now have a harder time understanding the Christian UU side...but I'm going to chalk that up to my &quot;fundi&quot; belief system.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One of these days, I may just check out our local UU church for the fun of it, and then maybe I'll be able to put to rest any leftover questions I still have. (My dh just shakes his head when I tell him this! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <br>

<br>
I know what you mean!!!! <br>
<br>
It took me many years to &quot;get it&quot;.  I think I have finally.  I had a hang up on the word Christian, much like atheist have a hang up on the word church.<br>
<br>
I didn't get it until last summer, when I was way early for a conference and went to the local library to just sit and read (ooo it was nice w/ no kids)<br>
<br>
anyhoo-  I picked up a book by Thomas Jefferson.  In it he wrote that he considered himself a Christian (which is where Christians will point to) but in the next paragraph, Jefferson explained that while he believed himself a &quot;Christian&quot; it wasn't (and in his terms) the Christianity of today [his today] that has been warped, misguided and totally changed from the original meaning of Christian as he had researched it.  <br>
<br>
So if you look at Christian meaning one who follows the words and teachings of Jesus, than yes, I can see UU Christians.  <br>
<br>
It's when you throw in the today versions of what Christians use to determine what a Christian is (Jesus son of God, only begotten son, saved through Christs grace.....) that UU Christian doesn't seem &quot;right&quot;. <br>
<br>
Today's UU Christians use a definition more along the lines of Jefferson's definition, than todays.  In my own words, they are more alongs the lines of a diest who identifies with Jesus.<br>
<br>
Does it make sense now?????&gt;D <br>
<br>
Glad your project went well.  We're quite an interesting group to study.<br>

Incidentally, a faction of the UUA has broken off to form the American Unitarian Conference (AUC), a theistic group that has returned to the original princples of Unitarianism in that they recognize a single deity (God) and &quot;recognize[s] Jesus, but not as part of a triune God.&quot;  Their seven principles (contrast with that of the UUA, posted above) are:<br>
<br>
              1. God's presence is made known in a myriad of ways. Religion should<br>
              promote a free and responsible search for truth, meaning, communion<br>
              and love.<br>
<br>
              2. Reason is a gift from God. Religion should embrace reason and its<br>
              progeny, including the scientific enterprise which explores God's<br>
              creation. <br>
<br>
              3. Free will is a gift from God. Religion should assist in the effort to find<br>
              a path that exercises that gift in a responsible, constructive and ethical<br>
              manner.<br>
<br>
              4. Conscious of the complexity of creation, of the limits of human<br>
              understanding and of humanity's capacity for evil in the name of<br>
              religion, we hold that humility, religious tolerance and freedom of<br>
              conscience should be a central part of any religious experience.<br>
<br>
              5. Religious experience is most fulfilling in the context of a tradition.<br>
              Our religious tradition is the Unitarian tradition, which emphasizes the<br>
              importance of reason in religion, tolerance and the unity of God.<br>
<br>
              6. Revelation is ongoing. Religion should draw inspiration not only from<br>
              its own tradition but from other religious traditions, philosophy and the<br>
              arts. Although paying due regard for the hard lessons learned in the past<br>
              and to the importance of religious tradition, religion should not be<br>
              stagnant but should employ reason and religious experience to evolve in<br>
              a constructive, enlightened and fulfilling way.<br>
<br>
              7. Conscious of the spiritual and material needs of our fellow men and<br>
              women, the evil they may be subjected to and the tragedies they may<br>
              endure, works of mercy and compassion should be a part of any<br>
              religious experience.<br>
