Laurena finished crafting the necklace and looked at it for a while to admire her work.  Then, satisfied, Laurena stood and walked out deeper into the surf, towards a rock that jutted out barely above the frothing waters.  Taking care not to fall, she walked out and placed it upon the rock.  <br>
<br>
She sighed and turned.  And froze for a moment, startled though she knew he had been there.  Aeli sat upon the beach, watching her quite closely.  She bowed her head to hide her flush, her hair whipping gently across the rose-stained cheeks.  Then she returned to shore, and with caution to make sure she was not bothering him, sat down in the sand.<br>
<br>
&quot;I made Tryphaena a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>mortuil</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,&quot; Laurena said quietly, watching waves, and more specifically, the necklace on the rock.  &quot;It will ensure her safe passage to the Fields Divine, or so it is said.  They say, that it is no matter how heinous a sin is committed--as long as just one person still truly cares and mourns them, they will find rest.&quot;  Laurena glanced down at her lap.  The beautiful dress she had worn just the other night was now torn and faded from the water.  But she could not meet Aeli's eye for fear she would be scolded for her coming words.<br>
<br>
&quot;I loved her dearly,&quot; she admitted softly.  &quot;As dearly as I would a sister.  I know the things she did were terrible--to you, to innocents, to me--but I cared for her greatly.  Despite her ways, if she had truly asked me to join her, all malice and manipulations set aside...I would have.  Is that wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
Somehow, her hand made its way to embrace the ankh around her neck as she watched the tide lift the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>mortuil</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> from the rock and carry it away to sea.<br>
<br>
&quot;I should have brought her back.  I have the gift...I should have...because...maybe she would have seen her error then.  She could have seen...that there was no need for her hate.  Because at least someone loved her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Long momens passed before she spoke again. The wind was very soothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope she'll find my<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>mortuil</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I hope she'll find her way to the Fields.  I hope...&quot;  She sighed, realizing her words were foolish.  &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br>

The child led him into a crude little hut, crude but sturdy.  She sat him down and took outa closed coconut that had been buried under the soil a bit to stay cool.  She opened it, and inside sloshed a clear, reddish pink liquid.<br>

Laurena was speechless.<br>
<br>
&quot;I...I amaze you?&quot;  Her eyes met his.  &quot;You amaze me too, Aeli...you're like no one I've ever met...I trust you.  I've never really...trusted...anyone before.  Not for a long time, anyway.  So, yes...you amaze me, Aeli.  You're kind and you're loyal to your friends, like Leon and Kain...and strong and brave like when you fought against Kaed.  Nothing like me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly Laurena's ears perked up, along with her head.  &quot;Oh!&quot;  She looked at him worriedly.  &quot;Kaed...he said something about meeting him at Tainu lake...in two weeks.&quot;  Her eyes became more and more troubled.  &quot;And Kain!  And Mae and the others.  Aeli, are they...alright?  Where are they?&quot;<br>

She wanted this to last forever, or only just a moment, before returning to cruel reality.  She was home, where she belonged, where she most felt safe.  The thought of ever being torn away from this again frightened her.  Terrified her more deeply than Tryphaena or cages or vampires ever had.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered gently, though she didn't agree at all.  &quot;Maybe we should...&quot;  Then, she laughed softly.  &quot;And I still didn't get to sing you the song I made for you.  Oh, well.  Maybe tonight.&quot;  She looked about her and blushed when she realized her position.  Her wings folded in shyness.  But she only came closer and held tighter, her eyes locked in his.<br>

&quot;They're starting already?&quot; Laurena said curiously, a smile coming to her lips.  She looked at Aeli fondly.  &quot;You don't have to be sad anymore, Aeli.  I'll stand with you, I promise.  So be happy, already!&quot; she laughed, tweaking his nose playfully before kissing his cheek.  &quot;Let's go before they start without us!&quot;  Laughing she grasped his hand and ran towards the
