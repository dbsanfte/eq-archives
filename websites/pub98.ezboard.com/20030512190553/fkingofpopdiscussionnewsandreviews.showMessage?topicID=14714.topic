<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="black"><b>The KOP Board is growing by leaps and bounds and there are a few newbies who don't understand what's allowed and what is not.  So here is a copy of the rules so no one misunderstands anything.</b></p>

<center><p>I've received a few questions about the titles given on the KOP to posters.  Here's a brief run-down of the titles.</p>

<p><b>Rockin Robin = Less than 100 posts posted</p>

<p>Off The Wall = 100 - 500 posts posted</p>

<p>Thriller = 500 - 1000 posts posted</p>

<p>Bad = 1000 - 2000 posts posted</p>

<p>Dangerous = 2000 - 3000 posts posted</p>

<p>INVINCIBLE!! = 3000 or more posts posted</p></b>

As for the posters who have the title Master such as the Music Master and News Master, these are forum hosts.  I either asked them or they asked me to moderate certain forums on the board.  Whichever forum they host is what influences their title.  

Hope that clears that up!  :)

<br>
Salah O. Ahmed | South End Staff Columnist <br>
<br>
   It seems race is on a lot of people's minds these days. The New York Times did a series on the subject recently, and the conclusion was that we, as Americans, have a long way to go before we can genuinely look past skin color and acknowledge one another simply as people. <br>
<br>
   The Free Press, which did its own series on race not long ago, found that in metro Detroit, people are choosing to segregate themselves, and when asked whether that constitutes racism, most of the people surveyed said, &quot;No.&quot; <br>
<br>
   When I was a kid, I remember grappling with race a lot. It isn't that I was confused, for as far as I was concerned I had no race. What interested me was the obsession others seemed to have with what to me was a figment of the imagination. <br>
<br>
   The few times I remember asking either of my parents whether I was white or black, my father, who is from the Sudan, and my mother, who is Polish, would invariably tell me the same thing: &quot;Son, you are not a color - don't let anyone reduce you to a skin tone.&quot; <br>
<br>
   Indiana, where I spent some of my childhood, was an unlikely place for diversity. I learned that each time I prepared to leave the confines of Bloomington, a college town, to go to any neighboring city. On the way to Indianapolis, for example, one had to travel through Martinsville, a city known for its KKK activity in the past. <br>
<br>
   It was common fare among black people living in Bloomington that taking the scenic route to Indianapolis, which took a lot longer, was better then going through Martinsville. <br>
<br>
   My father, who was teaching art education at Indiana University at the time, said he could never get a Sudanese friend to drive the easy way to the city. But he would make the trip alone, because in his mind, he was not a color. <br>
<br>
   And neither am I. But, if pressed to it, I am black like my father; not white, like my mother. And what has pushed me to that side is the awareness that there is strength in numbers. <br>
<br>
   The way I learned history, which was the same as any other American kid, revealed that black people here had to fight for as benign an issue as the freedom to drink from the same drinking fountain as white people. So, given the choice, I sided with the underdogs. <br>
<br>
   And though it was one thing to see the legacy of racism live on in a rural town, in a place like Indiana, I was disappointed to discover that racism was not an American phenomenon. I lived in Poland for a while, and people there were intrigued to no end by my background. Only their intrigue never seemed all that innocent. <br>
<br>
   For example, at age 15, I was at a friend's birthday party when a pretty Polish girl told me I spoke wonderful Polish. I described my dual heritage, to which she replied, &quot;Wow, so your father's black. You're lucky, cause you could totally pass for white.&quot; <br>
<br>
   That's when I discovered racism has many guises. It can even be friendly. What really grabbed me was that the girl apparently knew enough about geography and the world to know that Sudan is a country of black people. And that was confusing, because I had thought racism was connected to being an idiot.<br>
<br>
   Generally, that is the case. A few years ago, when I told an Indiana State police officer, after being pulled over, that I was from the Sudan, he asked me if that was by Muncie, a town near Bloomington. &quot;Yes,&quot; I remember telling him, &quot;and their basketball team is doing swell.&quot; <br>
<br>
   But here was a high school student who knew how the world looked, who was educated, and yet who thought it was a lucky thing to be white, and that black people walk around wishing they could trade in their skin for something lighter. <br>
<br>
   So, I concluded, there was this thing called race, and it gives no sign of wishing to go away. The New York Times was right and so was the Free Press. But I wish for a day when race does go away. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>   It was refreshing to hear Michael Jackson confirm the same idea in his song, &quot;Black or white.&quot; The lyrics said what I had always felt, &quot;I'm not gonna spend my life being a color.&quot; <br>
<br>
   The song was ahead of its time, and if I ever have kids, I hope they'll be jamming it until the walls shake, and then some. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>CHEERED GIS GET DOWN TO BUSINESS OF PEACEKEEPING </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
By JONATHAN FOREMAN <br>
<br>
April 25, 2003 -- BAGHDAD - The Scouts of the 4th Battalion/64th Armored Regiment headed off in their Humvees yesterday on a &quot;presence patrol.&quot; Their destination: the New Market district of Baghdad, one of the poorest neighborhoods on the West Bank of the Tigris. <br>
<br>
And once again they couldn't believe the movie-star treatment they received along the way. <br>
<br>
There were cheers as they drove through the streets. Passing drivers tooted their horns or gave them the thumbs up. Children waved frantically. Old men came up to shake their hands or kiss their cheeks. <br>
<br>
Even women waved from high windows or lifted their veils to show a flirtatious smile. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
And when they reached the trash-choked streets of New Market and parked their four Humvees, they were immediately mobbed. <br>
<br>
&quot;I couldn't believe it. These guys came up and kissed the flag on my shoulder!&quot; said Specialist Steve Beaman. <br>
<br>
The troops had no interpreter with them, but an English speaker was found among the locals: Hazeh Raheed, a chemist by training. Through him, a meeting was arranged with community leaders at the local barber shop. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Outside the shop, the crowd began calling out &quot;Mike Tyson!&quot; and &quot;Michael Jackson!&quot; at the only black soldier present, Staff Sgt. Darren Swain. When he told them his name, they started chanting, &quot;Swain! Swain! Swain!&quot; </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Inside the shop, Staff Sgt. Craig Hobbs - a veteran of peacekeeping in Bosnia - represented the Army. <br>
<br>
Through Raheed, Hobbs asked the group to list the district's five main needs. <br>
<br>
No. 1 turned out to be security, followed by medicine, stable currency and electric power. There was no No. 5. <br>
<br>
Hobbs told the gathering security is also a major U.S. priority, and promised to return to patrol the area that night. <br>
<br>
As for medical supplies, he said, Army medics would be in the area within a day. <br>
