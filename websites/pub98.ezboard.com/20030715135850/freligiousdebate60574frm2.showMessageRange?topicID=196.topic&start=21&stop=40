I think this is the sentence that got me going. I think why you got a big reaction was because most of SAHM feel like constantly need to prove ourselves. I think to a certain degree that at least for me I take a lot of flack from people for my choice. They can’t imagine why I would choose to SAH. They treat me as if what I do is not hard work or is less important than making money. I always get comments like &quot;I don’t know why you are tired or complaining, I would love to be home all day relaxing and playing with my kids&quot; That gets on my last fucking nerve. Makes me crazy that people think that you sit on your ass all day and the kids just magically get all their needs met. (I realize you didn’t say that.) I don’t have an issue with people who have to work or even want work part-time. I do get annoyed at people who know from the get go that there is no way they would ever want to stay home with there kids even if they could and *choose* from the beginning to put there kids in daycare. To me what is the point of having kids. <br>

That's a good point Leah, something I was thinking about that gets on my last nerve...workaholics who choose to bring children into this world, but the minute they are born they are thrown into childcare 50-60 hours a week.  Not the parents who have to work just to make ends meet, but the ones who choose their careers over their children...why have children in the first place?<br>
<br>
Once in awhile I get the urge to get back out there into the working force.  But then I slap myself right out of it.  What am I, nuts?  I'm doing what I love and what I've always wanted to do.  <br>

Before her latest job she was working rotating shifts of 12 hours - nursing. She didn't need to work. They could have scaled down their life styles. But for her, staying at home would be far far far more stressful then working. Working is a deeply engrained part of who she is. She has worked since she was 14. She NEEDs to work. And there are a lot of women out there who are that way. <br>
<br>
If I didn't have my own personal money, I would probably go back to work part time when DS turned 1 because I feel very very strongly that women should have their own money. <br>
<br>
While MamaG's first post, and to some extent her second post bugs me a little, I can see her point of feeling like she has to defend her choice to work. On this board it does seem that staying at home is the norm.  I personally admire those who work and parent because once a mother comes home I would guess that 75% of the time she is a full time mother - meaning without much DH help like in the middle of the night calls. <br>
<br>
But I could see how to MamaG it is relaxing to be that way. Because at home, those demanding on her love her. They give sloppy kisses and sticky hugs. They are thrilled to see you. And gotta say that my dd is usually a perfectly behaved child once DH comes home. Because he isn't worn out by that time of day of the constent pressure of dealing with an almost 3yo. She listens to him better. And She is his responsibility until bedtime. I'm done in by then usually. <br>
<br>
What I think makes staying at home so stressful (IMO) is the fact that most of what we do is unappreciated. It bothers me that DH thinks I've got it easy. Oh it really bothers me. Because I know on some days at work they watch movies and play video games. He points out that he gets up at 5am on the days he works. Ok he has to get up earlier then I USUALLY do (about once a week I'm up by that time). But on hte days he doesn't work (3 on 3 off) he sleeps until at least 10. Today I got to sleep until 7. I am usually up at 6. I would say that on average I'm up before himm, but he refuses to see that. I cook and half the time DD won't eat (thankfully DS will eat anything if he can feed himself). I wash laundry and fold it only to have to do it again the next day. It is rare for anyone to compliment on a clean house, or other things, but at 5am I hear if that laundry isn't done and DH has no socks or undershirt. <br>
<br>
I love my babies, but they don't appreciate my work for them right now. <br>
<br>
There are times when all I feel is wife and mother aka whore and maid. I have been struggling over the past couple of months trying to find something for ME. That is just about me. Maybe the kids can tag along, but I'm doing it FOR ME. And I'm having a hard time finding it and doing it on a regular basis. DH could really help out some more. But he's under the opinion that I don't need help. <br>
<br>
I got excited that I was running errands yesterday BY MY SELF. What would have taken me 2 or 2 1/2 hours only took me an hour! It was thrilling to be alone. To have my body to myself for an hour. And it was in the middle of the day. Sure I didn't go until DS was asleep, but DD was still awake. But see, right now even my breaks out are mostly dependant on how quick they will be or when DS is asleep.  The other night I decided I wanted movie popcorn so I decided to go see a movie (not much of a choice here). I couldn't get DS asleep, but DH for once said he would take him. So I went. And come home to find that DS screamed for 45 minutes. *sigh*That is more crying than DS does during the whole day usually. And I'm not sure the guilt I feel over DS crying is worth the break, even as needed as it was.<br>

<br>
Notice I clearly labeled it &quot;For me&quot;. I have many friends that work outside the home and do not have this problem. But MY job and MY situation led to it in MY life. So for me, the work was causing stress that I needed to get rid of. So I did. So actually, in a way, I agreed with Stacy that I was less stressed at home, though I know others that aren't.<br>

No need to say much more. The first MamaG post rubbed me the wrong way, and I know she tried, but the second one didn't really clear up that much for me. I don't think it's a question of misunderstanding what Stacy said, I think it's a sincere disagreement with the position she holds on the subject.<br>
<br>
I get you, Stacy, loud and clear. I just don't think you've got it right....I get that you support everyone's choices, but to me, it's not support when you announce that its easier to stay home, and much less stressful. Especially when you bump it with &quot;and I've done both&quot;. Part of support is letting people feel how they want to, and I think your whole post kind of invalidates those who do think it's challenging to stay home as making too much of it.....<br>

<br>
Actually, what I said was I had it easier being at work than my wife does being home.  I said it in the context of my job as contrasted to hers and relative to our individual skills at the roles we chose.  I de-stress when I get home by playing with my kids, reading, building with blocks or talking about their day over dinner.  These things however are not what the entire day consists of as a SAHP.  There is getting to school, packing lunches, getting to karate and violin, play dates, making sure enough books were read, art was made, exercise was had, enough milk is in the house, clothes are matched, no one is choking, laundry is wherever it needs to be (floor, hamper, washer, dryer, basket, drawer) dogs got out, cat got in, dishes were loaded or unloaded, and too much TV was not on.  <br>
<br>
There was a commercial once about shaving where you can see it as something you have to do every day, or as something you do for a lifetime, implying that a chore is only a chore if you see it as work.  I know several people that find repetitive tasks and habitual tidiness as rewarding and satisfying.  I am not one such person.  I go into a high pressure job, I am in law school at the same time, I argue all day long and I have more reading to face weekly than most editors plus I am quizzed on the material in ways that carry definite financial consequences.  There are those who would find that daunting and we have lost many who cracked under that type of pressure.  I however thrive and savor it.  I do not kid myself that I would do as well at home and as I said earlier because of the responsibility DW has to loved ones it is a “Way different order of pressure.”  Apples and Oranges really.<br>
<br>
Does this make me bad?  Am I a better person than a SAHP?  Do I think that if I became a single parent I would blow the job and my kids become disenfranchised criminals?  Are women the weaker vessel and must be shackled to the job?<br>
<br>
What I am is suited to the role I am in.  What my wife is is suited to the role she has chosen.  What we are is well matched and happy in our paths.  My wife is not very confrontational.  If she came in to my job she’d last about 8 seconds.  By the same token if I were to do hers we’d all have pink clothes and be eating spaghetti-o’s out of the can.  “From each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs.”  If I were to take a different job we’d have way less money (Lets not kid ourselves here that there is some altruistic reason for working.  We work to get paid.  I get paid enough so that she can work or not as she chooses, the household does not require it.)  <br>
<br>
Society is not holding guns to our heads and saying we must be breadwinner and chaimbermaid each. I kept working because I earned more.  I earn more than 4 out of my 5 siblings.  That’s just common sense.  If she earned more or we earned equally but I was a better SAHP then the choice would be different.  Can she have a career?  If she wants one.  Can she go to school?  I wish she would, but she doesn’t want to right now.  Her choice.  If I lost her and had to do it alone would I curl up and die?  No.  I’d probably be a damn good single parent.  I work very hard, I am semi-intelligent, I don’t just decide on gut instinct; my kids would be cared for and loved and raised to the best of my abilities.  If she wanted things differently, that is up to her to decide.  She can do anything she wants.  Just don’t project onto us some social inequity that isn’t there.<br>

Now it is a little off topic, but it sort of applies to this discussion.  <br>
<br>
Ok, this is more for the working moms more than for the SAHP, but any input would be good.  Also, if DBC could respond that would be great also, since he is the only guy that I know of that posts here.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am wandering how the household &quot;chores&quot; are split up in your household with both parents working?  In DBC's case I am wandering how things are now and how would they most likely be if his wife went to work?  And do any of you wives have a problem with your husbands treating your job or time less important?  (I am kind of leaning to if you make less money than your husband, but not excluded to that.)<br>
<br>
I doubt I would have even asked this question, but my husband (and my ex) did this to me today, and he has done it in the past.  ARGH!!  I try to analyze the situation and all I can think of is how is mom and dad are...I hope not!! <br>
<br>
Anyway, I am curious.  <br>

I do child care and chores that come up during the day, and then when dh is home, we split things about 50/50. The way it's worked out is that we tend to divide them out based on who likes what better...example, dh hates doing dishes, and laundry and I despise filing and cleaning out the cars....that kind of thing.<br>

<br>
Trish, I work part-time so I can answer from that perspective.  I do almost all of the housework-type stuff (laundry, cooking, cleaning, etc.) whether it is a working day or not.  My husband takes care of things like the trash, cars, all yard work, and &quot;fixing&quot; things.  We share in paying bills.  We don't deliberately choose gender-specific roles, we just do what we're best at so we don't have that pink underwear and bent riding mower blades (which happened both times I drove it) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Obviously, on my days off I take care of dd.  When dh comes home he knows I need a break and he usually takes over for the rest of that day/evening with her.  When we're both home, we share equally in taking care of her.<br>
<br>
&quot;And do any of you wives have a problem with your husbands treating your job or time less important? (I am kind of leaning to if you make less money than your husband, but not excluded to that.)&quot;<br>
<br>
Not at all in my case.  Working part-time I make about half what he does, but that is not an issue.  All the money goes into one pot anyway, and he has always treated my career with as much respect as his own.  He also recognizes and appreciates that I work just as hard or harder on my days at home with dd.  I guess I'm really lucky <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

On the finances, I do them because dh hates it. Sometimes I don't think he has a clue what is IN our accounts!<br>

I handled all the finances, bills etc, I handle the car for the most part, if it needs fixing- I handle it, cooking - totally my chore, along with the rest of the household chores including taking out the trash and recycling. And this would not change if I went back to work. Its one of the reason I won't go back to work even when I wonder if I'm truly suited to be a stay at home mother. <br>
<br>
I did blow up at DH, especially when he insinuated that I don't work. And that I have it easy compaired to him - HAHHA some days all they do is watch movies, oh yeah he has it so hard. He mouths that he knows how hard I have it, and then at the same time makes a statement saying how it isn't hard. This brought out the chore board. So he suppose to do one or two chores on his day off - easy damn chores too, maybe another small chore on a work day - like taking out the recycling - and I usually put him a day off from all chores on a work day and a day off because hey, he does work. So that's a total of 5 days of chores. None of them hard. Simple things like - dishes. Or pick up the living room toys (and if its a work day I put in with me). Once a week I put that he is to take out DD so I can have one day to really clean, but now that our baby is mobile I need to add him to that chore - this might make it hard for DH he is uneasy with babies. <br>
<br>
But you get the picture right? Simple chores. Trash, dishes, maybe laundry which is the hardest chore on there (and he doesn't ruin laundry he is pretty good at it). Well half the time he doesn't do them. The chore list is on the fridge. He drinks at least 6 cokes a day (addict) and he says he didn't see the chore. <br>
<br>
So how is that suppose to make me feel? I tell ya, it makes me feel like a fucking slave is how it makes me feel. But then I knew he was like this before I married him so I can't bitch too much. And when I worked and he didn't (6 long long damn 6 months - hurray for the military he can't quit now for at least 2 1/2 more years) I still did the chores around the house. All of them. Including mowing the lawn. I could shoot his parents for raising him like this. But then I married him knowing this. He isn't malicious with it. He just doesn't get it. Its sad, but when he remembers that the board has chores for him, he happily does them. <br>

My DH is one of those people who enjoy cleaning and putting around (I know very disturbing). On the other hand I hate it. I try to do most everything but whatever I don’t do DH does. We also have a deal that after our kids are old enough to not need to be BF in the middle of the night he gets up with them if they wake up. If they are hungry then he will wake up me up. He has spent countless nights sleeping on the girl’s floor. He also does bath time because I hate giving the kids a bath and he puts Bella to bed (I put Halle to bed). On the weekends he is in charge of feeding everyone. So I can take a brake from having to get up and make breakfast. So I think we do a good job of dividing the responsibilities when he is home.<br>

Okay, so Stacy thinks it is easier to SAH.  Maybe for her it is, but others feel differently.  Everyone has different circumstances.  If you leave a stressful job to stay home with a child who is pretty well behaved most of the time, then you may find it easier to SAH.  That doesn't mean it is the case for everybody, but the person who does fall into that category shouldn't be attacked.  I work full-time for part of the year, and part-time for the rest.  The less I work, the less stress I have.  The reason for my particular situation is because I only have one child at home, and he is extremely well behaved.  He has his moments, and there are days where I go nuts at home with him, but that kid is a breeze to raise, and if that was my only job, then it would be much less stressful than coming into this office and staring down this pile of audits I need to finish.  Once this next baby comes along, then that may change.  I may find my days at work to be less stressful than my days at home trying to take care of 2 kids and a house, especially if this baby isn't as easy as my first one. <br>
<br>
As for the comment about how people who choose to work shouldn't have kids, I find that judgemental as well.  I work because I have to, but if I didn't have to work, then I would probably at least stay working part-time.  I know part-time isn't the same as choosing to work full-time, but there are a lot of mothers out there who choose to work full-time, and they still do a great job at raising their kids.  First of all, what is the difference between sending a child to daycare because you have to as opposed to doing it by choice?  Either way, the mother will be at work and the child will be in daycare.  I know there are parents out there who are more concerned with climbing the corporate ladder than taking care of their children, but those types of parents wouldn't be much different if they stayed home.  I've seen children of both working and SAH parents who are neglected.  Neither one is better than the other.  Some people just have the types of personalities where they need stimulation outside the home.  I question all the time whether or not I'd be able to tolerate staying home full-time.  I'm just lucky that my career path led me to a job where I can work just part-time, and still make enough to cover daycare.  Some people don't have the part-time option with their jobs, regardless of finances.  Certain jobs just can't cater to anyone who is there less than 40 hours a week.  If a woman has this kind of job, but she doesn't think she would do well as a stay home mom, then the family is better off with her working.  That doesn't make her less of a mother, she is just wired differently.  Besides, people who work by choice don't always just blow this extra money on themselves.  They have college funds for their kids, they have retirement funds so they won't be a burden to their kids in their old age, they can afford extracurricular activities which are good for children and they can afford family vactions in order to provide their kids with positive childhood memories.  As long as the children always come first, then working does not hurt the children.<br>
<br>
With all that being said, I think there are 3 necessary factors that need to be in place in order to have a good balance when one parent works outside the home.  You need a good partner, good daycare and a flexible job that understands family comes first.  I am very fortunate because I have all 3.  My dh and I split all the household chores and child duties.  When I work less, then I do a little more.  If I need to stay late on night, then I know my dh can hold down the fort.  That part also answers the other question about splitting the chores, lol.  I also have an excellent daycare situation.  My son absolutely loves his daycare, and it has been a very positive experience.  I know he is in good hands when I'm gone, and I know he isn't suffering in any way.  I also have a flexible job.  If I get a call saying that my son is sick, then I don't need to ask if I can leave.  I tell them I'm leaving.  I don't need to clear doctor's appointments ahead of time, and if I feel like taking off early because there is a special party or carnival at the daycare, then I just leave.  To be fair to my employer, I sometimes take work home or swing by on the weekend during his naptime in order to make sure things are still getting done.  I am very fortunate that I have all the right tools in place to create a nice work/life balance.  If any one of those 3 factors fell apart, then things would be going a lot differently.<br>
<br>
When it comes to the general subject of WOH vs SAH, then I'll just reiterate that it all depends on the individuals involved.  Finances are usually the driving force in this decision, but it also helps when you look at the people involved.  The reason why I wonder whether or not I'd be able to stay home is because I'm not sure if it fits my personality.  With the exception of cooking, I hate hate hate domestic duties.  If my income was all disposable, then I'd hire someone to clean.  I've done that in the past, and I plan to do that again.  I also need a certain type of stimulation for my mind.  I didn't choose to be an accountant because it is a glamorous job.  I chose to be an accountant because it fits with the way my brain functions.  I'm a real puzzle person, and this was the perfect fit.  It is hard to say whether I'd function well if I didn't have this outlet to allow my brain what it does best.  If my talents lied elsewhere, then maybe I could squeeze that in at home.  A lot of stay home moms like to do crafts.  This suits them well, and it is a perfect fit within their domestic life.  I suck at crafts, and I have no creativity at all.  I'm thankful that Dylan's daycare does all sorts of neat arts and crafts with him because I can't offer him that kind of creativity at home.  For the most part, I work because I have to.  My dh makes good money, but we came into our marriage with a lot of debts because we had to financially struggle in order to make our way through school.  We came from middle class families that made too little to pay for college, but too much to qualify for much in the way of financial aid.  Some of our debts were by choice.  We had a vision of what we wanted to provide for our children.  It was important for us to raise our children in a house, and that this house be in a safe neighborhood with good schools.  It was also important to us to make sure we had safe and reliable vehicles to drive our children around in.  Everyone has different visions of how they want to raise their children, but these things were important to us.  The most important thing here is that Dylan is happy, and he is.  This is our personal story, and other people's circumstances may not fit in here.  This is why people need to consider what is right for them from finances down to personalities, and to make a choice that is right for you.  Just remember that what is right for you may not be right for another.<br>

Trish—“Anyway, I am wandering how the household &quot;chores&quot; are split up in your household with both parents working?”<br>
We both do what needs to be done, though I love cooking so do that mostly and love to mow the lawn, but in AZ it’s mostly rock, so Dh does the tree trimming. We take turns waking the children except during the week when dh mostly gets ds and I get dd ready. We all clear the table as a family since we eat there every night.<br>
<br>
BTW--I find the several comments about men being less suited to care for children distressing and disgustingly sexist. (Not individual comments, the general ones). If a man gets his children from bed, tucks them in, helps dress and feed them and be a full partner in their lives he will not lose control when left alone with them for 2 hours and should, in fact, relish the time. My dh does, but then we're just freaks that way too<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

All I said was that I get annoyed not that I sit at home and think you suck or you are a bad parent. I never said anything about your thoughts about how it is relaxing to come home to your kids.

Let's take another look at what I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>actually</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> said: <br>
&quot;Choosing to have a career <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>OVER</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> your children&quot; (the general statement I made, that was never directed at you - yet you seemed to take way too personally!)<br>

Now, if that's indeed what you are doing, then I am sorry...but my opinion on the matter still stands.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if what you are actually doing is choosing to have a career <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WITH</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> children (which is what I believe you are doing), then my post never even applied to you. <br>
