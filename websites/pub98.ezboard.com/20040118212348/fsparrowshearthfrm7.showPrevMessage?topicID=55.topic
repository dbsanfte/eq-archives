Hebrews 10:31 syas, &quot;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&quot;  Jesus is holy and omnipotent and the protector.  He really isn't safe.  But I think that a little analogy is appropriate here:  You wouldn't call a Marine a safe person, I think, if you tried to mess with him when he was on-duty.  (I apologize for the American-centeredness of this... the Marines are the toughest people I can come up with.)  This is like Jesus: when you try to treat Him as less than he is, or don't approach him with the awe and respect He deserves, then He can be very dangerous.  Look at the extensive rules surrounding going into the innermost chamber of the Temple: one had to be completely clean and confess all sins before going in.  So I don't think Jesus is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>safe</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, per se, but he is a protector, and one that I would rather side with than side against. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bsparrowshearth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkmast03>darkmast03</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><span style=color:green;> <b>The Dark Knight and <br>Torchbearer of the<br> Tournaments!</b></span></span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#B87333>(12/9/03 3:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fsparrowshearthfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   C.S.

<br>
Although Lewis wrote the Chronicles of Narnia with children in mind, he also wanted the stories to appeal to adults and to convey a larger message. Thus the story of Narnia can be read and enjoyed on another level, as the story of Christianity as it is told in the Bible. Aslan the lion represents Jesus Christ, who died as a sacrifice to God for the sins of all people and then came back to life before ascending into heaven. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>In 1954 Lewis explained it this way in a letter to some Maryland 5th graders: &quot;I said, 'Let us suppose that there were a land like Narnia and that [Jesus], as he became a Man in our world, became a Lion there, and then imagine what would happen.'&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
As far as your question Peaches? I suppose it's all in how you look at it.  The world definitely isn't safe, for those who are saved, and in that respect Jesus is our refuge, our Rock and the only safety we have.  In another respect because we are Christian's and His children we aren't safe, physically, because we are in this world.  <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1John 3:13-14 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>John 15:18-21  If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before [it hated] you. <br>
19  If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. <br>
20  Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. <br>
21  But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Another thought on the matter is that because Jesus holds judgement over those that are unrighteous, HE is dangerous.  In that respect I can agree as well.  <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Matthew 10:28  And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

<br>
I think you are probably thinking of Tolkien.  He vehemently stated that the Lord of the Rings was not an allegorical Christian novel.  If he says so, then that's true - from that point of view.<br>
<br>
However, Tolkien was a very devout Christian (Roman Catholic), and I don't think it's possible for someone that sincere in the faith to write something <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>without</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a Christian element becoming a part of the story.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, Tolkien and Lewis were very close friends, and Tolkien was partially responsible for convincing Lewis to convert to Christianity.<br>

Sorry for the tangent there.<br>
<br>
I'm still thinking about the original question.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to think of ways in which Jesus isn't safe - to beleivers.  Because I can see Him not being safe to non-beleivers.<br>
<br>
The only thing that I keep coming up with is change.  Change - even when beneficial - is scary.  When you come to accept Christ, you are changed and you do give over your life to Him.  At least initially, this can be scary.  Maybe that is somewhat &quot;unsafe&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, that's probably a stretch, but it's the only thing I can think of at the moment.<br>
<br>
There has to be a commentary about this somewhere.  I'll do some digging. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man.<br>

It is easy enough to see Christianity in LOTR but, if you try to make everything fit an allegory, it doesn't work and it gets all confusing.

The first chapter of the Silmarillion and the creation of the universe is obviously allegorical.  Especially Melkor's dischord.  When you read that, well, it is just so similar to the rebellion and fall of Lucifer. <p>Christians know that it is not possible to reject or ignore God without demeaning man.<br>

That's my thought too.  He's dangerous to those who don't belong to Him because He brings a devastating judgment with Him for those who are not His.  He's particularly dangerous to the devil, who probably thinks of himself as some kind of an equal who has power to overthrow God.<br>
<br>
But for those of us who belong to Jesus, I can't see Him as being unsafe for us.  He would be dangerous for us if He didn't keep His word - if we couldn't trust Him to do what He says.  That on a whim, He could simply disown us at will - then He would be dangerous to us.  But the fact of the matter is, He won't just let us go and will not take His grace away from us after we've asked for it.  He is trustworthy and can be taken at His word.  We know He won't lie to us or beat around the bush and mislead us.  So He's safe because we can trust Him and know that we belong to Him and are His for forever.<br>

I have never thought, or even wanted to think, of Jesus as my &quot;buddy.&quot;  I might use that term tongue-in-cheek with people I consider friends.  But I've always believed that there needs to be a bigger level of respect for Jesus than that.  I try to avoid talking tongue-in-cheek to Him as I don't think He would ever talk to me that way.  If that makes sense.  I'll talk that way more with people I consider my equal.  I don't consider Christ my equal because Christ is so much more higher than I am.  I am below Him and as one respects those in authority over them, you speak respectfully to those over you.  That's how I was raised anyway.<br>

<br>
Two different scriptures - one claiming God as Lord of lords and King of Kings, another claiming Jesus as Lord of lords and King of kings.  As God can not share His traits with anyone else, He and Jesus are one.  (Okay, but this isn't a trinity thread so if anyone wants to argue that, please start a new thread.)<br>
<br>
BTW, I just love that last verse where it says, &quot;and who lives in unapproachable light.&quot;  I think that is just so poetic and beautiful.  What a vivid description that gives.  I love it.  It's such a wonderful verse. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So yeah, I agree that we shouldn't think of Jesus as our &quot;buddy.&quot;  I think that shows a lack of respect.  But we certainly can call Him our friend and I consider Him to be my best friend.  And as my best friend, it stands to reason that I would show Him nothing but love, admiration and respect, for He has never shown me anything but those, and He is certainly more worthy of them than I am.<br>
<br>
We should never talk to Jesus any more casually than He would talk to us.  And to think of one who is King of kings and Lord of lords, I automatically would expect to speak up to Him, not down - just as we would to a human king or lord.<br>
<br>
However, Jesus wants us to be honest and our honesty is not going to take Him by surprise.  He already knows how we talk and Jesus doesn't strike me as the type to say, &quot;You've gone too far, you need to speak more respectfully to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think the fact is, when we first come to Christ, He wants us to be candid with Him.  He wants us to be painfully honest about everything going on in our lives so that He can heal us.  And as we grow in Him, we start becoming more like Him and the respect that a mature person would show to someone in authority simply comes naturally to us because Christ's nature is taking over our sinful nature.<br>
<br>
But if you think about a little child who has been bullied all day by kids at school or kids in the neighborhood, they're teachers pick on them too, they feel all this hurt and pain, they come home from the day and there's daddy to ask, &quot;How was your day?&quot;  You can't expect that little child to sit there and look at his daddy and say, &quot;Dear Father, my day was horrible.  Please teach me how to handle the problems I am faced with day by day.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, that child is going to be extremely candid with his daddy about the horrible things going on his life.  He may scream and cry.<br>
<br>
Then think about an adolescent, going through the same problems in life.  But this kid is a little bit older and understands things a little bit better.  Maybe he's been living his life according to his dad's rules and expectations and because of that, he's being ridiculed and scorned by the world around him.  The adolescent feels hurt by the world, but in his adolescent mind, he's starting to think &quot;Hey, this is dad's fault for making me live according to his rules.  If dad didn't put such a high standard on me, I wouldn't be having these problems.&quot;  So the adolescent feels some anger directed at his dad.  That anger isn't going to be resolved unless he can come to his dad and say, &quot;I blame you for my troubles in life.&quot;  At which point, the dad can try to explain to the adolescent why it's necessary and worth the heartaches in this life to live that way.<br>
<br>
Likewise, with God.  I believe that as we grown in Christ, we hit an adolescent stage in our faith.  That point when we start thinking, &quot;Hey, if I wasn't living according to God's rules, I could do anything I darn well please and wouldn't be treated so horribly by others.&quot;<br>
<br>
God knows when we think that way.  He's not going to buy it for a second if we come to Him and start praying formally, &quot;Dear Father, please forgive me for my sins and help me to deal with the pain and pressures of life.&quot;  He'll know we're being fake because He knows on a deeper level, we're blaming Him and He wants us to be open and honest with Him and say that to Him so that He can show us why it's necessary.<br>
<br>
So what I'm saying is yes - talking to the Lord respectfully is important and what we should do - but it also comes naturally as we mature in Christ and we shouldn't be lecturing others to do the same because they are most likely at a less mature stage in their relationship with God where they need to be candid with God.  Because speaking to the Lord respectfully comes with maturity in Christ as Christ's nature overtakes our sinful nature and we become more like Him.<br>
<br>
I hope that made some sense.<br>
