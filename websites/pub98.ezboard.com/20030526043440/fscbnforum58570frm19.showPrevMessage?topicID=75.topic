<br>
“Bless me, father, for I have sinned. It has been… many, many years since my last confession.”<br>
<br>
“Tell me, my son, why have you neglected your faith for so long?”<br>
<br>
There was a long pause.<br>
<br>
“I suppose its because I thought God had abandoned me, or at least my faith in him had abandoned me.&quot;   <br>
<br>
&quot;God does not abandon anyone, my son. Even those who sin against him. His forgiveness is greater than you can ever know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me, Father, what does one do if one is eternally and irrevocably damned?&quot;<br>
<br>
The clergyman seemed to pause at this.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not sure I understand your question, my son.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean, if someone who by their very nature were condemned to hell asked you for advice, what would it be?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My son, I sense a great burden upon you. Please, let me help you relieve it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know if that's even possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me your sins.&quot;<br>
<br>
After a long pause...<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a parasite, Father. I feed off of others. I am resentful, angry, and bitter. It is all I could do to forsake vengeance against those who had wronged me and mine, but still, the hole remains. I feel the world has done me great injustices. Whereas I’m forced to scrap and beg for table scraps, others are invited to sit at my master’s table, and fill full. Others benefit from my sacrifices, while I am chastised time and time again for those same acts. I know I should draw strength from this, but yet, I am still disheartened. So now I turn to a God I thought had abandoned me years ago for guidance.”   <br>
<br>
“My son, do you remember the story of the Prodigal son?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, Father.”<br>
<br>
“Good. Your situation draws similarities from both brothers. Like the youngest, you now return home. Our Father, the lord in heaven, will accept you back, even if other children resent you for it.”<br>
<br>
“Like the eldest, you feel wronged that others are welcomed openly while you feel ignored. But as their father said unto his eldest, all that he has is now yours. Your time will come. Until then, be happy with what you have, and know the time of your recognition will come.”    <br>
<br>
“God is always watching, and He is there to guide you. He will even send servants to watch over you in times of trouble.” <br>
<br>
“I think I’ve already been visited.” Mused Crowley.<br>
<br>
“Are you saying you’ve already felt the presence of an angel?”<br>
<br>
Crowley suppressed a chuckle. “Something like that.”<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. And remember, my son. God is always listening. If you choose to believe that there is nothing you can do to redeem yourself, you will never be able to lift this burden. But the best piece of advice I can give you is to live in the present, and let your actions determine your fate. Until then, if you wish to repent, start with ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Mary’s, as it has been so long. And please, do not be a stranger to the church.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley nodded, and reached inside his jacket. &quot;Father, you've been a great help to me. Please accept this token of my appreciation for the church.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley slid a stuffed envelope through the crack in the barrier. He stood up, collected his jacket and walked out of the confessional.<br>
<br>
A moment later the priest’s door also opened. Crowley looked back at the man. He seemed to be in his late 60s, slightly heavyset. He had a look of kindness in his eyes, which at the moment was spoiled, by the look of astonishment on the man's face. No doubt very few people who had bared their souls to the man had made such extraordinarily generous financial contributions in return.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Crowley smiled weakly at the man, then turned around and continued to walk down the aisle. He rather liked this priest. Perhaps in the future, he could develop a contact with the man that could be turned to his advantage.    <br>
<br>
Assuming, of course, he had a future.<br>
<br>
Crowley paused at the font, the bowl at the entrance of the church where holy water was kept.  <br>
<br>
He hesitantly dipped his hand in the water...<br>
<br>
... And felt no pain. No burning of his flesh. He smiled. Perhaps the priest was right after all. Crowley blessed himself and walked out of the church, got in his car, and started to drive home.     <br>
<br>
&quot;Still lamenting, are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley slammed on the brakes, regained his senses, and then pulled over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Roche?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I found that little engagement at the church to be quite entertaining, but also a cause for concern.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;But... your gun isn't here. I'm completely clean...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not needed. Your mind gives me a voice. Besides, I rather dislike the idea of a member of our clan developing a taste for tainted blood. It can have... unfortunate side effects.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you wish of me, sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;First, I'd rather not simply sit here. Perhaps driving will help you think better.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley pulled back into traffic and started to drive again.<br>
<br>
&quot;How long has it been since you've been in a church, Crowley?&quot;<br>
<br>
Crowley thought back. Even before his Embrace, he had avoided them... <br>
<br>
&quot;40 years. My Mother's funeral.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;40 years. You never even attended the funerals and weddings of friends and colleagues, did you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So what brought this sudden desire for spiritual enlightenment?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why is this important, Mr. Roche?&quot;<br>
<br>
“You came dangerously close to endangering the Masquerade in there.”<br>
<br>
“I revealed nothing of my true nature.”<br>
<br>
“You said more than you should've, and if you needlessly take risks like that again, I will stop you.&quot;     <br>
<br>
“I thought you said you weren’t here to stop me or keep me going. Just to give me a sense of direction – show me the path to follow.”<br>
<br>
“I said that, and its true. I am only here to give you a sense of direction. And if I feel you’re endangering the Masquerade, I will direct you to pick at that little space in the back of your head you've been so obsessed with and destroy yourself.” <br>
<br>
“Do you really think you could make me do that?” Crowley asked.<br>
<br>
There was a long moment of silence as Crowley continued to drive.<br>
<br>
“Point taken.” Crowley said, finally.<br>
<br>
“Excellent. Now we understand each other.” <br>
<br>
Crowley said nothing for a full minute. <br>
<br>
“Even if I had told him something potentially damaging, he could not have repeated it.&quot; <br>
<br>
“Again, Crowley, you fail to see the point. The church was built by people. People are fallible, no matter how great their intentions.”<br>
<br>
Crowley thought about this for a moment. <br>
<br>
“And the Camarilla was built by Kindred.”<br>
<br>
“Exactly.”<br>
<br>
“And so the Camarilla is fallible.”<br>
<br>
“As painful as it is to say, yes. Perfectly loyal Kindred of the Camarilla break the traditions everyday. We ourselves did this.” <br>
<br>
&quot;And do you think God will ever forgive me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you really need to approach your problem this way, Stephen Crowley? By some previously forgotten religious values? You will understand if I find that distasteful, but very well. I will humor you.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;If you believe the Noddist-Biblical version of our creation, you believe that Caine, committed the first murder of all time by slaying his brother. For doing this, he was cursed. He could not survive in daylight, he had to feed off the blood of others, and he feared fire. As you well know, those curses survive with us today.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But God did something else to Caine that day, Crowley. He gave him extraordinary power. He gave him immortality. In effect, he made him the most powerful creature on Earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Caine used his power to build Enoch, the first city. He Embraced childer. He taught them how not simply rule Kine, but how to lead Kine. How to guide them. Teach them to hunt, farm and live. He did this in the hope that someday, his great crime would be forgiven, and he and his childer would be redeemed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But Caine's children, our forbears, corrupted that rule. They quarreled amongst themselves, eventually shedding each other’s blood. They abused the power and the Kine that Caine had intended them to protect.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To punish them for their insolence, God sent the Great Flood upon them. Enoch was destroyed, and Caine and much of his childer were either destroyed or went into hiding.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For the next several thousand years, the descendants of Caine continued to manipulate the Kine. They continued to quarrel amongst themselves, ignoring their obligations. Our own clan, certainly, was not innocent in any of this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And so God sent down a new punishment, this time one designed to force the Kindred to behave themselves. He sent the Inquisition, and for perhaps the first time ever, the children of Caine truly came to fear the Kine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And so a new Enoch was founded. This one built not on a foundation of bricks and mortar, but rather on respect for those values that would keep Kindred safe -- the Traditions. It was called the Camarilla. And, if given time under strong, enlightened leadership, it would have the chance to redeem us all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But once again, the petty concerns and bickering of the separate Clans and individual Kindred turned the Camarilla into a weapon to be used against each other. And the dream became tarnished.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And so here we stand, Crowley. The children of Caine have been given opportunity after opportunity to redeem themselves, and gone the other way. As a result, I find myself dead, and you find yourself dwelling on the meaning of your existence.&quot;   <br>
<br>
&quot;And what does this have to do with me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Crowley, it has EVERYTHING to do with you. Like Caine, you've been given great power to redeem yourself. You've been given a chance to show that we are not simply monsters or animals, but guides, both among Kindred and Kine. Just in the few months since you've been in this city, you've felt your control of your blood increase by leaps and bounds, haven't you? Use that to your advantage, as well as your inborn-ability to build influences. The others may neither trust nor respect you; but you do have the ability to achieve both.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I would say that God has not merely forgiven you, he has blessed you with the power to redeem yourself. Your humanity did not end with your Embrace. You were simply made part of a long heritage where you have the capacity for great acts, good and evil.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Now then, Crowley, I find preaching to be an exhausting process. Hopefully, you've taken something from this that will help you down the tunnel. The next time I’m called upon, it had better be because of some new developments, and not simply more moping over the same tired issues. If so, I'll be there. If not, I doubt you'll survive long enough to regret it.&quot;<br>
And he was gone.<br>
<br>
At this point, Crowley realized he had been driving in circles. <br>
<br>
He returned to his haven and thought about what Roche had said. <br>
<br>
He closed his eyes, and saw the tunnel. He saw the light; so promising, so rewarding. But still out of reach. <br>
<br>
But closer.... closer....<br>
<br>
