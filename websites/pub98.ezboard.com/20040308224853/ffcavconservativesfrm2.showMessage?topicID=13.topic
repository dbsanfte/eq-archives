I even have a hard time accepting that there is such a thing as a group of &quot;Conservative values&quot;.  What is conservative for one is not for another (I'll post a separate topic to discuss drug prohibition in particular).<br>
<br>
To complicate things even further, my European friend characterizes Conservatives as &quot;Liberals&quot;, because in Europe the word &quot;liberal&quot; refers to Classical Liberalism, the core precepts of Western Liberal thought, namely:  every person deserves to live free, be treated equally by his/her gov't and by his/her community, to own and enjoy the fruits of his/her labor.  I am a conservative, but I certainly believe in those precepts.<br>
<br>
Those who we in America call &quot;liberals&quot; (who Reagan called liberals) are really socialists.  Why don't we call them that?  Well, that's another debate.<br>
<br>
No, I have an even more fundamental problem with the notion that there are two polar opposites:  right and left, as they are usually called.  I think that in most cases, people use these terms of convenience to pigeonhole their intellectal opponents, as in &quot;Oh, he's a leftist&quot;, or &quot;She's farther right than Atilla the Hun&quot; (as if!  as if Conservatives would support a marauding dictator!  Most dictators have been socialists, anyway: Mao, Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, Tito, Ceaucescu, Castro, just to name a few.  Those who are not socialists are by no means Conservatives in the American sense of the word).<br>
<br>
The emphasis we hear from our politicians today on right vs. left (or Republican vs. Democrats) has caused a marked and harmful partisan split in our people.  It's not a good thing.  There are many cases where we need to pull together as a nation (defense against terrorism is a prime example, boosting the economy is another).  It is not in our community interest to think of ourselves as being split into two sides, and then to grapple for control (so that, as Jonah Goldberg puts it, 51% of the population can pee in the cornflakes of the other 49%).<br>
<br>
But also, one can be Conservative and support legal abortion rights.  Or one can be Conservative and still support the legalization of drugs.  Or one can support civil rights and protection of civil liberties -- and still be a Conservative (sometimes this divergence is categorized as being &quot;socially liberal&quot; and &quot;fiscally conservative&quot;).<br>
<br>
So, although I accept the &quot;right vs. left&quot; labels as a kind of shorthand that lets us avoid long-winded explanations such as I have just written, I still think we would do better to keep an open mind and use more precise language that describes our feelings on each particular issue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives.showUserPublicProfile?gid=therightguyatfcav>The Right Guy at FCAV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/27/03 10:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &quot;right vs. left&quot; -- is this a helpful metaphor</span><hr size=1> Hi milkchaser,<br>
<br>
Right vs left has more to do with what side of the aisle our political leaders are on when in session. But over time it has become ideological in nature.<br>
<br>
I don't know if it's helpful to use this metaphor, but personally it seems a minor point. My personal feeling is this.... there is a struggle going on in our own country (and of course the world), and our president said it very clearly when he said it's a struggle between good and evil. This is not a ultra-right position I'm taking, it's just thinking through the situation we are in, and finding no better way to describe it.<br>
<br>
I firmly beleive in God and Country, and I beleive in the vast majority of issues that would be considered Conservative. Debating whether or not the Left vs Right metaphor is helpful seems to me to be a waste of time. We desperately need to get back to TRADITIONAL VALUES in this country, and we need to focus on this immediately.<br>
<br>
I'm in agreement that Conservatives can be a diverse group, but the basics stay the same. And I have no problem with the 2 party system. However, I wish the 2 parties would debate and discuss Conservative ideas instead of some of the Liberal/Socialist crap they waste time and money on.<br>
<br>
One last item... I am totally against legalizing drugs! Don't you think we have enough substance abuse in this country?<br>

Then, the extreme left and the extreme right meet at the &quot;bottom&quot; of the circle, where they resemble one another. Hence National(ist) Socialism [Nazism], all the way 'round' to the right, resembles (Soviet) Socialism) [Communism], all the way 'round' to the left, in its total control of society, which, of course, includes the economy.<br>
Halfway between the &quot;center&quot; and the &quot;bottom&quot;, on the right (at &quot;90°&quot;), can be found &quot;anarcho-libertarians&quot;, who believe in a social life free of restriction by government.<br>
Halfway between the &quot;center&quot; and the &quot;bottom&quot;, on the left (at &quot;270°&quot;), can be found the &quot;anarcho-syndicalists&quot; [at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/sp001530.html">www.spunk.org/library/int...01530.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->]   I found this definition: &quot;...Anarcho-Syndicalism can be defined as 'the strategy of advancing the Anarchist project through building a leaderless mass movement of wage-workers using direct action to take control of the workplace away from the bosses...'&quot;, indicating that anarcho-syndicalism appears to be an economic style of libertarianism.<br>
I personally think that the spectrum varies from freedom, on the right, towards equality on the left. However, (and correct me if I'm wrong) equality doesn't seem to imply any responsibility... &quot;Where all the same&quot;, it says, &quot;So we owe each other nothing but economic support.&quot;<br>
Freedom, to be separate from anarchy, requires law, hence values, as Dave emphasizes above.<br>

<br>
Well, thanks for reading what I had to say, nonetheless.  You may not think it is important, but let me say why I do.  I believe that a fundamental step before people can work together toward a goal is for them to understand the central ideas that they share.  <br>
<br>
I do not think labeling people as right or left is a useful way of viewing a complicated world, nor do I think it is an effective approach to persuading most people (as most people are well aware that life is more than a little complex and simple formulations don't usually pan out).  Moreover, if we want to work together, we cannot start by requiring that everybody conform to a particular view on all subjects.<br>
<br>

<br>
However, I do not think the President was referring to either the right's struggle against the left, nor Republicans' struggle to solidify their control in Washington, nor to a struggle between traditional values vs. relativist thinking.  I think he was clearly and narrowly referring to the struggle of modern Democratic nations against terrorists and rogue nations.<br>
<br>

<br>
This illustrates my point exactly.  I do not believe in God.  In fact, I believe there is no God.  Does this mean I cannot be a Conservative?  If you and I could potentially work together to keep babies from being aborted or to lower taxes, would you refuse because my &quot;values&quot; are not traditional?  If we both agree that the Federal Gov't is too big and too expensive, that free markets are better than protectionism, would you shun me because of the issues upon which we disagree?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm in agreement that Conservatives can be a diverse group, but the basics stay the same.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
And what would those basics be?  What are these &quot;traditional values&quot; that seem, to you, to be imperiled these days?  I am glad to see that you accept those who disagree with you and are willing to tolerate diversity of opinion.  So what are the core values that you think Conservatives believe?  I stated what I think they are in the second paragraph of my original post, here they are again:<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the core precepts of Western Liberal thought, namely: every person deserves to live free, be treated equally by his/her gov't and by his/her community, to own and enjoy the fruits of his/her labor.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>One last item... I am totally against legalizing drugs! Don't you think we have enough substance abuse in this country?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A few points:<br>
1.  Drug prohibition has not stopped drug use.<br>
2.  Not all drug use is substance abuse, any more than all drinking is drunkenness.<br>
3.  Driving your car is riskier than smoking marijuana.  Driving your car over the speed limit is risky not only to you yourself, but to others as well.  In contrast, smoking marijuana is neglibly harmful and then only to the smoker, and yet, speeding will get you a traffic ticket and marijuana posession will get you a trip to jail.  This makes no sense.<br>
4.  There is nothing inherently wrong with intoxicating yourself.  Why is one form of intoxication considered evil while another, more dangerous form, is perfectly legal.<br>
5.  George Washington grew marijuana.  He even separated his male plants from the females, an indication that he was trying to increase the potency when smoked.<br>
6.  Our country was formed to preserve the right of the individual to live his life as he sees fit, not to enable those in the majority to use the State to impose their values upon the rest of the population.  There are a number of safeguards in the Federal Constitution, for example, that preserve minority rights (and here I do not mean racial minority).<br>

Well, I will confess that your two-dimensional model of political thought is more helpful than the single-dimensioned &quot;right/left&quot; dichotomy.  Three of those political quizzes tried to graph political thought in two dimensions, and one of them just repeated the old, tired right vs. left model with politicians ranked from Jesse Jackson on the left through Kennedy, Hillary, Bill Clinton on the left to Ronald Reagan as the farthest to the right.<br>
<br>
Again, I just think these labels are neither accurate nor helpful because there are way more than even two dimensions.  I think we get ourselves in trouble when we start thinking of those Americans who either disagree with us on some issue or who belong to a different political party as our enemies somehow.<br>
<br>
Moreover, I think that there are unifying principles that justify a Conservative to be pro-choice on abortion, against drug prohibition, for more freedom for gays, while at the same time supporting free markets; smaller, less expensive and more responsive government; lower taxes; limited Federal gov't power (returning such power to the States and to the people), etc.  The world would not go to hell in a handbasket if we did our preaching from the pulpits and not from the well of the Congress.  If we want to bring about a more moral world, we should do it one person at a time, changing one heart at a time.  But it certainly cannot be done through legislation.<br>
<br>
You also state that there is a trade-off between liberty and equality.  I do not see how or why this is.  For example, let us suppose that we passed laws legalizing drugs and gay marriage.  I think this is the right thing, by the way, because Liberty is a core Conservative value.  If we granted these liberties to the minority of the population who choose to exercise them, how would this impact the equality of the rest of us?<br>
<br>
Now, it is true that our Constitution guarantees equal justice under the law and this has been construed, for example, to limit the freedom of the States to draw arbitrary borders for Congressional districts.  However, the right to vote and the freedom to voice one's opinion in those elections remains intact. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milkchaser>milkchaser</A> at: 12/29/03 7:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives.showUserPublicProfile?gid=therightguyatfcav>The Right Guy at FCAV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/29/03 8:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &quot;right vs. left&quot; -- is this a helpful metaphor</span><hr size=1> It is obvious that we have different ideas of what Conservativism is (please no Clinton joke about the word &quot;is&quot;).<br>
<br>
Personally, I would not consider you a Conservative. I would consider you more of a Centrist Liberal. I am not knocking you, this is just an observation. There is more to being a Conservative than freedom and economic responsibility. This country was born out of wanting the freedom to practice religion freely and openly, without interference from the Government. The prevailing religion at the time of our founding was Christianity. Yes, I know people will argue that it was other religions, but Christianity was #1. Today, the vast majority of Christians consider themselves Conservative. Considering you do not beleive in God is it would be hard for me to consider you a Conservative. <br>
<br>
You mention that you have a problem with labeling people. This is another reason why I would not consider you a Conservative. Most Conservatives I know are willing to freely call a spade, a spade. Anotherwords, they call it like they see it, and labels are a useful way to get to the truth without having to spin everything. I for one have no problem whatsoever with labeling. Heck, it works at the Grocery store!<br>
<br>
The President was probably talking about the global situation, but I would bet heavily that he would also use the term in private to explain what is going on this country. Remember, he considers himself a religious person, and he openly aknowledges God, and he is openly against Abortion because of his religious convictions. I will cede that I may have tied the two together, but I am still willing to wager.<br>

You also mention that the Government is too big and too expensive, and you make inference that I would agree. My take on this reads a little more like a Conservative. Sure the Government is too big, but it's all the Social programs that get approved that causes this. The Government being too expensive is twofold. One, we pay out huge amounts of $ for Social programs. Two, there is enormous waste and corruption. I don't pretend to know how big the Government should be, but we need a strong Gov in place for our own safety. However, I trust Conservatives making these decisions much more than I trust Liberals.

Drug use usually leads to abuse, just like Alcohol.<br>
Get caught driving fast with Alcohol can have the same effect, jailtime.<br>

The bottom line for me is this... If we as Conservatives are going to change things for the better, worrying about labels seems to be a waste of valuable time. I don't see how the label Left or Right hurts nor helps, it just is!<br>

I believe very strongly that you should be allowed to practice your religion.  And that same belief animates my sense of freedom to NOT believe in God.

For example, although he has said that he is personally against abortion, he does not intend to outlaw abortion.  He has said that we have to change how people feel in their hearts.  This is the approach Jesus took as well. Jesus was no Pharisee (although, you seem to be a candidate, in my opinion).<br>

I agree that the primary duty of the gov't is to protect the people and that for the Federal gov't this means things like defense and intelligence and law enforcement.  But I disagree that your take is more Conservative.<br>
<br>
As for how big the gov't should be, there a number of ways to measure this.  A common way is to compare the tax burden to the Gross Domestic Product (which is a measure of how big and healthy the economy is).  Right now, we are spending about as much as a percentage of GDP as was spent at the height of WW II.  Only, we're not spending as much on defense -- rather, we're spending it on pork projects.  These are not social programs (although, more than half the budget is Social Security, but that's another story -- I presume that we both agree that Social Security should be reformed so that we put our tax money into private accounts).  What I would like to see cut are the pork projects.  I would go into more detail but I don't think you're a &quot;detail&quot; kind of guy. <br>

Just because I see things clearly and don't see the value of debating every single point you attack me. That's ok, I can take it. I am most definately different from you, and I will share what I consider the biggest differences between folks like you and folks like me. <br>
<br>
I am a doer! Taking a problem and nitpicking it to death is wasted time. I prefer to take action. You on the other hand, want to prove how educated you are, and think you have all the right answers. So you use debate as a tactic of showing your superiority.<br>

The name calling I don't get; that is a leftist tactic, not often seen in conservatives. Leftist intellectuals do it all the time. When confounded by someone they think is beneath their intelligence level.<br>

Simple debate is fine, but once you get bogged down in details of the debate you come away feeling as if you could have spent that time more wisely. I freely admit that I am not an intellectual, just an average American concerned by what I see as a rush towards Liberalism/Socialism in our country.<br>

This is what liberals do!  They take an argument that they are losing, and turn it into a spinfest.  Keep it up Dave, some of us agree with you 99%.  I think you are wrong on the whole alcohol thing.  I drink beer several times a week.  I never get drunk, and I never ever drive after drinking.  I believe there is nothing wrong with a beer now and then.  <br>

I guess I gave the wrong impression with the Alcohol statement. I too enjoy drinking a couple of beers. My comment was more towards the abuse end of drinking than the occasional drinking. Abuse is abuse, no matter what the substance. And abuse has to start somewhere, so by making a plethora of illicit drugs easy to get makes it that much easier to get started. Folks that get addicted start as a casual users. The weak then fall prey to abuse. Sure we spend alot of tax dollars to try and stem the flow of drugs, but I personnally feel as if it's a necessary evil. <br>
<br>
Something that never seems to come up when talking about legalization of drugs is the following....<br>
Run through your mind how many countrys and opposing ideologies would love to see the United States have a populace that is addicted to something and have this country go down the toilet. The list can be a long one. As the world leader in about darn near everything, we must stay clearheaded, strong, and determined.<br>

This thread and the reactions to Milkchaser's views perfectly illustrate such a need.<br>
<br>
Milkchaser would likely fall into a group I would label &quot;constitutional conservatives&quot;, whereas TheRightGuy et al could best be described as &quot;Christian conservatives&quot;.<br>
<br>
MC's views and apparent philosophy falls upon the letter of what is in the Constitution and the writings of the founding fathers. TRG follows more what he perceives as the &quot;spirit&quot; of the founding fathers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Conservatism&quot;, or at least the political organization, came to the forefront in the early 60s to unite religious conservatives and constitutional conservatives against the common foe of Communism and collectivism in general. However, with Communism's death, there really seems to be little holding the two groups together. The Conservative Party's principles were listed as:<br>
...........<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That foremost among the transcendent values is the individual's use of his God-given free will, whence derives his right to be free from the restrictions of arbitrary force; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That liberty is indivisible, and that political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That the purpose of government is to protect those freedoms through the preservation of internal order, the provision of national defense, and the administration of justice; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That when government ventures beyond these rightful functions, it accumulates power, which tends to diminish order and liberty; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That the Constitution of the United States is the best arrangement yet devised for empowering government to fulfill its proper role, while restraining it from the concentration and abuse of power; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That the genius of the Constitution- the division of powers- is summed up in the clause that reserves primacy to the several states, or to the people, in those spheres not specifically delegated to the Federal government; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That the market economy, allocating resources by the free play of supply and demand, is the single economic system compatible with the requirements of personal freedom and constitutional government, and that it is at the same time the most productive supplier of human needs; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That when government interferes with the work of the market economy, it tends to reduce the moral and physical strength of the nation; that when it takes from one man to bestow on another, it diminishes the incentive of the first, the integrity of the second, and the moral autonomy of both; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That we will be free only so long as the national sovereignty of the United States is secure; that history shows periods of freedom are rare, and can exist only when free citizens concertedly defend their rights against all enemies; <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That the forces of international Communism are, at present, the greatest single threat to these liberties; <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That the United States should stress victory over, rather than coexistence with, this menace; and <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That American foreign policy must be judged by this criterion: does it serve the just interests of the United States? <br>
<br>
So, aside from the acknowledgment that our free-will is God given, the &quot;official&quot; Conservative viewpoint makes no mention of a religious component. Rather, the need to preserve the Constitution AS WRITTEN, as well as the belief that a minimally restricted free market economy is essential to individual Liberty are what makes a Conservative. No dependence upon a Christian God within Government has ever been a consideration of true Conservatives. <br>
<br>
So, while I couldn't care less who actually OWNS a particular label, I think it is important that we all realize that Milkchaser's view of &quot;conservatism&quot; closely follows the tenets of the actual Conservative Party. I think it would be much better for the Conservative movement as a whole for the two groups to agree to a certain &quot;conservative&quot; orientation, but then differentiate themselves as &quot;Christian conservatives&quot; and something along the lines of &quot;Free&quot; or &quot;Constitutional&quot; conservatives. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milkchaser>milkchaser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/8/04 12:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &quot;right vs. left&quot; -- is this a helpful metaphor</span><hr size=1> Yes, I am a Libertarian (and I don't think that it's very kind to call people trolls just because you disagree with them).<br>
<br>
Libertarians are usually disgruntled republicans who wish that our gov't would return to original Constitutional principles of limited gov't and federalism.<br>
<br>
Had Libertarians voted for the Republican candidates in past elections, Bush/Gore in Florida wouldn't have been a nail-biter, NV, WA &amp; SD would all have Republican Senators and the Senate wouldn't have switched to the Democrats in 2000 (and thus Jeffords probably wouldn't have jumped ship).  This is because the margin of victory for Democrats in those races was less than the number of votes for the Libertarian candidates.<br>
<br>
So if Republicans would do more to satisfy Libertarian concerns, they would win more elections...even the close ones.<br>

<br>
For instance, you tried to 'illustrate the &quot;trade-off&quot; between liberty and equality: legalizing gay marriage'.  However, your example shows how granting gays liberty to marriage would result in granting them equality as well.  That's not a trade-off.  Gays gain liberty and gain equality.<br>
<br>
A trade-off, on the other hand, is when I give up one thing in order to gain something else.  I give up talking to my wife over breakfast, but I gain the opportunity to advance a political discussion, for example (which is what I'm doing now).<br>

I suggest that liberty and equality are independent of each other.  You can advance liberty and increase equality at the same time.  For example, when women were given the right to vote, we increased their freedom (allowing them to enter the polling place, participate in elections, run for office or stay home as before -- do as they chose to do), but we also made them equal to male citizens.<br>

This is what logicians call a tautology.  It's like saying that Al Gore lost the election because he didn't win.<br>
<br>
I feel confident that you have a point, but what is it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What [gays] want is treatment as &quot;next of kin&quot;; inclusion in medical plans, as 'spouses' or 'family'; and the right to be beneficiaries of salary protection plans, and other life insurance policies. Is this not a quest for &quot;equal treatment&quot;?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, and it also makes them more free.  Again, you have cited an instance where freedom and equality go hand in hand.  I hope you are open to my point that there is not always a trade-off between these two.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Even the campaign for legalization of marijuana is an attempt to decriminalize the use of an obvious &quot;gateway&quot; drug, and at the same time, an attempt to remove the stigma of drug use from the people who use drugs. This, too, is an attempt at equality.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
And here you seem to be going off-topic and the wheels really come off your argument.  Legalizing marijuana clearly increases freedom -- the freedom of marijuana smokers to do what they want (not a bad idea, given that it is not all that harmful -- if you were to try it you would see that for yourself).  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>And</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> legalizing pot would afford pot smokers equal treatment with tobacco smokers (which is much more likely a gateway drug) and alcohol drinkers (which is provably more lethal, and more dangerous to others considering that the effects of a drunk driver are incredibly worse than the effects of a potsmoking driver -- alcohol tends to reduce inhibitions and pot tends to increase them, thus drunks drive fast and sloppy and stoned drivers are slow and careful).<br>
<br>
So, legalizing pot would increase both liberty and equality.  This is not a trade-off.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't want to suggest that because you're wrong on the issue of liberty/equality trade-off, you are necessarily wrong on the pot legalization issue.  These are two different topics.  I like to keep them straight, even if you neglect to do so.<br>
<br>
I do think you are wrong on the pot legalization issue.  Since you think that pot is a gateway drug, I suspect you don't know much about pot.  It's a gateway to chocolate eating, I suppose, and potato chip consumption (pot tends to make its users hungry for carbohydrates).  But there is a strong or stronger correlation between past chocolate consumption and future heroin consumption than past pot consumption (ie. ~100% of heroin users are past chocolate users).  What does this prove?  Nothing.  The same goes for correlation between pot and heroin.  Many pot smokers have not, will not do heroin.  To suggest a connection is irrational.<br>
<br>
As for removing the stigma of drug use, this is only bad if there is something bad about using drugs.  If it turned out that smoking pot made you live longer (I'm purposely being absurd), then it would be wrong to maintain the stigma, right?<br>
<br>
In fact, most pot smokers are otherwise law abiding.  They would not be criminals if not for the prohibition of their favorite intoxicant.  If they smoke pot and do no harm to others, if you cannot even tell whether they use drugs without conducting chemical tests on their urine, then what possible ill effects can they be causing society?<br>
<br>
Listen, we conservatives are not given a blank check to be irrational.  We should still try to run the country with our brains and not our emotions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fd10801>fd10801</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/22/04 4:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Left vs. Right</span><hr size=1> I'm inclined to agree with you that I have not successfully demonstrated that an &quot;increase&quot; in liberty would lead to a &quot;decrease&quot; in equality, or vice versa.<br>
So I will leave the field, bloodied but unbowed, in that area.<br>
However, you couldn't be more wrong in assuming that I think marijuana is a gateway drug, and that I overestimate the damage it can do, because I've never tried it.<br>
Actually, although my personal life shouldn't enter into the argument, I'll tell you that I smoked pot almost every single day for twenty years. I also drank almost every kind of alcoholic beverage known to man, in over a dozen countries, and several dozen states.<br>
I've done nearly every kind of pain killer, barbituate, amphetamine derivative and hallucinogen.<br>
I've done cocaine in both the nasal and smokable forms.<br>
If I tell you marijuana is a gateway drug, it's because I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>know</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it to be so.<br>
It's so easy for people who are pro-legalization to say, &quot;You don't know anything about drugs, because you've never tried them,&quot; that they soon come to believe that it's a meaningful argument. It isn't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milkchaser>milkchaser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/22/04 4:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Left vs. Right</span><hr size=1> I'm sorry for assuming that you had never tried pot.  Still, how can you blame pot?  Pot didn't make you try all of those drugs.  Did it?  Did the reefer twist your arm?<br>
<br>
I do believe that our experience informs our beliefs.  It is ridiculous to assert otherwise.  However, we err when we try to extrapolate from our personal experience to others.<br>
<br>
Since you do have so much experience with various drugs, you should be in a good position to explain why pot needs to be illegal when alcohol and tobacco do not.  Most drinkers and smokers are responsible, as are most pot smokers.  Most do not become addicted, nor let these substances control their lives. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showMessageRange?topicID=13.topic&start=21&stop=21>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=13.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=13.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.threadControl?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub98.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fcavconservativesfrm2">General Conservative Discussion<option value="fcavconservativesfrm7">Townhall Meetup Talk<option value="fcavconservativesfrm8">Soldiers Appreciation Forum.<option value="fcavconservativesfrm12">Presidential Race 2004<option value="fcavconservativesfrm11">Member Articles...Top Notch Musings<option value="fcavconservativesfrm10">Investment ideas for Conservatives<option value="fcavconservativesfrm13">Links and Conservative Vendors<option value="fcavconservativesfrm3">Polls<option value="fcavconservativesfrm9">Liberal or Political Jokes.<option value="fcavconservativesfrm1">Announcements<option value="fcavconservativesfrm4">Administration Discussion<option value="fcavconservativesfrm5">Help Files</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bfcavconservatives>FCAV Conservatives</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/ffcavconservativesfrm2>General Conservative Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://www.geocities.com/the_right_turn2003">FCAV</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31b<br>Copyright ©1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
