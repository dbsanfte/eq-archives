She turned her attention to Dust and stood up, &quot;Dust, this is my bro, don't worry bout it.&quot;<br>
Zil's eyes scanned the room to where Hotaru could have gone.  Her eyes found the back door.  <br>
She turned to her brother, &quot;Get your information from him, but don't you go having all the fun without me.&quot;  She turned back to Dust, &quot;You can stay if you wish.  Just be careful.  I'll be back in a bit.&quot;<br>
Zil headed through the crowds and out the back door.  She had to warn her friend.  These scientists knew some angry escapees would just love to track them down and make them pay, so security would probably become an issue.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2F2F4F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub98.ezboard.com/bcollisionworld.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurairyu0>KuraiRyu 0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#F5F5DC>(6/14/03 10:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub98.ezboard.com/fcollisionworldfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Target Acquired</span><hr size=1> Nina seemed to have no destination as of yet, so he let himself wander about, scouting out his surroundings, making sure he knew the place well incase anything happened. <br>

After following Nina in three consecutive circles, Ryu must have given up and gone on a most distinctive path. Nina herself caught a glimpse of a provoked Zil stalking across the campus.

Zil took a deep breath, aware that Hotaru may not be able to hear her over the clamor of the drunken college students, and zil called to her friend &quot;Watch your back.  things may get interesting!&quot;<br>
Deciding not to stick around to explain, Zil turned back to the party to search for the scientist's son.  Revenge would be hers...<br>
