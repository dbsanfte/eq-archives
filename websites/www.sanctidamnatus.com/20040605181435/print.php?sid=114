<font class="print-normal">I can only conclude he is drunk or stoned. After reading the speech President Bush gave on Monday (see <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/05/20040524-10.html" target="_blank">www.whitehouse.gov</a>) one can see how Mr. Bush has no concept of how he fits into history. <br>
<br>
Forget that such a speech is about six months too late, or that there was no details given as to how any of the proposed goals will be achieved. Let’s not even discuss the issues of the U.S.’s new plan to incorporate the very militias we have been fighting into the new Iraqi army and police force. These are all issue that bother just about everyone.<br>
<br>
What baffles me is how Mr. Bush can continue to grasp at the straws of “weapons of mass destruction” (which really applies to N. Korea and various other states), deposing tyrannical rule, and the “war on terror” and even bring democracy as causes for this war. I am still not sure how our government was duped into going along with invading a foreign country in the first place. His speech spoke not at all about his actions, or his cabinet’s actions in this whole affair. Instead we are supposed to believe “this is the world as we find it” and that “we did not seek this war on terror.” <br>
<br>
So we didn’t invade a country which had no known connection to terror since 1994? A country that attempted to comply with rather harsh investigations and sanctions and still attempt to keep some show of dignity? In the face of contrary evidence the Bush administration continues to maintain their reasons for going to war against a very poorly armed nation. And then “some of Saddam's elite guards shed their uniforms and melted into the civilian population.” What did Mr. Bush and Co. expect? What invasion ever did not face some sort of a guerilla insurgency?  Is the president completely delusional? Does it make sense for use to cry foul when others don’t play by our rules? <br>
<br>
“They hope to wear out the patience of Americans.” Forget them, how about you Mr. Bush? You are wearing out my patience pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
“All along, some have questioned whether the Iraqi people are ready for self-government, or even want it.” Well I suspect they do. Is this something that needed reiterating? Did anyone actually have to ask if they wanted self rule? The best part is we are still not giving it to them. We have declared that we will turn over Iraq to its own devices with advisories of various governments but we have yet to even begin gathering these advisors. We certainly won’t actually go and ask for advice. And we are still forcing the Iraqi authorities to report to us. We are not even removing any troops. What kind of pull out is this? <br>
<br>
It isn’t one. We are lying to everyone. And no one is fooled, unless you’re an American citizen. In that case you probably didn’t even see, hear or read the speech, because you were watching American Idol or even worse were absorbed by “The Swan” – a TV show about low self esteem women who get plastic surgery and compete in a beauty pageant after.<br>
<br>
Maybe I should be happy no one saw this.<br>
