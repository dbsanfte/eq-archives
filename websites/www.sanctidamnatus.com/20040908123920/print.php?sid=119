<font class="print-normal">I too got a nice suntan yesterday at the large rally held here in New York.<br>
<br>
I have to say I believe the estimate of 400,000 people may even be a bit low. Basically Seventh avenue was jammed, and the police stopped keeping the sidewalks blocked off. The end of the protest had not even gotten started when the beginning had reached and filled the designated end zone. Sixth avenue was crowded with left over people as was the east side where the protest ended. Interestingly most people I met were from New York. There were plenty of visitors but large part of the crowd seemed to be local.<br>
<br>
I myself went with a large group up to Central Park where the courts said there would be no gathering. I did not see many police there, and they were perfectly happy to let people get some sun and chant, etc. I left the park about 6 pm. <br>
<br>
Overall, the Police and the crowd were pretty respectful of each other, except for a couple incidents. Strangely the police put down the gay kiss-in. I don't know what they had a problem with except 42nd street is such a tourist spot that they may have been afraid of offending tourists. I did hear that later on there were some conflicts between protesters and people arriving for the convention. Most incidents worked themselves out and the police seemed very aggressive about keeping people moving.<br>
<br>
One incident I didn't see but was getting text messaged about was a group called Black Block Party (an anarchist group) had set a paper mache dragon on fire in front of MSG blocking the street - I did see the dragon early on, it was HUGE. The fire was out before the fire department could even get there. But many people were pissed they blocked the progress of things. I am sure the news will play it up. From what I am reading after the fact the dragon actually belonged to another group.<br>
<br>
I did see two conflicts but amazingly both were republicans who got aggressive with protesters. The police arrested all involved but then really handled the aftermath poorly and let things get more tense than was necessary. Of course these eventually blew over and people generally had fun, didn't want any trouble and were there to express themselves.<br>
<br>
The media coverage was almost entirely foreign.<br /><br />
