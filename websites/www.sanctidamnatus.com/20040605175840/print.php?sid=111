<font class="print-normal"><p>Condoleezza Rice finally made it before the commission (you can read the transcript at <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61252-2004Apr8.html" target="_blank">www.washingtonpost.com</a>). Her appearance alone was a victory for those calling for more information, as President Bush had been badgered into allowing her to speak publicly and on the record. In a excellent performance, Ms. Rice answered and argued her case with great calm and poise. With few exceptions the panel recognized her achievements and got down to business quickly, possibly to ensure they could stay with the ten minutes each had.<br>
<p>Unfortunately Ms. Rice may not have any real new information at all. In one statement she went so far as to say that the attack on the World Trade Center could not have been avoided. She cited the Millennium incident in which bomb making materials were “luckily” found on the Canadian border; cause an alert to go up. Ms. Rice did however make it clear that the government was not prepared for this and could not have been given the 233 days the Bush administration was in office and the nature of democratic societies. The key, according to Ms. Rice, was that the Bush administration inherited the terrorism situation as it stood and did not have the time to ramp up to a higher alertness.<br>
<p>While this might seem rather convincing, it has been argued that the Bush administration has decreased spending for homeland security as ti is now called. Combine this with the fact that the Department of Homeland Security is a complete shambles from which no form of intelligence could ever be gotten and a bleak picture emerges. Still unanswered is the Iraq connection. Why did we invade Iraq if after all this time the President has finally admitted that there was no connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda? In fact there is evidence that suggests the only Al Qaeda relationship with Iraq may have been via a northern camp which was working with Kurds. These are the same Kurds we abandoned after the first Iraqi war and then assisted and used in the Second Iraqi War. <br>
<p>We seem to forget that Osama Bin Laden was prepared to defend Saudi Arabia against possible invasion from the secular Iraq invasion after Iraq had moved on Kuwait. It is the sudden appearance of American troops in the Kingdom of the Two Mosques that caused such issues for the Taliban, many with Saudi Arabia and Mr. Bin Laden. Why would Al Qaeda work with Saddam Hussein, a person considered to be a great enemy to Islam by the Al Qaeda? The Al Qaeda camp in Northern Iraq was likely assisting insurgence.<br>
<p>Questions still unanswered: <br>
<li>What was contained in the August 5th 2001 directive that the President chose to ignore. Many have said that there is information in this still classified document regarding strange goings on at flight schools in Florida, involving various Saudi nationals.<br>
<li>Why did the President push for a connection between September 11th and Iraq? Why did he pursue Iraq as a terrorist nation when there was no evidence (and not for a lack of looking) to show that Iraq had any connection with Terrorism after 1994? What was to be gained by this?<br>
<li>How is it possible to have a tax cut, hundreds of billions spent on a war and not lose any effectiveness on the home front? It isn’t. Where is this money coming from and who si going to foot the obviously large bill when it comes due?<br>
<p>And these are the obvious questions!<br>
