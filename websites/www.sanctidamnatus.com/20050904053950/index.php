    So I was doing a little research on Pat Robertson, seeing as he has called for a &quot;hit&quot; on all that he sees as evil. I don't want to get on his bad side, so I figured if I knew him better I could please him and not have to deal with the Krazy Kristian Koalition (thats KKK for the slow of reading) coming after me!<br>
<br>
Some basic facts:<br>
<br>
* Pat was born on March 22, 1930, in Lexington, Virginia.<br>
* Pat went to Washington and Lee University - I was accepted there and almost went. Pat and I could have hung out in the Alumni Lounge together!<br>
* Pat did his duty to country by joining the Marines in 1950. He served in Korea and was made a lieutenant in 1952.<br>
* Pat has a law degree from Yale (juris doctor degree 1955) and a Master of Divinity from NY Theological. Pat has never passed the Bar exam (failed three times).<br>
* Pat is not his real name. His name is M.G. Robertson. Marion Gordon is what his mom named him. I wonder how he got Pat from that?<br>
* Pat claims shared ancestory with Winston Churchill. &quot;We are not afraid.&quot; Pat's Father spent 34 years in the House of Representatives and Senate. I assume he was not the janitor, nor imprisoned within.<br>
* Pat formed the Family Channel out of charity donations to CBN (Christian Broadcasting network) which was a non-profit organization that supported his 700 Club. The Family Channel started turning a profit (the ad space sold well?) so Pat sold the Family Channel to himself and his son for..well...almost nothing. A few years later they sold the &quot;Family Channel&quot; to the anti-christ known as Rupert Murdock for about 180 million dollars. Pat's current personal net worth is in the 150 million range.<br>
* Pat lives in Virginia and has his own airstrip, a diamond mine and owns the Icecapades. Of course all this was paid for by CBN (remember a non-profit organization devoted to promote the gospel). CBN somehow always seems to turn a profit for &quot;Pat&quot; Robertson.<br>
* Pat has had occasional trouble with the law due to several pyramid schemes such as American Benefits Plus. Seems the Pyramid scheme was close to collapse (even though Pat said the bible supported the scheme) and he changed the company name to Kalo Vista and sold vitamins instead.<br>
* Pat has had soem very shady dealings with various brutal dictators in order to make money in the ventures like tha diamond mine mentioned above<br>
<br>
Well enough bio, I don't think this gives us a full view of Pat Robertson, so I checked out his web site and found this goodie - <a href="http://www.cbn.com/communitypublic/pancakes.asp" target="_new">Pat's Age defying Pancakes</a>. Now this man has something there!<br>
<br>
So lets see what he has said to us, the public....<br>
<br>
------<br>
20 Jun 1990: On his television show The 700 Club: &quot;Many observers say that AIDS is the hammer and gun of the homosexual movement, an effective vehicle to propel the homosexual agenda throughout every phase of our society.&quot;<br>
<br>
If anyone knows what exactly he means - or even how such a thing works, please let me know. Maybe Rush Limbaugh writes copy for him? <br>
<br>
No Wait! It has to be Pat Buchanan writing for him, because Pat B. said during an anti-gay rally in Des Moines: &quot;We're going to bring back God and the Bible and drive the gods of secular humanism right out of the public schools of America.&quot; This was in Febriuary of 1996. Believe it or not Pat B. was running for President at the time.<br>
<br>
------<br>
18 Jan 1995: On his television show The 700 Club: &quot;[Homosexuals] want to come into churches and disrupt church services and throw blood all around and try to give people AIDS and spit in the face of ministers.&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess they were getting AIDS just for this purpose? Sounds like some sort of Commie-pinko plot to me.<br>
<br>
------<br>
18 May 1999: On his television show The 700 Club: &quot;In Europe, the big word is tolerance. You tolerate everything. Homosexuals are riding high in the media. For example, in the Cayman Islands, which is a British colony or whatever they call it now -- it's an independent thing -- in order to establish full relationships with England, England is insisting that they recognize homosexuals and the Cayman Islands are saying: 'We're Christians and we'd rather not do it.' And in Scotland you can't believe how strong the homosexuals are. It's just simply unbelievable. And so as far as the vestiges of John Knox and some of these heroes, I don't think it exists any more. And what could happen? It could go right back to the darkness very easily.&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess the homosexuals in Scotland lift weights?<br>
<br>
------<br>
30 Dec 1981: On his television show The 700 Club: &quot;The Constitution of the United States, for instance, is a marvelous document for self-government by the Christian people. But the minute you turn the document into the hands of non-Christian people and atheistic people they can use it to destroy the very foundation of our society. And that's what's been happening.&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess ol' Tommy Jefferson had his head up his ass with the whole seperation of church and state thing. I guess only non Judeo-Christian churches should be separate from the Union. Then again he wore a wig...maybe he was Scottish and gay?<br>
<br>
------<br>
From Pat Robertson's Book &quot;New World Order&quot; (no kidding that is the name), page 218: &quot;When I said during my presidential bid that I would only bring Christians and Jews into the government, I hit a firestorm. `What do you mean?' the media challenged me. `You're not going to bring atheists into the government? How dare you maintain that those who believe in the Judeo Christian values are better qualified to govern America than Hindus and Muslims?' My simple answer is, `Yes, they are..'&quot;<br>
<br>
------<br>
April 1980: at the &quot;Washington for Jesus&quot; rally: &quot;We have enough votes to run the country. And when the people say, &quot;We've had enough,&quot; we are going to take over.&quot;<br>
<br>
There is something to be said about a man who has spent the last 25 years pushing this agenda, even though most people don't seem to much like his agenda. <br>
<br>
But I tend to think the public agenda is to feed his private agenda's bank account.<br>
<br>
------<br>
8 Jan 1992: On his television show The 700 Club: &quot;I know this is painful for the ladies to hear, but if you get married, you have accepted the headship of a man, your husband. Christ is the head of the household and the husband is the head of the wife, and that's the way it is, period.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let's see...replace Christ with Allah and it still works for the very Fundamental Muslim! You crafty dog, Pat, your good! I wonder if Pat knows that the Koran (spell it with a Q if you want) tells us that the Jews and Christians are brethren religions &quot;of the Book&quot; and as such, should be treated as misguided brothers? I doubt it, because Pat doesn't read the Quoran or the Koran, he is too busy being manly; pimping and beating his ladies.<br>
<br>
------<br>
Nov 1992: During an address of the American Center for Law and Justice: &quot;There is no such thing as separation of church and state in the Constitution. It is a lie of the Left and we are not going to take it anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well my Big Book of the Constitution sez: &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&quot; Thank the lord it was the first one I found in the Amendments! Well I guess that must have been a typo, and we are not going to take typos anymore! Let me get my Crayola crayon out and cross this mess out...<br>
<br>
Oh and FYI, from his web site: &quot;Robertson is founder and president of the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), a public interest law firm and education group that defends the First Amendment rights of people of faith. The law firm focuses on pro-family, pro-liberty and pro-life cases nationwide.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seems the First Amendment only applies if youre a &quot;Kristian&quot;. Otherwise keep your godless, heathen way out of the bible abiding government! Anyone remember the Religious Equality Amendment? <br>
<br>
------<br>
30 Dec 1982: On his television show The 700 Club: &quot;The Constitution of the United States, for instance, is a marvelous document for self-government by the Christian people. But the minute you turn the document into the hands of non-Christian people and Atheistic people they can use it to destroy the very foundation of our society. And that's what's been happening.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah and we should watch out for those crazy &quot;fudies&quot; while we are at it, because they might try twisting the document to their nefrious christian ends...oh wait...<br>
<br>
------<br>
August 2005: On his television show The 700 Club: Regarding Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, &quot;If he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it. It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war. We have the ability to take him out, and I think the time has come that we exercise that ability. We don't need another $200 billion war to get rid of one strong-arm dictator. It's a whole lot easier to have some of the covert operatives do the job and then get it over with.&quot; <br>
<br>
I wonder how much Robertson is paying for this job. Maybe I can retire!<br>
<br>
WAIT! Does Pat know about a war we are going to start with Venezuela? I gues being GWB's bestest buddy has paid off for Pat!<br>
<br>
<br>
------<br>
Finally, a little blurb form the 700 Club broadcast the week after 9/11:<br>
<br>
Falwell: &quot;What we saw on Tuesday, as terrible as it is, could be miniscule if, in fact, God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve.&quot;<br>
<br>
Robertson:  &quot;Well, Jerry, that's my feeling. I think we've just seen the antechamber to terror, we haven't begun to see what they can do to the major population.&quot;<br>
<br>
Falwell: &quot;The ACLU has got to take a lot of blame for this. And I know I'll hear from them for this, but throwing God...successfully with the help of the federal court system...throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools, the abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked and when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad...I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way, all of them who try to secularize America...I point the thing in their face and say you helped this happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Robertson: &quot;I totally concur, and the problem is we've adopted that agenda at the highest levels of our government, and so we're responsible as a free society for what the top people do, and the top people, of course, is the court system.&quot;<br>
<br>
Falwell: &quot;Pat, did you notice yesterday that the ACLU and all the Christ-haters, the People for the American Way, NOW, etc., were totally disregarded by the Democrats and the Republicans in both houses of Congress, as they went out on the steps and and called out to God in prayer and sang 'God bless America' and said, let the ACLU be hanged. In other words, when the nation is on its knees, the only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do is what we ought to be doing all the time, calling on God.&quot;<br />

    As you may have noticed the site has been going up and down a lot lately (insert your own &quot;up and down&quot; bawdy joke here). To top it off one of my sites was hacked and I finally had enough of dealing with hosting services, so I made my own ISP style host.<br>
<br>
So now I am currently hosting 3 complete domains (email and all) from my server. I updated my host denial file to block out something in the area of 3000 known hacking IP addresses and secured most of the file services, implemented a backup procedure and redirected all my hosts. Now I will hopefully have a hacked free service experience.<br>
<br>
As usual such things have force me to gain a lot of knowledge, which alwasy translates as a good thing.<br>
<br>
In any case for the dozen or so people who visit here, thanks for hanging in.<br>

    Yeah, I mean you. You are from the lower 90% of the economy. If your in the top 10% then your assistant is reading this, and they are part of the lower 90%. So lets get that fact out in the open.<br>
<br>
And your income and net worth is <a href="http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20040105&amp;s=krugman">7% less than it might have been in 1973</a>. While the media and the government love to tell us that the economy is booming, they fail to point out that it isn't booming for you and me. It is booming for that top 10 percent who have increased their annual incomes by 148%, and REALLY booming for the top 1% or even .001% most of all who are making 599% more than they would have in 1973!<br>
<br>
How is this? Well consider the way the economy has shifted recently: everything has gone up but your wages. I am sure everyone got their average 2-5% increases that companies throw at you and everyone gladly took it. But consider what you are going to do with that 3% on average: your going to lose it in the almost 8% increase in the cost of living.<br>
<br>
Consider that the government has subsidized the use of personal vehicles (to help a huge and wasteful industry grow no less) which now cost 25% more to operate than it did a year ago (gas alone can account for that). And so the average Joe who has to drive to work loses literally dollars a day just getting to that job that doesn't even cover the cost of this change alone.<br>
<br>
But more amazing is the fact that people who are economically worse off under economic Conservatives (or Republicans - since both words are starting to have the same meaning) will continue to vote for people who are going to insure that the bottom 90% stay on the bottom. Why? Because supposedly conservatives represent the same morality as the majority of the country.<br>
<br>
The Democrats would do well to pay attention now. Because you see, even the Democratic (or Liberal) lawmakers are normally from the top 10% as well. And to be fair, they want to keep it that way too, but at least they make some efforts to let the other 90% lead decent lives. The more Consevative/Republican factions; they would rather you become their indentured servants. And you will.<br>
<br>
But the Democrats fail to win some big elections because they forget to go on about issues that people can actually have the warm-fuzzies on - morality, patriotism and banal assurances that the 90% are going to enjoy economic growth. It's easy to polarize people and get them riled up over the evil-doers. Very few people would even jokingly say &quot;I am evil.&quot; We all want to be the good guys. Most people can identify with a polititian who has a clear message spoken with small words. My little bit here is probably producing glazed looks because I am talking about income and economics, and ... YAWN.... But if I shift to something inane like &quot;freedom haters,&quot; eyes open up and we have a topic people can get passionate about! Yay &quot;freedom lovers!&quot; What the hell does that mean anyway?<br>
<br>
Back on the subject matter; People continue to follow the misguided notion that a growing economy means growth for them. This means they will support things like privatized retirement plans, removal of the estate taxes and tax shelters for the wealthy. And then we grumble and bear with tax cuts to public schools (the top 10% go to private schools, thank you), reduced scholarships, cuts in healthcare (which is unaffordable to anyone who isn't wealthy or currently indentured - I mean employed) as well as reduced economic incentives to small businesses, etc. <br>
<br>
Add to this the growing reliance upon credit, which has to be paid eventually; people are probably going to die with their school debts unpaid soon. But you need to keep the economy strong! You need to go buy stuff! Spend money! Why? who really benefits from larger retail activity? Why Walmart does! Yay for Walmart....huh? The largest purveyor of dead-end, low paying, menial treatment careers? They get so many tax breaks it is outragous. But they are an example of where the economy is growing the most.<br>
<br>
Only the largest corporations have the venture capitol to open a new business, and many of them do so by putting their headquarters off-shore. Anyone who starts a business prays some big huge conglomerate comes along and buys them out. That is hitting the motherload! Well only if your an owner, and that means your likely from an economically higher level family anyway. <br>
<br>
But thats ok, the rest of your employees will be swallowed up and left in their dead-end jobs until they retire and are forced to conserve whatever they have until cat food starts looking like a viable meal. Hmm...does this make them Conservatives?<br>
<br>
What does this all lead up to? Well it means you and me (and the other 90%) are going to support less than 10% with out meagre share of the pie. When more pie is made available (due to our efforts by the way), we will likely not get any more pie. We might even lose a bit here and there. But when is enough wealth enough? I just asked the wrong question really, the real question is why horde all the wealth into one place. Why not allow a more level society, with better public transport, less waste, more true and real incentives to achieve?<br>
<br>
Power. Pure and simple.<br>
<br>
If you spend every waking hour toiling under the yoke, then what else is there? You live to work, and work to live. You will die working. Because you believe that the economy is growing, and that you might one day get your big break, you will break yourself to succeed. <br>
<br>
What if you found out that for every dollar you earn, you are making a bunch of other people else $600? I don't mean one person getting $600 but a group of people getting it...All those managers, lawyers, middle managers, CEOs or just goverment cronies take $600 before they give you one. You would be pretty pissed off wouldn't you?<br>
<br>
Here's a dollar...<br>
