<font class="print-normal">I myself never wear T-shirts with logos. I don't like the idea of advertising brand names, especially when I have no idea who is behind the brand. I come from a  school of thought that suggests if you wear someone else's logo your subscribing to their beliefs and ideals and letting the world know where you stand. Once people whore the &quot;logo&quot; of their king, country, religion or other group to show they &quot;belonged&quot; to that group. People like that sense of belonging and so we continue this tradition in the displaying of labels. But in modern society labels are nothing more than a display of a demographic. Many do not even considering who is behind the logo and what they represent. Logos and allegances are switched as easily as buying a new shirt or changing who makes your latte.<br>
<br>
Lauren Raheja in an <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/4865263.html" target="_blank">article</a> in the Star Tribune discusses the duality between a corporate entity and the image they attempt to portray using Urban Outfitters and Chipotle restaurants as examples. I knew of Urban Outfitter's very conservative (and anti-gay) corporate leanings way back. I am not in the business of telling people where to shop and who to support, that is an individual descision. But I do urge we all take a moment and check out who we are supporting, but even that is a daunting task as no one is really forthcoming about their personal ideology when they can hide behind a corporate image.<br>
<br>
It doesn't seem like a big deal to many that they buy a shirt from say, the Gap. But consider how much of the money you gave makes it to the person who made it, delivered it, sold it or even put it on the shelf? Then think about how much goes to some executive and where is his or her money going? Does the company finance local community projects or do they donate money to political campaigns? Why does it matter? <br>
<br>
Well lets say you paid $25 for a shirt. What did it cost the retailer to make this shirt? An informal guess based upon my experiences in retail is that the final price is 50%-100% higher than the cost to the final retailer. That means $12.50 is split between the manufacturer and retailer. That isn't much but lets go further. Most manufactured products cost about 50% to manufacture of what they are sold to the retailer for. So we now widdle $6.75 out and split that between the manufacturing, shipping and packaging, etc. The other $6.75 goes to the company, which is used to pay executives and staff.<br>
<br>
Now lets reverse things a bit. Say there are 150 stores, and each store sells about 2 of these shirts a day, or 300 shirts per day. Doesn't seem like much but lets go a step further and average out the sale of this shirt to a lower 1 shirt per day over a 3 month sales season (90 days to make things easier). Well now we have 13,500 shirts! It's likely they made many more to save on costs and are dumping the excess into odd job lots or selling them off to overseas markets, but we will not deal with that.<br>
<br>
At $6.75 profit per shirt, this company has made $91,125. Not shabby for a run of a single shirt. Now what if the company's HQ is in say Vermont? Vermont might want to enact a higher corporate tax, or maybe enact stricter hiring guidelines. Maybe the CEO and a couple buddies on the board are against a specific group or maybe the government is getting tougher on their importing the shirts from soem third world country and they are going to have to pay workers $.50 per shirt instead of $.25. So the CEO begins to donate his own money and gets the company to make corporate donations to a candidate that is amicable to their line of thinking. Maybe he even goes as far as donting wardrobes or even letting the candidates use his shipping warehouse for a friendly photo-op.<br>
<br>
There are lots of ways how your small support combines to make a big difference. Money isn't the only thing that supports a company. Public consumption of a product is an endorsment, and trust me anything to promote a product is good advertising. Why do you think every wrapper from a fast food chain has it's logo? Why do clothes have a label? So that you can advertise as you consume! By purchasing and using a product you overtly support it and the company behind the product.<br>
<br>
Should this politian write you a thank you note for your $6.75 donation?<br /><br />
