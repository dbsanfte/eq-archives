<font class="print-normal">So this morning Office Services came by with a Ziploc freezer bag containing a yellow flashlight and a small 8 oz bottle of water. This is the emergency kit in case of another black out and we had to walk down the emergency stairs with out lights again.

&quot;WHAT?&quot;, I laughed, &quot;what I was supposed to do with this in case of a real emergency?&quot;
He laughed and said, &quot;Who cares. I was told to hand these out. Do you feel safer now?&quot;

Truth be told - no.<br /><br />
But lets examine this. I am not one to ever feel &quot;unsafe&quot;. I am 6-4 and of healthy proportion and good physical health. Very little actually threatens me in a physical way. I have some social phobias but therapy has helped me deal with them pretty well.

On the other hand I acknowledge our frailty. I realize that a truly concerted effort by a single individual or even a small group can accomplish great havoc. But so what? NYC used to have a high crime rate. But according to what standard. Per capita NYC was relatively safe - meaning that there are so many people here the likelihood of a crime being committed against any individual is rather small.

With this in mind I don't worry about a crime being committed against me. In fact I do what I can to minimize my risks, but I cannot spend mental time worrying about what may or may not happen. Why worry about what I ultimately cannot control?

So this brings me around to the silliness of a &quot;flashlight in every desk and a water bottle in every hand&quot; scenario being set up at my job. There are normal and extreme responses to any emergency. We live and learn and take proper precaution in case it ever happens again. Now, is it reasonable to have 500 employees get a flashlight in case of a black out? No I think that is bizarre. Why such an over reaction? Well of course you and I both know it has more to do with 9/11 than a blackout. And lately everyone has been going on about terrorism like it was just invented. 

Fact is it has been around since the first person decided he could not stand up to another directly. Terrorism is basically intimidation. Hit your opponent in ways they cannot defend or strike back against until they back off in fear. During W.W.II German U-boats may or may not have been off the coast of Long Island. People spotted them and stories circulated and I am sure there was an occasional German ship in the area. The fact that people BELIEVED they were there was more powerful than any ship ever invented.

During castle sieges it was common to toss the heads of the fallen into the castle hoping someone would recognize a friend. Even more sinister was the throwing of rancid meat and rotting corpses into a besieged city with the hope of sickening the besieged, allowing it to fall even faster. I believe this falls under what we now scream from headlines: bioterrorism.

So what is the big deal now? Why are we suddenly on the run? Well there are two possibilities. One we actually got so fat and weak we forgot people really hate(or are jealous of) America (and Americans) so much they are willing to lose their lives to strike at the big behemoth. The other possibility is that we never before had this bizarre media circus to help us heighten our fears. I tend to think the first option is partially to blame but I think our news media needs to check itself quickly.

One could argue that people felt fear in the past and certainly the rumor mill churned rapidly in any area. But the rumor mill had a face: It was your neighbor. That was solace in itself. You felt that this person who was telling you your fears might be realized was in it with you. these people felt the fear but also went on with their lives. TV doesn't promote any sense of community at all. In fact TV, and by proxy advertising, have been shown to be a very singular experience. Watching TV with someone is not being with that person at all.

But sometimes printed news isn't much better. I love to read the papers and compare what each focuses on. Interestingly there are odd correlation in how they operate. The cheaper ones tend to have bigger headlines with lots of exclamation points and full color spreads on the latest sports. Sorry but the Local Yokals win another baseball game isn't news. In fact, who cares? It is just a diversion.

Then there are the pricier papers. These have lots of news. But then you get insane ads for a frying pan that costs $500. It is hand made in Tibet and part of the proceeds go to help someone who is starving - possibly the guy next to the reader on the subway. All this to to soothe away the guilt of paying $500 for a $5 frying pan made in Detroit. What form of reality is that?

Then we go back to TV news. It has more to do with the weather than actual news. &quot;What you don't know about Ice Cream could KILL YOUR KIDS! - News at 11&quot;. Are they serious? You bet because advertising pays for that crap, and the unwashed masses eat it up. But then again a lot of this reflects the old adage: give the people what they want.

We want less real information and more hockus pockus. We don't want to know the reality of what is going on in the world. We have no interest in dealing with &quot;bad people&quot; coming to get us. We would rather watch &quot;Charmed&quot; after watching our State sponsored war news coverage then to actually go out and see what is happening. Why is it the papers usually only post 2 deaths in Iraq a day (which is what the State Dept. releases by the way)? It is so if you happen to actually read the small print news item in the page you won't be outraged by the actual numbers who are dying. I am not condemning the war in Iraq at all. I believe we did the right thing for all the wrong reason though.

At first Bush would appear to be a fool for announce the war over. I think we have a few years ahead of us before that even can be seen as a possibility. Once it was announced the war was over the press became like a cop standing over a dead body announcing &quot;Nothing to see here&quot;.

Unless of course there is a good bombing threat that can cause a litle controlled fear...then we need to hear about it, right after we find out how ice cream can KILL OUR KIDS! But first, lets look at sports.<br />
