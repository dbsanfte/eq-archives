<font class="print-normal">Luckily there are still a lot of writers with clear heads in this country. Rather than re-hash what everyone else said, I will instead direct you to their commentary.<br>
<br>
This <A href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/mld/cctimes/news/opinion/8943988.htm?1c" target="_blank">article</a> from Molly Ivins entitled &quot;This was the day that the Constitution was discarded,&quot; discusses John Ashroft's assertation that President Bush was somehow above the law and should not even be questioned regarding the accusation of condoning torture. &quot;To justify torture, these memos declare that the president is bound by neither U.S. law nor international treaties. We have put ourselves on the same moral level as Saddam Hussein, the only difference being quantity.&quot;<br>
<br>
This <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/consequential_lies.php" target="_blank">opinion piece</a> from TomPaine.com discusses the world of half-truths and lies we have been subjected to. &quot;With violence steadily increasing in Iraq and the 9/11 commission hearings about to resume, the White House spin machine shifted into a tried and tested gear—a technique described as “most brilliant” by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels:  'It must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over.'&quot; Well hurray for public discourse!<br>
<br>
An <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/afp/20040617/pl_afp/us_attacks_report_press_040617150533" target="_blank">article</a> on Yahoo about the new York Times calling for President Bush to apologize for wagingw ar on Iraq using false information. I do have to admit this quote: &quot;There are two unpleasant alternatives: either Mr. Bush knew he was not telling the truth, or he has a capacity for politically motivated self-deception that is terrifying in the post-9/11 world,&quot; is a rather pithy statement.<br>
<br>
Donald Rumsfeld doesn't seem to understand what the big fuss is. In this <A href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=542&amp;ncid=693&amp;e=6&amp;u=/ap/20040617/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/shadow_prisoners" target="_blank">article</a> from Yahoo he defends the idea that prisoners could be held without being processed. &quot;The defense secretary said such a call would be to prevent the prisoner's interrogation from being interrupted.&quot; I suggest closing the door next time.<br /><br />
