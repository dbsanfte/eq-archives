<font class="print-normal"><p>Check out this interesting <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/inews/stories.php?story=01/09/23/0514419" target="_blank">interview</a> with Noam Chomsky at <a href="http://www.infoshop.org">Infoshop.org</a>.<br>
<br>
<p>From the Interview:<br><br>
At first the US used the word &quot;crusade,&quot; but it was quickly pointed out that if they hope to enlist their allies in the Islamic world, that is a serious mistake, for obvious reasons. The rhetoric therefore shifted to &quot;war.&quot; The Gulf war of 1991 was called a war. The bombing of Serbia was called a &quot;humanitarian intervention,&quot; by no means a novel usage. That was a standard description of European imperialist ventures in the 19th century. To cite some more recent examples, the major recent scholarly work on &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot; cites three examples of &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot; in the immediate pre-World War II period: Japan's invasion of Manchuria, Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia, and Hitler's takeover of the Sudetenland. The author of course is not suggesting that the term is apt; rather, that the crimes were masked as &quot;humanitarian.&quot; But the pretext of &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot; cannot be used in the normal way in the present case. So we are left with &quot;war.&quot; <br>
<p>To call it a &quot;war against terrorism,&quot; however, is simply more propaganda, unless the &quot;war&quot; really does target terrorism. But that is plainly not contemplated. Perhaps I may quote political scientist Michael Stohl: &quot;We must recognize that by convention -- and it must be emphasized _only_ by convention -- great power use and the threat of the use of force is normally described as coercive diplomacy and not as a form of terrorism,&quot; though it commonly involves &quot;the threat and often the use of violence for what would be described as terroristic purposes were it not great powers who were pursuing the very same tactic,&quot; in accord with the literal meaning of the term. Under the (admittedly, unimaginable) circumstances that Western intellectual culture were willing to adopt the literal meaning, the war against terrorism would take quite a different form, along lines spelled out in extensive detail in literature that does not enter the respectable canon.<br>
