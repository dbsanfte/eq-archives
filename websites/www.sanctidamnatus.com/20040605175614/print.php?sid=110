<font class="print-normal"><p>Spring is in the air and things have begun to really heat up around here. <br>
<p>The <a href="http://www.washingttonpost.com" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> has an interesting <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53051-2004Apr5.html?referrer=email" target="_blank">article</a> about Edward Kennedy bashing President Bush. While I am inclined to agree with Mr. Kennedy's arguments, I always wonder if we could get a better poster boy?<br>
<p>In <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56940-2004Apr7.html" target="_blank">a related article</a> in the Washington Post, the Iraq war seems to be causing President Bush's approval rating to drop. Many are realizing that the June 30th deadline will not likely happen. The likelyhood of a civil war in Irag looms large and certainly that would make the entire Irag war effort seem a failure (especially if a side we don't like wins). And related to this, Americans are starting to realize they do not &quot;feel&quot; safer. The essential perception is what needs to be dealt with more than the reality. <br>
<p>One possible motivator for recent activities could be related to recent events in Spain, which may have emboldened various factions world wide to play their hand in hopes of effecting the upcoming elections here. This possibility has not recieved much media attention after the Spanish elections, but I am certainly curious to see what develops as we get closer to November.<br>
<p>On top of all this the President was essentially forced to allow Condoleeza Rice to testify in public and under oath. I am sure many wait with baited breath to hear what the &quot;Warrior Princess&quot; has to say. The commision has basically announced that 9/11 could have been prevented, and I cannot imagine how Ms. Rice can put a positive spin on this. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" target="_blank">N.Y. Times</a> even goes so far as to refer to her as &quot;The Performer&quot; in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/04/weekinreview/04bumi.html" target="_blank">article</a> by the same name, and rightly acknowledges that a lot rests on her shoulders. Much to Ms. Rice's credit though, even with questions arising about her depth of experience, she is likely the most capable person in the entire administration today.<br>
<p>Recently the Bush administration was crowing like roosters over 300,000 new jobs being created. What many don't realize is this is the <b>first</b> time this happened in years (I cannot find the details but it may be the first time during the Bush Administration). Even with another 300,000 new jobs a month, President Bush's term will end with a huge loss in jobs. As the Washingtin Post aricle notes, the only thing that seems to give the Bush Administration hope is that enough jobs will be generated before the elections.<br>
<p>As always I am interested to hear what you might have to say.
