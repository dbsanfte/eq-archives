<P>November 18, 2003: Gallery Update<BR>
Just a quick update of the galleries today. More epic weapons have been added, with many more on the way. I've also added the zones 
gallery, which just shows off bits of scenery from various zones... many more to come. Pictures of Bertoxxulous and Terris Thule have also 
been added.</P>

<P>November 17, 2003: Gallery Update<BR>
Performed a quick update to the gallery area. I've also updated the stats, spells and gallery in my profile area. The Plane of Sky quests faq 
is going through final proofreading and will be online soon.</P>

<P>November 5, 2003: Updates Underway<BR>
All sections are mostly online. A few of the galleries need to have content re-added. The private area access request page has been disabled 
at the moment, but will be readded under the contact section. I have one completely new quest FAQ almost ready, plus several others that 
have been offline for a while. You'll also notice that the format of the ranger epic and earring of solstice faqs has been changed to reduce 
the overall page count and any redundancies that were occuring as a result of the same information being presented in multiple areas.</P>

<P>November 3, 2003: Navagation Changes<BR>
Navagation menus have been changed. The profile section has been completed again with the exception of the spellbook.</P>

<P>September 23, 2002: Private Access?<BR>
I'm currently working on a new private access area.</P>
