<P>01-12-2005: <A HREF="/gallery/index.html">Now in stereo!</A><BR>
All movies went through a minor sound quality update and now play in stereo instead of the original mono sound.</P>

<P>01-12-2005: Few Changes...<BR>
I moved everything in the magic section to resources as there really was not much in the way of content there to begin with. This gave me room to start a new area for cooking. 
While the section has been created, no actual content has been added yet. I've also made a few changes to the fashion section. It's 4:30am here and feeling a bit tired... more 
later.</P>

<P>01-11-2005: <A HREF="/quests/bastok-other.html">More Bastok Quests!</A><BR>
Added three quests to the "Other Bastok Quests" page: The Quadav's Curse, The Stars of Ifrit and Welcome to Bastok. Two of these could have been added a while ago, but I 
had just recently got around to going back to talk to the NPC to finish the quest off.</P>

<P>01-09-2005: <A HREF="/gallery/images-biteemee.html">Biteemee's Gallery of Uberance add</A><BR>
New section added to the gallery area. All screen shots were taken by Biteemee on Gilgamesh Server. I also added another notorious monster to the NM gallery.</P>

<P>01-08-2005: Lovely Shiva<BR>
I added pictures today of the <A HREF="/gallery/images-areas.html">Cloister of Frost</A> and of <A HREF="/gallery/images-nms.html">Shiva Prime</A>. Despite what the second 
picture suggests, we did end up beating Shiva and on Iceday. I also added the quest "<A HREF="/quests/index.html">Trial by Ice</A>," which is for the high-level Shiva Prime 
battle.</P>

<P>01-07-2005: <A HREF="/gallery/images-nms.html">Notorious Monsters Gallery</A> is back online!<BR>
You better not pout. You better not cry. You better not SHOUT, I'm telling you why!<BR>
The Notorious Monsters are coming to town!<BR>
They see you when you're camping. They Know if you're A-F-K...<BR>
Okay so it is a month late for Christmas Carols, but after having accumulated more screen shots since I first had the NM gallery, it now have enough to make it worth giving them 
their own section.</P>

<P><A HREF="/gallery/event2k4-starlight.html"><IMG SRC="/images/main/event-2k4starlight.jpg" ALT="Starlight Celebration" WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="106" BORDER="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>
01-05-2005: I added a section for the recent "Starlight Celebration" event to the gallery area. The quests section was reformated to cover quests by location. The more 
noteworthy quests that I have completed were given individual entries, with less significant quests going into "other" sections. I considered giving each quest it's own individual 
entry, but there were some quests that I really wanted to keep grouped together. The fashion section has been implemented, but I'm not completely happy with it so will be 
making some changes. Thumbnail images on the mage page for the gallery section were removed to save on space. I also felt that they were not really making the page any 
better.</P>
