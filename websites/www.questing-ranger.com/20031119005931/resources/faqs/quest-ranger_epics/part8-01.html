<P>Swiftwind and Earthcaller: Walkthrough Part 8 - Swiftwind and Earthcaller</P>

<P><B>Jaeil the Wretched in The Hole, Odus</B></P>

<P><I>Jaeil the Wretched can be found in The Hole. I do not have a location for him because he is not hard to find. He does not despawn
and should always be there. The only hard part here is getting to Jaeil the Wretched. If you can get there, you should be able to deal with
Jaeil the Insane with no problems. This will be a triggered spawn, and you will need to be prepared to fight him.</I></P>

<P>Jaeil the Wretched whimpers pathetically as his reflection catches his eye. He turns and stares pitifully at the ceiling.</P>

<P>Jaeil the Wretched shields his eyes from his reflection in the water, occasionally gibbering as he scratches at a flapping, rotted patch
of skin on his sunken face. In his arms he cradles something. He seems to emanate an aura of power.</P>

<P><I>Stand behind Jaeil the Wretched to make him indifferent to you by using sneak. Be sure to /CON him to confirm that he is
indifferent.</I></P>

<P>*Give Jaeil the Wretched the Shiny Tin Bowl so that he will see his reflection.*<BR>
Jaeil the Wretched howls in anger, his body seeming to suck energy from the walls around him as he sees his reflection. He pulls a hammer
from the bundle in his arms and swings fiercely at your head.</P>

<P>Name: Jaeil the Insane</P>
Level: 50<BR>
Class: Necromancer<BR>
While Jaeil the Insane is a necromancer based mob, he is a very weak one.</P>

<P>Setup:<BR>
In all cases, you will want to setup just around the corner and up the incline from Jaeil the Wretched. The differences though come from
how you actually get there.</P>

<P>Getting to Camp - Standard:<BR>
The standard method is to just fight your way down, with typically two to three groups of people. The key thing here is to not go so slow
that you get caught up in respawn but not so fast that your clerics and enchanters will be low or out of mana at the more difficult
spawns.</P>

<P>Getting to Camp - Alternate:<BR>
Have a magician suicide to create a corpse then consent a Necromancer who pulls the Magicians corpse down to the camp sport (or a spot
close by that is free of wanderers.) It will be necessary to Feign Death at times drop mob agro. When the corpse is at the camp location,
he then resurrects the Magician using an Essence Emerald. The Magician then uses Call of Hero to summon everyone else down to the camp
spot.</P>

<P>Tactics:<BR>
Area effect spells should not be used due to the close proximity of Jaeil the Wretched. Once Jaeil the Insane is pulled to where your forces
await, he is an easy fight. There is no one best strategy to use him as even a zerg rush will do the job effectively.</P>

<P><I>Jaeil the Insane spawns and attacks. Jaeil the Wretched will still be there; just ignore him as he is not part of the fight. You only
need to fight Jaeil the Insane.</I></P>

<P>Kill Jaeil the Insane and loot the "<A href="javascript:popupOldInventory('soulbound_hammer')">Soulbound Hammer</A>" to give to Mairee
Silentone.</P>

<P><I>If for any reason your entire raiding party dies at Jaeil the Insane or on the way there, the easiest way to recover is by having some
people make Halfling Rogues that worship Brell Serilis, then have a Druid port to Misty Thicket to pick them up and port them to Toxxulia
Forest, cast Spirt of the Wolf, then run to the Hole. Additionally, you can bind in the Paineel area, near the lake outside The Hole. If you
duck, you should be able to fit through the crack in the door. Most mobs in The Hole will look at these characters dubiously, but will not
argo. For the ones that will argo, you can Hide and Sneak to get past them. You will want at least two - one to drag corpses from past
the drop down point to the ledge and a second to drag corpses from the ledge to near the entrance area. It can be done with just one,
but will go faster with two.</I></P>
