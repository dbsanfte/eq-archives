<P><B>South San d'Oria Quests</B></P>

<P><B>A Knight's Test</B> [Paladin Part 3]<BR>
Client: Balasiel<BR>
Location: Watchdog Alley [F-7]<BR>
Requirements: A Squire's Test II, Level 30+<BR>
Items: Book of Tactics, Book of the West, Book of the East, Knight's Soul<BR>
Reward: Kite Shield, Paladin Job<BR>
Title: Tried and Tested Knight</P>

<P>At this point, you will want to talk to the guards in the towers overlooking Victory Square in South San d'Oria. You can find the entrance to the East Tower at [L-8], where 
you will talk to Cahaurme for the Book of the East. The entrance for the West Tower is at [G-9], which leads to Baurise, who gives you the Book of the West. The guards may 
be talked to in either order.</P>

<P>Once this is done, you need to head to E-10 in Davoi. Having the map for this area will help a lot as you will need to walk through some water. If you are doing this solo, 
keep invisibility up at all times as all orcs and pugil will agro. Around the well itself, you may see a slim type mob. This will detect by sound or smell but not sight. If there is no 
orc nearby, find a good spot to put up these two buffs then head for the well to get the Knight's Soul. If there is an orc around the well in addition to the slime, you may want 
to try waiting for the orc to look the other way to drop invisibility or even eat a death to get the key item. Regardless of how you get it, return to Balasiel afterwards to get a 
Kite Shield and the ability to select the paladin job.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>A Sentry's Peril</B><BR>
Client: Glenne<BR>
Location: Pikeman's Way [F-8]<BR>
Items: Ointment, Ointment Case<BR>
Reward: Bronze Subligar<BR>
Title: Ronfaurian Rescuer</P>

<P>Both items used in this quest will be given to you by the two NPCs that you interact with. Also after you talk to Glenne, exit San d'Oria through the west gate and follow 
the road to find Aaveleon.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>A Squire's Test</B> [Paladins Part 1]<BR>
Client: Balasiel<BR>
Location: Watchdog Alley [F-7]<BR>
Items: Revival Root<BR>
Reward: Spatha</P>

<P>This is the first of three quests that must be completed in order to eventually unlock the paladin job. While the quest specifies King Ranperre's Tomb, the root is a rare drop 
off any undead anywhere. [I got mine from a Tainted Hound in Konschtat Highlands.] They call also be purchased at the auction house under materials.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>A Squire's Test II</B> [Paladins Part 2]<BR>
Client: Balasiel<BR>
Location: Watchdog Alley [F-7]<BR>
Requirements: A Squire's Test<BR>
Items: Stalactite Dew<BR>
Reward: Squire's Certificate<BR>
Title: Spelunker</P>

<P>If you talk to Chanpau, near Balasiel, he'll suggest that you bring back stalactite dew. You'll want to go to the Cathedral in North San d'Oria at this point to talk to Morjean 
to learn how to get it. At this point you will want to head to Ordelle's Caves. In the first room, you will want to follow the winding path that is towards the right until you come 
to a room with a bunch of Fungars. There are a bunch of them and they will agro even at L30, even though most of the stuff in the cave will not at this point. I used Sneak, 
buch if you are not playing a mage class you will need either items that will give you this ability or maybe a few friends to help you clear through them.</P>

<P>There are now two paths that you can take. If you have a map, take the one that doesn't lead towards La Theine to get to the room with a pool of water. Make sure that 
sneak is still up as there are more fungars here also. You'll want to get close to the water to touch it, then check the stalactites in the room that are a bit away from the pool. 
One of them will be targetable and if you are fast enough, you will get the dew after having touched the water. Once you have the dew, just bring it back to Balasiel.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>A Timely Visit</B> - <I>incomplete</I><BR>
Client: Elimemague<BR>
Location: Watchdog Alley</P>

<P>This quest is started by talking to Deraquien in South San d'Oria. After an intermission, you will want to head to wear the knights are practicing in La Theine Plateau and 
talk to Equesobillot, then talk to Narvecaint in the same area. You will now be sent back to Deraquien.</P>

Location: House on Squire Alley [M-7]<BR>
Items: Well Water, Tomb Guard's Waterskin<BR>
Reward: 560G<BR>
Title: Royal Grave Keeper</P>

<P>This is a fairly easy and straightforward quest. Andecia gives you the well water that you need, which you then trade to the Tombstone. The waterskin that you get in 
return is then taken back to Andecia for the reward.</P>

Client: Rosel<BR>
Location: Rosel's Armor Shop [K-7]<BR>
Items: Receipt for the Prince<BR>
Reward: 100G or 200G</P>

<P>You'll want to pay attention to the intermission carefully so that you know which prince you need to make the delivery for as it is supposedly random. Also you do not need to 
be able to enter the Chateau as you just talk to the guard Guilermo out front who gives the receipt to the price for you.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Sleepless Nights</B><BR>
Client: Paoula<BR>
Location: House on Squire Alley [M-8]<BR>
Items: Mary's Milk<BR>
Reward: 5,000G</P>

<P>Mary's Milk only drops from the notorious monster Stray Mary in Konschtat Highlands. This is a highly sought after notorious monster as her horn is highly prized by bards 
and sells for a lot at the AH. The milk can also be purchased from the auction house as a food ingredient. It should be kept in mind here that the AH price of this item varies. 
Sometimes you will find it for less than 5,000 but generally not by much. More often than not, it will sell for more than 5,000 so you may want to consider waiting until you can 
kill Stray Mary.</P>
