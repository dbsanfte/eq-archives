<P>7-23-2004: Added sections to the gallery for artifact armor and regions. I've also added a section for random miscellaneous images that do not fit into any of the other 
categories.</P>

<P>7-22-2004: Added two new subsections to the gallery area. One for pictues of Notorious Monsters and the other for Summoner Aeons. These two sections are complete for 
the time being until I take more screen shots.</P>

<P>7-20-2004: Several more quests were added - <A HREF="/quests/jeuno-upper.html">A Candlelight Vigil</A>, 
<A HREF="quests/sandoria-port.html">A Job for the Consortium</A>, <A HREF="/quests/jeuno-upper.html">Candle Making</A> and 
<A HREF="/quests/jeuno-lower.html">The Goblin Tailor</A>. I've also updated the walkthrough for <A HREF="/quests/town-selbina.html">An Explorer's Footsteps</A>, which 
rewards you with the Map of Crawler's Nest.</P>

<P>07-19-2004: Extras section was added.</P>

<P>07-17-2004: Some changes were made to the equipment section. I still want to add images, but the factual data is at least complete for now.</P>

<P>07-08-2004: I got two more of the stone monuments for the Crawler's Nest Map quest [under Selbina quests] and rearanged the order that they are listed to be in 
chronological order according to the date on the monuments. I also added the second mog house upgrade quest as well as the summoner job quest. Other than getting 
Carbuncle's Ruby, which is just rare in a very lame and extremely tedious way [which doesn't make it hard just lame and tedious] - this job quest has been very very easy.</P>

<P>07-07-2004: EverQuest faqs have been moved off site. Akanesotome Asha`man has kindly given some space for them thus you can now access them all at the following 
URL: <A HREF="http://www.thefellowshipquests.com/ranger/">http://www.thefellowshipquests.com/ranger/</A>. As for my site, you'll notice that I've added a new section 
called "regions" which is still being worked on.</P>

<P>06-29-2004: Finally another update. I did another revamp of things and think I am happy with how things are now for the most part... I'll be adding more content stuff 
soon. =)</P>

<P>06-09-2004: Updated the header links to reflect FFXI as I am playing this more. EQ has been uninstalled at this point, though I am still retaining a section for faqs for the 
game. If you want to reproduce any on your own website, by all means do so as I am not promising that I will keep the EQ faqs around indefinately. More likely than not, there 
will come a point that I will go so far as to actually remove that section.</P>

<P>06-05-2004: Links and contact pages were updated to remove EverQuest... I plan to update all the graphic headers soon to reflect FFXI. Indulgence section still has the 
old header menu simply because I have not decided yet if I am even going to keep it.</P>

<P>05-31-2004: So long, EverQuest! While my account for EQ has been canceled, it is not for sale [so don't ask.] I have also already uninstalled the game so will not be giving 
away anything that I haven't already. As for my website, this does mean that there will be no new EQ-related content in the future outside of the occasional shockwave movie. 
All existing FAQs related to EQ will remain here somewhere but will not be updated at any point in the future nor will new ones for EQ be added. As always, you are more than 
welcome to reproduce them elsewhere.</P>

<P>05-17-2004: "QuarmTron: Defender of Time" movie is now available for watching in the gallery section.</P>
