<P><B>Part 1 - Scepter of Akelha Ra Frame</B></P>

Doing this part solo requires that you have both Spirit of Wolf and Invisibility/Super Camoflage. This may work with Run 3 or Swift Journey 2 instead of Spirit 
of Wolf, but I'm not making promises as I never got Run 3 while I was working on these. One thing to keep in mind is this method is extremely rude towards 
other people in the zone who are there for experience or whatever. I only advocate using this method when there are no other people present.</P>

<P>Items Needed Before You Start:<BR>
* Wisp Stone (No Rent): give to a Shimmering Presence<BR>
* Essence Emerald: give to the Spirit of Akelha'Ra</P>

<P>The only mobs that see through invisibility spells are the mobs which are triggered by the various traps in the zone and the mobs at the front of the 
Sacrificial Pit. In most areas, these traps are usually around the white rocks you see in the corners of rooms and along side the hallways. For the hallway 
area leading to the pit, I am not 100% sure where the traps are thus would consider this entire hall unsafe. However the previous rule does seem to hold 
true here as well in that traps tend to be triggered by stepping on visible white rocks in the zone. Should you hit a trap, just run back to the zone. If you 
have Spirit of Wolf up, the mobs will not be able to keep up and you will quickly lose them. Recast Spirit of Wolf when you are outside. With enough 
attempts, you will have set off all the traps thus given yourself a clear patch and should make it all the way to the Sacrifice Pit.</P>

<P>To get to the Sacrifice Pit, go straight ahead to the second room [where Va'Dyn spawns.] From here go right to the next room which has nothing 
noteworthy or significant about it. Enter the next hallway and you have the choice of going left or right. To the right is the room where The Itraer Vius 
spawns, and you may [or may not] see the carpet in the middle of the room. To the left, you will see what is best described as a fence. You need to go 
left to the fence and through one of the openings.</P>

<P>You will see a bunch of mobs between you and the pit. These mobs all through invisibility types of spells. However, you can walk around them easily if 
you are careful as they are not that smart and will not pay any attention to anyone just walking around them. The sides of the room have alien-dude style 
mobs, which shouldn't see though invisibility spells, but you do not need to get close to them either. High above the pit itself are three four-armed aliens, 
which do not see through invisibility. Once you are around the mobs that see through invisibility, jump into the pit where the Sacrificed Remains are and 
press yourself against the back wall. If you are positioned correctly, the three mobs above you will not see you when you drop invisibility.</P>

<P>Something to keep in mind here that there are four Sacrificed Remains, and any one of them can be the placeholder for the Shimmering Presence, which 
will spawn completely invisible as a disembodied floating name. To spawn the Shimmering Presence, you keep killing the Sacrificed Remains over and over again 
until it spawns. Killing the Sacficied Remains that is closest to the edge of the pit to the far right when facing outward will sometimes cause one of the mobs 
in front of the pit to agro. Should this happen, I just run to the zone with Spirit of Wolf and recast when I get out... then head back to the pit. [You should 
now see why this method can be rude to other people in the zone.] Alternatively, you can try doing it where you do not kill this paticular Sacrificed Remains, 
but I didn't try it that way and am not making promisses that it will work.</P>

<P>When the Shimmering Presence does spawn, it may be possitioned where you cannot do the turn-in from where you are standing at the back of the pit. 
Should this be the case, be prepared to do the turn in fast as you will need to move into agro range of the mobs above you to do the turn in. Hotkey one 
general inventory spot and place the Essence Emerald on it, thus allowing you to pick it up very quickly. Move forward and give the Shimmering Presence the 
Wisp Stone, which spawns Spirit of Akelha'Ra [that looks like one of those ghost creatures.] Immediately turn in the Essence Emerald and you have the box. 
At this point, I just ran for the zone. Pit mobs will not follow you past the fence. Once you are past the fence, you are free as the remaining zone mobs are 
all slower than SOW.</P>

<P><B>Part 2 - The 10 Shards</B></P>

<P>Now for the fun part of camping the Shards. These are all called "A Luclid Shard" and all look like a staff. The way to tell which is which is by using the 
identify spell. I.D. Name is in parenthesis.

<P>Acrylia Cavern [Ved]:<BR>
This drops from either Grimling Skullcrackers or Runed Grimlings. Prior to the revamp of this zone, the best place to camp it was at the gate which had two 
Grimlings spawn in front of. You would then kkill these two Grimlings over and over until one of them drops the shard. I have heard claims that other Grimling 
Skullcrackers in the zone can drop it but cannot confirm this. Also keep in mind that i have not camped this shard after the zone revamp.</P>

<P>Akheva Ruins [Dax]<BR>
Go to the Va'Dyn room and set up camp there. When you first enter the room, the corner immedately to your left is a good place to setup for smaller groups 
as it will keep you out of the way from most roamers and some of the traps. Keep in mind that one of the set of white rocks near here is in fact a trap. It is 
best to intentionally trigger this trap and kill the mob, so you do not accidently trigger it later thus creating an add when you don't want one. Rock monsters 
that spawn from the traps do not drop shards. To the left, there is a room with rock monsters that can drop the shard. The harder ones are more likely to 
drop it than the easier ones. A shaman helps a lot here, especially for the harder ones as they can hit very hard for a group around L60. I have marked 
approximate locations of the traps that I do remember as green dots on the map.</P>

<P>Dawnshroud Peaks [Lor]<BR>
Anyway, go to the Rockhopper cave [that is not far from the zone to Maiden's Eye] and keep killing them until one of them drops the shard. This one is super 
easy, and I was soloing them 4 at a time using Panic Animal. Being friendly with the people who are there for either experience or pelts can help a lot as some 
will even be willing to send you a tell if you are not in the zone should the shard drop.</P>

<P>Fungus Grove [Dat]<BR>
This is a one-group activity. A shaman helps a lot here to keep mobs slowed. This shard only drops off of L60 Shik'Nars. [Those blue bug things.] Go to the 
side of the zone that leads towards Twilight Sea. Insteading going up the path, look around the bottom and you will find two of Shik'Nars guarding a tunnel. 
Go through the tunnel and down into the room. You will see a tunnel to the right and another to the left. Go into the tunnel to the right then follow the left 
wall. Eventually you will come to a room with a bunch of L60 Shik'Nars Warriors and the room after that has two Shik'Nar Royals [both L60.] Keep killing the 
Shik'Nar Royals for the shard.</P>

<P>Maiden's Eye [Tak]<BR>
This drops randomly off any static, non-roaming named Goranga. Placeholders are Goranga Scouts. Across from the zone to Dawnshroud Peaks, there is a 
Rock which had three Goranga Scouts. A ranger or druid is needed if you want to pull singles [via harmony.] This one is best doing at off hours as I did die 
a lot just from other players training me during pulls. It can be noted that there are two other static Goranga camps in the zone. One is near the Akheva 
zone, but only has two mobs so isn't that good. The other is in the middle of nowhere and has at least 3 traps around it. Since I do not like either of these 
camps as much, I didn't get there exact location.</P>

<P>The Deep [Raf]<BR>
This one requires a bard or you're potentially looking at pain just trying to get across the invisible bridge. Although I have been told that there is a long way 
around that doesn't require going across the bridge, actually checking this route proves this info to be incorrect so don't bother trying. Also do not enter from 
the Ssraeshza Temple zone-in side unless you like certain death and having Necromancers summon your corpse. Some friends claim that the Thought Leeches 
can drop them as well. While I vaguely remember seeing one drop off a Thought Leech a long time ago, I'm sure that the drop rate is just so much lower that 
you should still make the effort to get across the invisible bridge and go for the Thought Horrors if you can. The best place to camp the shard is around the 
area where the Ancient Shrikers are. To get there, everyone in the group runs to where the invisible bridge is. Don't worry about killing stuff; just make a 
train. Have the bard hit invulnerability song at this point and everyone drops to the bottom of the pit. The group should then camp out to clear agro from 
the run in. Upon returning, set up camp somewhere along the Ancient Shrikers area.</P>

<P>The Grey [Kel]<BR>
The only thing noteworthy here is that you will need an Enduring Breath item as there is there is no air in this zone. The Sun Revenants that drop the shard 
all spawn at the lake.</P>

<P>Sanctus Seru [Kelera]<BR>
This one will probably be soloable for most people, but may involve kiting. It can also be done with a small group of a few people. Head to either of the 
teleporters which will take you to the tower. All Legionnaires [both named and unnamed] in this area can drop the shard. They hit hard, but are easily 
rooted.</P>

<P>Ssraeshza Temple [Vin]<BR>
This drops in the basement mine area from any skeleton, named or otherwise. Mobs on L1 that you need to go past will not see invis nor do the skeletons in 
the basement. The best way to do this is to just AE the mine over and over again. [Try to bring at least one melee with you just in case a Strange Green 
Metal drops as this is needed for Shissarbane weapons and isn't multiquestable.] Any method other than AEing the mine will work but will be extremely slow 
in comparison.</P>

<P>The Scarlet Desert [Set]<BR>
This drops from Sun Revanants and Sun Reavers, which are on the upper plateau area.</P>
 
<HR>

<P><B>Part 3 - Ring of the Shissar</B></P>

<P>This is needed to get to Emperor Ssraeshza. You must collect four items in any order:<BR>
* Taskmaster's Pouch [Basement]<BR>
* Zazuzh's Idol [1st Floor]<BR>
* Zeruzsh's Ring [2nd Floor]<BR>
* Ssraeszian Insignia [3rd Floor]</P>

<P>Put the idol, ring and insignia in the pouch then press the combine button to get the Ring of the Shissar. This is the key to get to Emperor Ssraeshza's 
room in the temple, which is needed to get the Planar Rift. While I probably could flesh this part out some, it really isn't that difficult. The idol and ring can 
both be done as group-group activities. The best time to obtain the pouch is on the way to a raid on Vyzh'dra the Cursed as taskmasters will be killed 
anyway. The insignia can often be obtained on the way to an Emperor raid, so just concentrate on getting the idol and ring if you do not have them 
already.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Part 4 - The Scepter of Shadows</B></P>

<P>Unadorn Scepter of Shadows:<BR>
Place all 10 shards [see part 2 to obtain] in the Scepter of Akelha Ra Frame aka "The Box" [see part 1 to obtain] and press the combine button to get the 
Unadorn Scepter of Shadows.</P>

<P>Place a Planar Rift [which drops from the whimpy mobs that spawn after Emperor Ssraeshza dies] and Glowing Orb of Luclinite [from any Luclin boss level 
mob] in the Unadorn Scepter of Shadows then press the combine button to get The Scepter of Shadows aka "Vex Thal Key."</P>
