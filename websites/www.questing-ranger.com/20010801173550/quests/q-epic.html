<P CLASS="header1"><A NAME="wt-complete">QUEST WALKTHROUGH [COMPLETE VERSION]</A></P>

<P CLASS="text">Although it is possible to do portions of the quest out of order, this walkthrough assumes that you complete each part before 
moving on to the next section. Just in case you have done portions of the quest out of order, I have made note of what items you would have if 
you have been doing the quest in the exact order listed here and which of those are required to complete that part of the quest.</P>

<P CLASS="text">NOTE: If at any point in the quest you need to use sneak to deal with an NPC, you will need to use sneak again at all later 
encounters. Although I will suggest using sneak the during the first encounter with a potentially problematic NPC, you will need to remember to 
use it again for later encounters. This mostly concerns Kinlo Strongarm and Mairee Silentone.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Telin Darkforest can be found near the zone to Skyfire Mountains. The easiest way to find him is to head to the North West 
part of the zone, towards Skyfire, and you should eventually pick him up on tracking.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">You say, 'hail Telin Darkforest'<BR>
Telin Darkforest looks at you serenely. 'Hello, wanderer.'<BR>
You say, 'what are you doing in this forest'<BR>
Telin Darkforest says 'Mighty this place must have been, once. Now scarred by hatred and suffering. I have been sent here seeking answers to 
problems not yet understood.<BR>
You say, 'what answers'<BR>
Telin Darkforest considers you for a few moments before speaking. 'A great evil walks across the land. The hand of some demon we don't yet 
know is twisting and polluting forests.'<BR>
You say, 'what evil'<BR>
Telin Darkforest says 'If I knew that, I wouldnt be here looking for answers. I would be elsewhere, looking for solutions. For now, I suspect much 
but know little.<BR>
You say, 'what do you suspect'<BR>
Telin Darkforest looks at you and sighs. 'The lands are changing. Beasts, large and small, have turned upon those who watched over them. Druids 
and rangers, worshippers of both Karana and Tunare, have reported a feeling of hatred throughout their once peaceful lands.'<BR>
You say, 'perhaps it is Innoruuk'<BR>
Telin Darkforest raises his eyebrow slightly and a subtle look of surprise creeps across his face. 'Innoruuk? Perhaps. Aye. It must be. Perhaps I 
knew and didn't want to consider the possibility. It must be this though, and some action will have to be taken.'<BR>
You say, 'what action should I take'<BR>
Telin Darkforest looks at you consideringly and then scribbles something quickly on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful enough. Perhaps you 
can help those who seek to protect nature's peace. Take this note. Deliver it only into the hands of Faelin Bloodbriar. Where you will find her, I 
cannot say. She is a friend of mine and a wanderer. She has been seen from one end of the lands to the other. Seek her out, and quickly.'</P>

<P CLASS="header1">Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark, Faydwer</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Faelin Bloodbriar spawns at POS 1500, POS 500 in Greater Faydark. Her placeholder is an orc pawn. Faelin is a rare spawn. 
Just hang around this area and kill all orc pawns you see around the area. Once you see either Faelin or an orc pawn spawn, you can procede to 
camp just that spot and not worry about additional orcs.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">Give Telin’s note to Faelin<BR>
Faelin Bloodbriar reads the note carefully and growls to herself. 'Bad news, eh? Take this ring. There is one elf, dark elf even, who we must go to 
in order to gather insight into Innoruuk's plans. Giz X'Tin, he goes by most commonly. Kithicor seems to be his favorite haunt and most likely you 
will find him there. Don't ask how I know him. Just take the ring as my sign to him and he will speak to you. We don't need to speak again, so 
dont seek me out, just goto Telin. I must leave to investigate these events.'</P>

<P CLASS="header1">Giz X`Tin in Kithicor Forest, Antonica</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Giz X'Tin is a wandering spawn that has been mostly seen towards the north end of the zone. He said to spawn around POS 
1000, POS 1500. It is known that he does wander the zone. I have seen hin on track durning the day and night time. The easiest way that I have 
found to find him is to run along the way between West Commons and Rivervale. If he is up, you will most likely pick him up on tracking. Most likely 
your faction with Giz X'Tin will not be high enough, cast Spirit of Wolf on yourself, run up behind him and sneak before you give him Faelin's 
Ring.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">Give Faelin’s Ring to Giz X'Tin<BR>
Giz X`Tin flips you a coin after he recognizes the ring. 'It seems we have a mutual 'acquaintance.' The coin repays an old debt. You don't have 
to worry about what that is. Luckily, Lord Innoruuk has informed me of your coming and your desires. Fortunately, I have all the answers you 
require right here at the end of my friend's blade. I think I'll be paying my old 'friend' a visit.'<BR>
Teir`Dal Reaver says 'Lord Innoruuk, I have failed you. Forgive me and spare me from service to your undead minions in the world!</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Giz X'Tin gives you a "Dark Metal Coin" to take to Telin Darkforest.</I></P>

some fun. He drops nothing and you already have the coin for the next part. The reaver is said to be level 50 exactly and tough to fight. I just 
got the coin and ran.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">Give coin to Telin<BR>
Telin Darkforest scratches the coin as he looks at it. 'Faelin sent you to Giz? Surprising. This coin speaks to the outcome of your talk. He would 
hardly give this bit of metal to a stranger, but that's a story for a different time. So, you say Giz did confirm Innoruuk's involvement, and 
something about undead minions? Here, take this coin back. Find Arch Druid Althele in the Karanas and show her that. Tell her what we have 
discussed. She will look kindly on an ally in this matter.'</P>

<P CLASS="header1">Althele in East Karana, Antonica</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>NOTE: Do not procede with this part until you are ready to deal with the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Dark Elf Reavers that 
will spawn. If you fail to kill the Dark Elf Corruptor you will have to the start quest over from the beginning. You will also want to check the spawn 
before proceeding. You should only see Tholris and Fang with Althele. If you see any of the other druids with Althele, then either someone is in the 
process of doing this part or the spawn is bugged. In cases when the spawn is bugged, you will need to wait for a server rest to be able to do 
this part of the quest.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Althele can be found close to the Barbarian Village around NEG 3650, NEG 1600. Tholris and Fang should also be there with 
her. If you see any of the other druids with her, do not give her the coin right away. First check to see if someone is currently in the process of 
doing this part of the quest. If this is the case, just wait for them to finish up. Althele, Tholris and Fang all respawn thirty minutes after all the 
druids have been despawned. The other possibility, is that someone had tried to do this part of the quest, failed and the spawn is messed up. If 
this is the case, you may have to wait for the server till after the server goes down again to be able to the quest.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">You say, 'hail Althele'<BR>
Althele says 'Hello, friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally but lately?<BR>
Give Coin to Althele<BR>
Althele looks at the coin and nods gravely at you as she slips it into a fold of her clothing. 'I see. The story of this coin speaks much to me as do 
the words you have given me. Telin sent word that you would arrive. The tidings you bring are ill indeed. Here, take this amulet and find Sionae. 
She is nearby. We will speak more on this matter when all are present.'</P>

Althele says 'Tholris does not speak much. He is here to assist me in my duties. He is my hands, as Fang is my eyes.<BR>
Fang barks in response to Althele's words.<BR>
You say, 'why do you need him as your hands and fang as your eyes?'<BR>
Althele says 'Yes. I cannot see any longer, my sight long since lost in the march of years. By the blessings of Tunare
and Karana, though, I still make myself useful.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I> Sionae spawns after you get the Braided Grass Amulet and can be found around NEG 2300, NEG 930.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">Give amulet to Sionae<BR>
Sionae says 'I see that the time has come. Take the amulet and give it to the third of our kin, Nuien. I will meet you at the gathering.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Sionae gives you a "Frayed Braided Grass Amulet" to take to Nuien, who spawns near NEG 3650, NEG 300.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>You need to move quickly to Nuien. People who are Kill on Sight to druids may walk past him because of where he spawns. 
If this happens, Nuien will argo on that person. I do not know if he will argo on any hostile mobs in the area, but it is best to move quickly and 
not take that chance. If Nuien is killed, the spawn will be messed up and you will have to start all over. Even if Nuien argos on someone, you can 
still give him the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet. He will then start walking to the gathering place and Teloa will spawn.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">Give amulet to Nuien<BR>
Nuien says 'So be it. Do as you have done before and find the next. Teloa is the last.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Nuien gives the "Frayed Braided Grass Amulet" back to you, and Teloa spawns near the waterfall around NEG 3800, NEG 
2860.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">Give amulet to Teloa<BR>
Teloa begins walking toward the gathering spot. 'Follow me to the gathering now.'</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Follow Teloa back to where Althele is, which is where the druids are gathering. You will not have the amulet at this point as 
she does not return it to you.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">Althele says 'Great mother of life and father of sky, growth and spirit, Tunare and Karana. Innoruuk once again schemes and 
we have failed in our duties to protect our land. We give our powers in sacrifice for your help. Heed our call and send us your wisdom.<BR>
Althele snaps her head towards you. 'Innoruuk's brood is upon us. Go, find the spawn of hatred before they reach this point and destroy 
them!'</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Dark Elf Corruptor and several Dark Reavers spawn, level supposed to be 50ish. Only the Corruptor is said to have to be 
killed. It is recommended that you root him, so he does not despawn on you. Additionally, it has been mentioned that he cannot be pulled, so 
you have to rush in and attack him.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">Dark Elf Corruptor shouts 'We come for you, fools. Your reign of weakness over the powers of the land comes to an end 
now!</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>The easist way to do this is to have two group of people waiting on the hill. The first group will attack the Dark Elf 
Corruptor immediately. The second group will kite the Dark Elf Reavers to keep them distracted until the Corruptor has been killed. Even though 
you will miss most [or all] of the fighting, you should be one of the people in the group killing the Corruptor just so that you will be able to loot 
his corpse right away and get the "Fleshbound Tomb."<BR>
Once the Dark Elf Corruptor is killed, the group killing the Corruptor will take out the reavers. Even though some advocate killing the corruptor and 
letting the reavers get the druids. I don't recommend this for several reasons. First off, it is not within the theme of the quest to let the druids 
get killed. Secondly, it is more time productive to kill the reavers also then turn in the Felshbound Tomb to Althele right away as you will have to 
wait longer to turn in the book.</I></P>

filth. You have only just begun your quest. The path you are guided upon will be difficult, if not impossible, but someone must finish it. Please,

<P CLASS="header1">Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket, Antonica</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Go to Misty Thicket and wait near the guards that are close to the zone to Rivervale. Ella Foodcrafter will run all over the 
zone. The wait usually isn't long, so it is easier to wait for her to come to the guards. She doesn't stay in one place for long, so you may want 
to bring along a friend to constantly hail until you give her the Earth Stained Note.</I></P>

"Essence Tamer," which is the mob that drops the Swirling Sphere of Color.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>The Plane of Air can only be reached by the Level 46 Wizard spell "Alter Plane: Sky." This spell does require a reagent to be

3rd floor of the City Library of Erudin and costs around 200-250PP depending on your faction.</I></P>

	<LI>This is the part which is potentially the most confusing for people. You will have two swords: Refined Ancient Sword and Refined Mithril 
		Blade. If you do not have both of these, see Expanded Final Part 1 to obtain them.</LI>
	<LI>Check the two refined swords, one should say "Ancient" in its name and the other should say "Mithril." Move the one that says "Ancient" 
		to a General inventory slot. Move the one that says "Mithril" to a container or equp it to move it out of the way.</LI>
	<LI>Double check that the only refined sword in your general inventory slot is the one with "Ancient" in its name. Now, give this sword to Telin 
		Darkforest.</LI>
	<LI>Faelin will spawn and the refined sword with the word "Ancient" in its name will be back in your inventory, in a general slot. Pick up the 
		sword and give it to Faelin.</LI>
	<LI>Faelin will despawn and give you Swiftwind.</LI>
	<LI>Now that you have Swiftwind, equip it.</LI>
</OL></P>

<P CLASS="header1">Expanded Final Part 3: Xanuusus</P>
<P CLASS="text"><OL>
	<LI>This part shouldn't give you any trouble. I am including it here, just in case.</LI>
	<LI>Make sure that you have the Refined Mithril Blade and Shattered Emerald of Corruption. If you are missing the Refined Mithril Blade, you 
		will want to see Expanded Final Part 1. If you are missing the Shattered Emerald of Corruption, you will need to attend a Plane of Hate 
		raid to obtain it.</LI>
	<LI>Just look in your inventory for the Shattered Emerald of Corruption and the refined sword with "Mithril" in its name. Give both of these 
		to Xanuusus to receive Earthcaller.</LI>
</OL></P>

<P CLASS="text">If you are still confused as to what to do at this point, my advise it to have another ranger who has done the Epic Quest 
already be there to coach you through the final turn ins. If you are on the Ayonae Ro server, you can give me a tell. Provided that I am not on 
a raid, I will come running over. If you play on another server and wish for me to be there to assist you with the turn ins, send me an email, and 
I will try to work something out with you to be there.</P>

<P CLASS="header1"><A NAME="faction">POSSIBLE FACTION ISSUES</A></P>

<P CLASS="text">These are listed in the order in which you may run into a faction issue.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Plane of Growth</B><BR>
Although the Plane of Growth is not used for the quest, it does need special mentioning.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Telin Darkforest [Faydark's Champion]</B><BR>
Telin Darkforest is on Faydark's Champion faction. Any of the Kelethin Ranger quests will give you faction with him. You can also kill orcs in 
Crushbone.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Faelin Bloodbriar and Foloal Stormforest [Soldiers of Tunare]</B><BR>
The only way to increase faction with either of these two NPCs is by doing quests for either the Kelethin Ranger or Druid guilds.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Giz X`Tin [unknown]</B><BR>
He is mostly be on one of the Dark Elf Factions and will probably be less than indifferent to you. If this is the case, cast Spirit of Wolf on yourself 
[to be able to keep up with him]  than sneak up behind him so that he will be indifferent to you and then give him the ring. If you give him the 
ring, while he /CONs dubious [or lower] to you, you will not get the coin to continue the quest.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Dark Elf Corruptor and Dark Reavers in East Karana [Dark Elf Warrior]</B><BR>
Killing them will not impact faction with the Neriak Guards. This faction will only be noteworthy to any Dark Elves [and to a lesser extent Trolls 
and Ogres] that may wish to assist you with killing these.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Alrik Farsight [Keepers of the Art]</B><BR>
To gain faction with Alrik Farsight, visit the Magician Guild in Felwithe [B] and give Niola Impholder Bat Wings until she is amiable to you. If your 
faction with Niola Impholder is so low that she doesn't give you faction when you turn them in, stand behind her and use sneak to make her 
indifferent to you.</P>

<P CLASS="text"><B>Kinlo Strongarm &amp; Usbak the Old [unknown]</B><BR>
If your faction with these dwarves is less than indifferent, you will need to stand behind them and use sneak in order to be able to deal with 
them.</P>
