<P>Feburary 1, 2003: Skies<BR>
Another update on the Skies of Arcadia faq. This time up through completing Galcia.</P>

<P>January: 26, 2003: Skies of Arcadia Legends<BR>
I'm just at the point where Vyse meets Gilder on replaying this game and have updated the faq to be good through to this point.</P>

<P>January 20, 2003: A few updates<BR>
The half elf fashion table has been renamed to the "Equipment RGB Colors" 

<P>January 19, 2003: Revised Site Uploaded<BR>
The gallery was changed... again, as well as some other areas this time as well. I will be back to regular updates

<P>December 28, 2003: Bleah...<BR>
Revamp complete... Unfortunately, I am no longer interested in maintaining a 100% EQ website at this point. Sure I still play the game, 
but constantly pushing myself to find something new for the site is cutting into my enjoyment. Taking screen shots that I really don't have 
the web space for doesn't help and doing quests just for the sake of doing them to cover on the site really isn't fun for me anymore. Most 
games for my console systems remain unfinished if even started as I never have time to play them...<BR>
As such, the site is going through some major changes to accomondate other games that I am interested in as I play them in addition to 
EverQuest. The informational sections of the site still remain, but the gallery as it last was is completely gone to be replaced by something 
new and different. The "profile" area has become more of a status report of where I am at with the various games I am playing.</P>

<P>December 4, 2003: Gallery Change<BR>
Unfortunately even after a lot of cutting, the image gallery is still taking up excessive amounts of server space. Because of this, I have 
decided to completely retire the gallery in its current form and will be replacing it with something new!</P>

<P>November 30, 2003: Gallery Update - Luclin<BR>
I reuploaded all the images for the remaining galleries and noticed that the menu images for the Luclin gallery were already completely, so 
I finished off this gallery. The Antonica gallery will be back online soon. I just need some time to run around and take the screen shots that 
I use for the menu.</P>

<P>November 22, 2003: Gallery Update - Faydwer<BR>
The Faydwer gallery is back online! I am going to next concentrate on getting a bunch of inventory screen shots for finished backing 
recipes added as it really isn't fun to let them pile up too much. Once this batch is done, I'll start working on the Antonica gallery as well 
as adding more images to the half elf fashion table.</P>

<P>November 21, 2003: Resources Update - Half Elf Fashion Table<BR>
I reworked the half elf fashion table and gave it its own option on the drop down menu. The screen shot for Petrified Bark Leggings was 
removed as it didn't fit the format that I intended. However I added a bunch of full sets of ranger armor. Since I was able to obtain a 
near complete set of Engraved Royal Velium Armor, I was able to start work on Velious-style plate armor and added Rizlona's Fiery Armor 
as well. The Faydark gallery is almost ready. I've finished my reevaluation of all my old screen shots and am almost done with the LDON 
ones. I expect this to be back online sometime tomorrow, time permitting.</P>

<P>November 20, 2003: Gallery Update - Planes<BR>
The gallery covering planar zones has been reuploaded. For space purposes, I have cut all non-named mobs and miscellaneous zone 
pictures. Some lesser named mobs have been cut as well in some cases. I've also started adding inventory screen shots for finished baked 
items. Several were added yesterday, and I took some more screen shots for this project today. I'm also reworking the half elf fashion table 
a bit, and plan to add it to the main drop down menu under resources during the next update. The Faydark gallery is also being worked on 
at the moment.</P>

<P>November 17, 2003: General Update Complete<BR>
The site is back online for the most part. Galleries are undergoing evaluation at the moment but will be back shortly. I plan to evaluate 
the section covering planes first as they were taking up the most space. Antonica and Faydark will come next due to containing the Lost 
Dungeons of Norrath zones. Oddly enough while uploading today, I ran into the Shadowed Leader so will be adding the Orc Impaler quest to 
the site after the gallery is back online.</P>
