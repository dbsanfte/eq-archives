<P><B>Ivy Etched Sleeves</B></P>

<P>This quest is given by Gandari in the Kithikor Woods Ranger Guild. The key phrase to trigger the quest is 'I am interested in Sleeves.'</P>

<P>Items for this quest:<UL>
	<LI>Rune of Ivy [Left]</LI>
	<LI>Heart of Fire</LI>
	<LI>2 Star Rubies</LI>
</UL></P>

<P><B>Rune of Ivy [Left]</B></P>

<P>The Rune of Ivy [Left] drops off GrimFeather in North Karana. All mobs in this zone are on the same spawn table, so just keep killing stuff 
until it spawns. One nice thing about this area though is that you can hunt Highland Lions for High Quality Lion Skins [needed for Fleeting 
Quivers] and bears for High Quality Bear Skins [needed for 10-slot backpacks] while you are hunting GrimFeather. I have seen GrimFeather 
spawn somewhat regularly when I go lion hunting. As far as I can tell, the Rune of Ivy will drop every time. I have yet to see a GrimFeather 
without one.</P>

<P><B>Heart of Fire</B></P>

<P>The Heart of Fire drops off of Inferno Goblin Wizards in Solusek's Eye [aka Sol A] They look deceptively easy. The first time I attempted 
this it was me and a L50 Necromancer [who was an ex-ranger] hanging out in the bar. To make a long story short, the wizards nuked us both 
down fast since we were over-confident and cocky. We were soon seeking rezes. Resistance gear is highly recommended. They are most 
commonly seen in the bar area, which is deep enough that you don't want any adds.</P>

<P>Should you end up with a train, the area near the entrance can be tricky if you have not run up and down it many times. Falling here can 
result in some nasty corpse retrivals. [Yes, I even feel to my death in the lava trying to get away from a train we made, so I am speaking 
from experience here.] Should you fall in this area, corpses are hard to drag out of the lava. I recommend just dying some place more 
convient to save yourself the hastle of seeking out someone who can summon dead bodies.</P>
