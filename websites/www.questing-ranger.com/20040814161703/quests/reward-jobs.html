Location: Song Runes, Buburimu Peninsula [F-9]<BR>
Requirements: Level 30+<BR>
Items: Parchment<BR>
Reward: Poetic Parchment</P>

<P>This quest actually starts with Mertaire at the Merry Minstrel Meadhouse in Lower Jeuno. After you talk to him, talk to Bki Tbujhja who mentions the Song Runes. You will 
now want to travel to the Song Rune in Buburimu Peninsula. On the Khoonta Dunes, there is a cave at [G-9] that leads to another beach area. You will need to check this 
beach for a second cave [F-9], which is where the Song Rune is located. Click on it to meet with Lewenhart, then trade the parchment to the Song Runes to get Poetic 
Parchment. If you didn't bring parchment with you, it can be bought at auction houses as well as the Tanners' Guild in San d'Oria.</P>

<P><B>A Minstrel in Despair</B> [Bard Part 3]<BR>
Client: Mertaire<BR>
Location: Merry Minstrel Meadhouse, Lower Jeuno [I-8]<BR>
Requirements: The Old Monument<BR>
Items: Poetic Parchment<BR>
Reward: 2,100 gil</P>

<P>Once you have the poetic parchment, return to Mertaire and give it to him.</P>

<P><B>Path of the Bard</B> [Bard Part 3]<BR>
Client: Lewenhart<BR>
Location: Song Runes, Valkurm Dunes [C-6]<BR>
Requirements: A Minstrel in Despair<BR>
Items: none<BR>
Reward: 3,000 gil, Bard Job<BR>
Title: Wandering Minstrel</P>

<P>Talk to Bki Tbujhja again to learn of the second Song Rune in Valkurm Dunes. You will now want to travel to Valkurm Dunes and head to [C-6] and look for a cave. On the 
other side of the cave is the "secret" beach. Follow the wall to the left to find the second Song Rune. Click on it to unlock the Bard job.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Save My Son</B> [Beastmaster]<BR>
Client: Dietmund<BR>
Location: Merchant's House, Lower Jeuno [G-11]<BR>
Requirements: Chocobo's Wounds, Level 30+<BR>
Reward: Beast Whistle, 2100 gil, Beastmaster Job</P>

<P>You'll want to head to the area around F-8 in Qufim Island. Look for a ramp that heads downward along the edge of the cliff. Once here, go down a bit but not all the way. 
You will now want to wait until the time is somewhere between 20:00 and 4:00 as this is when the flower will be in full bloom. You will need to use Sneak at this point in order 
to get by the Kraken safely. Double-click on the "Night Flowers" to start the intermission. Afterwards, you will want to head back to Dietmund's house, then talk to Brutus at 
the Chocobo Stable in Upper Jeuno.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Ayame and Kaede</B> [Ninja]<BR>
Client: Ensetsu<BR>
Location: Hose, Port Bastok [I-5]<BR>
Items: Strangely-Shapped Coral, Sealed Dagger [key items]<BR>
Reward: Ninja Job<BR>
Title: Shadow Walker</P>

<P>This quest starts by talking to Kaede, who is in the same house as Ensetsu. After you talk to her, talk to Ensetsu. At this point, you are ready for the leech fight in the 
Korroloka Tunnel. To get there, enter from Bastok side then go straight ahead until you reach [K-8] then turn left. Continue along until you come to a bridge at [G-9] then 
cross over it. After you cross the bridge, go left until you reach another junction at [D-8]. You will want to go right here. Just follow the path from here until you get to [H-8] 
then go left. Enter the cave to the left at [F-9] then follow the patch straight ahead and dont cross the bridge. Continue to follow the patch until you reach [H-11] and go 
right. Keep going straight and cross the next bridge. Continue on then go right at [H-8], and right again at [I-7]. Just follow the path from here and there will be a "???" at the 
end of it at [K-8]. Also at some point in here, you will start to see jellies along the path, which you can get buy with Sneak. After the jellies it will appear to be clear a bit, but 
you will run into Bogies. Sneak will get you past these also. Additionally be very careful not to fall off the bridges as you pretty much will die if Sneak and Invisible both are not 
up due to the high level mobs down below.</P>

<P>Clear out all nearby leeches before triggering the fight as they will link with the ones you are fighting and agro on you. Once your party is ready for the actual fight, have the 
person that you want to tank investigate the ??? spot to trigger the leeches. If possible, you should have someone sleep or lullaby two of them. This fight can be hard but is not 
nearly as hard as everyone makes it out to be. Once all three leeches are dead, investigate the "???" spot a second time to get the Strangely-Shapped Coral.</P>

<P>You will now want to go back to Port Bastok and talk to Ensetsu again. He will want you to deliver the coral for him to Norg. While I don't have directions for getting there, 
you can ride a chocobo to Sea Serpent Grotto, which will get you there safely. Once inside Sea Serpent Grotto, you will want to have Sneak up constantly. At this point, just 
follow the path straight ahead until you reach a point that you have to turn left or right. Go right and there will be an unmarked door. Click on the door to open it then go 
straight ahead from here to get to Norg.</P>

<P>Inside Norg, talk to Ryoma, who you will find near the dock. Once this is done, return to Port Bastok and talk to Ensetsu for the ninja job.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>A Squire's Test</B> [Paladin Part 1]<BR>
Client: Balasiel<BR>
Location: Watchdog Alley, South San d'Oria [F-7]<BR>
Items: Revival Root<BR>
Reward: Spatha</P>

<P>This is the first of three quests that must be completed in order to eventually unlock the paladin job. While the quest specifies King Ranperre's Tomb, the root is a rare drop 
off any undead anywhere. [I got mine from a Tainted Hound in Konschtat Highlands.] They call also be purchased at the auction house under materials.</P>

<P><B>A Squire's Test II</B> [Paladin Part 2]<BR>
Client: Balasiel<BR>
Location: Watchdog Alley, South San d'Oria [F-7]<BR>
Requirements: A Squire's Test<BR>
Items: Stalactite Dew<BR>
Reward: Squire's Certificate<BR>
Title: Spelunker</P>

<P>If you talk to Chanpau, near Balasiel, he'll suggest that you bring back stalactite dew. You'll want to go to the Cathedral in North San d'Oria at this point to talk to Morjean 
to learn how to get it. At this point you will want to head to Ordelle's Caves. In the first room, you will want to follow the winding path that is towards the right until you come 
to a room with a bunch of Fungars. There are a bunch of them and they will agro even at L30, even though most of the stuff in the cave will not at this point. I used Sneak, 
buch if you are not playing a mage class you will need either items that will give you this ability or maybe a few friends to help you clear through them.</P>

<P>There are now two paths that you can take. If you have a map, take the one that doesn't lead towards La Theine to get to the room with a pool of water. Make sure that 
sneak is still up as there are more fungars here also. You'll want to get close to the water to touch it, then check the stalactites in the room that are a bit away from the pool. 
One of them will be targetable and if you are fast enough, you will get the dew after having touched the water. Once you have the dew, just bring it back to Balasiel.</P>

<P><B>A Knight's Test</B> [Paladin Part 3]<BR>
Client: Balasiel<BR>
Location: Watchdog Alley, South San d'Oria [F-7]<BR>
Requirements: A Squire's Test II, Level 30+<BR>
Items: Book of Tactics, Book of the West, Book of the East, Knight's Soul<BR>
Reward: Kite Shield, Paladin Job<BR>
Title: Tried and Tested Knight</P>

<P>At this point, you will want to talk to the guards in the towers overlooking Victory Square in South San d'Oria. You can find the entrance to the East Tower at [L-8], where 
you will talk to Cahaurme for the Book of the East. The entrance for the West Tower is at [G-9], which leads to Baurise, who gives you the Book of the West. The guards may 
be talked to in either order.</P>

<P>Once this is done, you need to head to E-10 in Davoi. Having the map for this area will help a lot as you will need to walk through some water. If you are doing this solo, 
keep invisibility up at all times as all orcs and pugil will agro. Around the well itself, you may see a slim type mob. This will detect by sound or smell but not sight. If there is no 
orc nearby, find a good spot to put up these two buffs then head for the well to get the Knight's Soul. If there is an orc around the well in addition to the slime, you may want 
to try waiting for the orc to look the other way to drop invisibility or even eat a death to get the key item. Regardless of how you get it, return to Balasiel afterwards to get a 
Kite Shield and the ability to select the paladin job.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>The Fanged One</B> [Ranger]<BR>
Client: Perih Vashai<BR>
Location: Vashai's Residence, Windurst Woods [K-7]<BR>
Requirements: Level 30+<BR>
Items: Old Tiger Fang<BR>
Reward: Ranger's Necklace, Ranger Job<BR>
Title: The Fanged One</P>

<P>For this quest, you need to journey to the cave in the Sauromugue Champaign at [L-10]. If you enter the zone from Meriphataud Montains, as if coming from Windurst, 
follow the wall to your right until you reach a point that will allow you to go to the upper level area then head to the cave at [L-10]. Also the best way to do this part of the 
quest is to come here by chocobo as the tigers in and around the cave will not agro you will you are riding one. The chocobo will enter this cave, so take it to the back to 
where there is a tiger skeleton on the ground.</P>

<P>At this point, you will want to wait for all the tigers to leave then get off the chocobo. You may want to check the bones now to see if you can get the Old Tiger Fang. If 
not, just invis yourself and wait for the named tiger to die naturally. When you do get the fang, invis yourself and leave the cave.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Forge Your Destiny</B> [Samurai]<BR>
Client: Jaucribaix<BR>
Location: Near Captain's Quarters, Norg [K-8]<BR>
Requirements: Level 30+<BR>
Items: Sacred Sprig, Oriental Steel, Bomb Steel, Sacred Branch<BR>
Reward: Mumeito, Samurai Job<BR>
Title: Bushido Blade</P>

<P>The two purplis you need to talk to are Ranemaud and Aeka, who give you a sacred sprig and oriental steel. Afterwards you have two triggered boss fights to complete. For 
the bomb steel, you will want to go to Konschtat Highlands to the cave at [D-8] and trade the oriental steel to the unidentified point. This will trigger Forger, who drops the 
bomb steel. For the sacred branch, you need to go to the east end of Zi'tah Sanctuary [L-10] and loook for a giant tree. Use a hatchet here to trigger the fight with the 
Guardian Treant. With this out of the way, you can trade the sacred sprig to the unidentified point to get the sacred branch.</P>

<P>Once you have both items, return to Jaucribaix and give them to him. You will now need to wait three ingame days [3 hours] for him to make the sword. Once it is 
completed, Jaucribaix will give you mumeito and the ability to select the samurai job.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>I Can Hear a Rainbow</B> [Summoner]<BR>
Client: ???<BR>
Location: House of the Hero, Windurst Walls [G-3]<BR>
Requirements: Carbuncle's Ruby, Level 30+<BR>
Reward: Summoner Job, Carbuncle<BR>
Title: Rainbow Weaver</P>

<P>The first thing you need to do for this quest is get the ruby, which is a rare/ex drop off leeches. The leeches that drop them with the highest frequency are the ones in 
Qufim Island. Even then, you'll want to bring as many people as you can with the Treasure Hunter ability. [I had an alliance with seven people, two of which had treasure hunter, 
when I finally got the ruby.] However for these leeches, you'll need to be L45+ if you are trying to do it solo or L30+ with a small group. If these leeches are not an option for 
you, the next best place to go is Burburimu Peninsula. If you do go here instead, you need to bring someone with Treasure Hunter. If you cannot, then you should go level a 
thief to 15 and subjob it. Without having someone there with this ability, I must have spent between 15-20 hours there in total, and did not get the ruby. Once you finally 
have the ruby, you will want to go to the House of the Hero in Windurst Walls. After a brief intermission, you will need to collect the seven colors of the rainbow. While I am 
listing them in their rainbow color order, you can gather the colors in any order.</P>

<P>Red [Hot Spells]<BR>
Recommended Areas: Eastern Altepa Desert<BR>
The Eastern Altepa Desert might be a bit tough to get through at Level 30, but it is very doable if you have a mage job. First you will want to head out to Bastok then enter 
the Zeruhn Mines [which i accessable from either Bastok Mines or Palborough Mines] then head straight through to the Korroloka Tunnel. The route through the Korroloka 
Tunnel is a straight run though, but you will need to have sneak and invisibility up at all times. Once you get to the Eastern Altepa Desert, just around for a hot spell to 
occur if it is not already. Once you see the hot spell, just zone back to the tunnel then to the desert to get the red light.</P>

<P>Orange [Sunshine]<BR>
Recommended Areas: any<BR>
This one should be fairly easy to get as clear sunny skies can occur almost anywhere.</P>

<P>Yellow [Sand Storms]<BR>
Recommended Areas: Valkurm Dunes, Konschtat Highlands<BR>
Sand storms occur frequently in both of these two areas. You can even wait by the zone for these as they are next to each other and move over to the other periodically. 
Though I would recommend spending most of your time in Konschtat Highlands as it can get thunder storms as well.</P>

<P>Green [Wind]<BR>
Recommended Area: La Theine Plateau<BR>
While there are other areas that are just as good, La Theine has several benefits. One being that if  you collected the "hard" ones already, the remaining ones can all be collected 
near by. You can get water as well in La Theine, while Valkurn Dunes has sand storms and Jugner Forest can get thunder.</P>

<P>Blue [Rain]<BR>
Recommended Area: Pashhow Marshlands<BR>
While there are other places that are also good for rain, the Pashhow Marshlands experiences rain far more than any other weather condition to the point that it will most likely 
be raining when you first come in.</P>

<P>Indigo [Snow]<BR>
Recommended Area: Beaucedine Glacier<BR>
This one will seem difficult as you need to navigate your way through Ranguemont Pass and without a map. Unfortunately it is rather easy to walk in circles and hit dead ends. 
If you are doing this at Level 30, you will not need sneak or invisibility right away. Also make sure that you bring a Scroll of Instant Warp because after you pass a paticular point, 
you cannot turn around and go back. At the first intersection in Ranguemont Pass, go right. This will take you to a room with two elvaan in it. Talk to the one in front of a 
pedistal, who will open the door for you. After you go through this door, you will need to cast sneak and invisibility immediately. You can also not go back through the door after 
it closes behind you. Once you are through the door, continue straight ahead. The first intersection [E-9] will have a path leading straight ahead and one to the left. You will 
want to take the one straight ahead which will lead you to a large room. After the large room, you will come to another intersection [G-8] that forces you to go left or right. 
Take a left turn here. From this point onward, just follow the right wall. There will be two more intersections at [G-7] and [L-6] where you can go straight ahead or turn left, 
but you will want to continue straight. The zone to Beaucedine Glacier will be at [L-4]. Apparently it always snows out here, so you will get the indigo light immedately. You'll 
need to activate the Scroll of Instant Warp at this point in order to get back.</P>

<P>Violet [Thunder]<BR>
Recommended Areas: Konschtat Highlands, Pashhow Marshlands<BR>
Another spot to look for thunder is Jugner Forest. However Konschtat and Pashhow are right next to each other thus allowing you to wait by the boundry and periodically check 
the other area.</P>
