<P><B>Dynasty Warriors 3 Survival Guide FAQ</B><BR>
by Crydee Ossiriand<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.questing-ranger.com">http://www.questing-ranger.com</A><BR>
Version: 2004.05.02</P>

<P>This FAQ specifically is a walkthrough for getting the "Survival Guide" item using Free Mode. It might seem like an odd thing to write a FAQ on. After having 
to redo the fight several times to trigger the event and take out Sima Yi before Zhuge Liang gets himself killed, I decided to write it.</P>

<P>Requirements:<BR>
Stage: Wu Zhang Plains, Shu Side<BR>
After two of your tiger generals are defeated, there will be a Shooting Star event followed by a Special Item Report.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Preparations</B></P>

<P>Part 1 - Difficulty Setting:<BR>
This can be activated with all difficulty settings. However you will need to let some of your officers die, which will increase the morale of all enemies that will 
be swarming on you by the time the special item is activated. I decided to go with the easy setting because of this. The downside to using easy is you will 
have a thirty minute wait before the event triggers. The advantage to using easy is that enemy morale will be high afterwards regardless of difficulty, and it 
will be easier to fix this as you will still need to finish the stage.</P>

<P>Part 2 - Choosing Your Officer::<BR>
I would recommend using Zhuge Liang if you are good at him. Since he is the leader of the Shu side for this battle, playing as Zhuge Liang allows you to 
control what he is doing and make sure that he doesn't die thus cause you to lose. You do not want to play as Jiang Wei or any of the Shu Tiger generals. 
Jiang Wei will be guarding the left side of Shu headquarters and help slow down their advancement on Zhuge Liang should you not be playing as him. Since 
any two of the Tiger generals need to die to trigger the item, playing as one just reduces the number of possible people to die.</P>

<P>If you are not good at Zhuge Liang or have not built him up, go with any officer you are good at [minus those I recommend not using.] This will result in 
you controlling an extra officer in a sense as your officer will appear as a sub-general under Zhuge Liang's command.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Triggering the Special Item Report</B></P>

<P>At this point you are ready to start the battle. The first thing you will want to do is take out Cao Ren, who is located at the Catapults to the Lower-Left 
to prevents the second catapult attack. The morale hit to Shu officers take for the second attack will not cause them die any faster in this case and just 
leaves your headquarters especially vulnerable. Once this is done, head back to Shu Headquarters and find a nice spot along the right side somewhere that is 
a bit away from everything and wait for the first catapult attack.</P>

<P>After the first catapult attack passes, you will now want to start guarding the right side of Shu Headquarters at the base of the final ramp leading up. 
You'll want to kill all enemies, officer or not, that gets close. If there are no enemies around, just wait. When you get to about 60 minutes left in the fight, 
the first tiger general should die and another should die a few minutes afterwards. This will trigger the special item report, which should be fairly close to 
where you are waiting.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Winning the Stage</B></P>

<P>Once you obtain the Survival Guide, you will still need to win the stage. Start killing off Wei officers at this point as they will eventually start moving on 
Shu Headquarters. Huang Zhong should be able to hold off the regular enemies enough to keep Zhug Liang safe if you are not playing him, with the officers 
dead. Keep in mind though that after you kill the last Wei officer so that only Sima Yi and Zhang Fei are left, Zhuge Liang will decide to make a move on Wei 
headquarters if you are not playing him. [The music will change to signify this.] You will want to head straight for Wei Headquarters at this point. If you pass 
along the base in front of Sima Yi, your officer will taunt Sima Yi and cause him to take a morale hit. You'll want to take Zhang Fei out first just to get him out 
of the way. Once Sima Yi is defeated, the battle will be over and the Survival Guide along with anything else you picked up will be processes. Make sure that 
you save otherwise you will have to redo the battle.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>My Officer</B></P>

<P>In case you're wondering, I used Lu Xun for this and his stats were as follows:<BR>
* Class: Max<BR>
* Stats: all very high, but not maxed yet<BR>
* Weapon: Eagle [Attack +42, Max Hits 6] Luck +10<BR>
* Items:<BR>
- The Art of War<BR>
- Wind Scroll: Reach +5<BR>
- Speed Scroll: Speed +8<BR>
- Tiger Amulet: Attack +8<BR>
- Shell Armor: Bow Defense: +16</P>
