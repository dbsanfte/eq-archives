<P><B>Star of Eyes FAQ</B><BR>
by Crydee Ossiriand, Torvonnilous Server<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.questing-ranger.com">http://www.questing-ranger.com</A><BR>
Version: 2004.06.01</P>

<P>The Star of Eyes is actually a secondary reward of the Staff of the Wheel / Ice Comet Quest. The significance of this item is that it has an infinate 
number of charages of identify. Since rangers do not get the actual spell, this item does have uses when trying to solve an unknown quests to gain insight 
of the item's possible purpose. For example, using Identify on the Shiny Tin Bowl that is part of the epic quest would tell you that it is "Ellas Reflective Tin 
Bowl." This might not seem important at first, but it should when you find yourself looking for a mirror of some sort.</P>

<P>To use the Star of Eyes to identify an item you own:<UL>
	<LI>Have yourself targeted</LI>
	<LI>Place the Star of Eyes in a Main Inventory Slot</LI>
	<LI>Pick up the item you want identifyed so that it is on your cursor</LI>
	<LI>Right click on the Star of Eyes with the item still on your cursor</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>You can also identify items on other players by having them hold the item on their cursor then target that person and right-click on the Star of Eyes. 
The person holding the item will get the message about the item's lore and not yourself.</P>

<P>There are no special faction requirements as the only NPC you need to talk to [Sulgar] is on Beta Neutral faction and should be indifferent to you 
regardless on any transgressions.</P>

<HR>

<P><B><A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('a_rod-old')">The Rods</A></B></P>

<P>There are ten Rods that you must obtain. Each rode will either be found underwater or require you to travel through water in order to get to it. The 
spells Enduring Breath and Camoflage [or Superior Camoflage] will help out a lot. All rods will require one or both of these spells to obtain them. All rods will 
be called "A Rod," so it will be necessary to remember which ones that you have obtained.</P>

<P>A Rod [Azia]<BR>
<CENTER><I>In the crossing<BR>
Of the waters<BR>
Rests a ship,<BR>
On its side<BR>
Drown sailors<BR>
Swim around it<BR>
Past this ship<BR>
The Azia lies.</I></CENTER></P>

<P>This rod is located underwater in Erud's Crossing at NEG 1162, POS 2340. There is a sunking boat with some zombie sailors hanging around it. You will 
need to go past this and into the deep area. There have been many reports of sharks in this area, both by other websites and message board postings. I 
also received some warnings about it before I went out there thus why I tried to seek out some information on them. Some report sharks that see though 
invisibility, while other says that they do not. When I actually went out there to get the rod, I confirmed the presence of sharks in the area that showed up 
on tracking. However, I never actually encountered any of them.</P>

<P>A Rod [Beza]<BR>
<CENTER><I>In the land<BR>
Of wind and snow<BR>
This stream of water<BR>
Does not flow<BR>
Below the ice<BR>
Upon dry land<BR>
The Beza rests<BR>
Held by no hand</I></CENTER></P>

<P>This rod is located in a building in the caves in Everfrost. Head over to the river to one of the holes in the ice. Go into the hole and swim North. Since 
you will not be able to gain air while swimming under the ice, Enduring Breath may help. When you reach dry land, you will be inside the Ice Cave. Keep 
heading right in the passage until you come to a building. The rod will be on the ground inside the building.</P>

<P>A Rod [Caza]<BR>
<CENTER><I>In the Lake of Rathe<BR>
An island looms<BR>
It hides a treasure<BR>
In its womb<BR>
A stone tower<BR>
Protected sleeps<BR>
Those who guard it<BR>
Can not weep</I></CENTER></P>

<P>This rod is located at the top of underwater tower in Lake Rathetear. Head to the Flame Tower in Lake Rathetear. Underwater towards the side facing 
to the arena zone there will be a tunnel. You will need to cast Enduring Breath on yourself at this point. If Deep is on tracking, you can use her to find the 
tower easy. Deep is a non-argo NPC for the monk epic quest who spawns at the underwater tower. The goblins around her did see through invisibility initially, 
but did see me after I picked up the rod.</P>

<P>A Rod [Dena]<BR>
<CENTER><I>A cauldron stews<BR>
But does not boil<BR>
Its edges rock<BR>
Not dirt of soil<BR>
Inside the cauldron<BR>
Lurks a door<BR>
The Dena lies<BR>
Some paces score</I></CENTER></P>

<P>This rod is located underwater in Dagnor's Cauldron at NEG 890, NEG 740. The easiest way to find this rod is to head towards Unrest, then swim 
underwater near the bottom to NEG 890, NEG 740. Enduring Breath may or may not be needed here depending on how long it takes you to find it.</P>

<P>A Rod [Ena]<BR>
<CENTER><I>Once Trolls did live<BR>
Within these halls<BR>
Then vengeance struck<BR>
Their might did fall<BR>
A well of water<BR>
Upsidown<BR>
The Ena rests<BR>
Yet does not drown</I></CENTER></P>

<P>This rod is located in Reanimated Hand Room in Lower Guk. I found this to be the hardest piece to get. This was partially because I do not know Lower 
Guk well do to having never hunted there regularly, especially the undead side. Luckly a paladin casted Invisibility versus Undead on me then guided me to 
the water passage leading to the hand room. We then killed off the hand and the froglok. The rod itself was a bit hard to notice, but can be found towards 
the right side of the room, near the water.</P>

<P>A Rod [Fana]<BR>
<CENTER><I>The tears of marr<BR>
A pool make<BR>
Two towers stand<BR>
Within this lake<BR>
In one tower<BR>
Guarded high<BR>
The Fana dreams<BR>
Of sleeping dry</I></CENTER></P>

<P>This rod is located underwater in the Oasis of Marr at the top of a tower. In the lake of the Oasis of Marr, there is a tower underwater. You will find it 
underwater slightly to the South-West of the spectre island. Although there are some aqua goblins around the tower and "guarding" this piece, they did not 
see me approach the tower or attack me after I picked up the rod.</P>

<P>A Rod [Geza]<BR>
<CENTER><I>Upon the mountain<BR>
Through the pass<BR>
The Tiger Roars<BR>
With eyes of glass<BR>
The Tiger sees<BR>
The waters fall<BR>
Geza is held<BR>
Under its thrall</I></CENTER></P>

<P>This rod is located underwater in Highpass Hold. There two waterfalls near the Tiger's Roar Inn. You will find the rod next to one of them.</P>

<P>A Rod [Heda]<BR>
<CENTER><I>Under this city<BR>
Upon the coast<BR>
Tunnels stretch<BR>
And secrets boast<BR>
Two dark pits<BR>
Within the ground<BR>
Fins circle Heda<BR>
Round and round</I></CENTER></P>

<P>This rod is located in the shark pit in Qeynos Aqueducts. I cannot really give you any special advise here. If you do not know how to find the shark pit, 
a map is highly recommended. Most things in the Qeynos Aqueducts do not see though invisibility spell, including the sharks, though I did once run into a 
Spectre on my way there. I have no idea where that came and have not noticed one on tracking since.</P>

<P>A Rod [Izah]<BR>
<CENTER><I>Under the Mountain<BR>
Where the sunless mass<BR>
The Blind Fish swims<BR>
With eyes of glass<BR>
The Blind Fish sees<BR>
Through azure haze<BR>
The Izah rests<BR>
Within its gaze</I></CENTER></P>

<P>This rod is located underwater near "The Blind Fish" bar in Neriak. Unless you are planning a Neriak raid, camoflage will be necessary for this one. The first 
part of Neriak is the Foreign Quarter and from there, you can get to the Neriak Commons. Shortly after you arrive in the commons, you will see the Priest of 
Dischord. Jump into the water near him and swim around until you see four windows underwater. The rod will be underwater in front of the windows.</P>

<P>A Rod [Jaka]<BR>
<CENTER><I>"Upon this house<BR>
Was laid a Doom<BR>
Its owners rise<BR>
From beyond the tomb<BR>
Now sunken is<BR>
A Dwarven crest<BR>
Where the Jaka lies<BR>
But can not rest"</I></CENTER></P>

<P>This rod is located underwater to the right of the house in Estate of Unrest. From the front side of the house, head right to the water. There are two 
tunnels entrance ways. To the left, will lead you to Spelunker. To the right, will lead you to the rod.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Star of Eyes</B></P>

<P>After you have found all ten of the rods, go the Everfrost.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Sulgar'<BR>
Sulgar says 'Hail Traveler. Would you happen to know the location of any of the spokes of [Tartons Wheel]?</P>

<P>You say, 'What is tartons wheel'<BR>
Sulgar says 'Tartons Wheel was a device that Tarton constructed to let him travel througth the planes. If you were [interested] in helping me reassemble it, 
I would [reward] you well.</P>

<P>You say, 'I am interested'<BR>
Sulgar says 'Tartons Wheel was split into 10 seperate pieces. These pieces were then scattered across the face of Norrath. I have a [tome] that I can 
[give] you detailing the Wheel of Tarton, as well as a [Wheel Case] that you can have when you are ready to assemble the pieces.</P>

<P>You say, 'Will you give me the tome?'<BR>
Sulgar says 'This Tome details the Wheel of Taron, and the lore on where the pieces of it can be found. Use it in good faith.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What wheel case?'<BR>
Sulgar says 'I will lend you this Wheel Case - put the ten spokes of the Wheel in it when you have collected them. I did say lend, however. I shall need the 
case back. Once you have constructed the Staff of the Wheel and the Star of Eyes, I will trade you them for a Rune of Frost and a Rune of the Astral.<BR>
*Sulgar gives you <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('a_glowing_case-old')">A glowing chest</A>.*</P>

<P>"A Glowing Case" is a 10-slot and No Rent container, so you will need to make sure that you have all the rods before doing anything with the Glowing 
Case. Place each of the ten rods in the case, then press the combine button to get the Staff of the Wheel [which can be destroyed if you are not actually 
doing the quest to get Ice Comet] and the <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('star_of_eyes-old')">Star of Eyes</A>.</P>

<P><B>Credits</B></P>

<P>Special thanks goes to Orun Dreamstalker for helping me find my way through Lower Guk. It is doubtful that I would have finished this quest at all if not 
for his guidance.</P>
