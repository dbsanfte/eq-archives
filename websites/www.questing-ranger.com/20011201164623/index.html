<P CLASS="header2">News</P>

<P CLASS="header1">November 25, 2001: quests section updates STILL in progress</P>
<P CLASS="text">A bunch of new gallery pictures were added today! I also updated my character stats. The quest section is still underway, 
and I expect to be making uploads to that later this week. I have been pushing hard to make L60, which gave me less time than I would like 
to update my website. Expect updates to occur more regularly after I get the updated quest area online and level again.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">October 24, 2001: quests section updates STILL in progress</P>
<P CLASS="text">The quest section is proving to be very time consuming to update. I just made some quick updates to the links and contact 
pages. I am tossing out a lot of my preliminary work for the revised quest area as this is proving to be a lot of work and will be a headache 
to maintain, instead of simplifying the section as I hoped. I just finished up some long overdue gallery updates, so will return to revising the 
quest section.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">October 16, 2001: quests section updates in progress</P>
<P CLASS="text">I'm currently working on updates to the quests section of my site. I just completed research on finding links to what I 
consider to be the best maps for each zone. Ok, some zones I can't find maps for and others the maps are so bad that no self respecting
ranger would use them. Anyway, these are all offsite links. I have no intention of starting a map archive myself, but if I make map 
references, these are the ones I go by. My next task for this area is the update the loc guide, which is going to be a subsection of the 
map area. This is all offline at the moment. I'll try to get some more work done tonight on it.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">October 13, 2001: site update in progress</P>
I'm working on a big update of the site right now. At the moment, I am uploading stuff for Crydee's portion of the site then will move on to 
some improvements for the gallery area.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">September 12, 2001: announcement</P>
By now you probably have heard the terrible tragedy that has hit the United States yesterday. If you live in the US, please do what you can 
to help the rescue efforts.<BR>

<P CLASS="header1">September 11, 2001: site update</P>
<P CLASS="text">A few updates today. I got a picture of myself in Dragon Necropolis, plus added some gallery pictures. Also, I got the full 
name of the NPC that gives out the Skyshrine ranger armour, so the guide has been adjusted.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">September 4, 2001: site update</P>
<P CLASS="text">More updates to the image gallery occured - I'ved added a picture of another of the Velious dragons. Additionally, I found a 
coding bug with the epic guide that would cause it to not display correctly on some versions of Netscape. This has been fixed. I'm currently 
working on a combined Velious armour guide that will cover the Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine quest armour. Since all three armour sets use 
the same quest gems, it makes sense to combine it all into one document instead of a bunch.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">September 3, 2001: site update</P>
<P CLASS="text">I've been busy a lot in-game, but managed to make a site update. A few of the mob pics are offline... well, most of them 
are. Along with most of the quests. The quests which are offline are going through the same treatment as the epic quest faq [available in the 
quests area.] I hope you like the changes - everything should be online soon... give me a week. *grin*</P>

<P CLASS="header1">September 1, 2001: more site twinking</P>
<P CLASS="text">Yep, I'm twinking with the site again. For those who are looking for the more informational aspects of the site, head to the 
quests area. The many images that I have been collecting [epic or otherwise] can all now be found in the gallery area.</P>
