<P>September 6, 2003: CCH!<BR>
The newest Shockwave movie put out by <A HREF="http://www.guildmirage.com">Guild Mirage</A> on Xegony has been keeping me 
distracted from working on my site at all the last two days. If you haven't seen CCH Agent Sinzan yet, I definately recommend stopping 
by their website.</P>

<P>September 4, 2003: Resources Update Live... Partially<BR>
One map was added, which is also a new area. I've also did a partial revamp of the baking area. All I need to add is screen shots of the 
completed recipe, along with sections on tools and ingredients. I also plan to add two baking related guides, one being on the significance 
of other tradeskills to baking and the other being about methods/advise for learning this tradeskill. I plan to work on some more updates to 
the spell book UI mod that I started a while back, but have yet to get around to completing.</P>

<P>August 31, 2003: Resources Updates...<BR>
A bunch of updates to the Resources area have occured lately. Most noteably is the baking area, which has cookbook text added. I plan 
to clean this up a bit and add more books as I run into them. I also have a new map section in progress, which you short start seeing 
appear online in a few days.</P>

<P>July 31, 2003: Profile and Resources Update<BR>
I've updated the alternate advancement section of my profile area to give the description text for each AA skill. I also added a section to 
the lore area that reprints stuff from the in-game story window.</P>

<P>July 29, 2003: New Title Logo<BR>
The new image of Crydee finally arrived today. There was little modification on my part in that I only added the site title and URL to the 
image. The artwork was done by Evan Smith.

<P>July 26, 2003: Profile Update<BR>
I just finished an update of the equipment section in my profile area.</P>

<P>July 15, 2003: Pottery 199<BR>
I've been working hard on tradeskills lately. Brewing and Jewel Craft are both over 220, with Pottery rapidly approaching this range. Once 
this is done, I'll get fletching up to 240+ while working on both Smithing and Tailoring. New Tanaan Crafting Mastery is maxed out. As for 
the site, I've been working on some backend stuff, mostly cleaning up the log file archives.</P>

<P>July 7, 2003: Plane of Time<BR>
I added a bunch of pictures from the Plane of Time yesterday. Other recent additions included Hates Fury (Ykesha) and Veeshan's Peak 
(Kunark.) My next project will be to finish up the Neverwinter Nights based spell icons.</P>
