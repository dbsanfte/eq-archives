<P><B>Port Windurst Quests</B></P>

<P><B>A Discerning Eye (Windurst)</B><BR>
Client: Pygmalion<BR>
Location: Airship Dock, Port Windurst [M-7]<BR>
Requirements: Rank 5<BR>
Items: Dropped Item<BR>
Reward: 500G<BR>
Title: Discerning Individual</P>

<P>For these quests, you will be shown what the passanger looks like after you agree to deliver the dropped item. This is the only time you will be shown what the actual 
passanger looks like, so the most successful way to do this that I have found is to make note of the following: race, gender, hair color, hair style, head equipment, body 
equipment, hands equipment, legs equipment and feet equipment. If you give the item to the correct passanger, you will gain 500 gil, which more than covers the cost of the 
flight itself. Also if you have completed all other Discerning Eye quests, you will get the title "Very Discerning Individual" instead.</P>

<P><B>Know One's Onions</B><BR>
Client: Kohlo-Lakolo<BR>
Location: Warehouses, Port Windurst [G-5]<BR>
Requirements: Truth, Justice and the Onion Way<BR>
Items: 4 Wild Onions<BR>
Reward: Scroll of Blaze Spikes<BR>
Title: S.O.B. Super Hero</P>

<P>Rarab Tails do not drop off of rarabs but off of bumblebees. Even if you are killing the right mobs, getting the drop can take a while. These are also sold at the auction 
house.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Something Fishy</B><BR>
Client: Tokaka<BR>
Location: Fisherman's Guild, Port Windurst [C-8]<BR>
Requirements: none<BR>
Items: Bastore Sardine<BR>
Reward: 70G</P>

<P>This quest is repeatable and one of the easiest ways to gain Windurst fame, but at the same time can be extremely annoying. Bastore Sardines can be either caught with 
fishing or purchased from the nearby Fishing Guild. However in order to repeat this quest, you need to change areas then come back and talk to Tokaka again. She says a lot 
of stuff and pauses during the conversation, both when you talk to her and after the turn in.</P>

Requirements: none<BR>
Items: Rarab Tail<BR>
Reward: Justice Badge<BR>
Title: Star Onion Brigade Member</P>

<P>Rarab Tails do not drop off of rarabs but off of bumblebees. Even if you are killing the right mobs, getting the drop can take a while. These are also sold at the auction 
house.</P>
