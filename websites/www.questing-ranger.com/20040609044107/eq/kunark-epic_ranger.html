Version: 2004.06.01</P>

<P><B>Walkthrough Part 1 - Obtain the Shiny Tin Bowl</B></P>

<P>This part covers the very beginning of the quest up through to the point when you get the Shining Tin Bowl from Ella Foodcrafter. It has one boss 
encounter during the Althele cycle. All other parts can be done solo.</P>

<P><B>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark</B><BR>
Telin Darkforest can be found near the zone to Skyfire Mountains. The easiest way to find him is to head to the North West part of the zone, towards 
Skyfire, and you should eventually pick him up on tracking.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Telin Darkforest'<BR>
Telin Darkforest looks at you serenely. 'Hello, wanderer.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What are you doing in this forest?'<BR>
Telin Darkforest says 'Mighty this place must have been, once. Now scarred by hatred and suffering. I have been sent here seeking answers to problems 
not yet understood.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What answers?'<BR>
Telin Darkforest considers you for a few moments before speaking. 'A great evil walks across the land. The hand of some demon we don't yet know is 
twisting and polluting forests.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What evil?'<BR>
Telin Darkforest says 'If I knew that, I wouldn't be here looking for answers. I would be elsewhere, looking for solutions. For now, I suspect much but know 
little.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What do you suspect?'<BR>
Telin Darkforest looks at you and sighs. 'The lands are changing. Beasts, large and small, have turned upon those who watched over them. Druids and 
rangers, worshippers of both Karana and Tunare, have reported a feeling of hatred throughout their once peaceful lands.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Perhaps it is Innoruuk'<BR>
Telin Darkforest raises his eyebrow slightly and a subtle look of surprise creeps across his face. 'Innoruuk? Perhaps. Aye. It must be. Perhaps I knew and 
didn't want to consider the possibility. It must be this though, and some action will have to be taken.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What action should I take?'<BR>
Telin Darkforest looks at you consideringly and then scribbles something quickly on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful enough. Perhaps you can help 
those who seek to protect nature's peace. Take this note. Deliver it only into the hands of Faelin Bloodbriar. Where you will find her, I cannot say. She is a 
friend of mine and a wanderer. She has been seen from one end of the lands to the other. Seek her out, and quickly.'</P>

<P>Telin Darkforest gives you a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('worn_note-old')">Worn Note</A>" to take to Faelin Bloodbriar.</P>

<P><B>Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark, Faydwer</B></P>

<P>Faelin Bloodbriar spawns at POS 1500, POS 500 in Greater Faydark. Her placeholder is an orc pawn. Faelin is a rare spawn. Just hang around this area 
and kill all orc pawns you see around the area. Once you see either Faelin or an orc pawn spawn, you can proceed to camp just that spot and not worry 
about additional orcs.</P>

<P>*Give the Worn Note to Faelin Bloodbriar.*<BR>
Faelin Bloodbriar reads the note carefully and growls to herself. 'Bad news, eh? Take this ring. There is one elf, dark elf even, who we must go to in order to 
gather insight into Innoruuk's plans. Giz X'Tin, he goes by most commonly. Kithicor seems to be his favorite haunt and most likely you will find him there. 
Don't ask how I know him. Just take the ring as my sign to him and he will speak to you. We don't need to speak again, so don't seek me out, just go to 
Telin. I must leave to investigate these events.'</P>

<P>Faelin Bloodbriar gives you "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('faelins_ring-old')">Faelin's Ring</A>" to take to take to Giz
X'Tin.</P>

<P><B>Giz X`Tin in Kithicor Forest, Antonica</B></P>

<P>Giz X'Tin is a wandering spawn that has been mostly seen towards the north end of the zone. He said to spawn around POS 1000, POS 1500. It is known 
that he does wander the zone. I have seen him on track during the day and night time. The easiest way that I have found to find him is to run along the way 
between West Commons and Rivervale. If he is up, you will most likely pick him up on tracking. Although his faction does not appear to be Neriak based, it is 
unlikely that your faction with him will be high enough. Cast Spirit of Wolf on yourself then run up behind him and use sneak to give him Faelin's Ring.</P>

<P>*Give Faelin’s Ring to Giz X'Tin.*<BR>
Giz X`Tin flips you a coin after he recognizes the ring. 'It seems we have a mutual 'acquaintance.' The coin repays an old debt. You don't have to worry 
about what that is. Luckily, Lord Innoruuk has informed me of your coming and your desires. Fortunately, I have all the answers you require right here at 
the end of my friend's blade. I think I'll be paying my old 'friend' a visit.'<BR>
Teir`Dal Reaver says 'Lord Innoruuk, I have failed you. Forgive me and spare me from service to your undead minions in the world!</P>

<P>Giz X'Tin gives you a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('dark_metal_coin-old')">Dark Metal Coin</A>" to take to Telin Darkforest.</P>

<P><B>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark</B></P>

<P>*Give the Dark Metal Coin to Telin.*<BR>
Telin Darkforest scratches the coin as he looks at it. 'Faelin sent you to Giz? Surprising. This coin speaks to the outcome of your talk. He would hardly give 
this bit of metal to a stranger, but that's a story for a different time. So, you say Giz did confirm Innoruuk's involvement, and something about undead 
minions? Here, take this coin back. Find Arch Druid Althele in the Karanas and show her that. Tell her what we have discussed. She will look kindly on an 
ally in this matter.'</P>

<P>Telin Darkforest gives you a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('worn_dark_metal_coin-old')">Worn Dark Metal Coin</A>" to take to Althele.</P>

<P><B>Althele in East Karana, Antonica</B></P>

<P>Althele can be found close to the Barbarian Village around NEG 3650, NEG 1600. Tholris and Fang should also be there with her. If you see any of the 
other druids with her, do not give her the coin right away. First check to see if someone is currently in the process of doing this part of the quest. If this 
is the case, just wait for them to finish up. Althele, Tholris and Fang all respawn thirty minutes after all the druids have been despawned. The other 
possibility, is that someone had tried to do this part of the quest, failed and the spawn is messed up. If this is the case, you may have to wait for the 
server till after the server goes down again to be able to the quest.</P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
Do not proceed with this part until you are ready to deal with (fight) the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Dark Elf Reavers that will spawn. If you fail to kill the 
Dark Elf Corruptor, you will have to the start quest over from the beginning. This can be done with only a few people or with 2-3 groups. It really depends 
on which classes you bring, their levels and gear. Have everyone else wait up on the hill were the Dark Elf Corruptor spawns. If you are grouped with 
someone on the hill, you can use that person to track your way back to where everyone is waiting rather quickly.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Althele'<BR>
Althele says 'Hello, friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally but lately?'</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Tholris'<BR>
Tholris stares in contemplation at the landscape.<BR>
Althele says 'Tholris does not speak much. He is here to assist me in my duties. He is my hands, as Fang is my eyes.<BR>
Fang barks in response to Althele's words.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Why do you need him as your hands and Fang as your eyes?'<BR>
Althele says 'Yes. I cannot see any longer, my sight long since lost in the march of years. By the blessings of Tunare and Karana, though, I still make 
myself useful.'</P>

<P>*Give Coin to Althele*<BR>
Althele looks at the coin and nods gravely at you as she slips it into a fold of her clothing. 'I see. The story of this coin speaks much to me as do the words 
you have given me. Telin sent word that you would arrive. The tidings you bring are ill indeed. Here, take this amulet and find Sionae. She is nearby. We will 
speak more on this matter when all are present.'</P>

<P>Althele gives you a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('braided_grass_amulet-old')">Braided Grass Amulet</A>" to take to Sionae.</P>

<P>Sionae spawns immediately after you give Althele the Worn Dark Metal Coin and receive the Braided Grass Amulet. She can be found around NEG 2300, 
NEG 930.</P>

<P>*Give Braided Grass Amulet to Sionae*<BR>
Sionae says 'I see that the time has come. Take the amulet and give it to the third of our kin, Nuien. I will meet you at the gathering.'</P>

<P>Sionae gives you a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('frayed_braided_grass_amulet-old')">Frayed Braided Grass Amulet</A>" and Nuien will spawn.</P>

<P>Nuien spawns immediately after you give Sionae the Braided Grass Amulet and receive the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet. He can be found around NEG 
3650, NEG 300, which is around the obelisk on the hill in the gnoll area.</P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
You need to move quickly to Nuien. People who are kill on sight to druids may walk past him due to where he spawns, which will cause him to agro on that 
person and could results in him being killed. If Nuien is killed, the spawn will be messed up and you will have to start quest all over to the point of going back 
to Telin Darkforest for another Worn Note. However, if Nuien has agroed on someone, you can still turn in the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet to him and spawn 
Teloa.</P>

<P>*Give Frayed Braided Grass Amulet to Nuien.*<BR>
Nuien says 'So be it. Do as you have done before and find the next. Teloa is the last.'</P>

<P>Nuien gives the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('frayed_braided_grass_amulet-old')">Frayed Braided Grass Amulet</A>" back to you and Teloa will 
spawn.</P>

<P>Teloa spawns immediately after you give Nuien the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet and receive it back from him. She can be found around NEG 3800, NEG 
2860, which is near the waterfall that is close to the Barbarian Village.</P>

<P>*Give Frayed Braided Grass Amulet to Teloa.*<BR>
Teloa begins walking toward the gathering spot. 'Follow me to the gathering now.'</P>

<P>You do not get the amulet back from Teloa as you no longer need it. Just follow her back to where Althele and the other druids are waiting.</P>

<P>Althele says 'Great mother of life and father of sky, growth and spirit, Tunare and Karana. Innoruuk once again schemes and we have failed in our duties 
to protect our land. We give our powers in sacrifice for your help. Heed our call and send us your wisdom.'</P>

<P>Althele snaps her head towards you. 'Innoruuk's brood is upon us. Go, find the spawn of hatred before they reach this point and destroy them!'</P>

<P>Dark Elf Corruptor shouts 'We come for you, fools. Your reign of weakness over the powers of the land comes to an end now!</P>

<P>Return to the hill then kill the Dark Elf Corruptor and Reavers. While some advocate killing the Dark Elf Corruptor and allowing the Dark Elf Reavers to kill 
the druids, I don't for several reasons. First, it is not within the theme of the quest. Secondly, it is more time productive to kill the reavers also then turn in 
the Fleshbound Tome to Althele right away as you will have to wait longer to turn in the book.</P>

<P>Dark Elf Corruptor<BR>
Level: 45-50<BR>
Class: ?<BR>
The Dark Elf Corruptor is a melee oriented mob that is about Level 50. He can cast some spells, but does not harm touch.</P>

<P>Dark Elf Reaver<BR>
Level: 45-50<BR>
Class: Shadow Knight<BR>
The two Dark Elf Reavers are slightly higher in level and are both shadow knights. They will begin their attack with a harm touch.</P>

<P>Setup:<BR>
This should have been done before starting the sequence with Althele.</P>

<P>Tactics:<BR>
You will want to have one or two people kiting the Dark Elf Reavers around while everyone else concentrates on the Dark Elf Corruptor. It is very critical 
that you agro for the Dark Elf Corruptor is not lost as he will start walking towards the druids. Should the Dark Elf Corruptor gets towards the bottom of 
the hill, he will despawn thus you will have to start over. The mobs themselves are fairly easy to kill. After you kill the Dark Elf Corruptor, you can then kill 
the two Dark Elf Reavers. While they technically do not need to be killed, it is not within the theme of the quest to allow them to kill the druids.</P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
These mobs are all on Neriak faction and multiple raids on them will cause problems for evil friends wishing to assist you.</P>

<P>Once the Dark Elf Corruptor is dead, loot his corpse to get the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('fleshbound_tome-old')">Fleshbound Tome</A>" to 
take to Althele</P>

<P>*Give the "Fleshbound Tome" to Althele.*<BR>
Althele hands the book to Tholris who reads through it with lines of concern etched on his face, then whispers into her ear. 'Dire news, indeed. This cannot 
be allowed. I must keep this book but you must not allow Innoruuk, to seed the land with his hatred and filth. You have only just begun your quest. The 
path you are guided upon will be difficult, if not impossible, but someone must finish it. Please, take this, read of it, follow its instructions. Tunare bless 
your path and Karana watch over you.'</P>

<P>Althele gives you the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('earth_stained_note-old')">Earth Stained Note</A>" to take to Ella Foodcrafter and the 
druids despawn.</P>

<P>Earth Stained Note:<BR>
'We cannot speak again. Our circle is now known and must seek sanctuary. In case this note were to fall into others’ hands. I cannot tell you plainly the 
next steps of your task. All I can say is to seek she who walks the path of the mother, she who walks the lands in service to her kin. Give her this note and 
she will know'</P>

<P><B>Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket, Antonica</B></P>

<P>Since Ella Foodcrafter will run all over the zone, it is easier to wait near the guards that are close to the zone to Rivervale rather than chase her all over 
the zone and the wait usually isn't long. Since she doesn't stay in one place for long, so you may want to bring along a friend to constantly hail until you 
give her the Earth Stained Note.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Ella Foodcrafter'<BR>
Ella Foodcrafter says 'Hi, hi. I've got a lot to do, many mouths to feed, some filthy goblins to smack. If you don't need me for something, please let me go 
back to my work. Karana watch over you.'</P>

<P>Make sure that you have at least one General inventory slot free as she gives you a container.</P>

<P>*Give Earth Stained note to Ella Foodcrafter.*<BR>
Ella Foodcrafter says 'Hmmm. I've been waiting for someone to bring me this. I'm sorry such a young one as you has taken up this task. Maybe the sky god 
blesses ya though. Aye, ya have that look in your eye. Our task is to focus the blessings of the gods and cleanse the filth from the land. I'll need two things 
from ya.</P>

<P>You say, 'What two things?'<BR>
Ella Foodcrafter says 'Well, ya ask before ya act. That's a good sign. What I need isn't easy to find. First, I need a mixture. Plain sounding enough but it's a 
special one. Cleanses the mind and focuses the earth's energies into a forest walker's mind. I don't know how to make it. I don't even know what it's called. 
I merely know it exists and we'll be needing it for our task. When ya do find how to make it ya can mix it in that bowl. Keep it when you're done, it's a good 
bowl.'</P>

<P>Ella Foodcrafter gives you a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('shiny_tin_bowl-old')">Shiny Tin Bowl</A>" to create the Hardened Mixture.</P>

<P>You say, 'What is the second task?'<BR>
Ella Foodcrafter grins. 'Good, ya didn't run off without finding out what else ya need to do. Second, I need a special type of bowl. An ancient type of bowl, 
which strengthened the food placed inside it, once made by the elves of old. Again, I cannot tell ya how it is made for the making was lost to the ages. 
Seek this knowledge and these items out in the lands. Come to me when ya have found both.'</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Walkthrough Part 2 - Create the Hardened Mixture</B></P>

<P>You will need to forage the four ingredients that will make the Hardened Mixture at this point. It does not matter what order you forage them in, and 
they can all be foraged anywhere in their respective zones. These will be easier to forage at higher skill levels, but once your skill is high enough that you 
start to forage things beyond basic food and water, you will have a change of obtaining them. All four ingredients are non-ediable.</P>

<P><UL>
	<LI>Forage "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('chilled_tundra_root-old')">Chilled Tundra Root</A>" in Everfrost.</LI>
	<LI>Forage "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('ripened_heartfruit-old')">Ripened Heartfruit</A>" in Greater Faydark.</LI>
	<LI>Forage "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('speckled_molded_mushroom-old')">Speckled Molded Mushroom</A>" in Innothule Swamp.</LI>
	<LI>Forage "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('sweetened_mudroot-old')">Sweetened Mudroot</A>" in Misty Thicket.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Once you have all four ingredients, place them in the Shiny Tin Bowl that you received from Ella Foodcrafter, then press the combine button to create 
the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('hardened_mixture-old')">Hardened Mixture</A>." There is no skill check involved and you cannot fail to create 
this.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Walkthrough Part 3 - Ancient Pattern</B></P>

<P>This part of the quest is more of a sub-part and can be completed at almost any any point. It has no prerequisites other than having the required 
faction with the NPCs that must be dealt with is needed to start this.  It can also be done completely solo and has no combat.</P>

<P><B>Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep, Kunark</B></P>

<P>Alrik Farsight is on a Island near the fire pots in the South-West part of the zone. He can be found either on or very close to the chessboard.</P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
Rangers usually do not have high enough faction with Alrik Farsight, unless they have been doing a lot of Felwithe-based caster quests. If he will not 
respond to you, go to the Magician's Guild in Felwithe B and give Niola Impholder four bat wings at a time until she is amiable to you. If you have trouble 
getting Niola Impholder to take the Batwings from you, use sneak initially.</P>

<P>You say, ‘I seek an ancient type of bowl made by the elves of old.'<BR>
Alrik Farsight rummages thriugh his tattered bag and throws aside a towel. ‘To many towels. Oh well, someone told me they were good to have once. Here 
it is, a bowl pattern. Interesting bowl. Looks almost like a magical bowl but I’m no potter. You need it, you say? Well, it is interesting. Part of my research 
here is for the wizard guild in Felwithe. I’m sure they’d put a high price on this one, the enchanters guild being so interested in trading for magical 
paraphernalia and all. Of course if you helped me out on a chore I have, I’d be happy to give it to you. I need to deliver an artifact to the guild and I’d much 
rather stay here exploring. If you wish, you can take the artifact and return with the receipt and I will give you the pattern.</P>

<P>You say, ‘I will take the artifact.'<BR>
Alrik Farsight says ‘Hah! Okay then. Here take this to Farios Elianos in Felwithe. He will give you the Receipt.</P>

<P>Alrik Farsight gives you "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('crushed_pot-old')">Crushed Pot</A>" to give to Farios Elianos.</P>

<P><B>Farios Elianos in Felwithe [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P>Farios Elianos can be found in the shop selling magic reagents that is straight across from the zone entrance.</P>

<P>*Give Farios Elianos the Crushed Pot*<BR>
Farios Elianos says, ‘Why in the nine hells would I need a crushed pot? Perhaps I could use it to not hold water! Why did you even bother me with this? Are 
you mentally deficient? Apparently. Oh, well, you're just a servant boy. Well, then, we'll make you useful, if just a little. Take this shopping list and go get 
my groceries. Take it to Nora in the tavern. She'll know what I need.</P>

<P>Farios Elianos givecs you a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('grocery_list-old')">Grocery List</A>" to give to Merchant Nora.</P>

<P><B>Merchant Nora in Felwithe [A], Faydwer</B></P>

<P>Merchant Nora can be found in one of the shops. Check around town, and you should be able to find her. She is not in the same part of town as Farios 
Elianos.</P>

<P>*Give Merchant Nora the Grocery List.*<BR>
Merchant Nora says 'You hardly look like the type of errand runner Farios usually sends out to fetch his groceries but here they are. I hope he chokes on 
them. Oh, and tell him he still owes me five gold for his last order!</P>

<P>Merchant Nora gives you a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('bag_of_provisions-old')">Bag of Provisions</A>" to take to Farios Elianos.</P>

<P><B>Farios Elianos in Felwithe [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P>*Give Farios Elianos the Bag of Provisions.*<BR>
Farios Elianos says 'Ah, good. Here's a few copper and a receipt for services rendered. Now be off, I'm sure citizens across the land are in dire need of 
broken pots at right this moment.</P>

<P>Farios Elianos gives you a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('receipt-old')">Receipt</A>" to take to Alrik Farsight.</P>

<P><B>Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep, Kunark</B></P>

<P>*Give Alrik Farsight the Receipt.*<BR>
Alrik Farsight grins happily. 'Excellent! Was he pleased with the artifact? Oh, that's not even worth answering. I'm sure he was. He's always happy with the 
things I send him. That's why he honored me with this position of esteem, searching for useful and powerful items in this newly discovered land.'</P>

<P>You recived an "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('ancient_pattern-old')">Ancient Pattern</A>" which is used to create the Runecrested Bowl.</P>

<P><B>Walkthrough Part 4 - Platinum Speckled Powder</B></P>

<P>This part of the quest is more of a sub-part and can be completed at almost any any point. It has no prerequisites other than having the required 
faction with the NPCs that must be dealt with is needed to start this.  It can also be done completely solo and has no combat.</P>

<P><B>Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie, Kunark</B></P>

<P>Go to Firiona Vie in Kunark and forage a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('rose_of_firiona-old')">Rose of Firiona</A>." This item is tradeable, but 
does not stack.</P>

<P><B>Niera Farbreeze in Surefall Glade, Antonica</B></P>

<P>She can be found somewhere near the lake, not far from Merdan Fleetfoot. Sit by Niera Farbreeze for a while until she starts to hum a tune. [Actually, 
this is optional and you can immediately ask her about the tune if you want. You can also skip this entire part completely and go ahead to the Human 
Skeleton.]</P>

<P>Niera Farbreeze hums softly, a little tune that tickles the back of your mind but you can't quite recall.</P>

<P>You say, 'What tune is that.'<BR>
Niera Farbreeze says 'Ohh. Just a little song my mother taught me when I was young. It speaks of the earth, the sky, and the sparkling stars above, always 
there.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Why are they always there?'<BR>
Niera Farbreeze says 'Aye, always there. Like this small bag I wear around my neck. The last gift of my dying mother. It holds a fine dust, a dust she 
collected during her short life, that she believed brought her luck. It's speckled, lecked as the night sky is with stars.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Where did she find the speckled, flecked dust?'<BR>
Niera Farbreeze says 'I've had this little bit of dust, all I have of my mother, for many years now. It's the only reminder I have of her. She said it was 
special, magical, a warmth to help me through the nights. Even if my life were in the balance, I would have a hard time giving it up.'</P>

<P><B>Merdan Fleetfoot in Surefall Glade, Antonica</B></P>

<P>He can be found somewhere near the lake, not far from Niera Farbreeze.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Merdan Fleetfoot'<BR>
Merdan Fleetfoot says 'Yes Niera! Oh. Erm. Hi. I mean, uh. How are you?'</P>

<P>You say, 'Who is Niera?'<BR>
Merdan Fleetfoot blushes. 'She is, uh.. I don't know. I havent been able to speak with her. She has many suitors, and I'm just another poor ranger. I spend 
my days here pretending to fish, to carve bows, but really I'm just waiting to catch a limpse of her. I thought about adventuring into the world to find some 
kind of token to give her, to show her how I feel, but I can't tear myself away from here.'</P>

<P>*Give Merdan Fleetfoot the Rose of Firiona.*<BR>
Merdan Fleetfoot blinks and looks at the flower. 'This is perfect. Thank you! I'm going to go over to her now. Erm, well, maybe I'll wait a week to let the uh.. 
beauty of the flower.. uhm.. blossom. Yes, that sounds good. Here, you take this painting. I don't need it now. I made it myself, she wouldn't like it 
anyways.'</P>

<P>Merdan Fleetfoot gives you a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('wood_painting-old')">Wood Painting</A>" to give to a Human Skeleton.</P>

<P><B>Human Skeleton in Frontier Mountains, Kunark</B></P>

<P>The Human Skeleton spawns around NEG 2100, POS 2000. The skeleton is not fixed to this spot and will walk around some. If you do not find the Human 
Skeleton right away, hang out around this location and keep checking tracking. Since the Human Skeleton will despawn after this part, you might have to 
wait for it to spawn.</P>

<P>*Give the wood painting to the human skeleton.*<BR>
a human skeleton begins to crack and disintegrate, its body collapsing into a pile of dust that scatters into the winds. On the ground you notice a locket on 
a fine, thin chain which you pick up.</P>

<P>You get a "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('silver_chained_locket-old')">Silver Chained Locket</A>" to give to Niera Farbreeze.</P>

<P>The Human Skeleton despawns at this point.</P>

<P><B>Niera Farbreeze in Surefall Glade, Antonica</B></P>

<P>*Give Niera Farbreeze the locket.<BR>
Niera Farbreeze says 'This, this is my mother's amulet. I cannot believe it. Please, take this powder you say you need. Perhaps it does have powers, I don't 
know, I don't care. Thank you, my eternal thanks for this.</P>

<P>Niera Farbreeze gives you "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('platinum_speckled_powder-old')">Platinum Speckled Powder</A>" which is used to 
create the Runecrested Bowl.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Walkthrough Part 5 - Enchanted Clay</B></P>

<P>This part of the quest is more of a sub-part and can be completed at almost any any point. It has no prerequisites other than having the required 
faction with the NPCs that must be dealt with is needed to start this. There is some amount of combat, which will require a decent group or small raiding 
force for less advanced guilds. While the item is tradeable, it is very unlikely you will see it for sale at this point due to the unpopularity of the zone and the 
rarity of the drop itself.</P>

<P><B>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P>Kinlo Strongarm is located in Everhot's Forge on bottom level.</P>

<P>This dialogue part is optional. It mostly sets the direction you need to go next and checks your faction. Although it seems like there should be dialogue 
before this, that has never been found. Kinlo Strongarm does not respond to hails.</P>

<P>You say, 'what mud'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'Eh? Oh, the clay. Arrr. Lots o that mud round 'ere. Mostly, a good dwarf not be needin somethin so soft 'n squishy but the womenfolk, 
you know, the elves come lookin fer it. If ye be one o' those pansy elves wantin some mud fer workin into fairy statues, flashy trinkets, 'n pig sticker arrers 
then I can get it for ye. Course I'd be lowerin meself, a good dwarf, ta be diggin that kinda mush outta the ground, but I can do it fer ya.</P>

<P>You say, 'do it for me'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'Arrr. Shaddap. I ain't doin it til ya bring me somethin. A fee, I guess yed call it, fer lowerin meself ta elf woman work. Go get me a 
good strong axe and I'll do it fer ye. Mebbe somethin with a good tinted polish on it. I got plenty o' axes but no tinted ones. Har har! Colored axe. Somethin 
to go with the color left on the blade after I be crackin open a gobbo head.</P>

<P><B>Black Reaver in City of Mist, Kunark</B></P>

<P>Name: Black Reaver<BR>
Level: low 50s<BR>
Class: ?<BR>
Black Reavers are melee oriented mobs in the low 50s range. They tend to hit very hard and can blind you as well. I highly recommend making a hotkey to 
announce if you are blinded then remembering where you put it.</P>

<P>Setup:<BR>
The most common spot to setup up is just inside the castle itself, right after you go through the door. There will be some mobs here so you will first need 
to clear the area so as to not have to deal with them while fighting the Black Reavers.</P>

<P>Tactics:<BR>
Have a monk (or some other FD class) single pull these, then just kill them as quickly as you can. Should an iksar ghost spawn out of one of the Black 
Reavers, do not attack it.</P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
The <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('jade_reaver-old')">Jade Reaver</A> is a random rare drop, but is tradeable.</P>

<P><B>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P>*Give Kinlo Storngarm the Jade Reaver.*<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'Arrrrr. Ooooo. Arrrrrr... Yah, now that's what I be callin a good lookin axe. I be crackin a few skulls with this one. Oh, here's yer block 
o' mud. Our priests o' Brell use the mud pit fer relievin themselves after really hard ale blessin ceremonies, so ya ain't got ta be enchantin it in holy water or 
anythin cause they already have. Har har!</P>

<P>Kinlo Storngarm gives you the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('enchanted_clay-old')">Enchanted Clay</A>" which is used to create the 
Runecrested Bowl.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Walkthrough Part 6 - Runecrested Bowl</B></P>

<P>Combine the Ancient Pattern, Enchanted Clay, and Platinum Speckled Powder in a Pottery Wheel to make a
<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('runecrested_bowl-old')">Runecrested Bowl</A>. Although this works off of pottery skill, it is a no fail combine and any 
pottery wheel should work. Make sure that you hit the Combine button on the Pottery Wheel after you place all items in it. If you close the Pottery Wheel 
without hitting combine, you will lose all the items as they are No Drop and have to re-do parts 3-5 of the quest.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Walkthrough Part 7 - The Ancient Longsword</B></P>

<P><B>Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket, Antonica</B></P>

<P>*Give Ella Foodcrafter the Hardened Mixture and the Runecrested Bowl.*<BR>
Ella Foodcrafter smiles slowly as she works the mixture in the bowl and it starts to shine with power. 'This is... a piece of a lost magic item known as 
Nature's Gem. When restored to completeness I've heard its healing powers will be extraodrinary. Take it now. I will take the bowl and hopefully do some 
good from my end. From here, you can go many ways but I can't guide your path step by step. The only advise I can give you is to look for ones such as 
yourself.'</P>

<P>Ella Foodcrafter gives you the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('softly_glowing_stone-old')">Softly Glowing Stone</A>" which will be used to get 
the Warmly Glowing Stone.</P>

<P><B>Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie, Kunark</B></P>

<P>This dialogue part is optional. It sets up what you need to do next and checks your faction. Foloal Stormforest can be found standing on the wall that 
surrounds the city of Firiona Vie.</P>

<P>You say, 'are you one such as myself?'<BR>
Foloal Stormforest stares at you and whispers. 'You must be the one that has been spoken of. Yes, yes I am one of the circle. There are many of us in the 
lands right now, all seeking answers to the ills that have befallen our homes.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what answers?'<BR>
Foloal Stormforest says 'I have heard whispers of new Iksar movements in the land. The name of Venril Sathir is on the scaled lips and sharp tongues of 
every cold blooded lizard in this place.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what about venril sathir?'<BR>
Foloal Stormforest says 'All I've heard are whispers of connections between the undead lizards and the dark god of hate. There's some kind of history behind 
the two. It might be that Venril is the main focus of Innoruuk's will in the land. Then again, maybe not, but this is the best we've gotten so far. If you think 
you can do it, then find him and remove him from the face of this earth. Bring me the half of the stone I know you have and whatever conduit of power you 
find on his rotting corpse.</P>

<P><B>Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle, Kunark</B></P>

<P>If the normal spawned version of Venril Sathir is up, he must be killed as both versions of Venril Sathir cannot be up at the same time. Venril Sathirs 
remains will spawn randomly after Venril Sathir dies. Venril Sathirs remains spawn in the "setup" room before Venril Sathir's lair.</P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
Do not proceed with this part until you are ready to deal with (fight) Venril Sathir, who will spawn. If you fail to kill Venril Sathir, you will have to redo this 
part. You will need a Summoned: Firefly Globe and scroll for "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('spell_resurrection-old')">Spell: Resurrection</A>" to 
complete this sequence. Venril Sathir will drop two Pulsing Green Stones and nothing else.</P>

<P>Venril Sathirs remains says 'The living fire. I seek the fires of life. Bring them.</P>

<P>Use the spell Dance of the Fireflies to summon a Firefly Globe which identifies as
"<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('summoned_firefly_globe-old')">Summoned: Firefly Globe</A>." This can only be done during the evening in Norrath 
and can also be done ahead of time.</P>

<P>*Give Venril Sathirs remains the Firefly Globe.*<BR>
Venril Sathirs remains grasps the glowing sphere of fireflies from your hands. Tendrils of mystical energy begin to flow forth from the swarm of glowing 
insects like tiny fingers. The glowing tendrils begin to reach into the ribcage of the rotting remains of Venril Sathir, coalescing into the form of an iksar 
ghost.</P>

<P>Venril Sathirs remains despawn and the Spirit of Venril Sathir spawns immediately. He will be located wherever Venril Sathirs remains was at when you 
turned in the Firefly Globe.</P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
Do not proceed with this part until you are ready to deal with (fight) Venril Sathir, who will spawn. If you fail to kill Venril Sathir, you will have to redo this 
part.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Spirit of Venril Sathir'<BR>
Spirit of Venril Sathir says 'So mortals, you seek to end the tainting of Tunare's children? So be it, I have no cares. My death has been caused by this 
foolishness and I want no more to do with it. Bring me a scroll with the knowledge of resurrection so that I may once again live. I will hand you that which 
you seek.</P>

<P>If you do not already have it with you, you will need a copy of the Spell: Resurrection, which can be obtained from most cleric guilds.</P>

<P>*Give the Spirit of Venril Sathir the Spell: Resurrection spell.*<BR>
Spirit of Venril Sathir says 'I am alive! My thanks to you. And now I will aid you in your quest for preserving the forests of norrath. Your carcass will help 
nurture the soils of the wilderness.</P>

<P>Venril Sathir spawns. Kill Venril Sathir to get the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('pulsing_green_stone-old')">Pulsing Green Stone</A>" which will be 
used to get the Warmly Glowing Stone.</P>

<P>Venril Sathir<BR>
Level: 55<BR>
Class: Necromancer<BR>
Just because the triggered version of Venril Sathir is easier, does not mean you should slack off. He will still can and will Lifetap although it will not occur as 
often as with the normal version.</P>

<P>Camp Setup - Standard:<BR>
The standard camp setup is to clear the all the additional mobs that spawn around the setup area, then spawn Venril Sathir in the setup area when you are 
ready to fight him.</P>

<P>Camp Setup - Alternate (Zone In):<BR>
An alternate method would be to stand on the platform area above Venril Sathirs remains, cast Cinder Jolt on him then pull him to the zone. When you get 
Vernil Sathirs remains to the zone area, zone out to dump agro and keep hailing him after zoning back in. After your forces have arrived and area ready, you 
can trigger him at the zone area. I only recommend using this method during off hours when virtually nobody is in the zone. [Should there be some other 
people in the zone, be sure to warn them just in case they decide to leave around the time that you start.] One thing to keep in mind with this camp setup 
is that is not viable on all servers. The politics on some servers are such that this method is not acceptable under any circumstances, even if the people you 
bring to fight are the only ones in the zone. On such servers, you can expect other people to make attempts to ruin your raid should you be seen doing this. 
Know your server environment before using non-standard methods.</P>

<P>Tactics:<BR>
For fighting Venril Sathir, my best advise is to use the same tactics that you would use for the full-strenght non-triggered version. General strategy involves 
having enchanters cast rune on everyone, then people call out when it drops. Using a "Main Tank" approach is best here where you rune one warrior who 
engages first and tries to hold agro for the entire fight then everyone joins in afterwards. Clerics concentrate their heals to keeping this warrior alive, who 
holds the agro. Everyone else needs to make sure that they do no draw agro no matter what. Should the main tank drop, it will be necessary for everyone 
to stop fighting while the next tank establishes agro.</P>

<P><B>Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie, Kunark</B></P>

<P>*Give Foloal Stormforest the Softly Glowing Stone and the Pusling Green Stone.*<BR>
Foloal Stormforest blinks and carefully takes the stones from you, cautiously scratching the jagged green stone against the other. Its skin seems to shiver 
and flake at the contact and eventually begins to shine brightly. 'With the gem nature's balance is complete. Take the stone and walk your path. Blade or 
lightning caller, burning sword or the mother's walk.'</P>

<P>Foloal Stormforest gives you the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('warmly_glowing_stone-old')">Warmly Glowing Stone</A>" to take to Telin 
Darkforest.</P>

<P><B>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark</B></P>

<P>*Give Telin Darkforest the Warmly Glowing Stone.*<BR>
Telin Darkforest nods as he unbuckles his sword and hands it to you. 'The storm callers are working on containing and fighting against the corruption but 
they can not hold back the inevitable for long. It is up to us to strike against Innoruuk directly. If we were warriors or paladins we would have a fancy 
ceremony and plenty of feasting but we're just rangers, without time for pleasantries. The sword you hold in your hands is one of the oldest blades known, 
even to the eldest. To strike at the darkest heart of evil requires a weapon beyond this, or even ones you may carry at your side. The first task, the first 
preperation you must make is the smithing of that blade. Its edge sharpened, its balance made perfect. When you have finished, bring me this sword 
again.'</P>

<P>Telin gives you an "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('ancient_longsword-old')">Ancient Longsword</A>" to be used to get the
Refined Ancient Sword.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Walkthrough Part 8 - Swiftwind and Earthcaller</B></P>

<P><B>Jaeil the Wretched in The Hole, Odus</B></P>

<P>Jaeil the Wretched can be found in The Hole. I do not have a location for him because he is not hard to find. As of a few months ago, he now despawns 
when you spawn Jaeil the Insane. However the quest isn't a popular as it used to be with people fighting over spawn rights. The odds are that more likely 
than not, he will be there. As before though, The only hard part here is getting to Jaeil the Wretched. If you can get there, you should be able to deal with 
Jaeil the Insane with no problems. This will be a triggered spawn, and you will need to be prepared to fight him.</P>

<P>Jaeil the Wretched whimpers pathetically as his reflection catches his eye. He turns and stares pitifully at the ceiling.</P>

<P>Jaeil the Wretched shields his eyes from his reflection in the water, occasionally gibbering as he scratches at a flapping, rotted patch of skin on his 
sunken face. In his arms he cradles something. He seems to emanate an aura of power.</P>

<P>Stand behind Jaeil the Wretched to make him indifferent to you by using sneak. Be sure to /CON him to confirm that he is indifferent.</P>

<P>*Give Jaeil the Wretched the Shiny Tin Bowl so that he will see his reflection.*<BR>
Jaeil the Wretched howls in anger, his body seeming to suck energy from the walls around him as he sees his reflection. He pulls a hammer from the bundle 
in his arms and swings fiercely at your head.</P>

<P>Name: Jaeil the Insane</P>
Level: 50<BR>
Class: Necromancer<BR>
While Jaeil the Insane is a necromancer based mob, he is a very weak one.</P>

<P>Setup:<BR>
In all cases, you will want to setup just around the corner and up the incline from Jaeil the Wretched. The differences though come from how you actually 
get there.</P>

<P>Getting to Camp - Standard:<BR>
The standard method is to just fight your way down, with typically two to three groups of people. The key thing here is to not go so slow that you get 
caught up in respawn but not so fast that your clerics and enchanters will be low or out of mana at the more difficult spawns.</P>

<P>Getting to Camp - Alternate:<BR>
Have a magician suicide to create a corpse then consent a Necromancer who pulls the Magicians corpse down to the camp sport (or a spot close by that 
is free of wanderers.) It will be necessary to Feign Death at times drop mob agro. When the corpse is at the camp location, he then resurrects the Magician 
using an Essence Emerald. The Magician then uses Call of Hero to summon everyone else down to the camp spot.</P>

<P>Tactics:<BR>
Area effect spells should not be used due to the close proximity of Jaeil the Wretched. Once Jaeil the Insane is pulled to where your forces await, he is an 
easy fight. There is no one best strategy to use him as even a zerg rush will do the job effectively.</P>

<P>Jaeil the Insane spawns and attacks. Jaeil the Wretched will still be there; just ignore him as he is not part of the fight. You only need to fight Jaeil 
the Insane.</P>

<P>Kill Jaeil the Insane and loot the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('soulbound_hammer-old')">Soulbound Hammer</A>" to give to Mairee Silentone.</P>

<P>If for any reason your entire raiding party dies at Jaeil the Insane or on the way there, the easiest way to recover is by having some people make 
Halfling Rogues that worship Brell Serilis, then have a Druid port to Misty Thicket to pick them up and port them to Toxxulia Forest, cast Spirt of the Wolf, 
then run to the Hole. Additionally, you can bind in the Paineel area, near the lake outside The Hole. If you duck, you should be able to fit through the crack 
in the door. Most mobs in The Hole will look at these characters dubiously, but will not argo. For the ones that will argo, you can Hide and Sneak to get past 
them. You will want at least two - one to drag corpses from past the drop down point to the ledge and a second to drag corpses from the ledge to near the 
entrance area. It can be done with just one, but will go faster with two.</P>

<P><B>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P>This part is completely optional. It is here to for completeness as it gives you a clue as to what eventually needs to be done with the hammer.</P>

<P>*Give the Soulbound Hammer to Kinlo Strongarm.*<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm examines the hammer respectfully, admiring its craftsmanship. He strikes it against his anvil and winces as a howl fills the air. 'This is one 
of the ancients' hammers? I can almost, well, almost hear it callin ta me. It's strong, that's fer sure, lad. I don't know how ye got it, but aye, a dwarf could 
make a mighty blade with this. It's lookin like this thing still has its owner inside it though. I'm not knowin how, and not wantin to know, but fer yer own 
good ye better find some way ta get 'im out.'</P>

<P>Kinlo Strongarm returns the "Soulbound Hammer" to you to give to Mairee Solentone. The properties of it have not changed.</P>

<P>You say, 'what ancient'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'The ancient smiths, for what I think yer askin about, ain't been around fer a long time, laddy. Last anyone heard o' the ancients was 
'fore my time even. There be more than a few tales about 'em.</P>

<P>You say, 'what few tales'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'There be some who talk about how the ancient smiths went down to work fer the duke o' below, sayin he be needin some fine 
dwarven smiths fer makin some castle or some such. There be tales that the ancients were so good at smithin that the duke took 'em down and made 
'em head smiths over his minions. There's even tales that some o the smiths' souls were trapped in their hammers, stuck there by some necromancer or 
somethin, as punishment or retribution.</P>

<P>You say, 'what hammer hammers?'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'Aye. Some says their souls were bound into their hammers by an Erudite necromancer and enchanter. They say they used the power 
of the hammers ta profit by makin ships, boats, and houses better than any other merchants. Sad tale, if'n it be true.</P>

<P>You say, 'What Erudite enchanter?'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'I'm not knowing more about the story, lad. Everything I know is already in what I said. Aye, Erudites. I suppose if yer wantin ta run 
after shortbeard tales you can look over on that plagued island they call Odus.</P>

<P><B>Mairee Silentone in Eurdin, Odus</B></P>

<P>Mairee Silentone is in the jewlrey shop near the bank. She is at the back of the store. More recent accountings suggest that she will respond with less 
than indifferent faction, but you may want to use sneak if you have any doubts.</P>

<P>You say, 'What ancient hammer?'<BR>
Mairee Silentone says 'Yes, the ancient hammer. I heard something about that. Do you mind if I take a look at it?'</P>

<P>*Give Mairee Silentone the Soulbound Hammer.*<BR>
Mairee Silentone makes a few marks on the hammer, and all the while you can hear a muffled cursing coming from the hammer head. 'Yes, it is an ancient 
dwarf's hammer. Interesting artifact. I've marked it to keep it stable while you retrieve something for me. You need to travel to the Plane of Air and find a 
swirling sphere of color. Bring it and the hammer back to me.'</P>

<P>Mairee Silentone gives you the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('dwarven_smiths_hammer-old')">Dwarven Smiths Hammer</A>."</P>

<P><B>Essensce Tamer in Plane of Sky</B></P>

<P>The Plane of Sky can only be reached by the Level 46 Wizard spell "Alter Plane: Sky." This spell does require a reagent to be cast called "Cloudy Stone 
of Veeshan," which is needed for each person traveling to the Plane of Sky. This reagent can only be purchased at the 3rd floor of the City Library of 
Erudin. They currently cost a little over 100PP each. The Swirling Sphere of Color drops on either Island 4 or 5 [depending on if you count Djorn's Island.] 
To get to Island 5, you must do all the previous islands in order. Since Island 2 [Noble Djorn] may be skipped, it is not always counted and will not be 
covered here.</P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
Do not us area effect spells at all in the Plane of Sky. Also this zone should not be confused with the Plane of Air, which is Xegony's realm and part of 
the Planes of Power expansion.</P>

<P>Isle One: Thunder Spirit Princess<BR>
Type: Non-Agro<BR>
Key Turn-In Item: Miniature Sword and Lost rabbit's foot<BR>
Key To Next Isle: Key of Swords [for Noble of Djorn] and Key of Misplaced [Protector of Sky]<BR>
Although this isle is non-agro, mobs will assist each other. Kill all the Thunder Spirits to get the turn-in items, then kill the Thunder Spirit Princess when 
you are ready to spawn Sirran the Lunatic. Since the next isle is agro, you will want to invis your entire raiding party then use the Key of Misplaced to 
reach the next isle.</P>

<P>Isle Two: Noble Djorn<BR>
Since Isle Two does not need to be visited in order to complete this quest, it is not being covered.</P>

<P>Isle Three: Protector of Sky<BR>
Type: Agro<BR>
Key Turn-In Item: Broken Mirror<BR>
Key To Next Isle: Key of Misfortune<BR>
Since everything on this isle is agro, you will need to be more careful here. Kill all the Azaracks as one of the Azaracks will be the placeholder for the 
Protector of Sky. Once this mob is killed, Sirran the Lunatic will spawn.</P>

<P>Isle Four: Gorgalosk<BR>
Type: Non-Agro<BR>
Key Turn-In Item: Animal Figurine<BR>
Key To Next Isle: Key of Beasts<BR>
Although this isle is non-agro, mobs will assist each other excluding the meteors. Once Gorgalosk has been killed, Sirran the Lunatic will spawn.</P>

<P>Isle Five: Collector of Souls<BR>
Type: Non-Agro and Agro<BR>
Key Turn-In Item: Bird Whistle<BR>
Key To Next Isle: Avian Key<BR>
This isle has a combination of agro and non-agro mobs. Pre-split [Level 52] mobs are all non-agro. Split mobs, Overseer of Air and Collector of Souls are all 
agro. [The Overseer of Air is spawned by having killed Noble Dojorn back on Isle 2.] The way the split mobs work is that when you kill the initial mob, two 
Level 54 mobs spawn immediately where it dies. When each of the Level 54 mobs dies, a single Level 56 mob will spawn. Both the griffins and the Pegasus 
will split. Essence Tamers that will drop the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('swirling_sphere_of_color-old')">Swirling Sphere of Color</A>" are the 
Level 56 split griffons. Should you wish to progress to the next isle, kill the Collector of Souls to spawn Sirran the Lunatic.</P>

<P><B>Mairee Silentone in Eurdin, Odus</B></P>

<P>*Give Mairee Silentone the Dwarven Smiths Hammer and the Swirling Sphere of Color.*<BR>
Mairee Silentone holds the sphere and makes intricate marks and patterns on it, eventually turning the entire crystal clear. She rolls it across the hammer, 
raising a ringing sound in the room. 'There. Now take the hammer back to Kinlo. He'll know what to do from here. Good luck to you.'</P>

<P>Mairee Silentone gives you the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('hammer_of_the_ancients-old')">Hammer of the Ancients</A>" to give to Kinlo 
Strongarm.</P>

<P><B>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P>*Give Kinlo Strongarm the Hammer of the Ancients, which causes Usbak the Old to spawn.*<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm looks at the hammer and nods once before slamming the head against his anvil, and shattering the head. In a cloud of dust, another 
dwarf appears from the cloud and tosses you a hunk of metal. Kinlo stares in awe.</P>

<P>Usbak the Old is a triggered spawn that occurs when you give Kinlo Strongarm the Hammer of the Ancients. He will be next to Kinlo.</P>

<P>Usbak the Old gives you "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('small_bit_of_mithril_ore-old')">Small bit of Mithril Ore</A>" to give to Kinlo Strongarm.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Usbak the Old'<BR>
Usbak the Old says 'Took ya long enough! Ye'd think ya had an orc head on them shoulders there. I'm owin' ya for yer help though. Else I'd have been on 
that darn hammer for ages. Ye said ya had an ancient blade or somethin ta be smithin. If so lemme see it.</P>

<P>If you found it necessary to use sneak to get Kinlo Strongarm to respond to you favorably, you will need to use sneak with Usbak the Old as well.</P>

<P>*Give Usbak the Old the Ancient Longsword.*<BR>
Usbak the Old admires the blade and then starts to bang the edge with a hammer. 'Hah, that was a good blade, no doubt. Ain't seen one I couldn't make 
better though. I'm knowin' yer cause and all I know is ye should take that ancient blade ta yer friend in the woods, he'll know what to do now. With that 
I'm gonna be takin muh leave. Debt paid and all. If'n yer wantin' another blade, which ye do, ye got enough ore left that Kinlo can do it for ye'</P>

<P>Usbak the Old gives you the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('refined_ancient_sword-old')">Refined Ancient Sword</A>" to take to Telin 
Darkforest then despawns.</P>

<P>*Give the Small bit of Mithril Ore to Kinlo Stirngarm.*<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'Erm. Well, I aint never worked with this stuff but here's what I got for ya. It ain't bad, pretty much like the one ye got there. I 
suppose ye should take the one the ancient made and show it ta yer friend.</P>

<P>Kinlo Strongarm gives you the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('refined_mithril_blade-old')">Refined Mithril Blade</A>" to take to Xanuusus.</P>

<P><B>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark</B></P>

<P>*Give Telin Darkforest the Refined Ancient Sword.*<BR>
Telin Darkforest smiles slowly. 'Now that's fine work. Just a moment, we have a friend here who can enchant one of the blades. Give her the blade the 
ancient smithed.'</P>

<P>Faelin spawns near Telin Darkforest after you give him the Refined Ancient Sword.</P>

<P>*Give Faelin the Refined Ancient Sword. She enchants it and returns it to you in the form of Swiftwind.*<BR>
Faelin smiles at you, then closes her eyes as she sets the gem 'Nature's Balance' into the crossguard and begins to channel her spirit into the sword. The 
ground rumbles loudly as she casts. She collapses in exhaustion after a short time. 'Take the blade, and perhaps you can finish this. You must strike at 
Innoruuk's heart. Bring his shattered gem and the mithril blade to Xanuusus. Only with Innoruuk's death can the balance of the land once again be restored. 
If we do not meet again, remember you always have my eternal thanks.'</P>

<P>Faelin gives you "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('swiftwind-old')">Swiftwind</A>," which identifies as Blessed by the Earth Goddess, then 
despawns.</P>

<P><B>Strike Directly Against Innoruuk</B></P>

<P>Go to the Plane of Hate and slay Innoruuk for the
"<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('shattered_emerald_of_corruption-old')">Shattered Emerald of Corruption</A>." This will require a guild raid to 
complete, but should be encounters themselves should be easy in comparison to some of the other mobs you have encountered.</P>

<P>Innoruuk<BR>
Level: 65<BR>
Class: Wizard</P>

<P>Tactics:<BR>
Since Innoruuk likes to Gravity Flux a lot, levitation-type spells help a lot in this fight. Keeping your back to a wall also helps as you do not want to be 
pushed far and possibly into areas which have mobs still.</P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
Although the wording of the quest tells you to make a strike against Innoruuk directly, he no longer drops the Shattered Emerald of Corruption every time. 
It is now a random/rare drop from any of the sub-boss mobs in the Plane of Hate in addition to being a random/rare drop from Innoruuk. If you are on a 
Plane of Hate raid, I strongly recommend killing all sub-boss mobs just to increase the chances of getting this particular drop. Mobs that are known to drop 
the Shattered Emerald of Corruption are: Innoruuk, Ashenbone Broodmaster, Avatar of Abhorrence, Coercer T`vari, Grandmaster R`tal, High Priest M'kari, 
Lord of Ire, Lord of Loathing, Maestro of Rancor, Magi P`tasa and Mistress of Scorn.</P>

<P><B>Xanuusus in North Karana, Antonica</B></P>

<P>Xanuusus can be found toward the North end of the zone, along the mountains.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Xanuusus'<BR>
Xanuusus says 'Greetings, small one! I am Xanuusus of the Stormreapers. You are welcome to rest beneath my mighty branches.</P>

<P>*Give Xanuusus the Refined Mithril Blade and the Shattered Emerald of Corruption to receive Earthcaller.*<BR>
Xanuusus waves his hands over the gem of corruption and a wave of warm energy passes through the area. With care for such a huge creature, he melds 
the gem into the sword and seems to glow all over as he channels energy into the weapon. 'Thus is the link of hate broken between Innoruuk and the spirit 
of earth. Through your will has balance returned. Your deeds, your work for the good of all, will be remembered by anyone who walks beneath the canopy 
of a forest or roams the plains. Continue your vigil over nature's balance.'</P>

<P>Xanuusus gives you "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('earthcaller-old')">Earthcaller</A>," which identifies as Blessed by the Storm Lord.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Faction</B></P>

<P>NPC Factions:<BR>
- Alrik Farsight [Timorous Deep]: Keepers of the Art<BR>
- Althele [East Karana]: JaggedPine Treefolk<BR>
- Ella Foodcrafter [Misty Thicket]: Stormreapers<BR>
- Faelin [Burning Woods]: Soldiers of Tunare<BR>

- Human Skeleton [Frontier Mountains]: Beta Neutral<BR>
- Kinlo Strongarm [Kaladim]: Kazon Stormhammer<BR>
- Jaeil the Wretched [The Hole]: True Spirit<BR>
- Mairee Silentone [Erudin]: True Spirit<BR>
- Merchant Nora [Felwithe]: Merchants of Felwithe<BR>
- Merdan Fleetfoot [Surefall Glade]: Protectors of Pine<BR>
- Niera Farbreeze [Surefall Glade]: Protectors of Pine<BR>
- Nuien East [Karana]: JaggedPine Treefolk<BR>
- Sionae East [Karana]: JaggedPine Treefolk<BR>

- Teloa East [Karana]: JaggedPine Treefolk<BR>

- Usbak the Old [Kaladim]: Kazon Stormhammer<BR>
- Venril Sathirs remains [Karnor's Castle] Beta Neutral<BR>
- Xanuusus [North Karana]: Stormreapers</P>

<P>Beta Neutral<BR>
This would cover the Human Skeleton, Venril Sathirs remains and Spirit of Venril Sathir all of which are indifferent to everyone. There are no faction issues 
to worry about with these NPCs.</P>

<P>Faydark's Champions: Kelethin Ranger Guild<BR>
Telin Darkforest is the only NPC in the quest on Faydark's Champions faction. Any of the Kelethin Ranger quests will give you faction with him. You can also 
kill orcs in Crushbone. Giving Small Lanterns to Jyle Windshot in West Freeport will give you faction with both Telin Darkforest and with Faelin Bloodbriar. 
You can also give muffins to Pandros in West Freeport for faction.</P>

<P>Indigo Brotherhood: Dark Elf Warrior Guild [for evil friends]<BR>
This isn't a faction that is critical for rangers, but it may be important for evil friends who wish to aide the cause of nature by assisting in the fight against 
these mobs as the Indigo Brotherhood is the Neriak Warrior guild. Killing these mobs will not impact faction with the Neriak Guards nor any of the other 
Neriak guilds.

<P>JaggedPineTreefolk: Surefall Glades Druid Guild<BR>
This would cover Althele, Tholris, Fang, Sionae, Nuien and Teloa. I am estimating that they are all on JaggedPineTreefolk faction. While I don't have 100% 
proof of this, there are several things which support this theory. I have spoken with rangers that were had good faction with both the Soldiers of Tunare 
and Stormreapers, yet Althele wanted to kill them. The treants and generic druids in this zone are also based on this faction. Killing gnolls in Blackburrow is 
perhaps the best way to raise this faction.</P>

<P>Kazon Stormhammer: The Dwarf King<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm & Usbak the Old are both on some Kaladim based faction. When I did this quest myself, they both were apprehensive to me. During a more 
recent trip through Kaladim, I found that Kinlo Strongarm considered amiable to me. The only factioning I had preformed in Kaladim between that time was 
giving Bone Chips Gunlok Jure in the Paladin's Guild. This raises faction with Kazon StormHammer, Miners Guild 249 and the Clerics of Underfoot. I find it highly 
unlikely that they are on cleric faction and Miners Guild 249 specifically supports the cleric and paladin guilds. (There is another miner's guild that specifically 
supports the rogues.) Allakhazam's site classifies Kinlo as being on Truespirit faction, which I believe is wrong as I've known rangers where were kill on sight 
to Kinlo Strongarm. If your faction with these dwarves is less than indifferent, I recommend just standing behind them and use sneak in order to be able to 
deal with them.</P>

<P>Keepers of the Art: Felwithe Magicians Guild<BR>
Alrik Farsight and Farios Elianos are both on Keepers of the Art faction. To gain faction, visit the Magician Guild in Felwithe [B] and give Niola Impholder Bat 
Wings until she is amiable to you. If your faction with Niola Impholder is so low that she will not give you faction when you turn them in, stand behind her 
and use sneak to make her indifferent to you then proceed to give her Bat Wings. Remember to stop sneaking every so often to check your faction with her. 
Bat Wings can be purchased from merchants in either East Commons or the Bazaar.</P>

<P>Merchants of Felwithe: Felwithe Merchants<BR>
Merchant Nora is most likely on the Felwithe Merchant faction. Unless you have been doing things to lower you faction with the city of Felwithe, your 
faction should be sufficient. Should you wish to raise your faction with her, the only way to do so would be through quests with the Emerald Warriors, which 
is the Kelethin Warrior Guild.</P>

<P>Plane of Growth<BR>
Although the Plane of Growth is not used for the quest, it does need special mentioning. Hunting here, will lower faction with Faydark's Champions [Kelethin 
Rangers] and Soldiers of Tunare [Kelethin Druids.] This specifically will effect your dealings with Telin Darkforest, Faelin, Faelin Bloodbriar and Foloal 
Stormforest.</P>

<P>Protectors of Pine: Surefall Glades Rangers<BR>
Merdan Fleetfoot and Niera Farbreeze are most likely on Protectors of the Pine faction. Merdan Fleetfoot tells you he is a ranger so he should be on this 
faction. Niera Farbreeze looks more like a ranger than a druid, so I am guessing she is as well. As a ranger, you should not be having faction issues here 
unless you have been killing stuff that you should not be.</P>

<P>Soldiers of Tunare: Kelethin Druid Guild<BR>
Faelin, Faelin Bloodbriar and Foloal Stormforest are on Soldiers of Tunare, which is the Kelethin Druid Guild. The best way to obtain faction with is to either 
give Small Lanterns to Jyle Windshot or muffins to Pandros, both of which are in West Freeport. You would think that Althele, the wood elf druid in East 
Karana would also be on this faction, but she is not.</P>

<P>Stormreapers: Rivervale Druid Guild<BR>
Ella Foodcrafter and Xanuusus are both on Stormreapers faction. There are a few mobs in the lowest level that give Stormreaper faction along with a few 
in the Beholder Maze. Alternatively, you can also do quests with the Rivervale Druids if you are not outright kill on sight with them.</P>

<P>True Spirit: Epic Faction<BR>
It is theorized that Mairee Silentone is on True Spirit faction as gaining faction with other parts of Erudin does not seem to effect her. Jaeil the Wretched 
in The Hole is also most likely on True Spirit faction due to his tendency to be less than indifferent, but not outright kill on sight.</P>

<P>Venril Sathir: Venril Sathir and Teir'Dal Outpost<BR>
This faction would only impact those wishing to maintain good faction with the Teir'Dal Outpost in The Overthere. Evil friends that are willing to assist with 
your epic but want to keep their faction with the outpost may want to limit the number of Venril Sathir raids they help out on. There are ways to regain this 
faction, but I have not researched them greatly.</P>

<P>Unknown Faction: Giz X`Tin<BR>
What faction Giz X'Tin is on remains a mystery. I found him to be dubious to me when I did this quest, and I am KOS to all of Neriak. Since you will most 
likely have less than indifferent faction with him, the best way to deal with Giz X'Tin is to not worry about what faction he is really on. Just cast Spirit of 
Wolf on yourself [to be able to keep up with him] than sneak up behind him so that he will be indifferent to you and give him Faelin's Ring. If you give him 
the ring, while he /CONs dubious [or lower] to you, you will not get the coin to continue the quest.</P>

<P><B>Changes to the Quest</B></P>

<P>This section is mostly an archive that documents the various changes that occurred to the epic quest. Unfortunately, I do not have patch date 
information.</P>

<P>Pulsing Green Stone and Jade Reaver:<BR>
The Pulsing Green Stone originally did not drop every time from Venril Sathir and only one dropped. This resulted in some complaints as rangers and druids 
were put in a rather awkward position of having to compete with each other for the drop. The first change to the epic quest was that the drop rate of the 
Pulsing Green Stone was increased to drop every time and two dropped at that. Unfortunately, the drop rate on Jade Reavers was stealth nerfed at the 
same time.</P>

<P>Venril Sathirs remains Part 1:<BR>
While increasing the drop rate of the Pulsing Green Stones helped to release some of the tension involved here, it became common practice for guilds to 
monopolize the spawns thus forcing rangers and druids of other guilds into a position of having to buy either a multiquest or loot rights to the Pulsing Green 
Stone. Venril Sathirs remains was added so that guilds going after Venril Sathir for the leg armor would be able to leave the remains for others needing the 
epic drop. Unfortunately since Venril Sathirs remains spawned right after Venril Sathir died, it became common practice to kill Venril Sathir then trigger him 
again right after so as to be able to sell the epic drop.</P>

<P>Venril Sathirs remains Part 2:<BR>
Since the original fix involving Venril Sathirs remains did not resolve the situation, Venril Sathirs remains was put on a random spawn timer where he would 
randomly spawn after Venril Sathir was killed. The remains would the respawn randomly after the triggered Venril Sathir was killed.</P>

<P>Innoruuk Upgraded:<BR>
The next change to the epic quest involved the upgrading of the two gods Innoruuk and Cazic Thule who as they were proving to be far less than godly. 
The Shattered Emerald of Corruption which previously was a guaranteed drop off of Innoruuk every time now became an random drop off of either Innoruuk 
or off any of the "mini bosses."</P>

<P>Easier Foraging:<BR>
More recently the requirement of needing "Master" skill in foraging to get any of the foraged epic items was removed thus making it possible for a ranger 
with skill less than 100 to obtain these. Also, the likelihood of actually foraging these was increased. Previously, it was not unheard of for a ranger to spend 
many hours on end just trying to get one of the forages. They are now foraged with little difficulty.</P>

<P>Halfling Rangers:<BR>
Halflings were giving the ability to be rangers thus the halfling race was added to the epics themselves and to several ranger equipable sub-items in the 
quest that were previously only equipable by humans, elves and half elves.</P>

<P>Plane of Hate Revamp:<BR>
While the Plane of Hate itself was revamped, this posed no change to the Shattered Emerald of Corruption. It still randomly drops off of either Innoruuk or 
any of the mini bosses.</P>

<P>Jaeil the Wretched:<BR>
This change was not announced in any patch, and I discovered it on my own during my last run on this portion of the epic quest. When Jaeil the Insane is 
spawned, Jaeil the Wretched now despawns. Additionally, he does not respawn immediately afterwards. I couldn't tell you how long the respawn time is as 
I didn't stick around to camp him and find out.</P>

<P><B>Credits</B></P>

<P>Special thanks goes to the following:</P>

<P>Kobalt Truepath [Druzzil Ro]:<BR>
Besides leading the way and being the first ranger on any server with Swiftwind and Eartcaller, he also told us how to do the final turn in.</P>

<P>Barnard Hunter [Karana/Ayonae Ro Server]:<BR>
For being a major source of information and help me by fill in many information gaps; he has also been a great source of inspiration. [P.S. Congrats to being 
the first ranger on the Karana Server to get both Swiftwind and Earthcaller.] It can be noted that this great ranger who retired at one point, has since 
returned to Norrath.</P>

<P>Sean the Scaled Claw [Veeshan]:<BR>
When someone posted that the Ancient Longsword needed to be combined in a forge with a Shapening Stone, it was this ranger who took the hudge leap 
of faith which ultimately which proved this information to be false. Safeguards against combines that resulted in nothing did not exist at the time, so he 
was forced to start the quest over thus this was one of the greatest sacrifices made that lead to the solving of the quest.</P>

<P>Dracodiva [Xev]:<BR>
For providing me with the long missing inventory screen shots for the Resurection Spell and Shiny Tin Bowl.</P>

<P>Much thanks and acknowledgements goes to a great many rangers and some druids as well who have shared their thoughts, ideas and speculations that
