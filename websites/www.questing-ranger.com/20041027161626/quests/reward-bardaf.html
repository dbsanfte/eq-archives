<P><B>Bard Artifact Quests</B></P>

<P><B>Painful Memory</B> [Bard AF1]<BR>
Client: Mertaire<BR>
Location: Merry Minstrel Meadhouse, Lower Jeuno [I-8]<BR>
Requirements: Level 40+ Bard<BR>
Reward: Paper Knife</P>

<P>You'll need to get a party and head to Rangemont Pass, then go to [D-5]. You'll find a pool of water here, and clicking on the "???" will spawn the notorious monster Tros. 
You'll need to fight Tros. Both Barwatera and Water Carol will help due the the water-based AE that he does. Once Tros is dead, inspect the "???" again. Mertaire will show up 
and give you the Paper Knife.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>The Requiem</B> [Bard AF2]<BR>
Client: Bki Tbujhja<BR>
Location: Merry Minstrel Meadhouse [I-8]<BR>
Requirements: Painful Memory, Level 50+ Bard<BR>
Reward: Choral Slippers</P>

<P>After you talk to Bki Tbujhja, get some Holy Water then talk to her a second time. You'll now need a full alliance. You can get away with about two parties instead of the full 
three if you have some high level people helping. You'll now want to go to Eldieme Necropolis, but must go to the area which requires you to travel to Beaudice Glacier. Once 
here, sneak your way to [D-4] and clear all the mobs in the room. Put sneak up again then inspect all the coffins in the room until three NMs spawn. You only need to kill the 
Owl Guard to pass this, but this depends on if you manage to pull him by himself. With this mob [or all three] dead, inspect the coffin again for a Star Ring. Return to the 
Merry Minstrel Meadhouse and talk to Bki Tbujhja again to get the Choral Slippers.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>The Circle of Time</B> [Bard AF3] - <I>incomplete</I><BR>
Client: Imasuke<BR>
Location: Qufim Tunnel [E-6]<BR>
Requirements: The Requiem<BR>
Reward: Choral Justacorps</P>

<P>Imasuke shows interest in the Star Ring [key item] that you obtained from the spirit towards the end of "The Requiem." You'll need to take the ring to Xarcabard and bury it 
in the snow at [I-10.] There are several high level mobs in this tunnel, but you can sneak past them easily. You'll now need to wait until the next real life day to dig it out. Once 
you have the ring back, return to Imasuke and talk to him again.</P>
