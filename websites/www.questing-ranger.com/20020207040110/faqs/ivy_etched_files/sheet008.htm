<P><B>Quiver of Kithicor</B></P>

<P>The Quiver of Kithicor drops off Wiltin Windwalker on Gornit Isle in Ocean of Tears. This item is a container, so you will need to have a 
General Inventory slot free when you finally get to loot it. If you do not, it will poof as the item is no drop and will not be able to fall to the 
ground. This may have been corrected as I have seen no drop items drop to my cursor when I didn't have room for them. I would not depend 
on this happening and just have the space for it.</P>

<P>Wiltin Windwalker's placeholder is a Buccaneer. Do not attack the Buccaneer as you could end up waiting two hours for a respawn. If you 
camp Wiltin Windwalker without attacking the Buccaneer, the Buccaneer will despawn after an hour. Either Wiltin Windwalker or the 
Buccaneer will spawn a few minutes later. The Buccaneer is very common and Wiltin Windwindwalker is rare. Camping him is more of a test of 
patience than anything else.</P>

<P><B>The Six Named Arrows</B></P>

<P>The six named arrows are random drops off the Brownie Outcasts in Lesser Faydark. They all spawn near the pixie tower, which is not far 
from the fairie village. The pixies in this area are place holders for the Brownie Outcasts so be sure to kill them as well.</P>

<P>The arrows are lore, so it is not possible to accidently get two of the same arrow. However, the arrows you need are: Acknowledgment, 
Bravery, Defiance, Gallantry, Fortitude and Recognition. Place one of each arrow in the Quiver of Kithicor, and combine the quiver to get the 
"Quiver of Kithicor - full"</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Star of Odus</B></P>

<P>Go to the jewlrey shop in Erudin and buy a Star of Odus. This is not sold anywhere else in Norrath.</P>

<P><B>Ivy Etched Leggings</B></P>

<P>Give Leaf Falldim the "Quiver of Kithicor - full" and the Star of Odus to receive the Ivy Etched Leggings.</P>
