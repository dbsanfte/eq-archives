<P><B>Broken Bow Part A</B></P>

<P>Broken Bow Part A drops off Maldyn the Unkempt in Rathetear Mountains. Camping Maldyn the Unkempt is a multi-part problem, which I 
will go over individually.</P>

<P>There are three possible place holders: a drake, Hasten Bootstrutter and Brother Zephyl. The drake and Hasten Bootstrutter are the most 
common place holders. Brother Zephyl is the rare place holder, but he is still more common than Maldyn the Unkempt. The drake will be easy 
to kill and should cause no problems. Hasten Bootstrutter and Brother Zephyl will be impossible for anyone of level range to do these quests. 
Hasten is around Level 40. If you are lucky, there will be either some high level evil people who like the faction free fun or a high level ranger 
who has a deep resentment of Hasten due to this quest. In either case, Hasten will be killed for you. Brother Zephyl on the other hand is 
Level 60. He is a mob/npc for the Robe of the Lost Circle, which is a sub-part of the Monk Epic Quest. The only thing that will get rid of him 
fast is if some monk comes through and decides he wants to kill Brother Zephyl for the robe. Otherwise, he will be up for hours before he 
finally despawns.</P>

<P>The second part of the problem is that Maldyn the Unkempt has a bad habbit of getting himself killed. He spawns near the guard tower 
in the main hill giant area. If you don't get to him fast, something will come along and kill him.</P>

<P><B>Broken Bow Part B</B></P>

<P>Broken Bow Part B drops of Slaythe the Slayer in the "live side" of Lower Guk. Don't let the whole "live side" and "dead side" thing fool you 
if you have never been there before. This is all one zone and sometimes undead mobs that look like zombie frogloks wander into the live area. 
Slaythe the Slayer spawns in a dead end near the jail area. Although I have read that he is on a spawn/despawn cycle and has a place 
holder, I have always seen him on tracking.</P>

<HR>

<P>Give Broken Bow Part A and Broken Bow Part B to Leaf Falldim to receive the Ivy Etched Gauntlets. It can be noted that although you 
are recovering parts of a broken bow, it is not possible for you to put it back together.</P>
