<P><B>Planes of Power Progression FAQ</B><BR>
by Crydee Ossiriand, Torvonnilous Server<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.questing-ranger.com">http://www.questing-ranger.com</A><BR>
Version: 2004.06.01</P>

<P>Please note that while most chapters can be done out of the order listed either by having access to multiple zones at once or through virtual 
flagging, it is generally best to complete all parts of a chapter within the order that is listed to avoid any issues that may arise later from flags being 
missing. Additionally although many of the lower planes will automatically open themselves up after you gain certain experience levels, it is still necessary 
to do the entire progression quest to properly unlock the planes if you wish to be able to walk into any of the elemental planes without the aide of being 
virtual flagged in through a raid.</P>

<P>Chapters are broken down as follows and cover the following areas:<BR>
- Chapter 1: The Council of Justice [Plane of Justice]<BR>
- Chapter 2: The Dream Scorcher [Plane of Nightmares, Lair of Terris Thule]<BR>
- Chapter 3: The Plaguebringer [Plane of Disease, Crypt of Decay]<BR>
- Chapter 4: The Truthbringer [Plane of Valor, Halls of Honor, Temple of Marr]<BR>
- Chapter 5: The Mistress of Torment &amp; Pain [Plane of Torment]<BR>
- Chapter 6: The Rain Keeper [Plane of Storms, Bastion of Thunder]<BR>
- Chapter 7: The Warlord [Plane of Innovation, Plane of Tactics]<BR>
- Chapter 8: The Burning Prince [Tower of Solusek Ro]<BR>
- Chapter 9: The Tryant of Fire [Plane of Fire]<BR>
- Chater 10: The Queen of Air [Plane of Air]<BR>
- Chapter 11: The Avatar of Water [Plane of Water]<BR>
- Chapter 12: The Council of Twelve [Plane of Earth]<BR>
- Chapter 13: The Forsaken [Plane of Innovation, Plane of Time]</P>

<P>It can be noted that Chapters 1 - 8 cover the lower teir planes. Most of these chapters function idependently of each other with a few exceptions. 
Chapter 5 [Saryrn] requires the completion of Chapter 2 [Terris Thule] and Chapter 3 [Bertoxxulous.] Chapter 8 and being able to fight Rallos Zek himself 
in Chater 7 both require that you have done all other lower tier chapters. Chapters 9 - 12 all cover the elemental planes and can be completed in any order 
as they are essentially independent of each other.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Chapter 1: The Council of Justice</B><BR>

<P>There are technically two quests in this chapter. The first is to gain access to the Plane of Storms and Plane of Valor, which leads on towards 
progression. The second is to gain access to the Seventh Hammer, which is a side quest and not required for progression.</P>

<P><B>Part 1 - Mavuin, Plane of Justice</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Mavuin'<BR>
Mavuin strains his eyes to look up at you in disbelief, then reaches down into a rusted vent and pulls out a journal. 'Please I implore you, take word to the 
Tribunal. I have done nothing wrong, yet I have been sentenced to eternity in this cell. I wish to present all of the [information] about my case to them. 
They must listen to my plea if they are truly the gods of justice.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What information?'<BR>
Mavuin tells you, 'I know it has been said for years before me, and will be said for years after me, but I was truly framed for my crime. You see the gods 
feared the knowledge that I carry with me. So to prevent me passing this knowledge to others, it was set up to show that I had plotted to murder one of 
the other elders. Please go before the tribunal and plead my case. If you do this I will share what I know with you, I apologize for holding it against you, 
but I am desperate to be released.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Part 2 - The Tribunal, Plane of Justice</B></P>

<P>At this point you will need to go to where The Tribunal are and complete any trial. If you hail one of them, The Tribunal will tell you which trial he 
activates. While there are six trials in total, you only need to complete any one trial for progression. Trials are all one-group events.</P>

<P>Once you find a trial that you want to do, just target The Tribunal and say "ready trial <name of trial>." For example, if you wanted to do lashing, 
you would say "ready trial lashing" without the quotes. Once you have completed the trial, loot the mark then say "return" to the tribunal in the trial area 
to talk to any of The Tribunal for the flag.</P>

<P>You say, 'I have evidence from Mavuin'<BR>
You have received a character flag!<BR>
The Tribunal tells you, 'You have completed a trial - impressive for mortals. You can tell Mavuin that we will hear his plea. We will seek him out as time 
befits us.'</P>

<P><B>Part 3 - Mauvin, Plane of Justice</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Mavuin'<BR>
Mavuin tells you, 'So you have pleaded my case to the Tribunal, I am most thankful. I hope that they will listen to my case soon and release me. The 
knowledge that I promised you is this. The followers in the Plane of Tranquility are trying to find information on what has happened to Zebuxoruk. What I 
know is that he has been captured for a second time. If you want to find out more information I believe you should seek an audience with Karana and 
Mithaniel Marr. I can only assume that they were present at the time of his capture and know why this has taken place. Also seek from Marr a way to 
translate the divine language. Only with it can you understand the writing of the gods. There is no more that I can tell you, but thank you once again 
for your attempt in returning my freedom.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Side Quest - The Seventh Hammer</B></P>

<P>To gain access to The Seventh Hammer, you will need to complete all six of the trials and gain the mark for each, then speak to any one of The 
Tribunal. Keep in mind as I stated previously, this is completely unnecessary for advancement.</P>

<P>You say, 'I seek knowledge'<BR>
The Tribunal tells you, 'Most impressive. It has been long since a mortal has shown such prowess.' It considers you for a long moment. 'There is one final 
test that you must undergo.' A gleaming metal disc appears in your hand. 'Hold up the Mark of Justice as you enter the portal, and prepare for your 
judgement.'</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Chapter 2: The Dream Scorcher</B></P>

<P>This chapter concerns gaining access to Terris Thule's lair where you will eventually fight her. Completing this chapter will result in you gaining access 
to the Plane of Torment.</P>

<P><B>Part 1 - Adroha Jezith, Plane of Tranquility</B></P>

<P>Adroha Jezith can be found in the sick house in the Plane of Tranquility. Thelin Poxborn, is lying next to where she is sitting.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Adroha Jezith'<BR>
Adroha dabs Thelin's forehead with a cold towel and looks up to you, her gentle features veiled in concern. Her voice is gentle and sweet in its hushed 
tones as she gently returns to your greetings, 'Poor, poor Thelin. I wonder if he will ever recover from opening the portal to the Nightmare plane. I hope 
he will recover. That seems to be all we have right now, hope. Perhaps you should move along, traveler, and leave the suffering elders to their rest.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what portal'<BR>
Adroha Jezith says 'My pity onto Thelin. His life on Norrath was a miserable one. As a young man he began to study the workings of fear inspired by 
Cazic-Thule. The workings had been translated for mortals by Zebuxoruk. Pouring over the texts, Thelin felt his mind being invaded by Cazic. This 
information was not for mortal usage and the malevolent god stripped him of all his earthly belongings and cursed him to live in [poverty and ruin].'</P>

<P>You say, 'what poverty and ruin?'<BR>
Adroha Jezith says 'Aye, he lived in the streets of Eastern Freeport, begging from those passing through the port. He sat quivering, propped up against a 
wall with one hand out as he watched the travelers pass by. None of them even gave him a second glance. Several years would pass before a female 
dwarf would arrive to trade some of her family's armor and weapons. She saw and took pity on Thelin. She knelt down, scratched her beard then began to 
rummage through her backpack. She then placed a [jeweled dagger] in his hand, smiled and returned to her former business.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what jeweled dagger?'<BR>
Adroha Jezith says 'This was the only gift that Thelin had received since the curse. It was beautifully crafted and would likely have fetched a handsome 
price upon the market. He decided to keep the dagger as it was such a kind gesture. Later that eve, Thelin heard the calling of others that studied 
Zebuxoruk's workings. He recognized the language they called out in. He approached the men and explained he had studied the writings of Zebuxoruk. One 
of the shaded figures then began to mutter an incantation. Suddenly, there was a bright flash, lush vegetation and a peaceful breeze surrounded them. 
They had ascended here, to the [Plane of Tranquility] where they could further study the works without interference from the gods and mortals alike.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what plane of tranquility?'<BR>
Adroha Jezith says 'Thelin enjoyed it here. He assisted the other followers by using all his mana to open a portal to the Plane of Nightmares, the demi-plane 
ruled by the child of The Faceless, Terris-Thule. Spent from using all his energies, he went to bed early after his victory had been achieved in this task. As 
he laid in bed, he looked over the dagger that had been given to him by the female dwarf. He smiled at the new peace he had found here and began to fall 
asleep. Drifting away into the realm of dreams, his subconscious was assulted by the horrors of a nightmare. He tossed and turned from the visions that 
came before him. So bad did he writhe in his subconscious torment that he turned on the dagger. He was critically injured, and let out a wrenching scream. 
We found him and were able to heal his wound enough to keep him alive. However, he still lies in a deep coma seemingly [tortured by nightmares].'</P>

<P>You say, 'tortured by nightmares'<BR>
You have received a character flag!<BR>
Adroha Jezith tells you, 'It is our belief that Terris-Thule is punishing him for allowing entrance into her plane. She seems to have an exceedingly strong tie 
to him. Since her father has already punished him, she likely found that he was easily tormented by her own powers. Sometimes he talks while tossing and 
turning. We have taken note of everything he has said. He has said 'I accept your offer Terris-Thule', 'I must find the pieces', and 'It never ends'. You must 
help him. Go through the portal that he has helped to create. Try to find his planar projection in Terris' plane. Help him wake from this torment. Please, I 
beg you. I cannot stand to watch him suffer any longer.'</P>

<P><B>Part 2 - Thelin Poxbourne, Plane of Nightmares</B></P>

<P>You will now want to go to the hedge in the Plane of Nightmares. It can be found along the left wall past the river. This part is a three group raid 
event. When you're ready to do the event, have each group leader target Thelin Poxbourne and say "i am ready" [without quotes.] This will port each 
group inside the maze, where Thelin Poxborne will be waiting. Once all groups are inside the maze, it will be necessary to have someone say "i am ready" 
to him to activate the event.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Thelin Poxbourne'<BR>
*dialogue missing*</P>

<P>You say, 'what dagger'<BR>
*dialogue missing*</P>

<P>You say, 'what help'<BR>
Thelin Poxbourne says 'Thelin Poxbourne tells you, 'I do not know who you are, but I am thankful that you have stumbled upon me. I can bring you into my 
dream state, but my powers are limited so I can only handle eighteen at once. Please when you are prepared have the leader of each of your band of 
adventurers tell me they are ready.''</P>

<P>You say, 'i am ready'<BR>
Thelin Poxbourne says 'Thelin Poxbourne closes his eyes and falls asleep immediately. He looks peaceful for a moment and then screams in agony!'</P>

<P>This will port you into the maze where Thelin will be waiting.<BR>
Thelin Poxbourne says 'Has everyone made it here safely? When you tell me I will seal off my dream and we can begin. We must be careful here, visions 
await around every turn. Are you ready to follow? I know where all the pieces of the dagger are, but I cannot collect them all on my own.'</P>

<P>You say, 'ready'<BR>
Thelin Poxbourne says 'Please stay close, I know not what horror Terris will unleash upon us.'</P>

<P>This last "ready" will actually activate the hedge maze event. Each time he finds part of his dagger, monsters will spawn and more each time. Finally he 
will lead you to a fountain, were a Construct of Nightmares [the maze boss] will spawn. Once this is defeated, somone will need to loot the Dagger Blade 
Shard on it and give it to Thelin Poxbourne. There will be be a brief emote message and he will head towards an illusion of Terris Thule that appears [which 
is not targetable.] Hail Thelin when you are ready to leave as this will give you a flag and port you out of the maze.<BR>
You will also be flagged for the Lair of Terris Thule [Nightmares B.]</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Thelin Poxbourne'<BR>
Thelin Poxbourne tells you, 'Please destroy her for all that have had to endure her hideous visions.' Thelin closes his eyes and is swept away from his 
nightmare. The land of pure thought begins to vanish from around you.<BR>
You have received a character flag!<BR>
You feel the world of dreams collapse around you.</P>

<P><B>Part 3 - Terris Thule, Lair of Terris Thule</B></P>

<P>This next part is a raid event. You will need to go through the Plane of Nightmares to get to the Lair of Terris Thule, then fight through this zone to get 
to Terris Thule herself. With Terris defeated, a planar projection spawns.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, A Planar Projection'<BR>
You recognize the voice in your mind to be Thelin Poxbourne's. The words echo, 'The cruel hand of Terris no longer shall torment my dreams. Thank you 
friends, you are my savior. Please return to me in the Plane of Tranquility. I would like to express to you my gratitude.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Part 4 - Elder Poxbourne, Plane of Tranquility</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Elder Poxbourne'<BR>
Thelin tells you, 'I apologize but I cannot stand to greet you. I am still quite weak and recovery will be a long and painful road, though it is a most welcome 
venture. I want you to know how much I appreciate your bravery in helping me. I am forever in your debt.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Chapter 3: The Plaguebringer</B></P>

<P>This chapter concerns gaining access to the Crypt of Decay, so that you can fight Bertoxxulous. Completing this chapter will result in you being able 
to obtain the flag from Saryrn.</P>

<P><B>Part 1 - Adler Fuirstel, Plane of Tranquility</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Adler Fuirstel'<BR>
Adler Fuirstel tells you, 'Can you smell it?  It is the musk of death and pestilence. It is a smell that I have welcomed for so long, but now it turns my 
stomach. My brother Milyk and I have come here from Qeynos. We were members of the Bloodsabers but sought higher enlightenment. Upon arriving here 
Milyk began to channel all of his energy into opening the portal to the Plane of Disease.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what plane of disease'<BR>
Adler Fuirstel tells you, 'We sought only the wisdom of Bertoxxulous. When Milyk finished his chant and the portal opened, it began to spew out this vile 
pestilence you see before you. Milyk caught the brunt of the plague, and his condition worsens. I have been infected as well, and am weak but I will go 
into the plane to save my brother if I must. The weavers have seen in their tapestries that one holds a ward that will halt the effects of the toxins that 
the touch of Bertoxxulous brings.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what ward?'<BR>
Adler Fuirstel tells you, 'The ward is carried by the one that Bertoxxulous has created to protect the entrance into his den. If you dare travel into this 
pungent plane and find the ward bring it back. If we can halt the advancing toxins in Milyk's system maybe we can save him.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Part 2 - Grummus, Plane of Disease</B></P>

<P>You will now need a raid to fight Grummus, and A Planar Projection will be spawned upon his defeat.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, A Planar Projection'<BR>
You recognize the sound of the voice echoing in your mind to be Milyk Fuirstel's. He tells you before fading, 'I beg of you, return to me with the ward that 
now envelops your body. This etheric energy is the only thing that can stop this plague that has been placed upon me.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Part 3 - Elder &amp; Adler Fuirstel, Plane of Tranquility</B></P>

<P>You will now want to talk to Elder Fuirstel, who can be found inside the sick house in the Plane of Tranquility.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Elder Fuirstel'<BR>
Elder Fuirstel slowly turns towards you. You can feel the heat radiating from his face. The warding that envelopes your body reaches out and begins to 
surround him. You immediately see improvement in his condition. The pus filled sores covering his face and his burning fever start to vanish. 'Thank you 
friend. I no longer feel the touch of death on my soul. However I do feel the grasp on Bertoxxulous, his plague is still upon me but not spreading throughout 
my body. I fear the only way to remove this pox would be to weaken Bertoxxulous enough that his curse would be lifted. I now renounce my faith in 
Bertoxxulous, please fell this god so that I may continue and learn from my mistakes.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P>After getting the flag from Elder Fuirstel, you will want to return to Alder Fuirstel near the zone-in to the Plane of Decay.</P>

<P>You say, 'what plane of disease'<BR>
Adler Fuirstel tells you, 'We sought only the wisdom of Bertoxxulous. When Milyk finished his chant and the portal opened, it began to spew out this vile 
pestilence you see before you. Milyk caught the brunt of the plague, and his condition worsens. I have been infected as well, and am weak but I will go 
into the plane to save my brother if I must. The weavers have seen in their tapestries that one holds a ward that will halt the effects of the toxins that the 
touch of Bertoxxulous brings.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what ward?'<BR>
Adler Fuirstel tells you, 'The ward is carried by the one that Bertoxxulous has created to protect the entrance into his den. If you dare travel into this 
pungent plane and find the ward bring it back. If we can halt the advancing toxins in Milyk's system maybe we can save him.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Part 4 - Tarkil Adan, Ruins of Lxanvom</B></P>

<P>This next part is a ring event in the upper section of the Ruins of Lxanvom [Crypt of Decay] that requires a raid force to complete. You start by killing 
Abroan Drian, Breddan Rutyl and Fran Prisoal to spawn Carprin Deatharn. When you defeat him, Avhi Escron will spawn somewhere deeper in the zone. 
You'll then need to fight your way to him and kill Avhi Escron to spawn Bishop Toluwon. Taking him out spawns, Raex Pwodill and Vindor Mawnil. You'll need 
to defeat both of them to spawn High Priest Ultor Szanvon. Once the high prist is take out, Tarkil Adan spawn. You need to stand very close to him in order 
to get the message when you hail him. You will not get a flag message but "Key to the lower depths of the Ruins of Lxanvom" will be listed if you type /key. 
Additionally this event will only flag up to 36 people at a time, so it will be necessary to do it more than once.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Tarkil Adan'<BR>
Tarkil Adan lets out a groan and then whimpers saying, 'Yes great ones yesss I was king once I wasss. ' The creature then mutters under his breath and 
passes you a small glowing bone fragment etched in runes. Then speaks again saying, 'The tortured ones oh the tortured ones, you must go to the depths 
of Lxanvom and free them. Go to the bone throne at the ruins entrance there you will find access to the depths.' He then goes back to whimpering and 
rocking back and forth.<BR>
The wretched creature whimpers and begins shaking in fear then whispers, 'Oooh massster, nooo massster!!!!' Then he vanishes into the nothing from which 
he came.</P>

<P><B>Part 5 - Bertoxxulous, Ruins of Lxanvom</B></P>

<P>The fight with Bertoxxulous is also a ring event, which takes place in the lower depths of the zone. You can access this area by clicking on the chair at 
the zone in after getting keyed from Tarkil Adan. For this event, you will need to defeat the twelve corrupted kings of Lxanvom as well as the rest of 
Bertoxxulous army. When the last king you fight is defeated, Bertoxxulous himself will show up. Defeat Bertoxxulous to spawn a planar projection.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, A Planar Projection'<BR>
Milyk Fuirstel's thoughts enter into your own. 'Bertoxxulous is slain, for this my brother and I are forever in your debt. Please, when you have the 
opportunity come visit me in the Plane of Tranquility. I would like to thank you face to face.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Part 6 - Elder Fuirstel, Plane of Tranquility</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Elder Fuirstel'<BR>
Elder Fuirstel tells you, 'Welcome back friend. I must tell you that my brother and I shall never forget what you have done for us. We have since renounced 
our following of Bertoxxulous, for in him we only found suffering. We have joined a new following, learning from the gods without their direct influence over 
us. I shall not keep you though, thank you once again!'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Chapter 4: The Truthbringer</B></P>

<P>This chapter concerns the Plane of Valor as well as gaining access to the Halls of Honor then Temple of Marr. The flag you get from defeating Mithaniel 
Marr is needed to fight Rallos Zek and enter the Tower of Solusek Ro.</P>

<P><B>Sub-Quest - A Crysyaline Globe</B></P>

<P>This section covers the entire sub-quest to get the key to Aerin`Dar's lair. This sub-quest takes place entirely in the Plane of Valor for both taking to 
NPCs and finding the quest drops. Technically only one person for an entire raid needs to complete this quest as the door can then be held open for 
everyone else.</P>

<P>Find Sergeant Johson Popoah and hail him twice.<BR>
*Dialogue here is missing.*</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Paralin Notion'<BR>
Paralin Notion says 'You're either [brave], or you're [stupid].'</P>

<P>You say, 'I am brave.'<BR>
Paralin Notion says 'That you are. Perhaps you'd be interested in helping our [company].'</P>

<P>You say, 'I will help your company.'<BR>
Paralin Notion says 'We're a part of the Battalion of Marr. We're soldiers from Che Virtuson. We were dispatched to this part of the Plane of Valor to 
eliminate an age old target. Unfortunately, due to some recent events our mission has been placed on hold and our [squad] has been asked to remain 
behind.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What squad?'<BR>
Paralin Notion says 'We are a part of Ducee Tapferson. Our squad is known for our bravery. We were successful in capturing this [razorfiend] earlier today. 
You've shown some bravery as well my friend and that is the reason I request your [assistance].'</P>

<P>You say, 'What about that razorfiend'<BR>
Paralin Notion says 'These vile beasts live in the caves west of here.'</P>

<P>You say, 'I will provide you with assistance'<BR>
Paralin Notion says 'Many of us here are anxious to leave. Many wish to regroup with the rest of our company. Others wish to go back to the Halls to 
complete the [Trials].'</P>

<P>You say, 'What trials?'<BR>
Paralin Notion says 'The Trials are overseen by the Heroes of Marr. It's these Trials that allow us to rise in rank. Only those who have passed the trials are 
able to enter the Temple of Marr. Now if you wish to aid us I must ask you to do a few [things].'</P>

<P>You say, 'What things?' <BR>
Paralin Notion says 'You must find the Master Sergeant and tell him that you are here to aid the cause.'</P>

<P>You will now want to talk to Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln. Don't bother hailing him first.</P>

<P>You say, 'I am here to aid the cause.'<BR>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln looks you over and says in a deep voice 'What could you possibly do to aid our cause. Perhaps you think you can slay 
[Aerin`Dar] himself?' The Master Sergeant begins to laugh uncontrollably. 'I suggest you go back to whoever filled your head with this nonsense and stop 
wasting my time.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What is Aerin'dar'<BR>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'I don't have time to explain the glass dragon to you. Leave before I get angry.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Paralin Notion'<BR>
Paralin Notion says 'I'm sorry the Master Sergeant was unable to help you. Perhaps you should [prove] yourself before you attempt to jump 'into the fire' so 
to speak.'</P>

<P>You say, 'How shall I prove myself'<BR>
Paralin Notion says 'We've been running into a lot of problems lately with the razorfiends and the planarian larvae. Many soldiers have been getting sick 
because of the infestations that they cause. Capture the hearts of a razorfiend, a crystalline spider and a planarian larvae and bring them back to me. Our 
squad had enough problems capturing this small razorfiend here. This will become your first so called 'Trial' Crydee. It should be enough to prove your 
worth.'</P>

<P>At this point you will need to collect three hearts that drop off mobs in this zone:<BR>
- A Crystalline Spider's Heart<BR>
- A Razorfiend's Heart<BR>
- A Planarian Larvae's Heart</P>

<P>Once you have all three, give them to Paralin Notion.<BR>
Paralin Notion looks at you with surprise. 'Very good my friend. You've definitely proven yourself. Find the Master Sergeant. He should be able to help you 
this time.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln'<BR>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'I heard what you did for Paralin Notion. That's quite a noble feat indeed. Perhaps we can use your help. However, 
you'll need to talk to the Captain first. After all, I can't have you walking in the [glass lair] without permission.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What glass lair'<BR>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'It's the prison that [Aerin`Dar] has been encased in for many generations.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What about Aerin'dar'<BR>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'Aerin`Dar is the crystalline dragon who once roamed the Plane of Valor. During a severe rainstorm it was struck down 
to the very core of its being. The mighty Aerin`Dar fell from the sky and landed in what is now known as the Glassy Wasteland. Planarian larvae began to 
infest its body eventually turning its pure heart to evil. Our [company] was dispatched to this region of Valor to eliminate the threat.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What company'<BR>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'My squad of men are a part of Che Virtuson. However, we specifically are a part of Ducee Buled. We fall under the 
command of Captain Ryglot. Our [mission], for the time being, is simple. But we've run into some problems lately.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What mission'<BR>
Master Sergeant Aaramis Daryln says 'Not too fast Crydee. You'll have to speak to the Captain about that. I'm not at liberty to divulge that information at 
this time. That information is classified. I can tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.' Aaramis laughs. 'Go to Captain Ryglot and he'll be able to fill you in with 
all the details.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Captain Ryglot Cupperhide'<BR>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'I am very [busy] at the moment. Perhaps you should come back at another time Crydee.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Why are you busy'<BR>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'I can't go into any great detail, but the Crystalline Globe was taken from our command structure. It's believed to have 
been separated into three pieces. Unfortunately, we're having a lot of trouble relocating it. Perhaps you'd like to [help].'</P>

<P>You say, 'I will help'<BR>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'That's good to hear Crydee. I wish we had more soldiers like yourself willing to help. I'm going to need you to locate the 
missing pieces of the globe and bring them back to me. After you've acquired the pieces perhaps you'd be able to rally enough people to lend us a hand 
with another [mission] objective we've been unable to fulfill do to our diminished numbers.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What mission?'<BR>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Well, I can't go into any details as to our main purpose is, but one of our missions was to exterminate the crystalline 
dragon. However, due to our company being split we are unable to go forward with this part of the operation. It has been placed on hold, pending the 
outcome of the [war].'</P>

<P>You say, 'What war?'<BR>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Unfortunately, that is one of the things that I'm unable to speak of at this time. However, if you are [willing] to help rally 
some people together I may be able to release some more information to you.'</P>

<P>You say, 'i am willing'<BR>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide says 'Well, that's good to hear. Bring me back what I've requested and we'll talk then.'</P>

<P>You now need to find three items all with the name "A piece of the crystalline globe" that drop off mobs in the zone. Once you have them all, you will 
need to give them to Captain Rygot Cupperhide.<BR>
Captain Ryglot Cupperhide looks up at you in surprise. 'I can't believe you brought the missing pieces back to me so quickly. I have a team of men who 
have been looking for these pieces for weeks now. That's quite a feat. Unfortunately, I will be unable to make use of the Crystalline Globe at this time. 
A message has been dispatched to my platoon asking us to return to the Halls of Honor. It looks as if we'll be joining up with the rest of our company fairly 
soon. Keep the globe. If you're able to rally enough people together to take on Aerin`Dar then perhaps you'll be able accomplish an objective that our 
platoon was unable to do. I must go now. Good luck to you Crydee.</P>

<P><B>Part 1 - Aerin`Dar, Plane of Valor</B></P>

<P>You will now need a raid in order to defeat Aerin`Dar. Once the dragon is out of the way, A Planar Projection will spawn at the middle of the room.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, A Planar Projection'<BR>
The Planar Projection's thoughts enter your own. 'You have done well. You will now be able to enter the Halls of Honor.'</P>

<P>You will not get a yellow flag message as you are only flagged to enter the Halls of Honor through the Plane of Valor at this point. You will need to 
drop down the passageway at the center of the room where the Planar Projection is, then follow it to the end to an area with white columns. Click on 
the lightning here to enter the Halls of Honor. The "You have received a character flag!" will now show up, and the flag you obtained will allow you to enter 
the Halls of Honor from the Plane of Tranquility.</P>

<P><B>Part 2 - Three Trials, Halls of Honor</B></P>

<P>Trydan Faye's Trial:<BR>
Hail him and he will say some stuff, then say "I am ready" which will spawn a custodian of marr. Killing this mob will cause Rydda`Dar to spawn and 
anything else in the room should depop. Once the dragon is defeated, hail Trydan Faye to get the "flag." The message you get will mention that "An 
ethereal mist descends from the air and surrounds your very being" but not specifically state that you got a flag.</P>

<P>Alekson Garn's Trial:<BR>
Hail him and he will say some stuff, then say "I am ready" which will spawn a custodian of marr. Killing this mob will cause the trial itself to start. You will 
need protect three women that you cannot target, each in a different room while fighting a bunch of hillbillies. Once all the hillbillies are dead, the trial will 
be completed provided that all women still live. After the trial, hail Alekson Garn to get the "flag." The message you get will mention that "An ethereal mist 
descends from the air and surrounds your very being" but not specifically state that you got a flag.</P>

<P>Rhaliq Trell's Trial:<BR>
Hail him and he will say some stuff, then say "I am ready" which will spawn a custodian of marr. Killing this mob will cause the trial itself to start. You will 
now need to protect a bunch of villagers from a bunch of evil knights. Once all knights are defeated, the trial will be completed provided that the villagers 
still live. You will now want to hail Rhaliq Trell to get the "flag." The message you get will mention that "An ethereal mist descends from the air and 
surrounds your very being" but not specifically state that you got a flag.</P>

<P>With all three trials completed, you will be able to enter the Temple of Marr [Honor B.] The above three trials may be completed in any order so do not 
worry about needing to do one before the other.</P>

<P><B>Part 3 - Lord Mithaniel Marr, Temple of Marr</B></P>

<P>At this point you will need a raid to fight Lord Mithaniel Marr. To get to him, you need to go through the Halls of Honor to get to the Temple of Marr 
[Honor B] as this zone cannot be accessed directly from the Plane of Tranquility. With Mithaniel Marr defeated, A Planar Projection will spawn.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, A Planar Projection'<BR>
The Planar Projection's thoughts enter your own. 'You have done well, now receive the knowledge that Mithaniel Marr once held!' You look down at your 
arms to see a set of unintelligible runes being burnt into your arms. The pain is terrible and searing. Suddenly the sensation is gone and the runes slowly 
fade. Also among your possessions you find a small tattered book as old as the ages. You recognize it as something that Maelin might be able to 
translate.<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Chapter 5: The Mistress of Torment &amp; Pain</B></P>

<P>This chapter concerns the Plane of Torment and gaining entry to Saryrn's lair where you will fight her. The flag you get from defeating Saryrn is needed 
to fight Rallos Zek and enter the Tower of Solusek Ro. You will need to have completed Chapters 2 and 3 in order to complete this chapter.</P>

<P><B>Part 1 - Fahlia Shadyglade, Plane of Tranquility</B></P>

<P>While there is some dialgue before this, it is not critical. Fahlia Shadyglade can be found in the sick house in Plane of Tranquility, sitting next to a wood 
elf. The flag you get from her, allows you to do the raid event in Plane of Torment so that you can get the flag from Saryrn afterwards.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Fahlia Shadyglade'<BR>
*dialogue missing*</P>

<P>You say, 'what condition'<BR>
*dialogue missing*</P>

You say, 'what plane of torment'<BR>
*dialogue missing*</P>

<P>You say, 'I will go'<BR>
Fahlia Shadyglade tells you, 'Wonderful. I did not think that an outsider was one that I could trust to aid me in this. One name that Tylis has mentioned 
in agony is that of Maareq. I do not know whom this is, but he must be instrumental in Tylis' suffering. You must find Maareq and do what you must to 
release Tylis from this torture.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P>Please note that if you do not get this flag, you have not completed Chapter 3 and received Bertoxxulous' flag.</P>

<P><B>Side-Quest: A Screaming Sphere</B></P>

<P>This side quest needs to only be done by one person but will take a rade to complete the ring event. The result is a key that allows you to open the 
door to where Saryrn is. To start it, you will need to attack Baraguj Szuul, which will teleport you to his stomach where there actual event is. You will 
need to kill the following mobs to get several orbs:<BR>
The Avatar of Agony: Orb of Agony<BR>
The Avatar of Anguish: Orb of Anguish<BR>
The Avatar of Pain: Orb of Pain<BR>
The Avatar of Suffering: Orb of Suffering</P>

<P>With everything else out of the way, you then fight the Unimaginable Horror to get teleported back out to where Baraguj Szuul is. Killing him now will 
result in you obtaining "Mouths of Baraguj Szuul" which is a container that you combine the four orbs in to get A Screaming Sphere, which is the actual 
key to Saryrn's lair.</P>

<P><B>Part 2 - Tylis Newleaf, Plane of Torment</B></P>

<P>It is necessary to fight your way up the tower to where Maareq the Prophet is. In order to get here, you will go through a series of levels, each of 
which has a mini-boss that drops a key to get to the next level. Once you defeat Maareq the Prophet, you will be able to talk Tylis Newleaf.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Tylis Newleaf'<BR>
Tylis Newleaf doesn't move, but struggles to whisper, '...help ...end this torment ...will you come? I can show you the pain... it moves in the shadows of 
my mind... will you assist me?'</P>

<P>You say, 'i will assist you'<BR>
Tylis Newleaf says 'Please tell me when you are ready. I do not know if I have enough energy to channel all of you, but I can try. When you are ready, I 
will channel you into my pain.'</P>

<P>You say, 'we are ready'<BR>
This will transport your group to another area which has monsters. Each group leader will need to say "we are ready" to get transported over. Defeating 
The Keeper of Sorrows at the end will cause Tylis Newleaf to spawn.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Tylis Newleaf'<BR>
Tylis Newleaf tells you, 'I must thank you for your kind efforts friends. This place has laid claim to me for far too long. Please take care and offer the dark 
wench my best. I am off... and I suggest you not stray to far from that route yourselves. Please tell me when you are ready to return and may your blades 
strike true!'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P>This flag will allow you to gain the flag from Saryrn.</P>

<P><B>Part 3 - Saryrn, Plane of Torment</B></P>

<P>You will now need another raid event to fight Saryrn herself. When she is defeated, a planar projection will show up.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, A Planar Projection<BR>
The Planar Projection's thoughts enter your own. 'You have done well, now receive the knowledge that Saryrn once held!' You look down at your arms to 
see a set of unintelligible runes being burnt into your arms. The pain is terrible and searing. Suddenly the sensation is gone and the runes slowly fade.<BR>

<P><B>Chapter 6: The Rain Keeper</B></P>

<P>This chapter concerns the Plane of Storms and gaining access to the Bastion of Thunder. It also covers gaining access to the towers and meeting 
Karana. The flag you get from Karana is needed to gain access to the planes of water, air and earth.</P>

<P><B>Part 1 - Askr the Lost, Plane of Storms</B></P>

<P>For this part, it is generally easier to collect all the items you need first then go talk to Askr the Lost afterwards. The medallions need to be from two 
different giant tribes [desert, forest or ocean] and any combination will work. These drop only off the named giants. The head can come from any giant 
tribe and is a common drop for all of them. The beard, bone and sash each come from one of the tribes. Once you have all of these, you are ready to 
speak to Askr the Lost:<BR>
- Storm Giant Head<BR>
- Storm Satuur Sash<BR>
- Storm Taarid Bone<BR>
- Storm Volaas Beard<BR>
- 2 Esoteric Medallions</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Askr the Lost'<BR>
Askr looks up at you and when he does, you take note of the scraggly beard on his weather-worn face; the scent of ale permeates your senses and 
pushes you to look away slightly. In an apparent drunken stupor, Askr begins to speak with surprising clarity. 'Here to wash the windows and clean the 
flooring, are you? No? Well, you can't be much help then. And the likes of you obviously wouldn't be able to get rid of the massive problem we're having. 
Bah, says I. You can help me no more than any of these other vagrants. Leave me alone to my ale and my misery.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what problem?'<BR>
Askr points drunkenly towards the exit of the cave. 'Have you not seen the foul denizens of destruction outside? Hrmph! Going everywhere they please, 
pillaging, plundering. . . I'm lucky to have survived this long. Bah, it doesn't matter, there's nothing that anyone can do to stop them, and that is why I'm 
still stuck here with my *hic* potions.'</P>

<P>*Give Askr the Lost a Storm Giant Head.*<BR>
The drunken stupor that Askr had been in earlier appears to vanish in an instant; a glimmer of hope now flashes in the depths of his eyes. 'This is the head 
of a giant. . . a storm giant from outside the caves.' Askr ponders what this revelation could mean. He mutters to himself, 'If it is possible that someone has 
indeed bested a giant here in the planes, then perhaps it is possible. . .' He looks back at you very sternly and asks, 'Tell me now and be truthful, was it 
you who severed the head of this giant from his body?'</P>

<P>You say, 'It was me'<BR>
Askr the Lost says 'Truly, I am amazed that someone of your caliber was able to do what I could not. I have been stuck in these desolate caves for so 
long, I had almost lost hope that I would ever find a way to get rid of those accursed giants. But you. . .  you have been able to best at least one of 
them. It is reasonable to suggest that if you are able to dispatch one, you may be able to dispatch others. I need to know for sure if you are as capable 
an individual as it appears you are. This is very important, so are you paying attention?'</P>

<P>You say, 'yes'<BR>
Askr the Lost says 'This place was once beautiful and serene, with the great Karana's showers falling day and night soothing the lands and the creatures 
that inhabit it. Alas, there was an invasion of a superior force -- the storm giants which you have encountered. They laid waste to the lands, burned down 
trees, and have caused so much havoc I don't even know what is to become of it. Originally, they came as one group and crossed the breadth of the land 
pillaging and plundering all that they could find. Over time, though, they grew apart and distinct factions grew around Mount Grenidor.' [continue]</P>

<P>You say, 'continue'<BR>
Askr the Lost says 'To the south of Grenidor lay Srerendi, Shores of the Lost and the Srerendi storm giants. Born of the ocean and the cool air, they lay 
claim to the shores and the plains inland as their own. To the west of Grenidor lay Krendic, Sands of Chaos and the Krendic storm giants. They have skin 
that is thick as dirt and blend in well with their surroundings. To the north of the great mount lay Kelek`Vor, the Forest of Tears and the Kelek`Vor storm 
giants. They are born of the wood and take great pleasure in seeing it used to their own purposes.' [continue]<BR>

<P>You say, 'continue'<BR>
Askr the Lost says 'I must know if you are truly capable of defeating the storm giants that abound here. To do this, you must slay one of each of the 
three factions and return to me something specific to each tribe: from the Srerendi storm giants, return their shorn beard; from the Krendic storm giants, 
a piece of their rocky carcass; from the Kelek`Vor storm giants, the crest from their warrior garments. These three items will ensure that you indeed do 
have the ability to defeat the foul denizens that have seized control of these lands. And if you do indeed have the ability, there may be more in store for 
you very shortly.'</P>

<P>You should have been given a container somewhere during the dialogue. You'll want to place the Storm Volaas Beard, a Storm Taarid Bone and a Storm 
Satuur Sash in it then press the combine button. Give the combined container to Askr the Lost.<BR>
Askr looks over the remnants of the storm giants in his hands then looks up at you with a glimmer of hope in his eyes. 'Then it's true! You have the means 
to push back the scourge of giants. . . you must go forth to the Bastion of Thunder and finish there what you have started here. It is imperative that you 
clear the forces of giants from the Bastion so that order can be restored to the thunderous reaches beyond.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P>You say, 'What Bastion of Thunder?'<BR>
Askr the Lost says 'To be honest, I cannot say that it is entirely possible, what with the ferocity of the giants and their reluctance to leave the lands they 
now inhabit. From what I do know, each of the Leaders of each tribe has one piece to allow entrance into the Bastion of Thunder. When two of these 
pieces are combined, they form an esoteric medallion that allows instant passage to the thunderous plains beyond. If you can return two of these pieces 
to me, I will be able to forge them into the medallion that will help you on your journey.'<BR>
*Askr' the lost gives you Askr's Bag of Verity.*</P>

<P>You should have another container, which you will now place the two Esoteric Medallions in then combine. Give this combined container to Askr the 
Lost.<BR>
The mystical medallion given to you by Askr settles around your neck and then disappears into nothingness. There is no call for alarm, for the medallion is 
now a part of your soul.<BR>
Askr the Lost says 'You have retrieved the pieces! You are well on your way to pushing forth on your quest to return balance to the plains of thunder. 
The most difficult part lies before you. . . deep in the heart of Mount Grenidor, there is a tempest that rages on eternally. It is there that you must 
present your medallion to the skies above to be transported to the citadel of thunderous might. Take the medallion and go forth, then deliver these 
storm giants to their creator!'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P>Go into the cave with the tornado in the middle and click on the portal.<BR>
An aura of soft light gleams around you as the shrine reacts to your Talisman of Thunderous Foyer and sends you forth into the mighty Bastion of 
Thunder.<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P>You will now be able to enter the Bastion of Thunder through the Plane of Tranquility.</P>

<P><B>Side-Quest: Keys for the Four Towers and Karana's Tower</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Askr the Lost'<BR>
Askr the Lost looks down at the fallen corpses at his feet and begins to mumble quietly, 'Karana help me, I had no idea. I am sorry Rainkeeper, I have 
truly failed you. I must find a way to rouse him from his [slumber].'</P>

<P>You say, 'What slumber?'<BR>
Askr the Lost says 'The Rainkeeper lies in deep meditation at the top of the great tower, Torden. His meditations have some how become tainted by a 
force from outside the plane. He lies in his tower besieged by all manner of dark visions and dreamscapes. I cannot fathom the focus it must take to discern 
the clairvoyance that the Rainkeeper controls. It is surely his fitful sleep that has caused this turmoil to reign here. You must [gain entrance] to Torden, 
Crydee.'</P>

<P>You say, 'How do I gain entrance?'<BR>
Askr the Lost says 'An ethereal seal that is protected by the collective power of the lightning, blizzards, tornadoes, and sandstorms guards the tower. 
You must collect the essence of these storms in order to create the key that will allow you to enter the tower of Torden. But first you must earn the right 
to enter the [courtyard] of the Bastion. From there you will be able to find the storm essences.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What courtyard?'<BR>
Askr the Lost says 'The courtyard will allow you access to the four greater towers as well as Torden itself. The strongest giants of the lower halls most 
likely hold the key that you will need to enter the courtyard. Be wary of the giants in this stronghold Crydee, they each hold a piece of the great power 
of the Rainkeeper, unbridled by his control and wisdom.'</P>

<P>At this point there are two keys that need to be made. The first is the key for the Four Towers, which should be done by several people to make 
bringing groups up to the upper towers easier. For this key, you will need to collect the following items, all of which drop from mobs in the lower towers:<BR>
- Blizard Gem<BR>
- Lightning Gem<BR>
- Sandstorm Gem<BR>
- Tornado Gem<BR>
- Ring of Torden</P>

<P>The gems drop off random mobs for the appropriate wing, while the Ring of Torden only drops off any of the bosses. Once you have them all, place 
the gems in the Ring of Torden [which is a container] and press the combine button to create the Enchanted Ring of Torden. This item is a key for the 
upper towers and will transport an entire group there.</P>

<P>Once this is done, you can now start working on the key for Karana's Tower [also referred to as Agnarr's Tower.] You will now need to collect several 
items. While the spheres will drop rarely from krigers in the appropriate wing of the first level, they are more common in the upper tower area. The 
Unadorned Symbol of Torden will only drop from named mobs in either the Upper Towers or Karana's Tower:<BR>
- Blizzard Sphere<BR>
- Lightning Sphere<BR>
- Sandstorm Sphere<BR>
- Tornado Sphere<BR>
- Unadorned Symbol of Torden</P>

<P>Like with the other key, the Unadorned Symbol of Torden is actually a container. Place the four spheres in it and combine it to get the key to Karana's 
Tower. Once at least one person has this, it will be possible to continue on to the next part.</P>

<P><B>Part 2 - Agnarr and Karana, Bastion of Thunder</B></P>

<P>This is a raid encounter event involving multiple mobs. The first boss in this is Evynd Firestorm. When he is defeated say "transport" [without quotes] 
to Askr the Lost to be sent to the next level of the tower.</P>

<P>The next level is controlled by Emmerik Skyfury. Like before, your raid will need to defeat this giant in order to continue. You'll need to have a bit of 
caution at this point. Only one person should talk to Askr the Lost and say "what storm" to him, which will spawn A Chaotic Vortex. When your raid is 
ready, everyone will need to right-click on A Chaotic Vortex to be transported to the final area.</P>

<P>At this point, you will fight Agnarr the Storm Lord, who is the other half of Karana's personality. Once he is defeated, you can then talk to Karana 
himself.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Karana'<BR>
Karana looks down at Crydee's face. He seems so insignificant next to the massive stature of the Rainkeeper. 'Don't worry mortal, Askr is unharmed, I 
have set him on a journey that will take him to all corners of this reality. He will either find the balance of the Fallen or he will die trying. And what of 
you champions? Do you wish to follow the path of the Fallen? A more dangerous path has never existed. Defy the will of the Pantheon at your peril.</P>

<P>You say, 'I wish to follow the path of the fallen'<BR>
Karana begins to laugh quietly. You seem to notice a great storm cloud brewing once more above him. A sudden arching bolt hits you, but you are 
unharmed. Instead a tome written in the language of the gods appears in your hands. 'Then let what I know be yours to know as well. Your path leads 
you onward Crydee. The path to power or ruin, the choice is up to you. Speak the words and I will send you on your way.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P>You say, 'I choose the path of power'<BR>
Karana begins to cast the gate spell.<BR>
Karana nods and begins to utter the same unfamiliar words that sent Askr into the void. The storm above him rises up and begins to spark sending chills 
up your spine. The Rainkeeper's voice rises to an incredible wail as the storm rages through the room. The cold rain pelting your face is the last thing 
you remember as a great bolt of pure storm energy envelopes you.</P>

<P>This last part will teleport you back to the entry room for the Bastion of Thunder.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Chapter 7: The Warlord</B></P>

<P>This chapter concerns the Plane of Innovation and gaining access to the Plane of Tactics. It also covers Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek and Rallos Zek. The 
flags you get form Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek are needed to fight Rallos Zek and gain entry to the Tower of Solusek Ro. Rallos Zek's flag is needed to gain 
entry to Solusek Ro's lair in the tower and enter the elemental planes.</P>

<P><B>Part 1 - Grand Librarian Maelin, Plane of Knowledge</B><BR>

<P>This part needs to be done after you have gained flags from Saryrn, Karana and Mithaniel Marr. Technically you are supposed to say "what lore?" to 
him after all three of these and he will say different things based on what information you have. Below is what occurs when all three have been completed 
though having Karana completed is not necessary for Rallos Zek.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Grand Librarian Maelin'<BR>
Maelin tells you, 'Welcome back my friends. I assure you that I have been studying the Cipher of Druzzil very diligently. Did you happen to find any lore or 
information that I could look at?'</P>

<P>You say, 'what lore?'<BR>
Maelin tells you, 'This is quite interesting friends. It is a detailed document on what has become of Zebuxoruk. It seems that he had been tampering with 
translating works of the gods for mortals. This knowledge was leading them to enlightenment and finally to ascention into dietyhood. This angered the 
gods, for they felt that any diety should be chosen by them. Ascension of any mortal was not something they were prepared to deal with.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Side-Quest: Nitram Anizok</B></P>

<P>This is a side quest that will flag you for being able to open the factory door in the Plane of Innovation.</P>

<P>Hail, Nitram Anizok<BR>
Nitram Anizok says 'Oh my hello! It has been such a long time since I have had visitors. Have you come to learn of [advanced tinkering] as well?'</P>

<P>You say, 'advanced tinkering'<BR>
Nitram Anizok says 'Aye, I advanced to this plane due to my work on tinkering back in Ak`Anon. A grand city it is, but my abilities were compromised with 
the materials I had to work with there. My body and soul has come to rest here, forever coming up with new ideas. You should be aware though that this 
plane is not how it was when I arrived. Much [construction] has taken place.'</P>

<P>You say, 'construction'<BR>
Nitram Anizok says 'When I first arrived I started creating smaller things. As time went on my inventions became more and more focused and impressive. 
I started building steam powered clockwork to help me gather materials. I had gone too far giving them the ability to learn and with a built in desire of 
self perpetuation. They began to integrate themselves with the clockwork that already existed within the factory that you can see if you step outside. 
I once worked within the factory with a kind and fair gnome, Meldrath. Now that he has gone missing the clockworks seem to be working towards a more 
devious goal. The clockwork out here in the junkyard have been discarded due to their malfunction or replacement by a more efficient series. Needless to 
say their [instinct for survival] has not been lost.'</P>

<P>You say, 'instinct for survival'<BR>
Nitram Anizok says 'The clockwork have become increasingly aggressive because of their desperation for spare parts. I have to defend myself anytime I 
head out to find parts for my tinkering. I fear for my safety with what is being built in the factory. I have started to build myself my own means of 
defense. It is nearly completed but I need an odd combination of batteries to start it up. I should have planned more carefully for it to use simple mana 
batteries.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what combination of batteries?'<BR>
Nitram Anizok says 'Well you see when I was back home it was common for me to use a mycological spore extricate-kinetoconvertor to power my devices. 
I started planning my defense to use this as a power source out of sheer habit. Here in this desolation the mushrooms that were grown back home do not 
exist. I am going to have to rig something from spare parts. It is taking a long time with my having to search the junkyard small portions at a time due to 
the clockworks. Would you help me in [collecting materials]?'</P>

<P>You say, 'collecting materials?'<BR>
Nitram Anizok peers over some schematics laying on a table next to him. 'Let us see here. I have some of the base parts for the power source. If you could 
collect a copper node, a bundle of super conductive wires, and an intact power cell I could power up the machine. Good luck to you Crydee, I hope that 
we can work together on this.'</P>

<P>At this point you will need to collect the items that he is looking for, and only one person needs to gather all the items. Once they have been obtained, 
giving them to Nitram Anizok will trigger a ring event raid. You'll first need to follow Nitram Anizok around and keep him alive. When he reaches Xanamech 
Nezmirthafen, the clockwork dragon will spawn. Kill Xanamech Nezmirthafen, then hail Nitram Anizok to get the factory flag.</P>

<P>This flag allows you to open the factory door for yourself and anyone else who does not have this paticular flag.</P>

<P><B>Part 2 - Giwin Mirakon, Plane of Innovation</B></P>

<P>Giwin Mirakon can be found in the factory of the Plane of Innovation.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Giwin Mirakon'<BR>
Giwin Mirakon tells you, 'How did you get in here? Hrmm no matter, you will be helping me now for I am a [great warrior] of Rallos Zek and I know you wish 
not to provoke my fury!'</P>

<P>You say, 'I am a great warrior'<BR>
Giwin Mirakon tells you, 'Yeah, you heard me! You know that I must be important if Rallos himself has plucked me from the battlefield to complete this 
[task]. Even though I serve my lord, I am desperate to return to my place on the eternal battlefield.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what task'<BR>
Giwin Mirakon tells you, 'Ya, you see Rallos sent me here to contract the machines to work on a mana powered piece of machinery that could test all on 
the eternal battlefield. This weapon of ultimate destruction is taking quite a long time to be completed. You know.. if you were to go [test the machine] 
and it were to fail against you I could be on my way back to tell Rallos that it was defeated by mere mortals. Help me to get back to the battlefield and 
out of this rusted out junkheap.'</P>

<P>You say, 'I will test the machine'<BR>
Giwin Mirakon tells you, 'Haha!  I knew I sensed the warring spirit within you. Go through over there. Ignore those steam powered soldiers and their talk 
of perimeters. Go into the main construction area, you will know you are there when you see power carriers taking energy to power up the machine. If you 
can stop the energy carriers from releasing their energy the machine will activate to see what has happened. I shall come to check on you and take a full 
report when you have destroyed it. Long live Rallos!'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Part 3 - Magnaetic Behemoth, Plane of Innovation</B></P>

<P>You will now need another raid event to defeat the Magnaetic Behemoth and Giwin Mirakon will spawn afterwards.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Giwin Mirakon'<BR>
Giwin Mirakon gives you a look of disbelief and then concern. 'You destroyed the machine?! You should come with me to the Plane of Tactics. Surely the 
Zeks will want to honor you in your warring spirit. I will go on ahead of you to prepare for your arrival. I believe that you can access the Plane through the 
portal that the weakli.. Er tranquil have opened in the Plane of Tranquility. I anticipate our next meeting on the Battlefields of Zek!'<BR>

<P><B>Part 4 - Tallon and Vallon Zek, Drunder, Fortress of Zek</B></P>

<P>This requires a raid even, Tallon and Vallon are two separate fights even though they are included together. You can fight them in either order.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, A Planar Projection'<BR>
You realize that the image is a projection of Maelin Starpyre's thoughts. His thoughts enter into your own. 'The pack of notes you now possess from

<P>You say, 'Hail, Grand Librarian Maelin'<BR>
Maelin tells you, 'Astounding, this truly is the Cipher of Druzzil! I shall take notes from your knowledge and try to learn from it. If you happen upon any 
artifacts that have writings in the language of the gods bring them back to me and I will do my best to read them to you in common tongue.'<BR>

<P>You say, 'what information?'<BR>

You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Part 6 - Rallos Zek, Drunder, Fortress of Zek</B></P>

<P>Rallos Zek is another raid event.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, A Planar Projection'<BR>

the Cipher of Druzzil.'<BR>

<P><B>Part 7 - Grand Librarian Maelin, Plane of Knowledge</B><BR>

<P>You say, 'what lore'<BR>
Maelin tells you, 'As I have told you, you must retrieve the elemental essence from each elemental plane so that we can activate the machine in the Plane 
of Innovation that will open a portal into the shard of time that Zebuxoruk is held.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what information'<BR>
Maelin tells you, 'There is no way to escape from the prison that is The Plane of Time. I am sorry but your quest for information ends here. Time is 
something that none of us can escape. That is however.. back when my explorations of the Planes were more common, I would travel searching for 
knowledge and lore to bring back to Tanaan. I stumbled into the Plane of Innovation. It was a great marvel to see indeed. I found the creator of all things 
mechanical. Meldrath the Marvelous was a kin</P>

<P>Maelin takes a deep breath and continues, 'I can see now that he was not joking at all. Let us suppose that you travelers could venture into the 
Elemental Planes and retrieve this essence; and form it into one powerful conglomeration. You could open a tear into the period of time before Zebuxoruk 
was imprisoned. There is no way you can free him from his stasis now, but if you were to halt the Pantheon at the time of imprisonment. Hah! It could work 
I do believe. Forgive me, but my old gn<BR>

<P><B>Chapter 8: The Burning Prince</B></P>

<P>This chapter concerns the Tower of Solusek Ro, gaining entry to Solusek Ro's lair as well as fighting him. The flag you get form Solusek 
Ro is needed to gain entry to the Plane of Fire.</P>

<P><B>Part 1 - Miak the Searedsoul, Plane of Tranquility</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Miak the Searedsoul'<BR>
Miak the Searedsoul says, 'Greetings traveler. I am Miak, guardian of the portal to the greater elemental [Plane of Fire.]'</P>

<P>You say, 'What Plane of Fire?'<BR>
Miak the Searedsoul says, 'The Plane of Fire is no place for a mortal to go frolicking about. Regardless, to use the portal now would surely mean [your 
demise.]'</P>

<P>You say, 'what demise?'<BR>
Miak the Searedsoul says, 'Yes, the end of your mortal existence. Recently the portal seems to have lost its direction. The location the portal sends you 
to is not safe; the [portal's destination] seems to have moved somehow.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what is the portal's destination?'<BR>
Miak the Searedsoul says, 'I do not know if I will ever be able to correct the portal's destination, but if you have the true route for the portal in your mind 
I will be able to channel the portal to the correct location.'<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Part 2 - The Guardians, Tower of Solusek Ro</B></P>

You are now ready to fight the five tower guardians in the Tower of Solusek Ro. Each will give you a flag and obtaining all of them, will alow entry to 
Solusek Ro's chambers provided that you also have the flag from Rallos Zek. For each of these encounters, you go up some stairs, then click on a torch to 
be transported to another area. In the new area, you fight your way to the boss, then click on another torch to leave. It is this second click which results 
in you obtaining the actual flag.</P>

<P>Xuzl:<BR>
As you place your hand on the burning cauldron, you feel arcane wisdom pulsing in your mind.<BR>

As you place your hand on the burning cauldron, you feel a bolt of energy surge through your arm.<BR>

<P>Jiva:<BR>
As you place your hand on the burning cauldron, you feel your body fill with strength.<BR>
You have received a character flag!</P>

<P><B>Lore - The Time Grows Near</B></P>

<P>It can also be noted that Rizlona carried a book on her person titled "The Time Grows Near." This section only reproduces the contents of this 
book.</P>

<P>Jiva the Reckless rests now that his work is done.</P>

<P>With the knowledge afforded to him by wise Arlyxir he was able to create a tear in the planes between the Tower of Solusek Ro and The Plane of 
Fire. Arlyxir has always been trusted go-between for Solusek and his father Fennin. However, Arlyxir has decided to form alliance with Solusek.</P>

<P>The decision of direct confrontation against the populace of Norrath was not an easy one to make. They both know that Fennin would not agree to 
such a hostile act, because the Pantheon would not condone it.</P>

<P>After many hours of incantations a great well marked with runes of flame appeared and began to pour the very essence of the Plane of Fire into 
The Tower. The Guardians of Dresolik, the Great Shard, watch over the pulsating crystal has it harnesses the power being syphoned from the Plane the 
Fire. Only time stands between us now. Those that I once walked with soon learn of the mistakes in their transgressions.</P>

<P>I can hear Xuzl in his Tower, always working on his conjurings. The crackle of the animated regiment of flaming swords can be deafening. Xuzl does 
not take any time to rest; for he knows as will all do that the time draws near.</P>

<P>Greater fiends has been constructed by Solusek to spread their curse upon any that survive the initial destructive force from Dresolik. The seven 
fiends will be generals of the army being conjured by Xuzl. Solusek has also placed his trust in two elemetals. These elementals have coalesced into the 
form of wyverns. I must say that I am quite partial to their new forms, and have formed a kinship with them. Together with them we will exterminate any 
dragonkind that are resistant enough to flame to save them from onslaught that Dresolik will provide. Dresolik pulses with extreme power, it will soon be 
powerful enough to scorch Norrath. I can only hope that my voice and praise of Solusek will be enough to give the others the strengh needed to 
continue.</P>

<P><B>Part 3 - Solusek Ro, Tower of Solusek Ro</B></P>

<P>You can now enter Solusek Ro's chambers, where you will be able to fight him. This is another raid event.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, A Planar Projection'<BR>
Miak the Searedsoul's thoughts enter into your own. 'That is it! The portal into the Plane of Fire lies within the Lava Well of Ro. You must now fall into this 
well to gain access into that plane. I will make adjustments to the Plane of Tranquility portal so that you can access that Element from here as well.'<BR>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Muzzrap Dirtdigger'<BR>
Muzzrap Dirtdigger says 'Hi there Crydee, what brings you to these parts? You wouldn't be attempting to enter the Plane of Earth I hope, it is quite 
dangerous in there. I have heard of mortals attempting to [seek council with the Rathe] and I would say this is a very bad idea.'</P>

<P>You say, 'I seek council with the rathe'<BR>
Muzzrap Dirtdigger says 'Are you crazy? Perhaps you didn't hear what I just said about how dangerous it is. Nevertheless, it is your choice and I cannot 
stop you. If you are going to attempt to gain access to the council and have already [obtained the necessary key] to their chamber I might be able to 
help. Many have told me that the force that seals the Rathe away is everchanging.'</P>

<P>You say, 'i have already obtained the necessary key'<BR>
Muzzrap Dirtdigger says 'I have already assisted you in obtaining new keys to the rathe chamber please leave me be.'</P>

<P>Something is given to Muzzrap Dirtdigger at this point, but I am missing the item name. You will receive 6 A Mystical Key Fragment.<BR>
Muzzrap Dirtdigger says 'Please be careful how you distribute these key fragments. Only the strongest should be allowed to gain access to the Rathe 
Council. For each key fragment that I receive I will give the person that brings me it the artifact that is necessary to gain access to the Rathe.'</P>

<P>Give A Mystical Key Fragment to Muzzrap Dirtdigger.<BR>
Muzzrap Dirtdigger says 'Muzzrap Dirtdigger tells you, 'Well, it seems you have been chosen to seek council with the Rathe. I wish you the best of luck, 

you will certainly need it.''</P>

<P>You will now want to give An Eroded Passkey to Muzzrap Dirtdigger, which will spawn A Planar Projection.<BR>
Muzzrap Dirtdigger says 'This fellow should be able to help you with the power that you seek, I wish you luck.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, A Planar Projection'<BR>
You have been granted access into the chamber of the twelve.<BR>
A Planar Projection says 'Your will must be strong Crydee. Seek council with the council of twelve if you so wish.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Loreseeker Maelin'<BR>
Loreseeker Maelin fidgets about with excitement, 'So here you are, this is quite impressive. I cannot wait to see the results of this impressive machine! I 
have coordinated with the clockworks here that have not gone mad. We have set the machine to tear a point of time open that should be equal to that 
based on the cipher and history that we have [researched].'</P>

<P>You say, 'what have you researched?'<BR>
Loreseeker Maelin says 'Based on the findings from the information that you brought back to me I have determined the exact time to open. I believe the 
machine will work. Please step up and activate the machine! Once you have formed a bond with the Plane of Time you will be able to access the Plane 
again through the Plane of Tranquility. They have built a portal there, but no one was able to become attuned to that plane, until you that is. Good 
luck!'</P>

<P><B>Lore - Phase One: The Five Trials</B></P>

<P>This part only contains the lore that appears when you complete Phase 1 of the trials in Time B.</P>

<P>Solusek Ro says, 'This is absurd, why are we wasting our time and energy on this!? Direct action is needed, now! Banishing Zebuxoruk will not stop 
the mortals from entering into our planes. Their greed for power will have them soon trampling through our realms!'</P>

<P>Rallos Zek says, 'On this I agree! We must take action and the time is now. I will not have these mortals achieving the powers that we hold.'</P>

<P>Xegony says, 'Please listen to reason, we are doing what we must. The mortals possess a direct tie to Zebuxoruk. If his stasis is finished their link 
will dwindle as well as their powers and knowledge.'</P>

<P>Rathe says, 'The knowledge that was given to them by Zebuxoruk will fade from their minds. We must do this now, for if they were able to translate 
the divine language all existence would unravel. The balance of power in the universe would be destroyed.'</P>

<P>Solusek Ro says, 'This is exactly the point that I am making! So you agree we must show them now that we are the power above them, and not to 
be questioned!'</P>

<P>Rallos Zek says, 'You must see what he refers to; we must turn to Norrath and show them our power. What they are trying to accomplish cannot be 
allowed to come to pass.'</P>

<P>Fennin Ro says, 'My son, please understand we must stop this advancement of mortals without halting their existence. The balance of power must 
be maintained.  Without the mortals the balance would fade.'</P>

<P>Solusek Ro says, 'So they have made your decision for you too father. You are all wrong, this will only bring them further into our realms seeking 
answers! We must take action now. Have at your foolish games, I will not allow them to obtain my power.'</P>

<P>You look up and see a meteor burning through the sky; Solusek returning to his tower to brood over the matters at hand.</P>

<P>Rallos lets out a sigh of frustration that vibrates the ground at your feet.</P>

<P>Rathe says, 'Rallos still your warring heart. This is what must be done. We must place him in a stasis from which he will not be released. Come share 
your power. We must commence now.'</P>

<P>Xegony says, 'Mithaniel, Karana please record what you see here. With your good nature I am sure that your records will be impartial to any side. We 
must record this for the ages and learn from our mistake of allowing Zebuxoruk to gain so much power that is easily passed on to mortals.'</P>

<P>With a sudden jolt the wall comes into crystal clear focus.<BR>
As the path before you opens up in a swirl of mystical energy, the faded image of an hourglass appears. You have one additional hour.</P>

<P><B>Lore - Phase Two: The Second Set of Trials</B></P>

<P>This part only contains the lore that appears when you complete Phase 2 of the trials in Time B.</P>

<P>A bright aura streaks through the sky. The power of it sends a surge through your body that makes your hair stand on end.<BR>
The Triumvirate of Water speaks as one voice. It says, 'Now step up to the chambers. Give a part of yourselves to the bind on Zebuxoruk. Through our 
power, the bonds on him will never be broken. He will be eternally placed in stasis.'</P>

<P>Saryrn says, 'What of our weakened state. I refuse to return to my realm without the power to rule over my minions.'</P>

<P>Terris Thule says, 'Yes, how can I spread my touch over my lands if I lack so much of myself?'</P>

<P>Cazic Thule says, 'Do not worry daughter, we shall stay here until we are able to recover our strength.'</P>

<P>Rallos Zek says, 'Our armies shall serve us as we regenerate our abilities. We have nothing to fear.'</P>

<P>Bertoxxulous says, 'My soldiers of pestilence shall watch over us. Let us return to our chambers now.'</P>

<P>Innoruuk says, 'Are you enjoying watching this Hammer of the Tribunal? I hope your petty report will show my disdain for the Tribunal having no hand 
in this.'</P>

<P>The Seventh Hammer says, 'Do not waste your energy Innoruuk. You know they are eternally preoccupied with their trials. Surely even you understand 
many of these trials exist because of the hate you instill into the population of Norrath.'</P>

<P>Innoruuk says, 'Do not mock me! I shall seek you out after this is done and my power is restored. You will not be so smug after our next meeting.'</P>

<P>With a sudden jolt the wall comes into crystal clear focus.<BR>As the path before you opens up in a swirl of mystical energy, the faded image of an 
hourglass appears. You have three additional hours.</P>

<P><B>Lore - Phase Three: The Armies of the Gods</B></P>

<P>This part only contains the lore that appears when you complete Phase 3 in Time B.</P>

<P>Terris Thule says, 'I am certain my warriors will have no problem holding back any intruders, but I have my doubts about the other armies.'</P>

<P>Vallon Zek says, 'Surely you jest. Your armies better than the regiments from our realm?'</P>

<P>Tallon Zek says, 'There is no question that our warriors of War and Tactics will be the backbone of the army.'</P>

<P>Saryrn says, 'It is no matter anyways, no mortal could ever ascend to this place. These precautions are unnecessary. Bringing them here was a waste 
of time.'</P>

<P>Energy swirls rapidly through the portal causing it to glow brightly with power.</P>

<P><B>Lore - Phase Four: The Lesser Gods</B></P>

<P>This part only contains the lore that appears when you defeat all the lesser gods in Time B.</P>

<P>Rallos Zek says, 'Something is wrong.  I feel Tallon and Vallon's spirits have weakened.'</P>

<P>Innoruuk says, 'Don't be a fool, that is just from giving a part of themselves to the bond on Zebuxoruk.'</P>

<P>Cazic Thule says, 'No. It is more than that, I can feel the force of Terris has been drained as well.'</P>

<P>Bertoxxulous says, 'This is not possible, could mortals have reached us here? Call in our armies, we are too weak to fight now.'</P>

<P>Innoruuk says, 'You are all incompetent! I knew you all could not be trusted. If we are defeated in our weakened state, I do not know 
if we will be able to coalesce again. I will never forgive you all for what has transpired today!'</P>

<P>Rallos Zek says, 'Now is not the time to bicker! We must focus our strength on these puny mortals! Minions of the army, come to our sides. Your gods 
beckon you, we need you now!'</P>

<P>The sundial across the room begins to glow with an ethereal energy.</P>

<P><B>Lore - Phase Five: The Lesser Gods</B></P>

<P>This part only contains the lore that appears when you defeat all the greater gods in Time B.</P>

<P>Fennin Ro says, 'Impossible! How could the races of Norrath have traveled this deep into the Planes?!'</P>

<P>Xegony says, 'I regret that it has come to this. They leave us with little choice, however. We must fuse our powers together. Separately we are 
weakened, together we will halt their advances.'</P>

<P>Triumvirate of Water says, 'Unfortunate as it may be, I agree. We must call upon the beast we swore would never be needed.'</P>

<P>The Rathe says, 'Then let us begin. Let our abilities and powers meld into one. It shall be our final protector and savior. The only thing standing 
between us and non-existence'</P>

<P>Your head pounds from the amount of raw energy that begins to coalesce throughout the plane. Bright flashes of red, blue, green and brown begin 
to come into focus on one single point. A large towering beast begins to manifest itself. A horrible creation with all the powers from each elemental realm. 
Your body begins to shudder by the mere presence of this being.</P>

<P>The sundial across the room begins to glow with an ethereal energy.</P>

<P><B>Lore Phase Six: The Dragon</B></P>

<P>This part only contains the lore that appears when you defeat Quarm then destroy Zebuxoruk's prison in Time B.</P>

<P>Zebuxoruk staggers about and looks at you drowsy, from his weakened state. 'My thanks to you. I am surprised to see you have made it here. We 
must get back to Norrath. The time has come for me to share my knowledge. Something is coming, a threat to us all, and the sands in the hourglass are 
thinning. Make haste and take me back the way you came.'</P>

<P>Zebuxoruk says, 'I am surprised at the gods for taking such drastic measures, though I suppose all of the creations of the Nameless are capable of 
displaying poor judgment and irrational behavior. These gods are burdened with powers and responsibilities beyond our comprehension, yet at times even 
they do not understand the eventual effect of their actions. I am compelled to share the knowledge of the gods with the populace of Norrath, so that I 
might save their creations. They do not realize that if mortality ceases to exist... if they are not worshipped and held aloft by the beliefs of those that 
they now have grown to fear... they will fall from power and a new age of darkness will wash over existence as they know it. I did not seek to interfere 
with them or their realms, only to free them from a fate that awaits all of us. It is this fate that now stands ready, greedily gathered on the edge of the 
void, ready to test the will of all mortals.'</P>

<P>Zebuxoruk says, 'If they have taken measures these extreme I must rethink what I have done, and what I will do. If there was this much cause for 
conc...'<BR>
Suddenly in a bright flash a feminine figure appears before you. Your ears ring from the loud burst as she slowly materializes.</P>

<P>Druzzil Ro speaks with no movement of her mouth. Her thoughts flow through you, calming you as you begin to comprehend what she is trying to 
communicate to you.<BR>
Druzzil Ro speaks to your mind, 'Zebuxoruk, my student I cannot allow this to happen. If you were to escape from another prison the will and power of the 
gods will have been compromised.'</P>

<P>Zebuxoruk says, 'Druzzil, I have missed you. Wasn't it you that taught me in your own realm to seek knowledge and share it in all forms?'</P>

<P>Druzzil Ro speaks to your mind, 'That I did, but I also taught you not to share your wealth of knowledge if it would affect the fate of others. I cannot 
allow this to happen. I must set things back to how they were before you and these mortals arrived here, I believe that you cannot understand this and I 
am sorry.'</P>

<P>Druzzil Ro looks upon Zebuxoruk one last time, as a wave of sadness comes across her gentle face.</P>

<P>Druzzil Ro begins to chant an incantation; mana flows out from her body in all directions. Things begin moving slowly in reverse. You become dizzy from 
the experience and fall to your knees. As you look up the last thing you can see is Druzzil Ro smiling in your direction. She then waves her arms gracefully 
and points at you.</P>

<P>There is a brilliant flash and you find yourself displaced through time and space. For a moment you lose touch with yourself. As you wake, you find 
yourself back in the Plane of Knowledge, moments after talking to Maelin with the information of retrieving the Quintessence of Elements. Druzzil has 
preserved the timeline, and restored existence back to its normalcy.<BR>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<BR>
You have entered The Plane of Knowledge.</P>
