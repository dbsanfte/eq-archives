<P>April 4, 2003: All Galleries Online... Technically<BR>
The improved Luclin gallery is online. Many placeholder images still remain, which I plan to replace over the weekend. I still have a lot of 
new screen shots to add. I also plan to upgrade the gallery in my profile area to the new style. Non-gallery updates will be worked on soon, 
after all the placeholder images are replaced and I am all caught up.</P>

<P>April 2, 2003: Odus and Velious Galleries Online<BR>
I added the Odus gallery a few days ago and the Velious gallery today. As before, placeholder images are being used with the Velious 
gallery until I have time to run around and get proper screen shots for the different zones. I also have a lot more new screen shots to 
processes afterwards then will begin work on some projects that don't relate to the galleries. I moved the link to get the Acrobat Reader, 
if you don't have it, to the bottom of this page. I found that it was causing problems accessing the contact area when an internet 
connection decided to run slow. Lots to do and more on the way!</P>

<P>March 30, 2003: Luclin and Odus Galleries<BR>
The Luclin and Odus galleries will be online soon. I have most of the menu screen shots done, which has been the main hold up. I'll be 
using a placeholder graphic for sections that I am still missing.</P>

<P>March 21, 2003: Faydwer Gallery Complete<BR>
Links to the images I misplaced were removed, and the gallery is fully functional now. I plan to start work on the Luclin Gallery next. No 
ETA yet as to when I expect it to be done.</P>

<P>March 20, 2003: Faydwer Gallery Online!<BR>
Ok, only part of it is up. I found a few link errors that I didn't have time to fix... so I misplaced a few images. I did an evaluation of all 
offsite links, so that area has been updated as well. Tomorrow, I expect to have the rest of the Faydwer Gallery live, then will start work 
on a different region.</P>

<P>March 19, 2003: Faydwer Gallery Update!<BR>
The update for the Faydwer Gallery is done and undergoing some final link testing. I expect to have this live tomorrow evening.</P>

<P>Some documents on this site are in Adobe Acrobat 5.0 format.<BR>
