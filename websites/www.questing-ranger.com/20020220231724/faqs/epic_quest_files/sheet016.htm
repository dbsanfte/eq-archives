<P><B>Possible Faction Issues</B></P>

<P>These are listed in the order in which you may run into a faction issue.</P>

<P><B>Plane of Growth</B><BR>
Although the Plane of Growth is not used for the quest, it does need special mentioning. Hunting here, will ruin faction with Faydark's 
Champions and Soldiers of Tunare.</P>

<P><B>Telin Darkforest [Faydark's Champion]</B><BR>
Telin Darkforest is on Faydark's Champion faction. Any of the Kelethin Ranger quests will give you faction with him. You can also kill orcs in 
Crushbone. Giving Small Lanterns to Jyle Windshot in West Freeport will give you faction with both Telin Darkforest and with Faelin 
Bloodbriar.</P>

<P><B>Faelin Bloodbriar and Foloal Stormforest [Soldiers of Tunare]</B><BR>
The best way to obtain faction with Faelin Bloodbriar is to give Small Lanterns to Jyle Windshot in West Freeport as will also give you faction 
with both Telin Darkforest.</P>

<P><B>Giz X`Tin [unknown]</B><BR>
He is mostly be on one of the Dark Elf Factions and will probably be less than indifferent to you. If this is the case, cast Spirit of Wolf on 
yourself [to be able to keep up with him]  than sneak up behind him so that he will be indifferent to you and then give him the ring. If you 
give him the ring, while he /CONs dubious [or lower] to you, you will not get the coin to continue the quest.</P>

<P><B>Dark Elf Corruptor and Dark Reavers in East Karana [Dark Elf Warrior]</B><BR>
Killing them will not impact faction with the Neriak Guards. This faction will only be noteworthy to any Dark Elves [and to a lesser extent Trolls 
and Ogres] that may wish to assist you with killing these.</P>

<P><B>Alrik Farsight [Keepers of the Art]</B><BR>
To gain faction with Alrik Farsight, visit the Magician Guild in Felwithe [B] and give Niola Impholder Bat Wings until she is amiable to you. If your 
faction with Niola Impholder is so low that she doesn't give you faction when you turn them in, stand behind her and use sneak to make her 
indifferent to you.</P>

<P><B>Kinlo Strongarm &amp; Usbak the Old [unknown]</B><BR>
If your faction with these dwarves is less than indifferent, you will need to stand behind them and use sneak in order to be able to deal with 
them.</P>

<P><B>Xanuusus [Stormreapers]</B><BR>
If your faction with Xanuusus is bad, try hunting in Runnyeye. There are a few mobs in the lowest level that give Stormreaper faction.</P>
