<P><B>Ivy Etched Armor FAQ</B><BR>
by Crydee Ossiriand, Torvonnilous Server<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.questing-ranger.com">http://www.questing-ranger.com</A><BR>
Version: 2004.06.01</P>

<P>These quests are given out by Gandari and Leaf Falldim at the Ranger Guild in Kithicor Forest. I do not have any faction information here as there is no 
reason for a ranger to have bad faction with either of them unless that ranger has been killing stuff that he should not have been.</P>

<P>Gandari can be found inside one of the buildings. Her quests tend to be easier and a lot less time consuming. Gandari will give you the quests for the: 
Ivy Etched Bracer, Ivy Etched Helm, Ivy Etched Sleeves and Ivy Etched Tunic. Leaf Falldim will be found outside near the central area. His quests tend to 
either be very time consuming in comparisons to Gandari's. Leaf Fallim will give you the quests for the: Ivy Etched Boots, Ivy Etched Gauntlets and Ivy 
Etched Leggings. These quests can be done in any order, but I am presenting them to you in order from head down to feet.</P>

<P>It should be noted that several quests call for different section of the Rune of Ivy. Unfortunately, they all will look the same. If you mix them up, you will 
need a caster to help you by using the "Identify" spell or use an item, such as the Star of Eyes, to identify them yourself.</P>

<HR>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('ivy_etched_helm-old')"><B>Ivy Etched Helm</B></A></P>

<P>This quest is given by Gandari in the Kithikor Woods Ranger Guild. The key phrase to trigger the quest is 'I am interested in Helm.'</P>

<P>Turn in items for this quest:<BR>
- Cyclops Charm<BR>
- Rune of Ivy [Top]<BR>
- Sapphire</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('cyclops_charm-old')">Cyclops Charm</A><BR>
The Cyclops Charm drops off Tarskuk in Rathetear Mountains. As far as I can tell, he drops it every time or very close to that. I have never seen him not 
drop it, though I have heard it is possible, He spawns near the bandit camp on the hill in the area closest to the zone to Lake Rathe. I am not sure as to 
exactly what his placeholder is, so kill every lizardman, cyclops and bandit in this area to get him to show up.</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('rune_of_ivy-top-old')">Rune of Ivy [Top]</A><BR>
The Rune of Ivy [Top] is a random drop off the Deathly Ushers in Mistmoore Castle. These mobs are female Dark Elf Warriors in plate armor. I have seen them 
all over inside the Castle itself, but they are most commonly found in the jail and sometimes in the servants area. If you are of appropriate level to wear this 
armor, I recommend going with the jail. To get to the jail, go to the back right corner of the cemetery and there is a secret passage way where you are able 
to just walk through the wall. Once you get inside the jail, the cells themselves can be opened by clicking on the false door. Keep in mind that some caster 
mobs and vampires will spawn in this are so resistance gear is highly recommended if you have it. The casters will nuke you down quick if you don't kill them 
fast. The vampires see through invisibility and will suck your stamina away. There are two secret passage ways in this area. One leads down into a basement 
where mobs do not spawn. This is probably the safest place to go if your group needs to go into heavy downtime for meding.</P>

<P>Sapphire<BR>
This can be purchased at many jewelry supply vendors.</P>

<HR>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('ivy_etched_bracer-old')"><B>Ivy Etched Bracer</B></A></P>

<P>This quest is given by Gandari in the Kithikor Woods Ranger Guild. The key phrase to trigger the quest is 'I am interested in Bracers.'</P>

<P>Turn in items for this quest:<BR>
- Fire Emerald<BR>
- Rune of Ivy [Bottom]<BR>
- Water Ring</P>

<P>Fire Emerald<BR>
This can be purchased at jewelry suppry vendors.</P>

<A href="javascript:popupInventory('rune_of_ivy-bottom-old')">Rune of Ivy [Bottom]</A><BR>
The Rune of Ivy [Bottom] is a random drop off Redwind, who is a shadow knight orc in Everfrost. He does have a pet with him. There are two ways to do 
this. You can use Harmony to pull the orcs around him and pick them off one by one then kill Redwind or you can use Harmony to single pull just Redwind. It 
really gets down to how much orc slaying you wish to do.</P>

<A href="javascript:popupInventory('water_ring-old')">Water Ring</A><BR>
The Water Ring is a random drop off the Aqua Goblin Tidal Lord in Dagnor's Cauldron. The mob is easy to kill, but I found that the ring does not drop more 
often than it does. This mob will spawn at the goblin camps in the zone and wanders about. The easiest way to get this is to clear out the goblin camp that 
is not far from Unrest the check tracking to see if any are up. When you cannot find any Aqua Goblin Tidal Lords on tracking, just hang out at the camp until 
one spawns. Be sure to check back at the camp periodically to clear out any undesirable goblin spawns before they start to wander about the zone.</P>

<HR>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('ivy_etched_sleeves-old')"><B>Ivy Etched Sleeves</B></A></P>

<P>This quest is given by Gandari in the Kithikor Woods Ranger Guild. The key phrase to trigger the quest is 'I am interested in Sleeves.'</P>

<P>Turn in items for this quest:<BR>
- Heart of Fire<BR>
- Rune of Ivy [Left]<BR>
- 2 Star Rubies</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('heart_of_fire-old')">Heart of Fire</A><BR>
The Heart of Fire drops off of Inferno Goblin Wizards in Solusek's Eye [aka Sol A] They look deceptively easy. The first time I attempted this it was me and a 
L50 Necromancer [who was an ex-ranger] hanging out in the bar. To make a long story short, the wizards nuked us both down fast since we were 
over-confident and cocky. We were soon seeking rezes. Resistance gear is highly recommended. They are most commonly seen in the bar area, which is deep 
enough that you don't want any adds. Should you end up with a train, the area near the entrance can be tricky if you have not run up and down it many 
times. Falling here can result in some nasty corpse retrievals. [Yes, I even feel to my death in the lava trying to get away from a train we made, so I am 
speaking from experience here.] Should you fall in this area, corpses are hard to drag out of the lava. I recommend just dying some place more convenient 
to save yourself the hassle of seeking out someone who can summon dead bodies.</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('rune_of_ivy-left-old')">Rune of Ivy [Left]</A><BR>
The Rune of Ivy [Left] drops off GrimFeather in North Karana. All mobs in this zone are on the same spawn table, so just keep killing stuff until it spawns. 
One nice thing about this area though is that you can hunt Highland Lions for High Quality Lion Skins [needed for Fleeting Quivers] and bears for High Quality 
Bear Skins [needed for 10-slot backpacks] while you are hunting GrimFeather. I have seen GrimFeather spawn somewhat regularly when I go lion hunting. As 
far as I can tell, the Rune of Ivy will drop every time. I have yet to see a GrimFeather without one.</P>

<P>Two Star Rubies<BR>
These can be purchased at jewelry suppry vendors.</P>

<HR>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('ivy_etched_gauntlets-old')"><B>Ivy Etched Gauntlets</B></A></P>

<P>This quest is given by Leaf Falldim at the Kithicor Ranger Guild. The key phrase to trigger this quest is 'Who is Maldyn Greenburn.'</P>

<P>Turn in items for this quest:<BR>
- Broken Bow Part A<BR>
- Broken Bow Part B</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('broken_bow_part_a-old')">Broken Bow Part A</A><BR>
Broken Bow Part A drops off Maldyn the Unkempt in Rathetear Mountains. Camping Maldyn the Unkempt is a multi-part problem, which I will go over 
individually. There are three possible place holders: a drake, Hasten Bootstrutter and Brother Zephyl. The drake and Hasten Bootstrutter are the most 
common place holders. Brother Zephyl is the rare place holder, but he is still more common than Maldyn the Unkempt. The drake will be easy to kill and 
should cause no problems. Hasten Bootstrutter and Brother Zephyl will be impossible for anyone of level range to do these quests. Hasten is around Level 
40. If you are lucky, there will be either some high level evil people who like the faction free fun or a high level ranger who has a deep resentment of Hasten 
due to this quest. In either case, Hasten will be killed for you. Brother Zephyl on the other hand is Level 60. He is a mob/npc for the Robe of the Lost Circle, 
which is a sub-part of the Monk Epic Quest. The only thing that will get rid of him fast is if some monk comes through and decides he wants to kill Brother 
Zephyl for the robe. Otherwise, he will be up for hours before he finally despawns. The second part of the problem is that Maldyn the Unkempt has a bad 
habit of getting himself killed. He spawns near the guard tower in the main hill giant area. If you don't get to him fast, something will come along and kill 
him.</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('broken_bow_part_b-old')">Broken Bow Part B</A><BR>
Broken Bow Part B drops of Slaythe the Slayer in the "live side" of Lower Guk. Don't let the whole "live side" and "dead side" thing fool you if you have never 
been there before. This is all one zone and sometimes undead mobs that look like zombie frogloks wander into the live area. Slaythe the Slayer spawns in a 
dead end near the jail area. Although I have read that he is on a spawn/despawn cycle and has a place holder, I have always seen him on tracking.</P>
 
<HR>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('ivy_etched_tunic-old')"><B>Ivy Etched Tunic</B></A></P>

<P>This quest is given by Gandari in the Kithikor Woods Ranger Guild. The key phrase to trigger the quest is 'I am interested in Tunic.'</P>

<P>Turn in items for this quest:<BR>
- Rubies<BR>
- Rune of Ivy [Right]<BR>
- Skull of Meldtrath</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('rune_of_ivy-right-old')">Rune of Ivy [Right]</A><BR>
The Rune of Ivy [Right] drops off of Thistle Underbrush in Lesser Faydark. This is a named brownie that wanders the zone. He is generally easy to kill but 
runs very fast. However, any of the Brownie Scouts that wander the area as well are not, but they will not argo on anyone who is in Wolf Form. The Rune 
of Ivy does not drop every time, but drops often enough that it will not be necessary to kill him multiple times. If Thistle Underbrush is not up, someone else 
may be killing him.</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('skull_of_meldrath-old')">Skull of Meldrath</A><BR>
The Skull of Meldrath drops off Meldrath the Malignant in Steamfont Mountains. This is a gnome necromancer. He has a pet and two minotaurs guarding him. 
Magic resistance gear is highly recommended as he can fear you. There is nothing more annoying than being fear kited by a necro mob. Anyway, he does not 
drop the skull every time, so you may have to kill him several times before it drops.</P>

<P>Two Rubies<BR>
These can be purchased at jewelry suppry vendors.</P>

<HR>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('ivy_etched_leggings-old')"><B>Ivy Etched Leggings</B></A></P>

<P>This quest is given by Leaf Falldim at the Kithicor Ranger Guild. The key phrase to trigger this quest is 'What about Ivy Etched Leggings.'</P>

<P>Turn in items for this quest:<BR>
- Quiver of Kithicor - Full<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <A href="javascript:popupInventory('arrow_of_acknowledgement-old')">Arrow of Acknowledgment</A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <A href="javascript:popupInventory('arrow_of_bravery-old')">Arrow of Bravery</A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <A href="javascript:popupInventory('arrow_of_defiance-old')">Arrow of Defiance</A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <A href="javascript:popupInventory('arrow_of_fortitude-old')">Arrow of Fortitude</A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <A href="javascript:popupInventory('arrow_of_gallantry-old')">Arrow of Gallantry</A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <A href="javascript:popupInventory('arrow_of_recognition-old')">Arrow of Recognition</A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Quiver of Kithicor<BR>
- Star of Odus</P>

<P>Quiver of Kithicor<BR>
The Quiver of Kithicor drops off Wiltin Windwalker on Gornit Isle in Ocean of Tears. This item is a container, so you will need to have a General Inventory slot 
free when you finally get to loot it. If you do not, it will poof as the item is no drop and will not be able to fall to the ground. This may have been corrected as 
I have seen no drop items drop to my cursor when I didn't have room for them. I would not depend on this happening and just have the space for it. Wiltin 
Windwalker's placeholder is a Buccaneer. Do not attack the Buccaneer as you could end up waiting two hours for a respawn. If you camp Wiltin Windwalker 
without attacking the Buccaneer, the Buccaneer will despawn after an hour. Either Wiltin Windwalker or the Buccaneer will spawn a few minutes later. The 
Buccaneer is very common and Wiltin Windwindwalker is rare. Camping him is more of a test of patience than anything else.</P>

<P>The Six Named Arrows<BR>
The six named arrows are random drops off the Brownie Outcasts in Lesser Faydark. They all spawn near the pixie tower, which is not far from the fairie 
village. The pixies in this area are place holders for the Brownie Outcasts so be sure to kill them as well. The arrows are lore, so it is not possible to 
accidently get two of the same arrow. However, the arrows you need are: Acknowledgment, Bravery, Defiance, Gallantry, Fortitude and Recognition. Place 
one of each arrow in the Quiver of Kithicor, and combine the quiver to get the "Quiver of Kithicor - full"</P>

<P>Star of Odus<BR>
Go to the jewlrey shop in Erudin and buy a Star of Odus. This is not sold anywhere else in Norrath.</P>

<HR>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('ivy_etched_boots-old')"><B>Ivy Etched Boots</B></A></P>

<P>This quest is given by Leaf Falldim at the Kithicor Ranger Guild. The key phrase to trigger this quest is 'I will earn the Ivy Etched Boots.'</P>

<P>Turn in items for this quest:<BR>
- 2000 GP<BR>
- Mistmoore Granite<BR>
- a bar of Ronium<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 2 Enchanted Bars of Platium<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Melatite<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mistmoore Granite<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Sand of Ro<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Soil of Underfoot [4 Fairy Dust]<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Sol Cauldron</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('a_bar_of_ronium-old')">a bar of Ronium</A><BR>
Once you have all of the ingredients in the Sol Cauldron, press the combine button to produce a Bar of Ronium.</P>

<P>2 Enchanted Bars of Platinum<BR>
You will need to deal with an enchanter for this one. Either by buying two pre-enchanted bars or buy having him enchant them for you. Place two Enchanted 
Bars of Platinum in the Sol Cauldron.</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('melatite-old')">Melatite</A><BR>
Melatite drops of the gnomish robots in the Gnome area of Solusek's Eye. It is a rare drop and killing these produces bad gnome faction. Not just in Solusek's 
Eye, where they sell Tinkerer Bags, but back in Ak'Akanon as well. The best thing to do here is to check the gnome merchants as you will sometimes see 
them selling it due to someone killing the robots but still having sufficient faction to deal with the merchants. If this doesn't work, I recommend having 
someone kill the robots for you to get the Melatite. However you decide to do it, put one Melatite in the Sol Cauldron.</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('mistmoore_granite-old')">Mistmoore Granite</A><BR>
Go to Mitmoore Castle and kill Fouting Gargoyles, Jeering Gargoyles or Leering Gargoyles for Mistmoore Granite. The granite drops very rarely off of the 
Gargoyles outside of the castle. You have a better chance of getting the Granite inside of the castle. There are two Gargoyles in the main entrance room, 
a group of four right before the Kitchen and one in each of the servant rooms. There are several other places where you will find Gargoyles, but these are 
perhaps the safest places to hunt them. Once you get two pieces of Granite, place one in the Sol Cauldron and set the other aside to be turned in 
separately.</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('sand_of_ro-old')">Sand of Ro</A><BR>
Go to the Oasis of Marr and kill Sand Giants until you get the Sand of Ro. You can also find Sand Giants in South Ro though they are not nearly as common 
there. Place the Sands of Ro in the cauldron.</P>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('soil_of_underfoot-old')">Soil of Underfoot</A><BR>
Soil of Underfoot is made from Fairy Dust. Unfortunately, to do the Rain Caller quest properly, you cannot go and slay fairies. Since Fairy Dust is tradeable, 
the smart thing to do here is to get someone else to do the vile fairy slaying for you. You will need four Fairy Dust. More than likely Priestess Ghalea of the 
Kaladim Cleric Guild won't like you. I have no idea what her problem is, but it can be solved with lots and lots of bone chips. Check out the nearby Paladin 
guild. Give Gunlok Jure four Bone Chips at a time to get the faction you need. You can then give Priestess Ghalea the four Fairy Dusts to receive the Soil of 
Underfoot. Place this item in the Sol Cauldron.</P>

<P>Sol Cauldron:<BR>
This will be given to you by Lord Searfire in the Temple of Solusek Ro. More than likely, your faction with him will not be sufficient to receive the cauldron. 
There are serveral ways to gain faction with him:<BR>
- Kill many Shadowed Men.<BR>
- Give 30 GP at a time to Rathmana Allin in South Ro.<BR>
- Give 4 Cutthroat Insignia Rings to Ortallius in South Ro.<BR>
- Go to the graveyard in Mistmoore Castle. Take the flower of the coffin and give it to the named Shadowed Man behind the crypt.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Faction</B></P>

<P>Rangers doing these quests and turning in all the items themselves should not have any faction issues unless they have been killing things that they 
should not have been. Faction may be of a concern if doing a multiquest on these quests, where the other person is evil or has poor ranger faction. I believe 
that both of the turn-in NPCS are on Kithicor Residents faction, but have not actually confirmed this. They could also possibly be on a faction related to 
Surefall Glade.</P>
