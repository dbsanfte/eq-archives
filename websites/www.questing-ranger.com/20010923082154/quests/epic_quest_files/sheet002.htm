<P><B>QUEST WALKTHROUGH INTRO</B></P>

<P>Although it is possible to do portions of the quest out of order, this walkthrough assumes that you complete each part 
before moving on to the next section. Just in case you have done portions of the quest out of order, I have made note of what items you 
would have if you have been doing the quest in the exact order listed here and which of those are required to complete that part of the 
quest.</P>

<P>NOTE: If at any point in the quest you need to use sneak to deal with an NPC, you will need to use sneak again at all later 
encounters. Although I will suggest using sneak the during the first encounter with a potentially problematic NPC, you will need to remember 
to use it again for later encounters. This mostly concerns Kinlo Strongarm and Mairee Silentone.</P>
