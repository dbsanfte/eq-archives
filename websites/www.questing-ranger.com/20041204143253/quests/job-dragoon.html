<P><B>Dragoon Job Quest</B></P>

<P><B>The Holy Crest</B><BR>
Client: Oiheaurese<BR>
Location: Cathderal Manuscript Room [L-7]<BR>
Requirements: Level 30+, Rank 2 if San d'Orian, Rank 3 if from Bastok or Windurst<BR>
Items: Pickaxe, Wyvern Egg<BR>
Reward: Dragoon Job</P>

<P>First you will want to talk to Arminibit and Ceraulian, who are located in Cargo Room A of Port San d'Oria. Once this is done, you need to head to the Bostaunieux 
Oubliette, take the first right and continue down the hall until you see Novalmauge wandering the corridor. To get to the Bostaunieux Oubliette, you need to go though 
Chateau d'Oraguille. If you cannot enter Chateau d'Oraguille, your Mission Rank level is not high enough. Citizens of San d'Oria need to be Rank 2. Citizens of either Bastok or 
Windurst need to be on Mission 3 and have spoken to their respective ambassador in San d'Oria. You will now want talk to Morjean in the Manuscript Room of the Cathedrial in 
North San d'Oria. Oiheaurese will show up during the intermission and you will be given the quest at this point.</P>

<P>You will now need to get a Pickaxe [only one should do] and head to the Maze of Shakhrami. While most walk throughs I have seen recommend entering from the Buburimu 
Peninsula side, I recommend that you enter from Tahrongi Canyon. The mobs are lower in level and if you are doing this at Level 30 exactly they will not agro on you. [Whereas if 
you enter from the Buburimu Peninsula side at Level 30, they will agro.] You will need to find an Excavation Point. [My recommendation here is to print out the maps for this 
area that are available from the <A HREF="http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/gulif/ziq_topeng.html" TARGET="_blank">Mining Logging Harvesting Excavition Map</A> website. Once you 
have located the Excavation Point, use a pickaxe on it to get the Wyvern Egg.</P>

<P>Return to Morjean in the Cathedrial Manuscript Room in order to continue on with the quest. You will now need to go to Meriphataud Mountains and head towards the area 
labeled "Dragon Spine" the map that is around the zone to Castle Oztroja.</P> The weapon type mobs around here will agro. I recommend finding a spot away from the mobs 
where you can put up sneak and invisibility if you have it. Along the white thing in the [K-8] section, you will find a "???" spot. Trade the Wyvern Egg to it, which will result in 
an intermission.</P>

<P>You now will want to go to Chateau d'Oraguille in North San d'Oria, then talk to Rahal in the Royal Knights area. Once this is done, head to Ghelsba Outpost to the hut at 
[G-10] the investigate the door for the boss fight. I cannot really comment on the fight as I did it solo. If you're doing it at L30 though, you will need to bring some friends. 
Once the dragon is defeated, there will be an intermission where the wyvern proves to be holy and you'll be able to name it.</P>

<P>If you go to Norg, there is an NPC that you can pay approximately 10k gil to get a list of additional names for you Wyvern.</P>
