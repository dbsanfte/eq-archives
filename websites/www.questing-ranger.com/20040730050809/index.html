<P>7-29-2004: I've removed the "Summerfest 2004" link on this page as well as some old update notices. The "print" link on the menu header was removed as I felt that it was 
needlessly enlarging the file sizes thus causing the site to load slower in the long run. I've also added a link back to this page on all pages of the site. Additionally the color 
scheme has been modified slightly to appear more bright and cheerful... I felt that the dark background was starting to look a bit gloomy. Some other things have also been 
moved around... the spells and equipment were relocated to the new "bards" section. I've also added a section for guilds as I felt that I wanted to do more with it. There's also 
a few completely new things in the extras section.</P>

<P>7-28-2004: No major updates lately. Between Summerfest and farming gil, I have not done much of anything new. Still no sign of "Goldfish Scooping" anywhere within FFXI. 
=( Click on the Summerfest banner below to go straight to the summerfest page, which features both screen shots and quests for this special event. Because these quests are 
for a limited time, I most likely will not be adding them to the main quest area.</P>

<P>7-23-2004: Added sections to the gallery for artifact armor and regions. I've also added a section for random miscellaneous images that do not fit into any of the other 
categories.</P>

<P>7-22-2004: Added two new subsections to the gallery area. One for pictues of Notorious Monsters and the other for Summoner Aeons. These two sections are complete for 
the time being until I take more screen shots.</P>

<P>7-20-2004: Several more quests were added - <A HREF="/quests/jeuno-upper.html">A Candlelight Vigil</A>, 
<A HREF="quests/sandoria-port.html">A Job for the Consortium</A>, <A HREF="/quests/jeuno-upper.html">Candle Making</A> and 
<A HREF="/quests/jeuno-lower.html">The Goblin Tailor</A>. I've also updated the walkthrough for <A HREF="/quests/town-selbina.html">An Explorer's Footsteps</A>, which 
rewards you with the Map of Crawler's Nest.</P>

<P>07-19-2004: Extras section was added.</P>

<P>07-17-2004: Some changes were made to the equipment section. I still want to add images, but the factual data is at least complete for now.</P>

<P>07-08-2004: I got two more of the stone monuments for the Crawler's Nest Map quest [under Selbina quests] and rearanged the order that they are listed to be in 
chronological order according to the date on the monuments. I also added the second mog house upgrade quest as well as the summoner job quest. Other than getting 
Carbuncle's Ruby, which is just rare in a very lame and extremely tedious way [which doesn't make it hard just lame and tedious] - this job quest has been very very easy.</P>

<P>07-07-2004: EverQuest faqs have been moved off site. Akanesotome Asha`man has kindly given some space for them thus you can now access them all at the following 
URL: <A HREF="http://www.thefellowshipquests.com/ranger/">http://www.thefellowshipquests.com/ranger/</A>. As for my site, you'll notice that I've added a new section 
called "regions" which is still being worked on.</P>
