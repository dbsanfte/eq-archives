<P><B>Swarm of Pain and Icewind [LoY Spells] Quests FAQ</B><BR>
by Crydee Ossiriand, Torvonnilous Server<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.questing-ranger.com">http://www.questing-ranger.com</A><BR>
Version: 2004.06.01</P>

<P>This faq covers obtaining the two Legend of Ykesha spells. While I have only found Icewind to actually be useful, Swam of Pain is very easy to do by 
yourself. Gaudric Stormwynd can be found in Gulf of Gunthak, where he is studying the island. Aide him in his research, and he will reward you with newly 
discovered spells.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Gaudric Stormwynd'<BR>
Gaudric Stormwynd says 'Greetings, Crydee. What brings you to this forsaken rock? I have been sent here by the council of Surefall Glade to gather 
information about this Island. This place seethes with anger and hatred, and even the familiar [winds] of Karana blow with a cold bite. So far the creatures 
have all proved very hostile, even to a follow of Karana. I suspect that the curse of Innoruuk has caused them be very aggressive towards all outsiders. I 
have been able to gather some information on a new race of [insect] though'</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Swarm of Pain</B></P>

<P>You say, 'what insect'<BR>
Gaudric Stormwynd says 'A strange group of ant like creatures that I've named Nifiliks seems to be native to the island. I've never encountered creatures 
quite like this. They seem to have a sort of Hive consciousness. They have a vast range in size. The smallest are barely an inch or two across, while the 
largest can be upwards of four feet tall. The larger ones seem to be able to control the smaller ones by some sort of audible communication. I've heard the 
strange noises they make, but have yet to [mimic] them.'</P>

<P>You say, 'why cant you mimic them?'<BR>
Gaudric Stormwynd says 'The smallest ones do not seem to have as developed of a nervous system as the larger ones. They only act on the instincts and the 
commands of their masters. If we're able to mimic the sounds that they make, we may be able to control the smaller ones. If you're able to capture one of 
them alive and allow me to listen to its sounds I may be able to mimic them. You'll also need to bring me one of the smaller ones so I can observe its 
reactions.'</P>

<P><A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('a_captured_nifilik')">a captured nifilik</A> and 
<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('a_tiny_nifilik')">a tiny nifilik</A><BR>
These are dropped by the Broken Skull Nifiliks that spawn randomly all over the beach and can spawn almost anywhere. Except for a fewspots that only 
spawn undead, all mobs in the area can be considered place holders.</P>

<P>*Give Gaudric Stormwynd a captured nifilik and a tiny nifilik*<BR>
Gaudric Stormwynd takes the small nifilik and places it on the ground at his feet.  He then partially unties the larger one causing it to let out some sort of 
high-pitched wailing. The small niflik on the table immediately begins to run across the ground toward you. You try to jump away but the nifilik still manages 
to latch onto your boot and crawl up under your armor. You howl in pain as the tiny creature bites repeatedly at your skin. Gaudric rebinds the larger nifilik 
and it stops wailing. The tiny creature below your armor stops biting at your skin.<BR>
Gaudric Stormwynd begins to scrawl several runes on a parchment and then hands it to you. 'I believe I've worked it out now. Unfortunately, our voices won't 
be able to make the sounds necessary to control these creatures, but with the help of Karana's magic you'll be able to imitate the sounds enough to control 
the small creatures. Use their power wisely, Crydee. As you know their bite is quite painful.</P>

<P>You then receive <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('spell_swarm_of_pain')">Spell: Swarm of Pain</A></P>

<HR>

<P><B>Icewind</B></P>

<P>You say, 'what winds'<BR>
Gaudric Stormwynd says 'The fury of a truly torrential storm is a beautiful thing. Even in their destruction they bring the birth of new life. Such is the cycle 
of life on Norrath, from the ashes nature always rebuilds. The trolls care nothing for this cycle though, and merely use the power of the storm to fill their 
treasuries. I hear the tormented cries of tempest [spirits] across the wind.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what spirits'<BR>
Gaudric Stormwynd says 'I believe the followers of Nadox have found a way to control the spirits of the tempest by capturing them in amulets made of the 
black rock from the island. Bring me one of their amulets and I may be able to free the spirit from it.'</P>

<P><A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('a_glowing_zraxthril_amulet')">A glowing zraxthril amulet</A><BR>
These are dropped by the Broken Skull Adherent. They all spawn in this one room which has a pillar in the middle of it. While these mobs are technically 
soloable to a Level 65 ranger, the fight can still be tough to do solo as they can easily gate. This should take no more than one group at most to do. It can 
be noted that High Priest Grumsalsot can also spawn in this room.</P>

<P>*Give Gaudric Stormwynd A glowing zraxthril amulet*<BR>
Gaudric Stormwynd takes the amulet from your hand and holds it in front of his eyes. He begins to speak arcane words into the stone, holding his other hand 
under the amulet. The amulet begins to spasm around crazily on its cord as if some creature were trying to escape from it. Sweat begins to bead up on 
Gaudric's brow. Suddenly the amulet explodes with light and Gadric is thrown to the ground. You reach down and careful pick up the amulet from the ground. 
You notice a large crack across the face.</P>

<P><I>You receive A Cracked Zraxthril Amulet</I></P>

<P>A watery visage begins to rise from the crack in the amulet and take shape before you. The tempest spirit coalesces into a vaguely humanoid form and 
motions toward you. He points directly to the amulet in your hands.</P>

<P>*Give A Cracked Zraxthril Amulet to A Tempest Spirit.*<BR>
A Tempest Spirit takes the amulet from you and holds it in his watery hand. The wind around you rises and the sea begins to swell. The spirit melts into a 
swirling pool at your feet. You gaze down into the pool and notice it begin to shrink in circumference. It continues to shrink and spin until finally there is 
nothing left but a small blue amulet on the ground. You reach to pick it up and hear a voice echo from the sea. 'Call us and we will aid you.'</P>

<P>You then receive <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('spell_icewind')">Spell: Icewind</A></P>
