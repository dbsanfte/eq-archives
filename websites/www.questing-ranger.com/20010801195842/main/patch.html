<P CLASS="header2">Patch Changes</P>

<P CLASS="header1">Epic Quests</P>

<P CLASS="text">Magician Epic<BR>
With the recent changes to Lesser Faydark, the faeries have all become undead sprites. All items, including the Power of Earth, which used to 
drop off of Faerie Guards now drop off of Undead Sprites. This was not announced in the patch messages.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Necromancer Epic<BR>
** Quest Changes **<BR>
The Black Silk Cape will now drop more frequently.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Ranger and Druid Epics<BR>
** Zone and Quest Changes **<BR>
We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal remains. Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to trigger the 
spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only be dropping items for those epic quests.  Hopefully these changes will dramatically 
reduce the competition and resentment over this spawn.<BR>
<I>Karnor's came down recently on all servers a few days ago for a server-side fix. [No patch message or download] Only this zone was taken 
down. After Karnor's came back up again, the Spirit of Venril Sathir was once again spawning. This portion of the ranger and druid epic quests 
can be completed again.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">Shaman Epic<BR>
It wasn't documented in a patch as far as I can recall. However, the Iksar Child in Plane of Fear is now called an Iksar Broodling.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Warrior Epics<BR>
** Emergency Patch Update **<BR>
We're sorry that we've had to patch again so quickly. We found a problem with the change we made to the Red Scabbard. This patch is intended 
primarily to fix that issue.<BR>
** Item Changes **<BR>
We've made a change to the Red Scabbard that should relieve most of the problems warriors were having with their epic weapon occasionally 
disappearing during conversion between the two-handed weapon and the two one-handed weapons. What will happen now is rather simple. The 
very next time you use the container to combine the weapons (or break them apart), the old scabbard will disappear and a new one will replace 
it.<BR>
THE NEW SCABBARD AND THE SWORDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CURSOR, rather than in your inventory. So once you have combined them, make 
sure to place them in your inventory. And don't panic, the items didn't disappear. :) But also MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE ROOM IN YOUR 
INVENTORY FOR ALL THREE ITEMS (the two swords and the scabbard, which is a container and needs to be able to fit into your main inventory). 
If you end up with a No-Drop container on your cursor with no place to put it in your inventory, you will have a problem...<BR>
Also, right now the new scabbard is a little bugged. Right now you won't be able to open the new scabbard until you camp out once after it is 
created. We're working on fixing that bug. We decided to make this change even with this small bug to help relieve everyone of the problems 
with the old scabbard.<BR>
This new scabbard will have a special ability. It will be able to recreate the epic weapons if you have lost them. Simply place a Sword of Runes 
(summoned by a Magician) into the scabbard and hit the combine button. The scabbard will convert the temporary power of the Sword of Runes 
into the permanent epic sword.<BR>
Customer Service WILL NOT be replacing the old scabbards with the new ones. That will be done by the game itself once you have completed 
the quest and combined the swords for the first time.</P>
