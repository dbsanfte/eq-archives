<P>05-17-2004: "QuarmTron: Defender of Time" movie is now available for watching in the gallery section.</P>

<CENTER><A HREF="/gallery/index.html"><IMG SRC="images/main/news-quarmtron.jpg" WIDTH="234" HEIGH="176"></A></CENTER>

<P>05-14-2004: Uploaded part of the indulgence section a few days ago as well as some lore concerning EverQuest.</P>

<P>05-02-2004: A few more FAQs are back online, including some non-eq faqs. All eq related faqs received a minor update to the file naming, which had no 
impact on the actual content. I also worked on the QuarmTron movie a bit more.</P>

<P>04-29-2004: Several more FAQs uploaded, including "The Scepter of Shadows," which has been missing for a long time. I also have several flash movies 
in progress at the moment. One is actually at the stage of being edited, and you can click on the below image to go straight to the gallery section for a few 
preview images.</P>

<P>04-28-2004 - Update #3: Several more FAQs. I also made a slight modification for faqs that use the original style inventory for the item stats image so 
that the popup window is not bigger than it really needs to be.</P>

<P>04-28-2004 - Update #2: Added the Planar Progression [POP] FAQ. I updated the "print this page script" I'm using for all faqs so that it will print the faq 
out without any extraneous formating that maintains the look and feel of my website, which isn't necessarily friendly or desirable when looking at a printed out 
copy. I will most like to at least one more update later today.</P>

<P>04-28-2004: Two FAQs have been readded to the site: The Binden Concerrentia [POP] and Swiftwind &amp; Earthcaller [Kunark.] I will continue to be 
adding a few each day until they are all back online. The next update should be sometime in the later on today.</P>

<P>04-27-2004: Questing-Ranger is partially online. My overall goal was to remove the javascript drop-down menu and background pattern, lighten up the 
color scheme a little bit so that the site would not look so dark and revamp the gallery so it wasn't so much an image gallery but a collection of things. The 
revamp was delayed a bit due to a need to replace my entire computer as well as modify my arching processes so as to be more manageable. The lore, faqs 
and indulgence sections remain offline at the moment but the page links work. The links page is back up simply because it was the easiest, so I completed it 
first. The gallery is partially online. I'm still deciding if I want to bring back any of the actual image gallery. In any case, I have added the shockwave christmas 
card I made last year and a few other things there. I plan to have daily updates for a while while I am working on getting everything back online.</P>
