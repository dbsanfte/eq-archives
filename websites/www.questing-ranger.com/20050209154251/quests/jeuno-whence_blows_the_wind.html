<P><B>Whence Blows the Wind</B><BR>
Client: Maat<BR>
Location: Grand Duke Palace [H-5]<BR>
Requirements: Level 56+, Atop the Highest Mountain<BR>
Items: Orc Crest, Quadav Crest, Yagudo Crest<BR>
Reward: Level Cap of 65<BR>
Title: Sky Breaker</P>

<P>Summary: Your innate limits can be pushed further by collecting the crests of the Orcs, the Quadav, and the Yagudo.</P>

<P>Orc Crest [Davoi / Monastic Cavern]<BR>
This one has a mini-quest that needs to be done in order to gain access to the area where the crest is. While it is true that one person can do the subquest than open the portal 
for a bunch of people, it will be necessary to reopen the portal for them again afterwards or warp them out. You cannot pass through the portal either way unless someone that 
has the subquest opens it.</P>

<P>To do the subquest:<BR>
Enter Davoi the head to H-11 to enter the Monastic Caverns. Work your way though here then cross a bridge. If you go right, you will come to a glowing wall with three orcs 
guarding it. You need to touch the wall. If you time it right, you can do this while all three orcs are looking away then reinvisible yourself before they know anyone is there. Not 
far from here is a fort area where you will find Sedal-Godjal. Talk to him and the actual subquest will start. [If he does not give you the subquest, it is because you have not 
touched the wall first.] There are four colored pools that you need to inspect at this point:<BR>
- North from H-6, then head right<BR>
- NW corner of H-10<BR>
- NW corner of E-8<BR>
- NE corner of L-9<BR>
Also there is a spot with a broken bridge that you can jump off it to skip running through Monastic Cavern again. If you do this, just go North to get the pool past H-6. I 
recommend getting the one at L-9 last. You will get Cursed on the last one, regardless of the order, so it is best that this be one with very easy mobs. Return to Sedal-Godjal at 
this point to complete the miniquest.</P>

<P>With the subquest done, you are ready to get the crest. Head to that glowing wall again and wait for the orcs to look away. Drop invisible then click on the wall. You will 
be able to walk through it and zone over into the Monastic Cavern. Once inside, you will want to hug the left wall. If you go straight out, you may encouner a Notorious Monster 
that will kill you. When you reach J-6, look around for an ??? as this is where the crest is.</P>

<P>Quadav Crest [Beadeaux]<BR>
One thing to keep in mind here is that Quadav only detect by sound. While the sheep in the zone do detect by sight, they should be "Too Weak to Be Worthwhile" thus will not 
agro. Elementals will only agro if you cast around them. Overall, you will only need sneak to get through Beadeaux thus making this part rather easy to complete solo. There are 
two types of machines in the zones: Mute and Afflicator. Mute Machines will silence you if you examine them. Afflicator Machines will curse you if go near them, unless you are 
silenced. I went through this part as BRD/WHM so found it easier to allow myself to get cursed then find a reasonably safe spot to wait for the curse to pass thus allowing me to 
retain the ability to cast sneak.</P>

<P>From where you enter Beadeaux, go to [H-7] and into the tunnel. Once inside, go to [F-8] to get back outside. This will put you on the upper level of the outside area. You 
will want to head toward the Northeast portion of the map. If you have not been using Sneak yet due to the mobs being Too Weak, you'll find that when you get to the halfway 
point between the Northeast and Southwest portions of the map that Sneak will be neccsary, Head to [K-7] and look for a ramp that leads you down to the lower part of the 
outside area. Not far from here, there will be a tunnel at [K-6] which you will enter. Inside the tunnel, go to [M-8] to zone into the Qulum Dome.</P>

<P>Once inside the Qulum Dome, you'll want to put sneak back up again. There are some NM Quadav that path through this area, so procede with caution. [When I passed 
through, there was a high level red mage killing them so I cannot speak of their agro intensity. It is best to assume that NMs will see through both sneak and invisible until proven 
otherwise, so make sure their back is turned before you go by them.] If you have the map for Beadeaux [which also includes the Qulum Dome], you'll want to look at it now. 
Between [I-6] and [I-7] on the map there is a horizontal line marking the boundry between these these two map positions. The Quadav Crest is located along this line on the 
ground at the far left side of the room this takes you to.</P>

<P>Yagudo Crest [Castle Oztroja]<BR>
While you will need invisible to get through this part, you will want to procede with caution and hug the edge of the wall when going through the room with leeches. You will also 
need to either be able to cast Warp or have a Warp Scroll with you if you do not wish to bloodport out afterwards. Also this part of Genkai 3 is not soloable at all. For one thing it 
is neccesary to drop invisible at several points to access door switches. The mobs at the first door switch should be too weak and not agro, but the two at the second will be 
high enough to agro at L60 plus it can take several minutes to figure out the correct sequences of switches to open the door. While I do not have direction to get through here, 
I can tell you that your goal is to get to the room on Map 4 that is off the map on the below links. This room is represeneted by a red dot that is not on the map. To get through 
the final door, located at [H-7] on Map 4, you need to get someone to light one of the 4 torches. For this you need to either clear out the Yagudo or have someone with Flee. If 
you have someone with Flee, have everyone else go Invisible the wait at the Brass Door for it to be opened. Once on the other side, the door can be reopened to allow the fleer 
in.</P>

<P>Technically you are supposed to wander through Castle Oztroja and get the three passwords from three different statues. However these three passwords reset at the start 
of every game day so it is a lot easier to just skip this part and just guess at the passwords, which can be entered in any order. If you enter a password and you are asked to 
enter another, then you have found one of the passwords. Keep trying all the words on the list until it accepts three: Mong, Deggi, Duzu, Mjuu, Ouzi, Xicv, Ovzi, Buxu, Haqa, 
Gadu, Puqu, Duxo, Zhuu. Should you find yourself coming short, passwords were all taken from the names of notorious monster Yagudo. For example, "Mjuu" comes from Hoo Mjuu 
the Torrent who drops the Monster Signa. Additional words from NM Yaguo names can be found at the below link.</P>

<P>Once you have entered three correct passwords, you will fall through the wooden floor with the red circle on it. The Yagudo Crest is out in the open in this area. You'll want 
to put Invisible back up, but keep in mind that the casters will see you anyway. About halfway up the platform, you'll find a "???" which is where the crest is. Pretarget the spot, 
then drop invisible, examine it then immediately warp out.</P>
