<P><B>White Mage Quest Spells</B></P>

<P><B>Acting in Good Faith</B> [Teleport-Mea]<BR>
Client: Gantineux<BR>
Location: Hostelry Room, Windurst Waters [E-10]<BR>
Reward: Scroll of Teleport-Mea</P>

<P>The Hostelry Rooms can be found between the Timbre Timbers Tavern and Rarab Tail Hostelry. When you talk to Gantineux, he will give you the key item "Spirit Incense." You 
will now need to go to Eldieme Necropolis. There are three entrances to check: [G-7], [H-7] and [I-6]. In here you are looking for one of the torches to be targetable with a "???" 
spot. Sneak will help keep the undead from agroing. When you find the "???," just inspect it. Return to Gantineux and he will send you to talk to Eperdur in San d'Oria. Talk to 
Eperdur at this point to get the spell.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Altana's Sorrow</B> [Telepot-Dem]<BR>
Client: Virnage<BR>
Location: Bat's Lair Inn, Bastok Mines [J-8]<BR>
Reward: Scroll of Teleport-Dem</P>

<P>Head to Garlaige Citadel to the area around G-8 and H-8 to look for a "???" spot. Once someone examines the spot, it immediately despawns but will respawn somewhere else 
in the same area. I wasn't sure if it was respawning immediately but even if it is not, the wait was not long. Once you have examined it, return to Virnage and talk to him again. 
You will now want to go to the Cathedral in North San d'Oria to talk to Eperdur, who will give you the spell.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Healing the Land</B> [Teleport-Holla]<BR>
Client: Eperdur<BR>
Location: Cathedral, North San d'Oria [M-7]<BR>
Reward: Scroll of Teleport-Holla</P>

<P>You'll want to go to Gusgen Mines. You mostly need just sneak to get around here if you are doing this at or around L37 as only undead will agro. Your goal here is to work 
your way to [G-8] then look for a "???" spot that is behind a shed. To get here, you will need to go straight ahead then go through the door on the left side. On the next map, 
go to the upper-left corner to where the path loops around and downward. This leads to another map, and the "???" spot will be towards the left side of the dead end. Examine it 
then return to Eperdur.</P>
