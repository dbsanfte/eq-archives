<P><B>Rune of Ivy [Bottom]</B></P>

<P>The Rune of Ivy [Bottom] is a random drop off Redwind, who is a shadow knight orc in Everfrost. He does have a pet with him. There are 
two ways to do this. You can use Harmony to pull the orcs around him and pick them off one by one then kill Redwind or you can use 
Harmony to single pull just Redwind. It really gets down to how much orc slaying you wish to do.</P>

<P><B>Water Ring</B></P>

<P>The Water Ring is a random drop off the Aqua Goblin Tidal Lord in Dagnor's Cauldron. The mob is easy to kill, but I found that the ring does 
not drop more often than it does. This mob will spawn at the goblin camps in the zone and wanders about. The easiest way to get this is to 
clear out the goblin camp that is not far from Unrest the check tracking to see if any are up. When you cannot find any Aqua Goblin Tidal 
Lords on tracking, just hang out at the camp until one spawns. Be sure to check back at the camp periodically to clear out any undesirbale 
goblin spawns before they start to wander about the zone.</P>

<P><B>Fire Emerald</B></P>
