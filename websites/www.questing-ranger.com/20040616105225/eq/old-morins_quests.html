<P><B>Corrupted Shissar Weapons  [Shissarbane] FAQ</B><BR>
by Crydee Ossiriand, Torvonnilous Server<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.questing-ranger.com">http://www.questing-ranger.com</A><BR>
Version: 2004.06.01</P>

<P>These are actually two separate quests, which can be done independently of each other. They are however linked to each other though NPC dialogue 
with Morin Shadowbane in Kithcor Forest. Completing the quest for the Short Sword of Morin becomes the starting point for the quest for Orc Impaler.</P>

<HR>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('short_sword_of_morin')"><B>Short Sword of Morin</B></A></P>

<P>This quest starts with Morin Shadowbane in Kithikor Woods.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Morin Shadowbane'<BR>
Morin Shadowbane says 'Hail, Crydee! I am the leader of this beleaguered troop of rangers. Even though the once fair Kithicor slowly succumbs to the 
[darkness] at hand, we shall not abandon the woods without a fight.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what about the darkness?'<BR>
Morin Shadowbane says 'The denizens of these woods are slowly being overrun by dark fiends and shadowed men. As valiantly as we have fought, our 
numbers dwindle. We know very little about our aggressors, but if we [acquire some information] or perhaps [fine weapons], then we may yet have a chance 
to retake the woods once more.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what fine weapons?'
Morin Shadowbane says 'My soldiers are valiant, but poorly equipped. I have heard of a magical weapon of great power, some call it the ebony blade. 
Amongst the frogloks there can be found a minotaur who wields this sword of might. If you are a ranger and could provide me with this sword, I would gladly 
exchange it with my own meager weapon. If you prefer, you may attempt to [acquire some information] for us instead.'</P>

<P>You say, 'I would prefer to acquire some information.'<BR>
Morin Shadowbane says 'Your tracking skills are invaluable to our cause, brave Crydee. Our scouts have reported sightings of a ghoul messenger. They have 
spotted him traveling between Kithicor and an undead camp in the Plains of Karana. They have attempted to track the monster and obtain any strategic 
documentation he may be carrying. Perhaps you can succeed where others have failed. Perhaps you may even earn my personal short sword.'</P>

<P>At this point you will want to head to West Karana. The Ghoul Messanger will show up in the hills around the Undead Ruins. Track him down and kill him 
to get <A href="javascript:popupInventory('a_strategic_map_of_kithicor')">A strategic map of Kithicor</A>, then return to Morin Shadowbane in Kithicor 
Forest.</P>

<P>*Give A strategic map of Kithicor to Morin Shadowbane.*<BR>
Morin Shadowbane says 'Excellent work, Crydee!! It is obvious that you are a highly skilled tracker and warrior. Accept this reward, my personal sword which 
has served me well in countless battles. Perhaps you are willing to perform [another service] on our behalf?'</P>

<HR>

<P><A href="javascript:popupInventory('orc_impaler')"><B>Orc Impaler</B></A></P>

<P>At this point, the dialogue leads into the quest for Orc Impaler.</P>

<P>You say, 'I will perform another service'<BR>
Morin Shadowbane says 'Very well then, your help will bring us closer to solving the mystery of Kithicor! Find Bryn Fynndel in the Lesser Faydark and tell him 
Morin sent you. His band of elven warriors are observing the activities of the Crushbone orcs and Mistmoore dark elves. Perhaps you can help them shed 
some light on our plight.'</P>

<P>Everything from this point onward takes place in Lesser Faydark until you go see Morin Shadowbane again. Bryn Fynndel can be found at the ranger camp 
in Lesser Faydark. He does not respond when hailed.</P>

<P>You say, 'Morin sent me.'<BR>
Bryn Fynndel says 'Morin Shadowbane, the great ranger, sent you to assist us? A strong ranger you must be if he has sent you personally. There is a great 
evil stalking the land, and it has spread its tendrils into Kithicor Forest. We believe the [shadowed men] are involved with this, somehow.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what shadowed men?'
Bryn Fynndel says 'The shadowed men have recently begun to appear, with vile purposes unknown to us. Their leader wanders these woods with a 
contingent of guards. Bring us his code book, and we may learn more of their plans.'</P>

<P>The Shadowman Leader spawns at the north end of the zone around POS 1800, NEG 400. Either him or his place holder will spawn every 22 minutes. 
While the place holder will always be holding something, the Shadowed Leader will be just a floating name. The only real difficulty here is that the brownie 
scouts will path directly though this area thus making the camp especially dangerous for anyone trying to do the quest at an appropriate level to use it. The 
brownie scouts will not agro though if in wolf form. When you finally do get the Shadowman Leader to spawn and kill him, he will drop a Shadowed Code 
Book.</P>

<P>*Give the Shadowed Code Book to Bryn Fynndel.*<BR>
Bryn Fynndel says 'Excellent work, Crydee! According to these codes, it seems the ghoul boss has been alerted to our probes now that his messenger is 
missing. We have a scout, Glidara Myllar, who may be in danger. Give her this note as soon as you can, she is in grave danger!'</P>

<P>Bryn Fynndel gives you the <A href="javascript:popupInventory('warning_to_glidara')">Warning to Glidara</A>.</P>

<P>Glidara Myllar is not far from the Undead Ruins in Lesser Faydark. She also does not respond if hailed.</P>

<P>*Give Warning to Glidara to Glidara Myllar.*<BR>
Glidara Myllar says 'So the ghoul boss knows of our inquiries? I fear that villain not! In fact, we must find out how much information he has received. Invade 
the undead ruins nearby and retrieve his log. Take this ring.. it will protect you from his spells. Return my ring with his log book and we will hopefully crack 
the mystery of Kithicor.'</P>

<P>Glidara Myllar gives you the Glidara's Ring.</P>

<P>You will now want to head to the undead ruins in Lesser Faydark. Three undead will spawn here any the Ghoul Boss can spawn at any spot. Kill 
everything you see, and he will eventually spawn. Kill the Ghoul Boss to get the 
<A href="javascript:popupInventory('ghoul_boss_log_book')">Ghoul Boss Log Book</A>.</P>

<P>*Give Glidara's Ring and Ghoul Boss Log Book to Glidara Myllar.*<BR>
Glidara Myllar says 'Daring work, Crydee. I've imprinted my seal on this log so that only Morin may open it. Deliver the log to Morin.'</P>

<P>Glidara Myllar gives you the Sealed Ghoul Boss Log Book.</P>

<P>You will now return to Kithikor Forest to see Morin Shadowbane again.</P>

<P>*Give Sealed Ghoul Boss Log Book to Morin Shadowbane.*<BR>
Morin Shadowbane says 'We meet again, Crydee. The ghoul boss' log reveals much of the machinations of our dark oppressors, but not enough. Deliver these 
orders to Bryn in Lesser Faydark, and he will provide you with another weapon to aid in our defense of Kithicor.'</P>

<P>Morin Shadowbane gives you the <A href="javascript:popupInventory('orders_for_bryn')">Orders for Bryn</A>.</P>

<P>Return to the ranger camp in Lesser Faydark.</P>

<P>*Gives Orders for Bryn to Bryn Fynndel.*<BR>
Bryn Fynndel says 'The vile ghoul boss has been defeated! My new orders state to arm you with our finest weaponry. Take this, the mighty orc impaler. 
Safe journeys, brave adventurer.'</P>

<P>Bryn Fynddel gives you Orc Impaler.</P>
