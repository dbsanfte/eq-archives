<P>11-26-2004: My latest Shockwave movie "The Bells are Ringing" is now online in the gallery section. ^^</P>

<P>11-24-2004: A bunch of updates have gone on during the last few weeks. I just had not updated this page. Check back after Thanksgiving as I will be uploading a 
Christmas movie very soon.</P>

<P>11-11-2004: Made some updates to the quest section. Added Riding the Clouds [Genkai 4] plus made updates to the dragoon job and bard artifact quests.</P>

<P>11-03-2004: Yes, I've been a bit lax on updating lately. Made a bunch of changes over the last few weeks and finally got around to uploading them.</P>

<P>09-26-2004: More quests added... Healing the Land and Tiger's Teeth.</P>

<P>09-24-2004: It's been a while since I did an update... July updates were removed as well as the element key on this page. I've finally gotten around to adding San d'Oria 
Missions, which covers from 1.1 to 5.1 at the moment. I also have completed several more quests, which will be added in a day or two.</P>

<P>08-11-2004: I broke down the "bards" section as it was getting a bit too generalized. Songs and spells were moved to the "magic" section, and equipment to "equipment." 
Everything else was sent to "extras" which is just my general catch-all area. Information "guilds" section was a bit too space to warrant it having its own area, so this area 
was removed and everything was relocated to extras. Oh, I've also added some new stuff to the magic and equipment areas. =)</P>

<P>08-08-2004: Minor update today, just a few more artifact armor pictures, added Mean Machine Quest and some more subjob spells in the Bard section... was up late getting 
the white mage job up to L25 or would probably be more.</P>

<P>08-07-2004: Added "Trouble at the Sluice" to the quest area under North San d'Oria.  I've also updated the header graphics on the site to fit better with the modified color 
scheme.</P>

<P>08-03-2004: Added "The Rumor" to the questing area. This appears in the newly added subarea for Bostaunieux Oubliette quests as well as to the existing page for 
spell-related quests.</P>

<P>08-02-2004: <A HREF="/gallery/event-summerfest2004.html"> Goldfish Scooping</A> appeared a few days ago. New screen shots have been added for Gusgen Mines, 
Rampaging Ram, the Summerfest event and some artifcat armor. I also saw Jolly Green yesterday, but forgot to take a screen shot. =( It looks just like a Goobbue though [see 
the misc gallery if you don't know what a Goobbue looks like.] Some other guy in the area didn't approve of my group farming techniques... <I>Hey, I'm a bard. You actually 
expect me to solo this stuff????</I> There was also a ballisa going on in the area: San d'Oria [winner] versus Windurst. I've also updated the quest section to include Ayame and 
Kaede [Ninja Job Quest] and Only The Best, which is a nice quest to earn fame in San d'Oria, Bastok and Jeuno all at the same time.</P>
