<P>Janurary 25, 2002: Site Changes<BR>
I made a lot of changes to the gallery area, which has a bunch of new pictures as well. FAQs are now all on the same page in the downloads 
section, and I've also added a section for user interfaces where you can get a small preview of the NWN-style UI I am working on.</P>

<P>December 17, 2002: Gallery Update<BR>
Many more new gallery images have been added. I've added a section for various random encounters and added a picture of Rallos Zek 
the Warlord. No faq in progress at the moment, but I will probably start another one soon.</P>

<P>November 28, 2002: Gallery Update<BR>
I've uploaded the noteworthy mobs and epic encounters galleries today. I also added a picture of Saryrn to the gods page. A few more 
dragons were added. I'm running behind on adding epic weapons, so the new epics page is only showing completely new epics and not 
people who I just have a new picture of. Plane of Sky quests faq is ready to go, but don't have time to add it... I'll get to that with the 
next update.</P>
