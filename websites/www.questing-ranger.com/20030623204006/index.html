<P>June 21, 2003: Baking and a New Quest<BR>
I've uploaded my preliminary work on two things that I am working on. One is the Baking section, which just has a few recipes at the 
moment. The other is some notes for the Rallic Pack Quest, which appears in the FAQ section. I've also replaced the placeholder image 
for the Misty Thicket. [I also have an image ready for Halas, should I take pictures the next time I am in that area. I have a lot of stuff 
on the way, including a bunch of images from inside the Plane of Time (both A and B.)</P>

<P>June 19, 2003: Lore - Planes of Power<BR>
I've added a new section under resources called "Lore" which documents background stories and histories that pertain to the game. While 
quests can be considered to be part of the expanding lore, this section covers those stories that are not covered by other parts of the 
site.</P>

<P>May 25, 2003: Plane of Time and Sleeper's Tomb!<BR>
I've uploaded a ton of new epic shots over the last month. Over the last few days, I've completely redone the guides in the resources 
section. All documents are viewable from the site in non-PDF format. Some have downloads in addition to the PDF faqs, such as checklists 
which should hopefully be printer friendly. I've also added new gallery sections covering the Plane of Time and Sleeper's Tomb.</P>

<P>April 22, 2003: More Gallery Updates...<BR>
Most of the gallery areas are almost up to date, with a few more placeholder images removed. I had a long day at work today, so didn't 
get them all uploaded. I expect to have all the world galleries except for Planes and Broken Skull Rock up to date by the end of the 
week.</P>

<P>April 15, 2003: The Rathe Revealed!<BR>
<A href="javascript:copyCat('rathe')"><IMG SRC="/images/gallery/worlds-planes/plane-earth/earth-rathe.gif" ALT="Rathe Council" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="75" BORDER="1" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>
I've updated the galleries again. The Luclin gallery no longer has any placeholder images. I have also updated the Velious gallery to remove 
some of the placeholders, but a few still remain. I have also added a bunch of non-epic weapons in the Other Rewards.<BR>
I have also seen The Rathe Council for the first time today and got some pictures. One has been uploaded to the site so far for viewing. 
I may upload some more later.</P>

<P>Some documents on this site are in Adobe Acrobat 5.0 format.<BR>
