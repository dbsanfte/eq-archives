<P>May 25, 2003: Plane of Time and Sleeper's Tomb!<BR>
I've uploaded a ton of new epic shots over the last month. Over the last few days, I've completely redone the guides in the resources 
section. All documents are viewable from the site in non-PDF format. Some have downloads in addition to the PDF faqs, such as checklists 
which should hopefully be printer friendly. I've also added new gallery sections covering the Plane of Time and Sleeper's Tomb.</P>

<P>April 22, 2003: More Gallery Updates...<BR>
Most of the gallery areas are almost up to date, with a few more placeholder images removed. I had a long day at work today, so didn't 
get them all uploaded. I expect to have all the world galleries except for Planes and Broken Skull Rock up to date by the end of the 
week.</P>

<P>April 15, 2003: The Rathe Revealed!<BR>
<A href="javascript:copyCat('rathe')"><IMG SRC="/images/gallery/worlds-planes/plane-earth/earth-rathe.gif" ALT="Rathe Council" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="75" BORDER="1" ALIGN="LEFT"></A>
I've updated the galleries again. The Luclin gallery no longer has any placeholder images. I have also updated the Velious gallery to remove 
some of the placeholders, but a few still remain. I have also added a bunch of non-epic weapons in the Other Rewards.<BR>
I have also seen The Rathe Council for the first time today and got some pictures. One has been uploaded to the site so far for viewing. 
I may upload some more later.</P>

<P>April 4, 2003: All Galleries Online... Technically<BR>
The improved Luclin gallery is online. Many placeholder images still remain, which I plan to replace over the weekend. I still have a lot of 
new screen shots to add. I also plan to upgrade the gallery in my profile area to the new style. Non-gallery updates will be worked on soon, 
after all the placeholder images are replaced and I am all caught up.</P>

<P>April 2, 2003: Odus and Velious Galleries Online<BR>
I added the Odus gallery a few days ago and the Velious gallery today. As before, placeholder images are being used with the Velious 
gallery until I have time to run around and get proper screen shots for the different zones. I also have a lot more new screen shots to 
processes afterwards then will begin work on some projects that don't relate to the galleries. I moved the link to get the Acrobat Reader, 
if you don't have it, to the bottom of this page. I found that it was causing problems accessing the contact area when an internet 
connection decided to run slow. Lots to do and more on the way!</P>

<P>Some documents on this site are in Adobe Acrobat 5.0 format.<BR>
