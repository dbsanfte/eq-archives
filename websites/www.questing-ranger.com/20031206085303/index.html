<P>November 22, 2003: Gallery Update - Faydwer<BR>
The Faydwer gallery is back online! I am going to next concentrate on getting a bunch of inventory screen shots for finished backing 
recipes added as it really isn't fun to let them pile up too much. Once this batch is done, I'll start working on the Antonica gallery as well 
as adding more images to the half elf fashion table.</P>

<P>November 21, 2003: Resources Update - Half Elf Fashion Table<BR>
I reworked the half elf fashion table and gave it its own option on the drop down menu. The screen shot for Petrified Bark Leggings was 
removed as it didn't fit the format that I intended. However I added a bunch of full sets of ranger armor. Since I was able to obtain a 
near complete set of Engraved Royal Velium Armor, I was able to start work on Velious-style plate armor and added Rizlona's Fiery Armor 
as well. The Faydark gallery is almost ready. I've finished my reevaluation of all my old screen shots and am almost done with the LDON 
ones. I expect this to be back online sometime tomorrow, time permitting.</P>

<P>November 20, 2003: Gallery Update - Planes<BR>
The gallery covering planar zones has been reuploaded. For space purposes, I have cut all non-named mobs and miscellaneous zone 
pictures. Some lesser named mobs have been cut as well in some cases. I've also started adding inventory screen shots for finished baked 
items. Several were added yesterday, and I took some more screen shots for this project today. I'm also reworking the half elf fashion table 
a bit, and plan to add it to the main drop down menu under resources during the next update. The Faydark gallery is also being worked on 
at the moment.</P>

<P>November 17, 2003: General Update Complete<BR>
The site is back online for the most part. Galleries are undergoing evaluation at the moment but will be back shortly. I plan to evaluate 
the section covering planes first as they were taking up the most space. Antonica and Faydark will come next due to containing the Lost 
Dungeons of Norrath zones. Oddly enough while uploading today, I ran into the Shadowed Leader so will be adding the Orc Impaler quest to 
the site after the gallery is back online.</P>
