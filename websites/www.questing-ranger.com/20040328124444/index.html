<P>March 8, 2004: The Binden Concerrentia FAQ [EQ]<BR>
My FAQ for The Binden Concerrentia is finally nearing completion. The main thing which caused it to take so long was that I didn't get to it 
right away after I did the quest thus needed to dig through my log files to obtain the quest dialogue. With most of this out of the way, the 
FAQ is about 2/3 of the done.</P>

<P>March 4, 2004: Let's Do the Time Warp!<BR>
Just noticed that the year part of all my updates for this year was set to 2003... oops. This was fixed. Anyway, the Planes of Power 
Progression FAQ is completed and ready for download.</P>

<P>Feburary 19, 2004: Update #2<BR>
I had time to do another update, so added two more faqs: EverQuest [Brewing] and Skies of Arcadia Legends [Swashbuckling.] 

<P>Feburary 19, 2004: Resources Update<BR>
Another revamp done of the resources area. This one cuts out all the unneccsary parts of the resources area. Everything was redone as 
FAQ documents, available in either html or txt format. A few items work better as spreadsheets, thus are available as MS Excel documents 
as well as html.</P>

<P>Feburary 1, 2004: Skies<BR>
Another update on the Skies of Arcadia faq. This time up through completing Galcia.</P>

<P>January: 26, 2004: Skies of Arcadia Legends<BR>
I'm just at the point where Vyse meets Gilder on replaying this game and have updated the faq to be good through to this point.</P>

<P>January 20, 2004: A few updates<BR>
The half elf fashion table has been renamed to the "Equipment RGB Colors" 

<P>January 19, 2004: Revised Site Uploaded<BR>
The gallery was changed... again, as well as some other areas this time as well. I will be back to regular updates
