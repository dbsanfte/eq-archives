<P><B>Windurst Woods Quests</B></P>

<P><B>Creepy Crawlies</B><BR>
Client: Illu Bohjaa<BR>
Location: Dhalmel Farm [H-6]<BR>
Items: 3 Crawler Calculi or 3 Silk Thread<BR>
Reward: 600G<BR>
Title: Crawler Culler</P>

<P>If you are killing the crawlers themselves as opposed to just buying the crawler calculi at the auction house, I recommend turning in the calculi to get the fame but sell the 
silk at the auction house as it goes for way too much to be used as a quest turn in.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Paying Lip Service</B><BR>
Client: Tapoh Lihzeh<BR>
Location: Apothecary [I-8]<BR>
Items: 3 Beehive Chips or 2 Remi Shells<BR>
Reward: 150G or 200G</P>

<P>This quest gets pointed out to me a lot as if I didn't know about it. However I just do not think the reward is worth the effort. I'm not sure about Remi Shells, but Beehive 
Chips go for a lot at the auction house on my server... especially when sold by the stack. Much like the Silk Thread for the Creepy Crawlies quest, you are better off selling 
Beehive Chips than using them for turn-ins.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>The All New C-2000</B><BR>
Client: Kopuro-Popuro<BR>
Location: Manustery [H-10]<BR>
Items: Insect Wing, Rabbit Hide, Two-Leaf Mandragora Bud<BR>
Reward: 200G<BR>
Title: Cardian Tutor</P>

<P>The two-leaf mandragora bud is a rare/ex item so you will need to specifically camp for it. The rabbit hide and insect wing drop more commonly off their respective mobs, but 
can also be purchased from the auction house.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>The Fanged One</B><BR>
Client: Perih Vashai<BR>
Location: Vashai's Residence [K-7]<BR>
Requirements: Level 30+<BR>
Items: Old Tiger Fang<BR>
Reward: Ranger's Necklace, Ranger Job<BR>
Title: The Fanged One</P>

<P>For this quest, you need to journey to the cave in the Sauromugue Champaign at [L-10]. If you enter the zone from Meriphataud Montains, as if coming from Windurst, 
follow the wall to your right until you reach a point that will allow you to go to the upper level area then head to the cave at [L-10]. Also the best way to do this part of the 
quest is to come here by chocobo as the tigers in and around the cave will not agro you will you are riding one. The chocobo will enter this cave, so take it to the back to 
where there is a tiger skeleton on the ground.</P>

<P>At this point, you will want to wait for all the tigers to leave then get off the chocobo. You may want to check the bones now to see if you can get the Old Tiger Fang. If 
not, just invis yourself and wait for the named tiger to die naturally. When you do get the fang, invis yourself and leave the cave.</P>
