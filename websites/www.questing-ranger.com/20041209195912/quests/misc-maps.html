clay. The monunments are listed and covered in chronological order, but you can find them in any order. Also after you have turned in 15 of the 17 monuments, you will

<P>South Gustenberg [K-10]<BR>
This one is easy to find. Just head to the area around the lighthouse and this monument will be in plain view along the edge of the cliff.</P>

<P>North Gustenberg [F-7]<BR>
For this one you need to actually head to South Gustenberg then go to Dangruf Wadi. Once in here head towards the upper right and you'll find a guiser. Stand on the guiser at 
the spot where water comes out and it will shoot up to the higher ledge. You may need invisibility at this point as the mobs are higher level in the next part and will still agro at 
Level 30. Continue heading towads the upper-right and you'll come to another guiser. Again stand on it to get shot up to the higher ledge. This higher ledge leads to a secret 
area that will take you to North Gustenberg. Once in North Gustenberg, you will be in the area below the waterfall. Go straight ahead then cross the bridge to get to the left 
side of the river. [There are goblins here as well that may agro.] When you get to the waterfall, enter the cave behind it to find the Stone Monument.</P>

<P>Konschtat Highlands [G-7]<BR>
Look for a cave along the North side of the mountains.</P>

<P>East Ronfaure [G-11]<BR>
This one is not far from King Ranperre's Tomb. From here, head to G-11 and you will find it against the far wall of this area.</P>

<P>Junger Forest [H-12]<BR>
Head to the area of H-12 inside Jugner Forest and you should see a cave, which has the stone monument inside. While I did read of many warnings about tigers being in this 
area thus creating a danger, I did not see a single one anywhere near the cave. I did however see someone healing in this area that most likely was killing them.</P>

<P>Rolanberry Fields [K-11]<BR>
For this one, you'll want to ride a chocobo to get the the monument. Just head towards K-11 and when you get to the white barrier, you can cross it from the left side [when 
entering.] Along the far back wall, you'll find the monument. To get out, you'll want to use invisibility and sneak unless at a high level. Just cross back over the barrier from the 
same side then work you way back to the road. [Alternately, you can use an instant warp scroll to get out.]</P>

<P>West Ronfaure [I-10]<BR>
This one is in a corner of one of the building ruins in this area.</P>

<P>Valkurm Dunes [E-9]<BR>
The mounment is in a cave along the beach.</P>

<P>Pashhow Marshlands [F-6]<BR>
Unless you are of a high enough level that the malboros in this zone will not attack you, you should ride a chocobo to get to this monument. If you look at the [F-6] are on the 
map, there is a small dead-end. The stone monument is here, but it is being guarded by a malboro. Wait until the malboro is looking away then dismount from the chocobo at 
the monument. You will need to use sneak to get out safely. However should you be detected anyway, gravity works well on slowing it down enough for you to get away to 
safely. Other than this one mob, most others are easy enough to avoid getting agro from by not getting to close to them.</P>

<P>La Theine Plateau [J-7]<BR>
For this one, you need to go into Ordelle's Caves. Once inside, take the passageway to the left that leads to a room full of fungars. There will be two more passage ways here. 
One leads too the pool room and the other back out to La Theine Plateau. You'll want to take the one leading back out to La Theine. You will now find yourself in another one of 
the pits in the zone. The Stone Monument is easy to find from here. Just keep running straight ahead and eventually you will come to J-7 where it is located.</P>

<P>Meriphataud Mountains [J-10]<BR>
This one is fairly easy to locate as it is out in the open. The only noteworthy thing is that it is in the lower section and there are a bunch of raptors in the area.</P>

<P>Tahrongi Canyon [E-5]<BR>
Look for a cave along the edge of the wall in this area.</P>

<P>West Sarutabaruta [G-9]<BR>
This one can be found on the raised cliff area to the west of Windurst. You'll find the slop leading upwards towards the north side of the cliff. Once you have found it, just follow 
the wall until you come to the Stone Monument.</P>

<P>East Sarutabaruta [K-6]<BR>
Another that is extremely easy. Just head to K-6, and the Stone Monument can be found near where the river ends.</P>

<P>Buburimu Peninsula [J-5]<BR>
This one is along the boundry wall for the area and out in the open so shouldn't be too much trouble to find.</P>
