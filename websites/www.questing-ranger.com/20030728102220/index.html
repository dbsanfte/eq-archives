<P>July 26, 2003: Profile Update<BR>
I just finished an update of the equipment section in my profile area.</P>

<P>July 15, 2003: Pottery 199<BR>
I've been working hard on tradeskills lately. Brewing and Jewel Craft are both over 220, with Pottery rapidly approaching this range. Once this 
is done, I'll get fletching up to 240+ while working on both Smithing and Tailoring. New Tanaan Crafting Mastery is maxed out. As for the site, 
I've been working on some backend stuff, mostly cleaning up the log file archives.</P>

<P>July 7, 2003: Plane of Time<BR>
I added a bunch of pictures from the Plane of Time yesterday. Other recent additions included Hates Fury (Ykesha) and Veeshan's Peak 
(Kunark.) My next project will be to finish up the Neverwinter Nights based spell icons.</P>

<P>July 3, 2003: Uploading Issue Resolved<BR>
I completely reuploaded all gallery images in the epic section and double-checked to make sure that everything went through this time.</P>

<P>July 3, 2003: Uploading Issue Discovered!<BR>
Aftering doing some checks on the gallery, I noticed that some files that were reuploaded during the cleanup did not upload correctly. This 
will be corrected today starting around 6:30pm PST. To correct this, I plan to remove all epic gallery images and reupload all a few at a time 
to ensure that they are all working correctly. While I plan to finish this today, it is not going to leave me time for other updates to 
today.</P>

<P>July 1, 2003: Gallery Update<BR>
This update consisted of two things. First, I removed a lot of epic weapon images. Mostly those of random people that I never grouped 
with, talked to, raided with or shared a guild tag with. If the screen shot of someone didn't fall into one of those categories, I took it 
down. This was mostly due to space issues as it was getting to the point where I was going to be looking at a cost increase in order to 
perform additional updates. Now that this has been completed, I did add one new epic weapon picture plus added some images of the 
four shields from the elemental gods to the other rewards section, even though they are not real rewards. I have a lot of images on the 
way that I am getting ready at the moment, including images from Hates Fury and the Plane of Time.</P>
