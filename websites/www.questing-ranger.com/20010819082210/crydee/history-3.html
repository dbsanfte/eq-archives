<P CLASS="header2">About Crydee: Background History</P>

<P CLASS="text">Until the day when both guilds found out what I was doing...<BR>
Well actually, I'm skipping ahead a bit. See one day I was wandering about the forest, not really paying attention to where I was going, and I got 
into trouble. Bad trouble. Surrounded by a bunch of orcs trouble. I was sure I was going to die, but I called out for help anyway. I great fighter 
came to my rescue and saved me. He fought with both magic and physical attacks, using two swords even. None of this silly bash with our 
shields nonsense. This was the first time I saw a ranger. I had heard of them, but I had only known of them as being mysterious woodsmen.</P>

<P CLASS="text">I knew then that I wanted to be a ranger…<BR>
Especially when I found out that ranger just knew what was around him. He called it tracking. The ranger tested me some as tracking was innate 
to all rangers from the day of their birth. He'd hide someplace and have me find him or he'd tell me to find a particular type of creature in the 
forest. I responded quickly and correctly each time. The ranger took be back to Kelethin to meet with Maesyn Trueshot, guild master of the 
rangers. Unfortunately, the Heartwood Master and Lord Jyteel were there as well, along with my teachers from both guilds. I had been gone so 
long that both guild leaders when to him for help finding a missing student.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Ok, now I’m in trouble…<BR>
Lord Jyteel insisted that I give up the nature nonsense and return with him to his guild. The Heartwood Master wanted me to forget about sword 
fighting. Both were confused by my innate tracking ability, yet were both firm that I shouldn’t be able to do that. My teachers from each guild 
blamed the other for the things that they though I should be able to do, yet couldn’t. Maesyn Trueshot looked at my serenely and asked which 
of the two guilds I wanted. I had to pick one or the other, but could not have both. I didn’t want to be a paladin nor a druid. When my teachers 
started pulling at me, I ran off into the forests of Greater Faydark vowing not to return until they came to their sense.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Three days…<BR>
I spent three days in the forests, living off of what little food and water I brought with me. The wolves of the forest continued to protect me 
from the orcs, for which I am very greatful. On the third day, Maesyn Trueshot came looking for me. I lead him on a five-hour chase through the 
forest, but eventually he tracked me down when I grew weary. Instead of sending me back to the paladins or the druids, he took me into his 
guild. The other two guilds protested it at first, but when they saw that I was where I should be they accepted the decision that was made. I 
am grateful for the time I spent with them. If anything, it has taught me to appreciate those that choose to walk other paths because in the 
end, we are all Tunare's children.</P>
