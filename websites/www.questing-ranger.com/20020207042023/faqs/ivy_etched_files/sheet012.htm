<P><B>Possible Faction Issues</B></P>

<P><B>Brownie</B><BR>
Wolf Form will cause the wandering Brownie Scouts in Lesser Faydark to not argo on you. This is helpful for when hunting down Thistle 
Underbrush.</P>

<P><B>Frogloks of Guk</B><BR>
Although this faction is not needed for any of these quests, you can get to Slaythe the Slayer a lot easier if you do not kill Frogloks in Upper 
Guk on your way to him. Keep in mind that undead frogs in Lower Guk will definately argo on you regardless and so will minotaurs. After you 
kill Slaythe the Slayer, you will have a harder time getting out of Guk so be prepared for when you are ready to leave Guk.</P>

<P><B>Lord Searfire, Temple of Solusek Ro</B><BR>
Lord Searfire is an NPC that must be talked to for the Ivy Etched Boots quest. There are four ways you can gain faction with him:<UL>
	<LI>Kill many Shadowed Men</LI>
	<LI>Give 30 GP at a time to Rathmana Allin in South Ro</LI>
	<LI>Give 4 Cutthroat Insignia Rings to Ortallius in South Ro</LI>
	<LI>Go to the graveyard in Mistmoore Castle, take the flower of the coffin and give it to the named Shadowed Man behund the crypt</LI>
</UL></P>

<P><B>Priestess Ghalea, Kaladim</B><BR>
Priestess Ghalea is another NPC that must be talked to for the Ivy Etched Boots quest. To gain faction with her, do the bone chip quest that 
Gunlok Jure in the Kaladim Paladin guild gives out. He wants four bone chips at a time in exchange for the needed faction.</P>
