<P><B>Key of Veeshan [Veeshan's Peak Key] FAQ</B><BR>
by Crydee Ossiriand, Torvonnilous Server<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.questing-ranger.com">http://www.questing-ranger.com</A><BR>
Version: 2004.06.01</P>

<P>If you are pursuing this quest, you most likely have the Trakanon Idol already. The quest for it is only included for completeness as it is required to 
obtain Trakanon's Tooth.</P>

<P>The three Medallion sub-quests may be completed in any order. It is not necessarily to have one medallion in order to complete another medallion's 
sub-quest. All medallion shards will be identically labeled as "Piece of a medallion." For this walkthrough, I am referring to all medallions by what they appear 
as when Identify is used on them.</P>

<P>One thing to keep in mind here that you are looking at very long camp times in most cases to obtain the Medallion Shards. My personal longest wait 
time was about five hours for the Blood Gil Marauder, but you can find yourself waiting eight or more hours in some cases. The pickup bags in Kaesora and 
Swamp of No Hope will respawn in a few hours.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Trakanon</B></P>

<P><I>To complete this part, first it is necessary to complete the quest for the Trakanon Idol to gain entry to Sebilis. The quest for this key is also given 
by Emperor Ganak in Trakanon's Teeth.</I></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail Emperor Ganak'<BR>
Emperor Ganak says 'Greetings..It has been long since I have been aware on this plane..Who are you and what do you want of I, Ganak, slayer of 
Jaled-Dar?</P>

<P>I think there should be more text in here, but I couldn't figure out the phases.</P>

<P>You say, 'what about the medallions'<BR>
Emperor Ganak says 'There were five different tribes of my people. The Kunzar, Kylong, Nathsar, Obulus, and Jarsath. Each of these tribes had a medallion 
that represented it. If you can return to me the Medallion of the Kunzar and Nathsar, I will give you the idol of Trakanon.'</P>

<P>The Medallions of Kunzar and Nathsar drop off the Froglok Foragers and Froglok Hunters in Trakanon's Teeth. Kill one of each to obtain both medallions. 
After doing so, return to Emperor Ganak and give him these to medallions to get the Trakanon Idol, which will allow you to enter Sebilis.</P>

<P><I>Once you have gained access to Sebilis, you will need to kill Trakanon deep in the lower level of this dungeon to get Trakanon's Tooth. This part used 
to be hard and required massive guild raids but as of this point, can be done with one group.</I></P>

<HR>

<P><B>Medallion of Jarsath</B></P>

<P>This sub-quest is given by Xiblin Fizzlebik in Timorous Deep. He can be found on Chessboard Island.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Xiblin Fizzlebik'<BR>
Xiblin Fizzlebik says 'Hello, Crydee! I am Xiblin Fizzlebik, renowned archeologist and historian of Ak'Anon. I'm currently in search of artifacts and relics on the 
Iksar [Jarsath tribe]. If you stumble upon anything, please bring it to me.</P>

<P>You say, 'What Jarsath tribe'<BR>
Xiblin Fizzlebik says 'About two thousand years ago, there were five different tribes of Iksar who dwelled on the continent of Kunark. One of these tribes was 
the Jarsath. They were a very primitive sort, proud and tribal, but also cannibalistic. Often, they went to war with the other tribes that co-existed with them, 
back then. The ruins found on this island were of structures created by the Jarsath. I've been excavating for quite some time now, but haven't been able to 
find anything of significance.</P>

<P><I>There may be more dialogue, but I didn't get anything else out of him.</I></P>

<P>Top Shard of the Jarsath Medallion<BR>
This piece is a ground spawn in the Swamp of No Hope. Just head to POS 52, POS 2935 and pickup the "bag" that is on the ground. If the bag is not there, 
someone probably picked it up recently. You can either wait for it to respawn or try again later.</P>

<P>Middle Shard of the Jarsath Medallion<BR>
This piece is dropped by the Ancient Jarsath in Firiona Vie. The Ancient Jarsath spawns around the Drolvarg building towards the North East part of the zone. 
It is rumoured to have a placeholder, but this is unconfirmed. In any case, the Ancient Jarsath will wander, which makes it one of the harder mobs for 
non-trackers. This is a melee only mob. For a L60, the Ancient Jarsath will /CON light blue and be easy to solo. I had a few snares resisted, but overall magic 
resistance seems low. You can avoid adds by pulling it to one of the zones to the Swamp of No Hope. If you pickup adds, just snare or root them and 
continue to pull the Ancient Jarsath away to near the zone.</P>

<P>Bottom Shard of the Jarsath Medallion:<BR>
This piece is dropped by the Blood Gill Marauder in the Lake of Ill Omen. Head to POS 52, NEG 2000 underwater and you will find yourself at a doorway. The 
Blood Gil Maraurder will spawn in front of the doorway. It has no placeholders, but a perminate Enduring Breath item is recommended as you will most likely 
have to wait a long time. This is a melee only mob. For a L60, the Blood Gill Marauder will /CON light blue and be easy to solo. I had no resists to either snare 
or calcification. The only possible complication here is having low stamina due to being underwater. If the Blood Gil Maraurder is not already up, I recommend 
killing all the other goblins around where it spawns so as to not have to deal with adds. I doubt they would make the fight harder, just more of an annoyance 
factor.</P>

<P>Once you have all three shards, return to the Chessboard Island in Timorous Deep.</P>

<P>*Give Xiblin Fizzlebik the Top, Middle and Bottom Shards for the Jarsath Medallion.*<BR>
Xiblin Fizzlebik tinkers with the three pieces and snaps the pieces together. 'Wow.. You've done it.. but I suddenly feel very.. strange.. This medallion is 
cursed! Here, you take it!</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Medallion of Obulus</B></P>

<P><I>This sub-quest is given by Slixin Klex at NEG 680, NEG 1130 in Burning Woods. He will be in one of the craters.</I></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Slixin Klex'<BR>
Slixin Klex says 'So long ago... The burning of our land?</P>

<P>You say, 'What burning of our land?'<BR>
Slixin Klex says 'Fiery death from the sky. Rock and fire burning our lands. Death and destruction splintering our tribe. Once, strong we were, but the fiery 
rocks from the sky crushed our proud cities and weakened our tribe.</P>

<P>You say, 'What tribe?'<BR>
Slixin Klex says 'Obulus was our people. The hills and trees were our lands. We tamed the dark and wilds and bent the forests to our needs. But all is gone, 
all our people, all our works, even the medallion that was the symbol of our power.</P>

<P>You say, 'What medallion?'<BR>
Slixin Klex says 'Medallion of the Obulus. Symbol of our proud people. Broken into pieces long lost to the dark forests now. I know where they are now but I 
am no longer flesh. If I were, I would find them and bring them back together.</P>

<P>Top Shard of the Obulus Medallion:<BR>
You will first need a Burnished Wooden Stave, which drops off of random Sarnaks in Chardok. This is a tradeable item. Afterwards you will need to go to 
Ssolet Dnaas in Warslik Woods. I was kill on sight with him, and he sees through invisibility. Having an enchanter charm him is supposed to work, but I used 
Superior Camoflage then Sneaked to make him indifferent. After Ssolet Dnaas is indiferent to you, give him the Burnished Wooden Stave. <I>Ssolet Dnaas 
says 'Sssss. Thisss is what I need. You have my thanksss. Please, take thiss. I know not what it iss for but maybe you will find a ussse for it.</I> You then 
receive the Top Shard of the Obulus Medallion.</P>

<P>Middle Shard of the Obulus Medallion:<BR>
This piece is dropped by the Rotting Skeleton in The Dreadlands. Head to 2246, NEG 5133 towards the North-East end of the zone. The Rotting Skeleton 
spawns at this location, with a Greater Plaguebone as the placeholder. This is a melee only mob. For a L60, the Rotting Skeleton will /CON light blue and be 
easy to solo. I had no resists to either snare or calcification.</P>

<P>Bottom Shard of the Obulus Medallion:<BR>
This piece is dropped by the Pained Soul in Trakanon's Teeth. Head to NEG 1835, NEG 4368 near Sebilis. The Pained Soul spawns at this location, with a 
Spectral Keeper as the placerholder. There are other Spectral Keepers in the zone, but this mob does not wander. Both the Pained Soul and the Spectral 
Keeper are caster mobs. Some of the placerholders /CONed light blue in addition to the Pained Soul. I had no resists to either snare or calcification. The 
Pained Soul can hit anywhere from 40 to 100, so damage shields and chloroplast are recommended.</P>

<P>Once you have all three shards, return to Slixin Klex in Burning Woods.</P>

<P>*Give Slixin Klex the Top, Middle and Bottom Shards for the Obulus Medallion.*<BR>
Slixin Klex says 'Ssssss. I thought I would never see these. I never thought the symbol of our people would be made whole again. I feel no rest for my sssoul 
though. My torment still flows as freely as when my peoples first suffered fiery death. I need this not. It is useless to me. Here, you take it. Maybe you can 
find some good to do with it.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Medallion of Kylong</B></P>

<P><I>This sub-quest is given by Professor Akabo in Lake of Ill Omen.</I></P>

<P>You say, 'hail Professor Akabao'<BR>
Professor Akabao says 'Salutations traveler I dont get many visitors in these isolated regions. Have you come to learn of the ancient tribes of the Iksar?'</P>

<P>You say, 'I have come to learn of the ancient tribes of the iksar'<BR>
Professor Akabao says 'There were five tribes of Iksars that rose from the ashes of the Shissar Empire and founded their kingdoms on the continent of 
Kunark. Three of the tribes were extinguished many years later by the Kunzar tribe which is the tribe that the current Iksar are descendant from. I focus my 
studies on learning of the extinct tribe of Kylong.'</P>

<P>You say, 'What medallion'<BR>
Professor Akabao says 'I have been attempting to learn of the destinations of the three Kylong leaders that held the fragments of the medallion. I know only 
that they sought shelters to hide and continue the practice of their mystical arts In order to one day return their tribe to it's former glory. Their remains may 
exist beneath some of the fortresses that are centers of Iksar and Sarnak necromancy. I have seen indications that some of the tomes within those 
fortresses are in fact the very tomes once cherished by the Kylong. Should you manage to recover the broken pieces of the Medallion of Kylong bring them 
to me so that I may restore the ancient artifact.</P>

<P>Top Shard of the Kylong Medallion:<BR>
Niblek in Chardok will give you the Top Shard in exchange for a Black Sapphire and a Ruby. Black Sapphires most commonly drop in Sebilis. Rubies drop there 
as well, but can also be purchased from merchants. The best way to do this part is to have someone who is not KOS to Chardok turn the gems into Niblek for 
you then multiquest the final turn in to Professor Akabo.</P>

<P>Middle Shard of the Kylong Medallion:<BR>
This part is dropped by Verix Kyloxs remains in the basement of Karnor's Castle. This part is not soloable, so you will need a group. Fortunately though, the 
camp still gives experience at level 60.</P>

<P>Bottom Shard of the Kylong Medallion:<BR>
This part is a bag in the library area of Kaesora. Once you get to the library, you will find stairs leading upwards. The bag is in a corner on the second 
floor.</P>

<P>Once you have all three shards, give the three shards to Professor Akabo in Lake of Ill Omen to get the completed medallion.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Key of Veeshan</B></P>

<P>Go to Emperor Ganak in Trakanon's Teeth. Give him the Medallion of Jarsath, Medallion of Obulus, Medallion of Kylong and Trakanon's Tooth to receive the 
Key of Veeshan.</P>

<P>Emperor Ganak says, 'I must say, I though your flesh would be rotting from your bones alongside the remains of the ancient Sebilisians. I commend you 
on your victory over the poison dragon and thank yu for returning the ancient medallions of my people. I reward you with the key your seek. A place shall 
be prepared for your souls among the most honored of the dead. Soon you will be seeing the world through the shroud of death.'</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Faction</B></P>

<P><B>Emperor Ganak</B><BR>
The problem here isn't with Emperor Ganak himself, but that there are a bunch of undead mobs outside the building he is in that you will be KOS to. 
Invisibility Versus Undead [either by spell or potion] is recommended for reaching him safely.</P>

<P><B>Niblek</B><BR>
The easiest way to deal with Niblek if you are KOS to Chardok is to have someone else go in and do the turn in for you, then multiquest that piece with you 
afterwards.</P>

<P><B>Ssolet Dnaas</B><BR>
Most likely you will be KOS to Ssolet Dnaas. Either have an enchanter charm him or use sneak with invis/hide to turn this in.</P>
