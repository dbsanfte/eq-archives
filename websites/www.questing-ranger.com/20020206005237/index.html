<P CLASS="header2">Warder Petition</P>

<P CLASS="text"><I>Reprinted with consent from Aeril Crimsonhawk.</I></P>

<P CLASS="text">What's in a Name?<BR>
Assassin. Grandmaster. Sorcerer. High Priest. These are the coveted titles that let everyone in EQ know that you have fought the long fight, been in for the 
long haul. Title that Verant has reserved for players tenacious enough to play through 60 levels on one character, a feat that I'm sure no on will argue is worthy 
of some recognition anywhere you go. But it is ironic, in my opinion, that the same people who have granted these titles have also seen fit to devalue one of 
these titles in the most eronious way... by handing the title of a level 60 Ranger to a pet, one that may be summoned up by any Beastlord once he has past 
level 9. I think it is degrading and insulting to every Ranger that has managed to reach their 60th season, only to find a little kitty cat summoned up by "Joe 
the Beastlord" and is instantly named Joe's Warder.</P>

<P CLASS="text">Funk &amp; Wagnall's Dictionary defines Warder as: A keeper; guard; sentinel; watchman. Appropriate for either group, to be sure. But 
inappropriate to be used for both. I find it incredibly disheartening for all of us Rangers who have "get to level 60" on our Everquest life's goal list. I know 
everyone has one of those.... a list of all the things we want to do some day in Everquest. Mine is pretty long... but it includes getting a fletching skill above 
200 (mine hit 202 yesterday) and also includes getting my Ranger his epic weapons, a full set of Golden Leaf Armor (Skyshrine Quest armor), the Helm of the 
Tracker, and, I think most importantly, becoming the best Warder in all of Norrath, or at least the best on Veeshan server. Those are my goals. But hey, if I 
want a Warder, why not just make a Beast Lord? It'll be a lot quicker that way.........</P>

<P CLASS="text">I think everyone can agree on this point; I can't see a reason for the pet to not have a name that is unobtrusive to everyone. I certainly also 
wouldn't support the pet being named "Joe's Hierophant" or "Jack's Crusader" or "Jane's Warlord" Those are simply titles that I respect and would not submit to 
the sort of debasement that comes of having your title given to a kitten! This showing of the lack of either respect of thought on the part of Verant has me very 
dissappointed in Everquest: I feel like a child who just found out there's no Santa Claus. The solution that I propose is simple: the Beast Lord pet needs a new 
name. Something that suggests power and might, but in their own right. Some suggestions: Keeper, Watcher, Sentinel, Guard, Protector. Be creative and give 
the Beastlord class something of which they can be very proud, but not at the expense of the Ranger.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">January 23, 2002: Gallery In Progress</P>
<P CLASS="text">I'm in the process of reuploading the gallery. I am uploading the images in small batches, which makes it a lot easier for 
me to confirm that they were uploaded. I expect to get ten to twenty images added daily until the entire gallery is back online.<BR>
I also plan to get the lastest FAQ done, so that I can start working on the next one.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">January 19, 2002: Gallery In Progress</P>
<P CLASS="text">A minor coding delima was resently resolved and the gallery section will be reopening shortly.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">January 12, 2002: FAQ Update</P>
<P CLASS="text">The Ivy Etched armour quests FAQ is finally completed and a downloadable version is now available. The preview version of 
the Star of Eyes quest is also online. The gallery will start to go online again tomorrow, along with a finished version of the Star of Eyes 
quest and a preview version of another quest... I haven't decided yet as to which will be next. The profile area has also been updated 
again... more to come soon!</P>

<P CLASS="header1">January 7, 2002: FAQ Update</P>
<P CLASS="text">The final Ivy Etched armour quests FAQ should be up tomorrow. I ended up going on a raid today which kept me from 
finishing the update today. I am also currently working on the Veeshan's Peak Key FAQ and getting the gallery live again.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">January 7, 2002: FAQ Update</P>
<P CLASS="text">Gallery is still down. I've uploaded a preliminary FAQ for the Ivy Etched armour quests today. The final FAQ should be live 
tomorrow. I'm considering adding one more section to the site, and will start putting the gallery live again afterwards.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">December 29, 2001: Big Update!</P>
<P CLASS="text">The previous version of the site has been completely missing. While checking through my links to other sites today, I found 
that <A HREF="http://nx.sakura.ne.jp/~chizuya/" TARGET="_blank">Norrath Map Shop</A> isn't working.... =( This site easily had the best 
looking maps overall.</P>
