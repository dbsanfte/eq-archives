<P><B>Rune of Ivy [Top]</B></P>

<P>The Rune of Ivy [Top] is a random drop off the Deathly Ushers in Mistmoore Castle. These mobs are female Dark Elf Warriors in plate 
armour. I have seen them all over inside the Castle itself, but they are most commonly found in the jail and sometimes in the servants area. 
If you are of appropriate level to wear this armour, I recommend going with the jail. To get to the jail, go to the back right corner of the 
cemetery and there is a secret passage way where you are able to just walk through the wall. Once you get inside the jail, the cells 
themselves can be opened by clicking on the false door.</P>

<P>Keep in mind that some caster mobs and vampires will spawn in this are so resistance gear is highly recommended if you have it. The 
casters will nuke you down quick if you don't kill them fast. The vampires see through invisibility and will suck your stamina away.</P>

<P>There are two secret passage ways in this area. One leads down into a basement where mobs do not spawn. This is probably the safest 
place to go if your group needs to go into heavy downtime for meding.</P>

<P><B>Cyclops Charm</B></P>

<P>The Cyclops Charm drops off Tarskuk in Rathetear Mountains. As far as I can tell, he drops it every time or very close to that. I have 
never seen him not drop it, though I have heard it is possible, He spawns near the bandit camp on the hill in the area closest to the zone to 
Lake Rathe. I am not sure as to exactly what his placeholder is, so kill every lizardman, cyclops and bandit in this area to get him to show 
up.</P>
