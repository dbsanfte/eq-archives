<P><B>EXPANDED FINAL TURN IN</B></P>

<P>This part was added to help clear up any confusion that you may have with the final turn in portions of the quest. It is really easy to get 
excited here and hand in the wrong items. In all cases, I recommend keeping a General Inventory Slot free. This will ensure that you do not 
loose an item because all inventory slots have containers and the only one with a free spot is too small for the items you will be 
receiving.</P>

<P><B>Expanded Final Part 1: Kinlo Stongarm and Usbak the Old</B></P>
<P><OL>
	<LI>Check your inventory to make sure that you have an Ancient Longsword and the Hammer of the Ancients. If you are missing either 
		item, you cannot continue yet. See above in this FAQ for information on how to obtain these items. Information on obtaining the 
		Ancient Longsword is covered in Part 7 of the FAQ and the Hammer of the Ancients is covered in Part 8.</LI>
	<LI>Now that we are sure that you have everything you need to continue, give Kinlo Strongarm the Hammer of the Ancients.</LI>
	<LI>Usbak the Old will spawn now, and you will have a new item in your inventory called: Small bit of Mithril Ore. If the Small bit of Mithril 
		Ore is in your only free general slot, move it to a container.</LI>
	<LI>Now that we have ensured that you have a spot to receive the next item, give Usbak the Old your Ancient Longsword.</LI>
	<LI>Usbak the Old will despawn and you will have a new item in your inventory called: Refined Ancient Sword. If the Refined Ancient 
		Sword is in your only free general slot, move it to a container or equip it.</LI>
	<LI>Give Kinlo Strongarm the Small bit of Mithril Ore and you will get a second sword: Refined Mithril Blade.</LI>
	<LI>You are now ready to move on to the next part.</LI>
</OL></P>

<P><B>Expanded Final Part 2: Telin Darkforest and Faelin</B></P>
<P><OL>
	<LI>This is the part which is potentially the most confusing for people. You will have two swords: Refined Ancient Sword and Refined 
		Mithril Blade. If you do not have both of these, see Expanded Final Part 1 to obtain them.</LI>
	<LI>Check the two refined swords, one should say "Ancient" in its name and the other should say "Mithril." Move the one that says 
		"Ancient" to a General inventory slot. Move the one that says "Mithril" to a container or equp it to move it out of the way.</LI>
	<LI>Double check that the only refined sword in your general inventory slot is the one with "Ancient" in its name. Now, give this sword 
		to Telin Darkforest.</LI>
	<LI>Faelin will spawn and the refined sword with the word "Ancient" in its name will be back in your inventory, in a general slot. Pick up 
		the sword and give it to Faelin.</LI>
	<LI>Faelin will despawn and give you Swiftwind.</LI>
	<LI>Now that you have Swiftwind, equip it.</LI>
</OL></P>

<P><B>Expanded Final Part 3: Xanuusus</B></P>
<P><OL>
	<LI>This part shouldn't give you any trouble. I am including it here, just in case.</LI>
	<LI>Make sure that you have the Refined Mithril Blade and Shattered Emerald of Corruption. If you are missing the Refined Mithril Blade, 
		you will want to see Expanded Final Part 1. If you are missing the Shattered Emerald of Corruption, you will need to attend a Plane of 
		Hate raid to obtain it.</LI>
	<LI>Just look in your inventory for the Shattered Emerald of Corruption and the refined sword with "Mithril" in its name. Give both of these 
		to Xanuusus to receive Earthcaller.</LI>
</OL></P>

<P>If you are still confused as to what to do at this point, my advise it to have another ranger who has done the Epic Quest already be 
there to coach you through the final turn ins. If you are on the Ayonae Ro server, you can give me a tell. Provided that I am not on a raid, 
I will come running over. If you play on another server and wish for me to be there to assist you with the turn ins, send me an email, and I 
will try to work something out with you to be there.</P>
