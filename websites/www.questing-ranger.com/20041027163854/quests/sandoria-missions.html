<P><B>San d'Oria Missions</B></P>

<P><B>1.1: Smash the Orcish Scouts</B></P>

<P>This is a fairly straightforward mission. Just keep killing Orcish Fodder, which can be found roaming Ronfaure and Gheslba until an "Orcish Axe" drops. The axe is a random drop 
and can be obtained even if you do not have this mission active. However it is EX so you do need to loot it yourself. Once you get one, just trade it to either of the mission 
guards to complete this mission. One nice thing about this mission is that it can be repreated thus giving you a way to gain additional mission rank points without having to turn in 
crystals.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>1.2: Bat Hunt</B></P>

<P>You will need to have this mission active in order to trigger the events, but the "Orcish Mail Scales" [Rare / EX] can be turned in if the mission is active so it makes sense to 
activate the mission before you go camp them. The first thig you need to do is is go to the Tomb Stone in King Ranperre's Tomb, and investivate it to see an intermission. After 
the intermission, you will need to kill Ding Bats in any of the above ground sections of King Ranperre's Tomb to get the Orcish Mail Scales if you do not already have them. Once 
this is done, return to San d'Oria and give the Orcish Mail Scales to the mission quest guard.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>1.3: Save the Children</B></P>

<P>The first thing you will need to do is talk ot Arnau in the Cathedrial located in North San d'Oria for an intermission. Afterwards, go to Ghelsba Outpost and examine the door at 
[F-10] to start the boss battle. This fight can be done solo at around L12 by most jobs. Once you have defeated the boss, examine the door again for an intermission.</P>

<P>Reward: Rank 2, 1000G</P>

<HR>

<P><B>2.1: The Rescue Drill</B></P>

<P>You will want to head to La Theine Plateau and talk to where there is an elvaan guard standing by a gorge. After doing so, head down into the gorge and talk to all the 
other guards that you see. Towards the end, you will see a cave entrance which leads to Ordelle's Cave. Enter the cave and towards the left side of the first area behind a rock 
is where you will find Ruillout. Talk to him and he will ask you to retrieve his sword as he would prefer to fight his way out. Go back outside and talk to all of the guards, until one 
of them gives you the sword. [If none of them do, you missed one.] Once you have the "Bronze Sword," go back into Ordelle's Cave and trade it to Ruillout. Go back outside and 
talk to Vicorpasse for a "Rescue Training Certificate." Return to San d'Oria and trade this to the mission guard.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>2.2: The Davoi Report</B></P>

<P>This mission can suck, so you might want to consider skipping it by redoing "Smash the Orcish Scouts" a bunch of times or turn in crystals to the signet guard until you can 
do mission 2.3. If you chose do to this mission, you will need to head to Davoi which is off of Jugner Forest. When you zone in, talk to Zantaviat. He tells you that he has the 
report but lost the page. Now for the sucky part - the page is in the next area on the platform that is on the opposite side of the pond. When you target it, the spot will show up 
as "???" in green text. If you are lucky there will be some higher level people in the area farming orcs, giving you a clear patch to where the report is. Otherwise you will need to 
exercise some caution. When you get the page, talk to Zantaviat again to get the complete report then return to San d'Oria and talk to the mission guard.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>2.3: Journey Abroad</B></P>

<P>For this mission, you can travel to either Bastok or Windurst first. The order does not matter. However whichever one you go to second is where you will have a boss fight. I 
personally went to Bastok first then Windurst.</P>

<P>Part 1 - Bastok<BR>
You will first need to go to the San d'Orian Embassy in Bastok and talk to Pius. Now go to the "Dining Room" and talk to Grohm, who will give you a pickaxe. Mine around [J-8] in 
Palborough Mines until you get the gravel. At this point, you will need to go to the place the gravel inside the refinment "Lid" at [J-7] then use the lever. Drop down the left side 
to the lower level and use the lever here to get the "mythril sand." You will now want to return to the San d'Orian ebassy and give the mythril sand to the ambassador. She will 
wish you luck and you are done with this part.</p>

<P>Part 2 - Windurst<BR>
Go to the San d'Orian embassay in Windurst to talk to the ambassador, then go to Heavens Tower and talk to Kupipi to get the key. You will now need to prepare for a boss 
fight, which is level restricted to L25 and requires a full party. When you are ready for the fight, go to the Burning Circle in Giddeus. After an intermission, you will fight a dragon. 
Once the dragon is defeated, return the ambasador then head back to San d'Oria to talk to the mission guard.</P>

<P>Reward: Rank 3, 3000G</P>

<HR>

<P><B>3.1: Infultrate Davoi</B></P>

<P>This mission is extremely easy if you can make yourself invisible, either by spell or prisim powder. The first tingyou will need to do is go to Chateau d’Origalle then look for 
Prince Trion's quarters to talk to him. After speaking with the prince, you will need to head to Davoi. Once in Davoi, make yourself invisible then head to [H-7] and talk to the 
guard roaming the area to get the report. Return to Prince Trion and give him the report.</P>

<P><B>3.2: The Crystal Spring</B></P>

<P>This mission can be skipped. If you want to fish it yourself, you'll need to go to Junger Forest to do it. While the fish you turn-in for this mission can be purchased at the 
Auction House, it is still a lot easier to just skip this mission either by repeating Mission 1.1 or turning in crystals until mission 3.3 is available.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>3.3: Appointment to Jeuno</B></P>

<P>The first thing you will need to do is to head to Chateau d'Origalle and talk to the king, who will then send you to the San d'Orian embassy in Jeuno [located in Ru'lude 
Gardens.] When you get there, you find that your ambassador is actually somewhere inside Delkfutt's Tower. For this part, you will need either a high level person who can solo 
Porphyrion [L36 NM] with some possible adds or have an alliance to get through the tower and take him out. With Porphyrion out of the way, you will get a Delkfutt Key, which 
allows you to continue on to the basement, where the ambassadors for all nations are.</P>

<P>Reward: Rank 4, 500G</P>

<HR>

<P><B>4.1: Magicite</B></P>

<P>This mission has three parts, which may be done in any order. Before you can even get to the Magicite though, you will need to go to the San d'Orian embassy in Jeuno to 
talk to the ambassador again. You will now be given an audiance with the Archduke of Jeuno, who sends you to talk to Aldo in the Tenshodo. The Tenshodo is located inside the 
Neptune's Spire Inn in Lower Jeuno. If you are not already a member of the Tenshodo, you must do so in order to continue this mission. When you talk to Aldo, he gives you the 
Silver Bell.</P>

<P>Magicite: Aurastone [Beadeaux]:<BR>
First, you will need to get access to the Tenshodo in Lower Jeuno if you do not already have it and may want to do so ahead of time. Now head to Beadeaux, to fight the a 
couple of NM Quadav: Go'Bhu Gascon [for Quadav Augury Shell] and De'Vyu Headhunter [for Quadav Charm.] The way this is typically done is to leave all lower level people who 
need it at the zone-in to wait while several higher levels go kill the NMs. Once you have both, you will need to head to the Tenshodo in Lower Jeuno and talk to Sattal-Mansal 
for two quests [Mysteries of Beadeaux I and Mysteries of Beadeaux II.] Give Sattal-Mansal the two items one at a time, which completes these two quests whose rewards are 
the Coruscant Rosery and Black Matinee Necklace. At this point, you will now want to return to Beadeaux and head to [H-7], where you will find a tunnel. This will lead to the 
Qulun Dome, where you will activate the Magicite here to get another intermission and the "Magicite: Aurastone."</P>

<P>Magicite: Orustone [Castle Oztrajo]:<BR>
This is probably one of the harder ones. You will first need to talk to Paya-Sabya in Lower Jeuno, then talk to Muckvix in the Goblin Shop to get "Yuggott's Torch." You will now 
want to head to Castle Oztrajo, where your goal is to reach the Alter Room. [Sorry, I didn't keep track of how we got there.] In the Alter Room, just activate the Magicite to 
get an intermission and Magicite: Orustone.</P>

<P>Magicite: Optistone [Davoi]:<BR>
This one turned out to be the easiest and can be done solo even if you cannot walk around Davoi safely provided that you can sneak and invisible yourself. The first thing you 
need to do is complete the quest "Crest of Davoi" in Upper Jeuno. [To complete this quest, talk to Baudin then give him coeurl meat.] Once you have the crest, make your way 
to [G-7] in Davoi where you will see a glowing wall. Activate the wall, then pass through it to enter the Monastic Cavern. Look for the Magicite here and activate it to get an 
intermission as well as the "Magicite: Optistone."</P>

<P>Once you have all three Magicite, speak to the Archduke in Jeuno again then return to your embassy.</P>

<P>Reward: Rank 5, 10000G, Airship Pass</P>

<HR>

<P><B>5.1: The Ruins of Fei'Yin</B></P>

<P>This mission cannot be even started until you reach L50. To start, talk to the mission guard in San d'Oria then go to Chateau d’Origalle and talk to Halver. You will now need 
a full party for a L50 caped boss fight and head to Fei'yin. If you have the teleport crystal for Xarcabard, you can port there then run to Beaucedine Glacier. Alternately you can 
run through Ranguemont Pass to get to Beaucedine Glacier. Once in Beaucedine Glacier, head towards [J-4] to get to Fei'Yin. Most mobs in Beaucedine Glacer should not agro 
at this point, with the exception of elementals [if you cast there them] and golems. Inside Fei'Yin however, everything will be agressive, but you can get past it all with just 
sneak. You'll want to work your way to the Qu'Bia Arena to fight the boss. Concentrate on the Archlich Taber'quoan as the minions will all despawn when the boss is killed. 
Afterwards, return to Chateau d’Origalle and talk to Halver again.</P>
