<P><B>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P><I>Kinlo Strongarm is located in Kaladim [B] in Everhot's Forge, bottom floor. If for some reason he reacts negatively to you, 
stand behind him and use sneak.</I></P>

<P>You say, 'what mud'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'Eh? Oh, the clay. Arrr. Lots o that mud round 'ere. Mostly, a good dwarf not be needin somethin so soft 'n squishy but 
the womenfolk, you know, the elves come lookin fer it. If ye be one o' those pansy elves wantin some mud fer workin into fairy statues, 
flashy trinkets, 'n pig sticker arrers then I can get it for ye. Course I'd be lowerin meself, a good dwarf, ta be diggin that kinda mush outta 
the ground, but I can do it fer ya.</P>

<P>You say, 'do it for me'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'Arrr. Shaddap. I ain't doin it til ya bring me somethin. A fee, I guess yed call it, fer lowerin meself ta elf woman work. 
Go get me a good strong axe and I'll do it fer ye. Mebbe somethin with a good tinted polish on it. I got plenty o' axes but no tinted ones. 
Har har! Colored axe. Somethin to go with the color left on the blade after I be crackin open a gobbo head.</P>

<P><B>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P><I>Give Kinlo Storngarm a Jade Reaver, and he will give you Enchanted Clay. If you needed to use sneak to get him to talk to 
you, you will need to use it to give him the Jade Reaver.</I></P>

this one. Oh, here's yer block o' mud. Our priests o' Brell use the mud pit fer relievin themselves after really hard ale blessin ceremonies, so ya
