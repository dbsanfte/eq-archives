<P><B>The Requiem</B><BR>
Client: Bki Tbujhja<BR>
Location: Merry Minstrel Meadhouse [I-8]<BR>
Requirements: Painful Memory, Level 50+ Bard<BR>
Reward: Choral Slippers</P>

<P>Summary: A certain post is rotated at the meadhouse. Now, it's your turn.</P>

<P>Talk to Bki Tbujhja, and she tells you of a ritual performed by the bards of the tavern where a bard makes a journey to Eldieme Necropolis to pay respects to a bard that was 
burried there. Before you go, she wants you to get some Holy Water [which can be made through alchemy or purchased at the auction house under medicines.] Talk to Bki 
Tbujhaja again with the Holy Water in your inventory.</P>

<P>You'll now need an alliance. The amount of people you need will vary depending on the levels you bring. The best advise I can give you is don't make the mistake of thinking 
that one or two L70+ friends will guarantee you a win. The boss can do an AE sleep, which caused my party to fail when everyone was put to sleep but the tank who could not 
cast spells. [To make matters worse, we stayed asleep then entire time as the tank was killed off.] If you do go with a non-casting tank, give him a few potions to wake a healer 
up. ^^</P>

<P>You'll now want to go to Eldieme Necropolis, but must go to the area which requires you to travel to Beaudice Glacier. Once inside Eldieme Necropolis, sneak your way to 
[D-4] and clear all the mobs in the room. Have your party or alliance wait in the coridor just outside the room, with mages standing a bit further away to avoid that sleep I 
mentioned. When you are ready for the boss, put sneak up again then inspect all the coffins in the room until three NMs spawn. You only need to kill the Owl Guard to pass this, 
but this depends on if you manage to pull him by himself.</P>

<P>With this mob [or all three] dead, inspect the same coffin that spawned the NMs. You'll see a brief intermission where the ghost of a bard appears and gives you a Star Ring. 
Return to the Merry Minstrel Meadhouse and talk to Bki Tbujhja again. She doesn't know anything about the ghost, but gives you Choral Slippers.</P>
