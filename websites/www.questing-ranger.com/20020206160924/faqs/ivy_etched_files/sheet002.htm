<P><B>QUEST WALKTHROUGH INTRO</B></P>

<P>These quests are given out by Gandari and Leaf Falldim at the Ranger Guild in Kithicor Forest. I do not have any faction information here 
as there is no reason for a ranger to have bad faction with either of them unless that ranger has been killing stuff that he should not have 
been.</P>

<P>Gandari can be found inside one of the buildings. Her quests tend to be easier and a lot less time consuming. Gandari will give you the 
quests for the: Ivy Etched Bracer, Ivy Etched Helm, Ivy Etched Sleeves and Ivy Etched Tunic. Leaf Falldim will be found outside near the 
central area. His quests tend to either be very time consuming in comparisons to Gandari's. Leaf Fallim will give you the quests for the: Ivy 
Etched Boots, Ivy Etched Gauntlets and Ivy Etched Leggings. These quests can be done in any order, but I am presenting them to you in 
order from head down to feet.</P>

<P>It should be noted that several quests call for different section of the Rune of Ivy. Unfortunately, they all will look the same. If you mix 
them up, you will need a caster to help you by using the "Identify" spell or use an item, such as the Star of Eyes, to identify them 
yourself.</P>
