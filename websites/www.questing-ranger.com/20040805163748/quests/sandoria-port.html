<P><B>Port San d'Oria Quests</B></P>

<P><B>A Discerning Eye (San d'Oria)</B><BR>
Client: Eddy<BR>
Location: Airship Dock, Port San d'Oria [H-6]<BR>
Requirements: Rank 5 Airship Pass<BR>
Items: Dropped Item<BR>
Reward: 500 gil<BR>
Title: Discerning Individual</P>

<P>For these quests, you will be shown what the passanger looks like after you agree to deliver the dropped item. This is the only time you will be shown what the actual 
passanger looks like, so the most successful way to do this that I have found is to make note of the following: race, gender, hair color, hair style, head equipment, body 
equipment, hands equipment, legs equipment and feet equipment. If you give the item to the correct passanger, you will gain 500 gil, which more than covers the cost of the 
flight itself. Also if you have completed all other Discerning Eye quests, you will get the title "Very Discerning Individual" instead.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>A Job for the Consortium</B><BR>
Client: Portaure<BR>
Location: Cargo Room B, Port San d'Oria [H-9]><BR>
Requirements: Rank 5 Airship Pass<BR>
Item: Brugarie Goods<BR>
Reward: 1000G</P>

<P>You will need to be able to use the airship between San d'Oria and Jeuno for this quest as attempting to transport the goods by any other method will result in them being 
damage when you attempt to deliver them in Jeuno. When you talk to Portaure, he will give you the Brugarie Goods if you agree to the quest. You will now want to get on the 
Airship from San d'Oria to Jeuno.</P>

<P>When you arrive in Jeuno, you will need to attempt to get through customs. If you are successful, you will see a "You have cleared customs" message. If you are 
unsuccessful, your airship pass will be revoked until midnight in Japan. For the US, this would be 7am PST or 11am EST. Once you pass through customs, talk to Yin 
Pocanakhu in the Tenshodo Headquarters to deliver the package. When you talk to Portaure again, you will receive the 1000 gil reward and Tenshodo fame.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>A Taste for Meat</B><BR>
Client: Thierride<BR>
Location: Rusty Anchor Pub, Port San d'Oria [G-7]<BR>
Items: 5 Hare Meat<BR>
Reward: 150 gil, Grilled Hare<BR>
Title: Rabbiter</P>

<P>Even though Thierride is the client for this quest, it is initiated by talking to Antreneau. Hare Meat drops off any of the rabbit type mobs in either Ronfaure zone. It can also 
be purchased from the auction house if you are doing this quest at a later level and do not want to be bothered killing the rabbits yourself. When you return, Thierride gives you 
150 gil in exchange for the hare meat. If you talk to Antreneau again, he gives you a slice of grilled hare.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>The Brugaire Consortium</B><BR>
Client: Fontoumant<BR>
Location: Cargo Room B, Port San d'Oria [H-10]<BR>
Items: Magic Shop Parcel, Auction House Parcel, Tavern Parcel<BR>
Reward: Lauan Shield<BR>
Title: Courier Extraordinaire</P>

<P>This is a very easy delivry quest that takes place entirely in Port San d'Oria. Fontoumant will give you one parcel to deliver at a time, and you will need to return to him 
afterwards for the next. When you talk to him after making the third delivery, he rewards you with the lauan shield.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>The Dismayed Customer</B><BR>
Client: Gulemont<BR>
Location: Rusty Anchor Pub, Port San d'Oria [G-7]<BR>
Requirements: A Taste For Meat<BR>
Items: Documents<BR>
Reward: 560G<BR>
Title: Lost & Found Officer</P>

<P>There are three areas where the documents may be at: [G-9] at the outpost, [G-11] near Knightswell and [F-11] near wall close to La Theine Plateau. Once you have found 
the document, return to Gulemont for your reward.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>The Pickpocket</B><BR>
Client: Altiret<BR>
Location: Airship Docks, Port San d'Oria [I-8]<BR>
Items: Eagle Button, Pair of Glit Glasses<BR>
Reward: Light Axe<BR>
Title: Pickpocket Pilcher</P>

<P>This quest is initiated by talking to Miene [I-8]. When you do this, a pickpocket shows up, steals the glasses from Altiret then bumps into you before getting away. You will 
then want to talk to Altiret, who will ask for your help getting them back thus initiating the actual quest. Talk to Miene agian to get an Eagle Button. [If you try talking to her 
again without talking to Altiret, she will suggest that you help him.] You'll now want to go to West Ronfaure and look for Esca who is inside a tower [F-6]. You can talk to her, 
but this is optional. Give Esca the eagle button, and she will give you the glasses.</P>
