<P><B>The Binden Concerrentia FAQ</B><BR>
by Crydee Ossiriand, Torvonnilous Server<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.questing-ranger.com">http://www.questing-ranger.com</A><BR>
Version: 2004.06.01</P>

<P><B>Chapter 1: Tiny Bottle and Note</B></P>

<P>This chapter mostly covers the starting point, which leads into the actual quest. Despite being more of a prologue than anything else, it cannot be 
skipped.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Jimlok Keylifter'<BR>
Jimlok Keylifter says 'Well met, traveler. Can I be of assistance to you? Can't say as I got much to do at the moment. I'm just attending to a little fishing 
while I wait on my friend to get back to me. Hopefully he doesn't keep me waiting for too much longer. I can only stand so much of this place.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what friend?'<BR>
Jimlok Keylifter says 'This is the situation. My friend Gilor Swiftfoot and I were going to try our hand at breaking into the Plane of Justice. Yeah, yeah, I'm 
sure you're thinking that's silly and all, but how many people do you know of that can say they've broken out of the Eternal Prison, let alone in? 'None', 
right? So, we were all ready to go in when I got word that something else needed re-appropriating all quick like. I told Gilor to wait until I got back, but no. 
He had to run off, eager as always and as patient as a gust of wind. Now, I think he's in trouble.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what trouble?'<BR>
Jimlok Keylifter says 'People here seem to think that he tried to make the prison break by himself. They've found another way in, so maybe he took that 
route. I'd like to check on him, but if he isn't in there, I'm liable to get myself in trouble. I think I'd be much better off staying here and waiting for him. If 
you want to go look for him, I'd be quite grateful. I doubt you have the skills to get far in there. You don't look like the burglarizing type, but I'd even be 
willing to give you the document that I picked up on my last job if you look for him.'</P>

<P>You say, 'what document?'<BR>
Jimlok Keylifter says 'Don't you worry about that unless you bring me some word of Gilor's condition. Trust me, it's a strange and mysterious document. Just 
the sort of thing you adventuring types love. Find Gilor and it's all yours, I give you my word.'</P>

<P>You say, 'i will look for him'<BR>
Jimlok Keylifter says 'Alright, friend, you need to be on the lookout for a gnome about my height, with one bad leg. He's got a bit of a limp, but he's still a hard 
one to chase down. If you can't find him, be on the lookout for anything that resembles a small bottle. He's got a way with rodents; so if you see some little 
pest carrying a bottle of some sort, grab him! It will most likely be a message for me. Bring it back immediately. It won't be of any use to you anyway, since 
you can't read our code. Be quick and good luck!'</P>

<P>At this point you will want to go to the Plane of Justice and kill the Festering Rats until you get a "Tiny Bottle and Note." The drop is slightly uncommon 
and can be obtained before talking to Jimlok Keylifter.</P>

<P>*Give "Tiny Bottle and Note" to Jimlok Keylifter.*<BR>
Jimlok Keylifter sighs deeply as he hands you an intricate schematic of some device. The notation on the document is written in a strange language that is 
completely foreign to you. 'This doesn't bode well for Gilor. He says he's found a secret tunnel and he's going to go in deeper. I guess I'll go in and find him if 
he doesn't return soon. Well, a deal is a deal. Here is the document that I mentioned.'<BR>
*Jimlok Keylifter gives you the <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('strange_jewelers_schematic')">Strange Jeweler's Schematic</A>.*<BR>
Jimlok Keylifter says 'The person that I was supposed to lift it for was a jeweler of sorts, but he mainly dealt in mechanical devices. I wasn't able to track him 
down to get my coin, so I don't know what you'll do with it. Maybe my cousin Tabben will give you something for it. He's got himself a little tinker's shop in 
the Jeral section of New Tanaan. Show him the map thingy and see what he says.'</P>

<P><B>Chapter 2: Small Clockwork Talisman</B></P>

<P>This chapter covers the first actual gate necklace that you will obtain. All drops for this part are obtained from Tier 1 zones.</P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Tabben Bromal'<BR>
Tabben Bromal says 'What is it? What do you wan. . . Oh bloody underfoot, do forgive me, traveler. I'm not used to all this bickering and flittering about -- 
you know, the bustle of the 'living' city. The racket, the noise, and the wails of the children. Bah! I came here to escape it, not to relive it. But if I survived 
it once, I sure as Brell's holy bottom will do it again! In hopes of getting you all out of here as soon as possible and the peace and quiet being resurrected 
out of your blessed absence, I've agreed to lend some of my knowledge of the more inferior levels of tinkering to those who have an interest in this art. If 
you don't intend on purchasing any materials, then be off with you and leave me in peace. However, if you have coin in your pocket and you plan on 
spending, then do so quickly. I have more pressing things to do with my time than wait while you leisurely browse my wares.'</P>

<P>*Give the "Strange Jeweler's Schematic" to Tabben Bromal.*<BR>
Tabben Bromal takes the document from you and looks at it for a moment. 'Well, this is a beautiful looking schematic. I wonder what they are trying to make 
with it? Where did you get this?  No wait; don't tell me. I'd rather not know. I can make some of this writing out but just barely. What I can read leads me 
to believe that I'd be better off not knowing.'<BR>
Tabben Bromal falls victim to his curiosity and grabs a small kit from the table behind him. 'Take this kit and look for the following parts,' he says as he 
scrunches his nose at the schematic again. 'We'll need a Tri-coated Metal Casing, one Size C spring, some Creeping silk strands -- whatever those are -- 
and some Congealed Bile-based Ooze. I'm not sure if this thing is wanting us to make a device or some sort of nasty cocktail, but that's what it's asking 
for... ewww!'<BR>
*Tabben Bromal gives you the <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('small_parts_kit')">Small Parts Kit</A>.*<BR>
Tabben Bromal says 'Seal those things up in the container that I just gave you and bring it straight back to me. I'll wait here for you and see if I can 
decipher anymore of this schematic.'</P>

<P>You will now need to gather the items that Tabben Bromal mentioned, which can be found on differen mobs in the Tier 1 zones:<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('congealed_bilebased_ooze')">Congealed Bile-Based Ooze</A>: random spiders, Plane of Nightmares<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('creeping_silk_strands')">Creeping Silk Strands</A>: random Biles, Plane of Disease<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('size_c_spring')">Size C Spring</A>: random models, Plane of Innovation<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('tricoated_metal_casing')">Tri-Coated Metal Casing</A>: random spiders, Plane of Innovation</P>

<P>Please note that the loot tables for the spiders and biles appears to have been switched and may or may not get fixed at some point in the future. 
Should the drop appear on the mob other than what I specified above, try the other. Once you have all four items, place them in the Small Parts Kit then 
combine to get the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('sealed_parts_box')">Sealed Parts Box</A>."</P>

<P>Give "Sealed Parts Box" to Tabben Bromal.<BR>
Tabben Bromal says 'Oh, you've returned! Very good, Crydee! Saria and I have made some real progress on the document that you brought us. Watch this 
and you'll see what I mean!'<BR>
Tabben Bromal quickly opens the small case and removes the parts. He takes a tiny spanner, several small bolts, and a long wire and quickly pieces together 
what appears to be a small clockwork talisman. He pulls a leather string through the top of it and offers it to you.<BR>
*Tabben Bromal gives you the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('small_clockwork_talisman')">Small Clockwork Talisman</A>.*<BR>
Tabben Bromal says 'That should work for you, but from what we gathered, there's another layer of mechanics that works to shield and envelope the existing 
talisman. It's going to require more parts. So take this container and let me know when you're ready to write down the names of the next set of parts.'<BR>
*Tabben Bromal gives you the "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('small_parts_container')">Small Parts Container</A>."<BR>

<HR>

<P><B>Chapter 3: Powered Clockwork Talisman</B></P>

<P>This chapter covers the second gate necklace that you will obtain. All drops for this part are obtained from Tier 2 and 3 zones.</P>

<P>You say, 'I am ready'<BR>
Tabben Bromal says 'Very well. You'll need to gather up a dense hammered casing for the outer shell; a crystalline carapace will act to protect the face of 
the device; and it requires a fiery power source to propel the rotor mechanism.  The device is then attached around the neck, much like the one you are 
wearing. The only difference will be the strands of living chain that will keep it from slipping from around your neck. Place those four items and your talisman 
in that box and return it to me. We should be able to get this thing built for you without much fuss at all, should all things go well on your end of the task, of 
course.'</P>

<P>You will now need to gather the items that Tabben Bromal mentioned, which can be found on differen mobs in the Tier 2 and 3 zones. Once you have all 
four items, place them in the Small Parts Container and comebine to produce a 
"<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('locked_parts_box')">Locked Parts Box</A>."<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('crystalline_carapace')">Crystalline Carapace</A>: spiders, Plane of Valor<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('dense_hammered_casing')">Dense Hammered Casing</A>: random Daiku's, Plane of Tactics<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('fiery_power_source')">Fiery Power Source</A>: random mobs, Tower of Solusek Ro<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('strands_of_living_chain')">Strands of Living Chain</A>: trap spiders, Plane of Torment</P>

<P>*Give the "Locked Parts Box" and "Small Clockwork Talisman" to Tabben Bromal.*<BR>
Tabben Bromal nods at you and takes the parts box over to the table. He seems to have laid out the extra tools that he needs prior to your return. With 
only a few twists and clicks, the pieces of the talisman lock together and begin to glow. The gnome turns and hands you the talisman and the design 
schematic in an exaggeratedly sharp gesture.<BR>
*Tabben Bromal gives you the <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('powered_clockwork_talisman')">Powered Clockwork Talisman</A>.*<BR>
Tabben Bromal says 'Please take the schematic to Elder Clinka. I'm afraid that I don't have the courage to spend any more time working on this for you. I 
wish I had a more adventurous spirit, but I don't. I like it here because it's peaceful. I don't need anyone changing that for me. Take care and be cautious 
on your way to see her. There's no telling who or what may be after you!  When you show her the schematic, you may want to mention that most of that 
writing wasn't on there when we got it.'<BR>
*Tabben Bromal gives you <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('the_talisman_schematic')">The Talisman Schematic</A>.*<BR>
Tabben Bromal says 'It's seems that words are beginning to write themselves onto that schematic of yours. Maybe she'll be able to understand them. I sure 
don't want to. Take care.'</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Chapter 4: The Binden Concerrentia</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Elder Clinka'<BR>
Elder Clinka does not seem to notice you.</P>

<P>*Give "The Talisman Schematic" to Elder Clinka*<BR>
Elder Clinka says 'It is a pleasure to see meet you. I've heard a great deal about you from the other elders. Please give me a moment to scan over this for 
you.'<BR>
Elder Clinka scans the schematic for a few seconds, mumbling as she reads, 'This parchment states that you are to place a small shard of concentrated 
elemental matter into each of the holes in your talisman.' She points a finger to the diagram as she begins to recount what she has learned from it, 'They 
would then need to be locked into place, as the diagram indicates here.'<BR>
Elder Clinka says 'If you bring me a fragment or shard of some living creature from each of the elemental planes, I will see if we can make this device work. 
Place them in this lined box and return them to me immediately with your talisman. In the meantime, I will continue to translate this document from it's 
original language.'<BR>
*Elder Clink gives you the <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('small_lined_case')">Small Lined Case</A>.*</P>

<P>At this point you need to gather living fragments from each of the four elemental planes. These are all random drops off of mephit type mobs in the 
zone:<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('a_living_fragment_of_air')">A Living Fragment of Air</A> [Plane of Air]: drops off A Temple Guardian<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('a_living_fragment_of_earth')">A Living Fragment of Earth</A> [Plane of Earth]: any mob with "Vekerchiki" in its 
name<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('a_living_fragment_of_fire')">A Living Fragment of Fire</A> [Plane of Fire]: any mob with "Jopal" in its name<BR>
- <A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('a_living_fragment_of_water')">A Living Fragment of Water</A> [Plane of Water]: any mob with "Triloun" in its 
name</P>

<P>Once you have all four living fragments, place them in the Small Lined Case then combine to get the 
"<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('sealed_lined_case')">Sealed Lined Case</A>."</P>

<P>*Give the "Sealed Lined Case" and "Powered Clockwork Talisman" to Elder Clinka.*<BR>
Elder Clinka carefully opens the small box and takes several small tools from the pocket in her robe. Her nimble fingers place the glowing elemental pieces 
into the appropriate sockets and covers them with several small caps that she must have made while you were away.<BR>
Elder Clinka then looks up at you and says, 'This device is called the Binden Concerrentia.  Its true power will be revealed to you soon. This document 
describes it as a device that is meant to convert the energy that can be found in true prime elemental matter, into an entirely new form of energy. The 
schematic states that this energy will 'bind you in the now'. I am not sure what that means, but I believe that you will soon find out.<BR>
Elder Clinka says 'Take care of it and keep it with you at all times. I feel that your journey from this point will only become more dangerous. Perhaps this 
device will play a role in all of that. Move forward along the path of enlightenment. May the Balance guide your fate.'<BR>
*Elder Clinka gives you "<A HREF="javascript:popupInventory('the_binden_concerrentia')">The Binden Concerrentia</A>."</P>

<P>The Binden Concerrentia still needs to use the reagent "Quintessence of Knowledge." However unlike its previous forms, it does not have a limited number 
of charges in and of itself.</P>
