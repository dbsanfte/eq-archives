<P><B>Merdan Fleetfoot in Surefall Glade, Antonica</B></P>

<P>You say, 'hail Merdan Fleetfoot'<BR>
Merdan Fleetfoot says 'Yes Niera! Oh. Erm. Hi. I mean, uh. How are you?'<BR>
You say, 'Who is Niera?'<BR>
Merdan Fleetfoot blushes. 'She is, uh.. I don't know. I havent been able to speak with her. She has many suitors, and I'm just another poor 
ranger. I spend my days here pretending to fish, to carve bows, but really I'm just waiting to catch a limpse of her. I thought about 
adventuring into the world to find some kind of token to give her, to show her how I feel, but I cant tear myself away from here.'</P>

<P><I>Give Merdan Fleetfoot a Rose of Firiona, which is foraged in Fironia Vie on Kunark.</I></P>

<P>Merdan Fleetfoot blinks and looks at the flower. 'This is perfect. Thank you! I'm going to go over to her now. Erm, well, maybe 
I'll wait a week to let the uh.. beauty of the flower.. uhm.. blossom. Yes, that sounds good. Here, you take this painting. I don't need it now. 
I made it myself, she wouldn't like it anyways.'</P>

<P><I>Merdan Fleetfoot gives you a "Wood Painting" to give to a Human Skeleton.</I></P>

<P><B>Niera Farbreeze in Surefall Glade, Antonica</B></P>

<P><I>Sit by Niera Farbreeze for a while until she starts to hum a tune. [Actually, this is optional and you can immediately ask her 
about the tune if you want or just skip this part completely.]</I></P>

<P>Niera Farbreeze hums softly, a little tune that tickles the back of your mind but you can't quite recall.<BR>
You say, 'What tune is that.'<BR>
Niera Farbreeze says 'Ohh. Just a little song my mother taught me when I was young. It speaks of the earth, the sky, and the sparkling stars 
above, always there.'<BR>
You say, 'Why are they always there?'<BR>
Niera Farbreeze says 'Aye, always there. Like this small bag I wear around my neck. The last gift of my dying mother. It holds a fine dust, a 
dust she collected during her short life, that she believed brought her luck. It's speckled, lecked as the night sky is with stars.'<BR>
You say, 'Where did she find the speckled, flecked dust?'<BR>
Niera Farbreeze says 'I've had this little bit of dust, all I have of my mother, for many years now. It's the only reminder I have of her. She 
said it was special, magical, a warmth to help me through the nights. Even if my life were in the balance, I would have a hard time giving 
it up.'</P>

<P><B>Human Skeleton in Frontier Mountains</B></P>

<P><I>At around NEG 2100, POS 2000; there is a human skeleton. The skeleton is not fixed to this spot and will walk around some. 
If you do not find the Human Skeleton right away, run around this location and keep checking tracking. Since the Human Skeleton will 
despawn, you might have to wait for it to spawn again. Give the wood painting to the human skeleton.</I></P>

<P>a human skeleton begins to crack and disintegrate, its body collapsing into a pile of dust that scatters into the winds. On the 
ground you notice a locket on a fine, thin chain which you pick up.</P>

<P><I>You get a "Silver Chained Locket"</I></P>

<P>Niera Farbreeze says 'This, this is my mother's amulet. I cannot believe it. Please, take this powder you say you need. Perhaps 
it does have powers, I don't know, I don't care. Thank you, my eternal thanks for this.</P>
