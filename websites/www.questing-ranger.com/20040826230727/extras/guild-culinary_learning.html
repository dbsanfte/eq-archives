<P><B>Learning a Skill: Cooking</B></P>

<P>This section is a work in progress as I am still learning the culinary trade myself. Also you cannot fail the cooking tests. Just give the NPC the appropriate food item after 
talking to him, and you automatically pass it.</P>

<P><B>Hard-Boiled Egg</B> [0-6]<BR>
Crystal: Fire<BR>
Ingredients: Bird Egg, Distilled Water</P>

<P>If you start out cooking early in your character's life, you can get most of the ingredients yourself while you gain EXP thus making this recipe one of the more inexpensive. 
Fire Crystals drop off the orcs around San d'Oria [just make sure you have a signet up] and Bird Eggs drop off the bird-type mobs in La Theine Plateau that are common exp 
mobs before going to Valkurm Dunes. The only thing you should need to buy is the Distilled Water. Alternately, Lizard Eggs may be used in place of Bird Eggs but the trivial raiting 
when using them is 4 instead of 6.</P>

<P><B>Orange Juice</B> [7-10]<BR>
Crystal: Water<BR>
Ingredients: Saruta Orange x4</P>

<P>Saruta Oranges can be purchased from the regional vendor that controls the Sarutabaruta Region, which may be Windurst in most cases. While this may seem inconvient 
for those living in San d'Oria and Bastok, you should consider that the Culinary Guild itself is in Windurst and you will need to make regular trips to it. Orange Juice generally 
does not sell enough to make it worthwhile, and it doesn't stack. If you are playing a mage job and are at your younger levels, you can still get a use out of it. Stock up on 
a stack or two of water crystals and enough oranges for amount of crystals you have. Now go join an exp group and make juice as you need it.</P>

<P><B>Cooking Test #1:</B> Salmon Sub [8-10]</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Sliced Sardine</B> [11]<BR>
Crystal: Wind<BR>
Ingredients: Bastore Sardine</P>

<P>While this recipe often gets recommended sooner, I'm not that fond of it. Wind crystals typically sell for a lot on my server. The amount of gil I get for selling Sliced 
Sardine doesn't cover what I could have made had I just sold those wind crystals instead. It is however a rather convient recipe though as you buy Bastore Sardines at the 
Fishing Guild in Windurst.</P>

<P><B>Selbina Butter</B> [12-20]<BR>
Crystal: Ice<BR>
Ingredients: Rock Salt, Selbina Milk</P>

<P>This is a relatively cheap recipe, but you will fail a lot at first. Don't worry about this too much as you will have more butter than you know what to do with even before you 
hit 20 in the skill. I highly recommend having a storage mule for this one just so that you have room for other things. Ice crystals are among the cheaper ones to buy. Rock Salt 
can be purchased at the grocery store in South San d'Oria. Selbina Milk can be purchased either at Selbina or from the regional vendor of the city that controls the Zulkheim 
region. When you hit the 18-20 range, go do the cooking test.</P>

<P><B>Apple Juice</B> [17-20]<BR>
Crystal: Water<BR>
Ingredients: Faerie Apple X4</P>

<P>Similar to Orange Juice, but with a bit more sale value. Even then I general only make it when I want want juice while I am in an exp party. Faerie Apples can be purchased 
at the grocery store in San d'Oria when the city is in first place. I remember there being other vendors but I forget off the top of my head. This is more of an alternate recipe to 
do if you find that you really don't have storage space for yet more butter.</P>

<P><B>Cooking Test #2:</B> Pea Soup [18-20]</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Insect Ball</B> [21-29]<BR>
Crystal: Earth<BR>
Ingredients: Distilled Water, Little Worm, Millioncorn</P>

<P>I haven't hit this recipe yet myself as I'm at still 19 in cooking, but this one definately is the next one to do.</P>
