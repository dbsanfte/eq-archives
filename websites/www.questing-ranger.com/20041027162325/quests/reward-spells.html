Location: Cermet Refinery, Metalworks [G-7]<BT>
Items: Slime Oil<BR>
Reward: Scroll of Warp</P>

<P>Slime Oil is a drop from slime-type mobs. However this is at L18 spell and slimes might be a bit difficult still at that point and even with two treasure hunters in the party, the 
are a rare drop. It can also be purchased from the Auction House under Alchemy Materials.</P>

Location: Bostaunieux Oubliete [F-8]<BR>
Requirements: Rank 2<BR>
Items: Beastmen Blood<BR>
Reward: Scroll of Drain</P>

<P>This quest requires a lot of fame to even start it. If Novalmauge tells you that you do not belong here, this is why. Also you may get a different intermission that involves a 
prisoner if trying to do this while L30 or higher, which is associated the Dragoon job quest. If this occurs, try talking to Novalmauge again. Also citizens of Bastok and Windurst 
will need to be Rank 3 and have talked to their respective embassay in San d'Oria before gaining access to the Chateau. The Beastmen Blood you need is a random rare drop off 
leeches. It can also be purchased from the Auction House under Beastmen made items.</P>

<P>After you give Novalmauge the Beastmen Blood there will be an intermission where he asks if you believe the rumor or not. I picked no and Novalmauge said that I'm a kind 
soul... no idea what he will say if you picked yes.</P>
