<P><B>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark</B></P>

<P><I>Telin Darkforest can be found near the zone to Skyfire Mountains. The easiest way to find him is to head to the North West part of 
the zone, towards Skyfire, and you should eventually pick him up on tracking.</I></P>

<P>You say, 'hail Telin Darkforest'<BR>
Telin Darkforest looks at you serenely. 'Hello, wanderer.'<BR>
You say, 'what are you doing in this forest'<BR>
Telin Darkforest says 'Mighty this place must have been, once. Now scarred by hatred and suffering. I have been sent here seeking answers 
to problems not yet understood.<BR>
You say, 'what answers'<BR>
Telin Darkforest considers you for a few moments before speaking. 'A great evil walks across the land. The hand of some demon we don't 
yet know is twisting and polluting forests.'<BR>
You say, 'what evil'<BR>
Telin Darkforest says 'If I knew that, I wouldnt be here looking for answers. I would be elsewhere, looking for solutions. For now, I suspect 
much but know little.<BR>
You say, 'what do you suspect'<BR>
Telin Darkforest looks at you and sighs. 'The lands are changing. Beasts, large and small, have turned upon those who watched over them. 
Druids and rangers, worshippers of both Karana and Tunare, have reported a feeling of hatred throughout their once peaceful lands.'<BR>
You say, 'perhaps it is Innoruuk'<BR>
Telin Darkforest raises his eyebrow slightly and a subtle look of surprise creeps across his face. 'Innoruuk? Perhaps. Aye. It must be. Perhaps 
I knew and didn't want to consider the possibility. It must be this though, and some action will have to be taken.'<BR>
You say, 'what action should I take'<BR>
Telin Darkforest looks at you consideringly and then scribbles something quickly on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful enough. Perhaps 
you can help those who seek to protect nature's peace. Take this note. Deliver it only into the hands of Faelin Bloodbriar. Where you will find 
her, I cannot say. She is a friend of mine and a wanderer. She has been seen from one end of the lands to the other. Seek her out, and 
quickly.'</P>

<P><I>Telin Darkforest gives you a "Worn Note" to take to Faelin Bloodbriar.</I></P>

<P><B>Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark, Faydwer</B></P>

<P><I>Faelin Bloodbriar spawns at POS 1500, POS 500 in Greater Faydark. Her placeholder is an orc pawn. Faelin is a rare spawn. Just hang 
around this area and kill all orc pawns you see around the area. Once you see either Faelin or an orc pawn spawn, you can procede to camp 
just that spot and not worry about additional orcs.</I></P>

<P>Give Telin’s note to Faelin<BR>
Faelin Bloodbriar reads the note carefully and growls to herself. 'Bad news, eh? Take this ring. There is one elf, dark elf even, who we must 
go to in order to gather insight into Innoruuk's plans. Giz X'Tin, he goes by most commonly. Kithicor seems to be his favorite haunt and most 
likely you will find him there. Don't ask how I know him. Just take the ring as my sign to him and he will speak to you. We don't need to speak 
again, so dont seek me out, just goto Telin. I must leave to investigate these events.'</P>

<P><I>Faelin Bloodbriar gives you "Faelins Ring" to take to take to Giz X'Tin.</I></P>

<HR>

<P><B>Giz X`Tin in Kithicor Forest, Antonica</B></P>

<P><I>Giz X'Tin is a wandering spawn that has been mostly seen towards the north end of the zone. He said to spawn around POS 1000, 
POS 1500. It is known that he does wander the zone. I have seen hin on track durning the day and night time. The easiest way that I have 
found to find him is to run along the way between West Commons and Rivervale. If he is up, you will most likely pick him up on tracking. Most 
likely your faction with Giz X'Tin will not be high enough, cast Spirit of Wolf on yourself, run up behind him and sneak before you give him 
Faelin's Ring.</I></P>

<P>Give Faelin’s Ring to Giz X'Tin<BR>
Giz X`Tin flips you a coin after he recognizes the ring. 'It seems we have a mutual 'acquaintance.' The coin repays an old debt. You don't 
have to worry about what that is. Luckily, Lord Innoruuk has informed me of your coming and your desires. Fortunately, I have all the 
answers you require right here at the end of my friend's blade. I think I'll be paying my old 'friend' a visit.'<BR>
Teir`Dal Reaver says 'Lord Innoruuk, I have failed you. Forgive me and spare me from service to your undead minions in the world!</P>

<P><I>Giz X'Tin gives you a "Dark Metal Coin" to take to Telin Darkforest.</I></P>

<P><I>A Teir'Dal Reaver will spawn when you get the Dark Metal Coin. There is no reason to kill the reaver here unless you want some fun. 
He drops nothing and you already have the coin for the next part. The reaver is said to be level 50 exactly and tough to fight. I just got the 
coin and ran.</I></P>

<HR>

<P><B>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark</B></P>

<P>Give coin to Telin<BR>
Telin Darkforest scratches the coin as he looks at it. 'Faelin sent you to Giz? Surprising. This coin speaks to the outcome of your talk. He 
would hardly give this bit of metal to a stranger, but that's a story for a different time. So, you say Giz did confirm Innoruuk's involvement, 
and something about undead minions? Here, take this coin back. Find Arch Druid Althele in the Karanas and show her that. Tell her what we 
have discussed. She will look kindly on an ally in this matter.'</P>

<P><I>Telin Darkforest gives you a "Worn Dark Metal Coin" to take to Althele.</I></P>

<P><B>Althele in East Karana, Antonica</B></P>

<P><I>NOTE: Do not procede with this part until you are ready to deal with the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Dark Elf Reavers that will spawn. 
If you fail to kill the Dark Elf Corruptor you will have to the start quest over from the beginning. You will also want to check the spawn before 
proceeding. You should only see Tholris and Fang with Althele. If you see any of the other druids with Althele, then either someone is in the 
process of doing this part or the spawn is bugged. In cases when the spawn is bugged, you will need to wait for a server rest to be able to 
do this part of the quest.</I></P>

<P><I>Althele can be found close to the Barbarian Village around NEG 3650, NEG 1600. Tholris and Fang should also be there with her. If 
you see any of the other druids with her, do not give her the coin right away. First check to see if someone is currently in the process of 
doing this part of the quest. If this is the case, just wait for them to finish up. Althele, Tholris and Fang all respawn thirty minutes after all 
the druids have been despawned. The other possibility, is that someone had tried to do this part of the quest, failed and the spawn is 
messed up. If this is the case, you may have to wait for the server till after the server goes down again to be able to the quest.</I></P>

<P>You say, 'hail Althele'<BR>
Althele says 'Hello, friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally but lately?<BR>
Give Coin to Althele<BR>
Althele looks at the coin and nods gravely at you as she slips it into a fold of her clothing. 'I see. The story of this coin speaks much to me 
as do the words you have given me. Telin sent word that you would arrive. The tidings you bring are ill indeed. Here, take this amulet and 
find Sionae. She is nearby. We will speak more on this matter when all are present.'</P>

<P><I>Althele gives you a "Braided Grass Amulet" to take to Sionae.</I></P>

<P>You say, 'hail Tholris'<BR>
Tholris stares in contemplation at the landscape.<BR>
Althele says 'Tholris does not speak much. He is here to assist me in my duties. He is my hands, as Fang is my eyes.<BR>
Fang barks in response to Althele's words.<BR>
You say, 'why do you need him as your hands and fang as your eyes?'<BR>
Althele says 'Yes. I cannot see any longer, my sight long since lost in the march of years. By the blessings of Tunare
and Karana, though, I still make myself useful.</P>

<P><I> Sionae spawns after you get the Braided Grass Amulet and can be found around NEG 2300, NEG 930.</I></P>

<P>Give amulet to Sionae<BR>
Sionae says 'I see that the time has come. Take the amulet and give it to the third of our kin, Nuien. I will meet you at the gathering.</P>

<P><I>Sionae gives you a "Frayed Braided Grass Amulet" to take to Nuien, who spawns near NEG 3650, NEG 300.</I></P>

<P><I>You need to move quickly to Nuien. People who are Kill on Sight to druids may walk past him because of where he spawns. If this 
happens, Nuien will argo on that person. I do not know if he will argo on any hostile mobs in the area, but it is best to move quickly and not 
take that chance. If Nuien is killed, the spawn will be messed up and you will have to start all over. Even if Nuien argos on someone, you can 
still give him the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet. He will then start walking to the gathering place and Teloa will spawn.</I></P>

<P>Give amulet to Nuien<BR>
Nuien says 'So be it. Do as you have done before and find the next. Teloa is the last.</P>

<P><I>Nuien gives the "Frayed Braided Grass Amulet" back to you, and Teloa spawns near the waterfall around NEG 3800, NEG 2860.</I></P>

<P>Give amulet to Teloa<BR>
Teloa begins walking toward the gathering spot. 'Follow me to the gathering now.'</P>

<P><I>Follow Teloa back to where Althele is, which is where the druids are gathering. You will not have the amulet at this point as she does 
not return it to you.</I></P>

<P>Althele says 'Great mother of life and father of sky, growth and spirit, Tunare and Karana. Innoruuk once again schemes and we have 
failed in our duties to protect our land. We give our powers in sacrifice for your help. Heed our call and send us your wisdom.<BR>
Althele snaps her head towards you. 'Innoruuk's brood is upon us. Go, find the spawn of hatred before they reach this point and destroy 
them!'</P>

<P><I>Dark Elf Corruptor and several Dark Reavers spawn, level supposed to be 50ish. Only the Corruptor is said to have to be killed. It is 
recommended that you root him, so he does not despawn on you. Additionally, it has been mentioned that he cannot be pulled, so you have 
to rush in and attack him.</I></P>

<P>Dark Elf Corruptor shouts 'We come for you, fools. Your reign of weakness over the powers of the land comes to an end 
now!</P>

<P><I>The easist way to do this is to have two group of people waiting on the hill. The first group will attack the Dark Elf Corruptor 
immediately. The second group will kite the Dark Elf Reavers to keep them distracted until the Corruptor has been killed. Even though you 
will miss most [or all] of the fighting, you should be one of the people in the group killing the Corruptor just so that you will be able to loot 
his corpse right away and get the "Fleshbound Tomb."<BR>
Once the Dark Elf Corruptor is killed, the group killing the Corruptor will take out the reavers. Even though some advocate killing the 
corruptor and letting the reavers get the druids. I don't recommend this for several reasons. First off, it is not within the theme of the 
quest to let the druids get killed. Secondly, it is more time productive to kill the reavers also then turn in the Felshbound Tomb to Althele 
right away as you will have to wait longer to turn in the book.</I></P>

<P>'Althele hands the book to Tholris who reads through it with lines of concern etched on his face, then whispers into her ear. 'Dire news, 
indeed. This cannot be allowed. I must keep this book but you, XXXX , must not allow Innoruuk, to seed the land with his hatred and filth. 
You have only just begun your quest. The path you are guided upon will be difficult, if not impossible, but someone must finish it. Please, 
take this, read of it, follow its instructions. Tunare bless your path and Karana watch over you.'</P>

to her kin. Give her this note and she will know'</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket, Antonica</B></P>

<P><I>Go to Misty Thicket and wait near the guards that are close to the zone to Rivervale. Ella Foodcrafter will run all over the zone. The 
wait usually isn't long, so it is easier to wait for her to come to the guards. She doesn't stay in one place for long, so you may want to bring 
along a friend to constantly hail until you give her the Earth Stained Note.</I></P>

<P>You say, 'hail Ella Foodcrafter'<BR>
Ella Foodcrafter says 'Hi, hi. I've got a lot to do, many mouths to feed, some filthy goblins to smack. If you don't need me for something, 
please let me go back to my work. Karana watch over you.'</P>

<P><I>Make sure that you have at least one General inventory slot free as the next item you receive is a container. Give 
Earth Stained note to Ella Foodcrafter.</I></P>

<P>Ella Foodcrafter says 'Hmmm. I've been waiting for someone to bring me this. I'm sorry such a young one as you has taken up this task. 
Maybe the sky god blesses ya though. Aye, ya have that look in your eye. Our task is to focus the blessings of the gods and cleanse the 
filth from the land. I'll need two things from ya.<BR>
You say, 'what two things?'<BR>
Ella Foodcrafter says 'Well, ya ask before ya act. That's a good sign. What I need isn't easy to find. First, I need a mixture. Plain sounding 
enough but it's a special one. Cleanses the mind and focuses the earth's energies into a forest walker's mind. I don't know how to make it. 
I don't even know what it's called. I merely know it exists and we'll be needing it for our task. When ya do find how to make it ya can mix 
it in that bowl. Keep it when youre done, it's a good bowl.'</P>

ancient type of bowl, which strengthened the food placed inside it, once made by the elves of old. Again, I cannot tell ya how it is made 
for the making was lost to the ages. Seek this knowledge and these items out in the lands. Come to me when ya have found both.'</P>
