<P><I>Alrik Farsight is on a Island near the fire pots in the South-West part of the zone. He can be found either on or very close to the 
chessboard. If he will not respond to you, go to the Magician's Guild in Felwithe B and give Niola Impholder four bat wings at a time until she 
is amiable to you. If you have trouble gettin Niola Impholder to take the Batwings from you, use sneak initially.</I></P>

<P>You say, ‘I seek an ancient type of bowl made by the elves of old.<BR>
Alrik Farsight rummages thriugh his tattered bag and throws aside a towel. ‘To many towels. Oh well, someone told me they were good to 
have once. Here it is, a bowl pattern. Interesting bowl. Looks almost like a magical bowl but I’m np potter. You need it, you say? Well, it is 
interesting. Part of my research here is for the wizard guild in Felwithe. I’m sure they’d put a high price on this one, the enchanters guild 
being so interested in trading for magical paraphernalia and all. Of course if you helped me out on a chore I have, I’d be happy to give it to 
you. I need to deliver an artifact to the guild and I’d much rather stay here exploring. If you wish, you can take the artifact and return with 
the receipt and I will give you the pattern.<BR>
You say, ‘I will take the artifact.'<BR>
Alrik Farsight says ‘Hah! Okay then. Here take this to Farios Elianos in Felwithe. He will give you the Receipt.</P>

<P><I>Alrik Farsight gives you "Crushed Pot" to give to Farios Elianos.</I></P>

Farsight.</I></P>

<P>Farios Elianos says, ‘Why in the nine hells would I need a crushed pot? Perhaps I could use it to not hold water! Why did you 
even bother me with this? Are you mentally deficient? Apparently. Oh, well, you're just a servant boy. Well, then, we'll make you useful, if 
just a little. Take this shopping list and go get my groceries. Take it to Nora in the tavern. She'll know what I need.</P>

<P><I>Farios Elianos givecs you a "Grocery List" to give to Merchant Nora.</I></P>

<P><I>Merchant Nora can be found in one of the shops. Check around town, and you should be able to find her. Give Merchant 
Nora the Grocery List.</I></P>

<P>Merchant Nora says 'You hardly look like the type of errand runner Farios usually sends out to fetch his groceries but here 
they are. I hope he chokes on them. Oh, and tell him he still owes me five gold for his last order!</P>

<P><I>Merchant Nora gives you a "Bag of Provisions" to take to Farios Elianos.</I></P>

<P><I>Go back to Alrik Farsight and give him the Receipt.</I></P>

<P>Alrik Farsight grins happily. 'Excellent! Was he pleased with the artifact? Oh, that's not even worth answering. I'm sure he was. 
He's always happy with the things I send him. That's why he honored me with this position of esteem, searching for useful and powerful 
items in this newly discovered land.'</P>
