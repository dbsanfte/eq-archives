<P><B>Windurst Waters Quests</B></P>

<P><B>A Crisis in the Making</B><BR>
Client: Ranpi-Monpi<BR>
Location: Culinarians' Guild, Windurst Waters [E-8]<BR>
Requirements: none<BR>
Items: Off Offering<BR>
Reward: 400G</P>

<P>In the lower cave section of Giddeus, look for a door around F-7. After going through this door, check the pedistal at the end of the room to find the Off Offering. Once you 
have this, return to Ranpi-Monpi.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>A Pose by Any Other Name</B><BR>
Client: Angelica<BR>
Location: Hostelry Room, Windurst Waters [F-8]<BR>
Items: equipment [based on job]<BR>
Reward: Ancient Blood [furnishing], Angelica's Autograph [key item]<BR>
Title: Super Model</P>

<P>Supposidly Angelica will ask you to wear different clothing depending on what your job is when you talk to her. I did this quest as a red mage and was asked to wear a 
tunic. Regardless of what she asks you to be wearing, chances are that you can find it for sale at the auction house. Just equip it and talk to Angelica a second time.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>In a Pickle</B><BR>
Client: Chamama<BR>
Location: Rarab Tail Hostelry, Windurst Waters [F-0]<BR>
Requirements: none<BR>
Items: Smooth Stone<BR>
Reward: Bone Hairpin</P>

<P>Smooth stones are rare/ex drops from crawlers. When you turn in the stone, she will not always accept it as the size, shape or weight might be wrong thus you need to get 
another smooth stone and try again. When you finally find one that she thinks is good, she will give you a bone hairpin as a reward. Additionally if you talk to her again, she will 
have broken the replacement stone however the reward for getting the right stone will only be 200 gil.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Wondering Minstrel</B><BR>
Client: Jatan-Paratan<BR>
Location: Timbre Timbers, Windurst Waters [F-7]<BR>
Requirements: none<BR>
Items: Rosewood Lumber<BR>
Reward: Faerie Piccolo</P>

<P>This quest requires a lot of fame to just start it, so do not be suprised if you do not get it right away despite it not requiring you to perform a specific quest first. When you 
talk to Jatan-Paratan, he will ask you what you thought of his music. If Jatan-Paratan does not get depressed, talk to him again. [I needed to talk to him twice for it to occur.] 
After he starts acting depressed, talk to the mithra girl walking around inside the tavern.</P>

<P>You will now want to go to the Merry Minstrel Meadhouse in Lower Jeuno and talk to Ruslan. After talking to Ruslan, you will need to buy Rosewood Lumber from either the 
Auction Houes or the Woodcrafter's Guil in San d'Oria. Give the Rosewood Lumber to Jatan-Paratan, and he will give you the Faerie Piccolo.</P>
