<P CLASS="header2">About Crydee: Background History</P>

<P CLASS="text">I was born on March 6th 2000 in the city of Kelethin...<BR>
I realize that this was over a thousand years ago, and that half elves generally don't live that long. But you're not getting something here. My 
mom was a wood elf and dad a half elf. Dad wasn't even half human either. He was about 3/4 elf and 1/4 human. He was very short for a half 
elf, and easily passed for a wood elf. Technically I am more elf than human, but I got my height from my human ancestors, as I stand taller than 
most elves. I may have grown up rather quickly, but I haven't aged much in the last one thousand two hundred years. This is a story of my 
childhood and how I cam to be a ranger.</P>

<P CLASS="text">My parents were hippy druids...<BR>
Before I was born, they spent all their time eating foraged mushrooms and seeking out the realms of the nature gods. They would spend many 
hours each day in treeform as they believed that it would bring them closer to the nature gods. To say the least, I was a major inconvenience 
in their never-ending quest to finds the realms of Tunare and Karana. When I was five years old, I was left in the care of some high elves that 
they knew just so that they could continue their more nomadic pursuits without me getting in the way.</P>

<P CLASS="text">I spent the next few decades in Felwithe, living among the high elves...<BR>
I was grateful for their care and guidance. I was so embarrassed about my hippie parents that I claimed that my high elf guardians were my 
actual parents. They didn't seem to mind this and just assumed that I was adjusting to their lifestyle.</P>

<P CLASS="text">When I became old enough, I was put under the tutelage of Lord Jyleel to become a paladin...<BR>
I was taught the basics of fighting and about Tunare who we all survived. We also spent a lot of time in prayer to her. When were not doing all 
that, we were polishing our armour. It may seem strange, as a journeyman paladin starts with no armour yet as an apprentice we wore it daily. 
School was nothing more than to prepare us for the rigours of life that were to come ahead. Therefore we were given some privileges during this 
period of study and learning. My teacher was always pleased with me and often stated that she wished all her students were like me. None of this 
wasn't meant to be however as my life up to this point was a complete lie.</P>

<P CLASS="text">It was soon found that there was something not quite right about me...<BR>
My friends and I were attacked by roaming orcs while in the forest. This wasn't anything new to us. We were all warned not to wander to far 
from the city as there were dangerous orcs and wolves in the forest. We fought as well as we could, but the odds were against us. The only 
thing we had to our advantage was Lay Hands, which we soon discovered that I lacked the ability to do. Right when one of orcs was about to 
kill me, several wolves showed up and killed it. The remaining orcs were too busy fighting the wolves to bother with us at this point. Several 
wolves surrounded me to provide protection, while another growled and barked at my friends, sending them running to the city. Unfortunately 
though, one of them was a bit slow and the wolves killed him. When the teachers found out, they were confused. Wolves were not known for 
sparing the lives of young paladins, yet alone protecting them. Nobody understood why the wolves helped me. I was grateful for having my life 
spared. Yet the same time was permanently scarred emotionally by what happened.</P>

<P CLASS="text">I became restless at this point in my life...<BR>
I didn't care that I couldn't lay hands. The whole idea of bashing with shields seemed silly. Why not just get another sword or kick your foe really 
hard to do more damage. I no longer wanted to wear the plate armour that they'd make us wear. So hot and heavy. I felt like I was going to 
suffocate in it. All my strength was being wasted by lugging about ridiculously heavy armour. I didn't even bother to clean or polish it any more 
like I should. My armour had gone from being the most pristine to being perpetually scuffed up and dirty. There was a lot of talk with my guardians 
about me not doing things the proper way, but I didn't really pay much attention. Everyone just assumed that I was going through trauma from 
the incident with the wolves. That with enough time it would all pass. It didn't.</P>
