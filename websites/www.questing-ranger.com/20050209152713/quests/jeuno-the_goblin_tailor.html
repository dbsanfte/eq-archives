<P><B>The Goblin Tailor</B><BR>
Client: Guttrix<BR>
Location: Goblins' Goblet [H-10]<BR>
Requirements: none<BR>
Items: Chest Key, Magical Pattern<BR>
Reward: Race Specific Equipment<BR>
Title: Goblin's Exclusive Fashion Manne</P>

<P>Summary: Each week, a different magical patern appears inside a treasure chest somewhere. Give it to Guttrix and he'll reward you.</P>

<P>For this quest, you will want to start by talking to Guttrix to activate the quest. This will ensure that you have the quest active when it is your character's week to do this 
quest. If you talk to Guttrix at any time afterwards, he will tell you which whose week it is. However it is far more effective to use one of the online virtual timers to see when 
your race's week is coming up.</P>

<P>The keys are all lore so you can only have one at a time. You may want to camp at least once of each key ahead of time to ensure that you already have it as it can take 
many hours to get just one key to drop in some cases. To give you an idea, when I precamped keys with some friends. It took us an hour to get the first key then the second 
came five hours later. Once you have a key, all you need to do is go to the appropriate dungeon during your race's week and time then open a chest. The easiest way to 
remember it is that the game week always begins with Firesday and ends with Darksday. So if you precamped your key and have an an approximate idea as to when your week 
is going to be, make sure it is Firesday when you open the chest. The magical pattern is a key item so you can only have one at a time and must get it from the chest yourself. 
[This is done by trading the approriate dungeon key to the chest.]</P>

<P>If you do not get a pattern, you are in the wrong dungeon, it isn't your race's week and/or you do not have the quest active. Any one or a combination of these can cause 
you to not get the pattern and have to spend many more hours recamping the key.</P>

<P>If the chest is opened by someone who correctly does the quest and receives the pattern, respawn somewhere else. I have read that this can be either immediately or up to 
five minutes at most. [I cannot tell you which is accurate as I didn't check.] If it is opened by someone not doing the quest, it will respawn 30 minutes later. Only one chest is 
present in the dungeon at any time. Another thing if have the key are will be ready to open a chest immediately at the start of your week, do not be afraid do a shout asking as 
to its location.</P>

<P>If you want to try to two or more pieces RSE during a single week, it will require some planning ahead. First precamp a key for the dungeon. Secondly set your hope point in 
Lower Jeuno and bring a Warp Scroll [or be willing to Bloodport] if you cannot cast the Warp Spell yourself. After you open the chest, immediately Warp or Bloodport to Jeuno, 
turn in the pattern then take a Chocobo back to the appropriate dungeon. You'll need to try camping another key at this point before you can open another chest.</P>

<P>Finally, these dungeons are not even comparable in difficulty levels.</P>

<P>Gusgen Mines is the absolute easiest. A lot of people go there just for mining and bored miners will often just offer help out key campers. The treaure chests also tend to be 
much closer around each other thus easier to locate. The vast majority of mobs only detect by sound thus if you precamp your keys, you can use sneak [or sneak oil] to explore 
around for the chests. You only need to watch out for bombs and NMs.</P>

<P>Ordelle's Caves is the middle in terms of difficulty. I cannot comment about it as I've only been here a few times for other quests. However mob detection seems to vary a bit 
more than in the Gusgen Mines.</P>

<P>Maze of Shakhrami is the absolute hardest. A lot of mobs detect by sight and rooms tend to be filled with these kinds of mobs. The possible spawn points for treasure chests 
tends to be spread out all over the place thus making it even less fun. If this sounds unappealing, I'd recommend precamping keys for the other two dungeons and forget this 
one.</P>
