<P><B>Windurst Walls Quests</B></P>

<P><B>I Can Hear a Rainbow</B><BR>
Client: ???<BR>
Location: House of the Hero [G-3]<BR>
Requirements: Carbuncle's Ruby, Level 30+<BR>
Reward: Summoner Job, Carbuncle<BR>
Title: Rainbow Weaver</P>

<P>The first thing you need to do for this quest is get the ruby, which is a rare/ex drop off leeches. The leeches that drop them with the highest frequency are the ones in 
Qufim Island. Even then, you'll want to bring as many people as you can with the Treasure Hunter ability. [I had an alliance with seven people, two of which had treasure hunter, 
when I finally got the ruby.] However for these leeches, you'll need to be L45+ if you are trying to do it solo or L30+ with a small group. If these leeches are not an option for 
you, the next best place to go is Burburimu Peninsula. If you do go here instead, you need to bring someone with Treasure Hunter. If you cannot, then you should go level a 
thief to 15 and subjob it. Without having someone there with this ability, I must have spent between 15-20 hours there in total, and did not get the ruby. Once you finally 
have the ruby, you will want to go to the House of the Hero in Windurst Walls. After a brief intermission, you will need to collect the seven colors of the rainbow. While I am 
listing them in their rainbow color order, you can gather the colors in any order.</P>

<P>Red [Hot Spells]<BR>
Recommended Areas: Eastern Altepa Desert<BR>
The Eastern Altepa Desert might be a bit tough to get through at Level 30, but it is very doable if you have a mage job. First you will want to head out to Bastok then enter 
the Zeruhn Mines [which i accessable from either Bastok Mines or Palborough Mines] then head straight through to the Korroloka Tunnel. The route through the Korroloka 
Tunnel is a straight run though, but you will need to have sneak and invisibility up at all times. Once you get to the Eastern Altepa Desert, just around for a hot spell to 
occur if it is not already. Once you see the hot spell, just zone back to the tunnel then to the desert to get the red light.</P>

<P>Orange [Sunshine]<BR>
Recommended Areas: any<BR>
This one should be fairly easy to get as clear sunny skies can occur almost anywhere.</P>

<P>Yellow [Sand Storms]<BR>
Recommended Areas: Valkurm Dunes, Konschtat Highlands<BR>
Sand storms occur frequently in both of these two areas. You can even wait by the zone for these as they are next to each other and move over to the other periodically. 
Though I would recommend spending most of your time in Konschtat Highlands as it can get thunder storms as well.</P>

<P>Green [Wind]<BR>
Recommended Area: La Theine Plateau<BR>
While there are other areas that are just as good, La Theine has several benefits. One being that if  you collected the "hard" ones already, the remaining ones can all be collected 
near by. You can get water as well in La Theine, while Valkurn Dunes has sand storms and Jugner Forest can get thunder.</P>

<P>Blue [Rain]<BR>
Recommended Area: Pashhow Marshlands<BR>
While there are other places that are also good for rain, the Pashhow Marshlands experiences rain far more than any other weather condition to the point that it will most likely 
be raining when you first come in.</P>

<P>Indigo [Snow]<BR>
Recommended Area: Beaucedine Glacier<BR>
This one will seem difficult as you need to navigate your way through Ranguemont Pass and without a map. Unfortunately it is rather easy to walk in circles and hit dead ends. 
If you are doing this at Level 30, you will not need sneak or invisibility right away. Also make sure that you bring a Scroll of Instant Warp because after you pass a paticular point, 
you cannot turn around and go back. At the first intersection in Ranguemont Pass, go right. This will take you to a room with two elvaan in it. Talk to the one in front of a 
pedistal, who will open the door for you. After you go through this door, you will need to cast sneak and invisibility immediately. You can also not go back through the door after 
it closes behind you. Once you are through the door, continue straight ahead. The first intersection [E-9] will have a path leading straight ahead and one to the left. You will 
want to take the one straight ahead which will lead you to a large room. After the large room, you will come to another intersection [G-8] that forces you to go left or right. 
Take a left turn here. From this point onward, just follow the right wall. There will be two more intersections at [G-7] and [L-6] where you can go straight ahead or turn left, 
but you will want to continue straight. The zone to Beaucedine Glacier will be at [L-4]. Apparently it always snows out here, so you will get the indigo light immedately. You'll 
need to activate the Scroll of Instant Warp at this point in order to get back.</P>

<P>Violet [Thunder]<BR>
Recommended Areas: Konschtat Highlands, Pashhow Marshlands<BR>
Another spot to look for thunder is Jugner Forest. However Konschtat and Pashhow are right next to each other thus allowing you to wait by the boundry and periodically check 
the other area.</P>

<P>After you have obtained all colors of the rainbow, Carbuncle will appear briefly and ask you to meet him in La Theine Plateau. Head to [G-6] and trade the Ruby to the "???" 
spot on the ground for the Summoner job and the ability to summon Carbuncle.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Star Struct</B><BR>
Client: Koru-Moru<BR>
Location: Manor [E-7]<BR>
Requirements: The Postman Always K.O.s Twice<BR>
Items: Meteorite<BR>
Reward: Compound Eye Circleta</P>

<P>Metorites are rare/ex drops from crawlers. The dop rate for them is a lot rarer than everything else that can drop from crawlers. You may want to consider just buying the 
Compound Eye Circlet if you are not killing these mobs for some other reason.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>The Postman Always K.O.s Twice</B><BR>
Client: Ambrosius<BR>
Location: Auction House [J-12]<BR>
Items: Damp Envelope, Muddy Bar Tab, Old Postcard or Torn Epistle<BR>
Reward: 50-500G depening on the number of cards turned in</P>

<P>More than likely if you are killing newbie mobs around Windurst for other quest drops or experience, you will run into some of the mail. Otherwise it isn't worth it to kill them 
just for this quest.</P>
