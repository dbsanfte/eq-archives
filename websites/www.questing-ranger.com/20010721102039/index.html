<P CLASS="header2">News</P>

<P CLASS="header1">July 15, 2001 [B]</P>
<P CLASS="text">Lots of more pictures of epic weapons, npcs and mobs have been added. Most notably though is that I have finally added 
<a href="#" onClick="window.open('epics/mobs/m-vs.html','mob','menubar=no,WIDTH=620,HEIGHT=500'); return false;">Venril Sathir</A> 
himself to my collection!</P>

<P CLASS="header1">July 15, 2001</P>
<P CLASS="text">I just finished re-uploading everything for the desired changes to occur. Due to the time, I have yet to run a thorough site 
check, which I plan to do later today. More epic stuff have been added.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">July 14, 2001</P>
<P CLASS="text">I am making some optimization changes starting today. The site will be much friendlier to those running at the 800x600 
resolution.</P>

<P CLASS='header1">July 7, 2001</P>
<P CLASS="text">Just a quick minor update today. I added more NPCs to the list in the epic weapons secion. Once I get them all added, I'll put 
some time into researching their faction. I just finished the quest for the Star of Eyes, which has infinate charges of Identify. I'll add this quest 
with tomorrow's update.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">July 2, 2001 [B]</P>
<P CLASS="text">Found that two of my screen shots are completely missing. *cries* Good news though, I found a ranger epic shot that I had 
not uploated yet, which I've done so just now. I've also made updates to the Shaman Epic quest as the Iksar Child is not called an Iksar Broodling. 
The links page was also updated today. It's getting really late now, so no more updates today.</P>

<P CLASS="header1">July 2, 2001</P>
<P CLASS="text">Some fixes were done to the Epic Weapons page. I had to restore one picture from backup and fixed a few pages that 
were not loading. Two of the new weapon pictures are not loading still and need to be reuploaded later this evening when I get home as 
I'm doing this fix from work. Note to self - always check everything, ESPECIALLY when doing late night updates while sleepy! Uber thanks 
to Deidda Proudfoot and *hugs* for emailing me about the corrections that needed to be made. Most likely I wouldn't have caught it 
myself for at least a few more days.</P>
