<P><B>A Squire's Test</B><BR>
Client: Balasiel<BR>
Location: Watchdog Alley, South San d'Oria [F-7]<BR>
Item: Revival Root<BR>
Reward: Spatha<BR>
Title: Knight in Training</P>

<P>Summary: Obtain a revival tree root from King Ranperre's Tomb.</P>

<P>This is the first of three quests that must be completed in order to eventually unlock the paladin job. While the quest specifies King Ranperre's Tomb, the root is a rare drop 
off any undead anywhere. [I got mine from a Tainted Hound in Konschtat Highlands.] They call also be purchased at the auction house under Alchemy Materials.</P>

<P><B>A Squire's Test II</B><BR>
Client: Balasiel<BR>
Location: Watchdog Alley, South San d'Oria [F-7]<BR>
Requirements: A Squire's Test<BR>
Item: Stalactite Dew<BR>
Reward: Squire's Certificate<BR>
Title: Spelunker</P>

<P>Summary: Journey to the aterfall in Ordelle's Caves, and bring back proof of your visit.</P>

<P>If you talk to Chanpau, near Balasiel, he'll suggest that you bring back stalactite dew. You'll want to go to the Cathedral in North San d'Oria at this point to talk to Morjean 
to learn how to get it. At this point you will want to head to Ordelle's Caves. In the first room, you will want to follow the winding path that is towards the right until you come 
to a room with a bunch of Fungars. There are a bunch of them and they will agro even at L30, even though most of the stuff in the cave will not at this point. I used Sneak, 
buch if you are not playing a mage class you will need either items that will give you this ability or maybe a few friends to help you clear through them.</P>

<P>There are now two paths that you can take. If you have a map, take the one that doesn't lead towards La Theine to get to the room with a pool of water. Make sure that 
sneak is still up as there are more fungars here also. You'll want to get close to the water to touch it, then check the stalactites in the room that are a bit away from the pool. 
One of them will be targetable and if you are fast enough, you will get the dew after having touched the water. Once you have the dew, just bring it back to Balasiel.</P>

<P><B>A Knight's Test</B><BR>
Client: Balasiel<BR>
Location: Watchdog Alley, South San d'Oria [F-7]<BR>
Requirements: A Squire's Test II, Level 30+<BR>
Items: Book of Tactics, Book of the West, Book of the East, Knight's Soul<BR>
Reward: Kite Shield, Paladin Job<BR>
Title: Tried and Tested Knight</P>

<P>Summary: Solve the riddle of the task book.</P>

<P>At this point, you will want to talk to the guards in the towers overlooking Victory Square in South San d'Oria. You can find the entrance to the East Tower at [L-8], where 
you will talk to Cahaurme for the Book of the East. The entrance for the West Tower is at [G-9], which leads to Baurise, who gives you the Book of the West. The guards may 
be talked to in either order.</P>

<P>Once this is done, you need to head to E-10 in Davoi. Having the map for this area will help a lot as you will need to walk through some water. If you are doing this solo, 
keep invisibility up at all times as all orcs and pugil will agro. Around the well itself, you may see a slim type mob. This will detect by sound or smell but not sight. If there is no 
orc nearby, find a good spot to put up these two buffs then head for the well to get the Knight's Soul. If there is an orc around the well in addition to the slime, you may want 
to try waiting for the orc to look the other way to drop invisibility or even eat a death to get the key item. Regardless of how you get it, return to Balasiel afterwards to get a 
Kite Shield and the ability to select the paladin job.</P>
