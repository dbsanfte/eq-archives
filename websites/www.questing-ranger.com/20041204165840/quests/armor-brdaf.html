<P><B>Bard Artifact Armor Quests</B></P>

<P><B>Painful Memory</B> [Bard AF1]<BR>
Client: Mertaire<BR>
Location: Merry Minstrel Meadhouse, Lower Jeuno [I-8]<BR>
Requirements: Level 40+ Bard<BR>
Reward: Paper Knife</P>

<P>Mertaire wants your help disposing of a ring, which has painful memories of his lost love, so he cannot bring himself to do it himself. The spot he has chosen is a pool of water 
inside Rangemont Pass. However this is not as easy as it sounds as you will encounter a notorious monster, so gather a party then head to Rangemont Pass, then go to [D-5] to 
get to the pool of water.</P>

<P>Clicking on the "???" spot at the water will spawn the notorious monster Tros. Both Barwatera and Water Carol will help due the the water-based AE that he does. Once Tros is 
dead, inspect the "???" again. Mertaire will show up as he realised he should throw the ring in the water himself and gives you the Paper Knife as thanks for your help.</P>

<P><B>The Requiem</B> [Bard AF2]<BR>
Client: Bki Tbujhja<BR>
Location: Merry Minstrel Meadhouse [I-8]<BR>
Requirements: Painful Memory, Level 50+ Bard<BR>
Reward: Choral Slippers</P>

<P>Talk to Bki Tbujhja, and she tells you of a ritual performed by the bards of the tavern where a bard makes a journey to Eldieme Necropolis to pay respects to a bard that was 
burried there. Before you go, she wants you to get some Holy Water [which can be made through alchemy or purchased at the auction house under medicines.] Talk to Bki 
Tbujhaja again with the Holy Water in your inventory.</P>

<P>You'll now need an alliance. The amount of people you need will vary depending on the levels you bring. The best advise I can give you is don't make the mistake of thinking 
that one or two L70+ friends will guarantee you a win. The boss can do an AE sleep, which caused my party to fail when everyone was put to sleep but the tank who could not 
cast spells. [To make matters worse, we stayed asleep then entire time as the tank was killed off.] If you do go with a non-casting tank, give him a few potions to wake a healer 
up. ^^</P>

<P>You'll now want to go to Eldieme Necropolis, but must go to the area which requires you to travel to Beaudice Glacier. Once inside Eldieme Necropolis, sneak your way to 
[D-4] and clear all the mobs in the room. Have your party or alliance wait in the coridor just outside the room, with mages standing a bit further away to avoid that sleep I 
mentioned. When you are ready for the boss, put sneak up again then inspect all the coffins in the room until three NMs spawn. You only need to kill the Owl Guard to pass this, 
but this depends on if you manage to pull him by himself.</P>

<P>With this mob [or all three] dead, inspect the same coffin that spawned the NMs. You'll see a brief intermission where the ghost of a bard appears and gives you a Star Ring. 
Return to the Merry Minstrel Meadhouse and talk to Bki Tbujhja again. She doesn't know anything about the ghost, but gives you Choral Slippers.</P>

<P><B>Crawler's Nest Coffer</B><BR>
Requirements: Painful Memory, Level 50+ Bard<BR>
Reward: Choral Roundlet</P>

<P>For this you just need to find a Nest Coffer Key, then trade it to any Treasure Coffer that appears in the zone. The key itself drops off of Helm Beetles, which you can exp off 
of after level 50. The coffer itself can be tricky. If you do not luck hour and have the coffer spawn next to where you are exping it, you will want to print out a map. Sometimes 
this coffer gets opened immediately but more likely than not, the coffer sits there for hours until someone gets around to opening it. You will have better luck if you roam around 
the zone seeking the coffer by yourself or with a few friends. In the two lower areas, just about everything agros. Crawerlers and Exorays detect by sound. Other mobs detect 
by sight.</P>

<P><B>Castle Oztroja Coffer</B><BR>
Requirements: Painful Memory, Level 50+ Bard<BR>
Reward: Choral Cannions</P>

<P>For this you need to get an Oztroja Coffer Key, which drops off the higher level Yagudo that are just outside the room which you enter as part of the third limit break quest. 
This mobs also can drop testimonies, so you may get the Bard Testimony [for the fifth limit break quest] at the same time as well as some of the songs in the L50-60 range from 
the Yagudo Conductor. However the testimony is extremely rare, and I didn't see it drop once out of the two times I went there. This part can be easy or hard depending on your 
party/alliance.</P>

<P>Once you have this coffer key, the best thing to do is to just camp the coffer is inside the genkai 3 room. [If you use the maps I linked to below, this is the red dot that is off 
the map area on Map 4.] This room is a "safe area" where Yagudo do not spawn at, so you can just wait for it to spawn. Due to the value of Astral Rings, which also come from 
coffers in this zone, the Treasure Coffer does got opened often and regularly making waiting for the coffer in the one safe place a viable option.</P>

<P><B>The Circle of Time</B> [Bard AF3]<BR>
Client: Imasuke<BR>
Location: Qufim Tunnel [E-6]<BR>
Requirements: The Requiem<BR>
Reward: Choral Justacorps</P>

<P>Imasuke shows interest in the Star Ring [key item] that you obtained from the spirit towards the end of "The Requiem." However the writing on it cannot be read due to years 
of dirt and grime on t. You'll need to take the ring to Xarcabard and bury it in the Perennial Snow at [I-10.] There are several high level mobs in this tunnel, but you can sneak 
past them easily. You'll now need to wait until the next real life day to dig it out. Once you have the ring back, return to Imasuke and talk to him again. He cannot read the 
writing on the ring, but recognizes it as being Elvaan.</P>

<P>At this point, you will need to go to Chateau d'Oraguille in San d'Oria to speak to Chalvatot, who can be found in the garden. He tells you a story that many years ago a bard 
came to San d'Oria. The king liked the bard for his singing, and the queen feel in love with him. The queen and the bard had a pair of rings made proclaiming their love for each 
other and that they would be together in the next life. He gives you a Moon Ring [key item,] and asks that you take both rings to the alter in Monastic Cavern as the queen 
would have liked both rings to be together.</P>

<P>At this point, you'll now need to get ready for a Boss Fight with the notorious monster Bugaboo. The alliance I went with for this consisted of two parties, most were around 
level 60, with only one or two in the 70s. The fight is not paticularly difficult, but you probably should bring a third party if your levels are a bit lower. This notorious monster is 
weak to fire and light magic, and strong againt ice [it's actual element] and wind [which is weak to ice.]</P>

<P>Once your alliance is ready, head to Davoi. There are multiple entrances to the Monastic Cavern. The one you want is located towards the south end of the zone at H-11. 
The orcs inside the Monastic Cavern are much stronger than those outside and you will want to you Invisible to get your alliance around. Head to J-8, where you will find an 
alter. Clear out all orcs that are around the alter, then click on the alter to spawn Bugaboo. Once Bugaboo is out of the way, click on the alter again for a brief intermission of 
you placing the two rings at the alter.</P>

<P>Return to Chalvatot [in Chateau d'Oraguille] and talk to him again. You'll see the spirits of the late queen and the bard appear, then walk off together. Chalvatot gives you 
the Choral Justacorps as thanks for helping the late queen.</P>

<P><B>Borghertz's Harmonious Hands</B><BR>
Client: Guslam<BR>
Location: Durable Shields [H-8]<BR>
Requirements: started The Requiem<BR>
Reward: Choral Cuffs</P>

<P>Talk to Guslam, who will talk of Borghertz and how great his work was. You will now need at minimum a party. [For this part, I had went with an alliance that was going after 
coffers ad skill ups.] Head to Castle Zvahl to where the Ahrimans spawn and kill them to get the Coffer Key. The coffer itself can spawn in the same area where these mobs 
spawn. You will most likely need a party to get to the coffer as mobs spawn all around the area. [I lucked out and we found it after I got the key.] Once you open the coffer, 
you will get the Old Gauntlets [key item.] Return to Upper Jeuno and talk to Guslam again. He will recognize them as being the work of Borghertz, but cannot repair them. [If you 
use the below map links, the area where I got the Key and the Coffer were on Map 3 for Castle Zvahl Baileys.]</P>

<P>Head to the Tenshodo, located in Lower Jeuno to talk to Yin Pocanakhu. Agree to pay her 1,000G. She will tell you the location of the toolbox that cannot be opened. Head 
to Port Jeuno and go downstairs to the lower dock. Examine the "???" spot on some crates. The ghost of Borghertz will show up and ask if you wish to make a deal. Agree and he 
will tell you to leave the Old Gauntlets and some Shadow Flames at the toolbox.</P>

<P>Shadow Flames come from the notorious monster Dark Spark. You'll need a full party for this. Once you have a party, head to Castle Zvahl Baileys. You'll need to keep sneak 
and invisible up and work your way to F-8 to where there are four torches. [Located on Map 1 for Castle Zvahl Baileys.] Do not get close to the edges here as it can cause you 
to agro a bunch of mobs that are below. Clear out all the demons in the area around the torches, then have one person in your party click on one torch to spawn Dark Spark, 
which is a bomb-type NM. Once Dark Spark is dead, have everyone click on the same torch that was used to spawn Dark Spark and each party member will be able to get the 
Shadow Flames.</P>

<P>Return to Port Jeuno to the crates and examine the "???" again. You'll see a brief intermission where Borghertz shows up and restore the gloves for you.</P>
