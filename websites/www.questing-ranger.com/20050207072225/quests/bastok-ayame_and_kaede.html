<P><B>Ayame and Kaede</B><BR>
Client: Ensetsu<BR>
Location: Hose, Port Bastok [I-5]<BR>
Requirements: Level 30+, Tenshodo Membership<BR>
Items: Strangely-Shapped Coral, Sealed Dagger [key items]<BR>
Reward: Ninja Job<BR>
Title: Shadow Walker</P>

<P>Summary: Ensetsu wishes to reclaim an item he has sold ot the Tenshodo, but they will not exchange it for anything other than a "strangely shapped coral" from the 
Korroloka Tunnel. You must go and retrieve it for him.</P>

<P>This quest starts by talking to Kaede, who is in the same house as Ensetsu. After you talk to her, talk to Ensetsu. At this point, you are ready for the leech fight in the 
Korroloka Tunnel. To get there, enter from Bastok side then go straight ahead until you reach [K-8] then turn left. Continue along until you come to a bridge at [G-9] then 
cross over it. After you cross the bridge, go left until you reach another junction at [D-8]. You will want to go right here. Just follow the path from here until you get to [H-8] 
then go left. Enter the cave to the left at [F-9] then follow the patch straight ahead and dont cross the bridge. Continue to follow the patch until you reach [H-11] and go 
right. Keep going straight and cross the next bridge. Continue on then go right at [H-8], and right again at [I-7]. Just follow the path from here and there will be a "???" at the 
end of it at [K-8]. Also at some point in here, you will start to see jellies along the path, which you can get buy with Sneak. After the jellies it will appear to be clear a bit, but 
you will run into Bogies. Sneak will get you past these also. Additionally be very careful not to fall off the bridges as you pretty much will die if Sneak and Invisible both are not 
up due to the high level mobs down below.</P>

<P>Clear out all nearby leeches before triggering the fight as they will link with the ones you are fighting and agro on you. Once your party is ready for the actual fight, have the 
person that you want to tank investigate the ??? spot to trigger the leeches. If possible, you should have someone sleep or lullaby two of them. This fight can be hard but is not 
nearly as hard as everyone makes it out to be. Once all three leeches are dead, investigate the "???" spot a second time to get the Strangely-Shapped Coral.</P>

<P>You will now want to go back to Port Bastok and talk to Ensetsu again. He will want you to deliver the coral for him to Norg. While I don't have directions for getting there, 
you can ride a chocobo to Sea Serpent Grotto, which will get you there safely. Once inside Sea Serpent Grotto, you will want to have Sneak up constantly. At this point, just 
follow the path straight ahead until you reach a point that you have to turn left or right. Go right and there will be an unmarked door. Click on the door to open it then go 
straight ahead from here to get to Norg.</P>

<P>Inside Norg, talk to Ryoma, who you will find near the dock. Once this is done, return to Port Bastok and talk to Ensetsu for the ninja job.</P>
