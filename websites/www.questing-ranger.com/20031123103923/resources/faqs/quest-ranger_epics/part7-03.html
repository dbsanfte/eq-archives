<P>Swiftwind and Earthcaller: Walkthrough Part 7 - The Ancient Longsword</P>

<P><B>Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle, Kunark</B></P>

<P><I>If the normal spawned version of Venril Sathir is up, he must be killed as both versions of Venril Sathir cannot be up at the same
time. Venril Sathirs remains will spawn randomly after Venril Sathir dies. Venril Sathirs remains spawn in the "setup" room before Venril
Sathir's lair.</I></P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
Do not proceed with this part until you are ready to deal with (fight) Venril Sathir, who will spawn. If you fail to kill Venril Sathir, you will
have to redo this part. You will need a Summoned: Firefly Globe and scroll for
"<A href="javascript:popupOldInventory('spell_resurrection')">Spell: Resurrection</A>" to complete this sequence. Venril Sathir will drop two
Pulsing Green Stones and nothing else.</P>

<P>Venril Sathirs remains says 'The living fire. I seek the fires of life. Bring them.</P>

<P>Use the spell Dance of the Fireflies to summon a Firefly Globe which identifies as
"<A href="javascript:popupOldInventory('summoned_firefly_globe')">Summoned: Firefly Globe</A>." This can only be done during the evening
in Norrath and can also be done ahead of time.</P>

<P>*Give Venril Sathirs remains the Firefly Globe.*<BR>
Venril Sathirs remains grasps the glowing sphere of fireflies from your hands. Tendrils of mystical energy begin to flow forth from the swarm
of glowing insects like tiny fingers. The glowing tendrils begin to reach into the ribcage of the rotting remains of Venril Sathir, coalescing
into the form of an iksar ghost.</P>

<P><I>Venril Sathirs remains despawn and the Spirit of Venril Sathir spawns immediately. He will be located wherever Venril Sathirs remains
was at when you turned in the Firefly Globe.</I></P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
Do not proceed with this part until you are ready to deal with (fight) Venril Sathir, who will spawn. If you fail to kill Venril Sathir, you will
have to redo this part.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Spirit of Venril Sathir'<BR>
Spirit of Venril Sathir says 'So mortals, you seek to end the tainting of Tunare's children? So be it, I have no cares. My death has been
caused by this foolishness and I want no more to do with it. Bring me a scroll with the knowledge of resurrection so that I may once again
live. I will hand you that which you seek.</P>

<P><I>If you do not already have it with you, you will need a copy of the spell Resurrection, which can be obtained from most cleric
guilds.</I></P>

<P>*Give the Spirit of Venril Sathir the Level 49 Cleric Resurrection spell.*<BR>
Spirit of Venril Sathir says 'I am alive! My thanks to you. And now I will aid you in your quest for preserving the forests of norrath. Your
carcass will help nurture the soils of the wilderness.</P>

<P>Venril Sathir spawns. Kill Venril Sathir to get the "<A href="javascript:popupOldInventory('pulsing_green_stone')">Pulsing Green Stone</A>" which will be used to get the Warmly Glowing Stone.</P>

<P>Venril Sathir<BR>
Level: 55<BR>
Class: Necromancer<BR>
Just because the triggered version of Venril Sathir is easier, does not mean you should slack off. He will still can and will Lifetap although it
will not occur as often as with the normal version.</P>

<P>Camp Setup - Standard:<BR>
The standard camp setup is to clear the all the additional mobs that spawn around the setup area, then spawn Venril Sathir in the setup
area when you are ready to fight him.</P>

<P>Camp Setup - Alternate (Zone In):<BR>
An alternate method would be to stand on the platform area above Venril Sathirs remains, cast Cinder Jolt on him then pull him to the
zone. When you get Vernil Sathirs remains to the zone area, zone out to dump agro and keep hailing him after zoning back in. After your
forces have arrived and area ready, you can trigger him at the zone area. I only recommend using this method during off hours when
virtually nobody is in the zone. [Should there be some other people in the zone, be sure to warn them just in case they decide to leave
around the time that you start.] One thing to keep in mind with this camp setup is that is not viable on all servers. The politics on some
servers are such that this method is not acceptable under any circumstances, even if the people you bring to fight are the only ones in
the zone. On such servers, you can expect other people to make attempts to ruin your raid should you be seen doing this. Know your
server environment before using non-standard methods.</P>

<P>Tactics:<BR>
For fighting Venril Sathir, my best advise is to use the same tactics that you would use for the full-strenght non-triggered version.
General strategy involves having enchanters cast rune on everyone, then people call out when it drops. Using a "Main Tank" approach
is best here where you rune one warrior who engages first and tries to hold agro for the entire fight then everyone joins in afterwards.
Clerics concentrate their heals to keeping this warrior alive, who holds the agro. Everyone else needs to make sure that they do no draw
agro no matter what. Should the main tank drop, it will be necessary for everyone to stop fighting while the next tank establishes agro.</P>
