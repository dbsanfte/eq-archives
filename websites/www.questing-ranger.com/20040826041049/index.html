<P><B>Elements:</B> Because these get referanced a lot on this site, it does help to know them. Rather than put a quick-referance chart to elements on every page where 
the icons are used... which would just be overkill, I'm placing here here. If you need to get back to this page at any time, click on "home" from the top menu.</P>

<P><B>Site Updates</B></P>

<P>08-11-2004: I broke down the "bards" section as it was getting a bit too generalized. Songs and spells were moved to the "magic" section, and equipment to "equipment." 
Everything else was sent to "extras" which is just my general catch-all area. Information "guilds" section was a bit too space to warrant it having its own area, so this area 
was removed and everything was relocated to extras. Oh, I've also added some new stuff to the magic and equipment areas. =)</P>

<P>08-08-2004: Minor update today, just a few more artifact armor pictures, added Mean Machine Quest and some more subjob spells in the Bard section... was up late getting 
the white mage job up to L25 or would probably be more.</P>

<P>08-07-2004: Added "Trouble at the Sluice" to the quest area under North San d'Oria.  I've also updated the header graphics on the site to fit better with the modified color 
scheme.</P>

<P>08-03-2004: Added "The Rumor" to the questing area. This appears in the newly added subarea for Bostaunieux Oubliette quests as well as to the existing page for 
spell-related quests.</P>

<P>08-02-2004: <A HREF="/gallery/event-summerfest2004.html"> Goldfish Scooping</A> appeared a few days ago. New screen shots have been added for Gusgen Mines, 
Rampaging Ram, the Summerfest event and some artifcat armor. I also saw Jolly Green yesterday, but forgot to take a screen shot. =( It looks just like a Goobbue though [see 
the misc gallery if you don't know what a Goobbue looks like.] Some other guy in the area didn't approve of my group farming techniques... <I>Hey, I'm a bard. You actually 
expect me to solo this stuff????</I> There was also a ballisa going on in the area: San d'Oria [winner] versus Windurst. I've also updated the quest section to include Ayame and 
Kaede [Ninja Job Quest] and Only The Best, which is a nice quest to earn fame in San d'Oria, Bastok and Jeuno all at the same time.</P>

<P>07-29-2004: I've removed the "Summerfest 2004" link on this page as well as some old update notices. The "print" link on the menu header was removed as I felt that it was 
needlessly enlarging the file sizes thus causing the site to load slower in the long run. I've also added a link back to this page on all pages of the site. Additionally the color 
scheme has been modified slightly to appear more bright and cheerful... I felt that the dark background was starting to look a bit gloomy. Some other things have also been 
moved around... the spells and equipment were relocated to the new "bards" section. I've also added a section for guilds as I felt that I wanted to do more with it. There's also 
a few completely new things in the extras section.</P>

<P>07-28-2004: No major updates lately. Between Summerfest and farming gil, I have not done much of anything new. Still no sign of "Goldfish Scooping" anywhere within FFXI. 
=( Click on the Summerfest banner below to go straight to the summerfest page, which features both screen shots and quests for this special event. Because these quests are 
for a limited time, I most likely will not be adding them to the main quest area.</P>

<P>07-23-2004: Added sections to the gallery for artifact armor and regions. I've also added a section for random miscellaneous images that do not fit into any of the other 
categories.</P>

<P>07-22-2004: Added two new subsections to the gallery area. One for pictues of Notorious Monsters and the other for Summoner Aeons. These two sections are complete for 
the time being until I take more screen shots.</P>

<P>07-20-2004: Several more quests were added - <A HREF="/quests/jeuno-upper.html">A Candlelight Vigil</A>, 
<A HREF="quests/sandoria-port.html">A Job for the Consortium</A>, <A HREF="/quests/jeuno-upper.html">Candle Making</A> and 
<A HREF="/quests/jeuno-lower.html">The Goblin Tailor</A>. I've also updated the walkthrough for <A HREF="/quests/town-selbina.html">An Explorer's Footsteps</A>, which 
rewards you with the Map of Crawler's Nest.</P>

<P>07-19-2004: Extras section was added.</P>

<P>07-17-2004: Some changes were made to the equipment section. I still want to add images, but the factual data is at least complete for now.</P>

<P>07-08-2004: I got two more of the stone monuments for the Crawler's Nest Map quest [under Selbina quests] and rearanged the order that they are listed to be in 
chronological order according to the date on the monuments. I also added the second mog house upgrade quest as well as the summoner job quest. Other than getting 
Carbuncle's Ruby, which is just rare in a very lame and extremely tedious way [which doesn't make it hard just lame and tedious] - this job quest has been very very easy.</P>

<P>07-07-2004: EverQuest faqs have been moved off site. Akanesotome Asha`man has kindly given some space for them thus you can now access them all at the following 
URL: <A HREF="http://www.thefellowshipquests.com/ranger/">http://www.thefellowshipquests.com/ranger/</A>. As for my site, you'll notice that I've added a new section 
called "regions" which is still being worked on.</P>
