<P><B>Port Bastok Quests</B></P>

<P><B>A Discerning Eye (Bastok)</B><BR>
Client: Grin<BR>
Location: Airship Dock [G-7]<BR>
Requirements: Rank 5<BR>
Items: Dropped Item<BR>
Reward: 500G<BR>
Title: Discerning Individual</P>

<P>For these quests, you will be shown what the passanger looks like after you agree to deliver the dropped item. This is the only time you will be shown what the actual 
passanger looks like, so the most successful way to do this that I have found is to make note of the following: race, gender, hair color, hair style, head equipment, body 
equipment, hands equipment, legs equipment and feet equipment. If you give the item to the correct passanger, you will gain 500 gil, which more than covers the cost of the 
flight itself. Also if you have completed all other Discerning Eye quests, you will get the title "Very Discerning Individual" instead.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>A Foreman's Best Friend</B><BR>
Client: Gudav<BR>
Location: Construction Site [H-5]<BR>
Items: Dog Collar<BR>
Reward: Map of Gusgen Mines</P>

<P>The Dog Collar drops from a Black Wolves that spawn in North Gustaberg at night time. It can also be purchased at the Auction House under Armor then Neck. Once you 
have the Dog Collar, just give it to Gudav to get the map.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Ayame and Kaede</B><BR>
Client: Ensetsu<BR>
Location: Hose [I-5]<BR>
Items: Strangely-Shapped Coral, Sealed Dagger [key items]<BR>
Reward: Ninja Job<BR>
Title: Shadow Walker</P>

<P>This quest starts by talking to Kaede, who is in the same house as Ensetsu. After you talk to her, talk to Ensetsu. At this point, you are ready for the leech fight in the 
Korroloka Tunnel. To get there, enter from Bastok side then go straight ahead until you reach [K-8] then turn left. Continue along until you come to a bridge at [G-9] then 
cross over it. After you cross the bridge, go left until you reach another junction at [D-8]. You will want to go right here. Just follow the path from here until you get to [H-8] 
then go left. Enter the cave to the left at [F-9] then follow the patch straight ahead and dont cross the bridge. Continue to follow the patch until you reach [H-11] and go 
right. Keep going straight and cross the next bridge. Continue on then go right at [H-8], and right again at [I-7]. Just follow the path from here and there will be a "???" at the 
end of it at [K-8]. Also at some point in here, you will start to see jellies along the path, which you can get buy with Sneak. After the jellies it will appear to be clear a bit, but 
you will run into Bogies. Sneak will get you past these also. Additionally be very careful not to fall off the bridges as you pretty much will die if Sneak and Invisible both are not 
up due to the high level mobs down below.</P>

<P>Clear out all nearby leeches before triggering the fight as they will link with the ones you are fighting and agro on you. Once your party is ready for the actual fight, have the 
person that you want to tank investigate the ??? spot to trigger the leeches. If possible, you should have someone sleep or lullaby two of them. This fight can be hard but is not 
nearly as hard as everyone makes it out to be. Once all three leeches are dead, investigate the "???" spot a second time to get the Strangely-Shapped Coral.</P>

<P>You will now want to go back to Port Bastok and talk to Ensetsu again. He will want you to deliver the coral for him to Norg. While I don't have directions for getting there, 
you can ride a chocobo to Sea Serpent Grotto, which will get you there safely. Once inside Sea Serpent Grotto, you will want to have Sneak up constantly. At this point, just 
follow the path straight ahead until you reach a point that you have to turn left or right. Go right and there will be an unmarked door. Click on the door to open it then go 
straight ahead from here to get to Norg.</P>

<P>Inside Norg, talk to Ryoma, who you will find near the dock. Once this is done, return to Port Bastok and talk to Ensetsu for the ninja job.</P>

Client: Talib<BR>
Location: Tenshodo Warehouse [F-6]<BR>
Requirements: Beauty and the Galka<BR>
Items: 4 Zinc Ore<BR>
Reward: 350G</P>

<P>Zinc ore drops randomly off any worm type mob. While you can also buy it at the auction house, it will cost you more for each ore than you would receive in gil for completing 
this quest. This quest is one of the few that gives fame for the Tenshodo and Norg.</P>
