<P><B>Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket, Antonica</B></P>

<P><I>Give Ella Foodcrafter the Hardened Mixture and the Runecrested Bowl.</I></P>

<P>Ella Foodcrafter smiles slowly as she works the mixture in the bowl and it starts to shine with power. 'This is... a piece of a lost magic 
item known as Nature's Gem. When restored to completeness I've heard its healing powers will be extraodrinary. Take it now. I will take the 
bowl and hopefully do some good from my end. From here, you can go many ways but I can't guide your path step by step. The only advise 
I can give you is to look for ones such as yourself.'</P>

<P><I>Ella Foodcrafter gives you the "Softly Glowing Stone," which identifies as Left Half of Natures Balance.</I></P>

<P><B>Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie, Kunark</B></P>

<P>You say, 'are you one such as myself?'<BR>
Foloal Stormforest stares at you and whispers. 'You must be the one that has been spoken of. Yes, yes I am one of the circle. There are 
many of us in the lands right now, all seeking answers to the ills that have befallen our homes.'<BR>
You say, 'what answers?'<BR>
Foloal Stormforest says 'I have heard whispers of new Iksar movements in the land. The name of Venril Sathir is on the scaled lips and sharp 
tongues of every cold blooded lizard in this place.'<BR>
You say, 'what about venril sathir?'<BR>
Foloal Stormforest says 'All I've heard are whispers of connections between the undead lizards and the dark god of hate. There's some kind 
of history behind the two. It might be that Venril is the main focus of Innoruuk's will in the land. Then again, maybe not, but this is the best 
we've gotten so far. If you think you can do it, then find him and remove him from the face of this earth. Bring me the half of the stone I 
know you have and whatever conduit of power you find on his rotting corpse.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle, Kunark</B></P>

<P><I>If the normal spawned version of Venril Sathir is up, he must be killed. This causes Venril Sathirs remains to spawn. The Venril Sathir 
remains will spawn randomly after Venril Sathir dies.</I></P>

<P>Venril Sathirs remains says 'The living fire. I seek the fires of life. Bring them.</P>

<P><I>Use the spell Dance of the Fireflies to summon a Firefly Globe. Give Venril Sathirs remains the Firefly Globe, which causes the Spirit 
of Venril Sathir to spawn.</I></P>

<P>Venril Sathirs remains grasps the glowing sphere of fireflies from your hands. Tendrils of mystical energy begin to flow forth from the 
swarm of glowing insects like tiny fingers. The glowing tendrils begin to reach into the ribcage of the rotting remains of Venril Sathir, 
coalescing into the form of an iksar ghost.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Spirit of Venril Sathir'<BR>
Spirit of Venril Sathir says 'So mortals, you seek to end the tainting of Tunare's children? So be it, I have no cares. My death has been 
caused by this foolishness and I want no more to do with it. Bring me a scroll with the knowledge of resurrection so that I may once again 
live. I will hand you that which you seek.</P>

<P><I>Give the Spirit of Venril Sathir the Level 49 Cleric Resurrection spell.</I></P>

<P>Spirit of Venril Sathir says 'I am alive! My thanks to you. And now I will aid you in your quest for preserving the forests of norrath. Your 
carcass will help nurture the soils of the wilderness.</P>

<P><I>Venril Sathir respawns. Kill Venril Sathir to get the "Pusling Green Stone," which identifies as Pulsing with a sickly light. This version 
of Venril Sathir should be easier to kill as I have been told that he does not Lifetap. He will drop two Pusling Green Stones and nothing 
else.</I></P>

<P><I>NOTE: There is an alternate method of obtaining the Pulsing Green Stone. The alternate method requires you to go to Howling 
Stones, kill Drucilla Sathir for the Phalactery, and give this item to Venril Sathirs remains. The remains will give you one Pulsing Green 
Stone and despawn. Since Drucilla Sathir is harder to kill than the spawned version of Venril Sathir, you might want to just kill Venril 
Sathir anyway.</I></P>

<HR>

<P><B>Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie, Kunark</B></P>

<P><I>Give Foloal Stormforest the Softly Glowing Stone and the Pusling Green Stone.</I></P>

<P>Foloal Stormforest blinks and carefully takes the stones from you, cautiously scratching the jagged green stone against the other. Its 
skin seems to shiver and flake at the contact and eventually begins to shine brightly. 'With the gem nature's balance is complete. Take the 
stone and walk your path. Blade or lightning caller, burning sword or the mother's walk.'</P>

<P><I>Foloal Stormforest gives you the "Warmly Glowing Stone," that identifies as Natures Balance Completed.</I></P>

<HR>

<P><B>Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods, Kunark</B></P>

<P><I>Give Telin Darkforest the Warmly Glowing Stone.</I></P>

<P>Telin Darkforest nods as he unbuckles his sword and hands it to you. 'The storm callers are working on containing and fighting against 
the corruption but they can not hold back the inevitable for long. It is up to us to strike against Innoruuk directly. If we were warriors or 
paladins we would have a fancy ceremony and plenty of feasting but we're just  rangers, without time for pleasantries. The sword you hold 
in your hands is one of the oldest blades known, even to the eldest. To strike at the darkest heart of evil requires a weapon beyond this, or 
even ones you may carry at your side. The first task, the first preperation you must make is the smithing of that blade. Its edge sharpened, 
its balance made perfect. When you have finished, bring me this sword again.</P>

<P><I>Telin gives you an "Ancient Longsword," which identifies as a "Finely Crafted Longsword."</I></P>
