<P><B>Velious Quest Armor</B><BR>

<P><B>Forest Stalker's Armour [Kael Drakkal]</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Gragek Mjlorkigar'<BR>
Gragek Mjlorkigar says 'Greetings to you. I seek one who is a protector of nature. A ranger is what you call them I believe. Are you a ranger?'</P>

<P>You say, 'I am a ranger'<BR>
Gragek Mjlorkigar says 'I have not seen your kind in quite some time. Do you seek aid in your never-ending fight against those who do nature harm? There is 
no need to answer for I see within your eyes, the commitment and the conviction. None the less, the tasks I set before you shall be none the easier. Are you 
ready to submit to my will?'</P>

<P>Unfortunately, I am missing the next line here. I am assuming it is "'I am ready to submit your will." In any case, asking him about the armour type that 
you want will result in him giving you the quest. Remember to use coif for the helmet, sleeves for the vambraces and leggings for the greaves. For example, if 
you wanted to ask about the Forest Stalker's Vambraces (arms,) you would say "what about sleeves" which should result in Gragek Mjlorkigar saying "I require 
an ancient tarnished chain sleeves and three flawed emeralds. Do this so that I may grant you these special sleeves as a gift for your diligence." If he does 
not give you the quest, you have a faction issue.</P>

<P>Faction: Kael Drakkal is divided into three factions: Kromrif, Kromzek and King Tormax. Of these three factions, you will need ally Kromzek faction to deal 
with the quest NPC. Since you have to go past a bunch of giants that are on King Tormax faction and who see through invisibility spells, it is also 
recommended that you not be KOS to them. Kromrif faction is completely optional. Having it will allow you to move around Kael Drakkal as a whole more 
without being invisible, but it is not needed to get to the quest mobs.</P>

<P>Kromzek: If your guild raids Temple of Veeshan West, you can gain the faction while you are raiding for armour. Mobs in this area of all will give you positive 
hits to Kromzek faction but not either of the other two. Altenately, you can kill Coldian Dwarves (for heads) or Velks Kobalds (for paws) and give them to 
Captain Bvellos, in the bank building, for positive hits to all three giant factions. To check this faction, the fancy dressed giants in the house were Wenglaks 
is are all on Kromzek faction. If you are still working your way out of KOS, they do not see through invisibility spells. You can go invisble, target one then 
move somewhere out of visible range, drop invisibility and do a consider check. (Wenglaks himself appears to be Beta Neutral, so do not use him.)</P>

<P>King Tormax: If your guild raids Dain or Lord Yelinak, both of these mobs will give you positive faction hits towards King Tormax. Altenately, you can kill 
Coldian Dwarves (for heads) or Velks Kobalds (for paws) and give them to Captain Bvellos, in the bank building, which gives  you positive hits to all three giant 
factions.</P>

<P><B>Golden Leaf Armour [Skyshrine]</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Nalelin Fe`Dhar'<BR>
Nalelin Fe`Dhar says 'Greetings, I seek the ones who stalk through the forests protecting it. If you are one known as a ranger, submit to my will and become 
stronger. The tasks I set forth will not be easy, Half Elf. Are you ready to submit to my will?'</P>

<P>You say, 'i am ready to submit your will'<BR>
Nalelin Fe`Dhar says 'That is good, for there is nothing like the wrath of nature, woodland warrior. And Nature's wrath shall you be, with this armor to protect 
you in your struggle. I shall forge a coif, breastplate, sleeves, bracers, gauntlets, leggings, and boots for you.'</P>

<P>If Nalelin Fe`Dhar responds as shown above, you are ready to do the quest. However, you may go a step further by saying 'what' followed by the armour 
piece. If your faction is high enough, Nalelin Fe`Dhar will tell you what items are needed. This is especially important to do when multiquesting to ensure that 
both people have the needed faction. For example, if you want ask about the Golden Leaf Greaves (legs,) you would say "What Leggins" which should result in 
Nalelin Fe`Dhar saying "A pair of leggings you seek? I seek something as well. Bring me a pair of unadorned chain leggings and three flawed sea sapphires. Go 
now. The struggle continues as we speak." If he does not give you the quest, you have a faction issue.</P>

Faction: Faction for these quests is best obtained by killing giants in the arena area in Kael Drakkal. If you find that the giants are a little too hard, you may 
want to try near elsewhere in the zone, but make sure that you are getting Claws of Veeshan faction as not all giants give this. Some of the giants in 
Wakening Lands give better Skyshrine faction hits than the ones in Great Divide.</P>

<P><B>Runed Scout's Armour [Thurgadin]</B></P>

<P>You say, 'Hail, Argash.'<BR>
Argash says, 'Greetins Crydee, you look like a Half Elf who knows the value of a good bow when ye see one. I'll let ye in on a li'l secret, the bow is the greatest 
of all weapons as it allows ye to inflict maximum punishment on yer foes with minimum risk. How can ye possibly go wrong? Or, better yet, if'n ye be a ranger, 
I can see my way clear to making you a coif, tunic, sleeves, bracer, guantlets, leggings or boots that I'm sure ye will enjoy.'</P>

<P>If Argash responds as above, you should be ready to do the quest as there does not appear to be additional quest setup trigger phrases. However, you 
may go a step further by saying 'what' followed by the armour piece. If your faction is high enough, Argrash will tell you what items are needed. This is 
especially important to do when multiquesting to ensure that both people have the needed faction. For example, if you wanted to ask about the Runed Scout's 
Coif (head,) you would say "what about coif" which should result in Argrash saying "To create a piece of armor to protect your sensitive skull, I will require 
three pieces of crushed coral as well as a corroded chain coif." If he does not give you the quest, you have a faction issue.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Gems:</B></P>

<P>The type and amound of gems needed is the same for all three armor set and depends on which piece is being made.</P>

<P>Boots: 3 Crushed Black Marble<BR>
Bracer: 3 Crushed Flame Emeralds [for each bracer]<BR>
Breastplate: 3 Flawless Diamonds<BR>
Gauntlets: 3 Crushed Topaz<BR>
Greaves: 3 Flawed Sea Sapphires<BR>
Helm: 3 Crushed Coral<BR>
Vambraces: 3 Flawed Emeralds</P>
