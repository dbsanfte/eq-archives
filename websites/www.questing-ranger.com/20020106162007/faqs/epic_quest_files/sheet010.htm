<P><B>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P><I>Kinlo Strongarm is located in Kaladim [B] in Everhot's Forge, bottom floor. This part is completely optional. It is here just for 
completeness as it adds to the story of the quest.</I></P>

<P>You say, 'what ancient'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'The ancient smiths, for what I think yer askin about, ain't been around fer a long time, laddy. Last anyone heard o' 
the ancients was 'fore my time even. There be more than a few tales about 'em.<BR>
You say, 'what few tales'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'There be some who talk about how the ancient smiths went down to work fer the duke o' below, sayin he be needin 
some fine dwarven smiths fer makin some castle or some such. There be tales that the ancients were so good at smithin that the duke took 
'em down and made 'em head smiths over his minions. There's even tales that some o the smiths' souls were trapped in their hammers, stuck 
there by some necromancer or somethin, as punishment or retribution.<BR>
You say, 'what hammer hammers?'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'Aye. Some says their souls were bound into their hammers by an Erudite necromancer and enchanter. They say they 
used the power of the hammers ta profit by makin ships, boats, and houses better than any other merchants. Sad tale, if'n it be true.<BR>
You say, 'what Erudite necromancer?'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'I'm not knowin more about the story, lad. Everythin I know is already in what I said. Aye, Erudites. I suppose if yer 
wantin ta run after shortbeard tales ya can look over on that plague island they call Odus.<BR>
You say, 'What Erudite enchanter?'<BR>
Kinlo Strongarm says 'I'm not knowing more about the story, lad. Everything I know is already in what I said. Aye, Erudites. I suppose if yer 
wantin ta run after shortbeard tales you can look over on that plagued island they call Odus.</P>

<P><B>Jaeil the Wretched in The Hole, Odus</B></P>

<P><I>Jaeil the Wretched can be found in The Hole. I do not have a location for him because I have not heard of anyone having difficulties 
finding him. He does not despawn and should always be there. The only hard part here is getting to Jaeil the Wretched. If you can get there, 
you should be able to deal with Jael the Insane with no problems. This will be a triggered spawn, and you will need to be prepared to fight 
him.</I></P>

<P>Jaeil the Wretched whimpers pathetically as his reflection catches his eye. He turns and stares pitifully at the ceiling.</P>

<P>Jaeil the Wretched shields his eyes from his reflection in the water, occasionally gibbering as he scratches at a flapping, rotted patch 
of skin on his sunken face. In his arms he cradles something. He seems to emanate an aura of power.</P>

<P><I>Stand behind Jaeil the Wretched to make him indifferent to you, then give him the Shiny Tin Bowl so that he will see his 
reflection.</I></P>

<P>Jaeil the Wretched howls in anger, his body seeming to suck energy from the walls around him as he sees his reflection. He pulls a 
hammer from the bundle in his arms and swings fiercely at your head.</P>

<P><I>Jaeil the Insane spawns and attacks. Kill Jaeil the Insane and loot the "Soulbound Hammer," which identifies as Hammer of an 
ancient dwarf. Jaeil the Wretched will still be there; just ignore him as he is not part of the fight. You only need to fight Jaeil the 
Insane.</I></P>

<P><I>If for any reason your entire raiding party dies at Jaeil the Insane or on the way there, the easiest way to recover is by having some 
people make Halfling Rogues that worship Brell Serilis, then have a Druid port to Misty Thicket to pick them up and port them to Toxxulia 
Forest, cast Spirt of the Wolf, then run to the Hole. Additionally, you can bind in the Paineel area, near the lake outside The Hole. If you 
duck, you should be able to fit through the crack in the door. Most mobs in The Hole will look at these characters dubiously, but will not 
argo. For the ones that will argo, you can Hide and Sneak to get past them. You will want at least two - one to drag corpses from past the 
drop down point to the ledge and a second to drag corpses from the ledge to near the entrance area.</I></P>

<P><B>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P><I>Give the Soulbound Hammer to Kinlo Strongarm. [Note: This part is optional. It is here to give you a clue as to what eventually 
needs to be done with the hammer.]</I></P>

<P>Kinlo Strongarm examines the hammer respectfully, admiring its craftsmanship. He strikes it against his anvil and winces as a howl fills the 
air. 'This is one of the ancients' hammers? I can almost, well, almost hear it callin ta me. It's strong, that's fer sure, lad. I don't know how ye 
got it, but aye, a dwarf could make a mighty blade with this. It's lookin like this thing still has its owner inside it though. I'm not knowin how, 
and not wantin to know, but fer yer own good ye better find some way ta get 'im out.'</P>

<P><I>Kinlo gives you back the "Soulbound Hammer," which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.</I></P>

<P><B>Mairee Silentone in Eurdin, Odus</B></P>

<P><I>Mairee Silentone is in the jewlrey shop near the bank. She is at the back of the store. If your faction with her is less than indifferent, 
stand behind her and use sneak.</I></P>

<P>You say, 'What ancient hammer?'<BR>
Mairee Silentone says 'Yes, the ancient hammer. I heard something about that. Do you mind if I take a look at it?'</P>

<P><I>Give Mairee Silentone the "Soulbound Hammer," which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.</I></P>

<P>Mairee Silentone makes a few marks on the hammer, and all the while you can hear a muffled cursing coming from the hammer head. 
'Yes, it is an ancient dwarf's hammer. Interesting artifact. I've marked it to keep it stable while you retrieve something for me. You need to 
travel to the Plane of Air and find a swirling sphere of color. Bring it and the hammer back to me.'</P>

<P><I>Mairee Silentone gives you the "Dwarven Smiths Hammer," which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.</I></P>

<P><B>Plane of Sky</B></P>

<P><I>The Swirling Sphere of Color drops on either Island 4 or 5 [depending on if you count Djorn's Island.] To get to Island 5, you must do 
all the previous islands in order. Since Island 2 [Noble Djorn] may be skipped, it is not always counted. The Islands are:
<OL>
	<LI>Fairy</LI>
	<LI>Noble Djorn</LI>
	<LI>Azarack</LI>
	<LI>Gorgalisk</LI>
	<LI>Pegasus &amp; Griffons</LI>
	<LI>Spiroc</LI>
	<LI>Bazzazzt</LI>
	<LI>Sister of Spire</LI>
	<LI>Eye of Veeshan</LI>
</OL></I></P>

<P><I>The way the mobs work on this island is that you will first see Level 52 mobs. When these are killed, they split int two new mobs 
that are Level 54. When the Level 54 mobs are killed, they split into two new mobs that are Level 56. One of the Level 56 mobs will be an 
"Essence Tamer," which is the mob that drops the Swirling Sphere of Color.</I></P>

<P><I>The Plane of Air can only be reached by the Level 46 Wizard spell "Alter Plane: Sky." This spell does require a reagent to be cast 
called "Cloudy Stone of Veeshan," which is needed for each person traveling to the Plane of Sky. This reagent can only be purchased at 
the 3rd floor of the City Library of Erudin and costs around 200-250PP depending on your faction.</I></P>

<P><I>Go to Island Five of the Plane of Sky. Kill the Essensce Tamer to get the "Swirling Sphere of Color," which identifies as Magic 
Sphere from Plane of Sly. This will require a major guild raid to complete. If your guild can handle Venril Sathir, it should be able to handle 
this.</I></P>

<P><I>Give Mairee Silentone the Dwarven Smiths Hammer and the Swirling Sphere of Color.</I></P>

<P>Mairee Silentone holds the sphere and makes intricate marks and patterns on it, eventually turning the entire crystal clear. She rolls it 
across the hammer, raising a ringing sound in the room. 'There. Now take the hammer back to Kinlo. He'll know what to do from here. Good 
luck to you .'</P>

<P><I>Mairee Silentone gives you the "Hammer of the Ancients," which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.</I></P>

<P><B>Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim [B], Faydwer</B></P>

<P><I>Give Kinlo Strongarm the Hammer of the Ancients, which causes Usbak the Old to spawn.</I></P>

<P>Kinlo Strongarm looks at the hammer and nods once before slamming the head against his anvil, and shattering the head. In a cloud of 
dust, another dwarf appears from the cloud and tosses you a hunk of metal. Kinlo stares in awe.</P>

<P><I>Usbak the Old gives you "Small bit of Mithril Ore," which identifies as Small bit of Mithril Ore.</I></P>

Usbak the Old says 'Took ya long enough! Ye'd think ya had an orc head on them shoulders there. I'm owin' ya for yer help though. Else I'd 
have been on that darn hammer for ages. Ye said ya had an ancient blade or somethin ta be smithin. If so lemme see it.</P>

<P><I>If you found it necessary to use sneak to get Kinlo to respond to you favorably, you will need to use sneak with Usbak the Old as 
well. Give Usbak the Old the Ancient Longsword and he gives you the "Refined Ancient Sword," which identifies as Sword to show 
Telin.</I></P>

<P>Usbak the Old admires the blade and then starts to bang the edge with a hammer. 'Hah, that was a good blade, no doubt. Ain't seen one 
I couldn't make better though. I'm knowin' yer cause and all I know is ye should take that ancient blade ta yer friend in the woods, he'll know 
what to do now. With that I'm gonna be takin muh leave. Debt paid and all. If'n yer wantin' another blade, which ye do, ye got enough ore 
left that Kinlo can do it for ye'</P>

<P><I>Usbak the Old despawns. Give the Small bit of Mithril Ore to Kinlo Stirngarm and he forges the "Refined Mithril Blade" for you.</I></P>

<P>Kinlo Strongarm says 'Erm. Well, I aint never worked with this stuff but here's what I got for ya. It ain't bad, pretty much like the one ye 
got there. I suppose ye should take the one the ancient made and show it ta yer friend.</P>

<P>Telin Darkforest smiles slowly. 'Now that's fine work. Just a moment, we have a friend here who can enchant one of the blades. Give 
her the blade the ancient smithed.'</P>

<P><I>Faelin appears. Give her the Refined Ancient Sword. She enchants it and returns it to you in the form of Swiftwind.</I></P>

<P>Faelin smiles at you, then closes her eyes as she sets the gem 'Nature's Balance' into the crossguard and begins to channel her spirit 
into the sword. The ground rumbles loudly as she casts. She collapses in exhaustion after a short time. 'Take the blade, and perhaps you 
can finish this. You must strike at Innoruuk's heart. Bring his shattered gem and the mithril blade to Xanuusus. Only with Innoruuk's death 
can the balance of the land once again be restored. If we do not meet again, remember you always have my eternal thanks.'</P>

<P><B>Strike Directly Against Innoruuk</B></P>

<P><I>Go to the Plane of Hate and slay Innoruuk for the "Shattered Emerald of Corruption." This will require a guild raid to complete, but 
should be easy in comparison to some of the other mobs you have encountered. The Shattered Emerald of Corruption is now a random/rare 
drop from any of the sub-boss mobs in the Plane of Hate in addition to being a random/rare drop from Innoruuk. If you are on a Plane of Hate 
raid, I strongly recommend killing all sub-boss mobs just to increase the chances of getting this paticular drop.</I></P>

Xanuusus says 'Greetings, small one! I am Xanuusus of the Stormreapers. You are welcome to rest beneath my mighty branches.</P>

<P><I>Give Xanuusus the Refined Mithril Blade and the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.</I></P>

<P>Xanuusus waves his hands over the gem of corruption and a wave of warm energy passes through the area. With care for such a huge 
creature, he melds the gem into the sword and seems to glow all over as he channels energy into the weapon. 'Thus is the link of hate 
broken between Innoruuk and the spirit of earth. Through your will has balance returned. Your deeds, your work for the good of all, will be 
remembered by anyone who walks beneath the canopy of a forest or roams the plains. Continue your vigil over nature's balance.'</P>
