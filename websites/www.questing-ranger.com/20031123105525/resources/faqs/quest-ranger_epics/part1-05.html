<P>Swiftwind and Earthcaller: Walkthrough Part 1 - Obtain the Shiny Tin Bowl</P>

<P><B>Althele in East Karana, Antonica</B></P>

<P><I>Althele can be found close to the Barbarian Village around NEG 3650, NEG 1600. Tholris and Fang should also be there with her. If
you see any of the other druids with her, do not give her the coin right away. First check to see if someone is currently in the process of
doing this part of the quest. If this is the case, just wait for them to finish up. Althele, Tholris and Fang all respawn thirty minutes after all
the druids have been despawned. The other possibility, is that someone had tried to do this part of the quest, failed and the spawn is
messed up. If this is the case, you may have to wait for the server till after the server goes down again to be able to the quest.</I></P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
Do not proceed with this part until you are ready to deal with (fight) the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Dark Elf Reavers that will spawn. If you
fail to kill the Dark Elf Corruptor, you will have to the start quest over from the beginning. This can be done with only a few people or with
2-3 groups. It really depends on which classes you bring, their levels and gear. Have everyone else wait up on the hill were the Dark Elf
Corruptor spawns. If you are grouped with someone on the hill, you can use that person to track your way back to where everyone is
waiting rather quickly.</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Althele'<BR>
Althele says 'Hello, friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally but lately?'</P>

<P>You say, 'hail Tholris'<BR>
Tholris stares in contemplation at the landscape.<BR>
Althele says 'Tholris does not speak much. He is here to assist me in my duties. He is my hands, as Fang is my eyes.<BR>
Fang barks in response to Althele's words.'</P>

<P>You say, 'Why do you need him as your hands and Fang as your eyes?'<BR>
Althele says 'Yes. I cannot see any longer, my sight long since lost in the march of years. By the blessings of Tunare and Karana, though, I
still make myself useful.'</P>

<P>*Give Coin to Althele*<BR>
Althele looks at the coin and nods gravely at you as she slips it into a fold of her clothing. 'I see. The story of this coin speaks much to me
as do the words you have given me. Telin sent word that you would arrive. The tidings you bring are ill indeed. Here, take this amulet and
find Sionae. She is nearby. We will speak more on this matter when all are present.'</P>

<P>Althele gives you a "<A href="javascript:popupOldInventory('braided_grass_amulet')">Braided Grass Amulet</A>" to take to
Sionae.</P>

<P><I>Sionae spawns immediately after you give Althele the Worn Dark Metal Coin and receive the Braided Grass Amulet. She can be found
around NEG 2300, NEG 930.</I></P>

<P>*Give Braided Grass Amulet to Sionae*<BR>
Sionae says 'I see that the time has come. Take the amulet and give it to the third of our kin, Nuien. I will meet you at the gathering.'</P>

<P>Sionae gives you a "<A href="javascript:popupOldInventory('frayed_braided_grass_amulet')">Frayed Braided Grass Amulet</A>"
and Nuien will spawn.</P>

<P><I>Nuien spawns immediately after you give Sionae the Braided Grass Amulet and receive the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet. He can be
found around NEG 3650, NEG 300, which is around the obelisk on the hill in the gnoll area.</I></P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
You need to move quickly to Nuien. People who are kill on sight to druids may walk past him due to where he spawns, which will cause
him to agro on that person and could results in him being killed. If Nuien is killed, the spawn will be messed up and you will have to start
quest all over to the point of going back to Telin Darkforest for another Worn Note. However, if Nuien has agroed on someone, you can
still turn in the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet to him and spawn Teloa.</I></P>

<P>*Give Frayed Braided Grass Amulet to Nuien.*<BR>
Nuien says 'So be it. Do as you have done before and find the next. Teloa is the last.'</P>

<P>Nuien gives the "<A href="javascript:popupOldInventory('frayed_braided_grass_amulet')">Frayed Braided Grass Amulet</A>" back to you
and Teloa will spawn.</P>

<P><I>Teloa spawns immediately after you give Nuien the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet and receive it back from him. She can be found
around NEG 3800, NEG 2860, which is near the waterfall that is close to the Barbarian Village.</I></P>

<P>*Give Frayed Braided Grass Amulet to Teloa.*<BR>
Teloa begins walking toward the gathering spot. 'Follow me to the gathering now.'</P>

<P><I>You do not get the amulet back from Teloa as you no longer need it. Just follow her back to where Althele and the other druids are
waiting.</I></P>

<P>Althele says 'Great mother of life and father of sky, growth and spirit, Tunare and Karana. Innoruuk once again schemes and we have
failed in our duties to protect our land. We give our powers in sacrifice for your help. Heed our call and send us your wisdom.'</P>

<P>Althele snaps her head towards you. 'Innoruuk's brood is upon us. Go, find the spawn of hatred before they reach this point and destroy
them!'</P>

<P>Dark Elf Corruptor shouts 'We come for you, fools. Your reign of weakness over the powers of the land comes to an end now!</P>

<P><I>Return to the hill then kill the Dark Elf Corruptor and Reavers. (While some advocate killing the Dark Elf Corruptor and allowing the
Dark Elf Reavers to kill the druids, I don't for several reasons. First, it is not within the theme of the quest. Secondly, it is more time
productive to kill the reavers also then turn in the Fleshbound Tome to Althele right away as you will have to wait longer to turn in the
book.</I></P>

<P>Dark Elf Corruptor<BR>
Level: 45-50<BR>
Class: ?<BR>
The Dark Elf Corruptor is a melee oriented mob that is about Level 50. He can cast some spells, but does not harm touch.</P>

<P>Dark Elf Reaver<BR>
Level: 45-50<BR>
Class: Shadow Knight<BR>
The two Dark Elf Reavers are slightly higher in level and are both shadow knights. They will begin their attack with a harm touch.</P>

<P>Setup:<BR>
This should have been done before starting the sequence with Althele.</P>

<P>Tactics:<BR>
You will want to have one or two people kiting the Dark Elf Reavers around while everyone else concentrates on the Dark Elf Corruptor.
It is very critical that you agro for the Dark Elf Corruptor is not lost as he will start walking towards the druids. Should the Dark Elf Corruptor
gets towards the bottom of the hill, he will despawn thus you will have to start over. The mobs themselves are fairly easy to kill. After you
kill the Dark Elf Corruptor, you can then kill the two Dark Elf Reavers. While they technically do not need to be killed, it is not within the
theme of the quest to allow them to kill the druids.</P>

<P>Important Note:<BR>
These mobs are all on Neriak faction and multiple raids on them will cause problems for evil friends wishing to assist you.</P>

<P>Once the Dark Elf Corruptor is dead, loot his corpse to get the "<A href="javascript:popupOldInventory('fleshbound_tome')">Fleshbound Tome</A>" to take to Althele</P>

<P>*Give the "Fleshbound Tome" to Althele.*<BR>
Althele hands the book to Tholris who reads through it with lines of concern etched on his face, then whispers into her ear. 'Dire news,
indeed. This cannot be allowed. I must keep this book but you must not allow Innoruuk, to seed the land with his hatred and filth. You
have only just begun your quest. The path you are guided upon will be difficult, if not impossible, but someone must finish it. Please, take
this, read of it, follow its instructions. Tunare bless your path and Karana watch over you.'</P>

<P>Althele gives you the "<A href="javascript:popupOldInventory('earth_stained_note')">Earth Stained Note</A>" to take to Ella Foodcrafter and the druids despawn.</P>

<P>Earth Stained Note:<BR>
'We cannot speak again. Our circle is now known and must seek sanctuary. In case this note were to fall into others’ hands. I cannot tell
you plainly the next steps of your task. All I can say is to seek she who walks the path of the mother, she who walks the lands in service
to her kin. Give her this note and she will know'</P>
