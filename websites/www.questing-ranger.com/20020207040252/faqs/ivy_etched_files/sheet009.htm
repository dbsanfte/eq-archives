<HR>

<P><B>Sol Cauldron</B></P>

<P>This will be given to you by Lord Searfire in the Temple of Solusek Ro. More than likely, your faction with him will not be sufficient to 
receive the cauldron. There are serveral ways to gain faction with him:<UL>
	<LI>Kill many Shadowed Men.</LI>
	<LI>Give 30 GP at a time to Rathmana Allin in South Ro.</LI>
	<LI>Give 4 Cutthroat Insignia Rings to Ortallius in South Ro.</LI>
	<LI>Go to the graveyard in Mistmoore Castle. Take the flower of the coffin and give it to the named Shadowed Man behund the 
		crypt.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Once you have sufficient faction, Lord Searfire will give you the Sol Cauldron.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Mistmoore Granite</B></P>

<P>Go to Mitmoore Castle and kill Fouting Gargoyles, Jeering Gargoyles or Leering Gargoyles for Mistmoore Granite. The granite drops very 
rarely off of the Gargoyles outside of the castle. You have a better chance of getting the Granite inside of the castle. There are two 
Gargoyles in the main entrance room, a group of four right before the Kitchen and one in each of the servant rooms. There are several 
other places where you will find Gargoyles, but these are perhaps the safest places to hunt them.</P>

<P>Once you get two pieces of Granite, place one in the Sol Cauldron and set the other aside to be turned in separately.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Sands of Ro</B></P>

<P>Go to the Oasis of Marr and kill Sand Giants until you get the Sands of Ro. You can also find Sand Giants in South Ro though they are 
not nearly as common there. Place the Sands of Ro in the cauldron.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Soil of Underfoot</B></P>

<P>Soil of Underfoot is made from Fairy Dust. Unfortunately, to do the Rain Caller quest properly, you cannot go and slay fairies. Since Fairy 
Dust is tradeable, the smart thing to do here is to get someone else to do the vile fairy slaying for you. You will need four Fairy Dust.</P>

<P>More than likely Priestess Ghalea of the Kaladim Cleric Guild won't like you. I have no idea what her problem is, but it can be solved with 
lots and lots of bone chips. Check out the nearby Paladin guild. Give Gunlok Jure four Bone Chips at a time to get the faction you need. You 
can then give Priestess Ghalea the four Fairy Dusts to receive the Soil of Underfoot. Place this item in the Sol Cauldron.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Melatite</B></P>

<P>Melatite drops of the gnomish robots in the Gnome area of Solusek's Eye. It is a rare drop and killing these produces bad gnome faction. 
Not just in Solusek's Eye, where they sell Tinkerer Bags, but back in Ak'Akanon as well. The best thing to do here is to check the gnome 
merchants as you will sometimes see them selling it due to someone killing the robots but still having sufficient faction to deal with the 
merchants. If this doesn't work, I recommend having someone kill the robots for you to get the Melatite. However you decide to do it, put 
one Melatite in the Sol Cauldron.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>2 Enchanted Bars of Platinum</B></P>

<P>You will need to deal with an enchanter for this one. Either by buying two pre-enchanted bars or buy having him enchant them for you. 
Place two Enchanted Bars of Platinum in the Sol Cauldron.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Bar of Ronium</B></P>

<P>Once you have all of the ingredients in the Sol Cauldron, press the combine button to produce a Bar of Ronium.</P>

<HR>

<P><B>Ivy Etched Boots</B></P>

<P>Give Leaf Falldim the Mistmoore Granite, a Bar of Ronium and 2000 GP to receive the Ivy Etched Boots. [Note: Giving him the equivalent 
amount using other coins will not work.]</P>
