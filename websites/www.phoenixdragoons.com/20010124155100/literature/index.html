							<p>The dawn of day,<br>
							Arrives today;<br>
							The morning dew,<br>
							Makes life anew;<br>
							The clouds unformed,<br>
							At the young blue sky;<br>
							The birds are stirring,<br>
							For a brand new day.
							<p>Then ^suddenly,<br>
							As ^swiftly as it ^started;<br>
							Rode ^past a paladin, <br>
							On a ^noble steed;<br>
							^Swiftly he ^moved,<br>
							Like the ^WINDS of ^persecution!<br>
							His ^name is ^JUSTICE,<br>
							As he ^charged into.
							<p>The ^besieged temple,<br>
							Of the ^magnificent phoenix;<br>
							There ^fought a lady,<br>
							Of ^FURY high!<br>
							With berserkers rage,<br>
							He ^screamed like mad;<br>
							^Slashing away,<br>
							Foes' ^HEADS away!
							<p>Thus frightened HELL'S spirits,<br>
							Who ^fled away;<br>
							They ^sink down deep,<br>
							In the ^abyss,<br>
							Of ^endless night.
							<p>With ^battle wounds on him,<br>
							And ^sweat on his face,<br>
							He ^went to the lady,<br>
							Of the ^wondrous temple.
							<p>With UTMOST ^grace and humility,<br>
							He ^greets and asks of her health;<br>
							With ^her granting her appreciation,<br>
							He ^places a ^kiss on her hand.
							<p>And ^JUST after he did that,<br>
							With a dramatic ^swish of his ^robe,<br>
							He ^rides his ^noble steed,<br>
							A^way like a ^hurricane.

						<p>
						<br>Note from the poet: I tried to write this poem based on the conception by Vanion. It was by no means easy. I tried very hard to combine concepts related to the ranger, the paladin and the cleric; namely nature, nobility and humility. Then I combined it with Vanion's perception of a certain paladin from the Phoenix Dragoons, who is respected, yet more of an independent paladin. Thus, I tried to make it "flow" as naturally as possible, and making it rhyme naturally.
						<p>If you have noticed, the poem was written to move "like" a hurricane, which is a force of nature. I didn't really want to write something of a "knight in shining armor," so I went the opposite way and wrote something fast (needless to say, something very dangerous), romantic and passionate, rather than something that was lifeless, monotonous and routine.
						<p>Needless to say, this is at great expense, but since it was a very special request by Vanion, it was reason enough for me to write this poem. That is what friendship is to me (despite the fact I do something wish I get paid for doing this :p.)
						<p>Lastly, bug Vanion for the name of the person this was meant to be dedicated. I am too lazy to write the name of the deserving person. ^_^

						A week in the life of Anyka.......
						<ol>
							<li>Grub and I went to OOT Saturday to kill specs, but stopped to see if the AC had spawned.  We were fully loaded, so Grub decides to pull the Cyclops. (Let me tell you, the AC placeholder is a good 4 or 5 levels higher than the clops in Rathe.)
								<p>So all of a sudden we have a kite parade.  Grub is running in circles around Tower Island screaming for DD, with this  huge mob after him and my slower earth pet chasing the mob without success, and me running after the pet. Nobody is hitting anything.  Unfortunately for Grub, he has just re-binded on the dock of Sister's Island and the Cyclops really doesn't appreciate that level 44 enchanter DoT.
								<p>So I try stopping.  Every time he comes around, I throw a DD as soon as I see him, but they get out of range just as the spell goes off.   Then I start trying to cut over the island to head them off, so Grub is now losing sight of me completely which doesn't exactly comfort him.
								<p>Finally, he tries cutting/circling back and forth in front of me for a while. Well, every time I hit the clops for 300, the clops hits Grub for 100 or 150, a losing equation.  I am of course trying not to laugh all the while, as I REALLY don't want to see G. lose that 1/2 bubb of xp, not to mention the thrilling prospect of soloing this thing at a double- penalty level (41).
								<p>Well a happy ending to it, I finally did enough damage to turn the thing on myself and then my earth pet was able to taunt it, a losing strategy for a mob.  We killed it with G. down to about a bubble of HP and me at about three.
								<p>These hairy fights are a lot of fun if you win.  Sure beats the boredom of an LGuk camp.
							<li>Flying:  If you can ever do it, get in a bard train with Serax when you are all levitated, and jump off mountains. DC is the best for this, since unlike Lava it has some pretty parts.  Second best is to get a level 50 SoW and do it solo.  It's like one of those travelogues shot from a helicopter in the Alps.
							<li>A real laugh in LGuk.  Sevastian and I were grouped with this complete idiot 50 mage in the Lower Tower, Wumbik or something like that.  He was equipped like you would expect at level 35, didn't have but one pet spell (earth) which meant he was breaking Sev's snares, didn't bother trying to get his pet off mezzed mobs, constantly bragged about how much stronger he was than everyone else, took at least half of the loots, and didn't even bother to fight half the time.  He just sucked up our xp without getting any himself or even doing his part.
								<p>So Sev and I start trading really nasty comments to amuse ourselves. Trouble is, Sev is in tells with both this guy and myself, and is using the "r" button to respond.  So he sends this guy a four-line diatribe, meant for me, by mistake.
								<p>You know how sensitive Sev is. I am of course in stitches of laughter as he tries to apologize to the guy. So we make our comments in guildsay to prevent a repeat.  Trouble is, I now send another nastygram but hit "/g" instead of "/gu".
								<p>Well, the guy needed to hear it I guess.

					<font face="Verdana" size="2">
						It was a clear evening, the sun had just gone down. The sky was a beautiful shade of red. I was sitting beside the river in South Karana, about a mile east of the stone bridge, meditating to regain my mental strength from a previous battle. My pet, Garann, was vigilantly on the lookout for anything that may try to kill us either because we look like an easy meal or because of my reputation as a helper to all good citizens.
						<p>After replenishing my mental capacity and healing, I got up and was ready to explore more. Upon reaching the top of the riverbank I thought I spotted an adult female elephant. I know that their ivory tusks are relatively valuable, and my need for money was apparent to me; I was almost ready for my next level of training with my mentor. Training with him and learning to cast new spells takes a lot of money. Money I did not have. I spotted the elephant out of the corner of my eye, yet when I turned to look directly it was not there. I knew that I saw something, so I traveled in the direction of my sighting and, after a lengthy jog, I came upon the adult female that I had seen. I checked with Garann to make sure he was up to the task. Garann was more than ready and eager to engage the beast. I gave the command to attack and thus began the battle.
						<p>Garann fought bravely and without fear as I cooked the adult female elephant. It turned on me and I barely escaped a crushing blow. Garann hit it hard and turned her attention back to him. I backed away to get some distance between me and the fight. As I backed away, I saw that the female wasn't totally alone. She had a calf with her that was feeding on the nutritious South Karana grass just out of my sight when I initiated the battle. The sound of the battle and it's mama's cries of agony brought it charging back to her. Very concerned that I may have sealed our doom, I found it hard to cast. Garann was now getting double-teamed by both mama and baby. I composed myself and started successfully hitting the mother with volleys of fire. The stench of burning elephant flesh permeated the air.
						<p>I found it quite interesting how Garran's frost spell was actually putting out the fires that my spell were creating. For an instant, I thought of how much torture that poor beast must be going through. To suddenly have your skin boil from fire and then instantaneously freeze over from the extreme cold of Garaan's spell, and then have it repeat over and over, must really hurt. It was something that I never want to feel.
						<p>I knew that Garran must be getting near death. He was taking a beating from the two elephants so I stepped up my casting. My metal capacities were becoming strained. My head began to ache from the amount of concentration I brought to bear casting my spells. Suddenly, the female elephant let out a very loud bellow and fell to the ground. It had taken all it could stand and now lay dead on the plains. But the battle wasn't over yet. To my horror, Garann died as well. He fell at almost the same time the female did. Now the calf, wounded and filled with anger, turned its sights squarely on me.
						<p>I had a couple options at my disposal and I would have to choose one fast! I could either leave the battle - transcending time and space by opening a gate and going to the safety of my sanctuary, or stay and fight. The latter was not a pleasurable thought, but I held a sadness for the baby calf. I had just killed its mother and it probably wouldn't survive on its own; it was badly hurt in the battle with Garann. I decided to put the poor calf out of its misery.
						<p>I began to cast on the calf, but before I could concentrate enough to get the volley off, the calf reached me and sent me flying with a mighty swing of its tusks. I writhed in pain as I got to my feet. I was sure that something was broken. Yelling at the calf in defiance, I attempted to cast once more. This time I had enough time to get off a volley. The calf lit up like a bonfire, the little hairs on it's skin searing away as its skin came to a boil. It added to the horrible stench that still lingered from its mother. Again, it struck me squarely, tearing a gaping wound in my side and sending my flying threw the air. I hit the ground hard and started to think that I made a seriously bad decision. I stumbled to my feet and ran under it so it couldn't see me. The calf was close to death and barely able to move, but still it moved faster than me. I cleared it before it could step on me and again I began to cast. In my haste to cast, I did not clear the calf far enough. The calf spun its huge mass around, solidly striking me yet again with its tusks. I was thrown a good fifteen feet and landed extremely hard on the ground. I coughed and it caused my mouth to fill with blood. I desperately hobbled to my feet, blood dripping from my lips. I knew that one more hit like that and I would not be getting up. Luckily, the calf was very dazed and hurting and needed time to catch its bearing and retrain on me. This gave me just enough time to cast my final volley. I was both physically and mentally drained. It was now or never. I began casting and the spell found its mark and the calf became engulfed in flames. It slowly staggered then fell to the ground dead, I slowly staggered and fell to the ground injured and exhausted. I was so relieved that it was finally over! I somehow pulled myself back to my feet. I knew that the sounds and smells from such a furious battle carried a long distance. They could easily have gotten the attention of more elephants or other opportunistic creatures that may be in the area. As quickly as I could in my condition, I took the tusks from the beasts I had just slain and left the area, the carcasses of mother and calf still smoldering.
						<p>I made my way to the river where I could bandage my wounds. I was so mentally drained that I could not even open the gate to make it to my sanctuary. As I slowly limped my way to the bank of the river, I hoped that nothing else would happen along and attack me. Stooped over and writhing in pain, I noticed a raider walking along the river looking for someone to pillage. I made sure not to venture too close, as gaining its attention would surely mean the death of me in my current condition. After he passed I sat near the river, took bandages out of my pack and applied them to my wounds. I sat in meditation, and after gaining enough mental fortitude to cast my spell, I opened the gate and entered. Now at my sanctuary, I sat and fully recuperated. As I sat I counted myself lucky to be alive and mourned the death of Garann, a brave and loyal pet to the end.

						Ever since I've been able to swing a sword, I have been protecting the wolves and bears of Surefall Glades. Although as a youngster I was tempted by the hedonistic life. Instead of honing my skills for Fair Karana, most of my time was spent slumming around Qeynos and building up a sizeable tab at the Boar's Snout, drinking Ogre Swill and whistling at Dark Elven women. It was completely by chance that I rediscovered my true calling.
						<p>On a particularly cold evening in Qeynos, I was drunkedly stumbling around the city, looking for mischief, when I heard the city's alarms blair. I made my way to the city gates where I found a melee was ensuing. It seemed a family of gnolls, Clan Darkpaw, were launching an assault on Qeynos. I stood dumbfounded as one particular beast, Nixx Darkpaw, made his way past the guards and headed straight for me! He wore a shawl of wolfhide, and I could see the gore of a wolf pup he must have consumed not half an hour before dripping from his fangs. As he raised a bloody scythe above my head, I could hardly believe the words I was shouting, "You will perish for harming the wolves of this land!". Just as he growled and prepared to strike, he was smitten by a city guard. I can still smell the awful stench that came from the thing's maw.
						<p>It was then that I saw again my destiny as clear as day. Wolfshadow, follower of the wolf, always with the wolf, destined to protect the wolf. From then on I hunted gnolls relentlessly. Moreover, I dreamed of being a werewolf hunter like my father, and my mentor Xanuusus the Treant.
						<p>To this day, I have acquired a few titles. Gnollsbane among the humans of Qeynos, Orcslicer among the dwarves, D'Hague among the noble High Elves. But none of these are as important to me as shouting, "Send your best, dogs. I'll slaughter them all!" as gnoll after gnoll falls before my blades.
						<p>I have met and have had the pleasure of adventuring with many fine people in my travels. From Jemety Thunderfist and Arideth Moonshadow to Sarnoso and Gazukull the trolls and even other Dragoons like Kalthin and Warwiz. But one particular half-elf has always been at my side: with his fellow love of alcohol and Dark Elven women, Serax "Animal Magnet" Desuarte has accompanied me on too many adventures and misadventures to recall them all...though fill my flask with Ogre Swill, sit me next to a warm fire and I might be able to recall a few...
						<p>I would be honored to become a Phoenix Dragoon not only because I feel I have to keep Serax out of trouble, but because I've heard your cause is in need of rangers (not to mention mid to high 20s).

						Like most new troubadors I was a risk taking young lad. Spending a lifetime pulling beers at my father's bar in Karana (the Boar's Snout)was not what I pictured for my future. So at an early age I went to Qeynos to finesse my musical talents. Once there however, my thirst for adenture grew. The occassional jaunt to the wilderness to bring back jewellery and loot to impress the young maidens no longer quenched my thirst for true adventure. So buying the best equipment I could afford, I committed myself to the pursuit of wealth, glory, and collecting all the greatest known magical songs known to man...
						<p>Along this personal quest, one night I had the chance to run into a fair knight by the name of Nebu Neburlung. Taking a chance, I asked Nebu if he could use the assistance of a Bard. What happened over the course of the evening changed my life forever.
						<p>Introduced to the group, I immediately felt humbled by the presence of not only this great knight Nebu, but what luck, I am introduced to Lord Vanion himself! Well if you know the motivations of a bard you can certainly guess how I was thinking at this point. Associations and name dropping have gotten me many a favor now and then, and now hehe, I could say I have travelled with the High Preceptor of one of the most illustrious Guilds on Norrath ).
						<p>Though this sounds completely self-centered, admittedly, that's how I was as a young lad. So joined with this group, we proceeded into the depths of Permafrost. Having some initial luck we made our way to the great warrior room deep within the keep. Now for those of you who haven't been there, surrounding the room are two raising and lowering spiked gates. Certainly new to the keep in Perma I had no knowledge of the traps and dangers in our immediate vicinity.
						<p>So while in the process of setting up our own ambush point, suddenly I'm lurched upward and suspended in a very small tightly locked cell just above one of the gates. Struggle as I may the gate was too firm to break, squeeze around or even use my limited skill at teleport to escape from. The room had been crafted just tight enough to not allow me the freedom of movement to use my most valued items -- my instruments! Hence I was trapped.
						<p>This is where I gained a valuable lesson, and learned the true meaning of honor. My entrapment put the entire group at risk. Deep within the confines of Permafrost is not the most friendly place to conduct a rescue AKA jailbreak. Was I abandoned? Certainly I had never met these "Dragoons" before. How could I expect them to wait with me and possibly risk their own necks until a solution could be found. But fellow guild mates that is what happened ......
						<p>Lord Mrakr immediately put himself into the trap with me and made sure I had enough food, water, and protective buffs to wait out the planned rescue. Jailed together we held off multiple attacks from wandering goblins below. Vanion, Nebu, and please forgive me if I'm leavin anyone out, held the hallway while Shenjairo made his way to our location.
						<p>Finally Shen arrived! Quickly assessing the situation, Shen entrapped himself and memmed a teleport spell. Problem solved.....
						<p>Well needless to say, I was not only happy to be out of Perma, but now had gained some insight into what makes a guild great! I knew that the Dragoons would be forever deeply endeared to me. So now I finally am one!

						Being a Dark Elf and living amongst the good races of Norrath is not an easy task. I was ridding the world of a few of my own kind in Castle Mistmoore when I met another who was also ridding the world of evil. Vanion Brightblade introduced himself as the leader of a guild of powerful people that had joined together to rid Norrath of all evil and asked if I was interested in joining the guild's cause. Just witnessing the might of this individual I knew that this guild must truly be what I have been looking for since my first summer in Norrath. I agreed to join immediately, however Vanion had other ideas. I was to first prove myself to the guild by accomplishing a feat worthy of my skills, to retrieve the Crystal Water Staff from a horrid creature named Webclaw who had been know to reside in Lake Rathetear. I was told I could contact up to 5 other members of the guild for their assistance in completing this quest, so I set to work right away the following morning, and here is the tale of how it all occurred.
						<p>Upon Awakening I headed off to Kaladim to catch StormBreaker back to my home continent Antonica where we would land in Freeport. The ship sailed for two days and when we finally pulled into our destination, I was eager to get off the ship as everyone knows that dark elves get sea sick rather easily. I then headed back to Neriak to get provisions, although I hate dealing with my evil race -- I realize that I still must do so in order to preserve my own life because unfortunatley my races evil deeds precede me. I then left Neriak and travelled through the commons to Rivervale where I spent my first night. I inquired within the local tavern there about a couple of druids named Starina and Courteous. What luck I had! The innkeep told me that they had passed through town just a couple of days prior to my arrival and that they were headed westward. I got 4 hours of sleep and left very early the next morning. I travelled through a great gorge and into some plainslands the next morning. I ran into other travellers as I approached a large marble bridge spanning a great river and asked if they had heard of the two druids I was seeking. The travellers told me that indeed they had and that they were well known in this area. Starina and Courteous had just crossed the very bridge I was standing on just hours prior to my arrival and were heading to a city in the trees. I thanked them and headed out at a slow trot across the bridge. Several hours later I reached the city and found the druids. I told them of Vanion Brightblade's quest that had been bestowed upon me and they said they would be honored to help me in this noble quest. I could not believe my luck! They accepted my friendship regardless of my race and trusted me with their very lives as we would soon find out!
						<p>The following morning we headed out as a group. We were in search of another member of the guild who was known to be a bird hunter in the Lake Rathetear region named Candu Altings. I was told that he may know the whereabouts of Webclaw. Unfortunately this is where my luck ended; we were not able to locate Candu on the mainland or any of the islands in the lake. At this moment I decided that I would not let this deter me. I did some investigating of the locals and found out that Webclaw charged the local fisherman to allow them to fish in "His Lake" and that he made regular rounds through the various fishing villages. We set camp in a cove near one of the villages where we could see Webclaw if he were to make his rounds today. As we swam about looking for this monster; we had to fight many a crocodile and shark, along with several of Webclaw's lackeys.
						<p>The day's end slowly approached and there was still no sign of Webclaw. We swam back to the fishing island and asked if we had missed him and were told no. Courteous then decided he would atempt to track Webclaw in the open water, a very dangerous thing to do; I had reservations about this idea but time was running out so I agreed to it. Courteous swam slowly away from the island and we waited. We did not have to wait long though, suddenly a brilliant flash erupted from the water and Courteous was heard above it all yelling for us to meet him at the cove because Webclaw was heading that way, close on Courteous' heals. I jumped into the water and swam as fast as I could, Starina by my side. As I entered the cove Webclaw and Courteous were locked in a battle of will and it looked like Webclaw had the advantage; after all, we were in his realm. I approached webclaw from the rear and swung my sword as hard as I could at the beast, again and again, pummeling him, but he continued to maintain his concentration on Courteous. I finally got webclaw to focus his attention on me which gave Courteous a chance to heal himself.
						<p>Starina let a mighty spell lose on Webclaw as I continued to melee with him. I screamed in agony as spell after spell reigned down on me. I could feel the skin blistering on my arms and back. I began to wonder if we were capable of defeating this beast. Just as I was losing faith in my abilities I felt a warm sensation rush through my body! Starina had healed my wounds as if I had not even been touched by any of Webclaw's spells. I continued to melee. Webclaw was surely close to death now, I could feel victory within our grasp! Courteous was chanting, preparing his mighty magics for a final blow, and when the spell left his fingertips I knew Webclaw didn't have a chance: the very water around Webclaw's body began to boil and the monster was slain! Upon his body we found the mysterious Water Crystal Staff: the object of our quest.
						<p>After days and days of celebration the staff was given to Candu Altings who we discovered had been away for a few days learning some new spells and acquiring more spell components. Candu welcomed me to the guild and congratulated me on a job well done, and I knew I was truly among friends.

						<b>Part 1 of 2</b> Nebu Neblung was the first of the guild to retire. At his retirement, he bequeathed his holy sword to the leader of the guild; this sword shall be known as The Sword of the Phoenix. Nebu had fought the good fight and decided to return to his homeland to start a family in Erudin. He was always very very smart! He retired with his equipment, as proper for a knight, as he may return again and fight the good fight with us in the future. We would all like to wish Nebu a fruitful and prosperous retirement. Live well Nebu!
						<p><b>Part 2 of 2</b> The Return of Nebu! Upon returning to Erudin, Nebu soon discovered there is little to do! He also had heard that his guild mates were distraught and wanted him to come back. The good fight was not over yet and the Dragoons had need of another good blade!
						<p>On his way back, Nebu received news of his guild joining forces and fighting for him in the wastes of Everfrost. The battlecry, "For Nebu!" was heard across the frigid plains. The Dragoons had won the day and captured two powerful magic items: the Gigantic Zwiehander and the Cloak of the Icebear. Yes, the guild had successfully <a class=Ared href="photoalbum/index.html#battleDragoonsKargIcebear" title="See pictures of the battle!">taken down Karg Icebear</a>. Nebu's heart was warmed by the thought of his friends fighting for him. Upon his return to duty, he was promoted to the rank of High General of War and presented with the Gigantic Zwiehander. We all hope Nebu will stay with us for a long time to come.

						"Why rain so much in desert?" the troll asked me.
						<p>"What?" I responded.
						<p>"It rain every 5 minute here. Me thought desert was dry with no rain"
						<p>"I dunno," I said. "I think it's just a random thing the game does. It doesn't make a difference what zone. Ask the game designers."
						<p>"Huh?"
						<p>I stood up from my meditation. "What do you mean 'huh'?"
						<p>"What game?" the troll blubbered out. "Me no think killing caiman is a game. Me kill caiman for adventure!"
						<p>"Ugh, look if you want to be some super roleplaying troll that's fine but don't act like some stupid ass that thinks this is real life."
						<p>A caiman darted by me and I lifted up my sword and took a slash at it.
						<p>"Dude, some people like to roleplay," the troll responded. "You don't have to bash them for wanting to make the game a bit more fun" He shuffled to his feet and grabbed his own caiman. There we stood side by side hacking up the reptiles to bits.
						<p>"Yeah, I know..." He had a point I suppose. I had done a bit of it, too. "Ask the gods why it rains so much," I continued. "Well, after all this is an Oasis, right? It should rain some."
						<p>"Yah."
						<p>My sword connected with the caiman for the last time. He layed dead. I scounged his body for anything i might find useful and only found body parts. That being done, I packed up my stuff and prepared to make my way to Runnyeye to see if anyone was selling the item I was so desperately seeking: blackened iron boots. I had been looking for them for quite some time. Hopefully today would be my lucky day. I bid a good day to the troll and set off towards to Desert of Northern Ro.

						I travelled over the dunes of Ro and under it's sweltering sun. I contemplated going through Freeport to pick up a few bottles of water for my journey to RunnyEye Citadel but decided that time was of the essence and that I could get some in Rivervale. So I made my way to the tunnel that connected Ro to the Commonlands. Inside, I made a quick stop and sold some of the meats I had gathered in the Oasis to the Shady Swashbuckler.
						<p>"Hello, Sevastian," he said. "Have you seen the Well-Balanced Long Sword I just got in?"
						<p>"287 plat?! Good Lordy, that's a big amount of money!"
						<p>I completed the transaction and continued on to Rivervale. After picking up some water I headed out into Misty Thicket. I always have a bad feeling when I go through that zone...tons of terrible little halflings running around poking about you. I remember once I met up with Siuan in Rivervale and while she was taking care of some business in the bank three little halflings came up and just looked at me. They didn't inspect me or say anything. They just stood there. It was a rather creepy experience.
						<p>I entered the dank, foul-smelling home of the goblins and made my auction for the boots. No response. I checked to see if anyone was even in the zone with me. Not one soul.
						<p>"Dammit!" I shouted to no one. "I came all this way for nothing!" I really wanted those boots. I needed them to complete my blackened look. I guess I'll try again tomorrow, I thought. So I left the Citadel and began to make my way to the dreaded death pit otherwise known as Unrest. It seemed to me that the only way I was going to get the boots was to get to sufficient level to get them myself. I quickly brushed that thought away, as I have never really earned anything for myself. An idea occured to me: the Honeymooners! Yes, maybe they could be of some assistance. Koston and Pebbles Hightower, recently married. I came to know them one day in Crushbone when they were giving away a Dwarven Ring Tunic to celebrate thier marriage. Pebbles was also interested in the Blackened look and we had made several transactions for pieces that the other needed. I messaged her to see what she could do about boots.
						<p>"But I want them, too," she replied.
						<p>"Ah, they aren't even noticeable on you. Have you seen me without them? I look gimpy! Besides you can wear bronze. I can't get any sort of plate 'til level 30," I pleaded.
						<p>"Heh. Ask Morten. He has some. Maybe you can talk him into selling."
						<p>"Thanks!"
						<p>I messaged Morten the Barbarian.
						<p>"Ha! I'm a warrior, I need them for kicking magic beasties."
						<p>"Bash!"
						<p>"Nah, I'm more of a kicking guy," he responded.
						<p>"30 plat! Please! Please! Please! Please!
						<p>"30 plat? Hehe, I woulda sold to the guy that offered me 50."
						<p>"Fine, 80 plat."
						<p>"I really need them, dude," said Morten. "Sorry."
						<p>"I understand ;'(."
						<p>I tried every concieveable lead. If I learned that someone had a pair I was quick to message them and try to negotiate, all to no avail. Another idea: Cynic!
						<p>"Dude...like, I'll be your servant in bondage forever if you can get me a pair." I had become utterly pathetic.
						<p>"Alright," he responded. "I'm going to RunnyEye in a bit. Maybe I'll get lucky."
						<p>"Thankyouthankyouthankyou!"
						<p>"Hehe."
						<p>Several hours later...
						<p>"Sorry, dude," he told me. "Nothing dropped them."
						<p>"That's Ok...," I sighed,"Thanks for trying."
						<p>Again my hopes were squashed. So much time had passed and I hadn't gained any level. Siuan, Vanion, Camar, Sumadin, and everyone else had grown in level. If the rate continued I would have lost my running group. I pleaded with Morten again.
						<p>"You know Runnyeye is still good xp for you," I told him.
						<p>"Hehe, you're persistent."
						<p>"Doggedly."
						<p>"OK, I'll try after I gain my next level."
						<p>"Thank you!" And he did just that. But to no avail.
						<p>"Sorry, I killed hundreds of what should have dropped them," he said.
						<p>So that was that. Nothing to be done. The guys were now at 17 to 19 and I was still stuck at 15 getting no where.
						<p>Then a door to a great opportunity opened. It happened in Crushbone. I entered the zone to attenpt to make up for some of my wasted time. And there before me sat Draco Angelscythe, level 34 druid. "Hail, Draco," I said.
						<p>"Hi," he replied.
						<p>"Hey I was just curious. Do you have anything in the bank for sale?" He listed off a few things. Some things weren't so interesting, others I knew I wouldn't be able to possibly afford, but one thing really caught my ear: A Gigantic Zweihander. My dream sword since I found out it existed. I know there is much better now but at the time it was the best item in the game to me.
						<p>"Um....I'll give you all my blackened iron for it."
						<p>A pause.
						<p>Then he said the following statement: ".reply I'll just give him the one of the SK. Do you want the blackened or not?"
						<p>I suppose the "." in front of "reply" should have been "/".
						<p>"I'm guessing that message wasn't for me and that you have more than one Zweihander," I said.
						<p>Draco grinned. "I have seven." This was before they were lore items.
						<p>"Geez." So he agreed and we completed the transaction. With the money in my bank I purchased some banded armor to replace my blackened. Excited about my new weapon I met up with Pebbles in Felwithe to tell her about it.
						<p>"Nice!" She commented. "Can I see it in the trade window?"
						<p>So I placed the Zweihander in the window for her to see. It was at this moment that Everquest took a horrible turn and really started sucking.
						<p>The world came down.
						<p>And when it did finally come back, I was Zweihander-less.
						<p>"^%#$!%^$ EVERQUEST *^$^726 MOTHER *U@)$*@($(@* GAME (*#@)(@*#* GIVE ME @)#(_)@ MY SWORD BACK!!!!!!!!" I blurted out.
						<p>I was quick to petition.
						<p>"Sorry," the GM said. "All I can do is give crappy ass weapons to replace it." Well, she said something along those lines.
						<p>So that was that. I was without blackened armor, I was without a Zwiehander, and I had no money cause I spent it all on banded. Sometimes Everquest provided a nice escape from the stress of the life, but somehow real life manifested itself inside this virtual world, too. It was then that I began toying with the idea of starting over as a wizard. I thought that if I sold all my belongings I might be able to buy a Flowing Black Robe, so I began auctioning for one.
						<p>Then I got a message.
						<p>"Hey, this is Draco," a guy named Trekar said.

						<p>Author's Note: Man, this chapter was pretty crappy and not funny, but at least a plot is developing ;') For the most part it's true, except chapter one was completely fictionalized. Um, like, it's 1:00 here and I'm a tired mofo and I got to wake early for classes. So, like, to be continued and stuff.

						"Dude!" I replied. "You gotta help me get my Zweihander back!"
						<p>"What happened to it?" Trekar asked. I explained the story to him in full detail. "Heh, what if you're lying to me?"
						<p>"What do I need with two of them?!" I pleaded. "Come on! Pleasepleaseplease!" I was on my way to Butcherblock while this conversation was going on. I came to the zone and Draco passed me up.
						<p>"Hey!" I told Draco.
						<p>"?" was his reply.
						<p>"I'll see what I can do," Trekar told me. "No promises."
						<p>I stopped for a second. I was a bit confused by this. Draco just passed me, but Trekar who claimed to be Draco was talking to me. "I just passed Draco! How are he and you on at he same time?"
						<p>"Oh, er, that's my brother," was Trekar's reply.
						<p>"Oh..." I quickly dismissed it as unimportant.
						<p>"Hey, I got a deal," he said. "If you can get me blackened boots to finish off the other blackened you traded me then I'll get you another Zweihander. How's that?"
						<p>I sighed. That would be my luck. I knew I might as well just kiss the GZ goodbye forever. Even if I did obtain blackened boots, I wasn't sure I would be willing to give them up after all the time I had spent looking for them. I zoned into Butcherblock to hunt down Zarchoomi and Corflunk to attempt to get my blackened back. I had good luck at it, too. Within a day I was back to my old look, still lacking only the boots. I kept in touch with Trekar to see if anything could be worked out, and he offered me various trades for another Zweihander, all of which were too difficult for me to obtain.
						<p>One day, while hunting in Unrest...
						<p>"We got your boots!" Cynic told me.
						<p>"I'm on my way right now!" I quickly disbanded and began the trip to RunnyEye as fast as I could. I finally got there and found Cynic, Pebbles, and Morten along with Cycas and Talya there.
						<p>"Twenty plat," Morten said. I enthusiastically handed over the money to him. Finally, after weeks of searching and weeks of being level 15, I had them!
						<p>"Thank you guys," I said. "I think I'm gonna cry!"
						<p align="center">******
						<p>Some time later, still level 15 but at least making progress towards 16, I was grouped in Beholder Maze. In this time Trekar grew tired of being a ranger and gave way to Lanowar the High Elf Enchanter. His latest proposal was for me to get him a werewolf paw for a GZ. After doing some minor research into it and discovering their rarity I knew this was also too much for me.
						<p>"Alright," he said. "How about this?"
						<p>"I'm listening," I replied.
						<p>"Help me level this enchanter and you can get anything you want: Zweihander, Ebony Blade, whatever."
						<p>"Really?!" I exclaimed. "But...how am I going to level you?"
						<p>"The login name is drushva1, password champ22 (Note: I forget the actually PW now, but this will suffice)," he said.
						<p>So I logged out and entered the name and password he gave me. When I came to the selection screen I was surprised to see Draco as the character to select. I got the impression that he wanted me to play Lanowar for him. So this is what he meant when he said I could get anything I wanted for myself, I thought. Well, at least anything that a level 33 druid (he had lost several levels) was capable of getting. I logged in as Draco and helped Lanowar gain a level. After that I was quick to go to Everfrost to check on Karg. I didn't find him then, but it was only a few days later that he was dead and a Gigantic Zweihander was back in my hands. I had fun playing Draco. I saw and killed many things that were once god-like to me. Lanowar revealed to me Draco's real purpose, which was a tool to twink the characters of those that played him. The list was long, too, of those that played him. The original Draco didn't even play anymore. Every now and then I was called upon to help him out to help out Spicy, the only other one that played Draco at the time besides Lanowar and I. It didn't seem like a bad deal to me, to have to help them out from time to time in return for the chance to play as Draco.
						<p>One night, while I was Karg hunting again for a GZ to sell, I met up with a Vanion, Yuman, and Sumadin as they were leaving Permafrost. I revealed to them who I was and told them I was going to try to get everyone cool stuff with Draco. I decided that if I did find Karg then I would hand over his GZ to Vanion. I checked my tracker and to my surprise saw that Karg was out and about. So I chased him down and killed him, but unfortunately he carried no Zweihander on him.
						<p>"Aww..That's Ok," said Vanion. "One of these days..."
						<p>"Yeah," I said. After that they told me about some strange mysterious cavern they had found under the ice in one of the rivers in Everfrost. I followed them to see what they were talking about. I looked down though the ice and sure enough, I saw an ice goblin diver guarding an entrance to what appeared to be a cave. This had made me quite curious as to what was down below. So I cast water breathing on everyone (after waiting for Sumadin to fish up some fish scales; we would have gotten them quicker if his fishing skill weren't so high ;'P) and we dove in. The cave was huge and rather twisty. And to our disappointment it was also rather barren. All we found was a strange wizard that was aggresive to the other guys but not to me because I was in wolf form. We also ran across some ice boned skeletons and a few strange buildings, one of which teleported you back in front of it when you entered it. We had fun, though, searching the caverns. Unfortunately the next time I returned to them it would be under less favorable circumstances.

					<font face="Verdana" size="2">
						<b>Author's Note</b>: The following is completely true. Never has a video game provoked such an emotional response in me. I felt anger and disdain, but mostly frustration because I couldn't get this guy to realize how incredibly stupid he was being.
						<p>Some time later in Butcherblock under the guise of Sevastian, the still level 15 ranger...
						<p>I had at that time a combine long sword and a Qeynos Kite Shield equipped.
						<p>"Neat shield!" Someone beside me quipped. "Can I have it? Please?"
						<p>I looked towards the source of the voice, and beheld a level 7 wood elf ranger. He wasn't well equipped really, having only patchwork and a piece or two of banded armor.
						<p>"Heh," I replied. "But what would I use?"
						<p>"Ahh, come on," he pleaded. "Please."
						<p>I thought about it. I had my Zwei now and was going to be getting dual wield soon. I really didn't the shield anymore. What harm would it have been to help this guy out if he liked the shield so much?
						<p>"How's this? I am going to try and see if I can sell it real quick for a few plat. If no one takes it you can have it."
						<p>"Ok," he eagerly responded.
						<p>So I auctioned it, "Shield from Qeynos guards! Only 5pp!"
						<p>I waited about a minute and auctioned it again.
						<p>(Author's note: My stomach is churning in disgust now as I am thinking about this. You gotta understand, this REALLY pissed me off)
						<p>A voice, a shrill grating voice, shouted out: "Stop spamming my screen with that crap you stupid newbie!" The voice belonged to (ugh) Takaar.
						<p>"Dude, I was just trying to see if I could sell it before I gave it away to this guy," I shouted back.
						<p>Then he messaged me and basically repeated his first sentence with a few profanities thrown in.
						<p>I could already tell this guy had a huge ego. I figured this was some level 15ish guy that thought he was God or something so I challenged him. "Wanna duel?"
						<p>"Haha," came his reply. "Ok but you can't back down when you see me!"
						<p>"Fine, I won't!"
						<p>Takaar began broadcasting that a duel was about to take place. I got some warnings that he was a level 30 wizard. This made me a little apprehensive, but I had agreed to the duel. And if he killed me my pride would be wounded for only a short time. So I met him at the zone between Butcherblock and Greater Faydark. I extended the duel challenge and he accepted.
						<p>And then I began running towards the zone. I rounded the corner, but suddenly my feet adhered to the ground.
						<p>Dammit! I thought. It's over now. I waited but he never came around to finish me off, which he was capable of doing in two spells. Instead he began shouting out taunts and glorifying himself. He had a huge ego to be sure. The root wore off. I started towards the zone again but abrubtly stopped. Wait, I thought. I can either run or stay and attempt to do...something. What I didn't know, but something. I had two things in my favor: his ego and the fact that he was a dark elf. I camoflaged myself and turned around and headed past Takaar and the group of onlookers. He was still shouting out taunts and such and making himself look good. I went and sat inside the guard house at the crossroads.
						<p>After a few minutes he realized I was no longer rooted at the zone. "Come out and fight, coward!" Takaar shouted. Now I know hiding isn't exactly the most honorable tactic but the fact was I was level 15 and he was level 30. In a duel the point is to win, or at the very least not to lose, so I was going to attempt to do just that. Even if the guards killed him and the duel was canceled it would have been better than losing. And this is what I shouted back to him.
						<p>But he insisted on my coming out and letting him kill me. I told him I wanted to make it interesting and that he had to find me. Just to make it fair I took Camo off and began walking around in the open, still keeping a close enough distance to the guards though. I moved from the crossroads all the way down the road to Kaladim. He tried to hire a ranger to track me. The shouting back and forth between us continued, and many others joined in as well. By the time it was all over everyone had taken sides in the battle of words or had turned shout and ooc off. It soon became evident that he was at least intelligent enough to get around the guards. My only chance was to wait it out until he finally got frustrated and left. But he wouldn't! His ego wouldn't let him bear the shame of everyone seeing his name flash across the screen, proclaiming that a mere level 15 ranger had defeated him in a duel.
						<p>"Stop running!" Takaar shouted again. "Come fight!"
						<p>I again tried to explain to him that doing that would be suicidal on my part and that I was attempting to win the duel. "Why don't you just zone?" I asked. "I mean what big satisfaction is it going to give you if you kill a level 15 ranger?" I also pointed out that we'd both wasted an hour and a half, which wasn't a big deal to me really cause I wasted a lot of time on those boots, another hour with this duel fiasco wasn't too much of a concern.
						<p>After a few more feeble taunts Takaar messaged me. "Listen here you snot! If I ever see you in a dungeon you will be trained on repeatedly. I will make sure you die for this. You are also going on my guild's shitlist."
						<p>"What guild is that?" I asked.
						<p>"Dark Nova, remember that! They will also be told to train on you."
						<p>"Haha," I responded. "I've never even heard of your guild."
						<p>"You will."
						<p>A few seconds later: Sevastian has defeated Takaar in a duel to the death! Takaar has fled like a cowardly dog!
						<p>I got a few congratulations.
						<p>"Heh," Cynic messaged me.
						<p>"He was level 30 and I won!" I replied.
						<p>"Sure he was..."
						<p>Someone else messaged me, "I thought Takaar was unbeatable in a duel?" she said.
						<p>"I'm only level 15, too!" I told her.
						<p>"Really?"
						<p>"Yes, check for yourself," I said.
						<p>Butcherblock quieted down after that. People went on about their business. I gave the shield to the ranger, and went on my way. I saw Takaar once after that and he made some comment about me running away like a coward. I saw him after that on a few more occasions but he never acknowledged me.
						<p>I may have won but I was still disappointed that I hadn't damaged his ego. One day, I told myself. One day...

					<font face="Verdana" size="2">
						It was the third day of May in the year 3172 when the Phoenix Dragoons went from a vision of a small group of adventurers and became a reality. The group of ten set down on that day and drafted thier constitution and decided upon the noble Vanion as their leader.
						<p>The guild flourished from there as many of the friends of those that found the Dragoons joined. They made their mark upon Norrath as being a guild of honor and nobility. They lacked the facism displayed in many guilds and upheld a code of dignity. But, as it seems throughout all history, those who prove themselves and deserve many great things often find themselves with the most enemies. Although blessed with initial success, the road that lied ahead for the Phoenix Dragoons was to be a difficult one indeed. Only the strongest of spirits would endure the path they had chosen to follow. Only the strongest of allies would be able to help the Dragoons be victorious. And irony it seems was on the their side, as two of their strongest allies would come from a most unexpected source.
						<p>The first of these two people was Altaira Frost, Dark Elf Cleric. Her story with the Dragoons began before the guild had been formed. It goes back to one certain day in Crushbone. On this day Sevastian was also present in Crushbone. Sevastian, always looking for opportunities and seeing that she was capable of taking on Ambassador DVinn, engaged her in conversation.
						<p>"Hey, baby," Sev said to her. Charming her would be his tactic. "You're hot."
						<p>She laughed. "Thank you."
						<p>Sevastian continued with his predictably low-par flattery. Then he causually let it be know to her that he wanted to be the owner of a Dragoon Dirk. As it goes, he did not leave Crushbone with a Dirk that day, but he opened the door with Altaira. But on every subsequent occasion when their paths crossed he would always greet her with "I still think you are hot" and she would always laugh. He even got a bit of admiration from her one day in Runnyeye. He was there to get a pair of blackened iron boots from a few friends of his and Altaira also happened to be present. After he was suited up in full blackened she complimented him on his look and even tried to buy the armor from him. He politely declined her offer, but some time later he ran into her and noticed that she had aquired a set of her own blackened armor.
						<p>Once again Sevastian delivered his usually greeting to her and once again she laughed.
						<p>A seemingly insignificant encounter to say the least, but the beginning of an important alliance.
						<p>The second individual is introduced to the Dragoons under less...favorable circumstances than the first. The encounter also occurs before the formation of the Dragoons and involves Vanion, Camar, Sevastian, and Sumadin. It happened one day in High Pass Hold...
						<p>Sevastian had just arrived and joined up with Camar and Vanion. They soon began their attack on the nearest orc. The orc stood little chance and it's health began to diminish. Then, much to the dismay of the three, a magician's pet began to attack the orc. Soon after the orc was rocked by a small explosion. A few seconds later another explosion and the orc fell to the ground in a lifeless mass. Vanion, Camar, and Sevastian received no advancement for their part in slaying the orc.
						<p>The owner of the pet quickly came to claim his loot from the corpse. Vanion muttered a quick comment on stealing kills.
						<p>The Erudite magician stood up from looting with a big grin on his face. He took a seat and began to meditate. Another orc came up and the three began their attack on it. And once again the pet joined the attack. And once again the orc fell to the magician's spell casting.
						<p>Camar sighed.
						<p>Other groups in High Pass were also experiencing the same ordeal. No one was able to get any experience because this magician was taking it from them. It seemed as if he got every orc, too. He did just exactly enough damage to take the kill and he always had enough mana to take the next one too. By now everyone was a bit frustrated and had openly begun to curse him. But all he did was grin and kill the next orc that appeared. Occasionally he interjected with a snide remark but he never lost his cool or felt any remorse for his actions. He was the worst of enemies. Nothing that was said against him stirred him to anger. He calmly accepted the insults and declined all duels with a wave of indifference.
						<p>Vanion, Camar, and Sevastian were enraged by all this and lashed out at the magician more and more. To them, he was worse than the infamousTichiwawa. Sumadin arrived at High Pass during all this. He tried to thwart the magician by use of his arcane powers but the magician was still able to deal more damage against the orcs than Sumadin was capable of.
						<p>"Duel me!" Sev shouted into the magician's face.
						<p>"No," he calmly responded. "I have no reason to."
						<p>Vanion organized the groups into a plot against the magician. His idea was to train a group of orcs onto the mage. He wouldn't possibly be able to handle three at once. Everyone else was to form a line across the passage to Kithicor Forest to prevent the mage from escaping the orcs. And so everyone lined up and Sevastian pulled a group of orcs onto the mage, but unfortunately he managed to push thourgh the wall of people and they were left to battle off the orcs. And as the group fought the orcs off that they had intended for their mutual enemy, the mage once again robbed them of their kills.
						<p>Once again the insulting ensued. Amidst the bickering a voice shouted out and rose against everyone else's.
						<p>"Named gnoll!!" The voice cried out. Everyone on the orc side stopped for a second, distracted.
						<p>A pause.
						<p>"To the Gnoll side!" Sevastian shouted out. Everyone quickly began running through the twists of High Pass Hold towards the side inhabited by gnolls. Sumadin and the mage were the first to arrive at the gnoll side. They quickly threw a glance at each other and began to run up the incline to where the named gnoll would be. And both began to unleash their volley of magic. Seconds later as everyone else arrived, the gnoll lay dead, and Sumadin held victoriously above his head the Polished Granite Tomahawk that he had looted from the orc. He had succeeded against the magician.
						<p>"That's OK," said the magician, with a grin still on his face. "I've gotten several before. I'm sure I'll get them again."
						<p>"From stealing kills, no doubt," sneered Sevastian.
						<p>"But of course," he replied smugly.
						<p>"One day," Sev vowed, "we will get even with you. I won't forget your name...what is your name by the way?"
						<p>An even bigger grin spread across the Erudite's face. "Doomstalker Fearstrike. I hope you don't forget it."
						<p>And so began the unexpected alliance with Doomstalker. Introduced as an enemy he would later teach the four Dragoons present that day in High Pass a lesson on humilty. The two parties involved were enemies for sure, but the prime difference between them was that Doomstalker had respect for his opponents whereas the others had none for him. That was the lesson he would later teach, that even their enemies deserved their respect.
						<p>With a casual friendship and a rivalry where only one party was bitter, Fate had sewn it's seeds into the Dragoons and provided an unexpected source of strength.
