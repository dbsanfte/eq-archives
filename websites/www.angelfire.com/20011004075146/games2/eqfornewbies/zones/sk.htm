         The Southern Plains of Karana are the sothernmost portion of the vast Plains of Karana,
     in western Norrath. This zone is populated mostly by animals of all sorts. That feature
     gives it its most prominent danger. If you kill enough lions, for example, all the
     lions here (and everywhere else on Norrath) will attack you on sight. The same goes
     for bears, wolves, elephants, etc. However, if you can avoid that, this is a relatively
     safe zone. There are no Hill Giants, no griffons. There are only two really dangerous
     creatures: Cracktusk and Lord Grimrot. Cracktusk is an immense elephant that will attack
     you on sight. Not only is he very high-level, he's fast like a mofo. Only a SoWed
     player can have any hope of escaping this monster. Additionally, he can usually
     detect you from farther away that you can see him. Fortunately, he spawns rarely.
     Lord Grimrot is a very high-level NPC that appears as two forms: a human in full plate armor carrying
     a scythe, and as a skeleton. Both of these forms are deadly. Stay away if you value your
     life. However, there are many benefits to this zone. First of all is that
     monsters are very plentiful here. Another is that this zone is immense. This means
     that the player population is spread pretty thin, and you can have whole areas to yourself
     if you're lucky. Yet another is that the zone is just plain <i>cool</i>. The inhabitants
     are varied and many. There are many races that can't be found except for a handful of other 
     zones anywhere else on Norrath, such as Aviaks, centaurs, Treants, a Pegasus, etc. All
     this makes for a diverse and interesting hunting environment.
     You can solo or group here, it doesn't really matter.
         <p>
         <font size="5">Final Verdict</font><p>
         A great zone to hunt in, solo or with a group. Just watch out for Cracktusk and Grimrot.
     Make sure you don't kill too many animals, or you'll have the entire animal population
     of Norrath after you.
