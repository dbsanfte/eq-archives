     <font size="5">Magician Strategies</font>
     <p>
     Magicians are one of the coolest and most powerful classes in the game. They are
masters of summoning things. Among the objects they can summon are pets. Once you hit level 4, Magicians can summon powerful elementals to do their
bidding. This allows you to attack a mob while sitting on your butt and medding. Pets are like
portable tanks, only you can control them. In addition to this versatile tool, you have the ability
to summon weapons, food, water, bandages, and other miscellanious and useful objects. You also
have powerful DD spells, second only to those of the Wizard. Magicians are a very versatile class,\
and a good deal of fun to play.<p>

<p>
     <a name="#1"></a><br>
     <li><b>Rank 1: 1 - 4</b><br>
     This is a pretty basic and boring rank. The only notable spells are Burst of Flame, a DD, 
Minor Shielding, a self-only buff spell, and summon food/water. Always keep the shielding
active, as it will save your butt several times. The DD is useful for pulling a mob to you,
or casting in between hits. Summon food/water frees you from ever having to buy food again.
Your melee skills are halfway decent at this level, so that is how you'll kill most of your foes.
Stay solo, you want to get to level 4 as soon as possible, because things get a lot more interesting at...
     
     <p>
     <a name="#2"></a><br>
     <li><b>Rank 2: 4 - 8</b><br>
     This is where Magicians start to rock. You get your first pet spells, a new DD, Gate, and
summon bandages. The pet spells are called "Elementalkin: Water/Fire/Earth/Air." This opens up
a whole new world for you. More info on pets <a href="#pet">here</a>. You will use these all
the time from now on, so get used to them. The new DD is useful, as is Gate, which transports
you back to your bind point. Summon bandages allows you to use the Bind Wound skill for free,
which is nice since you don't have a healing spell. At this rank you can group or solo, whichever
you prefer. I would suggest soloing, because once again, you want to get to Rank 3 <b>fast</b>
     
     <p>
     <a name="#3"></a><br>
     <li><b>Rank 3: 9 - 14</b><br>
     An awesome level for Magicians. New and more powerful pets are the main attraction here. However,
there are a bunch of nifty spells here, like Eye of Zomm, which summons a floating eye that you
can control. Basically, it allows you to scout an area before entering it, and you can cast spells
from the eye, making it useful for pulling creatures without exposing yourself. You also get two new DD's, Shock of Blades and Flame
Bolt. Note that to use this spell you must have a direct line-of-sight to your target. You'll also get 
Renew Elements, a pet-only healing spell. Also useful for your pets is Staff of Tracing, which summons a magical
staff that you can give to your pet. Shield of Fire is a nice fire-based Damage Shield, and goes nicely
with your pet. Finally we have Invisibility, which, surprisingly enough, makes the target invisible.
This is pretty useful for a corpse run. At this rank, you can still solo or group, although grouping
is preferable, simply because it's more fun.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#create"></a><br>
     <li><b>Creating your Magician</b><br>
     The main stat for Magicians is Intelligence. This determines how much mana you have.
Five races can be Magicians: Dark Elves, High Elves, Erudites, Humans, and Gnomes.
Of these, Humans are by far the worst, because they have very low Intelligence, as well
as no night vision. All the others are relatively equal, but have their pros and cons. Dark
Elves have high Intelligence but are evil, and therefore KOS in many places. Erudites have the
highest Intelligence, but also have a really crappy starting point. Gnomes have high Intelligence
and start in <a href="../zones/steamfont.htm">Steamfont</a>, a great zone. High Elves have decent
Intelligence, and a great starting location. Which race you pick is really a matter of preference.
          
     <p>
     <a name="#group"></a><br>
     <li><b>Your role in a group</b><br>
     The Magician is a multi-faceted class, and can do many things that are beneficial
     to a group. 
<ol><li><b>Nuking</b><br>You can nuke pretty darn well, second only to Wizards. This is useful
for stopping runners or speeding up a battle a little bit.
<li><b>Pets</b><br>Sic your pet on the mob and watch it drop. Pets make great and expendable tanks,
so send it right into the fray and whack away.
<li><b>Damage Shields</b><br>Everyone loves these. Every time a mob whacks that person, it takes
a few damage. The first DS you get is Shield of Fire. It only does a few damage, but that damage
can really add up over time.
<li><b>Summoning</b><br>You can summon all sorts of stuff useful to a group, like food, water, 
bandages, and weapons. These things will make life much easier for everyone involved.     
</ol>     
<p>
     <a name="#solo"></a><br>
     <li><b>Soloing</b><br>
     Magicians are masters of solo, for a simple reason: pets. These guys can whack away
at a mob, taking and receiving damage, while you sit and med. Stand up every once in a while
and pop off a nuke, because if you don't outdamage your pet, it wil take <b>half</b> the experience
from your kill, which is not cool. Always use your Damage Shields on the pet, because it makes
the mob die quicker, which is always good. Soloing isn't too complicated, but there is one tactic you
should know about. It's called Resummoning, and it will save your ass and allow you to take on mobs
much higher than you. Basically, you have the pet attack the mob until it gets to about 1/4 health
(find out its health by using /pet report health). Once it gets there, start casting a new pet spell.
You can't summon a pet when another one exists, so when the pet spell gets to within 1 bubble of going off,
type "/pet get lost" which makes the pet suicide. As soon as that one pops, a new one will appear - with full health.
You can guess the rest.

     <li><b>Pet Management</b><br>
     When used correctly, elementals will save you countless times and allow you to solo and
group effectively. When used incorrectly, pets will get you killed time and time again. You
have to know how to control your pet. A few notes on pet survivability: If you cast invisibility
on yourself, the pet will do 32,000 damage to itself. Yeah, ouch. Also, pets disappear whenever
you zone. This is really no fun either, but apparently unavoidable.
 There are a few basic commands you need to know: 
<ol>
<li><b>/pet follow me</b><br>
The pet follows you (duh), attacking only what you attack or what attacks you.
<li><b>/pet attack</b><br>
The pet attacks whatever you have targeted.
<li><b>/pet sit</b><br>
The pet sits down and rests, and won't do anything unless you're attacked or you give it another
command.
<li><b>/pet back off</b><br>
The pet stops fighting and returns to your side, usually pulling the monster with it. If it gets hit,
however, it will turn around and fight again. This makes pets a good "fishing line" as they can
pull the monster to you if needed.
<li><b>/pet as you were</b><br>
The pet forgets any commands you gave it.</ol>
You should have <a href="general.htm#hot">hotkeys</a> made for each of these so you make
commands instantly when needed.<br><b>Controlling pets</b><br>When you're in a dungeon,
issuing the wrong command can send your pet flying off in an unknown direction, and you
won't see it again until it comes running back to you, followed by 3 or 4 mobs. Keep your
pet on a tight leash, and if it gets too far away from you, execute the "/pet get lost" command,
which suicides the pet. Not fun, but necessary. If the pet is so far that it can't hear the command,
you are in deep trouble. The only thing you can is cast invisibility on yourself.<br><b>Keeping pets alive</b><br>
While in battle, execute the "/pet health report"
command from time to time. The pet then lets you know its health status. If it gets too low, cast your pet healing spell, or
have it back off, stand up, and cast some nukes at the mob to get its attention. Take some hits,
and when your pet is healed (or you're low on health) sit down and send the pet in. If you manage
your pet wisely, it should never die, except when you zone.<br><b>Maximizing Pet Effectiveness</b><br>Buff it, put Damage Shields on it, give it weapons
(how about those summoned weapons you can get?). When giving pets weapons, remember that weapon
delay doesn't matter, as the pets have their own delay stats. When summoning pets, you will usually get an elemental of equal level to the pet spell, plus or minus a few.
It's always best to get a pet above the spell, and, if possible, above you. If you get a dud pet,
cast the reclaim energy spell, which gives you mana in return for killing the pet, and summon a new one.
Take care of your pet, and it will take care of
you.

     <li><b>Pet Types</b><br>
     There are four types of pets that you can summon: fire, earth, water, and air. Each has its
advantages and disadvantages.
<ol>
<li><b>Earth</b><br>
This pet has immense hit points, but low agility. This means that it will take lots of hits, 
but can still keep going. It has the special ability of rooting the mob, which means that
it won't come after you. It does average damage and has average delay. It tends to be below
or equal to the level of the pet spell. This is the best pet for soloing, as the Root ability
allows you to cast DD spells without worrying about the mob coming after you.
<li><b>Fire</b><br>
This pet is pretty amazing. It has a built-in fire-based damage shield, which is pretty incredible
in its own right. Add to that the fact that this pet does the most damage of any elemental, and
you have a powerful weapon. It tends to summon at or above the level of the pet spell, so it
takes fewer hits than the Earth, but it also has low HP, so be prepared to take some blows or
use the heal spell to keep it alive.
<li><b>Air</b><br>
One of the best pets out there, if you know how to use it. It casts invisibility on itself when not
in combat, useful if you're a PvP player or you're infiltrating a dungeon. Also, with every attack it has a chance
to proc Stun, which stuns the mob (duh) for a few seconds. With its short attack delay, this happens
pretty often. This makes it great for attacking spellcasting mobs, as this can interrupt the spell. At higher levels, a popular trick is to give the Air pet two Gnoll Hide Lariats,
which also have a chance to proc Stun... the mob will be Stunned 60% of the time. Dirty, but effective.
This pet is <b>very</b> hard to hit.
<li><b>Water</b><br>
This pet does average damage and has an average delay, but it also has an excellent AC, meaning
less hits, and a chance to proc a cold-based DD on the mob. Sweet! This is basically a well-rounded
pet, and you will use it alot.
</ol>
Your two main pets at lower levels are Earth and Water, but the others have their moments. Get used
to the pets, and your favorite will emerge.

     <a name="#summon"></a><br>
     <li><b>Summoning</b><br>
     Besides the obvious pets, mages can summon a good deal of stuff that is very useful in any situation.
When you log out or go LinkDead, however, all of these items will disappear.
<ol>
<li><b>Weapons</b><br>
The mage can summon some decent weapons, all of which are magic, and can hit magic creatures (ghouls, wisps).
Give these weapons to your pets or group members, or equip one yourself.
<li><b>Supplies</b><br>
Mages can summon food, water, and bandages. This lets you save money, and your life, in the case
of bandages.
<li><b>Containers</b><br>
Mages can also summon dimensional pockets, which weigh nothing and reduce the weight of objects
in them to nothing as well. This is useful for carrying loot without being encumbered. However,
it's important to note that like all other summoned objects, this will disappear when you log or
go LD. And when it disappears, everything in it will disappear, too.</ol>
