<h1 align="center">History of the Sintarros</h1>

<body><P>
They were once a highly-respected and well-built house.  All members were powerful mages, titan wizards, gothic necromancers, and charming enchanters.  They were the "Sintarros".  They dedicated their lives to the study of magic and shared fellowship with other members.  Every part of their lives was enchanced by magic. "If man can do it, magic can do it better."...was their motto.<P>

Their house and alliance was strong and long-lived.  They ruled the country side with an iron first, though they were not a violent guild.  They much rahter use magic peacefully before resulting in war-magic.  They lived in Norrath for over thousand years, constantly inducting new members to follow their traditions.<P>

It was then in the "Year of the Dragons", that things began to change.  It was until this time the Sintarros had control.  Mighty dragons began to descend upon the lands; crushing the ground they lay foot upon and the Sintarro control.  Havok rippled through the lands.  The dragons "Lady Vox" and "Lord Nagena" became known to all.  The townships became abandoned in fear of their attacks.  House of Sintarro was in a state of chaos as many members left to defend themselves in the wilds.  Organization was merely a word.  After this time, little historical records could be found to illustrate what happened next.<P>

Then one hundred years later, in a small village, dominated by casting professions, a groups of children would often tell others of the many stories of the Sintarro.  One group of mid-teen children especially paid close attention to the stories.  There was nine of them.  They would often dream of forming powerful alliances and becoming powerful mages themselves.  It was then these scholars of arcane ways decided to do what they had dreamed of.  They formed their guild and tried to use every aspect of the Sintarro House as possible.  Their goals continue to thrive today as they make their ways into Norrath.
