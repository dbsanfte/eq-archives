         The East Commonlands are situated near the eastern coast of Antonica.
     The zone itself is somewhat of a hub, as it's connected
     to four other zones. There are spaces here for both low- and high-
     level newbies. The monsters are plentiful, and can offer some
     great hunting if you're in a group. However, there are dangers
     here, and they are great. The main danger are the griffins. They
     fly around the zone, attacking whoever they see without provocation. 
     And whoever they
     attack ends up dead. If you see one, either <b>a)</B> put on an invisibility 
     spell or <b>b)</B> run like hell. People in the zone will sometimes call
     out "Griff at Inn #." They are referring to the four inns scattered
     throughout the zone. The inns are numbered 1 to 4, 1 being the one closest
     to Freeport. Learn to recognize these warnings. There are other randomly aggressive 
     creatures, such as orcs and undead, but the danger is less from them.
     If you stay as close to guards as possible while hunting, you can 
     sometimes escape some pretty tough spots, but it's no sure thing.
     The zone is also used as a marketplace and stopoff for people traveling
     to other areas. Here you can buy armor, food, throwing daggers, arrows,
     gems, pottery supplies, whatever. And if a merchant doesn't have what
     you want, a player might. People often hold bazaars or events in the
     tunnel to North Ro. No monsters come in this tunnel, so if you're looking
     for a place to rest, this is it.
         <p>

         Hunting is very dangerous because of the griffins. If you feel that
         you can protect yourself, then this place has plentiful cannon fodder
     	 for you. However, if you decide that the danger is too great, I would suggest using this
     	 place as a waypoint on your journeys to other zones. Stock up on food, arrows, whatever
     	 you need, and move on.<p>
