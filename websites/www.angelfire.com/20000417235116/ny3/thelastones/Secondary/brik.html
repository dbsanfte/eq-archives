    &nbsp;&nbsp; Brik was once a happy troll. He had a loving mother and father, and a <br>
    happy home in the swamp. His main goal in life was to inherit the family <br>
    business, that of making Bricks and building structures.<br>
    But one day a long time ago, a tragic event would shake Brik's life forever. <br>
    While on the job making his famous Brik's Bricks, his contractor came by and <br>
    laid him off. Outraged, he demanded an explanation for this course of <br>
    events. The response he got was that his Bricks were too costly and labor <br>
    too high. He also learned that a band of froglocs were moving into his <br>
    territory, and they where making bricks that were cheaper and working faster <br>
    then one troll alone could do. So in a fit of furry, Brik did what his <br>
    father always preached him to do, &quot;If ya can't beat them, Kill 'em!&quot; and <br>
    that is exactly what Brik did. He went to grobb and became a shadow Knight <br>
    that promised to vanquish all Froglocs from his swamp, and to reclaim his <br>
    birthright as the best Brik maker and layer in the swamp.</font></li>
