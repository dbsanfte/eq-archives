<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Omarguk, aka Omar,
spent much of his younger bashing days killing froglok's <br>
in the swamps of Innothule. Every once in a while he would gather enough <br>
courage to provoke a swamp alligator or venture into upper guk to get some <br>
fresh &quot;meats&quot;.&nbsp; As a young troll, Omar had many pleasant memories and a few
<br>
not so pleasant.&nbsp; One of his finer moments was during his eleventh lvl <br>
during the Troll Ogre Bash O'rama, where he won both of his matches with his <br>
competing Ogres.&nbsp; Omar quickly outgrew Innothule Swamp and moved to SRO, <br>
then to Oasis at lvl 14.&nbsp; This area was great for experience and still <br>
provided a huge supply of gator meat. Also, this is where he gained most of <br>
his bronze armor. However, Omar learned that most of the &quot;humies&quot; here did <br>
not like him.&nbsp; This racial hatred was something Omar learned to deal with <br>
quickly.&nbsp; He began to learn how to travel without being noticed by those <br>
discriminatory races.&nbsp; These travel tactics allowed Omar to move throughout <br>
Norath without being noticed.&nbsp; These places were essential for him to <br>
complete his crafted armor quests.&nbsp; Upon his adventures Omar had much fun <br>
hunting/questing with the &quot;TLO&quot; guild members.&nbsp; Just to name a few: Goad, <br>
Izzy, Ultigar, Rykar, Koramar, and even little Sheltem.&nbsp; Currently Omar is <br>
hunting in Cazic Thule.&nbsp; He has successfully ventured into various sections <br>
of Lower Guk. In the near future, Omar and Goad plan on an adventure to <br>
MistMoore Keep to complete his final Crafted Armor quest-the breast plate. <br>
Goad and Omar have gallantly fought side by side during all the crafted <br>
armor quests. Omar knows there is nothing we can't accomplish together as <br>
knights of the &quot;TLO's&quot;.</font></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6" color="#FFFFFF">Medal of
Merit</font></strong></p>

<p align="left">For meritorious conduct and generosity toward other knights of TLO over
and beyond the limits of the ordinary player. Awarded to recipients who have over the
course of time, proven to be recognized for their acts of generosity towards other
members, be it giving out low level loot to needy player, giving out various trade skill
items, or for just continually giving of a players time and effort helping members camp or
track down items without asking for compensation for themselves. Omarguk has been
nominated for his endeavors in Guk helping members there, and I wholeheartedly endorse his
merit as he has been a contributing member of TLO for many a long months and has helped us
all along the way. Omarguk continues to serve The Last Ones with dignity, honor, and
selflessness, 3 cheers to Omarguk,,, glug ,,,glug ,,,glug ,,,Buuuurp!<br>
