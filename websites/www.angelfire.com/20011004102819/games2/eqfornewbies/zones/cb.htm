         Crushbone is the home of the Crushbone Orcs. Located directly
     north of the elven city of Kelethin and northwest of the High Elven
     city of Felwithe, these two races are constantly
     at war with each other. Orcs venture out of their lair to wreak havoc
     in the Greater Faydark, and elves from the nearby cities come here in droves
     to lay some good old-fashioned smackdown on the ugly brutes. I would
     suggest being at least level 5 before venturing in here. At any
     level below that, almost everything in the zone can kill you easily.
     Once you're at that level, however, things get a lot better. This
     place is <b>very</B> profitable, money-wise. Almost all the orcs
     carry some sort of armor or weapon. Most of the Orc Centurions and Legionnaires carry
     Crushbone Belts, which can be used in a quest for more experience and
     money or just sold to another player. They usually fetch around 1 pp
     each in <a href="gfay.htm">Greater Faydark</a>. Solo or grouped, there are a few spots
     here that always pay off nicely.
     One is at the bridge that you face when you come out of the cave. If you
     step back from it a little, you can watch 4 spawn points at once.
     The other is at the other bridge, to the left of the cave exit. If you
     sit a little back from it with your back to the wall, you have access to
     a glorious 6 spawn points. There are also three higher-level areas that are often
     camped (groups recommended). One is on top of the hill you see just outside the entrance.
     Up here, a few orcs spawn, as well as the Orc Trainer, who sometimes carries the coveted
     Shiny Brass Shield. Another is off in the northwestern corner. This area is known as the slave
     pits, and a good group can pull from the nearby mines and get good, consistent EXP. There 
     are a few disadvantages, however.
     One is that it's almost always crowded. As one of my hunting buddies
     so eloquently put it, "Crushbone? That place is a zoo!" Which pretty much
     sums it up. Try to avoid this by going on off-peak hours. Another danger
     are trains. Every twenty minutes or so you'll see a character running to
     the zone, pursued by a bunch of Orcs. Usually, a train consists of a few Legos, 
     2 or 3 high-level Centurions, and if you're really unlucky, a few Orcs from the castle. This is bad news. Stay away if you 
     value your life.
         <p>
         <font size="5">Final Verdict</font><p>
         Soloing works best at levels 5-8. If you want to do that, come at
         off-peak hours to avoid the crowds. If you time it right
      	 you can make some serious cash and XP. Starting around 10, you can group
     	 and go after bigger fish in here.<p>
