         The Western Plains of Karana is a vast and expansive area that makes up the western
     portion of the huge plains of Karana, in the west of Antonica. This is a pretty good place
     to hunt. There is little danger here - the only wandering creatures that will attack you
     on sight are the Hill Giants and grizzly bears. If you have killed any animals in your
     life, you'll regret it walking around here; all animals of that type will now attack
     you on sight. Aside from that, however, the only attack-on-sight monsters are in camps
     and can easily be avoided. Even if you do get jumped, there are generally guards nearby
     to help you - although they probably can't save you from that Hill Giant. There is
     a downside to hunting here, and that is that the monsters here have little to no
     loot of any real worth. The only way to make any cash is to kill animals (of which there are many) for their pelts,
     and, well... you know where that leads. On the other hand, this place is great for Druids
     at this and higher levels because of their animal-oriented spells. Other than that, however, there's no reason <b>not</B>
     to hunt here. As previously mentioned, there are guards all over. Additionally, the zone
     is ridiculously uncrowded; 30 people would be a lot here. And when the zone is as huge
     as this, you can whole regions to yourself.Also, you will never have to leave the zone for anything. You can both buy food and sell
     loot here. The only imaginable problem is that of finding
     monsters wandering around here. Therefore, grouping or partnering with a ranger is a good idea.
         <p>
         <font size="5">Final Verdict</font><p>
         A great zone to hunt in. Few wandering attack-on-sight monsters, and plenty of stuff to kill.
     Plenty of guards to save your butt if you get into trouble. You can buy food and sell loot
     here. There isn't much in the way of cash to be had, however.
