         The Southern Desert of Ro is the southern portion of the vast Desert of Ro, located
     along the southeastern coast of Antonica. This area is safer then the rest of the
     desert, as it is made primarily for newbies. There are much fewer sand giants and
     madmen roaming about. There are, however, more wandering undead that will attack you
     on sight. The northern portion is covered in sand dunes and is much like the two
     desert areas above it. The southern portion, on the the other hand, is grassy and
     covered with orc camps. These orcs are around levels 6 - 11, and make for some greatgroup hunting around those levels. If you have a spell that allows you to take 
     on camps solo (Harmony, Lull, Mesmerize), this is a great place to hunt, as it's uncrowded, and
     the orcs are plentiful. However, since this area is very hilly, it's easy to 
     run over a hill and right into an orc camp that you didn't know was there. Another 
     danger is that of the ghouls. These wander around attacking all they see, and one hit
     from them roots you to the ground, making it impossible to run... this can really
     ruin your day. Aside from that, however, there are no real dangers, making this a 
     great hunting zone. You could come here and solo to level 15, and group to around
     level 12. For soloers, the plentiful orcs in the southern area make for great hunting.
     Groups could attack the Dervish camps in the north or Orc camps in the south. Either 
     way is good, because the zone is generally uncrowded. As a small bonus, there is a 
     merchant group in the middle that will sell to just about everyone. Be sure you /con
     them before approaching, however.
         <p>
         <font size="5">Final Verdict</font><p>
         A good newbie hunting zone. Few dangers and plentiful monsters. Group or go solo, 
     whatever floats your boat.<p>
