     <font size="5">Warrior Strategies</font>
     <p>
     Warriors are tanks in their purest form. Uncomplicated by songs or spells, Warriors
     are damage machines, pure and simple. They rely on brute force to get the job done.
     They are the ones in front, taking the hits and replying in kind while the casters
     sit back and cast their spells. And in the end, it's the Warrior that gets the most
     praise.<p>

     <p>
     <a name="#1"></a><br>
     <li><b>Level 5: Bind Wounds</B><br>
     This is a useful skill to have. Basically, when activated, it allows you
     to recover health much more quickly. You can heal up to 50% of your HP bar
     in this fashion. When you get really good at it, you can recover 22 HP per tick.
     However, this skill sucks down money like a vacuum. Every time you do it, it
     consumes a bandage. Bandages cost about 2 silver, That's not very much, but when
     you need to activate the skill 5 times to get it to work, that's 1 GP right there.
     Eventually, you'll get good enough at it that you can do it with just one bandage.
     Despite the cost of this skill, however, it will probably save your butt quite a few
     times. Invest enough time and money in it, and it will start paying off.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#2"></a><br>
     <li><b>Level 6: Dodge</B><br>
     Dodge is the first of many skills like it that you'll get. Basically, it increases
     the chance that the enemy will miss you. You don't need to activate it, as it 
     functions automatically. So really, all this does is increase your AC. Not a big deal.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#3"></a><br>
     <li><b>Level 9: Bash</B><br>
     This is a very useful skill. It's alot like the skill Kick, i.e. it's a secondary
     attack that does a few extra points of damage. However, there are some very important
     differences. First of all, you need to be wearing a shield to use this skill.
     Second, it does less damage. Third, it can stun the enemy for a few seconds, allowing
     you to get in a hit or two without retaliation. Fourth, and possibly most important,
     you can interrupt enemy spellcasters, which normal attacks can't do. You have to
     manually activate the skill every time you want to use it, which can get pretty 
     annoying, but assigning it to a <a href="general.htm#hot">hot button</a> makes it easier.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#create"></a><br>
     <li><b>Creating your Warrior</B><br>
     Every class, except for Erudites and High Elves, can be a Warrior. There are four main
	races for Warriors. First of all are the Halflings. Really, the only reason you'd want
to be a Halfling is that they level faster than any of the others (in fact, faster than any
other race-class combo). However, there
     are only three real choices for Warriors. Those races are Ogres, Trolls, and Barbarians.
     The reason these three are superior to the others is that they have the highest Strength
     and Stamina, the main attributes of a Warrior. Also, they have the natural ability to
     Slam, which almost exactly like <a href="#3">Bash</a> except that you don't need a shield.
     All of these three races have their advantages and disadvantages. Barbarians start next to an excellent
     newbie area, <a href="../zones/everfrost.htm">Everfrost</a>, and are a "Good" race, meaning that
     they are accepted all across Norrath except in "Evil" areas. Also, unlike Trolls and
     Ogres, they can wear
     medium-sized armor, which is both cheaper and lighter. However, they lack
     the ability to see in the dark, and they are the weakest stat-wise of the three
     classes. Ogres are the strongest stat-wise of the three races. However, they
     are also the dumbest, so your skills will raise slowly. They are an Evil race,
     so you will have to avoid Good guards and cities. Trolls are right in the
     middle of Barbarians and Ogres, stat-wise. They are also Evil, but they have
     the natural ability to regenerate, meaning that they recover HP faster, which
     is a good thing to have as a Warrior. These three races are pretty-well
     balanced, so which you pick is a matter of personal preference.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#group"></a><br>
     <li><b>Your role in a group</B><br>
     In short, your role in the group is to whack. Whack at everything. When your
     group encounters a mob, whack it. Don't stop whacking until a) it's dead or b) 
     you're dead. Trust your group members to keep you healthy through the fight.
     While you're whacking, you have to make sure that you keep the mobs off
     the casters. This another of the Warrior's jobs: keeping the casters safe.
     Casters aren't meant to take a lot of hits. If they do, that means that a)
     you're not doing your job and b) they're screwed. You are a shield
     that the casters need to live. You're gonna be in the thick of the fight
     the entire time. This means that if something goes wrong, you're probably
     going to be the first to die. Remember that. Every group needs a tank, and
     tanking is what Warriors do best.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#solo"></a><br>
     <li><b>Soloing</B><br>
     If you like soloing, you'd better get in all the soloing you can at low levels,
     because it's not gonna happen when you get older. Warriors are not good at soloing.
     It's that simple. At lower levels, soloing is no problem, because mobs at your level generally 
     have less HP than you do, and hit softer. And when one starts running, you can
     kill it with a few hits. When you hit the teens, however, this changes. Mobs
     are tougher and harder to kill. Also, they will
     start running earlier, when it still takes a while to kill them. If you don't pursue
     a damaged mob, it will come back later, generally at the worst possible moment.
     If you do, there's the chance that you will run into one of its comrades. Either
     way, you're screwed. There is also the problem of recovering HP. You heal slowly
     by yourself - at higher levels, it can take 20 minutes of sitting there to get
     from 10% to full health. There are a myriad of other problems involving Warriors
     by themselves, but I won't go into them. All of them can be solved by having a group.
     
     
     <p>
     <a name="#equip"></a><br>
     <li><b>Equipment</B><br>
     Equipment is vital to a Warrior. How good your equipment is defines how good your
     Warrior is. You should always have the best possible equipment. This means you'll
     have to save a lot of money. This shouldn't be too much of a problem, however, since
     you don't to pay for spells or songs or anything else, just food, armor, and weapons.
     Use the <a href="general.htm#economy">player market</a> to get the best deals on
     whatever you need. You should always be looking for ways to improve your AC or
     weapon stats. Equipment is the lifeblood of a Warrior.
