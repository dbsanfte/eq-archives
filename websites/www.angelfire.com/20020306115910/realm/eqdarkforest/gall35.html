<p>
The following is a list of the various NPC that rangers need to kill while doing their Etched Ivy Quests.  I have listed the lvls of various NPC's.  However, rangers who are hunting these NPC's are advised to have the help of a full party.  Because like Divnn (in the Crushbone castle) and Dorn (in the North Ro), some of these NPC's are much more dangerous than they con.  While some of these NPCs are found in the remotley safe outdoor zones, others are in the Nasty Ole Dungeons.<br><b>Play it safe and bring a full party of your friends with you when you go to take down these mobs</B><p>
