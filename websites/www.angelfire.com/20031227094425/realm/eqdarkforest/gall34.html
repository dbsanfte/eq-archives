<div align="center"><img src="velious_logo.gif"></div>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You watch the icebergs pass, as the strange steampowered ship slowly chops its way through the icy waters. Breifly you reflect on how terribly cold this continent is rumored to be. You close your eyes and remember the rumors that were being told mostly in the bars in Freeport about a Frozen wasteland being discovered. It was said that Velious was a terrible land filled with Giants and Dragons, but also a land in which Great riches were reported to be found. But most of the rumors talked of the harsh winds and adventurers who never returned, or were eventually found frozen to death. You find yourself suddenly torn from your thoughts as a cold strong wind blows open your cloak before dying. Grining a tight lipped smile you conclude that at least some things said of Velious' were correct, and still the temperature continutes to drop as the ship drives on. Eventually the ship reaches a small dock and a nearby outpost of Igloos. You gather your belongings and walk down the planks reaching the docks, where you pause. You look out into the far distance at leaden skies which seem to boil as they approach the small outpost from the east, no doubt bringing heavy snows, and for just a second you think you see the sihoutte of a dragon in those skies. You stare eastward but see nothing and eventually assume that you were mistaken and that your imagination is running wild. You turn to watch as the Gnomes unload the ships cargo and carry these supplies towards the igloos. You take a long hard look at the empty frozen waste lands around you, before heading towards the igloos...<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>

<b>Lvl 36</B><u>Arriving at Velious</u><br>Right so you have just arrived at Velious.  First things First.  Try to get a bind at the docks if possible, <i>[Odds are it won't be possible to get a bind since Velious is usually a bring your own party kind of place]</i>and then head towards the gnomes Igloo's and buy the ranger spell "Call of Sky".  Once you have this spell scribbled within your spell book, cast Sow upon your self, cammo up and then head south west jumping from Iceberg to Iceberg as you work your way towards the Dragon bridge to the mainland.  <i>Faction Notice</i>Do Not Kill the Gnolls in the IceClad zone yet!  You might want to have them make you a new mask later (See Quest Below).<p>

<u>Getting a Bind, and Finding other Adventurers in these barren, frozen, and dangerous Wastelands.</u><br>If you desire a bind you are going to have to travel a very long and dangerous ways.  After crossing the Dragon bridge into the Eastern Wastes, head NorthEast and cross the wastes heading roughly for loc neg 1780, pos 5756 looking for a long narrow canyon <i>This is the zoneline for the Great Divide</i>.  Keep your cammo up and your eyes open for griffions which hunt players in this zone.  And remember that the Griffions are faster than a fleeing ranger with SOW.  Just about the time you think that coming to velious was a mistake you will reach a canyon.  Keep heading East thru the narrow canyon and you will eventually zone into the Great Divide.  Again keep heading east thru the Great Divide and eventually you will run into a river.  Follow this river North and you will come to a beautiful waterfall.  If you go behind the waterfall you will find the hidden city of Thurgadin<i> (the city of the Coldain Dwarves)</i>.  Thurgadin is the hub of Velious, so your ranger should be able to safley get a bind, bank, sell and buy supplies here, as well as, meet some other adventurers. <i>(Typically this is where most parties are formed before setting out to explore Velious).</i><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>

<u>The Crystal Caverns</u><br>[History]<br>The Crystal Caverns were built by the first Dwarves who settled on Velious <i> read: became ship wrecked on Velious</i>.  Upon discovering that Giants were native to Velious, the Dwarves consturcted a labyrinth (the Crystal Caverns)of ice where they  could hide from the frost giants.  These caverns were constructed to be a labyrinth of passageways, and had many traps that were hoped would stop the giants should they ever find the Dwarven Hideout.  Origionally the crystal caverns were the salvation of the first Dwarves who had become marooned upon Velious; as it allowed them to survive the harsh environment of Velious, and eventually a keep was constructed within the heart of the caverns known as Froststone.  However, some (50-80) years later the native giants discovered the location of the Dwarves home.  And upon discovering the location of Frostone, a giant by the name of Slagd Frozentoe lead an invasion of Giant Warroirs into the caverns in an attempt to exterminate the Colin Dwarves.  After the long battle the dwarves survived, but knew that they could not stay at their discovered home for eventually the giants would return, in greater force.  And so the Coldain abandoned the caverns and set out to find a new home; eventually coing to the Great Divide.  It was here that the dwarves settled and built a new fortress.  This new fortress was dug deep into the heart of a mountain and was heavily constructed of Narrow passageways to be easily defended against a Giant Invasion.  For the Coldain Dwarves were determined not to lose this home as they had their last.  The Dwarves named this new Coldain Stronghold Thurgadin.<p>Today much of the remains of the Crystal Caverns (CC) are overun by the Ry'Gorr orcs who have built a fortress over the entrance to the Caverns.  Typically there are two ways to hunt within these caverns.  One way is to get a full party and then proceed to break in.   The party will be chopping and hacking its way thru the multitude of orcs as it moves down the flights of narrow staircases and cross narrow bridges in an attempt to reach the bottom of the pit.  The second way is to solo the caverns.  To do this cammo up, and cast a levitate upon yourself and then float to the bottom of the pit.  Upon reaching the bottom of the pit a ranger can then begin to pull orcs towards the nearby remains of Frostone.  However, at this point I think I should mention two specific dangers about soloing in the CC, one of which makes soloing in the CC unforgetable.  The First Danger: inorder to leave you will need to either get an evac or find a group with whom you can join/follow as they carve their way through the mobs back towards the surface.  And the Second danger is that occasionally a player in a party who is working their way down into the CC from the surface will fall into the pit (usually the result of a fight on the narrow bridges).  When this happens a train  will form as the orcs race down in a race to reach the bottom of the pit.  When the player runs into the nearby remains of Frostone, you can expect all hell to break loose.  Because in a few seconds a train of orcs anywhere from 30-50 in number are about to overrun the handful of Coladin Guards, and come pouring into the poorly defendable remains of Frostone.  So put a Dammage Shield on your new friend who just dropped in, Buff yourself, and get ready for the fight of your life. <br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>

<u>Quest Armor</u><br>
In the Ice Clad Ocean there is a small band of Gnolls near the Tower of Frozen Shadows.  Find the NPC Gnoll named Ergrez Shortpaw and hail him.  Then ask Ergrez Shortpaw "What Armor?" and he will then proceed to tell you about how he makes armor for his clan, and he will mention that he can make you armor if you will do him a favor.  So then you say "What favor?"  Ergrez Shortpaw will tell you something about his clan needing help and how he will make you armor if you bing him wolves or cougar skins.  So ask him "What skin?"  And then tell him the skin that you have.  For example to get this mask you would tell him "I have high quality cougar skin."  Ergrez Shortpaw will growl and complain saying something about cougar skin smelling bad, and demands that you bring him 2 mammoth meats.  So give Ergrez Shortpaw the skin and two mammoths meats (don't stack them) and you will earn the Cougarskin Mask.<p>
