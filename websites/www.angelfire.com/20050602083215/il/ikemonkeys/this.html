<center><font size=+2>This Is the Title of This Story, Which Is Also Found 
Several Times in the Story Itself</font><br><font size=+1>Anne Paulsen</font></center>
<hr width=75%><p>    
     This is the first sentence of this story.  This is  the second  sentence.
This is the
     title of this story, which is also found several times in the story itself.
  This
     sentence is  questioning  the  intrinsic  value of the first two sentences.
  This
     sentence is to inform you, in case you haven't already  realized it, that this is a
     self-referential story, that is, a story containing sentences that  refer
to  their
     own  structure  and  function.  This is a sentence that provides an ending
to the first
     paragraph.<p>

     This is the first sentence of  a  new  paragraph  in  a self-referential st
ory.  This
     sentence is introducing you to the protagonist of the story, a young boy na
med Billy.
     This sentence  is  telling  you that Billy is blond and blue-eyed and American and
     twelve years old and strangling his mother. This  sentence  comments  on the awkward
     nature of the self-referential narrative form while recognizing the strange
 and playful
      detachment it affords the writer.  As if illustrating the point made by the last
     sentence, this sentence  reminds us, with no trace of facetiousness, that children are
     a precious gift from God and that the world is a better  place when  graced
  by  the
     unique joys and delights they bring to it.<p>

     This sentence describes Billy's mother's  bulging  eyes and  protruding tongue and
     makes reference to the unpleasant choking and gagging  noises  she's  making.   This
     sentence makes the observation that these are uncertain and difficult times, and that
     relationships,  even  seemingly  deep-rooted and permanent ones, do have a
tendency to
     break down.<p>

     Introduces, in this paragraph, the device  of  sentence fragments.   A  sentence
     fragment.   Another.  Good device. Will be used more later.<p>

     This is actually the last sentence of the story but has been  placed  here
 by
     mistake.   This is the title of this story, which is  also  found  several
 times  in
     the  story itself.   As  Gregor  Samsa  awoke  one  morning from uneasy dreams he found
      himself  in  his  bed  transformed  into  a gigantic insect.  This sentence informs
     you that the preceding sentence is from another story entirely (a  much  better one,
     it must be noted) and has no place at all in this particular narrative.  Despite
     claims of  the  preceding  sentence,  this sentence feels compelled to inform you that
     the story you are reading is in actuality "The Metamorphosis" by Franz  Kafka,  and
     that  the  sentence  referred  to by the preceding sentence is the only sentence  which
      does  indeed belong in this story.  This sentence overrides the preceding
sentence by
     informing the  reader  (poor,  confused  wretch) that this piece of literature is
     actually the Declaration of Independence, but that the author,  in  a  show
  of  extreme negligence (if not malicious
sabotage), has so far failed to include even one single sentence from that  stirring
document, although  he has condescended to use a small sentence fragment, namely, "When in
the  course  of  human events", embedded in  quotation  marks  near  the end of
a sentence.
Showing a keen awareness of the boredom and  downright  hostility  of  the  average reader
with regard to the pointless conceptual games indulged in  by  the  preceding  sentences,
this  sentence  returns  us  at  last to the scenario of the story by asking the
 question,
"Why is Billy  strangling  his mother?"  This  sentence  attempts to shed some light on the
question posed by the preceding sentence  but  fails.  This sentence,  however,
succeeds, in
that it suggests a possible incestuous relationship between Billy  and  his  mot
her  and
alludes to the concomitant Freudian complications any astute reader will immediately
envision.  Incest.  The unspeakable taboo.   The universal prohibition.  Incest.
  And notice
the sentence fragments?  Good literary  device.   Will  be  used more later.<p>

     This is the first sentence in a new paragraph.  This is the last sentence in a new
     paragraph.<p>

     This sentence  can serve as either the beginning of the paragraph  or  end,
 depending
     on its placement.  This is the title of this story, which is also found  several  times
      in the  story itself.  This sentence raises a serious objection to the  entire  class
     of  self-referential  sentences  that merely comment on their own function
or placement
     within the story e.g., the preceding four sentences),  on  the  grounds that  they  are
     monotonously predictable, unforgivably self-indulgent, and merely serve to
distract the
     reader from  the real  subject  of  this  story, which at this point seems
to concern
     strangulation and incest and who  knows  what  other delightful topics.  The purpose of
     this sentence is to point out that the preceding sentence, while not itself
  a  member
     of  the  class  of self-referential sentences it objects to, nevertheless also serves
     merely to distract the reader  from the real subject of this story, which actually
     concerns Gregor Samsa's  inexplicable  transformation  into  a  gigantic insect
     (despite the vociferous counterclaims of other well-meaning although misinf
ormed
     sentences).  This sentence  can serve  as  either  the  beginning  of  the
paragraph or
     end, depending on its placement.<p>

     This is the title of this story, which  is  also  found several times in the story
     itself.  This is almost the title of the story, which is found only once in
 the story
     itself. This  sentence  regretfully states that up to this point the self-referential
     mode of  narrative  has  had  a  paralyzing effect  on  the  actual progress of the
     story itself -- that is, these sentences have been so  concerned  with  analyzing
     themselves and their role in the story that they have failed by and large to perform
     their function as  communicators  of events  and ideas that one hopes coalesce into a
     plot, character development, etc. -- in short, the very raisons d'etre ofany
     respectable, hardworking sentence in the midst of a piece of compelling prose fiction.
     This sentence  in  addition  points  out  the obvious analogy between the plight of
     these  agonizingly  self-aware   sentences   and   similarly afflicted  human  beings,
     and  it  points out the analogous paralyzing effects wrought by excessive and  tortured
      self-examination.<p>

     The purpose of this sentence (which can also serve as a paragraph)  is  to
 speculate
     that  if  the  Declaration of Independence had been worded and structured
as
     lackadaisically  and  incoherently  as  this  story  has  been so far, there's no
     telling what kind  of  warped  libertine  society we'd  be  living  in  now
 or to what
     depths of decadence the inhabitants of this country might have  sunk,  even
  to  the
point  of deranged and debased writers constructing irritatingly cumbersome and
needlessly
prolix sentences that  sometimes  possess the questionable if not downright undesirable
quality of referring to themselves and they  sometimes  even become  run-on  sentences or
exhibit other signs of inexcusably sloppy grammar like unneeded  superfluous  redundancies
that  almost  certainly  would have insidious effects on the lifestyle and morals of our
impressionable  youth,  leading them  to  commit  incest or even murder and maybe that's why
Billy is strangling his mother, because  of  sentences just like this one , which have no
discernible goals or perspicuous purpose and just end up anywhere, even in mid<p>

     Bizarre.   A  sentence  fragment.   Another   fragment. Twelve  years  old.
   This  is
     a sentence that.  Fragmented. And strangling his mother.  Sorry, sorry.   B
izarre.
     This. More  fragments.  This is it.  Fragments.  The title of this story, w
hich.
     Blond.  Sorry, sorry.  Fragment  after  fragment.   Harder.   This is a sen
tence that.
     Fragments.  Damn good device.<p>

     The purpose of this sentence is threefold: (1) to  apologize  for the unfor
tunate and
     inexplicable lapse exhibited by the preceding paragraph; (2) to assure you,
  the
     reader, that  it  will  not  happen  again; and (3) to reiterate the point
that these
     are uncertain and difficult times and  that aspects of language, even seemingly stable
     and deeply rooted ones such as syntax and meaning, do break down.   This  s
entence  adds  nothing  substantial  to  the sentiments of the preceding sentence
but merely
provides a concluding sentence to this paragraph, which otherwise might not have
 one.<p>

     This sentence, in a  sudden  and  courageous  burst  of altruism,  tries  to  abandon
     the self-referential mode but fails.  This sentence tries again, but the at
tempt is
     doomed from the start.<p>

     This sentence, in a last-ditch attempt to  infuse  some iota  of story line
 into this
     paralyzed prose piece, quickly alludes to Billy's frantic cover-up attempts, followed
     by  a lyrical,  touching,  and beautifully written passage wherein Billy is
 reconciled
     with his father (thus resolving the subliminal Freudian conflicts obvious to any astute
     reader) and a final exciting police chase scene during  which  Billy  is accidentally
     shot  and killed by a panicky rookie policeman who is coincidentally named
Billy.  This
     sentence,  although basically  in complete sympathy with the laudable efforts of the
     preceding action-packed  sentence,  reminds  the  reader that  such  allusi
ons  to a
     story that doesn't, in fact, yet
exist are no substitute for the  real  thing  and  therefore will  not  get the
author
(indolent goof-off that he is) off the proverbial hook.<p>

     Paragraph.  Paragraph.  Paragraph.   Paragraph.   Paragraph.    Paragraph.
<p>
     Paragraph.  Paragraph.   Paragraph. Paragraph.  Paragraphh.  Paragraph.  Pa
ragraph.<p>
     Paragraph.<p>

     The purpose.  Of this paragraph.  Is to apologize.  For its gratuitous use.
  Of.
     Sentence fragments.  Sorry.<p>

     The purpose of this sentence is to  apologize  for  the pointless  and  silly
     adolescent  games  indulged in by the preceding two paragraphs, and to express regret
     on the  part of  us,  the  more mature sentences, that the entire tone of this story is
     such that it can't seem to communicate a  simple, albeit sordid, scenario.<p>

     This sentence wishes to apologize for all the  needless apologies  found  in  this
     story (this one included), which, although placed here ostensibly for the benefit of
     the  more vexed  readers,  merely delay in a maddeningly recursive way the
continuation
     of the by-now nearly forgotten story line.<p>

     This sentence is bursting at the punctuation marks with news of the dire import of
     self-reference as applied to sentences, a practice  that  could  prove  to
 be  a
     veritable Pandora's  box  of  potential  havoc,  for if a sentence can refer or allude
     to  itself,  why  not  a  lowly  subordinate clause,   perhaps  this very
clause?   Or
     this  sentence fragment?  Or three words?  Two words?  One?<p>

     Perhaps it is appropriate that this sentence gently and with  no  trace  of

     condescension reminds us that these are indeed difficult and uncertain times  and  that
      in  general people  just  aren't  nice enough to each other, and perhaps we, whether
     sentient human  beings  or  sentient  sentences, should just try harder.  I
 mean, there
     is such a thing as free will, there has to be, and this sentence  is  proof
  of
it!   Neither  this  sentence  nor  you, the reader, is completely helpless in the face of
all the pitiless  forces  at work  in  the  universe.   We  should stand our ground, face
facts, take Mother Nature by the throat and just try harder. By the throat.  Har
der.Harder, harder.<p>

     Sorry.<p>

     This is the title of this story, which  is  also  found several times in th
e story
     itself.<p>

     This is the last sentence of the story.   This  is  the last  sentence  of
 the story.
     This is the last sentence of the story.  This is.<p>

     Sorry.
