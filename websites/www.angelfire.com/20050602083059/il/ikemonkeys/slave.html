<hr width=75%><p>
	She hadn't meant to make the bed that evening, Athena told herself,
nervously flattening the sheets, listening closely for the approach of a
car engine that she knew would be pulling into the driveway at any moment.
She pulled the sheets up hastily, racking her brain to remember Tuli's
exact style of bed making.  Tight hospital corners, she muttered to
herself, pulling the blankets stiffly over the sheets.  With a careful
precision any chambermaid would have envied, Athena lay the pillows on the
bed and hurriedly rushed downstairs.  She threw herself into her chair,
grabbing the remote control as she fell.  She fumbled with it for a moment,
straining to find the power button as she heard the car door slam outside.
The screen door creaked open and the television sprang to live, filling the
room with screams and gunfire.  Athena relaxed.
       <p>	Tuli calmly entered the room, each hairy arm barely supporting a paper bag
overflowing with food products.  "Hi, honey," he said calmly.
<p>	Athena turned her head to him, trying as hard as she could to pretend she
hadn't noticed his arrival.  "Oh!  Hi, sweetie.  Did you get everything you
needed at the store?"
   <p>	Tuli nodded.  "I've got to go put some of this in the freezer before it
melts.  Casserole all right with you for dinner?"
      <p>	"Whatever's easiest for you."  She smiled.  Winningly, she hoped.  Tuli
laughed, confidently.  Athena scrutinized the narrow wrinkles which lined
the corners of his mouth and eyes, attempting to ferret out any possible
suspicion that might be residing there.  Seeing none, she relaxed, turned
back to the television, and ask Tuli for a beer, which he readily brought.
      <p>	Athena sat for a while, rubbing the edges of her lips with the mouth of
the bottle, staring blankly at the television.  She turned over the events
of the past few minutes, attempting in vain to give them some reality, but,
much to her dismay, they held no more emotional content for her than the
endless parade of random violence which floated across the screen before
her.
      <p>	After her usual drive home, she had stepped through the door of her house
and, much to her surprise, nothing happened.  Athena paused in the doorway,
waiting for the inevitable mishap to occur, but, as she stood there, she
realized no such event was to occur.  Tuli, as per a clearly defined clause
in their pre-nuptial agreement, had been designated as the housekeeper,
chef, and, in the case of conception, child-rearer.  Unfortunately for the
two of them, neither was fully aware at the time of Tuli's complete and
utter inability to prepare food with any skill, and, furthermore, to
prepare food without incident.  Every dish was not only inedible, but an
adventure in the preparation.  Tuesday's souffle had not collapsed, as most
inexpertly made souffles are prone to do, but continued to expand until
stretched well beyond the elasticity point of egg until the oven and,
indeed, much of the kitchen and Tuli, were covered with a fine layering of
egg white.  Wednesday's meatloaf had been catapulted by forces beyond
mortal comprehension from the oven, nearly reducing the skull of their pet
cat to a red smudge on the wall.
     <p>	To complicate matters, Tuli remained utterly oblivious to his culinary
ineptitude.  He calmly scraped the edible residue off whatever surfaces he
could reach and was pleased to serve these, housed in fine silver and
china, to his loving bride.  For the first few months, Athena begged him to
either let her cook, which would have been in violation of their contract,
and, therefore, illegal, or to attempt simpler dishes.  Tuli failed to
understand why any change was necessary, and, soon, Athena realized the
futility of her arguments and settled into complacency.
	<p>To his credit, Tuli was an expert, nearly superhuman, housekeeper in other
regards.  Athena arrived home each day from her job at the local college to
find every room in the house, with the exception of the kitchen, spotless.
Cat hairs were disposed of nearly before they touched the surface of the
carpet.  To the best of her recollection, she had yet to see a speck of
dust on any piece of furniture, though she had yet to check the top sills
of the windows.  Tuli had once told Athena, while they were dating, that he
had been raised  in an ancient hotel in Rhode Island by his aunt who had,
to save on costs, forced him into indenture as a chambermaid, or, rather,
chamberlad.  Though most children would have despised such labor, Tuli
found the housework very enjoyable, leading to his insistence on the
housework clause in their agreement.
     <p>	By the night of their honeymoon, Athena realized the depths to which
Tuli's cleaning obsession went.  After their prolonged moment of passionate
lovemaking, Tuli had felt a need, not only to shower, but to procure, from
the rather edgy hotel night staff, a clean set of sheets in which the two
of them could sleep.  Though slightly disgruntled at first, Athena came to
realize the benefits of the situation.  As a child, she had been described
as brainy, and, for the most part, attempted to live up to the epithet.
She had gained her first doctoral degree by her twentieth birthday and was
quickly embraced into the arms of Knibbs College, a small liberal arts
school in scenic San Guinefort.  Her professorial duties not only occupied
all of her time at work, but often left her easily distracted during the
evening, making ordinary domestic tasks an especial burden for her.  Her
female coworkers often complained of the unremitting sexual demands their
husbands put upon them, and Athena regarded herself as fortunate to have as
sexless a partner as Tuli.  Sex simply wasn't clean enough for him, Athena
often pondered.  She had no complaints, however, finding more pleasure with
her hands than she had during the few instances of coupling that had
occurred in their marriage.
	<p>It was Tuli's obsessiveness in regard to cleanliness that had forced her
to frantically make the bed that afternoon.  Finding that the house was
empty, Tuli, according to his note, having run to the store for a moment,
Athena headed upstairs to change out of her rather overstarched business
suit.  After shrugging off the stiff red jacket, she bent down to remove
her shoes, and, doing so, lost her balance and tumbled backwards, colliding
harshly with the bed and falling to the floor amid a jumble of sheets,
comforters, and bedspreads.  Eventually Athena, with much flailing, managed
to retrieve herself from the tangle of linens and stood, one-shoed,
observing the damage.  The mattress lay askew, resting only marginally on
the box spring.  The mattress itself was, for the most part, bare, covered
only by a rather worn-out mattress pad.  Athena, steadying herself on the
bedside table, removed her one shoe and started to heave the queen-sized
mattress back onto the box spring.  After a few vain attempts to shove the
mattress into place, she realized pulling would likely be more effective
and maneuvered around the linens to the opposite side of the bed, whereupon
she reached for the mattress, dragging it toward her.  As the mattress
lifted slightly above the frame, Athena noticed a patch of light white
among the powder blue surface of the box spring and, ceasing momentarily
her efforts in mattress relocation, crouched to examine it.
<p>	The white turned out to be a pile of papers which Athena lifted in hr
right hand and began to peruse.  The first was a bill of sale,  a generic
one that could be purchased at an office supply store.  The writing on it
was Tuli's, easy to identify by his compulsively neat handwriting.  The
bill read simply: (1) Wt. Fm., then, in the price column, the figure
$20,000.  Wt. Fm., she wondered, casually gripping the bill in her left
hand.  Unable to determine what the cryptic writing could possibly stand
for, she leafed through the remainder of the papers.  Each paper was filled
with Tuli's notes.  In addition to being perfectly legible, Tuli's
handwriting was also distinguished by its disregard for margins.  Like most
of his papers, these were filled from top to bottom with line after line of
incredibly small, perfectly legible print.  Athena strained her eyes to
read the tiny notes and realized, with some mental labor, that they were
notes on cooking, much as she had taken during her Home Economics classes
in high school.  Utterly and completely confused, she let her eyes drift
across the room, hoping irrationally that something would provide a
catalyst to make these papers make sense.  Her eyes rested on the small
digital clock quietly perched on Tuli's bedstand and, with a shock,
realized that she had been in the room for nearly twenty minutes and that
Tuli would be home any minute.  She frantically realized that these papers
must have been hidden, and, furthermore, they must have been hidden from
her.  Athena had never been scared of Tuli, but, for some reason, felt a
deep sense of dread within her.  Athena felt her palms sweat and her pulse
quicken, laughingly thinking back to her days as a Psych major and
listening to the town Skinnerite lecturing on flight/fight reactions.  I
need time to think, she mumbled, as she often did when nervous.  Then,
coming to the conclusion, that, whatever Tuli's motivations in hiding the
papers, it would be best for him not to know that she knew of their
existence.  She grabbed the mattress and pulled.
   <p>	"Casserole's ready," Tuli shouted, staggering out of the kitchen's
swinging door, proudly bearing his ceramic dish emblazoned with bold
patterns of fish and sparrows.  Slim trails of smoke seeped out of the
entryway to the kitchen before the door swung shut behind him, cutting off
the smoke.  Tuli brought the steaming dish to the small table occupying the
center of the room and gingerly placed the dish upon the coaster. Tuli
placed himself on the plastic-coated recliner near the table, then reached
over, brandishing two serving utensils, and lunged toward the serving dish.
Within moments he had produced an amorphous quantity of yellowish gelatin.
Looking closely, Athena fancied she saw hints of mushroom, and possibly a
few stray leaves of spinach, suspended in the semi-liquid solution Tuli was
eagerly piling on to her plate.  What kind of cooking school is teaching
him this?
      <p>	Tuli grinned.  "Looks good, doesn't it?"
      <p>	Athena smiled.  Was he deranged?  Did he really think this slop was
appetizing?  She thought back over the recent meals Tuli had served.  Until
this past month, his meals, though presented in unorthodox manners and
often charred, almost tasted like food.  But, from the start of September,
Tuli had begun, with the now-infamous Fruitcake flamb=E9, preparing dishes
utterly beyond the comprehension of even the most creative chef.  Athena
strained to recall the dates occasionally entered in the notes.  She seemed
to recall that all the dates began with September, but, she thought, she
was prone to wishful thinking.
  <p>	The quiet, repetitive noise of Tuli's insistent chewing of the rubbery
food droned in Athena's ears.  She raised her head to see her husband,
grinning like a dog who has brought his master a dead rabbit.  She scowled
at him for a moment, then smiled.
     <p>	She looked down at the plate and watched her meal wobble unappetizingly
before her.  She rose abruptly and moved towards the kitchen.  Tuli started
to stop her, but before he could rise from his chair, Athena stopped him
with a gentle wave of her hand.  "I need something to drink."
	<p>She entered the kitchen to find it, as usual, in a state of total
disarray.  Filthy pots and pans covered every visible inch of the
countertops, as well as spilling into the sink.  She leaned over one of the
pots, peering over the lip to find some sort of green mildew clinging to
the walls, Teflon coating be damned.  Scanning the kitchen, she realized
the key element of Tuli's cooking environment was missing.  In all the
clutter of the pots and pan and utensils, there was not one cookbook.
Athena knew Tuli could not be so creative as to make his own dishes from
scratch, and, as she mindlessly reached for a glass and filled it with
water, she dug deep within her for memories she had long since forgotten.
The horrors of her Home Economics classes as they forced her to recite
mundane recipes for pancakes, meatloaves, and omelets so that she could
prepare anything without the aid of a cookbook.  She turned in horror to
the door leading to the living room and knew, with utter certainty, that
Tuli was taking cooking classes.
<hr width=75%>
	The next day at work was torture for Athena.  Her morning classes were
unruly, an odd occurrence for Athena, whose reputation for speaking faster
than one could write was legendary within the Knibbs halls.  She found
herself slipping into long verbal pauses, as a casual lecture comment would
set her mind working furiously on some tangent or another.  "The fugue
disorder is known to cause a person to act for days without any knowledge
or memory of what they are doing," she rapidly intoned, then stopped
suddenly, thinking maniacally that Tuli might, in a fugue, attend cooking
classes, then return home, hide the evidence and continue with his daily
life.  The scratching of pencils ceased as the class caught up with her and
the abrupt silence brought her back to the classroom and the eager faces,
turned towards each other, whispering and groping each other.  Athena
reached for her forehead and left the room.
    <p>	Once safely back in her office, she poured herself another cup of coffee
and, locking the door of her office, sat at her desk.  She sipped the
coffee, then, with a resoluteness of action that surprised her, reached for
the phone and called her home.  Tuli answered on the second ring.
       <p>	"Sanders residence," chirped Tuli's voice over the fiber optic line.
     <p>	She jumped, having expected him not to be there.  "Hi, honey.  I was just
calling to see if I had left one of my folders on the living room couch."
      <p>	"You'd lose your head if it wasn't attached.  Let me go see if it slipped
under the cushions."
     <p>	Athena was taken aback by the tone of his voice as he said this.  He
sounded mad at me.  To be sure, his voice was sweet, sickeningly so, but
Athena slowly became convinced that underneath was a genuine hostility as
though he were mad at her for her absentminded ways.  She heard the
tell-tale rustle of the phone being lifted from the counter and attempted
to compose her voice.
	<p>"Nope.  The couch is empty."
  <p>	"Oh," she laughed lightly.  "It must be in my briefcase somewhere.  Oh,
well.  I'll see you tonight."
     <p>	"Okay. Bye-bye."
       <p>	Before she could respond, the connection clicked off in her ear.  Athena
slowly lay the phone on its cradle.  Why was he so willing to get rid of
me?  Heading off to class?
<p>	Athena paused.  She looked at the phone, suspiciously, then out the
windows of her office, to make sure she wasn't being watched.  She waited
another half-minute, then scooped up the receiver and dialed her home
again.  No answer.  She hung up and tried again, and, again, found her
house to be devoid of life.
   <p>	She clumsily dropped the receiver into the cradle and watched as it
bounced out and hung, dangling, by its cord, then lifted her purse from the
desk and headed out toward the parking lot.
<hr width=75%>
	With the lack of rush hour traffic, it took Athena a mere ten minutes to
get home.  The driveway was empty, the space that Tuli's car so often
occupied clearly marked, as the ground beneath had been sheltered during
the morning lawn watering and was a different color than the remainder of
the driveway.  The light spot seemed to mock Athena, and, in her anger, she
covered it with her car, that no one else could see it.
    <p>	She hurriedly unlocked the door, feeling like a cat burglar.  Finding the
key, she slowly opened the door and called out for Tuli.  Hearing only the
muffled meowing of the cat in the distance, she opened the door fully and
entered.  She dashed upstairs, taking the steps two at a time, until she
reached her bedroom.  Carefully sliding her hand between the mattress and
the bedspring, she groped blindly for the notes, and, to her dismay, felt
only a single piece of paper, which she retrieved.
       <p>	It was the bill of sale.  She looked at it again, hoping to find some clue
as to what it could possibly be for.  Realizing that no further information
would be gained from the=20slip of paper, she returned it to its hiding
place.  She smoothed the sheets and headed back to her car.
       <p>	Once on the freeway, she flicked on the radio and allowed herself to do
some thinking.  What could Wt. Fm. stand for?  Weight Formula?  Was Tuli
the inventor of something?  Some formula for reducing weight?  She tried
this idea for a while.  Tuli had been an biology major in college, but had
shown no interest in the subject for years.  Unless he had been doing
research in his spare time.
    <p>	She took the next left and headed toward the San Guinefort library.  She
and Tuli shared a card, as neither wanted to deal with the Los Angeles
county bureaucratic system more than necessary.  Finding a parking spot
within a block of the library, a brown stucco building that resembled a
bunker, she entered and slid into the assistance line.
       <p>	After a lengthy wait, Athena found herself confronting an elderly black
woman of impressively large bulk.  The woman's voice, deep and
intimidating, directed itself towards Athena. "May I help you?"
      <p>	Athena paused for a moment, fearing this mountainous woman would easily
see through the flimsy ploy Athena had devised in line, but, seeing no way
to gracefully escape this woman's attention, proceeded with as much
conviction and sweetness as she could muster.  "Um...yes.  My purse was
stolen from me about a month ago, and I just realized my library card was
in it and I wanted to know if any books had been withdrawn on my card?"
    <p>	The woman stared at her, disbelieving.  "You think a purse snatcher is
going to take out books on your library card?"
       <p>	"Yes, well, it was over at the college, and they have a devil of a time
getting cards, since they're not full-time residents, so I thought..."
   <p>	The woman snorted.  "OK.  I'll check your records.  Your name, please."
      <p>	Athena told her and the woman entered the information into her terminal.
After a few beeps and whirrs, the computer rested in silence.  The woman
read the data off the screen.  "How to Cook Golden Turkeys, How to Make the
Perfect Souffle, White Slavery in America, ..."
 <p>	Athena interrupted.  "White Slavery in America?"
    <p>	"Yes, ma'am.  It was taken out nearly a month ago.  You don't remember
taking that one out?"
       <p>	Athena laughed lightly, hoping to sound as ditzy as possible.  "Oh.  Yes.
Yes, I do.  Fine book.  I recommend it highly.  Thank you very much for the
help."
    <p>	Dazed, she walked out of the building and back towards her car.  What on
earth would Tuli want with a book on white slavery?  How could that help
him research weight loss medicine?  Unless that's not what he was doing.
Wt. Fm.  Whitening Formula?  Toothpaste?  It didn't seem likely.  And why
would he sell it for $20,000 without telling her?  White Femurs?  Exporting
black market body parts for racially exclusive types?  No, that didn't
work.  White Female?  Selling people as meat?  For medical research?  For
slaves?
    <p>	She stopped just as she had inserted the keys into the door, as this idea
seized her.  Have to admit it makes sense, she murmured, then unlocked the
door and entered the car.  She sat in the front seat, seatbelt across her
attempting to make some sense of the conclusion she'd reached.  It does
explain the book and the bill.  But why on Earth would Tuli enter the white
slave market?  He doesn't need money;  I take care of him.
      <p>	She turned the key in the ignition, and slowly crept toward the
convenience store around the block.  She parallel parked and went in to
purchase a pack of cigarettes.  She stood outside the doorway of the store,
lighting up for the first time since her marriage.  She shook the ash from
the tip of the cigarette, spilling burnt carbon residue on the sidewalk.
Where did Tuli get the slave?  He couldn't have kept her in the house.
Unless he hasn't yet delivered the goods.  Maybe he got paid in advance.
What the Hell did he do with the money?
      <p>	She dropped the cigarette on the ground, stamping it out, then reentered
her car.  Lacking a better place to go, she drove toward her house, curious
to see whether the driveway was still vacant.  Does thecooking school have
anything to do with it?  Is that what he did with the money?  Of course,
idiot.  Why else would he hide both of those papers together?  Your husband
entered the white slavery market so he could become a better cook!
 <p>	Athena slammed on the brakes of the car, fishtailing into a 90-degree turn
in the middle of the sleepy suburban street on which she was driving.  "Are
you insane?" she shouted to herself.  "Do you honestly think Tuli is white
slaving to pay for cooking school?  You've lived with the man for seven
years, for Chrissakes!"
    <p>	She was interrupted by an abrupt honking, compelling her to look out the
window to see a line of traffic on either side of her car.  Smiling, she
straightened her car and drove off the street, still approaching her house.
       <p>	"You're not going to be satisfied until you confront him, are you?" she
asked herself, not really expecting an answer, but driving, still, toward
her home.
  <p>	As she rounded the corner nearest their house, Athena peered into their
driveway, and, much to her surprise, found two cars filling the driveway.
One, the powder blue Taurus, was familiar to her, as it was Tuli's car.
The other, a black Mercedes with tinted windows and sporting international
plates, was unfamiliar to her and clearly not the car of one of Tuli's
housewife friends.  She coasted past her house, settling into a spot around
the corner.  Once again, feeling like David Niven, she crept stealthily
down the street, skulking into her neighbor's back yard and over the fence
into her own well-shaded lawn.  She slunk toward the kitchen window and
pulled herself up so that she could see in.
     <p>	Tuli was standing, apron on, talking calmly with a short, balding,
well-dressed man of Eastern European descent.  Two very large men in dark
suits and sunglasses, veritable slabs of muscle, stood behind the man, arms
clasped tightly to their chests.  Much to Athena's surprise, Tuli reached
into the oven and produced, without a single error in his ways, a perfectly
baked pan of cookies, which he dexterously flipped into the air with a
spatula.  Athena, trusting in the noise made by Tuli's display, pried open
the window slightly in order to hear the conversation.
    <p>	Tuli flipped a cookie into the air, which was caught by the balding man.
He put it to his mouth and tasted.  "Wonderful, Mr. Sanders," he exclaimed,
spewing a fine dust of cookie crumbs as he did so.
   <p>	Tuli moued.  He offered the plate to the two dark men, but their
expressions failed to reflect any desire for baked goods and Tuli withdrew
the pan.  The balding man spoke, sharply.  "Now, if we can get down to
business, Mr. Sanders.  I understand my property will be available today at
six."
      <p>	Tuli seated himself at the kitchen table.  "Yes.  Six o clock at the
designated spot.  Should be an easy transfer."
   <p>	The balding man nodded.  "Good.  Then we need not meet again.  I leave the
country tonight with my new acquisition."
      <p>	He turned towards his bodyguards, and Athena, in a flash of intuition,
realized that, if she did not leave, she would be discovered, and, though
not entirely sure of what was occuring, she realized that discovery might
lead to unpleasant consequences.  She released the windowsill and dashed
back to her car, trying to create as little disturbance as possible.
    <p>	Once back in her car, she looked at her watch.  The small digital display
cheerfully flashed that it was exactly five in the afternoon.  How would
Tuli get the girl to them in only an hour?  Did he have her hidden
somewhere?  Unless she was supposed to meet at the rendezvous at six?  But
that was impossible.  Six was exactly when she got home from work.
       <p>	Athena laughed, partly at her own stupidity, partly in a vain attempt to
leaven the situation.  Is he selling me?  Would Tuli sell his own wife?
She thought back to various occasions that might have annoyed Tuli enough
to provoke his attempt to sell her, but nothing sprang to mind.  She had
been faithful to him.  She had never criticized his cooking.  She'd
supported him for years.
      <p>	Then she remembered the rage suppressed in Tuli's voice as he chided her
playfully for forgetting her folder.  Is he selling me because I'm not neat
enough?  The idea was insane.  Tuli may be slightly obsessive, but he would
never go so far as to enslave his wife just for being messy.  Of course,
there is really only one way to find out for sure.
     <p>	Athena stepped out of the car, and slipped the keys in her purse.  She
walked back towards her house, this time following the sidewalk, walking
erect and proud.  She rounded the corner toward her house and could not
help noticing the dark Mercedes lurking down at the end of her street, and
she could not be sure it was not simply her imagination that made it appear
that it was rolling slowly closer to her house as she approached it.
     <p>	She proceeded up the narrow gravel pathway that cut evenly through her
lawn, noticing the perfect placement of each piece of gravel, the product
of endless hours of labor on Tuli's part.  She reached for the doorway,
feeling the cold metal in her hands as she turned the knob of the house she
had shared with a loving husband for years.
     <p>	Stepping inside, she saw Tuli, wearing his apron.  He was cooking, as
usual, though the kitchen was perfectly clean.  The only dishes that were
not in their proper place were heaped with brightly colored food, each
emitting a fine white steam and, with it, an odor that set Athena's mouth
watering.  Tuli smiled at her but said nothing, merely offering her a plate
heaped with turkey, squash, souffle.  She reached for it, drawn by the
bright colors and rich aroma and lifted the turkey to her mouth.
    <p>	She rolled the stringy meat around in her mouth.  The sensual strength of
the rich, salty meat hit her like a brick wall, and she closed her eyes in
ecstasy.  This man loves me.  He is willing to sell an innocent girl into
slavery so that I may eat decent food.  My birthday isn't for another week,
but this must be an early present.  He loves me.  How could I think that
this man who I know better than I know myself could sell me?  He loves me.
What a sacrifice he has made!  I am the luckiest woman in the world.
       <p>	She swallowed the meat, and, recovering from her ecstatic state, attempted
to open her eyes, but found herself unable to do so.  Indeed, she found
herself feeling lightheaded, and, after a few seconds of struggling against
her unwilling eyelids, she found she had lost any desire to see the world
and had, after a moment of epiphany, decided she would rather see black.
She felt the plate taken from her grasp and heard Tuli's reassuring voice
speak to her, comforting her, although it seemed as though it spoke from
across a great distance, "Good bye, dear.  I'm sure your new owner won't
mind your messiness."
