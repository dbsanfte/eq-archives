         The Butcherblock Mountains are a huge area in the Northeast of Faydwer.
         This is where newbies from the adjacent Dwarven city of Kaladim
         come to train. Boats depart from here to Antonica and Kunark, if
     	 you have the patience to wait for them. This is a great zone for hunting.
     	 There are generally very few people here, and the zone is so big that
     	 you'll have entire areas to yourself. There are 
     	 monsters of all levels all over the zone. You could stay in this zone for at least 7 levels. 
     	 The mountains divide up the zone into smaller regions, and a lot
     	 of the time you'll have an entire region to yourself. When you're at levels 5 and 6, I would suggest that you group or get
     	 a partner so you can take on higher-level monsters, such as goblins or scarabs. There isn't much
     	 danger here if you're careful. Stay near the guard houses, of which there
     	 are many. Make sure that you /con everything before you attack it,
     	 because some monsters vary in levels. Just about every creature in this
     	 zone will gang up on you if they see you attack another one of their kind, 
     	 so be alert for that. There are 2 main regions to note. One is the true newbie area, 
     	 just in front of Kaladim. There are oodles of low-level monsters here, and the guards are
     	 always close. The other is the Chessboard. Undead Skeletons (level 7+) spawn here, and
     	 make good fodder for a camping group. 
         <p>
         <font size="5">Final Verdict</font><p>
         A great zone for hunting. The small number of players here means that
     	 you'll have a good deal of space for yourself. Grouping or getting a partner
     	 makes it even better.<p>
