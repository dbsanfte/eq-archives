I started life just like everyone else in Neriak. As soon as you're born you're given a job, based on your skills and talents.  Some are chosen to be mages, some are to work in the temple of Innoruuk, other sent to be an apprentice of the Dead. Yet there are a few in Neriak that are trained by the Ebony Brotherhood to be defenders of Nektulos.  I was one of those few.  My agility and dexterity made me a fast and fierce fighting machine.  I was trained in swordplay, archery, and learned to make my own armors out of the skins of the animals I killed.  Life was rough and lonely in Nektulos.  But I survived, I had to, I was a Dark Elf.  Eventually I met up with my birth brother Staelth.  He had chosen the path of the assassin, the backstabbing thief, which in Neriak is a noble profession.  I joined my long lost brother and some other family members, and we formed our own guild* &quot;The Assassins of Nektulos.&quot; We sought to protect our forest from the marauding hoards and to be helpful to our fellow dark races.  But some thing happened, something happened to me.  I was out there, I saw the world for the first time, I saw the sun, I saw the ocean, but most importantly, I saw the people of Norrath.  I traveled the world. I went into cities that were full of people, people who were talking and laughing. But people who were looking at me, looking at me like a murderer* for the first time in my life I saw racism. I soon became aware of my actions; I began to question everything.  As I looked at the world around me - the people I called friends, and the one I called brother, I didn't like what I saw.  I saw I was involved with thieves, I was a murderer.  I confronted my brother about his actions and the people he was involved with, but he was no longer my brother.  He was now a thief.  I needed out, I picked up my things and I left Neriak.  But where to go?  Then I recalled a place I'd been once - a place where the trees reminded me of home and the little people were friendly, even to a Dark Elf like myself.  A place called Misty Thicket, wherein I set out to be a person.  I was never going to be the way I was before, I had changed my ways.  I began the long journey to make this land of ours a better place for one and all.  It's is going to be the new NEVERMOR forevermore.
