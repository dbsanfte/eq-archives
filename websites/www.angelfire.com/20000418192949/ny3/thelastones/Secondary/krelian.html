<font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Name: Krelian<br>
Race: Dark Elf<br>
Class: Necromancer<br>
Deity: Innoruuk<br>
Level: 18 (as of Jan. 3 '00)<br>
<br>
My Life is a rather difficult but rewarding (honest) one, due to my choice of race and
class.<br>
I do have memories of regret, most often brought about by murderous NPC's that I had done
nothing against. Refusal to do buisiness with a 'vile' Necromancer is common thinking
among most merchants of Norrath. My beliefs conflict with theirs, so in acts of
stubborness and willingness to lose a sell they shun you to be eaten by wolves (or
Crocs...).<br>
My home town of Neriak judges me admirably (seriously!), and as such protects me from
opposing forces and offers exceptional deals of trade. Initially, I had difficulties in
defending my city from attackers of any sort, be they human or lowly monster. Now, after
the 18th season in my profession, I can honestly say that this is the only way for one to
adventure... With a Skeleton pet and debilitating spells, I am able to tackle foes of
greater strength alone.<br>
I feel extremely powerful when travelling, and have particular strengths versus Undead
foes, which demonstrate quite frequently. In the Oasis of Marr I have stayed for some six
seasons, gradually becoming more knowledgeable, and powerful, which each slain enemy.<br>
I will continue to make a name for my guild and guild bretheren, a name of honesty,
fairness, and excellence. Only time can tell of the future's path for myself, of each
waking moment I shall strive to grow and better myself, and the world I live in. <br>
<br>
(Yes, I know, sounds like i'm in the wrong class huh... should be Cleric or Paladin... oh
well... Surely there must be some good Necros, nay?)</font></p>
