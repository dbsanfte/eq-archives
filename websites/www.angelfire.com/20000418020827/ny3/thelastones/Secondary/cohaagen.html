I come from the cold lands of Everfrost where the brutes like me are thicker. I spent my time killing stuff, getting loot, drinking, and fishing. Then finally one day I left Everfrost and set off to Qeynos. I then spent much of my time on the Island in Eruds crossing killing wisps, zombies, bats, and snakes. Then I got a guide to Freeport named Lokana. It was an extreme jacked, and action packed adventure.  Then I went to Crush Bone. I was there killing stuff, making money, drinking, and I started fletching but since I could not fit in any buildings there I had to have someone buy me a fletching kit.  But there was not many places to fish around. Then I headed back to Freeport and then Went to the Oasis. Those Spectres and Sand Giants never came close to killing me.  After awhile I went to Highpass Hold.  There were evils orcs that tried to kill me, but I killed dem, I killed dem. I made good money there. Then I went to Highkeep but that place was not so great so now i am in Cazic Thule.  I kill stuff, get loot, and give out the tip of the day now.  I dont do so much drinking or fishing anymore. I use to play the bongos though but I accidentally sat on them while in the Common Lands. If you need advice just ask for todays tip.  This is the first tip ever said, make sure you remember it.  Cohaagens tip, you must have de hot special, it is my number one
recommendation.
