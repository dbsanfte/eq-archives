<b>Race: </B>Half-Elf<br>
<b>Class: </B>Ranger<br>
<b>God: </B>Tunare<br>
<br>
<b>Character Info: </B>This ranger was born in Surefall Glade and hunted in the nearby
Qeynos Hills. When he realized that it was CRAP, he asked a fellow ranger to guide him to
the wonderful little town of Rivervale. <br>
Using his rusty battle axe, he fought off the evil gobbies of RunnyEye, the Deathfist
orcs, and the terrible bixies of well...easiness. He joined his long time friend Bedavard,
and continued to fight with his &quot;wonderful&quot; rusty battle axe. After the
suggestion from Ralfo, his other long time friend, he put the money into a Minotaur battle
axe. This not only frightened the gobbies into pure terror, it also made my friend buy
one...so long for uniqueness. <br>
<br>
I then met up with my true love...Unique. I leveled with her for a while, then I set off
for the dreaded Western Plains of Karanas with Bedavard. Here I realized the true pain of
death. I discovered the bandits, and died. I discovered the giants that reside in the
Karanas, and died. Then I even discovered my dreaded fate of attacking high level NPC's,
and dying...this made up my mind to leave these horrible plains with my friend who also
had bad experiences. <br>
<br>
We made our way all the way to the other side of Antonica and hunted in the Northern
Deserts of Ro. Here I made the sand scarbs fear the wrath of Pubsin. Then I made my way
into the Oasis of Marr. This tedius place filled with grains of sand were very boring. The
challange of killing croc after corc was not fun for the ranger...so he moved to the city
of orcs, Crushbone. He there found his elven brothers, the Wood Elves. I trained in the
ways of magic and destroyed the orcs. <br>
<br>
Then, with the call from his friend, Bedavard, I returned to the Oasis of Marr. Here we
realized the true badfullness of the deserts. So we seperated, and went different ways, I
went to the High Pass Hold and destroyed the gnolls and orcs there. I then met back up
with Bedavard in the Southern Plains of Karanas and killed the aviaks. Then realizing he
was a ranger, he decided to travel the world. Reaching the far plains of Everfrost and the
lower reaches of Guk. <br>
<br>
Traveling to the mountianous terrain in Steamfront to the plain and terriblely boring
Toxxulia forest. Then traveling back to the continent of Faydwer, I batteled the undead in
the poor excuse for an estate, Unrest. Realizing the true horror of this place, I once
again set on the move and went back to the High Pass Hold and into the Keep. Here is my
new spot to hunt the gobbies and usually I travel to new places, and then returning to the
keep, and resting...<br>
