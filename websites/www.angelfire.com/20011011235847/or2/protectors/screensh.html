<TABLE>
<TR><TD>The New Lands of Velious are, for the most part, snow and trees, not very exciting.  However, within the dungeons and in rare places, there are some very exciting and interesting spots.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD><a href="images/vel01.jpg"><img src="images/vel01th.jpg" border=2 Alt="[Icebreaker boat]"></a></TD>
	<TD>Those whacky gnomes came up with a ship to bust through the ice on their way to Velious.  Why they take off from Ro to get to this ship mystifies even the gnomes, but there you go.</TD></TR>
<TR>	
	<TD><a href="images/vel02.jpg"><img src="images/vel02th.jpg" border=2 Alt="[Enraged Chef]"></a></TD>
	<TD>The Enraged Chef, on the second floor of the Tower of Shadows in Velious.  This hideous wench apparently is upset that she has Drolvargs doing all her cooking.</TD></TR>
<TR>
	<TD><a href="images/vel03.jpg"><img src="images/vel03th.jpg" border=2 Alt="[Armored Shadow]"></a></TD>
	<TD>This empty suit of armor is a non undead monster called the Armored Shadow in the Tower of Shadows.  It is reeling from a blow by Moonglum here!</TD></TR>
<TR>
	<TD><a href="images/vel04.jpg"><img src="images/vel04th.jpg" border=2 Alt="[Velium Crawler]"></a></TD>
	<TD>Deep in the Crystal Caverns is this odd beast that looks like a tiny Faydedar.  It apparently is fond of the velium crystals that are all throughout the mines.</TD></TR>
<TR>
	<TD><a href="images/vel05.jpg"><img src="images/vel05th.jpg" border=2 Alt="[Queen Drachnia]"></a></TD>
	<TD>Here we see the Queen Drachnia, queen of the spiders deep under the Crystal Caverns.  She is under asssault, her lot in life to show up and die within seconds.</TD></TR>
<TR>
	<TD><a href="images/velport.jpg"><img src="images/velporth.jpg" border=2 Alt="[Iceclad Portal]"></a></TD>
	<TD>The Port to Velious has a huge, roaring dragon statue over it.  Many dragon statues and themes are in the lands, this one apparently roaring a warning that the porter is rather dangerous to use.</TD></TR>
<TR>
	<TD><a href="images/vel06.jpg"><img src="images/vel06th.jpg" border=2 Alt="[Manticore]"></a></TD>
	<TD>One of the more interesting creatures wandering the snowy wastes of Velious is this Manticore.  Uncommon and considerably more dangerous than they appear, these are dangerous brutes</TD></TR>

<TR><TD colspan="3">The Warrens are open on the Test Server, and one of our people is over there getting information and pics to bring to us.  They are presently only accesible through the Paineel newbie area (off the room that leads 
to the watery entrance to the Hole).  The Warrens is a sort of Kobold Crushbone/Blackburrow, full of the furry creatures, bats, and other small things.  It is roughly level 5-30, and drops a variety of new lower level items and 
new things.  Most of the benefit of this dungeon so far appears to be good experience for the level, some place fun and new to go, and faction with both Paineel and Erudia.  The items are unique looking, and sell for pretty 
good money although they aren't anything you'd twink a character with.  Here are a few of the things seen so far.</TD></TR>

	<TD colspan="2">Here we have a view inside the Warrens, one of the large rooms.  The Warrens are very dense with spawns that, like the goblins in Permafrost, will often be so green they let you pass, but if you are being chased 
will swarm on you horribly.</TD>

	<TD>Grimstaff's Rune Bank girl, Ciiereth.  She is wearing Gnomeskin and Tizmak with a little bit of armor from the Warrens for her wrists.  Just looked extra nice and I wanted to have her on here to show off.</TD>
