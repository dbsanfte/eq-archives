<p align="left">To make a long story short. Our guild founder Kadelplexil, returned to EQ
after almost a year of inactivity and logs on one day and begins to demand control of the
guild, well suffice it to say that our members objected strongly, most members had never
even met this person claiming to be the leader of TLO. Well, like a childish little kiddie
with his feelings hurt at rejections, Kadelplexil uses the /guild disband command (as his
original character still had guild leader status in our guild) and disbanded us right then
and there. After much petitioning by members and arguing with GMs, we were informed that
there is nothing that they can do about it, small wonder eh. Being a close knit guild,
built on friendships and bonds, we hike up out bootstraps, pull together (difficult using
all /tells I might add hehehe) and reform the guild as &quot;Unbroken&quot; in testament
to our unbreakable bonds of friendships, loyalty to honor, justice, and unity that is our
guild. HaaaaZaaaaa! Long live the Knights Unbroken until time unending!</p>
