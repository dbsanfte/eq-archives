     Hello and welcome to EverQuest for Newbies! This site is dedicated to the 
     younger inhabitants of Norrath, the newbies. During your newbie (1-10) years,
     you will learn many key concepts that will serve you well throughout
     the game. My goal is to teach you all of those concepts, as well as inform
     you on zones, strategies, equipment, and classes. Unfortunately, this site
     is a work-in-progress, so the only completed sections are the 
     <a href="zones/zones.htm">zone listings</a> and <a href="strats/general.htm">general
     strategies.</a> I will continue to post new information as I finish it. Thank you for visiting!<p>

     I've been going through all the existing pages and updating their general appearance.
     The main item corrected was a code glitch that caused zone pages to look pretty crappy
     when in 1024x768 resolution - everything should look much better now. Now that the little
     things have been corrected, I can return to the important stuff, like creating new class
     strategies.

<b>Sunday, October 8, 2000</B><br>
     After a long hiatus from my duties at EQ for Newbies, due to the demanding pressure of school,
I have finally returned.
     The <a href="strats/magician.htm">Magician Strategies</a>
     section is now up, and I've made some updates to the zones of <a href="zones/lfay.htm">Lesser Faydark</a>, 
<a href="zones/gfay.htm">Greater Faydark</a>, <a href="zones/steamfont.htm">Steamfont</a>, and <a href="zones/lfay.htm">Qeynos Hills</a>, 
as well as <a href="strats/warrior.htm">Warrior</a> strategies.<p><b>-Asfolath</B>

<b>Thursday, August 26, 2000</B><br>
     I continue to make slow but steady progress on the Class Guides.
     The <a href="strats/cleric.htm">Cleric Strategies</a>
     section is now up. <p><b>-Asfolath</B>

     <b>Thursday, August 24, 2000</B><br>
     The <a href="strats/warrior.htm">Warrior Strategies</a>
     section is now up. As usual, more strategies added to the <a href="strats/general.htm">General Strategies</a>
     and <a href="strats/druid.htm">Druid Strategies</a> pages. Finally, I added a
     link to the <a href="links.htm">links</a> page.<p><b>-Asfolath</B>

     <b>Tuesday, August 22, 2000</B><br>
     Today I finished up the <a href="strats/druid.htm">Druid Strategies</a>
     section. Also, more strategies added to the <a href="strats/general.htm">General Strategies</a>
     page.<p>

     <b>Monday, August 21, 2000</B><br>
     Today I put the finishing touches on the <a href="strats/general.htm#lingo">EQ Lingo</a>
     section. I recommend you check this out, as it familiarizes you with almost all of the
     slang used in EQ, and there is a lot of it. I also added a page describing 
     <a href="eqinfo.htm">EQInfo</a>, a cool and informative program. Check it out.<p>

     Today I stuck some more tips up on the <a href="strats/general.htm">
     General Strategies</a> page as well as fixed some links on the
     <a href="links.htm">links</a> page.<p>

    Today I posted the <a href="strats/general.htm">General strategies</a> page. As
    I encounter more tips I will put them up. If you have one you'd like to submit, 
    <a href="mailto:Martian72@aol.com?SUBJECT=EQ for Newbies web site">send it to me</A>
    and if I think it's worthy of being posted, I'll put it up.
