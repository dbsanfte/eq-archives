Growing up under the bright neon lights of Neriak, Alora always wondered what the rest of
the world might look like. Upon reaching her 8th season, she decided she was strong enough
to venture away from the security that was home. <br>
<br>
Along the way Alora encountered prejudice and hatred. These people didn't even know her,
how could they possibly hate her on sight!?!? <br>
<br>
She strove to make every race and class she met accept her. Her main goal was to visit all
the wonderous magical cities she had heard of as a child...from the dark intelligent land
of Erudin to the mechanical Gnome city of Ak'non. Into her 24th season, this goal was
accomplished. <br>
<br>
Like all women, Alora loves fine jewelry, taking it upon herself, she strove to
create only the finest of items. Over time she has proven to be one of the few master
jewelers in Norrath. <br>
<br>
Alora likes to spend her days exploring new and wonderous places, it is not unusual for
her to be seen in Erudin one hour and in Oggok the next. She has traversed the land and
looks forward to venturing to new unexplored continents in the future. /font&gt;<font size="2"></p>
