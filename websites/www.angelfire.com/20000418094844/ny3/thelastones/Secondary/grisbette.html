</font>Grisbette, &quot;Acquisitioner of Fine Things&quot; (or simply<br>
Gris) is in that awkward not-quite-an-adult stage,<br>
since she grew up fending for herself in the<br>
backstreets of Kaladim. Eventually she started her own<br>
business of performing tasks for others.....yeah,<br>
yeah, tasks, that's it. She's fearless and she's<br>
quick, and she's all business when it comes to<br>
carrying out a deal. Usually she is more quick to<br>
bargain if a dwarven&nbsp; ale or two is thrown in with the<br>
deal. It is important to note that there is still<br>
honor among some thieves, for she is loyal to her<br>
friends and her guildmates. She may be young, but<br>
anyone trying to pull a fast one on this streetwise<br>
kid will likely find an uncomfortable jab to his back.<br>
