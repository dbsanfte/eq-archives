<p align="left"><br>
&quot;Medal of Honor&quot; awarded to Knights Belledonna, Darkian, Kallie, and Bombure. On
the dates of Jan 23, &amp; 24th, this party of brave adventurers stood toe to toe with an
evil KSer Wizard Dangt, courageously guarding their camp spot against the invading KSer.
On both of these evenings the vile Dangt train killed our party, not once but twice, and
still these brave knights returned to reclaim not only their bodies, but their rightful
camp spot and to confront the evil Dangt and demand that he cease and desist. The GMs were
petitioned, and on both nights these courageous knights risked life and experience again
in order for the GM to witness such unjust conduct of the evil Dangt. And I am proud to
say that on each night, the GMs acknowledged their right, and sternly issued a warning
against the player record of Dangt. Hail and Well Met brave Knights Belledonna, Darkian,
Kallie and Bombure! For your brave acts you are hereby awarded the TLO &quot;Medal of
Honor&quot;! </p>

<p align="left"><br>
&quot;Defender of Justice&quot; awarded to Knights Belledonna, Darkian, Kallie, Bombure,
Carnus, Galivious, Izlaaru, Klithor, and Goad. On the date of Jan 25th, Izlaaru, Klithor,
and Goad answered the call for protection from a vile KSer Dangt in Beholders Gorge from a
rightful camping party of players Belledonna, Darkian, Kallie, Carnus, and Galivious.
These 3 knights gave of their time selflessly to travel to the gorge, defend the rightful
party, and courageously confronted the vile Dangt to cease and desist, and tactfully
petitioned GMs to please appear and defend the rightful party. Although the party members
were the target of the KSer, they are still to be recognized with the Defender of Justice
award for their courage and determination, and also for their participation and tactfully
petitioning the GM on the behalf of justice. I am proud to say, that justice was indeed
bestowed upon the valiant knights of TLO as the GM Cammii appeared, warned Dangt of his
past transgressions, and then before everyone's eyes to behold, she summarily banned Dangt
from Norath. the GM reiterated that it was not tonight's event of KSing that caused Dangt
to be banned, but his transgressions in the past, and for twice warnings against Train
Killing parties Sunday and Monday nights, and to reiterate that KSing is not a bannable
offence, but Train Killing is. Hail and Well Met brave Knights! For your brave deeds this
night, you are all hereby dubbed &quot;Defenders of Justice&quot;!</p>

<p align="left">&quot;The Knight of Justice&quot; For standing up against an evil player,
valiantly thwarting their vile deeds, or for bravely challenging an evil player to a duel,
win or lose, or for taking action to right a grave wrong in the lands of Norath. Awarded
to recipients who stand up for the cause of Justice, and let evil players know their deeds
are ruining the game for others, and bravely takes action to defend others in the name of
Justice. All hail brave Belladonna for staring down the most vile of evil clerics,
challenging him to a duel, defeating him once, and stubbornly refuses to give ground, even
after the cleric is buffed by a high level player, remains true to her challenge a second
time, and defends justice even unto death! All Hail Belladonna &quot;Knight of
Justice&quot; </p>
