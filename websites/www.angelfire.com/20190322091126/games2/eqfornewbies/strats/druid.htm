     <p>
     
     The Druid is, in my opinion, the coolest class in the game. (Of course, I play a Druid, 
     so I'm a little biased, but that's beside the point.) This is because Druids
     can do it all. In a group, for example, a high-level Druid can buff party members,
     provide backup heals, evac the group, cast DD spells, snare, and even melee a little.
     Druids have a wide variety of spells, and it's important to be familiar with all of them.
     For a very detailed and well-written spell guide, click <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/GuideDruid.htm">

     <p>
     <a name="#1"></a><br>
     <li><b>Rank 1: 1 - 5</b><br>
     
     This is a pretty easy rank. Use it to get used to your spells and what a Druid does.
     Basically, the best way to kill something here is to get its attention with a DD
     and then whack it until it's dead. Grouping doesn't really matter here. One thing
     to do is practice your skills. Whack everything you see to improve your weapon skills
     rating. Buff and heal people walking by to improve your spells rating. Your main
     spells here are Snare, Burst of Flame, Minor Heal, and Skin Like Wood. The last one
     is the first in a long line of Skin Like - buffs. It adds about 15 hp and 4 ac. At lower
     levels, that's a lot. It can save your life, so you should always have it activated.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#2"></a><br>
     <li><b>Rank 2: 5 - 9</b><br>
     Big changes for the Druid here. You get your first of many travel spells, Gate. 
     This spell returns you to your home point, and is therefore very useful when
     you have to return home to buy/sell something and don't want to walk the whole 
     way. You also pick up a powerful new AoE DD, Invoke Lightning, and a conjuration-
     based DD, Whirling Wind. This spell does 25 points of damage, which is enormous
     at levels 5-7, and also helps prepare for level 14, when your conjuration
     skills will be needed for DOTs. More importantly, you pick up <a href="#harmony">
     Harmony</a> and <a href="#root">Grasping Roots</a>, both of which give you great new ways to kill things.
     This is a hard rank to pass, because you seem to require more experience relative
     to your level to level up. Also, you will find yourself low on mana after every battle,
     and it takes a while or you recharge, until you get Meditate at level 8. This is
     like a godsend, and everything gets easier right there. At this rank, you can group
     or go solo, it doesn't matter.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#3"></a><br>
     <li><b>Rank 3: 9 - 14</b><br>
     Another big level for Druids. We get a bunch of cool new buufs, a powerful DD, and a new
     heal. The DD and heal are just upgrades to spells you already have: Burst of Fire and
     Minor Healing. They are both a little more mana-efficient, and are about three times as
     potent as the previous versions, making healing and killing both go faster. We have plenty
     of buffs, and they're all pretty good. Firefist is a melee buff that makes you miss
     less and do more damage to boot. Shield of Thistles is a 6-pt DS, so every time a mob
     hits you, it takes 6 points of damage. This may not seem like a lot, but let's say
     a mob hits you 15 times during a fight. That's 90 points of damage right there, which
     is a little less than half of a mob's HP at level 10. Strength of Earth adds to your
     strength, adding a little punch to your attacks and allowing you to carry more before
     you become encumbered. Treeform is an awesome self-only spell that transforms you...
     into a big tree. Not only is it cool, it has a lot of practical uses. First
     of all, you gain HP quicker while transformed, almost as fast as you gain mana while
     meditating. Second, you can still cast and melee while in Treeform. At this rank, I 
     would suggest grouping, simply because it's more fun and you will need the grouping
     experience for later on in life.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#create"></a><br>
     <li><b>Creating your Druid</b><br>
     The most important attribute for a Druid is Wisdom, plain and simple. This is
     what determines how much mana you have. I suggest you pump all of your bonus points
     into Wisdom - all of the other attributes are just
     secondary and unnecessary. Keep this in mind as you choose your race. The
     four choices are Half Elf, Halfling, Human, and Wood Elf. Human and Half Elves
     are worthless as Druids. They simply don't have enough Wisdom to be any good.
     Halflings and Wood Elves offer the same amount of Wisdom, so choosing between
     them pretty much boils down to starting locations. Wood Elves start at Kelethin
     in the <a href="../zones/gfay.htm">Greater Faydark</a>, one of the most crowded zones in the game. Halflings
     begin in the city of Rivervale, adjacent to <a href="../zones/misty.htm">Misty Thicket</a>.
     As much as I love my home city of Kelethin, I would have to recommmend Halflings.
     Misty Thicket is one of the best newbie zones in the game, if not <b>the</b> best.<p>	
     
     <a name="#harmony"></a><br>
     <li><b>Crowd Control</b><br>
     Harmony is a level 5 Druid spell, and it's easily one of the most powerful weapons
     in our arsenal. Its functioning can be shown with the following example: if there 
     are two Orcs standing close to each other, but you only want to pull one, Harmony
     one and pull the other with a DD spell. If you didn't use Harmony, the other Orc
     would react to the attack on its comrade and come running at you. So basically, the harmonied
     mob has its aggro radius reduced to about 1 yard. This means that if the Orcs are
     too close together, when you try to pull one, they will both run at you. This spell
     allows you to take on camps without having the whole group of mobs running at you,
     so it's obviously a powerful tool. It should be noted that at farther distances from
     the target, you will not see the effect on the mob. This doesn't mean that it was
     not successful, however. There is a very well-written and detailed guide to this spell
     <a href="http://www.eqdruids.com/harmony.htm">here</a>.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#spells"></a><br>
     <li><b>Know your spells</b><br>
     As a Druid, you have a wide variety spells, and it pays to know them all. Know how and when to use
     every one of them. If you do, then you will become about twice as deadly, by yourself
     and with a group.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#root"></a><br>
     <li><b>Root</b><br>
     This spell isn't that important at this point in your EQ career. However, you will
     be using it alot later for kiting, so you may as well get used to it now. Basically, 
     it roots your target in one place for about 20 seconds and does a little damage as 
     well. Once it's stuck, step back a little and nuke it until you're down to about
     1 bubble of mana, then step in and melee. This strategy is mana-expensive, but it allows
     you to get the mob down to about 50% before it even has a chance to hit you.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#solo"></a><br>
     <li><b>Soloing methods</b><br>
     Grouping is fun and adventurous, but sometimes you'll just want to hunt by yourself.
     There are a few things you should keep in mind while soloing: 
     <ol>
     <li><b>Harmony</b><br>
     Whenever there's a camp you want to take, this spell is an invaluable tool. If
     you don't know how to use it, go <a href="#harmony">here</a>. Anyway, using this spell, 
     you can take camps one mob at a time, which allows you to take a whole camp by yourself - 
     giving you a steady stream of loot and XP.
     <li><b>Have a routine planned out</b><br>
     It always helps to have a plan for killing stuff. For example, I used this system to
     kill /con: yellow Sand Scarabs in the Northern Desert of Ro at level 9. First of all, I would root
     the bug. I would then nuke it 2-3 times. Next, I would buff myself with Shield of Thistles, 
     a 6-point DS. With that done, I would run up and start meleeing the bug. It would already
     be damaged from the nukes, and now whenever it hit me, it was pierced for 6 points
     of damage. This is the kind of system you want to have planned, and it's much more
     effecient than simply running up to the mob and whacking it.
     <li><b>Casting between hits</b><br>
     It's pretty difficult, but it can be done. As soon as you see the mob's attack
     animation start, click the spell. Doing this, you an heal yourself during the battle, 
     hit the mob with a DD for some extra damage, or buff yourself. Knowing this skill 
     and being able to pull it off will allow you to survive many close battles.
     
     </ol>
     
     <p>
     <a name="#snare"></a><br>
     <li><b>Snare</b><br>
     Many people will tell you that this is one of the best spells in the game. I do not
     disagree. You get it at level 1, and you should start using it right away. Basically,
     it slows the enemy to half of its normal speed. This has a bunch of uses.
     <ol>
     <li><b>Kiting</b><br>
     You can't really kite as a newbie, but you can do something resembling it. It's pretty
     simple: snare, run, and nuke. You have to be facing the mob to nuke it, however.
     <li><b>Stopping runners</b><br>
     This is probably the best facet of snare. When a mob is low on health, it will start running.
     At lower levels, this isn't a big deal, as you can kill a running mob with a few hits.
     However, at higher levels, mobs will start running earlier in a fight, and it will take a lot longer to kill 
     them. While they're running, there's chance that you'll run right into another mob, and
     then you're screwed. Snaring the mob prevents that.
     <li><b>Running away</b><br>
     If, all of a sudden, you are gripped by the urge to run your ass off and escape
     a mob, you should probably snare it first. The mob will pursue you, hitting you all the
     time, and you probably won't make it back to the guards. If it's snared, however, you
     can outrun it and make it back to safety.

     <li><b>Your role in a group</b><br>
     As previously mentioned, Druids can do it all. And that is precisely what you should do.
     Let the situation dictate what you do in a group. If there are any holes in the group
     (no healer, no buffer, no nuker, etc.) you should fill that role. Have that be your main
     role, and do your various Druid tasks when you aren't called upon to do your primary job. 
     If you're attacking a camp, use 
     <a href="#harmony">Harmony</a> to pull the mobs one at a time. If one of your comrades is injured,
     heal them. Buff your tanks before entering battle. Fire off a DD every once in a while.
     And when you have nothing better to do, melee the mob. Basically, you should
     never be idle unless you are out of mana and need to meditate. Druids need to be
     constantly aware of the situation, and have to know what to do when. However, you are
     <b>supporting</b> the group, not leading it. You shouldn't expect do the most damage
     to the mob every time or deliver the killing blow. What you are doing is enhancing the
     group's efficiency, and that is what Druids are best at.
