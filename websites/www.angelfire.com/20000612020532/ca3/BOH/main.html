What was once fun, no longer is. I am greatful for the friends I have made and look forward to keeping those friends for years to come. I wish you all luck in whatever you do and now a few brief goodbyes:<p><p>
Tark: It was you and I in the beginning bro...it was great knowing you as a friend in real life and in the world of archers and legions. Hopefully, our girl friends will let us continue the make believe thru one game or another. You owe me beer man.<br><p>
Lord: Max, your a great guy...and you more than ever have put his heart, soul, and dedication into this clan. It will ALWAYS be appreciated. When I was ready to call it quits a long time ago...you reminded me what this was all about in the first place.<br><p>
Paladin: Bro...we will meet again man, get a name that you use to me and we will play side by side like always.<br><p>
Cent: Man...I hope all is well. You too stuck it out thru thick and thin. I will always remember that.<br><p>
Hawk: You have long since left AOE/ROR but you supported me at the beginning...I will always owe you one.<br><p>
Deth: Hey man...what can I say. Thanks for helping me/us out. Good luck in your games bro.<br><p>
Sniper: Although I could choke your ass sometimes...your a good guy man. Good luck.<br><p>

There are pages and pages more. I know I forgot some. But I will be in touch. Thanks for making friendships out of a hobby. Good luck to you all.</B>
