I like monkeys.
 The pet store was selling them for five cents a piece.  I thought that
 odd since they were normally a couple thousand.  I decided not to look a
 gift horse in the mouth.  I bought 200.  I like monkeys.
<p>
I took my 200 monkeys home.  I have a big car.  I let one drive.  His
 name was Sigmund.  He was retarded.  In fact, none of them were really
 bright.  They kept punching themselves in their genitals.  I laughed.
 Then they punched my genitals.  I stopped laughing.
   <p>
 I herded them into my room.  They didn't adapt very well to their new
 environment.  They would screech, hurl themselves off of the couch at
 high speeds and slam into the wall.  Although humorous at first, the
 spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour.
      <p>
 Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive:
 they all died.  No apparent reason.  They all just sorta' dropped dead.
 Kinda' like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later.  Damn
 cheap monkeys.
         <p>
 I didn't know what to do.  There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my
room, on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase.  It looked
 like I had 200 throw rugs.
            <p>
 I tried to flush one down the toilet.  It didn't work.  It got stuck.
 Then I had one dead, wet monkey and 199 dead, dry monkeys.
               <p>
I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals.  That worked for
 a while, that is until they began to decompose.  It started to smell real
 bad.
                  <p>
I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in the toilet and I didn't want
to call the plumber.  I was embarrassed.
                     <p>
 I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them.  Unfortunately,
 there was only enough room for two monkeys at a time so I had to change
them every 30 seconds.  I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so
 it didn't all go bad.
                        <p>
I tried burning them.  Little did I know my bed was flammable.  I had to
 extinguish the fire.
                           <p>
 Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in
 my freezer, and 197 dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed.  The odor
 wasn't improving.
                              <p>
 I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys and to use the
 bathroom.  I severely beat one of my monkeys.  I felt better.
                                 <p>
 I tried throwing them away but the garbage man said that the city was not
 allowed to dispose of charred primates.  I told him that I had a wet
one.  He couldn't take that one either.  I didn't bother asking about the
frozen ones.
                                    <p>
I finally arrived at a solution.  I gave them out as Christmas gifts.  My
friends didn't know quite what to say.  They pretended that they like
them, but I could tell they were lying.  Ingrates.  So I punched them in
the genitals.
 <p>
 I like monkeys.
