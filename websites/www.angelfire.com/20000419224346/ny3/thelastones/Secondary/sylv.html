<b>Character info: </B>Sylvarresta Mourningdove is a goofy, slightly irreverant ranger who
would genuinely do anything you asked of her within reason. Originally hailing from
Surefall Glade, she has always had problems staying in one place for long periods of time.
She feels as though she is currently on a hell level. Her favorite things to do include:
Harrassing Bedavard. Getting drunk and pretending to ice skate. Doing odd things while
camping an area, such as pondering aloud the pros and cons of rice versus noodles.
Shouting strange things in zones- for example, &quot;A rubber chicken clobbers YOU for 45
points of damage!&quot; &quot;You try to slash a rubber chicken, but a rubber chicken is
INVULNERABLE!&quot; &quot;Greetings, Sylvarresta, you look like you could use a rat
ear.&quot; And leading her party, who is autofollowing her, off of small topographical
raised edges, therefore causing each party member 4 to 5 points of damage as they follow
her. <br>
<br>
Sylv really is a good gal, though. <br>
