  'Ultigar was always somber and brooding, given to solitude and separation. But most of all, he was methodical and unwavering.  This alone molded him into a fine Shaman of the Six Hammers.  His pursuit of justice remains his sole purpose for existence.'
<br><p>
 -Aranthol Garson, Shaman of the Tribunal, Mentor of Ultigar

<br><br>

I was born, as most barbarians, in the snowy plains of Everfrost.  Near Halas, before the infestation of the Ice Goblins and Blackburrow gnolls, were small encampments consisting mostly of bear and mammoth hunters as well as smiths and brewers.  My father was a smith of fair talent, crafting warhammers and maces for the younger initiates of the Shamans of Justice.

<br><br>
Because of his affiliation with the Shamans, I was sent to Halas for tutelage in the ways of the shamanic arts.  I had shown a proficiency and oneness with the spirits of Everfrost and my father insisted that I not follow in his footsteps. He knew my talents would not make for a better warhammer. So, he contacted his friend, Aranthol Garson to take me away and put me under the watchful eye of the Tribunal.<br><br>

Several weeks into my training, I learned of increasing raids threatening the barbarian encampments.  I feared the worst for my father.  He was a fine smith, but a warrior, he was not.  Unable to leave my studies under Aranthol, I sent letters inquiring my father on the happenings back home.<br><br>

I was relieved to receive responses back from my father telling me of his days spent travelling to Freeport for ore and of the troubles mounting on the outskirts of the encampments.  In the last letter I received, he had just returned from a long sojourn to Erudin and would be staying a few weeks at home.  Though my father loved the snowy plains, his wanderlust always got the better of him.<br><br>

Hearing of my father's return, Aranthol sent me home for a few days of respite.  He asked that before I return that I pick up another shipment of weapons for the Shamans and the Wolves of the North.<br><br>

With that, I set off for home, excited about the few days I would have with my father.  I was eager to tell him about my studies and the things that I had learned. Most of all, I wanted to show my father a demonstration of the incantations that Aranthol had taught me.<br><br>

It took me a good few hours to get out onto the tundra.  Remembering my tutor's advice to stay away from the beasts of Everfrost, I avoided any contact with those animals that would prove too difficult for me to handle.<br><br>

My wandering thoughts stopped as I noticed something strange in the air.  Cries of pain echoed across the vastness of the tundra.  Gauging the direction they were coming from, I set off to investigate the situation.<br><br>

What I saw next stunned me.  A party of bear hunters lay in heaps of blood and death.  A great battle had been waged here and these fellow barbarians had lost.  Only a few survived as I tried frantically to heal them with what meager powers I possessed.  One of the survivors was strong enough to speak and warned me that a large war party of gnolls had clashed with them.  He pleaded for me to warn the Wolves of the North that this war party was breaking through and sacking the outlying encampments.<br><br>

I stood still.  This could not be happening.  The outlying encampments? My father?  What could I do at that moment?  Someone needed to stay here with these wounded people.  But I had to see if my father was okay.<br><br>

Suddenly, the wounded man grabbed hold of my arm and rasped,'There!'<br><br>

I turned to see several Blackburrow Gnolls heading back to our location. No doubt they had returned to finish off the survivors.<br><br>

With an unearthly roar, I cried out 'For the Tribunal!'<br><br>

I plunged into the thick of them, raining fire upon my quarry and crushing their skulls with my club.  My fury was unrelenting as I felled each one of the vile creatures until only the moans of the survivors I had saved broke the silence.
<br><br>
I was covered in the blood and gore of my enemies, but my fury was unquenched.<br><br>

Out of the ether of the dusk, two veteran shamans arrived and surveyed the battleground grimly.<br><br>

I reported my findings to them and told them I would scout the encampments and ascertain the situation.  But, they ordered me to stop.
<br><br>
'You are too young to be going about the tundra,' a veteran shaman stated.<br><br>

'I must go,' I cried out defiantly,' My father lives in one of those encampments!'<br><br>

'You are brave, young shaman, but these gnolls you bested were only pups.  If there is a raiding party from Blackburrow out there, it'll have tougher gnolls in it.'<br><br>

My mind raced frantically.  I had to see if my father was all right.  I had to go and see for myself if my father still lived.  Without warning, I bounded out into the tundra carelessly, ignoring the shouts from the veteran shamans.  When I stopped, darkness had settled and the tundra eerily called out with the strange and frightening sounds of the night.
<br><br>
I knew not where I was, but I sensed I was close to home.  Some of the surroundings looked familiar.<br><br>

Then I heard the howls of the enemy.  I felt that they were near and hid myself.  Not much later, the raiding party passed by me, muttering in their growling, guttural voices.<br><br>

'Bark, these barbarians are puny.  They not much for fighting, bark,' uttered one of the gnolls.<br><br>

'Grrrowlll, but this one had weapons.  We go back to Blackburrow with weapons,' growled another one.<br><br>

In the dim moonlight, I saw what that gnoll had in its hands.  It was one of my father's hammers.<br><br>

I stood up from my hiding place and began chanting my flame spell.  The gnolls all turned their heads in unison and saw me.  The one with my father's hammer started for me, but it's face burst into flame as I finished my incantation.  With that, I again plunged into the thick of the party, shouting and swinging my club hoping to hit any of them.<br><br>

But, these gnolls were far more skilled than the pups that I had fought earlier.  With each blow that I struck and missed, five more would rain down upon me until finally I succumbed to their attacks.  As I lay bleeding and dying upon the snow, the gnoll with my father's hammer pushed it's face towards mine and growled.  The stench of burnt fur and flesh reminded me of a charnel house.<br><br>

'You burn my face, barbarian.  I tear your face.'<br><br>

He then gouged my right eye and tore down my face.  I cried out more in frustration than in pain.  I was to die there in the tundra never knowing justice for the death of my father.<br><br>

Consciousness slipped from my broken body.  The sounds of the tundra and the howls of my enemy began fading.  But, as silence stilled my mind, I heard several voices chanting in the distance and the howls of my enemies crying out in agony.<br><br>

...<br><br>

I awoke in my bedchamber in Halas.  Weakness filled me. The dull pain of my defeat ached throughout my body.<br><br>

'You were lucky to survive Ultigar. You are a foolish young man.'<br><br>

I turned my head to see old Aranthol sitting next to my bed.  I closed my eyes as they began to water up in anger and sadness.  My father was dead.  He had to be.  And there was nothing that I could have done to change that fact.<br><br>

'The encampments are gone.  The settlers, the hunters...most of them were dead or dying when we finally arrived.  Your father...fought bravely, Ultigar.  There were a number of gnoll bodies around him.  He fought to the last,' Aranthol said regretfully.<br><br>

He got up from his chair and walked to the door.  Aranthol turned to me with sadness on his face.<br><br>

'Your father was never a warrior.  Only a smith content with his lot in life.  The Shamans of Justice will miss him greatly, Ultigar.  And we are relieved that you are still alive.  You fought bravely, but recklessly, my student.  Had you not run off and had just waited for the other shamans to arrive, more experienced shamans, your father would still have been dead.  And you would not be blind in your right eye.  Take care not to give in to your anger.'<br><br>

Aranthol opened the door and stepped out into the new day.  He stood there basking in the light.  He looked like a beacon of hope.  He then turned back and looked at me with the sternness of a teacher.
<br><br>
'As soon as you are feeling well, you and I will return to Everfrost and make our way into Blackburrow.  Let us see if we can bring more of those filthy dogs to justice and sate the price of your father's sacrifice.'<br><br>

It was a long time after Aranthol left that I got up from my bed.  My body found it difficult to walk and move, but I made my way to a wash bowl.  My face hurt most of all and as I stared into the bowl filling with water, I saw the angry red scar down my forehead and cheek, the milky white gaze of my blind eye.  I looked hard at my reflection, at the broken, humiliated face that stared back at me.
<br><br>
I vowed that day that the Sabertooths of Blackburrow would know the full extent of my vengeance.  That day, I became an engine of methodical fury.  I was a living extension of the Tribunal's justice. I would send those that destroyed the hope of Halas, the hope of all Norrath to the Nameless for the pain and suffering they had caused. That day, I began my war against all that would seek to turn Norrath to chaos.
<br><br>
And I promised my father that I would win that war.
