         The Nektulos Forest is a dark forest located to the north of the 
     Commonlands. It serves as the newbie area for the nearby Dark
     Elf city of Neriak. It doesn't do too good a job of it. There is
     a designated area for players around level 4 and under.
     The rest of the area is for higher-level newbies. Monsters from
     outside that area will not enter, offering a small level of protection. 
     The problem is that this
     lower-level area is <b>very</B> small. This means that if there
     are too many players here, you get <b>no</B> monsters. Also, 
     this area is so small that it's very easy to accidentally
     wander out and get attacked by a wolf or something. Almost all the 
     monsters here will aid their comrades if one of them is under attack. And when the zone is so
     small, and the monsters don't leave that zone, it's very easy
     to get mobbed by wandering monsters. The area outside of that
     small low-level area isn't much better. Out here, the only 
     wandering monsters are aggressive and will attack you on sight.
     Another thing that's <b>really</B> annoying is that these things
     called Guardians will kill any other monsters that they see. This
     can really get on your nerves: you're killing some monster, it takes
     5 minutes, you're almost done, and some Guardian comes along and kills
     it. There's another random danger to watch out for. Sometimes an
     Orc Runner will make a dash for the Neriak entrance. For some
     reason, this makes all the guards in the area attack evil
     races, which doesn't normally happen. Another problem is that there is very little loot here - no bags,
     boxes, armor, weapons, etc. 
         <p>
         <font size="5">Final Verdict</font><p>
         This place stinks. No loot and very few monsters to kill. I suggest
     you get out of here as soon as you can. If you want a good evil
     hunting zone, try the Innothule Swamp.<p>
