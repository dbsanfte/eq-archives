<h1 align=center>STRANGE LAWS</h1>
<basefont size=4>

<font size=+2></font>
<ul>
<li>After Sex Refreshment: A man in Ames, Iowa can be arrested for taking more than three gulps of beer while in bed after sex.
<p>
<li>No Freezer Sex: In Newcastle, Wyo., it is against the law for couples to have sex in a butcher's freezer. How many couples would have sex in a freezer, let alone a butcher's freezer?
<p>
<li>No Floor Sex: In Sioux Falls, S.D., it is against the law to have sex on the floor between beds. A local law requires all hotel rooms to have twin beds no less than two feet apart if a couple rents a room for one night. Might be a good time to try the bath tub.
<p>
<li>Curtains Required: In Carlsbad, N.M., it is legal for couples to have sex during lunch break in their car or van as long as they have the curtains closed. And you told the boss you were going to grab a bite. Yeah, right.
<p>
<li>No Moosing Around: A law in Fairbanks, Alaska makes it illegal for two moose to have sex on the sidewalk. No news yet if this law has had to be enforced. Some animal rights advocates may find this law discriminatory, because it does not apply to dogs or cats.
<p>
<li>Can't Wear That: A warning to all women: if you plan on going to Cleveland, Ohio, you might not want to wear patent leather shoes or you could be arrested. A local law makes it illegal for women to wear them because they may reflect up their dress.
<p>
<li>Men Can't Shoot: In the small town of Connorsville, Wis., it is illegal for a man to shoot his gun while his female partner has an orgasm. Now this law is taking the notion of safe sex to a new extreme.
