Bombure grew up as the middle member of a very large family, and his best friends growing
up were is brothers Gimlie, Bofur, Oin, and Gloin. The brothers were always adventuring in
the depths of their home under the mountain, Kaladim. As Bombure grew up, he discovered
that pain is the worst thing one can do to another, and felt strongly enough about this to
enter the Temple of Brell Serilis and declare his wish to become a cleric, to train in the
ways of healing the hurt of the world. Bombure became quite the sage, piling through the
archives like a whirlwind devouring all the great lore offered in the temple. He was
granted his first robe of his station, and bid, go out into the lands of Norath, heal the
wounds of the world, and make right the wrongs of other men. It is to this that Bombure
devotes his life, keeping his friends and party safe from harm always. May Brell Serilis
guard thee and keep thee safe one and all.</font></p>

Honor</strong></font></p>

<p align="left">&quot;Medal of Honor&quot; awarded to Knights Belledonna, Darkian, Kallie,
and Bombure. On the dates of Jan 23, &amp; 24th, this party of brave adventurers stood toe
to toe with an evil KSer Wizard Dangt, courageously guarding their camp spot against the
invading KSer. On both of these evenings the vile Dangt train killed our party, not once
but twice, and still these brave knights returned to reclaim not only their bodies, but
their rightful camp spot and to confront the evil Dangt and demand that he cease and
desist. The GMs were petitioned, and on both nights these courageous knights risked life
and experience again in order for the GM to witness such unjust conduct of the evil Dangt.
And I am proud to say that on each night, the GMs acknowledged their right, and sternly
issued a warning against the player record of Dangt. Hail and Well Met brave Knights
Belledonna, Darkian, Kallie and Bombure! For your brave acts you are hereby awarded the
TLO &quot;Medal of Honor&quot;! </p>

of Justice</strong></font></p>

<p align="left">&quot;Defender of Justice&quot; awarded to Knights Belledonna, Darkian,
Kallie, Bombure, Carnus, Galivious, Izlaaru, Klithor, and Goad. On the date of Jan 25th,
Izlaaru, Klithor, and Goad answered the call for protection from a vile KSer Dangt in
Beholders Gorge from a rightful camping party of players Belledonna, Darkian, Kallie,
Carnus, and Galivious. These 3 knights gave of their time selflessly to travel to the
gorge, defend the rightful party, and courageously confronted the vile Dangt to cease and
desist, and tactfully petitioned GMs to please appear and defend the rightful party.
Although the party members were the target of the KSer, they are still to be recognized
with the Defender of Justice award for their courage and determination, and also for their
participation and tactfully petitioning the GM on the behalf of justice. I am proud to
say, that justice was indeed bestowed upon the valiant knights of TLO as the GM Cammii
appeared, warned Dangt of his past transgressions, and then before everyone's eyes to
behold, she summarily banned Dangt from Norath. the GM reiterated that it was not
tonight's event of KSing that caused Dangt to be banned, but his transgressions in the
past, and for twice warnings against Train Killing parties Sunday and Monday nights, and
to reiterate that KSing is not a bannable offence, but Train Killing is. Hail and Well Met
brave Knights! For your brave deeds this night, you are all hereby dubbed &quot;Defenders
of Justice&quot;!</p>
