Princess Firiona Vie is a lengend within the world of Norrath.  Many a bards spin tells of epic proportions about the Princess who is known in all the lands of Norrath as the right hand of the goddess Tunare.  At the lost continent of Kunark there can be found a large statue (within the elven outpost) errected in memorial to her.  Princess Firiona Vie was last seen traveling out from the Elven Outpost into the wild and untamed lands of Kunark with a small band of heroes.  None of which returned.  Bards have it that she was captured and remains enslaved by an Iksar Lich named Venril Sathir, although these rumors have as of yet to be shown true.<p>
