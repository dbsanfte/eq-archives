First off, let me start by saying walls, for a Hittite, are part of the game. If you feel walls are cheap, a sign of weak play, or a rookie tactic (and I’m talking about built walls, not phantom) then I would be willing to bet you are a Choson player. You probably rarely if ever have played as Hittite, and you are certainly not an expert Hit, or at the very least as a Hit, don’t face many expert Cho’s. When I say “walls” I mean walls used to develop choke points, fortify farms/houses/tc’s/river crossings and that are backed usually by HHA’s/Hcat’s/towers. These walls have purpose. They are deliberate and strategic, within FPR sanctioned rules. These walls are much different than what many people call  “turtling”. Turtling is the desperate act of cutting yourself off from the rest of the board and often the last line of defense against a swarming flooder civ.<br>
That being said, If you as a Choson have forced a Hit to wall into his primary base (turtle), the game is over, walls for a Hit are only effective when used along with an offense. The only time this may not be true is if a majority of the game has been offensive for the Hit, and he has acquired most of the gold and stone from the board, and then he turtles. In this case, he can sit back and wait for you to waste your legions at his walls (bleed your gold), and possibly nurse whatever remaining piles he may have in his fortification.<br> 
An expert Cho will have fully upgraded towers and legion around the 3 to 3.5-min mark and have pop somewhere around 8-9. Further more, an expert Cho can usually tear down walls with ease.  A turtled Hit can essentially expect to be out of the game by 10-15 minutes, maybe a half hour depending on how much time the Cho gave the Hit to set up a defense. (An expert Cho WILL NOT let this happen.) Obviously the key here then for a Hit, is to avoid turtling at all costs. Your really just delaying the inevitable (against better players).<br> 
So now you may ask yourself  “I’m a decent Choson, but for some reason I can’t get past the walls, what am I doing wrong?”  First, you must understand that the little space and time the wall gives the Hit can provide him the opportunity to easily counter a poorly planned Choson siege. The Hit will counter Legion with HHA’s/towers and Cho towers/heles with Heavy cats. If you continue this poorly planned method of wasting our units at his walls, he may eventually be able to make an offensive push, and when your resources are low it’s the last thing you want to have happen.<br>
As soon as the Hit turtles, secure and mine every gold/stone pile available. If you hit him early he many not be able to include his initial piles into his fortification, so take them too. If you can get his piles you just cut the game’s time in half. The 3 units that are going to crack those walls are:<br> 1.) Towers (villagers to build them)<br>
2.)Priests<br>
3.)Legion<br>
Start off by having those villagers mining stone like crazy. You’re going to need those towers (and make sure you have your market upgrade for range, you’ll need that too.) As your villagers are mining stone, make sure you have enough villagers on farms. There is absolutely no way to avoid wasting legion in this case, in fact using them as HHA/Hcat/tower fodder is a key to this plan. Build up an initial siege force in AOE consisting of:<br>
A group of 20 villagers.<br>
15-20 priests.<br>
100 legion<br>
(Logistics in ROR frees up a lot of space, I would recommend filling it with priests, in theory, you could martyr a majority of his defense.)<br>
The rest of your pop should be comprised of farmers/miners. Take everything that you can.
Make sure you use the hotkeys to group and label/select your 20 villagers into 2 groups of 10, label them “1” and “2”.  These are your tower builders, they are the key to tearing down walls and eliminating HHA’s. You now have 7 hotkey slots left. Use the hotkeys to select and label 7 priests, filling up slots 3-9. The priests in AOE are your Hcat defense. (In ROR use them to take everything that moves behind that wall, remember he has one gold pile) Convert them are soon as you can. If you get one, try to get off a shot into his HHA’s before it dies.<br>
The attack:<br>
Send your first wave of legions into one of his walls. By this time you have already scouted every single possible entrance into his base. You have made sure there aren’t any openings amongst the trees or possibly a backdoor, and you have selected the wall that has the least amount of layers/towers.  If he has cats, and is a poor micro manager they will most likely assist you in tearing down a wall  by firing on your legion. If he has any skill he will only pull the cats up to fire on your towers. Use the hotkeys to select your villager groups and have them start putting up towers. If he roles out a cat covert it, use it against his HHA’s. By now, his HHA’s are shredding through your legion, however, as soon as a tower goes up the tide turns. As soon as your pop limit will let you train another wave of legion, and send them back at the wall. Continually put up towers. Target the towers on HHA's and if possible aim a few at a space on the wall to open it up. Start the flood of legion. Game over.<br>
I would also recommend putting up at least one tower at every possible exit from his fortification. These are not offensive towers, but towers to alert you of fleeing villagers. Hunt them down and wipe them out.<br>
All in all, getting through the wall can take 5 minutes or it can take 20 minutes, but you'll be in, he'll be dead, and you have yourself another victory..</B>
