         The Innothule Swamp, situated in the South of Antonica, is the perfect
     home for its native trolls: wet, dank, and gloomy. This is the newbie area for the adjacent troll city
     of Grobb. However, caution must be exercised while hunting here, or
     sooner or later you'll find yourself staring at that familiar message:
     LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... Many
     of the monsters that wander around here are aggressive and will attack
     on sight, and will also group with their comrades against you if you're
     endangering one of ther kind. You can easily become swarmed with enemies.
     Staying near guards and grouping will help this problem, but not totally
     solve it. At the same time, you have to watch out for the deep water portions of the swamp. Falling in here without a good swimming skill
     could be a problem, so watch out. There are also a few human NPC's that
     patrol the area around Guk, to the east of the zone. They don't
     particularly like "evil" races, so watch your back. However, all
     this danger does not come without rewards. The creatures here are
     plentiful, and the player population is generally low. Even better,
     a lot of the monsters carry some item of value. By far the most
     profitable monsters are the frogloks. A good portion of them carry
     magical cloth armor, wanted by monks everywhere. This can sell for
     incredible profit to players and merchants alike.
         <p>
         <font size="5">Final Verdict</font><p>
         My suggestion would be to get a good group and go hunt frogloks. 
     Sell the armor and watch the dough roll in. There are a <b>lot</B>
     of opportunities for you to end up dead, but if you're careful,
     the rewards can more than outweigh the danger.
