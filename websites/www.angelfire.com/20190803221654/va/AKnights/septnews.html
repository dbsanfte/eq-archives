<p class="headline">Thursday, September 23</p>
<p><font color="#3068D0"><i><b>Out of character news</b></i></font></p>
<p>Greetings friends. I thought I would take a second and explain my absence in 
  game lately. </p>
<p>The fourth week of college has gotten here and it seems that I have either 
  a paper, speech, or exam in every class! Needless to say, RL is extremely busy. 
  As I told the officers, my last project is due on Monday and after that things 
  should get back to normal (although I have said that before...). I did manage 
  to hop on long enough to update with some news and to update the <a href="file:///C%7C/Angelfire%20Page/Old%20web%20page%20stuff/RosterReport.html">roster</a>.</p>
<p><b><i><font color="#3068D0">Plea from Sasin Nighteye of OSS</font></i></b></p>
<p>I thought that some of you level 30+ guys may be interested in this plea (from 
  <a href="http://www3.bravenet.com/forum/fetch.php?id=2802472&amp;userid=pf271561">The 
  Alliance message board</a>) of aid from a new brother in the alliance:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Fellow Brethren of the Alliance! </i></p>
  <p><i>Well to met to all I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting! </i></p>
  <p><i>I am known as Sansin Nighteye, Paladin of the 30th (forever) Circle. </i></p>
  <p><i>The purpose of this message is to send a plea for help to all my new friends 
    here in the Alliance. As a Paladin, it is my sworn duty to dispatch any and 
    all of the evil undead which inhabit this fair land of ours. To better accomplish 
    this goal, I am seeking to obtain a powerful Paladin weapon : the Ghoulbane. 
    </i></p>
  <p><i>This weekend, I am planning on a delve to obtain this item for the better 
    good of the noble folk of Norrath. I now put the request to any and all of 
    the Alliance brethren to aid me in this quest. I plan on starting Saturday 
    Morning sometime...and staying until the goal is accomplished.</i></p>
  <p><i>If you are interested in furthering this quest, please let me know here 
    or on The OSS board...or simply contact me IG. I would think any player around 
    my level (30) would benefit from this delve also as there are other items 
    and great EXP and loot to be found in GUK! </i></p>
  <p><i>Hope to hear from you all and please let me know if there is anything 
    I can help you with! </i></p>
  <p><i>Sansin Nighteye <br>
    Lieutenant <br>
    Order of Shifting Sands </i></p>

<p><b><i><font color="#3068D0">The Alliance is formed</font></i></b></p>
<p>I am proud to announce a newly formed alliance with the <a href="http://nwn.thixo.net/">Noble 
  Warriors of Norrath</a> and the <a href="http://www.tmerlo.com/eq/">Order of 
  Shifting Sands</a>! Tonight we meant and discussed the goals and desires that 
  we have for this alliance, as well as the concerns. It was agreed that the alliance 
  would be for friendship and events only. No military alliance was formed, meaning 
  if they have a guild war we do not have to go to war with them. I am excited 
  about the future of this alliance, and the things that lie ahead. I volunteered 
  to make a web page for the alliance which I now have completed:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/va2/thealliance/%5C">http://www.angelfire.com/va2/thealliance/</a></p>
<p>Check it out, and be sure to leave a message on the message board!</p>
<p><b>Serro Deimos - 11:40 PM EST</b></p>

<p><b><i><font color="#3068D0">Update to the page</font></i></b></p>
<p>I have updated the <a href="file:///C%7C/Angelfire%20Page/Old%20web%20page%20stuff/WeaponsandArmorRepor.html">Weapons and Armor Report</a> 
  and the <a href="file:///C%7C/Angelfire%20Page/Old%20web%20page%20stuff/ResearchItemsReport.html">Research Item Report</a>. Also the 
  <a href="file:///C%7C/Angelfire%20Page/Old%20web%20page%20stuff/treasury.html">treasury page</a> has been updated with the correct 
  amount of money the guild now holds. If you paid your dues last night, the roster 
  should reflect that and there should no longer be a &quot;$&quot; by your name.</p>
<p>Tonight Aslan, Snydar, and myself will be going to a summit to discuss our 
  alliance with the Noble Warriors of Norrath and the Order of Shifting Sands. 
  I will have more info about that when the summit is over. See you all in Norrath 
  later tonight hopefully.</p>

<p><b><i><font color="#3068D0">OOC stuff</font></i></b></p>
<p>Hello everyone! It has been awhile since I updated the page, and this can be 
  blamed on a number of things. For one, I started a new job and need some time 
  to get adjusted and work around it. Next week, and from now on, I will not have 
  to work as much and I can spend more time doing what I would like to do. =) 
</p>
<p>More importantly than that though was the fact that Guildboss (the program 
  that helps me keep track of everyone and makes the rosters for me) has been 
  out of commission for almost a week. For that reason I decided against updating 
  the page until it was working again. Well, it is and I am updating.</p>
<p><i><b><font color="#3068D0">Festival</font></b></i></p>
<p>There is an idea that I have been playing with in my mind for sometime (thanks 
  to a suggestion made by Zydar), and that is a &quot;Caster's Convention&quot;. 
  There is A LOT that we could do with this idea, and I am currently putting my 
  ideas together and later will give you more information as soon as I get it 
  ready. I would like to hold these in several places, and I think we should start 
  in Queynos. From Queynos we can work our way west and have them in every town 
  and zone we are able to. Some of the things I would like to do are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>- Games. I mean, come up with festival, &quot;chase the pig&quot; type of 
    games. Maybe &quot;chase the Eye of Zomm&quot; =)<br>
    - Teaching languages for donations<br>
    - Selling caster items<br>
    - Helping with others research and other skills<br>
    - Contest</li>
</ul>
<p>The good news is I already have several of these areas covered. I have came 
  up with at least two games that I think would work very well, and there has 
  already been discussion of a contest we could hold on the message board.</p>
<p>Starting now, I do need a favor from all members (especially the high level 
  ones). We need caster items. Good ones like FBRs, Oracle Robes, Staff of Observers, 
  Dragoon Dirks, Gossimer Robes, Woven Armor, ect. I would like to have at least 
  one really good caster item to give away in the contest. I know these items 
  are hard to get, and very expensive. Do not worry yourself to death and get 
  yourself killed several times for an item the guild is going to give away. If 
  you can safely get a good item, please do so.</p>
<p>As of now, this is all the information I can really give you. I would like 
  to hold the festival in the next week or two and I am going to make sure it 
  is announced on every EQ page I can get it on. See you all in game later this 
  week. </p>

<p><font color="#3068D0"><b><i>Guild headquarters</i></b></font> </p>
<p>Earlier today while I was at college, I made a post on the message board suggesting 
  a guild headquarters as an alternative to the guild staying in one area of Norrath 
  (as I suggested a few days ago). Now, there is one thing I need to make clear. 
  This would be an unofficial headquarters as Verant has NOT implemented a way 
  to buy real estate. This is a HIGHLY requested feature, and we will know when 
  that feature is added. The guild does not have enough money anyway, as I expect 
  real estate to be around 100,000 plat. So if you do desire us to one day own 
  a &quot;guildhouse&quot;, then you need to do two things. First, e-mail Verant 
  every time you get online about adding the ability to buy real estate. Secondly, 
  donate as much money to the guild as you can spare, or at least pay your dues. 
  I have not spent a dime of the guilds money yet, but we still only have around 
  500 plat in the bank. </p>
<p>For now, stop by the <a href="http://www3.bravenet.com/forum/show.asp?userid=px136494">message 
  board</a> and post your suggestions for a headquarters, and we will work from 
  there. See you all in Norrath.</p>
<p><font color="#3068D0"><b><i>A story about the Blackburrow event</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><i>Gnolls, Gnolls and more Gnolls!<br>
    </i></b><i><u>A story relating the actions of our Knights in Blackburrow</u></i></p>
  <p><i>The evening started like an ordinary evening in the wonderful world of 
    Norrath. The stars were shining and a mild wind was ruffling my hair. A good 
    night for hunting it seemed. </i></p>
  <p><i>After taking a deep breath and relaxing a bit, I heard some of our brothers 
    and sisters talking through our mind link. The discussion seemed mostly to 
    center around a named Dungeon called Blackburrow, home of the gnolls. Well 
    did I remember that dreadful place from my younger days for I had hunted there 
    in the past and still had occasional nightmares about it! After listening 
    for a while to the mind link discussion, I understood that my evening plans 
    had suddenly became clear. People in Blackburrow were in need of us Arcane 
    Knights. Thus did I start on my journey to the Qeynos region.</i></p>
  <p><i>While I was making my journey over the rolling plains of Karanas, the 
    knights party was slowly getting organized. Our sister Crystala went to hunt 
    some bats to get their wings in order to provide us with the required components 
    for making the mighty magic of levitation. Other knights also started making 
    their way to Blackburrow, coming from all corners of the world. On my way 
    to that much awaited gathering, I stopped at Qeynos to get some extra food 
    and some more spell components. By that time some of our brothers and sisters 
    had already reached the gathering place, the entrance of the Blackburrow dungeon. 
    </i></p>
  <p><i>As soon as I entered Blackburrow, I was stricken speechless by one of 
    the most impressive sight: 10 of our brethren were gathered in the Dungeon. 
    Quickly it was decided the best way to help the good people of Norrath would 
    be to watch the bridge area. Some of our brothers and sisters were thus dispatched 
    to that location while I stayed near the entrance to help people and to watch 
    for any groups of gnolls that get passed our brothers attention at the bridge. 
    Let me tell you how proud I was of our knights since my post was more or less 
    boring as almost no gnolls ever made it alive to the entrance. Some of our 
    brothers magicians also provided free summoned items to all in need. Seeing 
    as the bridge area was under our control, some brothers went patrolling deeper 
    in the dungeon to see if any needed help. People could now safely hunt the 
    dungeon knowing that we were there if they were in need. Of course, as we 
    Arcane Knights have knowledge of magic, that part of our heritage was put 
    to good use. People came to see us so we could provide them with healing and 
    empower them with our mighty character enhancing magics.</i></p>
  <p><i>All in all it was a glorious evening for us Arcane Knights. People enjoyed 
    our presence and some even inquired as to our guild purpose looking for apprenticeship. 
    The tales of courage and honor of that night are too numerous to relate here 
    in this letter. Since our mind link cannot let us share more than words I 
    could not see yet through our brothers eyes to witness all the mighty deeds 
    of that guild event. Maybe we should try to search for some mighty magic that 
    would let us all share our actions by seeing through each other eyes. I will 
    look into this. I cannot remember all the names of our brothers and sisters 
    that were present that night, but I must thank them all for participating. 
    I must also make special mention of our brother Khala efforts to join us; 
    efforts that ended in an untimely death I am sorry to say. The gods have been 
    clement and have let him reincarnate so he could continue to better the people

<p><b><i><font color="#3366CC">Goodwill party</font></i></b></p>
<p>A lot has been going on the past few days in the guild. On Thursday we had 
  a goodwill party in Blackburrow, where our guild became very popular for stopping 
  the infamous and deadly Blackburrow trains. Apart from helping people, the guild 
  had a blast and I heard several comments about how much fun the event was, and 
  questions as to where the next &quot;party&quot; would be.I have thought about 
  it and think that we will do it in Queynos Hills next time, and then work our 
  way through the Karanas and so on.</p>
<p><b><i><font color="#3366CC">Keeping the guild together</font></i></b></p>
<p><b>It would be wonderful if all the guild would try to hang around Queynos 
  and the Karanas (for now) together so that we will all be together and can help 
  each other out and hunt together</b>. In general I feel that from now on members 
  could try to stay in and around one area so members could hunt together, and 
  seek each others aid more readily. I think that you should want to do this anyway. 
  Now, I have not been to good about staying in one place myself, so I am as guilty 
  as any of you. I am not saying that you can never leave the Karanas, or saying 
  you need permission to leave Queynos. I like to explore as much as any or you, 
  but think about this scenario: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Charisa and Apolyion and both interested in going to Mistmoore to take on 
    the many vampires that lurk in the castles cursed halls. IF Charisa and Apolyion 
    were around the Karanas with the rest of the guild, they could simply say 
    they were forming a group to go to Mistmoore, and BAM! </p>
  <p>A guild party! No prior announcements needed!!! Much easier than having to 
    travel all over Norrath to find members if you ask me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Don't think we are going to STAY around Queynos. As our goodwill parties move 
  east, so will the the location I would like you to try and stay. This could 
  be a FANTASTIC way for us to get to know each other better, as well as Norrath, 
  and hope you will all be willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>You may not like the idea, you may love it. It is just a suggestion and I cannot 
  make you stay anywhere. It would just be really nice I think. The decision is 
  yours.</p>
<p><b><i><font color="#3366CC">Raid on Kerra Isle</font></i></b></p>
<p>To further illustrate how much fun staying around the same area could be, I 
  would like to share about and adventure that Apolyion, Charisa, and I had last 
  night.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>That Darn Cat<br>
    By: Serro Deimos</i></p>
  <p><i>Dawn had fallen upon Toxxulia forest. The sounds of the forest filled 
    the crisp air of the woods, as life began to return to the forest after the 
    cold night. Three Arcane Knights sat at the dock on the western shore of the 
    forest. They had just killed the one that the Gatecallers call &quot;the heretic&quot;, 
    and were discussing the next adventure they should embark on. They all remembered 
    and discussed their days on a small island, located a few minutes off the 
    shore where they sat. It was called Kerra, and was home to many cat people. 
    The three knights decided to leave for the island immediately, and take revenge 
    on the cats for the way that had been treated by them in their youth. I, Serro, 
    was one of the knights. </i></p>
  <p><i>When we finally got there, we found that nothing had changed, and everything 
    appeared as it did so long ago. It was very quite and little was heard accept 
    for the pounding of waves upon the shore, the light breeze that swept through 
    the small village, and the meows of hundreds of cats. As we walked in we notice 
    cats on all sides of us, who all glared at us, as if to dare us to go any 
    further. In our younger days, these cats would have jumped on us, but now 
    they knew that such a decision would be a very unhealthy one. We continued 
    across the brown bridge and continued our journey around Kerra. After a short 
    distance, the trail we were on suddenly opened up. To our left, we could see 
    a small, run down dock. To the right, was a building, that's use was unknown. 
    But there, straight ahead, as far as the eye could see, was an enormous army 
    of cats. We slowly walked through the crowd. The hatred that they had for 
    us was apparent in their eyes, but none dared to make a move. Our eyes moved 
    back in forth quickly searching for the slightest hint of movement. Then it 
    happened. I do not know who attacked first. It may have been the cats, it 
    may have been us, but that spark triggered the entire army to converge on 
    us. At first, we felt that the battle would be hopeless, but soon found out 
    that we were stronger than we were in the days of our youth, and the big, 
    bad cats of Kerra had become kittens. With pets summoned and spells blazing, 
    we began to terminate every cat in site. The death squeals of cats echoed 
    across the island, as Apolyion said, &quot;I have been out of mana for the 
    last six kills!&quot; After several minutes of utter chaos, and may furballs, 
    things began to slow down. Needless to say, there were dead cats everywhere. 
    From shore to shore of Kerra, the island was littered with the remains of 
    cats who had fell prey to a very dangerous party of Arcane Knights. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was one casually suffered when Apolyion's pet got a little out our hand 
  and decided to make a train, which wound up running over top of me. Fortunately 
  I was bound to the island. It was indeed a VERY good time, and we would like 
  to take the guild there sometime to reek even more havoc than we did last night. 
  Below are some screenshots I took of the &quot;Kitty Killing&quot;. =)</p>

<p class="headline">Wedding, Update, and OOC Quest</p>
<p><b><i>A Wedding</i></b></p>
<p><b>A big congratulations to <b>Charisa</b> and <b>Apolyion</b> who are suppose 
  to be wed sometime tonight by a GM. We all wish you happiness and prosperity 
  in your life together.</b> </p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Updates to links page</i></b></p>
<p align="left">I have made a major update to the <a href="file:///C%7C/Angelfire%20Page/Old%20web%20page%20stuff/links.html">links page</a>. 
  Check out some of the sites I added. I also made a list of my personal favorites. 
  I would like to thank <b>Starlan</b> for providing me with the majority of the 
  links I added.</p>
<p><b><i>**OOC Quest - Developing the strategy section</i></b></p>
<p>Finally, I have a request from all members. I would like to expand our 4 with 
  more strategy guides and info, but I cannot do it all alone. Here are the type 
  of things I am looking for:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>- Guides to certain classes<br>
    - Guides to certain trades<br>
    - Guides to certain areas<br>
    - Guides to certain quest<br>
    - How and where to gain rare items</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't worry about your level. Suppose you are a level 24 wizard, just write 
  a strategy guide for a wizard from level 1 to 24. Again, if you are only average 
  in Jewel Craft, just write a guide on how to get to average in Jewel Craft. 
  You can always add to your strategy guide later or write a new one. I would 
  especially like to see some guides on how to get certain items. If you know 
  how to obtain a rare items, let everyone know! Don't assume that everyone knows 
  how to get it. </p>
<p>This is actually a good way to recruit members. If we get a nice strategy section, 
  we will get more hits, thus more application, and thus more members. For that 
  reason, those who submit strategies <i>(that I decide post on the web page)</i> 
  will receive points in my journal of deeds. This is how I keep track of members 
  who deserve promotion. The amount of points will depend on the guide.</p>
<p>Another thing that I would like to create is a price guide to items in Norrath. 
  This is something that is needed. It seems that no other web page offers such 
  a listing, and to have something like that could generate THOUSANDS of hits 
  for the page. For that reason, I am offering a extra special reward to the member 
  who types up a thorough, accurate price guide to be placed on the page. If you 
  would like to submit price list for just a few items, feel free to do that also.</p>
<p>To submit your strategies simply type them in an e-mail, or (if you really 
  want to get on my good side) type them in Microsoft Word or HTML and e-mail 
  them to me as an attachment. I will not take credit for you work, and promise 
  to recognize you for you hard work, unless you wish to remain anonymous. </p>
<p>I look forward to seeing your submissions. If you have any questions, feel 
  free to e-mail me at my new e-mail (seeing as Telebot is shutting down) address 
  <a href="mailto:serro@kimbanet.com">serro@kimbanet.com</a>.</p>

<h3 align="left" class="headline">Meeting summary</h3>
<p align="left">Well, I got a little break this weekend as I was out of town on 
  Saturday and Sunday, but now I am back and it is time to get down to business. 
  For those of you who didn't attend the meeting, I will try to sum up what happened.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Dues system changes</i></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>First off we discussed a way to simplify the due collection and donation 
    processes. There will now be three guild bankers in three separate towns who 
    you will give dues, as well as item donations to. Below is the list of towns, 
    and the bankers name.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Queynos-- Cendora<br>
      Rivervale-- (will announce later)<br>
      Freeport-- Arial</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When you are online search for one of the names above or just me, Serro. 
    If you have a donation or due, I will gladly log on as the appropriate banker 
    and accept you due of donation. To make things really simple, the bankers 
    will be logged off at the banks in the towns they are in (for exsample, Cendora 
    is logged off at the bank in Queynos so you will go there if you wish to make 
    a donation in Queynos). That way, you will always no where to go to find them. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><i>Alliance</i></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The second item that was discussed at the meeting was a possible alliance 
    with two other guilds in Norrath. One of which is the Noble Warriors of Norrath, 
    and I have unfortunately not talked much with the other guild, and am not 
    sure of their name. This week, we are suppose to have a summit meeting with 
    the 2 guilds to discuss the alliance and the conditions and details of it. 
    In attendence to the meeting will be myself, Snydar, and Aslan. Once we recieve 
    more information on this alliance I will let you know. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><b>Goodwill party to Blackburrow</b></i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Finally, the last major topic discussed was a guild event that will take 
    place this week. </p>
  <p><b>On Thursday, Sept. 9 at 10 PM EST</b>, a goodwill party of out guild members 
    will be leaving for Blackburrow. The purpose of this journey will be to enter 
    Blackburrow and help out the citizens by offering free buffs, healing, items, 
    and by stopping trains. It also will be a good time to recruit members and 
    to help increase our reputation within Norrath. I hope that as many of you 
    that can will attend the event.</p>
