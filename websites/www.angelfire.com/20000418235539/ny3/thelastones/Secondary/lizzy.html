From the days of my youth I remember many things. I remember awaking in the city of Qeynos
in a different land far away from my home and being forced to learn the skills of an
enchanter. I fought valiantly and bravely as my skills increased. And one day the
unthinkable happened for I was robbed of all my earthly possessions. Left without food or
drink I desperately cried across the zone &quot;Can someone please help this poor
enchanter!&quot; A kind soul heard my voice and answered my cries and he gave me all the
money that I had lost. I have never forgot the kindness of that man and now that I'm older
I strive to be like him so that I might influence others the way he did for me. Having
practiced harder I travelled to Eruds Crossing where I spent hours upon hours killing
wisps for their lightstones which brightened up the darkness as well as my pocket book.
From my hours spent in the mistical land of the cat people I obtained an identity and it
is due this that I received the last name Britestone for all of my troubles. Those
lightstones lite the way for many travellers as I hope I have done to those who know me. I
have made many good friends while journeying the lands frome whom I am always to hear
from. A good friend once taught me the art of fishing which I have never forgotten. For
now I am a wanderer without a purpose while I wait for Carnus to improuve his skill. I am
attempting to do the same but rather I seem to have perfected the art of corpse retrieval.
As I look back on my days in Norrath I know that I am not the most skilled fighter, but
that I always tried my best and that I may misplace things my intentions are always good.
I hope those who know me will remember with the smiley face I was quick to put on every
tell. So as I strive forward in my quest for glory I always remember the saying &quot;This
is not the end. It is not even the begining of the end. But it is perhaps the end of the
begining.&quot; <br>
