         Everfrost is a frozen landscape in the northern part of Antonica.
     Snowfall is constant, and the ground of the entire region is 
     blanketed in a thick snow cover. This zone represents both the
     newbie zone for the barbarian city of Halas, and a much higher-level 
     hunting ground for other players. The zone is divided 
     into two regions: the canyons and the plains. he plains are a higher-level
     area, and under no circumstances would I recommmend venturing out
     here unless under the guidance of a more powerful player. You will
     be spending almost all of your time here in the canyons. The hunting
     is plentiful and good here. You can just sit at one of the canyon
     walls, picking off creatures as they go by, and rake in the experience and cash.
     Almost all the creatures carry some item
     of value, even at lower levels. There isn't much danger here if you
     know what you're doing. Ice Goblin Whelps and Gnoll Pups (first level monsters) are
     aggressive towards you and will attack without provocation, and there
     is a chance of being swarmed by them. This can be fatal, even at higher
     levels. Also, I would recommmend that you not hunt the wolves; when
     you have killed enough wolves, they all become mad at you, and will
     attack on sight. There are wolves in half the zones in Antonica, and
     having them all mad at you is <b>not</B> a good thing. Also, there
     are now three dangerously powerful skeletons roaming the canyons.
     They won't attack you on sight, but be sure to /con every skeleton
     you can before you attack.
         <p>
         <font size="5">Final Verdict</font><p>
         Everfrost is a great zone for starting a character, as long as you stay in the canyon
         The monsters are plentiful and rich. Just be careful not to get swarmed, and you'll
         be fine.
