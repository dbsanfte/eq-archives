Though departed in body, the soul of Ralfo still remains strong with The Last Ones.  The vision he helped to start has grown and prospered.
<br>
Ralfo will never be forgotten as the leader who brought us all together and helped form what is now the great guild TLO
<br><br>
Ralfo Stormraider was a happy young halfling druid who loved to fish and make clothes. He decided to be a druid because he always loved to make things go boom. When he was little, he used to die all the time. Now he is alot older and dies all the time. When he was fairly young, he was in a group of fellow halflings that partied to gether all the time. One of these halflings, named Kadelpexel, told ralfo he was starting a guild. Ralfo decided that the guild would be exciting and it would be a great deed to be one of the founding members of the guild. He was the last of the original 10 members to sign up. Ralfo made alot of friends in his new guild like Nrokfo (now bloodspeaker), Malek( now secret), Smirt, Elaya( Alora now), and Goad. Ralfo was very content in the guild, even though they didn't really do anything. One day he came on Everquest and saw that barely any of his guild friends were on. He asked and people told him that the guild was dead and that kadelpexel left EQ. Ralfo was sad at this because he didn't want the guild he started to fade away. So he and a few friends began making plans about how to keep the guild together. Being one of the 10 original members, he felt it was his duty to lead the small group of members. At the time, there was 15 members still in TLO. Ralfo and friends held a guild meeting, decided to stay together, and once again began recruitment. With some divine intervention of our now dearly departed GM Kelsiferous, Ralfo was made the official leader. Shortly after members began flocking to our doors seeking membership, and TLO is now a thriving guild with active members and real goals, a long step from the early days.    <p>Ralfo hunts everywhere. he can teleport so he just wanders around looking to help others and gain more powers. His young nephew Raflo is folowing steadfastly in Ralfo's footsteps as an adventurer.
