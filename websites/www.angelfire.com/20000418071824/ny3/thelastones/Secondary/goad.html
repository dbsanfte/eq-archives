Goad was but a small tad trollie growing up in the Innothule swamps. Him and his friend
Gazkum(Izlaaru) had much fun barshing frogloks and kobolds to their hearts content, until
a friend, Kadelplexel invited him to join a much larger community called &quot;The Last
Ones&quot;. It opened up the whole world of Norath to him, and Goad soon began to wander,
making new friends, and discovering all manner of strange lands. Kadelplexel soon vanished
from the face of Norath, never to be heard from again, and so a meeting of TLO Knights was
called, and Ralfo proudly assumed the role of Guild Leader, he built a beautiful home for
us knights to call home, and a tavern for us all to gather, drink and be merry in. TLO
prospered, grew, and more friends were made. Goad was growing up now, and yearned for more
events and excitement, so he decides to sponsor TLO's first event and called it the
Ogre/Troll Bash O Rama. Word was passed throughout the lands, and upon the day of
celebration, many a brave knight attended. Drinks were passed, and knights dueled all the
day long, and into the evening. It was a joyous day in the memory of this troll, and again
TLO prospered as our name and honor was spread across Norath. Again our numbers swelled,
and many more friends were joined. Goad continues to travel across the lands spreading
good cheer, leading brave parties to cleans foul dungeons of evil, and drinking his share
of ogreswill. Again a time of change is upon The Last Ones, for our brave leader Ralfo
tires of the weight of his burden, and requests to retire. Ralfo appoints Goad as the new
leader of TLO, and a joyous day it is. I proudly serve my brothers and sisters, and
promise to diligently guard our house from harm, and lead us into the new millennium with
courage and honor until I too pass the banner of TLO to the next proud knight. And most
important of all, I promise to guard our tavern, and ensure a continual supply of spirits
for all HaaaaZaaaaa !!!</font><font size="2"></p>

&quot;Defender of Justice&quot; awarded to Knights Belledonna, Darkian, Kallie, Bombure,
Carnus, Galivious, Izlaaru, Klithor, and Goad. On the date of Jan 25th, Izlaaru, Klithor,
and Goad answered the call for protection from a vile KSer Dangt in Beholders Gorge from a
rightful camping party of players Belledonna, Darkian, Kallie, Carnus, and Galivious.
These 3 knights gave of their time selflessly to travel to the gorge, defend the rightful
party, and courageously confronted the vile Dangt to cease and desist, and tactfully
petitioned GMs to please appear and defend the rightful party. Although the party members
were the target of the KSer, they are still to be recognized with the Defender of Justice
award for their courage and determination, and also for their participation and tactfully
petitioning the GM on the behalf of justice. I am proud to say, that justice was indeed
bestowed upon the valiant knights of TLO as the GM Cammii appeared, warned Dangt of his
past transgressions, and then before everyone's eyes to behold, she summarily banned Dangt
from Norath. the GM reiterated that it was not tonight's event of KSing that caused Dangt
to be banned, but his transgressions in the past, and for twice warnings against Train
Killing parties Sunday and Monday nights, and to reiterate that KSing is not a bannable
offence, but Train Killing is. Hail and Well Met brave Knights! For your brave deeds this
night, you are all hereby dubbed &quot;Defenders of Justice&quot;!</p>
