         The Greater Faydark is an immense forest. Built on the huge trees
     of that forest is the city of Kelethin, home to Wood Elves and 
     Half-Elves. The Greater Faydark is supposed to be the newbie
     zone for this city, but... we'll discuss that later. To the north
     lies Crushbone, home of the Orcs, bane of the entire continent. 
     Kelethin is a great city. You don't have to
     zone to leave it or enter, and everything is pretty easy to
     find one you get used to it. Just make sure you don't fall off. Once you enter the forest itself, however, things change. This
     zone is both big and confusing. It's foggy, so visibility is low.
     There are no landmarks to tell you where you are.
     And all the trees look the same. If
     you stray too far and suddenly find yourself lost in the forest, 
     the best you can hope to do is wander around until you see a path
     or the city itself. The best place to hunt near Kelethin is straight out from the "Newbie Lift,"
     which is the southernmost lift. You'll go over a hill and then
     see a big flat expanse, with a structure that vaguely resembles
     Stonehenge. This is where you want to be. Orc Pawns (level 2) usually
     carry some item of value on them, so if you see one, get it! However, considering
how many people hunt here, pickings can get pretty slim. The hunting is <b>much</b> better
around Felwithe. Take a few minutes to run over there and have a ball. A bit later (level 4 and up) you can hunt right around Crushbone. This can yield
     some pretty good loot and XP if it isn't crowded. Which brings me 
     to my next point: the people. In terms of hunting, the popular area of the Faydark isn't all that
     great. There is a simple reason for this: it's a zoo. There are <b>so</b>
      many people here. It's incredible. This means that in general there isn't
     much around to kill. But the crowded nature of the zone can have its
     advantages. It's a great meeting place. I would even venture so far
     as to say that it's the most social place on Norrath. This gets on
     some people's nerves, but it has its charms. If you're just looking for a
     place to hang out and chat, this is it. The number of people here has
     another advantage. If you're looking to sell or buy something, there's
     a good chance that <b>someone</b> out there is interested in making a deal. This zone
     is known as the "Faymart" because of its reputation as a marketplace.
         <p>
         <font size="5">Final Verdict</font><p>
              Very easy to get lost here, so be alert for that. A <b>very</b> crowded zone. 
     Hunting isn't too good near Kelethin because of the number of people. If you do want to hunt,
     go to Felwithe, or at higher levels, go to the area around Crushbone. But the number of people means you can
     do just about anything here except for kill stuff.
