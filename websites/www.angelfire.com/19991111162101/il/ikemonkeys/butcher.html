     I was talking to God the other day, and God said, "How is it
that anyone becomes a butcher?"
<p>
     Perplexed, I answered, "Well, God, I dunno.  I would've
thought you would've known."
   <p>
     "No, no," God said, "it seems that whenever someone decides to
become a butcher, or starts moving in that direction, I lose
track of them."
      <p>
     "Isn't that odd," I said.  "Well, I would assume they go to
butcher school or something; but how and when they decide to get
into butchering. . . ."
         <p>
     "Yes," God said thoughtfully.  "Hmmm."
            <p>
     "Do you not keep track of them for a reason?  Like, is it
wrong to eat meat or something?" I asked.
               <p>
     "Oh, don't be silly!" God said.  "Who gives a shit?"

     I was walking in the frozen foods section, past the upright
glass cases that lined the outside of the aisle.
           <p>
     "Hellooooo!  Helloooo there!" I said to the frozen foods.
"Hellooooo in there!  I love you!  You're all so sweet and frozen!
Hellooooo!"
              <p>
     And such. . . .
                 <p>
       <hr width=75%><p>
     At the back of the store, I saw this FEMALE butcher.  She was
tall -- much taller than me -- and was kind of cute.  She had this
kind of plain, odd face -- not a beautiful face (it wasn't that
odd, either, really) -- but she was very pretty.  Very tall, and
thin.  It was hard to see her body for both her regular store
uniform and her butcher regalia.  She was talking to a short man
that I don't think she really loved across a glass container that
had nothing but ice in it.  I think there were usually lobsters or
something there (I'm not sure).
                  <p>
     "God," I said, "how is it that SHE'S a butcher?  A FEMALE
butcher?"
                                        <p>
     "I don't know, I told you!" God said.  "If I don't know about
butchers in general, how would I know about a FEMALE butcher, or
ANY particular butcher?!"
                                           <p>
     "I'm sorry, God," I said.
                                              <p>
     "Helloooo!  Hellooooo!" God said.  He was using a high voice
very much like the one I use when I say hello to the frozen foods.
                                                 <p>
     "What is it, God?"
                                                    <p>
     "She has very nice legs," God said.  "Buy her flowers."
                                                       <p>

     "But God," I said, blushing, "I don't even KNOW her!"
<p>
     "Don't be so shy!  You need to get out of the house more.  I
should know:  I'm God."
   <p>
     "But God, you don't even know about butchers," I said.
      <p>
     "Tough shit.  Neither do you."
         <p>
     "That's true," I said.  I mean, I really had to agree.
            <p>
     "You love the butch-er," God sang.
               <p>
     "Gahhh-ahhhd," I said, "you're embarrassing me!"
                  <p>
     "Tough shit," he said.  "I'm God."
                     <p>
     "I love you, God," I said.
                        <p>
     "I love you, too."
                           <p>
     "God," I asked, "do you love butchers?"
                              <p>
     "Love 'em?" God said.  "I don't even KNOW 'em!"
                                 <p>
