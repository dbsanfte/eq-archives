<p>A long time ago a young lady decided that she wished to battle against the evils of
Norrath and to protect her hometown of Freeport.&nbsp; She therefore became a monk, one of
the noblest classes, smiled upon by the Gods.&nbsp; Although understanding nothing of the
challenge she had undertaken, she went forth into the world.&nbsp; She bravely fought
against the orcs who threatened her home town.&nbsp; She was not an adventurer until her
good friend explained to her that her role was not simply to protect her hometown, but to
protect all of Norrath as well.&nbsp; And so she travelled across the lands spreading
cheer and reeking havoc.&nbsp; She's made many friends yet only recently did she decide to
join a guild.&nbsp; She heard about The Last Ones and their pride from her sister
Lizzy.&nbsp; She is ready for this challenge and hopes that she will be a true knight in
the spirit of TLO.&nbsp; She has made many friends on her travells who she cares for very
deeply.&nbsp; Yet when she's down on her luck and it seems like nothing is going to get
better she remembers one thing, &quot;She's All That&quot;!</font></p>
