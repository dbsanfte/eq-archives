<b>Character Info: </B>Rykar is a ranger of moderate experience. He wanted to be like his
older brother Ethan who was a well known ranger/mage from the Sword Coast campaigning the
Neverwinter Nights. Rykar journeyed to the lands of Norrath like so many other pilgrims in
search of new places to discover and riches to be had. He found himself in the beginning
lost forever in the Greater Faydark. Orcs everywhere, Rykar drudged his way early on
killing the blue meanies and getting rewarded for his work by his guildmaster Maesyn
Trueshot. He advanced his skills enough that he ventured to the main continent of
Antonica. His first trip to and through Freeport was an arduous journey in and of itself.
Getting lost at each corner, Rykar eventually got himself a guide to lead him around. From
Freeport, Rykar trekked onward to the happiest place on Norrath, Rivervale. From
Rivervale, he based his travels and adventures from there to the rest of the continent
even going as far as Erudin. Life passed by quickly for Rykar till he saw a band of people
who shared his ire for the greedy and wicked of the world. He joined these people in their
cause and he now runs amok all over Norrath with his fervent companions. Still he gets
lost a lot which causes a lot of deaths to those around him. May he someday actually
figure out that a maxxed out sense heading does not make him a guide. <br>
