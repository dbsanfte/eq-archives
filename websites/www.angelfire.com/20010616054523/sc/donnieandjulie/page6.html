<LI>In rose with petals soft as air<br>
I bind for you the tides and fire-<br>
the death that lives within the flower,<br>
oh gladly, love, for you I bear!<br>
                        <p><b>-Kathleen Rain</B> from "Envoi"</LI>


<p><LI>Will his name be Love<br>
And all his talk be crazy?<br>
Or will his name be Death<br>
And his message easy?<br>
            <p><b>-Louis MacNeice</B> from "Prognosis"</LI>

<p><LI>Jackal, we sniff after the survivors of caravans,<br>
We reap bloody crops on war fields.<br>
No meat of any corpse deprives our lean bellies.<br>
Hunger drives us on scented winds.<br>
Stranger, traveler,<br>
peer into our eyes and translate<br>
the horrible barking of ancient dogs<br>
                     <p><b>-Jim Morrison</B></LI>

<p><LI>There is not room for Death,<br>
Nor atom that his might could render void:<br>
Thou-thou art Being and Breath,<br>
And what thou art may never be destroyed.<br>
                        <p><b>-Emily Bronte</B> "Last Lines" </LI>

<p><LI>Would she would make of me a saint,<br>
Or I of her a sinner.<br>
                     <p><b>-William Congreve</B> from "Pious Selinda"</LI>
 
<p><LI>....But dying is a pleasure,<br>
When living is a pain.<br>
                      <p><b>-John Dryden</B> from "Farewell, Ungrateful Traitor"</LI>

<p><LI>Ask me no more where those stars light<br>
That downwards fall in dead of night;<br>
For in your eyes they sit, and there<br>
Fixed become as in their sphere.<br>
                       <p><b>Thomas Carew</B> from "Song"</LI>

<LI>The Cause of Sorrow is the desire of the One to the<br>
 Many, or of the Many to the One. This also is the<br>
 Cause of Joy.<br>
But the desire of one to another is all of sorrow; its<br>
 birth is hunger, and its death satiety.<br>
The desire of the moth for the star at least saves him<br>
 satiety....<br> 
...Be thou more greedy than the shark, more full of<br>
 yearning than the wind among the pines.<br>
The weary pilgrim struggles on; the satiated pilgrim<br>
 stops.
                               <p><b>-Aliester Crowley</B> from "The Book of Lies"</LI>

<p><LI>He who bends to himself a joy<br>
Does the winged life destroy;<br>
But he who kisses the joy as it flies<br>
Lives in eternity's sunrise<br>
                 <p><b>-William Blake</B> "Eternity"</LI>


<p><LI>Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart.<br>
                                             <p><b>-W.B. Yeats</B> from "Easter 1916"</LI>


<p><LI>I slept with Faith, and found a corpse in my<br>
arms on awaking; I drank and danced all night<br>
with Doubt, and found her a virgin in the morning.<br>
                            <p><b>-Aleister Crowley</B> "Chinese Music"</LI>

<p><LI>Yes! In the sea of life enisled,<br>
With echoing straits between us thrown,<br>
Dotting the shoreless watery wild,<br>
We mortal millions live alone.<br>
                       <p><b>Mathew Arnold</B> "To Marguerite"</LI>

<p><LI>Then let wrath remove;<br>
Love will do the deed;<br>
............For with love<br>
Stony hearts will bleed.<br>
                  <p><b>-George Herbert</B> "Discipline"</LI>

<p><LI>If the doors of perception were cleansed every<br>
thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.<br>
For man has closed himself up, till he sees all<br>
things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.<br>
                         <p><b>Jacob Boehme</B> from "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell"</LI></TD>
