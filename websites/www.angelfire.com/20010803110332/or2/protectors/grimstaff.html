<TD>INFORMATION: Raised in Felwithe, Grimstaff apparently suffered head trauma shortly before beginning his journeys in the world, for he was completely unaware of his surroundings and the layout of this 
fair city.  In time, after slaying hundreds of pests in the nearby wood and travelling about with his good friend Gillit the Gnomish Enchanter, Grimstaff has grown to be a competent wizard.  Now he travels the world 
with the Protectors of the Five, slaughtering the minions of darkness and protecting the virtues we all hold dear.  Grimstaff has most recently been in quest of the fabled Ice Comet for some payback to the creatures
who terrorized him and his friends when he was young, and has become a planeswalker.  Soon, he will wreak his terrible vengeance.</TD>
