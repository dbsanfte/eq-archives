         The Oasis of Marr is the center section of the Desert of Ro
     on Antonica's southeastern coast. It's relatively plain, with
     only one major geographical feature. That feature is an oasis
     in the middle of the zone, and in the middle of that is a temple
     on an island. The entire temple area is haunted by deadly spectres.
     This is one of the most dangerous zones in this part of the world.
     This is because almost all of the monsters in the zone 1) wander and
     2) are aggressive. And when these monsters are things like Sand Giants
     and spectres... it's not too much fun. Therefore, I would <b>not</B> recommend visiting this zone until you are at least level 12 and grouped. After that,
     however, things get better. The best place to hunt is along the eastern
     side, near the water. Here, there aren't too many wandering monsters,
     just crocs and caimans, and they aren't aggressive. This is where
     a lot of high-level newbie groups come to hunt. If you are
     planning on doing any hunting here, this is where I would do it.
     An alternative to this would be just to the north of the lake (around 400, 800) in an area known as the Orc Highway. Many Orc Warriors and Priests wander by, and there are often
     2 or more groups hunting around here if you need help. This is a great place for steady, good EXP at mid-teens.
     Hunting in this zone solo is pretty much just an interesting form of 
     suicide. You are all alone in a big, empty desert, with no one to help 
     you if you get jumped by a nasty, of which there are many. A constant danger here
     are the spectres and Sand Giants. Inevitably, some doofus tries to take on the specs
     and winds up dead. The specs then begin to wander around, usually passing the Orc Highway,
     which means instant death for 12 or so people gathered there. They then pass by the crowded
     docks, killing many there too. Your only defense against these horrors is getting well out of the
     way when someone /shouts "Spec to docks" or something like that. Sand Giants tend to do the
     same, although they don't wander as much.
         <p>
         <font size="5">Final Verdict</font><p>
         A very dangerous zone because of wandering, aggressive, powerful monsters.
     Do <b>not</B> come here until you have a good group and are level 12. Do
     <b>not</B> hunt solo. Instead, hunt crocs along the coast or head the Highway.         <p>
