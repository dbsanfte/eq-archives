Hello, welcome to the NA overview section. This is the place to come to learn about our so-called guild and possibly be brainwashed into joining (okay, well, maybe not the first bit).  Anyways, our guild, the Norrath Alliance, is a general PK/Powergamer/Scammer/Whatever guild in that RPG game we have all grown to love, Evequest.  We're not a real strict guild, and our ONLY requirement is that you play EQ and you enjoy playing EQ.  (damn, thats 2, oh well)
<p>
If you would like to join NA, just go click on the button conviniantly placed on the left hand side of your screen called "join". That is where you can fill out an application.  You should then hopefully be contacted in the next few days, and if yer not, then ICQ either Yen or Rave and tell them to get their "arses" in line.  After that, you're officially in the guild.  We might devise a ranking system or whatever as soon as we feel we need one, but for now, we have none whatsoever.  (I guess thats a hint for someone to make one up or somthing)
<p>
One thing that makes us SpEcIaL is that we are (or at least try to be) masters at the art of scamming.  In UO, we used every possible tactic we could to part people with their money. And, oh yes, it worked very well.  Plus it was fun, so that kinda worked out nicely. = )
<p>
Feel free to do whatever you like in NA.  You can random PK, you can roleplay, you can sit by the bank and whack-off if you want.  We might all just end up standing around rasing our fishing skill for all I know. That brings up another good point.  I don't know exactly how EQ is going to work, but we ARE going to try to PK and steal and all that good stuff.  We might end up becomeing hard core "duelists" if no one else plays with the PvP switch on.  Well, i'm just saying that whatever EQ is going to be like, we're going to have a bitchin' time playing it.  HARDCORE!
<p>
Also, don't expect to see much action out of the guild until phase 4 heats up.  I don't think any of us were blessed enough to partake in phase 3.  We might start haveing guild meetings sometime soon, depending on what everyone wants.
<p>
Stay tuned for more guild changes and updates. Who knows when all of a sudden we might turn into a "Conservative Pro-PBS Union".  = )
