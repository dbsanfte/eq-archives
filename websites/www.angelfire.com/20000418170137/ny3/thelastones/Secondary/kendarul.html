'The path of darkness has blindly led me to you, the Last Ones.' -Kendarul <br>
<br>
<br>
Though my lot has been thrown in with you lightdwellers, it does not make me a
lightdweller. I am a victim of circumstance. Banished from those who followed me, I met
the shaman Bloodsworn who took me under his wing. He attempted to show me compassion and
temperance and I took his teachings with feigned interest and mock understanding. <br>
<br>
Know that I do not believe in nobility, humility or mercy. There is only absolute power
forged by the hatred of Innoruuk and tempered by my indomitable will. <br>
<br>
Still, the Last Ones took me, an outcast in the eyes of former allies and friends, and
made me part of your family. It is this distasteful kindness that holds me within the
boundaries of civility. <br>
<br>
Though I may wander the lands of Norrath alone, as it should be, I will aid any Last One
as long as it does not interfere with my ultimate goal...a goal that is mine alone to
know. <br>
<br>
Tread carefully in the eyes of Innoruuk for he knows no forgiveness... </font><font size="2"></p>
