<font size="5">Successfully pulled Bloodeye</font>
<p>
 Bloodeye was one of my most successful pulls ever.  I pulled this nasty named Trakanon when I was at lvl 39.  This NPC was rough because it was around lvl 50, and was faster than me even though I had a snare on it, and a SOW cast upon myself.  The bard, to my right is Wolfrydr and the werewolf is Vanissa an Enchantess, both are officers of the Holistic Crusaders.<p>

<p>
What is it that the Holistic Crusaders do you might ask? <br>
Answer: We kill Undead
<br>
Here is a pic of a Iksar Ghost that we killed in the Tranktons Teeth.  Oi' Ar' but this spook hit me with a very nasty Direct Dammage Spell when I pulled him. But since the Holistic Crusaders Specialize in Killing the undead he was not a problem.
