Okay, I'll admit it, this site is almost as bad as stoffer's whore (oops, didn't mean to say that =P).  That should change in a few days now (it better), because the final, as you know, will be coming out tommorrow. Now being the highlords of this guild, we have decided to base this guild on the <b>Xegony</b> server. All the old UO-GL hacks will be on that one (including kreiger (rehehehe >=) )). I'll start a character list with names/races/classes and such tommorrow.  I'll be the wood-elf druid named Yenly, Rave is most likely going to be a high-elf enchater named Aanika (she's hot, too), Portlis is going to be a wood-elf ranger named Diddle, Fallen is most likely gonna be a Human Necro named Nekkron, and Scottly  will be a wood-elf bard (named ??)
<p>
Also, I dug up a cool find while surfing around eBay.  Someone is selling their old UO account with a whole bunch of cash for around $2000 in real money. Yes, thats $2000 in real money. Yes, thats $2000 in real money. Go <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=75868384" target="_blank">here</a> to check it out.  Also, I found a cool <a href="http://con.xrgn.com/CharStats/vision2.htm" target="_blank">pic</a> comparing the nightvision capabilites of all the races. Thats all for now, stay cool.

<p>
In other EQ news, I finally made level 9. Okay, now for the real news. In case you haven't heard, the Vault Networks prez Eric Neuman pissed a whole bunch of people off a few days ago by dissing every other EQ fan site out there.  Go here to get the whole scoop.  Hehe, really now, go <a href="http://www.planetcrap.com/919596798/">here</a> to find out more. Keep on hacking everyone, less than 3 weeks 'till the final release.  = )

Long-time-no-post from the Yen Foo for a while because of the fact that I've been a little sick (not to mention OBSSESED with EQ). I just got some info in that they won't have the guild system up for a while (bummer), but it should most likely be in by the end of the beta.
<p>
Along the lines of everquest, I have had a helluva time playing it.  Currently, I have a level 7 monk on the xegony server, so if anyone else plays on it, we should get together andf kill some stuff (message Yenly in-game).  I guess xegony will be the NA server for the beta, but this can always change for the final release. I should get around to posting some sweet screenshots up today. If anyone has any you want me to post, feel free to send em' over.

Well, we have played EQ for the very first time.  I didn't fully experience the thrill of BEING IN CONTROL, cause I'm waiting on my video card...so I had to watch Yenly play.  He started as a Monk named Yenly, on the PVP server, and to my knowlege he switched because its just bunch of newbie PKs--similar to a newbie war in test center in UO...
<p>
From what I saw, it was really cool.  The magic is incredibly stunning.  The sound and visual effects are amazing.  Yen will probably post later about what is actually like to PLAY it...hehe.
<p>
I expect that I'll be able to play by Sunday, when my video card comes.  I'll start on the server Yenly is on...I'm not sure what one it is right now....and I'll probably be an Erudite Wizard to start out with.

Wow, I've been waiting for this day for 4 months now, and it hasn't came all too soon.  My first char is most likely going to be either a monk or paladin named "Yenly", so if anyone see's me getting beasted by a snake, pass a heal my way.  = )

Okay, we ARE going to have a meeting this Thursday (the 11th) at 8PM central (9PM eastern).  It will be on IRC, in the dalnet channel #norrathalliance.  Again, if you don't kno what IRC is, just ICQ Yen, Rave, or Fallen Lord.  (damn, I feel like I'm repeating myself here) Anyways, some issues that I think we should discuss are:
<p>
<blockquote>
1) Guild Ranking System - What are we doing? Neverquest still there?
<br>
2) Guild hall -  Location, size, funding, etc.
<br>
3) City we are based out of - Are we going to have one?
<br>
4) Any other aspects of EQ you want to discuss.
<p>
</blockquote>
Again, this meeting is not REQURIED, but if you don't have a valid excuse expected to be swipped down by my level 1 monk which I will be creating tommorrow. = )
<p>
Also, everyone PLZ send me their usernames/pass's for the members only section. I plan to fix it up when I finally get a day with less that 4 hours of homework (english is a bitch). Feel free to check out <a href="http://www.eqvault.net/" target="_blank">EQVault</a> and other news sites, since there has been a lot of news lately.  One rumor I have heard is that it may take up to 48 hours for 989 to send out your EQ account registration (up in <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/noflash/index_h.html" target="_blank">everquest.com</a>'s new <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/noflash/index_h.html" target="_blank">phase 4 section</a>).  Now rember this is only a rumor. It will probably take only 10 minutes for the mail to get here after you fill out the account form, but thats what the FAQ says. I'll try to keep everyone updated on this, so stay tuned.  
<p>
And I would just like everyone to have a KICKASS first day in EQ tommorrow. = )

It amazes me how fast (yes, thats fast) this phase 4 beta is creeping up on us.  It just hit me that we are less than a week away before I get to sit down and log in.  And it also suprises me at how large of a guild we have already. That's why I think we should have a guild meeting.  Yes, I know, the subject has donned on me a couple hundred times before, but this time I mean it. Seriously. (Why are you laughing?) 
<p>
Oh well, enough of me dissing myself here. I say that we have a meeting this friday at 7:00 on IRC (I may not be able to come, but we are still having it).  It would be on channel #norrathalliance on DalNet.  If you have no clue what in the world IRC is, just talk to me or fallen lord, and we can get you up and running. This should be an informal meeting, kind of a chance for everyone to get to know everyone else and such. Attendance is not required, just highly recommended. Hope to see ya there.  = )

In case you haven't heard, Redeye (989's new name) has decided to make a PvP+ server for trigger-happy fools like us.  I'm glad to see all the talk about PvPing, because I think the lack of PvP structure was what UO lacked (and eventually led to its downfall).  
<p>
Also, I've been working the bugs out of the new poll script, and I should be getting it put up in a few days now.  Also on the "up and coming" list is a members only section, a new board, and maybe a cool flash movie.

Yah, I know, I've been slacking off on the job and haven't updated for over a week now, but that's all because I'm still upset with the viking's loss. *sigh* Anyways, I've been researching some hosting sites in the past week, and found a really good FREE one that also supports CGI (somthing that lets you make message boards and polls and junk) so I might be incorperating some cool stuff into the page sometime soon.  Also, today is the last day to sign up for phase 4, so get those apps in soon.
<p>
On a side note, I bought a new serial PCI card last week so I can now upload pics from my camera to my computer. Check the gallery section for those.

Well, in case you haven't heard, phase 4 beta mails are being sent out. Everyone BUT me has gotten theirs. Anyways, here is what it says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color=AAAAAA>
The day has finally arrived -- it's time to sign up for the fourth phase of the EverQuest Beta Test. We appreciate your patience as we've worked hard to get the game ready for this monumental event. Phase 4 will begin on February 10th,1999 and will be the final testing phase prior to commercial release. To receive your phase 4 CD in the mail, you will need to sign up for the beta at the following site: www.station.sony.com/everquest/beta 
<p>
A valid credit card is required at sign up, and a fee of US$4.95 will be charged to your account to cover shipping and handling costs. Also, this page will ask you for a unique authorization code (appended to the bottom of this email). Unfortunately, due to timing constraints, this offer is only available to residents of the United States and Canada. 
<p>
Please be aware that we aren't able to control exactly when you will get your CD. This could affect how long you will be playing. Also, realize this is a BETA, which means the game will have bugs and unforeseen problems (which is the whole point of conducting this test!). The purpose is to identify and fix problems before EverQuest is released. 
<p>
Lastly, we make no guarantees that it will work with your system configuration. 
<p>
All of us on the EverQuest development team look forward to seeing you in-game, 
<p>
EverQuest Team

I'm glad to announce that I'm back after a long and greuling trial.  I (along with fallen lord) had a MAJOR chemsitry project that was due yesterday, and that has consumed all my time recently (that and watching oprah).  "Why the HELL didn't you work on it earlier?" you may ask.  Well, I have no frickin' clue, maybe I just like to focus on imprtant, short-term goals, or maybe I am just a looser.  Who knows?
<p>
Well, along the lines of relevant EQ info (but who wants to hear about this stuff when they can hear me whine?), there was a cool PK event where everyone made new PvP+ leval 1 chars and all proceeded to beat on all the other players.  Sounded sweeet.  Also, we have decided to have our guild meetings on the Dal-Net IRC channel #norrathalliance.  Fallen Lord (the IRC whiz) set it up and will gladly make anyone in the guild an auto-op (only if you know what an auto-op is though). If you have no clue as to what IRC is, just talk to me or fallen and we'll hook ya up.  And if yer in need of a client, go <a href="http://webzone.dal.net/" target="_blank">here</a> and figure it out. We should hopefully be having a meeting sometime in the next week or so, depending on when everyone is available.

Well, I know the topic has come up before, but I think we should seriously have a guild meeting sometime soon. Either ICQ or IRC would be cool with me. I would like to go with IRC, since I think its a little better and cooler, but not everyone may know how to use it. Respond at <a href="http://www.luminet.net/~jdthimme/wwwboard/wwwboard.html">DA BOARD</a> if you don't know what the hell IRC is, and I can give you a quick in-tro-duc-tion to it. Also, there was some info on how to form a guild in EQ. Here is the official release:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color=AAAAAA>
<p>
In order to form a guild the following process must be followed:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The leader of the guild must email Eqguilds@sonyinteractive.com. The header of the email must contain the NAME of the guild. In this email the leader will include a short Charter that includes the guild's role in Norrath. In addition, the leader needs to list at least 9 other characters that have agreed to form this guild.
<li>The leader and 9 other players need to email Eqguilds@sonyinteractive.com with the NAME of the guild as the header. The body of this email must include the name of the character that will be joining the guild and the ACCOUNT on which that character exists.
<li>Once the 10 prospective members (including the leader) have completed the above steps, the charter and name of the guild will be reviewed by 989. If both are approved, the leader of the guild will be notified of approval via email and told to approach a GM for formation of the guild. If 989 has any reservations about either the name or the charter, the guild leader will receive an email listing these concerns and be offered an opportunity to modify the charter or name as required.
</ol>

Wow, 989 has actually had the guts enough to release the FINAL release date (yeah, right) as being March 16th, 1999, and the phase 4 beta starting somtime in early-mid Febuary.  Arg.  Here is the offical post by Brad:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color=AAAAAA>
We are finally able to announce some dates! Most of the announcements will go out tomorrow, but I had the chance to post them here tonight, and I know people have been waiting a long time, so here goes:
<p>
EverQuest will be released on March 16, 1999.
<p>
Phase 4 testing will begin early-mid February (I'll hopefully have a more precise date soon, but it should be some time between the 1st and 15th).
<p>
We will be sending out an email to all registered beta testers (yes, the one we had hoped to send out in early December) explaining how and where to sign up for Phase 4 next week. This will include pricing. 
<p>
So there you have it. So far the beta test has been a huge success, and we appreciate both those who have participated, and patience of those who could not, who have been waiting.
<p>
Phase 4 is around the corner, and the release of the game around the next. It's a very exciting time for us, but at the same time there's still a lot of work to be done, and I and the team will deliver the game you all have been waiting for shortly. 
<p>
Thanks for your continued interest and faith in the game and the development team behind it.

According to my source (<a href="http://www.everquestnews.com/cgi-shl/menumgr/menumgr.pl?type=lite&name=EQNIndex.html" target="_blank">EQNN</a>), this phase 4 will very likely happen somtime Jan. 15-18.  Remeber, this is just a rumor (yet another one, we've deal with 'em in the past), so phase 4 could start earlier, but most likely later.  = (
<p>
Also, I would like to give my regrets to Mydrall/Stoney/Fallen-Lord for his recent troubles with his parents.  As you may have heard, his parents are going to cancel his UO account tonight for his recent "slip-up" with his grades...  Oh well, I guess that just means I won't be the ONLY one posting on this page.  = )

What's up everybody?  I've been sick this past week with bronchitis.  It sucks, all I can do is sit at my computer and waste time (not a big change). Well, anyways, that gave me the chance to update this page a bit.  Speaking of the page, head on over to the <a href="members.html">member's section</a> and add everyone to your ICQ list that isn't already on it. There's a lot of em there. Also, while I was sick I also got ICQ99a, the new ICQ version still in alpha testing which you can get <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/Resort/1048/icq99a.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  Its different, but a lot cooler. I wouldn't recommend it, though, unless you want to spend some time re-configuring your whole list.  It took me a few hours to get everyhting set up and become familiar with all the options, but thats just me. = ) 
<p>
Anyways, stay cool 'till EQ, I might be organizing a guild meeting some time soon. = 0

Well, not much happening in da EQ world (but hey, whats new?), so I've decided to babble about something else just as worthless. For christmas I got a new discman and F-Zero X for my N64 (a great game BTW).

Wow, I have been marvelously graced by the EQ gods. Yesterday, I met a cool guy in UO who gave me his EQ account name and pass. Ya dawg... And since I had EQ already installed (previously downloaded) on my computa, I loaded it up and started to hack the game of my dreams (well, okay, maybe not, but anyways....) . It was an enlightening experience to say the least.  Except for the fact that my video card SUX and everything looked like building blocks because of my lack of textures, I had a really great time walking around and trying to figure out what the hell I was doing.  It's a way different style of play than UO, but I think I'll grow to love it. = )
<p>
Also, I am considering getting my own domain name at <a href="http://www.amhosting.com" target="_blank">American Hosting</a>.  They allow UNLIMITED space, ULIMITED bandwidth, and a whole bunch of other options for only 13$ a month. Sweetness. 
<p>
No real EQ news yet, but I'll try and keep this page updated with any WORTHWHILE news. Heh, stay cool, keep on hacking. = )

Hey hey hey, Yenly here, just thought I'd post to make it look like I'm not slacking off. = ) Anyways, a new patch went in today (heh, not that any of us would know), but in it were a few minor fixes along with a major PKing chage:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color=AAAAAA>
There is now a level difference cap of four levels to Pkill, meaning that a level 20 PK character CANNOT attack a level 15 PK character (and vice-versa), but the level 20 PK char. can attack a level 16 PK char. 
<br>
There is also a Pkill loot limit of ONE (1) NON-CONTAINER item of the looters choice, so no more looting all the guy's stuff, and you cannot take any containers or anything in the containers.
<Br>
Pkill characters can now group with Non-Pkill characters and share experience, but they cannot cast any spells on each other, including beneficial spells.
</blockquote></font>
<p>
That kinda sux, but I knew that EQ wouldn't be that great of a game for PKs. Killing monsters is alright, tho, as long as I get to kill everyone I LEGALLY can. = ) &nbsp; In other EQ news, <a href="http://pc.ign.com/previews/2252.html" target="_blank">PC.IGN</a> updated their preview (yet again). I haven't read this one because, frankly, I would rather not get all hyped up on EQ only to the realize that we still have 2 months untill its released. 'weed. 
<p>
Also, in case you haven't heard, 2 phase 3 beta testers were recently banned for exploiting a bug. That should teach us all a very important lesson: Don't get caught.

Sorry for the lack of news in the past couple days. There wasn't anything worthwhile anyways. But I've been making a few minor updates to the page, and am currently trying to find a cheap CGI server to play around with.  I also made a makeshift <a href="guilds.html">guild section</a> in 5 minutes one day. I found this cool <a href="http://www.eqvault.net/features/top10/25.shtml" target="_blank">Top 10 list</a> on "The Top 10 Signs Your Guild Might not be the Best".  Pretty funny.  
<p>
Okay, now for the bad news. <a href="http://www.989studios.com/index_studios.html">989</a> has UNOFFICIALLY moved the EQ release date back to March 4th, 1999. *wimper*  Ya knew it had to happen folks. But hey, on a good note, phase 4 is only a little bit away. (Yeah, after they pushed back the release date a month and a half...) "Hoid"  = (

Wow...its been a long time since I posted any news.  Well, I was gone for a week in Mexico, and then I got sick right as I got home--and I'm still sick.  Our guild has just gotten smaller...something unexpected has come up and Sinoble/Loften/Prettz (all one person) will not be able to play EQ so he can't be in da guild.  Also, I want to again state that N\A has no affiliation with WKoN or BKoN.  The alliance of these two guilds is NOT the "Norrath Alliance".  The Norrath Alliance is seperate, an alliance of PKers and scammers in ONE guild--N\A.  Hope this clears up the confusion...

We are 2 completely seperate guilds, and I have no clue why anyone would think this. Oh well, whatever.  Anyways, in EQ news, EQvault has posted their <a href="http://www.eqvault.net/guidebook/" target="_blank">Guidebook to Norrath</a>.  It gives somewhat in-depth coverage of EQ so-far. Also, there are a whole bunch of worthless previews out there that you can visit and hear all about EQ and how cool it is to play it. I tend not to read these because of the fact that I get all psyched to play EQ and then I get "all depressed" when I realize that we still have ~1 month before we get in the beta. *whimpers*  = (

I stumbled upon a good Voodoo2 vs. TNT debate <a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/VD2vs.TNT.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  It clearly shows that a TNT is a better card in EQ (which is the one I'm getting BTW).

We have now officially switched to board over to Maraxus' CGI server. The old board can be found <a href="http://www.cgiforme.com/cgibin/NAHighLords/wwwboard.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  Not much happenin' in the EQ world.  I got a cool link today from my brother (nigel) to this cool UO site called <a href="http://www.locknload.net/jov/" target="_blank">The Joy of Villanry</a>. It's a really sweet site.  Maraxus is thinking of taking up a site just like it of his own. (which I think is a great idea)
<p>
I was reading some posts today, and it turns out that less than 10% of the testers in phase 3 are PvP+, and some even say that that number might go down. Also, I've heard rumors that the clothing is pretty bad and currently everone looks the same.  Bummer.  = (   I have also heard that the world is HUGE (like up to 4 times as big as UO's), and without a teleport spell, its going to be really hard to stick around with your buds. Another bummer. = ( I hope I won't be dissapointed with EQ, because it would suck to have invested all this time in this page for nothing. 
<p>
On another note, go out and promote PKing at some message boards. Act mature, show everyone that there are some nice and decent PKs.  I LOVE posting about PKing in EQ, and then have some looser respond with "PKers better start killing family members since there is no room for it in EQ".  Ahh, I just love the smell of a freshly flamed looser in the morning. = )

Yes, the rumor is true.  It seems that my network card tried to take my video card's settings, then my video card bumped over onto my modems settings and so on...  Thats when I found out that I was in some serious $#!+ and had to reformat my HD.  Bummer.  = (

Dear EverQuest Beta applicant,
<p>
This letter is to inform you that you have been selected
to participate in EverQuest's phase 4 beta testing. It also
serves as confirmation of your entry in the EQ database.

Shortly we will be ready for Phase 4 testing. Expect another
email which will outline the details of your participation.

Sweet, the <a href="http://www.cgiforme.com/cgibin/NAHighLords/wwwboard.html">message board</a> is back up, so everyone (all 7 of us) can happily post away.  Rave left today on a family vaction to Florida, and he should be back sometime on Sunday. Also, I forgot to mention some new members who join last night.  They are <a href="memchass.html">Chassagar</a>, <a href="memportlis.html">Portlis</a>, and <a href="memvorath.html">Vorath</a>.  Thanx for joining you guys, and try to recruit some more people if you want.  That's about it, keep checking your mail for any sign of phase 4 beta mails. = )

Yes, the <a href="http://www.cgiforme.com/cgibin/NAHighLords/wwwboard.html">message board</a> is down, and I have no clue as to when it will be put up. Also, all members should think of a bio that will be added to their personal info page under the <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/in/norrathalliance/members.html">members</a> section.  This bio can be anything you want, included pictures and links, or anything else that you feel fit. Please ICQ/Email it to <a href="MAILTO:NAHighLords@email.com">ME (Yen)</a> or <a href="MAILTO:NAHighLords@email.com">Rave</a>.

Congrats to Jesse "The Body" Ventura, Governor elect for Minnesota.  All I can say is "wow"...I thought it would be really cool if he won, but I didn't expect him to.  The former pro-wrestler and Navy SEAL pulled off one of the biggest political upsets in history...he was behind in the polls the whole way...even up to the election.  Read up on it...it'll be in any National Newspaper!
<p>
Yesterday someone made a fake post--go to the message board for more info.  I don't want this site turning into a stupid and immature site.  I want to keep this professional, and when people make fake posts I get a bit mad.  Its not even because it was faked to look like it was from a High Lord...I am against any post that is faked to look like it was from anyone who is a member of N\A.  It's about fun, but lets be mature and professional about this...its our responsiblity.

As a highlord of N\A, I would now like to introduce <a href="memred.html">Red Jewelz</a> to the rest of the guild.  He will be a part of the dishonorable faction, and I'm looking forward to playing EQ with him.  Also, I need everyone to write a bio about themselves (1st or 3rd person, anything is fine) to add to the members section.
<p>
In case you haven't heard, the official release date for EQ is January 26, 1999.  Also, the phase 4 beta should be starting in early December.  E-mails will be send out early next week.  Plus, there will be a small shipping/handeling fee associated with that. = (  &nbsp;&nbsp; Oh well, it'll be worth it (it sure as hell better!).

I just got done promoting NA at a few good EQ sites. There are more out there than I thought.  Anyways, finals week is coming up in school and I'm gonna have a bunch of projects due soon so I won't be as focused on the page as much as usual. On a better note, I had a kick@$$ halloween last night.  I went with a bunch of buds to go see a bunch of "nerdy" local ska bands (hey, it was a helluva lot better than you think). <a href="http://www.flypside.com" target="_blank">Flipsyde</a>, a neato local band, was there too. Also, Indros has officially changed his name to "Raven Cawthornn" (really cool) and mStoffer has changed his to "Fallen Lord" (really cool too). Rave found a sweet pic today, check it out by clicking <a href="http://www.eqvault.net/features/top10/top10pics2/Eq0000985.JPG" target="_blank">here</a>.  Oh well, thats about all for now.  Have a safe drive home. = )

Lots acomplished today... I got the board up, fixed up da site, and added these cool headers to the news section. We were also added to the guild section over at <a href="http://equest.questgate.net/index.html" target="_blank">EvilQuest</a>, a kick ass site devoted to PKs in EQ.  Check it out sometime. = )

Sorry for the lack of news as of late.  I am gonna set up the frame work for a possible future bug page.  Once it is up and running I'm gonna need all your help to supply it with the newest, beastliest exploitz.  Check back for more info closer to the EQ release date.
