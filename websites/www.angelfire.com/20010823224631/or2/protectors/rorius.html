<TD colspan="2">INFORMATION: Rorius's Father was one of the greatest paladins to ever fight for the God of Marr.  He was the prime example of nobility and honour.  His Father fought in many wars with the one time powerful and
evil Ogre empire.  He was one of the leaders of the Hall of Truth and faught for all that was good.  He passed down his Magical sword to his Son Rorius who was told to use it to slay all evil.  Living in Freeport
Rorius begain to understand what was going on with the militia there.  One day he will Go after their leader and kill him in the name of his Father, The God Marr and the 5 that he was to uphold and protect.  His
father however said he must also seek out the 3 holy swords of the Paladin.  Rorius must aquire the Soulfire, Ghoulbane and another that is unknown to him.  he has worked for his ranks but still has much to learn
and a long way to go, all under the guidence of Marr and his Fathers teachings.</TD>
