<p align="left" class="headline"><font size="4" class="headline">Meeting last 
  night and languages</font></p>
<p align="left">Balduk was kind enough to fill me in about what you all talked 
  about at the meeting last night, and I also saw the post on the message board 
  about it. First off, it is impossible for us to buy any kind of real-estate 
  right now, but Verant is working on it. Eventually was should be able to buy 
  a guild house. Of course, for now we need to worry about making enough money 
  so when we are able to, we can. Balduk told me that you all made suggestions 
  of how to make money. Ones he told me were a day where all your loot goes to 
  the guild, hunting and selling rare items, and using trade skills. All of these 
  are ideas. The college will also generate a lot of income once we get it started. 
  If you have any other suggestions, you can e-mail me or put them on the message 
  board.</p>
<p align="left">For now, I want to really get serious about this college. For 
  those of you who don't known about it, I will fill you in on how it works. First, 
  it is ran by our guild. We will name it, and only have it meet on days I will 
  announce on our page, Rathe Rhapsody, and others. Our main purpose will be to 
  teach languages, at least until we think of how to teach other things. I wish 
  our members to be the teachers, but I need to know what languages you all know. 
  Please e-mail me or put the languages you know on the message board. That way 
  I know the languages you know, and can begin to finally arrange the college. 
</p>
<p align="left">I am glad that you guys were able to have the meeting in my absence. 
  I can tell you got quite a bit accomplished and I have some suggestions to mess 
  around with now. See you all in Norrath</p>

<p align="left" class="headline"><font size="4" class="headline">Apologies for 
  absence last night</font></p>
<p>I am sorry about my absence at the meeting last night. Unforeseen problems 
  in real life prevented me from being there. I do hope that Aslan or someone 
  was there and the meeting continued in my absence. To make up this meeting I 
  would like to have a meeting:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><i>When:</i></B><i> Saturday, July 24 11:30 PM EST<br>
    <b>Where:</B> Mermaid's Lure, tents outside of Freeport's gates, and outside 
    Rivervale bank</i></p>

<p>Again, I apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

<hr>
<p><b><i><font size="4">Monday, July 19</font></i></B></p>
<p class="headline">Guild meeting</p>
<p>We have not been able to have a guild meeting in sometime, and I am very anxious 
  to have one. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><b>When: </B>Wednesday, July 21 11:30 PM EST<br>
    <b>Where:</B> Mermaid's Lure, tents outside of Freeport's gates, and outside 
    Rivervale bank</i></p>
</Blockquote>
<p>We will use guild chat (/guildsay for those who don't know) to talk, and <b>I 
  would prefer you to be at one of the three locations on the list.</B> If you 
  wonder what one location would be the best, I would say the tents outside of 
  Freeport. The topics that I wish to discuss will be:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. The college<br>
    2. Rewriting the constitution<br>
    3. Setting up a system of order for out meetings </p>
</Blockquote>
<p>We will talk about as many as we have time for. Usually more topics will be 
  brought up in the meeting and it is one big mess. That is why I wish to establish 
  a system of order for our meetings. I do ask that if you have any ideas to share, 
  that you would refrain from sharing them until I ask for &quot;new business.&quot; 
  I promise I will ask, because your ideas are important to me.</p>
<p>If you cannot make it to the meeting on Wednesday, don't worry. I plan on possibly 
  having another meeting on Saturday very few people show up on Wednesday. Hope 
  to see you all soon.</p>

<p align="left" class="headline">Aslan needs guild's help for quest</p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">As some of you may have noticed I was not online 
  this weekend because I was out of town. I was glad to see that Balduk completed 
  Aslan's quest and would like to congratulate him on completing the task Aslan 
  had for him. I know that Aslan will come up with many more quest (as will other 
  members) for those of you who could not participate. Aslan posted a question 
  on the message board, and I thought I would bring it to your attention (I did 
  a bit of formatting):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="3"><i>Greetings all! A simple pole, and I would like every member 
    to reply to these questions. </i></font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><i>1. Are you interested in doing a guild quest? <br>
    2. If so, what lv are you and what area would you like the quest to be in?<br>
    </i></font><font size="3"><i>3. What reward (coin or item value) would the 
    quest have to yield to be worth it? </i></font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><i>BE HONEST. Also if any want to help run quests by writing 
    them or playing one of the characters, e-mail me. Quick reply's of, &quot;No 
    I do not want the quest,&quot; and, &quot;lv8 Qeynos 5pp,&quot; are acceptable 
    responses, but please all respond.</i></font></p>
</Blockquote>
<p>Also Aslan also posted this announcing Balduks completion of the quest and 
  some more details of his plans:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Brother Balduk Finished the first guild quest last eve, and it went off 
    with quite bang. =) Now I have some very, VERY grand quest ideas in the works 
    but I need two things. First, I need to know if you are interested. Secondly, 
    I need others to aid me (unlike AD&D I can not run all the NPCS by myself). 
    So far I am lucky to have had as a good a friend as Snydar at my side or else 
    I would be unable to get anything done. =) Now I need 9 people interested, 
    at the least, to start a guild quest "thing"(I have no name yet for the idea) 
    and also to take these quests out to the world of Norrath. I think I have 
    some very excellent ideas on how to accomplish this, but I will hold my secrets 
    for those involved. I can not call on Serro to join us he already is overburdened 
    with much work. Now if anyone is interested, <a href="mailto:Fizzban@aol.com">e-mail 
    me</a>. I hope to hear from you. Good travels brothers and safe journeys </i></p>
  <p align="center"><a href="mailto:Fizzban@aol.com">Click here to e-mail Aslan</a></p>
</Blockquote>
<p>I would like to ask as many of you that can to help Aslan. I plan on offering 
  my services. Although this guild is a lot of work, it is a labor of love and 
  a never mind doing it. Aslan and Snydar help me more than they can imagine with 
  the things they do, and I thank them for that. I hope to see you all tonight 
  sometimes.</p>

<p align="left" class="headline">New members and some thoughts</p>
<p align="left">I<b><font size="3">n the last few weeks we have been very busy 
  adding new members. I would like to welcome the following individuals to the 
  Arcane Knights:</font></B></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3">Apolyion<br>

  Lorana</font> </B></p>
<p align="left">As you can see from the list we are beginning to grow at an alarming 
  rate lately. I know that many of you have one question on your mind, &quot;When 
  are we going to have some events?&quot; There is a problem though. When we do 
  start to plan events, or announce events on the page, I see no response from 
  any of you. </p>
<p align="left">I recently ask you to tell me the languages you know for the college, 
  and no one e-mail me or said anything to me in game (except Aslan). </p>
<p align="left">Aslan has a quest he has worked hard to plan, and is having it 
  on Friday. Again, none of you have expressed any interest to him. I have put 
  forms on the page to make it easy for you to communicate with me, and I rarely 
  receive anything.</p>
<p align="left">It is very important that I begin to see some participation from 
  our members. I have a lot of duties and responsibilities that would be made 
  less if I could get some feedback and suggestions!! You are all so cooperative 
  and helpful in game! I need to see some of that out of game too! PLEASE.</p>
<p align="left"> I would like to let you know that I am not mad at anyone, and 
  that I appreciate you all joining the guild. I could never imagine that it would 
  be where it is when I first thought of it one day during BETA testing. </p>
<p align="left">For the first time, this guild has the talent, the will power, 
  and the determination for it to become the grand and magnificent guild that 
  I envisioned. It is time for us to join together as bother and sister and make 
  a name in Norrath that will never be forgotten. </p>
<p align="left">The Arcane Knights is just beginning, and I know it will become 
  a grand guild. My question is, will you play a part in that greatness, or just 
  come along for the ride?</p>

  fishing village in South Ro at the appointed time. Hope to see you there =)</font></p>
<hr>
<p>Here is what Aslan said on the message board:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Greetings all there will be the first quest for guild members this Friday 
    night, and while it is not guild related in story line I wanted to keep it 
    simple the first time through, the reward varies from a ruined totem staff,20-30pp 
    electrum bracelets, jaded rings ect.. ect.. at least two people will be needed

</Blockquote>
<p>Also, I need you all to be sending me strategy guides and things like that 
  for the strategies section. It would be nice if some of our high level people 
  could come up with an updated list of spells for their classes. I could get 
  you an old list, and you would just have to make changes as needed. If any of 
  you are interested in that, <a href="mailto:serro@telebot.com">e-mail me</a> 
  and I will get you the old list. I will be adding a option to &quot;submit info&quot;. 
  That is mainly just for the strategy section and news that you may want me to 
  put on the web page. For quest and applications, use the correct pages. Good 
  luck to you all.</p>

<p align="left">Well, on Friday night we had our first out of game meeting. I 
  need not hear anyone complain, so I assume that everyone liked it that way. 
  At the meeting we discussed several items. The main thing was the starting of 
  a college. There was a slight debate on whether to call it a &quot;college,&quot; 
  or just a &quot;language fair.&quot; Finally we did settle on calling it a college, 
  but it running on donation and not tuition. Now I need all of you who know languages 
  that might come in handy to e-mail me and let me know what they are so I can 
  arrange who will teach what. </p>
<p align="left">We also discussed starting a list that would warn our members 
  of people in Norrath to beware of and avoid. That would be people like kill 
  stealers, thieves, and other evil characters.</p>
<p align="left">I will have more to say on both of these later this week. I am 
  going to be setting Sundays and Wednesdays aside as the days to do major updates, 
  so look forward to seeing new things on those days.</p>
