<font size="5">Introduction to Raid Leadership by: 
Maladamuk Heartmender</font>


   <p>

Zephyran and I were speaking one day and he mentioned that he (and several others) were interested in learning how to lead events but didn't really know where to start - and that some kind of beginning guide would be useful. I think Neferti's Raid Guide is a disaster -- I try to avoid profanity in general so "STFU" isn't the most helpful motto in my book of leadership. So it's time to generate an alternative, and so I have a series of threads in mind to assist with that.   <p>

<u>Leadership Volume I:</u> Raid Planning. This covers ideas for what makes a good raid, how to "sell" your event, and some of the essentials to think about before you even show up on raid day.  <p>

<u>Leadership Volume II: </u> Group Construction. You've got 24 or more people on your raid - how do you put them into some semblance of groups? This is a good start on how, taking the nature of your target into consideration. <p>

<u>Leadership Volume III: </u> Mid-raid management. This is definitely the most free-flowing chapter because so much of the success of a raid is determined before you even arrive, and how you lead during battle is a question of personal tastes and leadership styles. <p>

<u> Leadership Volume IV: Q&A. </u> This is where YOU ask questions sparked by the first three volumes and point out things that I'm missing. <p>

This is not the only way to run a raid -- there are others, and indeed there are probably better. But these things are an attempt to take the things that I subconsciously and automatically try to do, and put them in an explicit, public forum -- and hopefully share some of the difficulties that I learned by fire before you ever have to.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>

<font size="5">Volume I: Raid Planning </font><p>


<br>
*HIGHLIGHTS*
-- Schedule raids that benefit lots of OTHER people. Make it clear to all involved what the benefits might be.<br>
-- Budget time generously; plan for things that can go wrong and prepare those who attend to invest the time to do a task right.<br>
-- Weekends are precious. Keep small events or short events on weekdays.<br>
-- Don't waste manpower -- allowing a safe margin for error is different from brutal overkill.<br>
-- Be early, get your resources lined up, and do everything you can to prevent a leadership vacuum.<br>
-- If it doesn't work, be patient, but persistent. Raid with other people for awhile, make some observations, have some fun, then try your hand again.<p>

<b>1. I want to lead a raid. What should it be? Well, you'll probably choose something that's one of four things:</B><br>
-- A raid of direct benefit to everyone (or at least a large part of the population -- ie "open" raids)
-- A raid for fun (emphasis on social interaction)<br>
-- A raid on someone else's behalf<br>
-- A raid of importance to you (epics or big-ticket gear come to mind)<br>
I do my best never to schedule raids that fall solely in the last category. Raiding your own behalf *always* encourages all who attend to wonder how they can benefit from the same kind of attention. What starts as one person's quest becomes 20 or 30 people looking to do things of similar heft and personal benefit. And they expect YOU to attend, because they helped you, and they expect the OTHERS to attend, otherwise it's favoritism. And thus we find ourselves in the epic trap, fatigued and lifeless. That's no fun. <br>Furthermore, if you fail (tpw, item doesn't drop, mob isn't up), you get disappointed and frustrated, AND you start wondering when you can drag everybody out for the exact same event in the future. Everyone else begins thinking, uggghhh...
<p>
The first two kinds of raids are *much* better for starting out on. While people come to planes raids with high expectations, they also do so aware of the risks and of the fact that at least half the people in attendance will benefit. "Fun" raids are vastly underutilized and always, always, always EXPAND your leadership skills while making people more willing to raid in the future. The classic, low-speed example of this is the language fair, with secondaries raids being a step up in difficulty, and then greenie mashings (ie Mistmoore or Splitpaw as a 50+ raid) being the next step up. Planes and dragon raids, while difficult to conduct at the time and very risky, are almost always guaranteed good attendance, and are excellent training before you start looking at even bigger targets.
<p>
Raiding on other peoples' behalf is easiest to do when the person(s) in question are quiet, loyal contributors who simply are too modest to schedule raids on their own behalf. They're used sparingly and can still contribute to event fatigue more than "fun" raids or "open" raids, but honestly, without them, some of our greatest troopers would go unrewarded.
<p>
<b>2. So, I know what I want to do. When should I schedule it?</B><br>
I like to schedule raids for 30-40% longer than they would take if everything were to go right. If the repop on your mobs is 2 hours and you intend to do 3 cycles, it would normally take 4 hours (you arrive and find them up, kill once at hour zero, once at 2, once at 4, raid complete). Now budget time for break-in and a good CR  . Say you're looking at a 6-hour raid. This way if everything goes well, maybe you get an extra cycle... and if everything goes badly, you can still get 2 cycles without everyone panicking and looking at the door.
<p>
Choice of day is related to availability -- both your availability and the presence of enough people to make the raid possible. Our older population means evenings are better than daytimes, and weekends are better than weekdays.
<p>
*In general, raids needing 3 groups or fewer, or 5 hours or fewer, should be on weekdays.*
<br>
This way when we've got the bulk of our people available, we aren't scattering them to the winds wasting a 5-group raid on a 2-group target. Remember that events require time for transit, group construction, buffs, corpse recovery, and then transportation back to hunting areas. Some people literally require two hours just for transit if camped at a remote dungeon, and intending to go back there. You can try to convince me that gear, levels, or platinum is our most precious resource, but you miss the point -- TIME is the thing that drives what we can accomplish, and wasted manpower or wasted time does little to advance anyone's goals.
<p>
Never, EVER post a thread asking for "general interest" without specifying a date. People will honestly do anything. ANYTHING. Some things require good salesmanship and others sell themselves, but *nobody* is more likely to come to an event just because you've mentioned it ten times already. If anything, this gives people the impression that you've already tapped the resources of your guild, even when you haven't.
<p>
3. What should I do about level limits? I hate feeling like I'm excluding people.
In EverQuest, levels are GOD. But broader level ranges expand the range of attendance, give everyone a sense of community, and give valuable training to new raiders. What's the balance?
<p>
I try to look at the average difficulty of the target that you will spend the bulk of your time camping. In a raid environment, I set a HARD CAP at 15 levels under the average target strength. Period. Anything under this and even the slightest mistake (sitting on the pull, exposure to the AE, hitting taunt instead of kick) will result in a dead raider. I then start adjusting based on special features of the target, AND on the likely attendance. Zones where the targets are unmezzable, have an AE, are likely to respawn in camp... these all present situations where lower level players are going to be put in more danger and, because of the level-based component of mob aggro, will draw far too much attention to the raid party.
<p>
The top end of the level range is up to you. If you want to banish 50+ players for training purposes, then so be it  .
<p>
4. I scheduled this event, but nobody comes. What's up with that?
Rule number one in marketing: If nobody knows what it's good for, they probably won't buy it.
<p>
Some things have obvious value -- the drops we get in planes, and the chance to slay a dragon, are their own incentive. Getting people to help out with an enchanter epic can be hard -- just a funny-looking snake with some stats, right? A patient enchanter explains the mana-free haste and AC and suddenly raiders are lined up to plunge into Chardok.
<p>
But other than beer and Nike ads, which focus on image, you generally need to show utility in your raid. Again, the utility of planes raids are obvious. Nobody minds hunting in Kael -- getting enough faction not to be slaughtered by Wuoshi is incentive enough. But how in the world do you get people out to City of Mist for a reaver raid, or to the Kael bank for the head of staff sergeant Drioc?
<p>
You do it by creating a need for several factions of people. If you're going to City of Mist, line up some mages and take along a shaman who needs to finish his epic. Now you're getting somewhere -- you've got your friends, the shaman's friends, and probably some monks, int casters and SKs who see that they've got a shot at phatty daddy lewt from the other mobs in the area. Point out that the reavers are pretty MR and that the rogues have a good chance at picking up some nice xp in the course of the night. Next thing you know you've got 4 groups, all acknowledging that there might be something in it for them. If Kael bank is where you need to go, instead of taking a full-fledged raid or asking your Arena raid to divert to the bank "so we can kill this mob for me," come back on your own time with a single group and make it an xp camp.
<p>
*Experience in the course of accomplishing a secondary objective is the single best way to get a group to come help you. EVERYONE gets benefit from experience. If your camp can be done with a single group, take a competent single group where everyone can benefit.*
<p>
5. So you're saying I should kill two birds with one stone? Doesn't that make for a long raid?
Yes, it can. Remember that one long raid means that you only have to provide one set of transportation, build one set of groups, etc... in the end, it's vastly more efficient. ALWAYS, ALWAYS do more than one thing at a time.
<p>
6. People still aren't coming. What's left to do? I really have my sights set on this objective.
I fully believe that no one will be left behind or shortchanged. All that's required is *GENTLE* persistence and TONS of patience. Keep attending other raids and looking for people to partner up with that are likely to help you. The more you are around, the more other people will wonder how they can be of assistance to you. Work hard for other people and I guarantee it will be repaid tenfold, probably when you least expect it.
<p>
7. OK. I have a good signup, folks are pumped, and the raid is in two hours. Anything I need to do?
-- Make sure you have any components you need, especially peridot for clerics and enchanters, pearls for mages, and portal stones for planes. If you can't get these at minimum cost, get a chanter or shaman charisma buff and then shop someplace you have good faction.<br>
-- If it's an exceedingly risky raid, try to have all melees bound close to a portal or close to the raid location, and ask a wizard or druid to bind in the bazaar near the coffin vendor.<br>
-- Get to the raid site early, or have a friend of yours on station early who can answer last-minute questions before you arrive.<br>
-- Do things around the house to limit your AFK time. You never know when something is going to go desperately wrong and you're needed -- and if you're busy doing something you forgot while your raid dies, something has gone very wrong indeed.<br>
-- Make sure you have an alternate leader in place. Linkdeath, power outages, and RL emergencies aren't under your control, but good preplanning can save a raid.<p>

8. Remember, this is a game! We play this in our spare time, and pay for the privilege. Management can be a daunting task but if you're not having fun in the first place, let somebody else take the reins. People should look forward to raiding with you in the future, and creating an atmosphere of misery or oppression is something we can do from 9-5 Monday-Friday  . Don't let this guide fool you into thinking this is anything more than a very challenging, very time-intensive recreation with lots of social interaction.

<font size="5">Raid leadership, Volume II: Group construction</font><p>

The most daunting hour of a raid is the first one -- specifically, half an hour before you start,and the half hour where you're just getting started. This volume on Raid Leadership is designed to walk you through the half hour before a raid, and the delicate art of group construction. Compliments to Deeger on his java program for building groups, which may make my guide obsolete -- even if I keep doing it by hand just for old school's sake  . Like leadership in general, this group-construction roadmap is a matter of taste -- but I think it works pretty well.
<p>
<b>A Philosophy of Two Groups</B><p>

In my mind, 75% of the success of your raid hinges on building only your first two groups. The rest of your group composition is a matter of putting what you have left into a semblance of order. What changes from raid to raid, and from target to target, is what those two groups look like.<p>

<u>--- Conventional raid format</u><br>
The conventional raid format is best suited to places where you want lots of targets coming in to a pair of assists. This setup is not built to handle uber-melee mobs (Ixiblat Fer) or AE mobs (dragons).
<p>
GROUP ONE: PULL TEAM<br>
Puller 1<br>
Puller 2<br>
Cleric 1<br>
Secondary Assist<br>
Druid 2 (or Bard 1)<br>
Shaman 1 (or Enchanter 2 - this person is a designated slower)<br>
<p>
GROUP TWO: <br>
Main Assist <br>
Cleric 2<br>
Enchanter 1<br>
Druid 2<br>
Paladin<br>
Any melee<br>
<p>
Cleric 1 has the hardest job in the raid -- keeping the pullers, the slower, and one of the assists alive. Bards make a good substitute for the assistant healer since they'll keep the cleric in more mana.
<p>
The main mezzer and the slower *should* operate independently -- they are both a form of crowd control ina pinch. Putting them in separate groups lets them run free. I use a secondary healer to protect both of these groups since there is a lot of aggro generated here, and will be some close calls. The paladin is there to assist the mezzer with stuns, roots, and taunts -- not to deal damage. The bonus melee is in group two almost as a landmark, following the MA around and showing the rest of the party where the fight is.<p>

OTHER GROUPS: Build these groups as balanced as you can, with a mix of melees, casters, and especially healers. Try to leave a wizard as leader of a group of 5 so they can handle translocations as the raid goes along.<p>

<u>--- Melee/AE target format</u><br>
This format is designed for single targets with supremely high melee damage and a need to keep aggro focused on one tank (ideally a 55+ warrior for defensive disc). The same format is also used against targets with dangerous AE effects, with the only change being in the way bards are utilized.
<p>
GROUP ONE: TANK TEAM<br>
Enchanter 1<br>
Main Assist<br>
Secondary Assist<br>
Bard 1<br>
Druid 1<br>
Druid 2<br>
<p>
GROUP TWO: HEALER TEAM<br>
Cleric 1<br>
Cleric 2<br>
Cleric 3<br>
Cleric 4 (or Druid 3)<br>
Cleric 5 (or Druid 4)<br>
Bard<br>
<p>
The chanter is in group one to give the tanks their pick of aggro-enhancing spells (usually Trickster or Garou). Their secondary responsibility is as a HEALER, casting Rune. Against melee targets, the bard in group 1 gets right in the thick of things, leading off the battle with haste and then (assuming the target isn't completely resistant) weaves in occlusion of sound or other debuffers. Against AE mobs, the priority is to enhance resists (AE song preferred over group song, if available), then haste, then debuffs. Druids in group one heal only at the very beginning of the fight, then switch to nukage except in situations where the tanks are in grave danger.<p>

Group 2 should have as many clerics as possible. The goal for this group is to have all but one of the healers dedicated to a complete heal rotation, with one healer (still preferably a cleric) casting short "coverage" heals when a CH is going to land late. Against melee-only mobs, the bard can be replaced with yet another healer, or should sing a mana song. Against AE mobs, resists are the priority, with mana songs of very little comparative use. If druids are used, they should cast a few small heals right at the start of the fight, and then conserve mana for nuking or emergency late heals.
<p>
OTHER GROUPS: Conservation of healers is the name of the game. Do NOT waste healers on int casters -- against these mobs, if the casters draw aggro, no healer in the world will be able to keep up. Also, keep in mind that druids are probably needed as nukers rather than healers. Melee groups should include a paladin for emergency heal duty (yes, I'm serious), but if the fight comes down to that, something has gone wrong -- and paladins should be saving their LoH to cover the main or secondary assist, anyhow. Give caster groups a necromancer in a pinch and let them heal. So it wouldn't be unusual to see <p>

GROUP THREE:<p>

Monk 1<br>
Rogue 2<br>
Rogue 3<br>
Shadowknight 2<br>
Paladin 3<br>
Bard 3<br>
<p>
and GROUP FOUR:<br>
Wizard 1<br>
Mage 1<br>
Wizard 2<br>
Enchanter 3<br>
Necromancer 1<br>
Wizard 3<br>
<p>
General tips<br>
At first, try to focus on one key class/role (usually healers) and focus building more-or-less balanced groups around each member of the class that you have in attendance. Use a big sheet of paper and spread out each group so you can scratch out and re-assign people without doing it over again. And perhaps the biggest way to save time is to task someone ELSE to handle groups for the duration of the night if you're the raid leader. After a few raids of building groups yourself you'll become better and confident and can handle the changes that occur as people arrive and depart -- but don't expect yourself to be able to handle it all instantly!<p>

<font size="5">Guide to Raid Leadership, Volume 3: Conduct of a Raid</font><p>

In many ways, once the raid has started, the most difficult tasks are done. Raids essentially are in the hands of the pullers (and, to a lesser extent, the healers and chanters that are keeping people alive). The pace of a raid is set by instructions to the pullers, letting them know how fast and how often to pull, and waiting for their suggestions on when to move from one camp to another.<p>

This changes when things go wrong. And they almost always go wrong, in some way. Let's take a look at each and think about solutions.<p>

<b><u>-- Latecomers</B></u><br>
You need to be clear in advance whether latecomers will be welcome, or whether you're banning them outright. Late arrivals make group adjustments challenging but also help fill spaces freed by departing players -- letting you use different time zones, for instance, to your advantage. I personally welcome latercomers, but usually with a few stipulations.<p>

-- They must ALWAYS check with the raid leader and/or the person monitoring group membership before they arrive. If you would have to completely rebuild the group structure, tell them to wait until a space frees up, or to bring 4-5 others so that they can have a self-contained group. There is almost never a single person that justifies a 20 minute break while you rebuild all the groups on their behalf (the only time I rebuild groups like that is when *I* leave someone out that had reported to the raid on time -- that's my mistake and so it's my problem to fix).<br>
-- They may need to arrange for their own transportation. If this is Fear or Karnor's, this isn't hard. If this is Hate or Dragon Necropolis, this provides its own form of crowd control.<p>

-- If you NEED reinforcements, be proactive. Detach people from your raid to handle transportation, give them an escort, pull a path clear -- do what you need to do to bring them along. A temporary slowdown in the raid is fine if it extends a good raid by several hours. Send people that aren't on the raid a /tell and ask them if they'd like to come.<p>

-- Try to give latecomers a realistic estimate of how much longer you think the raid will last. This is fallible; folks get tired unexpectedly and the show can shut down fast. But a good guess will give all parties a sense of whether it's worth the effort to come on their own.<p>

<b><u>-- Discipline</u></B><br>
It can be loot, aggro management (casting/taunting/attacking too hard/early), verbal abuse, or just a genuine bad attitude... but sometimes people have to be asked to go.<p>

-- Warn them first. Always, always give attendees a chance to fix their behavior. Be sure group leaders keep you abreast of any simmering discipline problems in groups so that things don't go haywire when you're not expecting it.<p>

-- If it's a personality conflict or some form of in-group verbal sparring, have them swap groups with somebody. If you can, put them in YOUR group, which will let you sit on them if they get really out of line. If it's a verbal battle in /tells, have somebody use /ignore.<p>

-- Don't be afraid to ask them to leave if the problem persists. This is a serious thing and should only be exercised if you're out of options on how to subdue the dissenter. Give them a TL if you can or, if things are THAT bad, spare a porter and get them out.
-- If they refuse to leave, have their group leader disband them -- this is easiest to do if they've been moved to your group. Inform them that if they die, they will receive a revive (not necessary an xp rez) at a time and place of your choosing should they die. Inform the clerics via /tell of your situation... there's no need to make a public scene in most cases. If the dissenter makes it public, explain that a) there were multiple warnings/opportunities to correct, b) that transportation out of the raid had been offered and refused, and c) that their continued presence was making the raid unpleasant and dangerous. If they die, they are at least removed from the plane, and then you can rez/revive at the END of the raid, when their presence doesn't affect the raid any longer.
-- The important thing to realize about discipline is that it's a hard line, but that all the attendees have given of their time to attend, and if your troublemaker is making a raid impossibly unpleasant for YOU as the leader, there are many others suffering as well. Your duty as leader is to your raid as a whole, an obligation you accepted when you volunteered to lead. That corporate duty and loyalty can require hard measures; if you're not prepared, then don't lead a raid.<p>

<b><u>-- Wipeouts</B></u><br>
If you get a cleric camped out and someone still alive and feigned in the area, your raid is still in business. All that's required is finding a safe camp site at which to rez -- something your FDer will already be thinking about. Clerics tend to camp in the first open patch of land that appears to be out of aggro radius, which isn't necessarily going to be a safe place when they log back in, so getting them back in and to a safe area is the first priority. Then it's simply a matter of mana and corpse dragging -- things your clerics, rogues, and FDers know plenty about.<p>

Total party wipeout (tpw) can be the most troubling situation of all, as there's often no way around significant downtime. If you're a first-time leader or there's a more experienced person around, I would immediately and explicitly default to their leadership (after you ask them to take things under control!) in time of tpw, and take some notes. Here are some initial guidelines.<p>

-- Get somebody to the area to assess the situation. Rogues are ideal for this but their utility drops drastically if mobs in the area see hide. In any case, where a rogue can go, an FDer can probably follow - so try to get somebody feigned in the area to watch things play out. Do not take unnecessary risks with your rogues and feigners. The last thing you want is to have multiple corpses to summon.<p>

-- Necros allowing, detach a porter (with a decent bank account) to the bazaar to sit and wait by the coffin vendor. If the decision to summon corpses comes, you don't want to have to wait for a Luclin port, or a mule transfer in Neriak. You may also need someone standing by to purchase portal stones if a plane raid has gone bad.<p>

-- Give your groups a realistic estimate of how long you expect recovery to take, and an occasional status update. Warn the people that are going to be the first rezzed to try and limit their afk time.<p>

-- If the following 3 conditions are met, immediately begin setting up a mass corpse summons: You cannot get a feigner or rogue into the area (ie corpse dragging and/or necro rezzes are not an option); there are not sufficient reinforcements available to re-break your camp, and there is a safe spot in zone to which you can summon corpses. When all 3 of these are true, summons is simply the only way to fly. If only the first TWO apply (basically, if you have a failed Fear break-in on hand), then you should start looking for other guilds and friends who would be willing to assist in a recovery.<p>

-- Have all raid attendees consent anyone that might need to drag a corpse right away, so that if they go afk, they don't miss a very narrow window during which they could drag corpses safely.<p>

<u><b><br>-- Loot</B></u></B><br>
Have a loot master set up. Most raids shouldn't have much downtime (ToV and dragon raids are the exception), so you need someone who can focus on loot while you concern yourself with the continued progress of the raid -- thus, a loot master. Make sure that everyone in attendance knows the loot policy and knows who the loot master is, what channels they would use, what eligibility they have, etc. Make it abundantly clear that the loot master has absolute final authority on loot. Once that's done, don't even worry about it anymore, unless you see something that looks blatantly bad going down. Then sort it out via tells, first with the lootmaster, then with any other people involved.<p>

<b><u>-- Ending your raid</u></B><br>
As you see your raid start to lose momentum, make an immediate decision as to how much longer it will go, and stick to it. Obviously mass corpse recovery can ruin any estimate, but giving people a light at the end of the tunnel strikes a good balance between those that are about to pass out, and those that are just getting their second wind or are still in stride. Don't hesitate to end the raid if an absolutely essential, irreplaceable person leaves. There are actually fewer irreplacable people than you might imagine... losing your only 60 warrior probably isn't a death blow if you have another competent tank (of any knight class) standing by, but losing your only enchanter in a plane, or your only remaining wizard in Plane of Hate, is the end of the show. Ditto on running out of mages at City of Mist when you're taking on one of the fire ghosts. Call your raid only when you have absolutely no viable substitutes for the people you're losing. Be sure transportation is clearly arranged before you depart, and do your best to personally be the last person gone.
<p>
If you need to leave but the raid wants to keep trucking, make sure everyone knows who's taking over. Be prepared, however, for the raid to fold up shop when you leave, even with a substitute leader in the wings... after several hours of following YOU, the raid has become inseparably linked to your presence for a lot of people, and this subconscious linkage will suck the momentum out of the event when you leave. Unless you're leaving real early, and this bond hasn't been formed yet, it will take a pretty dedicated crew to stick it out even after you go.
<p>
I think that's it on the conduct of the raid itself... volume 4 will start with a stream-of-consciousness collection of general thoughts on raiding and then wrap up with an opportunity to ask and answer questions.<p>
