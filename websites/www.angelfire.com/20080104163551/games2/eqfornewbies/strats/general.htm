     my life as a newbie. Anything I think is important will go in here. The listing

     <p>
     <a name="#polite"></a><br>
     <li><b>Being polite and what it can get you</b><br>
     In the words of wise master Yoda, "Polite should you be. Nothing would it cost you!"
     Or maybe he didn't say that. I can't remember. Anyway, the saying is true in the land
     of EQ as well. There are a bunch of people out there who will just run up to a Druid
     and say "sow plz." Many people (myself included) consider this the height of rudeness.
     If you want something, you gotta ask nice. Instead of "sow plz" why not try "Would a kind
     Druid be willing to grant a poor traveler a favor and bestow the Spirit of the Wolf
     upon him?" Or something like that. Yeah, it's cheesy, but it gets better results than
     the other way.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#con"></a><br>
     <li><b>Consider</b><br>
     This is an essential thing to do before attacking any mob. It is accomplished by right-clicking the mob or targeting the mob and then pressing the "c" key. The result of this
     action will be something like "MobXXX glares at you, ready to attack - what would
     like your tombstone to say?" The first part of this statement indicates the mob's
     feelings towards you. If it says something like "ready to attack" it will attack you
     on sight. The mob's feelings towards you are determined by your faction; more info
     on that <a href="#faction">here</a>. The second part of the statement indicates the
     mob's level relative to yours. This is also shown by the color of the message. Green,
      easy; Blue, upper hand; White/black, even; yellow, gamble; red, tombstone. In general,
     taking on a yellow or red by yourself <b>will</b> result in you dying. Trust me. That's
     what groups are for. Greens generally
     don't give you any experience, and so aren't worth your time. Blues are usually easy
     to kill, unless the mob has some sort of special ability (poison, spells, etc.). Whites
     are sometimes close calls, but are in general the best things to hunt solo. Consider
     any mob before attacking, and pay attention to what it says - this can save your life any
     number of times.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#corpse"></a><br>
     <li><b>Corpse retrievals</b><br>
     It is inevitable that this will happen to you at least once in your newbie life.
     You will die and end up halfway across the world from your corpse, naked, with 
     no food, water, or money. Or, you might be only a zone away from your corpse, but it
     happens to lie in the middle of an Orc camp. What to do? First of all, you have to accept
     the fact that you can't get it on your own. You will need to turn to your fellow
     players for help. If your situation is the first case (really far away from your corpse),
     you will need to get a teleport from someone. Use <a href="#who">the /who 
     command</a> and some of its filters to find a high-level Druid or Wizard: something like
     "/who Dr 40 60" for a Druid of levels 40 - 60. This will return a list of names. Ask
     everyone on that list if they can teleport you to somewhere near your destination. Be
     polite; it makes people much more likely to help you. More information on what being polite
     can do for you <a href="#polite">here</a>. Anyway, just ask around for a while, and 
     eventually someone will get you where you need to be. If yours is the other case (your
     corpse is close but surrounded by mobs) you will need to ask for an invisibility or 
     a camo. Use /shout to ask around. Once you have this, head off to your corpse. Once
     you reach it, you can't loot it right away, as this will dispel the camo/invisibility and
     the mobs will attack you. So you have to use the /corpse command. This summons your corpse
     to you from a maximum range of about 30 feet. Start backing away from the camp while
     hitting /corpse until you're a safe distance from the mobs, then loot and run. In both
     cases, knowing the loc of your corpse will help immensely; more information on that
     <a href="#loc">here</a>.

     <p>
     <a name="#faction"></a><br>
     <li><b>Faction</b><br>
     This is a relatively simple concept, but it's very important. Basically, when you kill
     something, you will sometimes recieve the message "Your faction standing with FactionXXX got better/worse."
     The first part of the message you get when <a href="#con">/conning</a> depends on your
     faction - if you have good faction, the message will say something like "NPCXXX regards
     you amiably" whereas if you have bad faction, the message will say "MobXXX glares at you, 
     ready to attack." You can improve or worsen your faction with certain groups by completing
     quests or killing certain mobs/NPCs. To sum all of this up, just remember that what you kill
     now will have consequences far into the future. You can find a listing of what factions
     are connected to which mobs by poking around <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com">here</a>.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#food"></a><br>
     <li><b>Food</b><br>
     This is a pretty stupid topic, but I thought I'd cover it anyway. Basically, you have to
     make sure that you always have some food and drink with you. If you don't, you will eventually 
     get the message "You are hungry/thirsty." A short while after that, your health will start
     dropping, and you won't be able to recover any mana. You don't have to worry about constantly
     checking your supplies, as you will recieve a warning if you are low on food/drink. 
     
     <p>
     <a name="#bind"></a><br>
     <li><b>Getting bound</b><br>
     Whenever you finish a long travel, it's a very good idea - a necessity, in fact - to
     get bound at a nearby city. This ensures that you will not have to trek across 5
     zones to retrieve your corpse if you die. People will usually bind you for 1 or 2 pp.
     Just ask using /shout and someone will answer you.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#group"></a><br>
     <li><b>Grouping</b><br>
     I could go about groups for pages and pages, but I think that how to be successful
     in a group can be summed up in six words: know your role and be coordinated. People 
     will talk about what the perfect group is, what the best camping spots are, what
     the best group spells are, but knowing your role and being coordinated are <b>much</b>
      more important. Knowing your role: Basically, know what you have to do in a group.
     For example, warriors have to attack the mob and keep it off of the casters. Druids
     have to buff the group members, provide backup heals and nukes, and snare the mob.
     Clerics keep the group members alive. If you know what you're supposed to be doing,
     you will be much more effective then just blundering your way through situations.
     Be coordinated: Have a system worked out. Make sure everyone knows what they're supposed
     to be doing. If the Ranger thinks he's going to shoot Orc #1, but the wizard thinks he's
     going to fire off a nuke at Orc #2, and the Druid thinks he's going to Harmony Orcs #1 and 2, 
     then pull Orc #3, you will end up with three Orcs on you instead of one.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#hot"></a><br>
     <li><b>Hot buttons</b><br>
     This is a very useful feature of the UI. Basically, it allows you to execute commands
     without typing the whole thing in, cast spells without clicking the icon, or activate
     an inventory item without digging around in your inventory screen. You will see the
     hot buttons box in the lower-left hand corner of the screen. There are 6 sets of
     buttons with 6 buttons each. You can access the sets by holding shift and pressing
     the corresponding number: Shift-1 for set 1, etc. You can activate individual buttons
     by pressing its number on the keyboard. You can create a hot button by clicking
     the desired button (spells, sit/stand inventory, camp, whatever) and holding the mouse
     button down. The button will eventually turn into a square button that can be placed
     in a hot button box. You can also make buttons for /whatever commands, such as
     /who, /loc, etc. You do this by clicking on the "socials" button in Windowed view.
     You will then be presented with a list of pre-programmed social hot buttons. If you
     right-click on the button, you will see a screen allowing you to change the command.
     You can make the command anything that can be typed into the textbox. If you
     want a button that executes the command "/say Help me!" you can do that. Or how about
     one that executes /who, instantly giving you a list of all players in the zone? Once
     the button is created, left-click on it and hold down, then put it in the hot button
     set.
     The practical uses of this are incredible and almost unlimited. If there's one particular
     command you use alot, make it into a hot button using the socials system. Play around with
     it, and you'll see how useful it can be.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#zone"></a><br>
     <li><b>Know your zone</b><br>
     It's very important that you know the zone you're heading into before you actually
     enter it. Know the danger spots, know where the guards are, know where to buy food,
     know where players gather and hang out, etc. Print out a map of the zone. Knowing
     where to go if you're in trouble will
     increase your survivability by about 100% while you're getting used to the zone.
     After you spend some time in the zone, you will be able to navigate it without the help
     of a map, but until then, this is essential.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#loc"></a><br>
     <li><b>The /loc Command</b><br>
     This is possibly the most important UI command there is. Basically, 
     it gives you your exact location in the zone at the moment when it's activated. The
     output of the command looks something like this: -1500, 600. The first number
     is your alignment on the game's Y axis (north-south). The higher the number, the farther
     north you are. The second number is your position on the zone's X axis (east-west). The
     higher the number, the farther west you are. Therefore, if you were in a zone that was
     6000 x 6000, with 0, 0 as the center (and 3000 units on either side of that), -3000, 
     -3000 would be the southeastern corner, and 3000, 3000 would be the northwestern corner.
     Anyway, the reason that this is so important is that it makes finding your body possible.
     If you hit /loc just before you die, you will know where in the zone you died. Then, 
     once you re-enter the zone, start running in a direction which gets you closer to your goal.
     You will know what direction you're running in by continually hitting /loc. If the numbers
     are both heading towards the numbers you want, you're going the right direction. I
     suggest making this a <a href="#hot">hot button</a> because you will be using it so often.
     There is a much more detailed explanation of this <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/locguide.html">here</a>.
     
     <p>
     <a name="#skills"></a><br>
     <li><b>Skills</b><br>
     How well you do things is determined by your skill rating for that thing. For example, 
     attacking things with a Rusty Scimitar would fall under the skill category of
     1H-Slashing. If you practice this skill enough (by attacking things) you will 
     raise your skill, therefore giving you a greater chance of hitting the target for
     more damage. At every level, there is a skill cap that you cannot pass while at
     that level. The cap is generally (level * 5) + 5. So at level 5, my cap would be
     30. Reaching the cap before you level is called "maxing out." It is recommended
     that you try to max out your skills at every level.

     <a name="#economy"></a><br>
     <li><b>The player economy</b><br>
     There is a very strong and fluid economy among the players of EverQuest. They sell each
     other rare or powerful items that usually can't be bought at a vendor, in addition
     to more normal equipment, like armor or weapons. If there's something you're looking for, 
     ask around using /auction. There's a good chance that someone out there will have what 
     you're looking for. The opposite is true as well. If you have an item that you think
     someone else might want, advertise it through /auction. 
     Eventually, someone will probably contact you. In both cases, you can probably get
     a better deal from a player than a vendor. Vendors tend to buy low and sell high. 
     A good place to sell and buy is the Greater 
     Faydark. This zone is a sort of marketplace, where people gather to buy and sell.

     <li><b>The /time Command</b><br>
     This command gives you the time in Norrath. It's very useful if you can't see at
     night and need to know when it's time to return to the safety of a city. 
     
     
     <p>
     <a name="#quests"></a><br>
     <li><b>Quests</b><br>
     There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of quests across all of Norrath. Most
     of the quests that are available to you as a newbie will reward you with a weapon or 
     two, some money, faction, and XP. This may not seem like a big deal, but they generally
     require little effort. Usually, all you have to do is bring a common item to a NPC 
     somewhere. The best place to find quests is at your class guild
     hall. Hail every NPC you see, and eventually someone will talk to you. I won't go into
     detail on particular quests because there are so many of them, but there is a very detailed
     and well-organized <a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest_search.html">Quest Database</a>
     at <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">Allakhazam's Magical Realm</a> - I highly
     recommend it.

     <li><b>What to do if you're attacked</b><br>
     If you are suddenly and unexpectedly attacked by wandering mob or find yourself
     on the losing end of a close fight (and believe me, 
     it <b>will</b> happen, there are a few things you can do.
     <ol>
     <li><b>Run.</b> This is generally the best solution, <b>if</b> a) there are guards or
     other players nearby or b) the zone line is nearby. The guards or other players can
     usually take care of the mob, and once you hit the zone line, the mob can't attack
     you any more. However, you have to make this decision quickly. After you
     health gets lower, you run a lot slower, making escape impossible. So if you're going
     to run, do it right away.
     <li><b>Duke it out.</b> If you think you can win, then by all means keep fighting.
     Just remember what I said about running late in a fight - it won't work.
     <li><b>Yell for help.</b> This is basically the same as number 2, but it involves
     calling for help while fighting, using the /y command. This command shows all players
     within a certain radius the message "NewbieXXX yells for help to the (direction) of you!"
     This is much better than simply /saying "Help me!" because it lets everyone know where
     you are. Also, it should be noted that /shouting "Help me!" is completely useless, because
     <b>no one</b> knows where in the zone you are. In my opinion, yelling for help is the
     best thing to do because it
     pretty much ensures that you don't die <b>and</b> you usually get credit for the kill.
     </ol>Basically, let the situation dictate what you do. If you are close to guards/players/zone line, 
     then just run. If you think you can win, keep fighting. If there are players nearby, 
     call for help. The most important thing to do is <b>don't panic</b>. Keep a cool
     head and you'll get out alive.

     <a name="#who"></a><br>
     <li><b>The /who Command</b><br>
     This is a very useful UI command. You can give it a bunch of parameters, and it will
     search the zone for any players matching those descriptions, and give you a list of
     all players that qualify. For example, say you're
     looking for a Magician of levels 5-7. You would type /who Mag 5 7. If you wanted to
     search the entire world, you would type /who all Mag 5 7. It also accepts names, 
     so you could do /who "playername" and it would tell you what level, class, and race
     that player is. This command is very useful,
     as it allows you to search for any type of player you want. You can find players for a
     group, find a high-level Wizard or Druid to TP you somewhere, etc.
