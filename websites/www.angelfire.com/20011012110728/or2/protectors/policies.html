<P>SOME SIMPLE GUIDELINES</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>The Protectors of the Five stand for the five Virtues, and are to represent and uphold them whenever possible.
<LI>As we stand for honor and justice, no Protector is to ever deny a person in need assistance if you are able to help them.  This does not require someone to go out of their way significantly, nor to leave a location to help someone, but if you are travelling, for example, and hear a cry for help that you can give aid in, you should help them.  Common sense is required here.
<LI>In an example of helping someone, if you are capable of porting and are headed somewhere that someone is shouting about, then give them a lift too if you can.  Little stuff like this helps promote the guild ideals and image.
<LI>No Protector will ever hunt any good race.  Corrupt members of a good race might be allowed as targets, this is under discussion.
<LI>Under no circumstances is a Protector to attack a guard that protects players.  Should the guard take offense at you and attack you are certainly encouraged to protect yourself however you are able.
<LI>The Protectors of the Five are to maintain a good, moral front in the game, as each member has the guild title attached to them and represents the guild at all times.  Some members stray in this and must be continually reminded heh heh.
<LI>The Protectors are a guild and are friends, and should treat each other with kindness, dignity, respect, and companionship at all times, even when someone is really annoying!
<LI>Any new item that a guild member can use should be considered for donation to a member in the guild.  We do not have a bank, per se, but should the need come up one will be started.  This is not a requirement, but it should be considered.  This does not in any way encourage gross twinking, no player should feel the right to get any items another player has, and should not pester anyone for items unless it is in jest.
<LI>Any items given you buy the guild that you out grow or replace should be given to someone needy within the guild if at all possible.  If there is no one who needs such an item, then do with it what you will.
<LI>If a spot is camped and people are not willing to share, then you should move on, this is a very large game and plenty of people in the Guild will port you if you need to.  We should be honorable and mature, and let others be the ones who will not do the right thing.
<LI>If an area has multiple camp spots, then a guild member should be willing to share or give up some of the spots without animus.  No guild member should be one of those people camping 15 spots in Lower Guk and keeping everyone out.
</UL>
<br>
<P>COMPLAINTS</P>
<P>The procedure to handling disputes in-house or out is going to be very simple and clear. The first thing everyone is going to have to know is who is their pathleader. We all chosen a path to follow and that is going to be the lines that we use to desighn the steps in the ladder of handling a dispute. For example, when johnny joined the guild he chose to follow the path of justice, Daedor (Pathleader of Justice) is his path leader.</P>
<UL>
<LI>	1. any problems that you may have must be taken to Your pathleader. your proof of the dispute must be submitted to them as well by way of e-mail as soon as possible so that your problem can be handled as quick and completely as possible. Now I did use the word proof, the only real proof that we are going to be excepting besides seeing it with our own eyes is a picture of the offense. 
<LI>	2. your pathleader will forward your complaint to myself and the pathleader of the person that you are having the problem with. The two pathleaders will try and resolve the matter between the two of them and myself will just simply be in the know of what is going on and what the results were. The Guild Master will only get involved if the 2 pathleaders are not able to resolve the issue.
<LI>	3. if your pathleader is not available or not been around for a bit you can submit the problem to the Guild Master or another pathleader. the differance in this will be that the Guild Master or the other pathleader will not be acting on the dispute we will just simple be acknowledging the complaint and we will try and contact the correct pathleader to handle it or the Guld Master will assign one to handle it on their behalf. If any pathleader receives a problem from a person not following their path they will forward the information to The Guild Master either in game or by way of e-mail.
<LI>	4. it must be known that these procedures can not be flexible. By using these procedures there will always be 3 of the officers of this guild resolving every matter and the results will be final. The procedures keep it from having any biased actions taken because no one will be handling a problem on their own and there WILL be proof (screenshot or screenshots showing the situation) of the accusations. 
</UL>
<P>OUT OF GUILD PROBLEMS</P>
The same procedure for filing the complaint and the same proof is required for such a complaint is required as well. The difference is that the Guild Master will be contacting the person and trying to resolve the matter based on what myself and the officer recieving the complaint decide is the best action. This way we have one voice and mutipule minds handling any disputes out of guild. All pathleaders will recive a copy of the complaint and proof and results of the actions so that we our all in the understanding of the stance that we took and with who. Therefore all officers of this guild will have knowledge of any problems we might be having outside. The Guild Master will not act on any complaints outside of this guild till it has been discussed with at least one other officer. Therefore no biased actions can result.
<P>I am hoping that the procedures will never be used however I feel it is important that they be placed in effect for any future problems that we may come accross. These procedures will bring full view of the problem and will also result in a quick resolution to the problem. I am also asking every Officer to make themselves an e-mail address and to post it on the boards so that it can be found easily and everyone knows where to go look for it.</P>
<br>
<P>DISCIPLINE</P>
<P>Unfortunately, even a group as virtuous and good as the Protectors of the Five will on occasion require some attention, and as such, the Guild has a policy for discipline and leadership.</P>
<P>All guild members must abide by the established policy as posted on the website. Any prospective members must read and agree to the policy prior to acceptance in the guild. If any member is found to have violated the policy, and has been observed 
by a minimum of two other guild members, they will be "called to task" by the appropriate path leader and receive 1 strike, they must also make amends. Refusal to make amends is an instant second strike. If amends are made, the strike is removed.</P>
<P>If, however the same member violates the same policy and is again observed then they will have an immediate 2 strikes against them. If the member has a plausible reason for violating the policy then the path leaders will meet and examine the policy 
to determine if a vote needs to be taken on an amendment.  Once a member has 2 strikes against them they are on probation, and lose voting privilege and must make amends to remove the strikes.  Single strike amends are to be determined by the path 
leader, double strike amends are to be determined by the path leader and the guild master.</P>
<P>If a member who has 2 strikes on them violates policy yet again, then they will be called before the leadership council (all path leaders and guild master) where they may state their case. If they have no case, or are deemed to not be upholding the policy 
the guild has established, they will be stripped of guild membership.</P>
<P>This policy is the fairest way of keeping our guild on the correct path, in all cases each member has multiple opportunities to right themselves, or call the policy to task for not being far-reaching enough. The need for two or more other guild members 
validating violation of guild policy should also halt a false accusations.</P>
