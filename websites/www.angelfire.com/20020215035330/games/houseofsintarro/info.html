<h1 align="center">Basic Information</h1>

<body>
In this section one can find some basic information about our guild and our rank system...
<P>
<B>Our Goal</B><P>
Our goal is to become a well respected, and powerful guild with in Norrath.  We want to be recognized by our arcane ways.  The word magic should become synonymous with Sintarro.  We would also like to enforce and promote a proper roleplaying environment for our guild and the rest of Norrath.  We form an alliance to do this; rather than fight as our ancestors did because of racial differances.<P>
<B>Our Rank System</B><P>
We have very delicate system of ranks for our guild.  First, we have our guild leader who is known as our 'Grand Magistrate'.  Then we have eight officers who are known as 'High Magistrates'.  The Grand and High Magistrates share equal power and make decisions together.  They our ranked above all others.  Each remaining members is catergorized into a circle.  These circles range from 1st circle to 10th circle; 10th being the highest (and 1st the lowest).<P>
In order for a guildmate to move up a circle they must 'challenge' another member who is one (and only one) circle above them.  A duel then takes place and the if the challenger wins, they move up a circle and the other member moves down.  In order to make this as fair as possible, we have established some guildlines for these challenges...
<UL>
<LI>A guild member may only make one challenge per week.
<LI>A challenge must be accepted, a decline admits defeat.
<LI>The challenger must travel to the challengee, and the challengee then has 30 minutes (of in game time) to accept this.
<LI>No loot may be taken from the unfortunate victim who lost.
<LI>To make the challenge official, a screenshot must be <a href="mailto:Niomar@kscable.com">sent in</a>...this screenshot should have the results of the duel (The message given to the members of EQ when someone loses/wins a duel...<I>[Guildmember] has just defeated [Guildmember] in a challenge to the death! </I>
<LI>The Grand Magistrate has official ruling on all disputes of records and duels.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Benefits of our Ranks</B><P>
If a guildmate is 10th circle, besides knowing they are one of the highest among our guild, there is the additional benefit of leadership above members of lower circles.  This leadership ability is not to be abused, it is merely used to handle disputes and to further our roleplaying.  And all members of lower circles are to show respect to the high ranking circles, within reason.
<P>
