: My Mom...Aventra...is in the hospital and doesn't know when they will let her out.  She had given me some names to try to find &quot;in game&quot; this morning, but they weren't on when I looked.  So she asked that I leave a message because she isn't sure when ahe'll be out and had 3 concerns!
: 1)  That she may miss the Guild meeting and didn't want to have her King, Queen and her guild family think that she just didn't care,...
: 2)  If not released by Sun, her dues would be late and she can't afford double dues right now,...
: 3)  Rendarian has been gone a few days and when he came back she didn't want him to think she'd gotton cold feet!  (lol...my Mom is sooooo adorable!)
: I came in a couple nights ago to meet on of you, as Mom had a few &quot;brothers&quot; she wanted me to keep an eye on and help if they needed.  (Too bad my character is only level 7, eh?)  I teased one unmercifully by  not telling him who I was.  So Kealob...I apologize whole heartedly, but I inherited my Mom's very twisted and warped sense of humor!  (and her long windedness)
: Any who, shw will kill me for telling you why she isn't here, but I have to be fair so you aren't thinking the worst.  A couple of her clients (she works in a secured residential treatment program for juvenile adolescents and does street work in Detroit with juvenile gangs and such) started fighting, she interevened and was stabbed a few times.  She says she is OK, &quot;no big deal&quot;.  The hospital says she is &quot;Damn lucky and has to cut this s*** out&quot;!  Gotta love my Mom...she is really awesome...the BEST!
: So, she'll KILL me for telling you all, but as far as she is concerned, you are all awesome!  Really becoming like family to her, and even tho she tries to protect her family at all costs, I (a family member to you all by relation!:^)) think you should know the scoop!  So...Rendarian, Kealob, Hoffy, Dakon, Jinni, Sunglare, Darbe, Rogan, Ronfar, Man?, Lil, Karsus, Volk, Heart, Amen, Cairbre,Zah?, Jenna, Cirth,and everyone else she has notes on (lol)...say a prayer for my Mom...and hopefully she'll be back before we know it!  She will discharge herself if she has too!  All she talks about is getting back to her guild family to learn, grow and help others!  Sheesh...what a woman my Mom is!
: I am in game when she isn't (I come to her house to share her computor for now...)so look for me or Llassie and I will keep you updated!  God bless!
