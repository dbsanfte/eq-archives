<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Well, Sunday night I finished my little trip over the Northern Mountain range. I was making the trip with a friend (Whom I met in AC).  After meeting in Arwic we traveled to the city as far north as possible, after using the life crystal there we proceeded to follow the river north. Unfortunately my companion was slaughtered when 6 Wasps of varying colors (I did see some Green and Blue, since I was running in sheer terror myself) spawned directly in front of us. I continued on alone, however, since I had gone to far to turn back (And my friends corpse was hidden underneath the water). I climbed the snowy slopes of the great Volcano (Nothing spectacular there, btw) did limited exploring of a Dungeon I found in the middle of nowhere (And retreived several VERY nice items from there). I crossed the entire range to the beach on the pointy peninsula in the far north, then ran for my life when several Shallows Slayers cought sight of me. And I took screenshots! Lots and lots of screenshots! As soon as I know its ok (Not a violation of NDA or somesuch) I'll put up a little website. Monday I picked up System Shock 2 ($29.99, I couldn't resist). Anyhoo, thats why I havn't been on this week (And I might add, SS2 is an excellent game. Even if near-impossible in difficulty). Tomarrow (Saturday), I'll be back in AC.
