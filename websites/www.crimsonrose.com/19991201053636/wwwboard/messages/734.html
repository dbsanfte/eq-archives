<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">This "anger" that I display towards the Red Wizards of Thay and the Zhentarim goes back nearly a century.  When I lived on Toril, I called Everska my home.  However, I was rarely there, simply because I was doing that I love best; spending time in the different areas of the world.  Then one day, as I was making my way through the forest outside of Cormyr, I heard a muffled scream... I followed that scream until I came to a meddow, small as it was, and on the edge of this meddow, 8 Zhentarim soldiers and two Red Wizards from Thay were beating and raping a teenage girl.  I didn't have to think twice, and from my concealment of the trees, I loosed four arrows into the first wizard, slaying him instantly, then the second.  When they spotted where I was firing from, I was forced to draw my blades.  None of them left that clearing alive.  That little girl was scarred for life because of the actions of Red Wizards and Zhentarim.  THAT is where my hatred and anger toward them comes from.<p>I ask you to rethink their invitation.<p><br>Mandon Ashenwood<br>Follower of Meilikki, Our Lady of the Forest, the Supreme Ranger, Daughter to Silvanus</FONT>
