<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">: Sometimes the pain and suffering brought about by life is too much for someone to handle...it seems that the loss of mama was more than Llassie could bear.  Last night she took our Cessna and chose to join Avantra in the deep blue sea.  She left a note saying that living without her love was unimaginable... for she had no belief that she would ever be able to continue healing and living without her.<br>: Adrikan, I am so sorry for your loss.  Sometimes people don't have faith in a better tomorrow...I guess Llassie may have believed that mama needed her more than we did.<br>: I will be once again flying tomorrow, to have Llassie's ashes join mama's.  Where will this all end?  When will this all end?  The Guardians will keep me strong, and I know your love and support will help.<br>: Thank you all for the love, caring and support you have always shared with me.<p>What can i say that would make the pain go away im at loss for words. Two great friends lost. Nothing hurtsd more than lsing someon you love. Im at lost for words</FONT>
