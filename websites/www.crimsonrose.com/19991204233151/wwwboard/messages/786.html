<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Now I am a good friend of Drelaii. I know Hoffy to be a nice person although I dont know him offline i know him online to be very nice and good hearted. Im just posting this message with the intent to say that, I although not of The Crimson Rose, am a friend of Hoffy and several others from the guild Cairbre is good one). I would believe Hoffy is not a thief. A person who gives out items regularly or which Drelaii has told me, would not steal from the guild. If he gives out items regularly what would there be to steal ooc. Although Ronfarre has some strong points, Id have to say that Hoffy did not steal from the guild and I know hes a very busy person and shouldnt have to be dealing with this hehe I say ignore Ronfarre.<p></FONT>
