"Lord Mandrake, Lord Mandrake!" Goldmoon shouted, "Diablo's minions have broken through the main gate and the Outer Keep has been overrun, what commands dost thou have for us?"<BR><BR>

The sounds of metal clashing and fires burning could be heard echoing throughout the defeated castle's chambers. The Throne Room was the only safe haven left inside the castle now. And it was there that the surviving members of the Council of Lords had gathered for their last stand.<BR><BR>

"I… I… Do not know" Mandrake stammered, "I cannot believe that…"<BR><BR>

Mandrake, a young King of only 19 winters, inherited the throne from his father's early death. Untested even on the battlefields the members trusted him none the less. All except one.<BR><BR>

"Believe it you fool!" Mayhem shouted, "Your delusions of taming this land have brought and end to all of us!"<BR><BR>

"Do not speak to the King in that manner" Lord Dantrag said, "He could not have known that Diablo would be sending a force this large!"<BR><BR>

"I will not die for another man's foolish plans" Mayhem lashed back at Dantrag, "You can stay and die here with this… this CHILD."<BR><BR>

Mayhem then threw his mysterious black cloak over his shoulders and disappeared into the darkness of the castle's chambers. A sense of uneasiness settled in the room as the angry assassin left.<BR><BR>

"He is right" Lord Mandrake said lowering his head, "I am the cause for all of this."<BR><BR>

"Do not listen to that amateur" Overkill spoke out, "he'll find death soon enough traveling alone in this battle."<BR>

Overkill, a warrior with a life darker then that of even Mayhem's. Overkill knew the ways even of Diablo's most elite toops better then any in the land. He took pride in protecting the guild from any threat that dared attack them. A powerful asset to the guild he was, but this time even his great skill could not stop Diablo's horde.<BR><BR>

"Draw steel!" Goldmoon, the elven warrior shouted, "They're at the door!"<BR><BR>

A hint of a smile came across Overkill's face as he drew his weapon. The pounding sound on the large oak doors had become deafening.<BR><BR>

"For the Glory of the Kingdom!" Dantrag shouted over the noise.<BR><BR>

The remaining members stood around the door awaiting the inevitable battle with their weapons drawn.<BR><BR>

CRASH!<BR><BR>

The once mighty doors splintered into hundred of fragments from the huge Mud Runner that now howled with joy. At that moment the forces of evil gathered at the beast feet began to pour in the room. The final stand had begun.<BR><BR>

~<BR><BR>

"Die you beast of Hell!" Dantrag shouted as he buried his battle-axe into the final deamon.<BR><BR>

The Throne Room was now a shattered into fragment of the glorious room it once was. Banners laid on the floor in tatters, statues knocked down and the foundation had been torn from the very ground of the room. Heaps of rubble lay across the floor and coughing and moaning could be heard through the gray cloud of dust.<BR><BR>

"Dantrag where is Mandrake?" Overkill asked worriedly.<BR><BR>

"I do not know" Dantrag said slowly scanning the debris for any sign of life.<BR><BR>

"Over there!" Goldmoon pointed.<BR><BR>

In the distance a large boulder sat in the middle of the room, atop it a large mangled banner of the Council of Lords. Beneath it, the opened bloody hand of their former leader.<BR><BR>

"NO!" Dantrag said running to his fallen Lords side.<BR><BR>

Quickly the members began assembling around the site of their fallen king. Bloody and wounded the members ignored their pains and watched with sunken hearts as death began to take Mandrake.<BR><BR>

"Stand back Dantrag" Alaster said "Let me help"<BR><BR>

Alaster the guild's arch-wizard began and incantation and with a powerful force of energy the boulder faded out of existence. Slowly the banner of the Guild drifted onto the shattered body of Lord Mandrake.<BR><BR>

"Avenge me…" Mandrake spoke out with his dying breath, slowly his grip let go of Dantrag's hand.<BR><BR>

"Who? Who did this to you?" Dantrag pled.<BR><BR>

At that moment Mandrake slipped away, and almost in unison the surrounding members closed their eyes and paid their respects for their fallen leader. After a short while a nervous voice spoke out,<BR><BR>

"What do we do now?" One of the castle guards asked.<BR><BR>

"Yes what now?" Another could be heard.<BR><BR>

"We will bury our fallen and leave this place" Dantrag quickly stated "Then we will find safety in other lands to rebuild our forces, who is with me?"<BR><BR>

"I will" The members all spoke at once, surprising Dantrag with their confidence.<BR><BR>

Dantrag then hoisted up the body of Mandrake into his arms and moved towards the door.<BR><BR>

"We have a lot of work to do and little time in which to do it in." He stated "Let us get to work"<BR><BR>

And with that the members began gathering their fallen and slowly moved out from the ruined castle. They headed towards a small village near Tristam, where the Council of Lords owned a large tavern. There, friends and allies would be to help them. From this tavern the former member of the Council of Lords began to heal and regroup.<BR><BR>

~<BR><BR>

Dantrag slowly walked away from the tavern late one night. The sounds of laughter and singing could be heard behind him inside the drinking hall. But tonight was a mournful night for the newfound leader of the former Council, the month anniversary of the fall of his Lord. Dantrag made his way to Mandrake's Tomb to pay his respects, when an old acquaintance showed.<BR><BR>

"You're out late tonight" A voice came from the darkness up ahead near the tomb.<BR><BR>

"Who's there?" Dantrag questioned.<BR><BR>

"An old friend" Mayhem then stepped out of the seemingly shadows themselves within an arms length of new leader.<BR><BR>

"Mayhem! You are alive?" Dantrag took a step back amazed "How did you find your way out of the castle that night?"<BR><BR>

"Tis a trade secret" he stated "But no talk of that, I have come to rejoin my comrades and to serve under your new command."<BR><BR>

"More members are always needed and your skills would be most helpful to us, but your loyalty to our cause has been questioned" Dantrag stated "what do you have to say to defend thyself?"<BR><BR>

Mayhem looked around uneasily, "I am ashamed of my actions that night and wish to earn back everyone's trust."<BR><BR>

"Very well, go to them. They are in the tavern sharing both spirits and stories, tell them I have sent you." Dantrag said, "But I would like to be left alone tonight"<BR><BR>

"Thank you my liege you shall not regret this decision" and with that Mayhem quickly headed towards the tavern.<BR><BR>

The tomb was beautiful, carved by both the finest Dwarven and Elven craftsmen in the area. Upon entering the tomb, Dantrag saw the sarcophagus of Mandrake carved from marble into the leader's likeness. Red roses had been placed atop the sarcophagus by other members, bringing color to the pale white tomb. Dantrag slowly picked up one of the roses and thought of how bravely they had fought night and how much they all missed Mandrake.<BR><BR>

Suddenly the tomb darkened and an apparition appeared above the sarcophagus. It took the form of a giant hissing snake with red eye slithering down an assassin's blade.<BR><BR>

"BY THE GODS!" Dantrag shouted stepping back.<BR><BR>

The apparition then disappeared as quickly as it had formed.<BR><BR>

"Avenge me Dantrag" came a voice from the sarcophagus "Take thy friends and bring glory to this realm once again."<BR><BR>

Dantrag looked down and saw that his hand began to bleed from the rose he held so tightly. The crimson colored rose awed him, a flower of such beauty and the ability to protect itself from being harmed.<BR><BR>

"Yes my liege, The Council of the Crimson Rose shall avenge thee and bring honor upon thy name." Dantrag said as he stood proudly.<BR><BR>

And thus the Crimson Rose came to be.<BR><BR>
