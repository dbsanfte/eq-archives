Welcome to the Crimson Rose Gaming Guild. Do to us moving from the Karana Server in Everquest, to the Ayonae Ro Server, we were unable to get our old name of "The Crimson Rose". In so doing, we changed our name to "Order of Rathmar" for that server/game only. We have been, and always shall be, The Crimson Rose. We have been together, as a guild, for over 6 years now. Since the arrival of more online games, we decided to move into them all. If there is a game that you would like to see linked, contact Dantrag or Ares and give 48 hours for it to be posted for you.<br><br><hr>

Don't miss this chance to see the latest and greatest upcoming features in the world of Norrath!<p>Registration for the event closes on June 4! Hurry and reserve your spot! <br>Visit http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/ to register or for more information!<p>*** Message about our Guide Program ***<p>Hail citizens of Norrath!<p>Hear my words, for I bring news of great importance.<p>Today I present to you an adventure, perhaps the greatest the Lands of Norrath have ever offered.  It is a quest of great proportions, and a journey fraught with danger.  Fear not though my friends, for the <br>spiritual rewards of this journey far outweigh any hardship involved.<p>As of now, we are once again gathering an adventuring party to protect and serve the lands of Norrath.  Scribes are lining up even now so that they may take your application to become a Guide of Norrath.<p>We are seeking those strong in character, bright in wit, soft with compassion, and filled with joy.<p>If you've ever felt good helping a fellow adventurer retrieve his corpse, or with helping someone when they felt all was lost, then this is truly the adventure for you.  Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens.  Maybe your renowned acting skills might be of help.  If you are kind, compassionate, and <br>helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.<p>If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be difficult at times.  You can be assured that you will be tried... and hopefully you will be found true.  In the end though, the citizens <br>of Norrath will benefit from your thoughtful participation, and the lands of Norrath will continue to become a better place.<p>If you feel this is something you must be a part of, then I invite you to point your browser to: http://guideapp.everquest.com<p>We ask so little of your time, but the benefits you can bring to Norrath are grand.<p>A few things to remember:<br>1) You must have an active EverQuest account in good standing.<br>2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.<br>3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.<br>4) You will need good communication skills.<br>5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.<br>6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.<p>Come one, come all... help us to make the lands of Norrath better than they already are... come be a part of the EverQuest Guide Program!<p> - The EverQuest Guide Program<p>*** Important Reminder ***<p>Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch.  GMs will have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.  That means that <br>they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one.  It is also important to understand that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning from EverQuest.<p>** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **<p>We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time. In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were <br>unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in and check on it right away after the patch.<p>So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of them disappearing.<br>Thanks.<p>- The EverQuest Team<p>*** Patch Message ***<p>** Zone Changes **<p>- Runnyeye has been changed.  Something is up in Goblin land...<p>** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **<p>- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code.  For the most part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to stack that were never intended to stack.<br>- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.<br>- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of Cazic Thule can scribe it.<br>- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been changed to be more appropriate.<p>** Features and Interface Changes **<p>- The variable %t will now work with /assist.  So you can use /assist %t if you wish.  Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist without the %t.<br>- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.<br>- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to user color 15 (same as other skill messages). The success message was already set to user color 15.<br>- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does. It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server.  The new ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list (<character name>_<#>.ini).  The first time a character is created or loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.<br>- The Alt key now works in several new situations.  It will now show item names when in the trade window.  Because the trade items of the local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item <br>names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade <br>window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade item names.<br>- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.<br>- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.<br>- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they don't show up otherwise).<br>- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any player that is on your /ignore list.  Some players were using this to annoy players that had ignored them.<br>- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to annoy people that had ignored them).<br>- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the members of your guild in your zone.  You can also specify a guild name, such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".<br>- /safelock command added.  /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface (mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash commands) with the password that you supply to the command.  You must use this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the interface.  Passwords are NOT case-sensitive.  So to lock your interface, <br>you would type /safelock password.  You would do the same to unlock it. REMEMBER:  If you forget what password you typed, you will need to reboot your machine.<p>** Item Changes **<p>- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<br>- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.<br>- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of your waist.<br>- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop. They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. <br>- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable. There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so we had to disable that for these items.<br>- Sewing Kits:  No existing sewing kits are being changed with this patch.  But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different. Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots.  Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.<br>- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.<p>**  Other Stuff **<p>- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level bard title.  :)<br>- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with that of his counterparts in Velious. This is not the sort of thing that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest.  We're announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.<p>- The EverQuest Team<br>

There are just over two more weeks left to register so don't delay! For each of these events, we get countless e-mails asking if there is any space <br>available after we have sold out... and then it is too late! So don't wait until registration is closed! Register now and be sure your spot is reserved!<p>** Bug with the PvP /consider system! **<p>The new /consider system is NOT working on Tallon and Vallon Zek. It is only working on Rallos Zek.  So if you play on Tallon or Vallon, be aware that the /consider system on those servers has not changed. We will fix this for the next patch.  We're sorry for any confusion this may have caused.<p>** Guild Wipe for Guilds without enough members **<p>On May 15th we will be performing another servers-wide guild wipe for any guild with less than ten members.  Remember, it is always a requirement to have ten members in your guild.  These ten members must <br>all be characters from separate accounts (only one member from each account will be counted for the ten member total).<p>So if your guild does not have ten members on Tuesday, May 15th, it will be deleted.<p>We're sorry for being so harsh about this rule, but there is a distinct limit to the number of guilds that we can support, and the rules for maintenance of a guild are clear.<p>- The EverQuest Team

The <br>character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him.  The character<br> will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack.  And the character will show as<br> 'red' if he is above your range.  This will only take effect on PvP servers.<br>- Sanctuary Levels:  Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they<br> take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.  This will, obviously, only take place on PvP servers.<br>- De-Leveling:  Characters that lose levels will only retain the combat skills of a character two <br>levels higher.  This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character <br>will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character.  This change will apply to <br>all servers (it has to, code-wise).  So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people <br>that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), <br>while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find <br>themselves at no great advantage.<p>These are the first of the things that we plan to.  We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach <br>to changes whenever we can, and we have other changes planned for upcoming patches.<p>** Quest Changes **<p>-  We've made a change to the Velious armor quests.  The folks in Kael and in Skyshrine that give <br>out rewards for these quests are now being stricter about who they will reward quest items to.  You <br>will have to be considered an 'ally' (see Features section below) by these NPCs in order to be able <br>to complete these quests.  If you are doing quests for the Coldain, however, they are somewhat less <br>picky, and they only require that they consider you 'kindly' to reward you for your labors.<br>- The Black Silk Cape will now drop more frequently.<p>** Bug Fixes **<p>- Attacking with a two-handed piercing weapon will now 'gray-out' the attack button as it should.<br>- Text that once read: "You cannot remove this affect." now reads "You cannot remove this effect."  <br>Changed by popular demand... :)<br>- Food Emotes:  Forcing your character to eat by right clicking food will now properly display the <br>appropriate emote to those in the area.<br>- Fixed a problem that often made it difficult to loot really large NPCs.<p>** Item Changes **<p>- The Shield of Tsunami can now be equipped in the secondary slot.<br>- Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows, the better the quiver the faster your bow.  We will not <br>be listing the speed increase a quiver will give your bow, but you can tell the good quivers by their <br>ability to reduce the weight of your arrows (better-made or magical quivers have this property).<br>- The Ivory Handled Falchion should now 'proc' without telling you that it is out of charges.  You <br>may need to contact your GM to replace the item with a new version if it is still acting strangely. <br>- The Opal Bracelet is now a wrist item, not a finger item.  Be aware, once you remove it from your <br>finger, it will not go back onto that finger, it will only fit on your wrists, as it should.<br>- The Large Dragonbone Shard will no longer appear to be a Staff of the Gathering.<br>- The Ring of Levitation will now poof when all the charges are used up, and should display the <br>correct number of charges.<br>- The Priceless Velium Reinforced Bow now has a range of 200 instead of a range of 0.<br>- The Refined Mithril Blade should now be equipable in both primary and secondary slots.<br>- The Unicorn Horn should now have a graphic.<br>- The Hammer of Flattening has been changed from tiny to large.  This might cause you a little <br>reorganization in your inventory.<br>- Runebranded Stone Buckler is now labeled as a shield and can be used to bash.<br>- The Ring of Pureblood is now a finger item, not a waist item.<p>** Spell Changes and Additions **<p>- Translocation spells:  Five new Wizard 'push' spells have been added (Translocate: Fay, Tox, <br>North, Combine and Group).  Translocate spells send the group to the location, while the Wizard <br>remains behind.  Translocate Group sends everyone in the group (except the Wizard) to their own <br>bind points.  Translocate Group can be found on NPCs in Velious (and they won't give them up easily).  The others are available on an exclusive vendor.  All Translocate spells (even the original Translocate) have confirmation boxes that must be accepted before the target will be sent.  And Wizards can no longer Translocate themselves.<br>- Some lower 39th and 44th level Velious spells have had their drop rates increased.<br>- GM Resurrection has had it's name changed from ResurrectionGM to Customer Service Resurrection so <br>that players will be able to better tell when they are getting a resurrection from the GM staff. GM <br>resurrection will no longer have Res effects, and will leave the newly Ressed with full Hit Points <br>and Mana.<br>- Divine Aura and spells of that type (Divine Aura - cleric, Divine Barrier - cleric, Kazumi's Note <br>of Preservation - bard, Harmshield - necromancer, Quivering Veil of Xarn - necromancer) will now <br>prevent the caster from being stunned when hit for their duration.<br>- The Eye of Zomm series of spells will no longer work in Kedge Keep.  This change was made to <br>prevent an exploit.<br> <br>** Feature Additions and Changes **<p>- Looting text has been changed.  You will now see a -- before and after any loot messages.  This <br>has been changed primarily to help prevent any fake looting messages from being thought of as real.<br>- When you loot an item, you will receive a text message telling you what you have just looted.<br>- Expanded Friends List:  The Friends List will now hold 30 character names.  And each character has <br>its own friends list.  You can find and edit this list with a text editor, if you need to, outside <br>the game.  You can locate the text files in your EverQuest directory.  The files will look like <br>this:  <character name>_<#>.ini.  The default Friends List for existing and new characters will be <br>your old Friends List.<br>- The destroy or drop item confirmation box will now close if you accidentally pick up another item <br>while they are open.  This should prevent accidentally deleting or dropping the wrong item.<br>- When selling to a merchant, you can no longer sell items that are inside a container by having the <br>container selected and clicking the sell button.  The merchant will tell you that you need to empty <br>the container before the merchant will buy it.  This should prevent folks from accidentally selling <br>items that they did not know were in those containers.<br>- You can now move items around inside containers that are in the bank.<br>- There is a new /consider message: "regards you as an ally".  This is the highest level of <br>friendliness that an NPC will register using the /consider command.  The faction required to reach <br>this rating is significantly higher than 'warmly'.<p>- The EverQuest Team
