        I feel that my apprentice Scribe (aka Aarythis) has finally earned
        his &quot;freedom&quot;. He will now be the main operator of
        the public site and this should be the last post you see from
        me here for a long time. So Scribe... you can stop crawling out
        of those sewers and join me in the tower, this will also end
        your apprenticeship in game as well. You have done a great job,
        and I hope you continue in the future.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">But Fear Not!!! I shall
        not be leaving you friends... I will be dedicating myself and
        efforts to the members only page. Our in character private area
        of the site will be updated as frequently as the main site with
        quest info and guild functions and ideas. I hope you all will
        like the style... expect work to begin this weekend.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Congrats Scribe!!!</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Goodbye ... and farewell,
        I enjoyed creating the site and running it. But as the guild
        grows as must I and move on to other areas that I am needed.

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Here we have a prime
        example as to why players SHOULD be banned and AWSOME examples
        as to why guilds should be torn down by the Gods that be! This
        would have not been a problem if this ignorant child would have
        insulted us in a role-play manner - but due to the lack of imagination,
        one to many &quot;doobies&quot;, and him failing all his/her
        English Courses, we have been resorted to do this. So, to the
        wonderful individual here in these pictures, Bargash has been
        notified to look here. Whether he does or not, that is up to
        him. What action to be taken? I hope your account be pulled for
        this. What we would like to see happen? A formal apology on our
        message board from this guild. Will it happen? Probably not.
        But we have done what we can. And they have shown what they are.
        So, in lue of this, I revert to my old self in matters such as
        these, and quote scripture from my Bible. It goes something like
        this, and I quote, &quot;When your enemy becomes aggressive,
        you take out a nitro injected, super induced, sawed-off short
        barrel on tractor trail tires, depleted uranium piercing, mercury
        explosive tipped Howitzer and hope thay don't make you angry
        again.&quot; Ok Ok - So I made my own copy of the Bible. Who
        cares.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Here is the Producers
        Letter that has been recently updated from the Everquest Site:</FONT></P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">6/29/99
<BR>
          Welcome to the new Producer's Letter!</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Yes,
          I realize there was one before, but it was rarely updated. The
          reason for that, honestly, was that for so long I've always communicated
          to EQ players primarily through posts on message boards and fan
          sites. In fact, for those of you who have been with EQ since
          before even the Beta, that's kind of where it all started. A
          lot of the excitement and anticipation generated for EverQuest
          before release was grass-roots in a sense, with me posting and
          doing chats and all sorts of fan sites and guild pages popping
          up into existence.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">It was
          a wonderful time and it's a communication process I've both enjoyed
          and feel comfortable with. But the problem now is simply how
          many people are playing EverQuest, and reading and posting to
          these sites. It's hard for me to get the message out sometimes
          - I've even posted before in response to a player and then the
          next day read another post on the same site complaining that
          they haven't seen me post for weeks and how we need to improve
          our communication. There were simply so many posts that mine
          was gone by the time this person began reading.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">So it
          occurred to me (and it probably should have occurred to me earlier
          - doh!) that there has to be a better way for me to address the
          EQ community as a whole in order to keep all of you more informed.
          It is my hope to at least weekly, if not more often, post the
          Producer's Letter here on everquest.com and that the various
          fan sites and other EQ related boards would copy this letter
          into their news or to wherever else makes sense.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Now,
          before any of you panic, I'm still going to be out there reading
          the boards and posting responses probably just as often as I
          always have been. It's something I enjoy and I think it's very
          important to the growing community that we keep this two-way
          communication going. But the difference will be that whenever
          it makes sense to post something lengthy and in-depth, I'll use
          the Producer's Letter. That way, when major issues come up, I
          can reach the most people. The types of posts I'll still make
          to various boards and newsgroups will more often be answers to
          specific questions or simply general comments.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">And,
          of course, the various sites and discussion boards will quite
          often be the source for my inspiration to write the Producer's
          Letter. It's where I'll gather topics and ideas. You can expect
          to see all sorts of issues addressed, including camping, class
          balance, the player-driven economy, crowding, connectivity, etc.
          That's right - I won't shirk from the heated controversial stuff
          at all. You'll also see me discuss how things work here at Verant,
          what features and additions we're working on and how we're working
          on them. I'll talk about how we meet together as a Dev Team and
          debate issues and how changes are implemented. And I'll also
          cover exciting new stuff, like the new zones we're working on
          that will be downloadable in the future, as well as the huge
          Expansion coming next year.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Anyway,
          I really hope this helps. I'm sure the heated and passionate
          discussions will continue, and that is both normal and healthy
          for an ever evolving and dynamic game like EverQuest. But at
          least everyone will know better our positions on the various
          issues and what our plans are to address them. You'll know that
          we're thinking about things too over here -- and not just thinking,
          but working very hard to earn the money you've spent and continue
          to spend on EverQuest.</FONT></P>

        It is linked from his name on the members list. All I can say
        is...WOW! And I thought I was long winded! hehe - This is a MUST
        read story! One question Kirel, what happend to the butler? And
        I REALLY think it was done in the kitchen. Just my humble opinion
        though.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">After much heated debate
          on the Forums I am proposing a solution to make the warrior become
          king of melee combat. It does not involve the implementation
          of any new skills into the game.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">1.Remove the Cap on Combat
          Skills (offense, defense, 1H slash, kick, dual wield, parry,
          etc.) which comes into effect around level 40. <BR>
          2.Allow Warriors to advance 7 points in Combat Skills per level
          instead of just 5.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">This would mean that
          at beginning levels warriors show small improvement at melee
          over the hybrids, but by the time they hit the teens and the
          hybrids are getting their spells the warriors are starting to
          out-melee them. They would be hitting much more often and they
          would be much harder to hit.</FONT></P>
