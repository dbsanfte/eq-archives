<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">: I must say that what I am about to do is something that I truly regret doing.  But, what must be done, must be done.  I have found that I have less and less time to wander aimlessly though the reaches of Norrath, and more and more responsiblities piled upon me.  I cannot, in good faith, continue my farce.  I must respectfully step down from the honorable position as Inqusitor and allow a more worthy individual to take my place.  I must also leave the guild for a good while.  I may be seen here or there, but I will not, CANNOT, be in the public eye any longer.  The death of two good friends has saddened me to a point where I must take my leave of all public interaction and begin a period of inflection.  I thank you all for being there when I needed you, and when i thought i didn't.  I will return to the halls one day soon, until then, goodbye and godspeed to you all.<p>: Sincerely,<br>: Adrikan Soth <p>Farewell my friend. I hop i shall see you again but if not i just want to let you know i always considered you a friend and a great person,some i could always count on to talk to</FONT>
