<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">An old and broken wood elven druid walks up to the proud group of Crimson Rose warriors. The old druid is hunched and leans heavily on his worn wooden staff. Words come mumbling out of his long white beard. His wrinkled hands shake unstopable while they stroke through the same beard that fumbles his speech, but as you carefully listen you can understand him, like the whispering of the wind trough the trees.<p>"Greetings furtile and naive youngsters. You look like a proud group of people. But you will learn, in time, you will learn."<p>He starts laughing some what histerically, but the laughter soon turns into coughing. You wonder who this strange figure is, furtile younsters?<p>"Ah yes yes" he continues "I can see it in your eyes. You don't remember me. Ah, well, yes, that is after all what time does to us. Nature will take its course."<p>He pushes some warriors aside as he seems to be looking for some one or some thing. You notice that he has more strenght in his broken body than you would have guessed. Then the old druid seems to have found what he was looking for.<p>"Aaaah, I salute you Dantrag Gryfonsbane. And you too, beautiful as always, even for an old man as me, Jenna Gryfonsbane. I greet you all Crimson Rose. You are the truth of Norrath, remember that as you walk these lands."<p>The old man, seems less hunched, not as old, fire lights up his eyes. You recognize something in the face. Could it be?

Know that when the winds blows trough your hair that it blows for you. That when you see the mountains that divide Tunaria you know they are there for you. You are the protectors of everything that is good and right. You are the light that holds of the darkness. May your virtue shine upon the dark roads that cross this world. But for now I can not join you in your battle. I am tired, I need to sleep and before that I have sad news for your King. For now farewell, but expect me to help you in your battle soon enough."<p>The old druid falls back on his staff, his hands shake again and you wonder if you imagined this sudden burst of energy that radiated from his eyes. He shuffles of to the shadows, supported by a helpfull warrior. You wonder why this old friend has visited the Crimson Rose again after such a long absence, and what has happened to his apperence? However you can not linger long about his sudden visit, new dangerous are to be fought and evil never seems to rest. You go back to your every day business and forget about this strange traveler.</FONT>

: An old and broken wood elven druid walks up to the proud group of Crimson Rose warriors. The old druid is hunched and leans heavily on his worn wooden staff. Words come mumbling out of his long white beard. His wrinkled hands shake unstopable while they stroke through the same beard that fumbles his speech, but as you carefully listen you can understand him, like the whispering of the wind trough the trees.

: The old man, seems less hunched, not as old, fire lights up his eyes. You recognize something in the face. Could it be? Is it him. What has happened to him.

: &quot;Ah yes, I see some of you remember, I am indeed Gadel. But who I am is not important. It is who you are that matters now.
