<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">: We need a short desc of the guild written up for our area of the AoK site.  I've had a couple people tell me they'd get me something and yet no pigeons have arrived.  Please go to the guilds area of the AoK web page and click the arrow next to our name, where it talks about a description is about the size of what I'd like created.  If you are up for the job, get me your text as soon as possible!  I've been asking for this for a few weeks now with little response, someone out there must be willing to donate a little effort into this project.  I hope!  =)<p>: Cirith<p>I sent one apparently the meil didnt go through.</FONT>
