Welcome to the Crimson Rose Gaming Guild. Do to us moving from the Karana Server in Everquest, to the Ayonae Ro Server, we were unable to get our old name of "The Crimson Rose". In so doing, we changed our name to "Order of Rathmar" for that server/game only. We have been, and always shall be, The Crimson Rose. We have been together, as a guild, for over 6 years now. Since the arrival of more online games, we decided to move into them all. If there is a game that you would like to see linked, contact Dantrag or Ares and give 48 hours for it to be posted for you.<br><br>
<br><br>This is just a test to see if raw HTML can be done.<br><br><hr>

Neverwinter Nights will not be published by Interplay who Bioware is in the process of suing over not being paid royalties and sub-licensing their games out to other publishers, though Bioware is claiming that it is still in development and will be released early next year. Now this, to put things very mildly, is bad. Bad for Bioware, bad for Interplay, bad for Neverwinter Nights in general. Not that I think that Bioware should have kept developing a game when they're having problems with the publisher and not that I think that Interplay had much choice in the matter in terms of their own actions (these things are never as simple as they appear to be at first glance), but this effectively ends any chance of Neverwinter Nights ever reaching store shelves. That statement that they are "looking forward to releasing Neverwinter Nights on schedule, early in 2002" cannot be true for one very simple reason. Remember that the game is based on Dungeons and Dragons, and the specific setting of the Forgotten Realms. On top of that it shares it's title with an already existing online RPG. All of that had to be licensed from somewhere and care to guess who holds at least the Forgotten Realms license for the next few years? That would be Interplay and that means Bioware can't release Neverwinter Nights in it's current form unless they do it through Interplay. <p>Fortunately for those of you looking forward to playing Neverwinter Nights, there is a way out. At least to ways out, in fact. Interplay only holds the license to the Forgotten Realms, the rest of Dungeons and Dragons and most of the other settings either have their rights scattered to the four winds when TSR in it's last days handed out game development licenses like they were candy. There's a lot of companies out there that can make a Dungeons and Dragons based game assuming it uses the correct setting. And if that wasn't enough Bioware can take Neverwinter Nights straight to Infogrames who has the key license from Hasbro. Naturally this means reworking a good portion of the game; all references to anything that falls under the Forgotten Realms license (like names of places and characters like Elminster) would have to be purged. There's a good chance that several of the key locations in the game would have to be completely redesigned. Some aspects of the game would have to be rethought if it was reworked for another license; why take it to the Dragonlance setting, for example, unless you're going to take advantage of the unique features of it. There's no way that Bioware could shift all of that in four months to be released in "early 2002". <p>The other option is particularly devious though much more narrow and more risky. There's one company other than Interplay who is allowed to make games in the Forgotten Realms setting and only through a loophole in the contracts in the original Dungeons and Dragons license. That company is Ubisoft since they purchased the shell of Mattel Interactive who purchased the Learning Company who purchased SSI creators of the original Neverwinter Nights. You might have noticed that Ubisoft got away with releasing a sequel to the original Pool of Radiance game despite Interplay having the license to the setting that the game takes place in. It's not unreasonable to suspect that they might also be able to release a sequel to Neverwinter Nights. There are a few problems with this, though. First, if one of the groups in that chain of companies sold the rights to the name Neverwinter Nights to Interplay (as opposed to Bioware) perhaps in exchange for not getting into a legal battle over the sequel then Interplay might be able to squash that option and we're back to Bioware reworking the game for another publisher (perhaps into Curse of the Azure Bonds 2 or Hillsfar 2). Also Ubisoft would have Bioware over a barrel in these negotiations; deal with them and them alone or spend another eight months in development. <br></blockquote><p>There's probably ALOT of crap going on behind the scenes that I don't know about, so I'm not about to place blame on one or the other party.  I am, however, quite disappointed.

I come to you all now with a bit of information about the new expansion for EverQuest. True, most, if not all, of this is probably known, but for the benefit of those who don't...shush. ;)  The expansion is schedualed for release on Monday, and with it comes a whole load of stuff.<p><b>New Graphics:</b> With the "wonderfully" steep <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3900">system requirements</a> already pretty much known and lamented, there's going to be quite abit offered.  To make it basic, they're simply supporting all the features of DirectX 8.0 including Hardware T&L.  With this, you'll have access to <a href="http://www.eqloft.com/encyclopedie/luclin/galerie3.html">the new player models</a> and even a <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/screenshots2/default.asp?category=7">re-texturing of the old world</a>  The zones should also increase the max clip plane (how far into the distance you're able to see) for those with higher end systems.<p><b>Gameplay:</b>  We all know of the introduction of the new race <a href="http://www.eqloft.com/encyclopedie/luclin/images/luclin102.html">(The Vah Shir)</a>, and the new class <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Beastlord">(The Beastlord)</a>.  The expansion, however, offers much more to the upper level characters as well.  With the new <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3826">Skill advancement system</a> players level fifty-one and above will have the ability to earn various <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3901">extra skills</a> to use in the advancement of their character.  The inculsion of <a href="http://www.eqloft.com/encyclopedie/luclin/images/luclin94.html">horses</a> which serve as a kind of permanant SoW on your character, as well as a status symbol, will be available for purchase...at a steep price.  Getting to Luclin will not exactly be a cup o' tea either.  Initinaly, Wizards and Druids will NOT have the ability to teleport themselves or anyone there.  Everyone must wait at special teleport pylons scattered throughout Norrath for each "Mass Teleport"  Think of it as an instant boat ride...only with the same wait.  There are allegedly other changes such as the new "uber" mobs not needing a many people to kill, and the fact that it's just reintroducing the exp bar to the level 60's.  What impact, if any, these effects will have on the upper level population remains to be seen.<p>On to more mundane things.<p>I am aware that the Message Board is broken.  No, I do not know what is the problem.  I have a couple of theories, and I'm in the process of testing them...but it'll take time.  I don't have a temporary solution just yet, but I'm looking into that as well.  I just ask that you bear with me.  I have finals in the coming weeks, and then after that I can devote more time to figuring out just what went wrong.  Till the next time, this is Adrikan Soth taking off.

The servers will be brought back on line December 4th at 8 AM. These stated times are Pacific Standard Time (-8:00 GMT). <p>The EverQuest Team regrets the downtime that setting up the new expansion requires, but due to the large amount of new content and improved graphics, it is hoped that the EverQuest players will find the extended patch is well worth the effort.<p><B>DirectX 8.0 or higher Required for EverQuest</B><p>When we update the servers on December 3rd for Shadows of Luclin, we will also be updating a lot of the code for the existing game. This code is written specifically for use with DirectX 8.0 and higher, and should provide better performance to most of our customers. The improvement will be most noticeable for people using newer hardware.<p>This will require that all EverQuest players update their DirectX to version 8.0 or better to play EverQuest. We will be providing an instructional page to help people with this upgrade in the very near future at www.everquestlive.com. If you want to test your DirectX 8 configuration and drivers sooner rather than later, you can do so by running "TestEverQuest.exe" in your EverQuest directory and logging on to the Test Server. Please view the patch message there for information should you have any problems logging in.<p>Be Prepared.
