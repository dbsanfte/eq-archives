          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-1">         I must say, this
          came quite out of the blue.  All of a sudden.. you've ordered
          me to be REMOVED from the guild without even bothering to say
          why?  Jinni contacted me with the news yesterday, but I miss-read
          what the message due to spam, and thought that she was asking
          me to remove her tag.  I told her she could /guildremove herself
          and went about my business.  Earlier today, Cirith came on and
          also informed me of your order.. at which point I got a teleport
          away from my group deep within the Mino side of Guk to sort out
          this issue.  Cirith and I had a discussion, which turned more
          into me ranting about you and how I was dissatisfied with your
          actions as Guild Leader.  Cirith listened to me, but he still
          was bound to your order to remove me, so I went anon for the
          time being while I continued to talk with him.  Jinni came on,
          and I confirmed with her what message she had sent me yesterday,
          and I realized my error in reading it.I then proceeded to bid
          the two of them farewell, leaving some choice parting words about
          you.  I will try to restate them now so you can hear them from
          the original source. </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-1">What really has perturbed
          me about this whole situation is that NO ONE ever mentioned a
          bit that I may not be doing things as you wished.  I'm sorry
          if I wasted 3+ weeks on my Armor of Ro, which was  broken for
          a week, and then finally realized as the laughing stock of Paladins.I
          bid my time then alone, and only asked for assistance in taking
          down a Nightfall Giant.  After this, I became frustrated with
          EQ and began to play less and less. I withdrew from the game
          temporarily and resumed some other interests.  I came back periodically
          to try and hunt in Sol B, but was trained out so many times I
          gave up yet again. Recently, I began to quest in earnest for
          Soulfire, and did not ask anyone for help because no one who
          was on at the time stood a chance of even harming Sir Lucan,
          or Xicotl. I will agree that I have not spent a lot of time recently
          helping members level, or giving items down.  I have, however,
          very little in items in my bank account that I can give away
          in the first place.  I have not gotten a new item in nearly 4
          weeks because of combine questing for Ro/Soulfire, and previous
          disgust with the dungeons.  If members wanted to get my help,
          they could have come to me when I was on, but no one even approached
          me to ask for a sliver of assistance, nor was anyone near to
          my position.  On top of that, I was not playing Rogan much at
          all because I realize Verant's obvious bias against Paladins,
          so I played Rogan much less, and started a Gnome Magician to
          play to try and make EQ fun again.  I had reached that point
          and was ready to go get Soulfire, and good items for the guild...
          but you kicked me out of the guild. Now, I understand that you
          expect me to help the guild, but if I'm not living up to your
          satisfactions, wouldn't TELLING ME be a good idea instead of
          just kicking me out?  No one, and I stress.. NO ONE expressed
          dissatisfaction with me in any way prior to your order to remove
          me.  I have been at every guild meeting that I can remember,
          and you had numerous opportunities then, in game, or via E-mail
          that you could have expressed your feelings.  If you want to
          go on a power trip and strip people's tags without warning, and
          go removing people on a whim, that is your business as the Guild
          Leader. I promise you, however, you will find your membership
          quite low if you continue to act as a Tyrant with absolute power.

          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-1">I expect to hear back from
          you on this matter, and in a timely matter.  If one week passes
          and you have not satisfactorily answered to my charges, I will
          raise a stink about this.  I will let the community know of your
          actions, and the kind of ruler you are.  I will let people know
          that you are intending to turn Crimson Rose into Combine, which
          seems to be your current objective.  And lastly, I will damage,
          if not destroy your reputation, and that of the whole guild as
          well.  I don't want to hurt the people who serve you, but any
          actions I take upon you will surely fall upon the guild as a
          whole. </FONT></P>

          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Well... I am answering to
          your &quot;Charges&quot;...And you will find that my decision
          was fair AND just. Lets start at the beginning...to refresh your
          memory a little.... </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Remember a few months ago...I
          was holding lotto's in Rivervale? You were one of those there
          that got an item. You remember this item? A +9 Str shield. I
          asked for nothing in return...HOPING that the guild would catch
          on to what I was doing to in turn do the same....However, this
          was for nought. </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Now...speed up time a bit....
          </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Remember me coming to you
          several weeks later and asking if you had an FBR (as someone
          in the guild said you did)? You said yes...but that it was for
          a friend, and that if I REALLY needed it, I could have it. I,
          in turn said, Great, Where can we meet? You then replied with
          something along the lines of, Why do you need it? Your a Paladin,
          Paladins cant use FBR's. And you kept on wanting to know why
          I wanted it. Remember this? First of all...I have several high
          level characters, I think, as well as many of the members of
          the guild, know, that an FBR is not for a Paladin, and secondly,
          as the &quot;King&quot; of CR, I owe no explanations to you,
          or anyone else in this guild about my day-to-day activities when
          it pertains to a deal I am doing. IT was for a REALLY good deal
          I was brewing. Now...do you remember me saying....Nevermind....I
          dont need it.....? </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Ring a bell so far? If not,
          let me jar another memory.... </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Since you have been about
          L35+, you have flaunted your &quot;power&quot;. I have sat and
          watched this and as well, have been the recipient of this banter.
          i.e...&quot;I can whoop you with just my shield...&quot;, &quot;Want
          me to come over and teach em a lesson...&quot;, &quot;How would
          they feel if a L40 Paladin showed up....&quot;....etc etc....This
          is not the type of behavior that I want within CR. This has been
          said to members within Guildchat. If this is said within Guildchat,
          How is it reflecting to non-members? </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">But wait....Still not done....
          </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Remember Hoffy coming into
          Mistmoor the other day...? I asked if you had room for another?
          Your Reply. &quot;Yes, we have a slot open, but we have 3 Druids
          already. Not sure if we want another...&quot;.  Remember this?
          I then went into camo mode. You were with, hmm...honestly cat
          remember, With AoD or Combine....cant remember which one. Anyways....the
          point being....you turned Hoffy down....you were in there and
          saw Hoffy advertise for a good 30 minutes for a group....You
          never gave another reply. </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Ringing any bells now....?
          </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">There are a few others...but
          these will suffice. As for, your comment of &quot;What really
          has perturbed me about this whole situation is that NO ONE ever
          mentioned a bit that I may not be doing things as you wished.&quot;,
          Correct me if I'm wrong here, but didnt I, for the last 3-4 weeks,
          hound people about the changes going to<BR>
          be made? Did I not hound people about grouping with the guild?
          Didn't Korfallen warn people about this? In your own words...&quot;I
          have been at every guild meeting that I can remember...&quot;,
          So you knew of everything that I have said so far. So again,
          your comment of, &quot;but if I'm not living up to your satisfactions,
          wouldn't TELLING ME be a good idea instead of just kicking me
          out...&quot;, really has no baring here. You are a graon man.
          Part of the reason for the age limit within our ranks....so the
          leadership doesnt have to micro-manage you. People get upset
          if they are micro-managed. You know this. </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Now, to the meat of your letter
          to me....I was going to have a talk with you...becuase of the
          beginning of your letter to me. However, once I got to the bottom,
          I have to say, this is what I expected from you. You are forcing
          my hand. And as you well know, I will not back down. So, I will
          hold to my belief. You will remain out of CR. Although, we will
          still like to have you as a friend, it is my belief that you
          are not suited for what we are trying to do here. It falls on
          no ones shoulders but my own. No one is to blame but me for this
          decision. I have spent 5 years getting this guild where it is
          now, there are many people within EQ that know how we are, and
          know what we are about. Your threats to me, to this guild, and
          lastly, to it's members, do not worry me. I am trully sorry you
          feel you have to resort to these measures,<BR>
          but we have dealt with disgruntled ex-members before, and I am
          afraid to say, we will deal with them in the future as well.
          </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Reading the last paragraph,
          made me think, mayhaps, we are better without you in CR. But
          again, I could be wrong. And I am open to hear more on this.
          But understand this well, Rogan. Your threats to me is not what
          prompted me to respond. What prompted me to respond was the closed
          mindedness with which you are showing here. To think that I would
          just one day, out of the blue, kick someone out of the guild
          on a whim. And to think, that you could be as arrogant to think,
          that you have done nothing to spur this action? I think you know
          me better then that. :( </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">Rogan, times come, and times
          go. You stated, &quot;I will let people know that you are intending
          to turn Crimson Rose into Combine, which seems to be your current
          objective...&quot;, I must say, I whole-heartily disagree. We
          all know Combine, and what they are about. You know our policies,
          and what we are about. The words you speak to me, are words of
          anger, not reason. I urge you to rethink your words. Take some
          time away and think about this a bit. </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#009999" SIZE="-1">I am not angry at you. I dont
          hate you. And I hold no malice towards you at all. i trully wish
          things could be differant. Maybe they can in the future, who
          knows. </FONT></P>
