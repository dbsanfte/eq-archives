        awards that can be attained by members of The Crimson Rose. Some
        are difficult to get, while others are easy to recieve. In order
        to recieve an award here, one must nominate another fr the deed
        required for the award. That nomination goes before the members
        Baron for him to gather the needed information required for said
        member to recieve the award in question. Once the Baron agree's
        that the member nominated should recieve said award, the Baron
        will contact Duke Cirith for confirmation and thus the King or
        Queen will be informed. At the next guild meeting, the award
        will be presented to said member and will be posted for all to
        see his achievment.</FONT></P>
