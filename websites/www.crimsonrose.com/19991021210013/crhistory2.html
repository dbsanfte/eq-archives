            The thunderous voice shook the very earth itself, &quot;WHERE
            ARE YOU, YOU MAGGOT!&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;H..
            h... here m'lord&quot; Mayhem said stepping out of the shadows
            onto the red marble floor.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The room was
            filled with spectators as Mayhem stood in the middle of the throne
            room, all eyes upon him. As he went down to his knees he began
            looking about at his fellow brothers. The deamons looked back
            with joy in their eyes as they knew Mayhem had upset their lord,
            The Lord of Terror, Diablo.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A chill of
            fear shot from the back of Mayhem's neck down to his feet as
            he heard the sound of hoof beats on the stone approaching him.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;You
            trouble me child...&quot; Diablo spoke, looking down on Mayhems
            kneeling figure &quot;Why does the Council of Lords still live?&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Lord of
            Terror stood nearly twice as tall as a man and the smell of brimstone
            was enough to choke an unprepared soul. His hardened red shell
            of a body emitted waves of heat that began to overtake Mayhems
            senses.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;SPEAK!&quot;
            Diablo shouted causing Mayhem to jolt and small rocks from the
            ceiling to fall to the floor.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Many of the
            lesser deamons ran for cover from their Lords wrath, while others
            watched in almost blissful anticipation. Mayhem then looked up
            at his master.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;M...
            M.. Mandrake is no more, the castle lies in ruins and the living
            members have been scattered to the winds&quot; He stammered,
            &quot;What more could you possibly want?&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;WHAT
            DO I WANT?!?&quot; The Lord of Terror screamed.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Diablo then
            grabbed Mayhem by his cloak and held him high into the air dangling
            him in front of his face.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;...
            Their souls...&quot; Diablo said slowly, &quot;They have challenged
            my power now every last one of them shall die a thousand deaths
            by my hand.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mayhem grabbed
            for his neck, choked by his own cloak as he swung helpless in
            front of the Lord of Terror.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;You
            fail me one more time...&quot; Diablo then looked through Mayhem's
            eyes straight into his soul, &quot;and I shall make you dine
            on your own entrails.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With that
            Diablo threw Mayhem into the watching group of deamons. Like
            a ragged doll he flew through the air and landed in a heap crushing
            many of the minions.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Crush
            them, I don't care how many of us it takes. Just be sure they
            won't be able to stop you next time, for your sake.&quot; Diablo
            stated heading back into his chambers.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The crowds
            of deamons and murderers began to take there leave, magical gates
            began to open throughout the room. All but one man, who watched
            Mayhem in silence. The shrouded man eyed Mayhem as he talked
            to himself, taking careful note of what he said...</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Crush
            them?&quot; Mayhem said to himself, &quot;That would take a massive
            army, larger then the last. Only the Kriegers have a force that...&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A wicked smile
            came over Mayhem's face at that moment, as the revelation hit
            him.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Yes
            the Kriegers will do nicely...&quot; Mayhem said as he tossed
            his black cloak over his shoulders and faded into the shadows.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The shrouded
            figure watched in amusement as one of Diablo's warriors known
            as Mayhem was about to fall into a bloody mess that would for
            sure go over his head.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Perhaps
            this information could be useful,&quot; Kane said to himself,
            &quot;Most useful indeed...&quot; With that Kane rubbed the ruby
            amulet around his neck, magically took on the guise of a deamon
            and slowly began making his way back to the surface world.</FONT></B></P>

            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Gerin
            behind you!&quot; Lady Battlehawk shouted seeing a group of skeletons
            come behind the young warrior.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Thank
            you m'lady, I'll handle them,&quot; Gerin pulled his mace from
            his leather belt and approached the flimsy skeletons &quot;Die
            you foul creatures!&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Gerin engaged
            the whole troop of undead down the dark corridor. Bones could
            be heard scattering down the hallway as he drove his mace into
            the horde. Lady Battlehawk watched with a smile, knowing full
            well that even this inexperienced warrior could handle these
            foes, for she was around in case any of Diablo's Warriors showed
            tonight.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Glory
            to House Krieger! They were too easy!&quot; Gerin shouted down
            to Lady Battlehawk &quot;I could take on King Leoric himself!&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Bravo
            young warrior, bravo!&quot; Lady Battlehawk applauded, &quot;In

            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The clapping
            carried down the ancient hallway into the blackness. As the echo
            ended the sound of steel being drawn from a scabbard rang back
            down towards them.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;What
            was that?&quot; Gerin said nervously.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Hold
            Gerin, I'll investigate&quot; Lady Battlehawk stated as she peered
            down the web infested hallway.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;But..&quot;
            The young warrior didn't like the idea of a Lady defending him.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Shut
            your trap boy, it could be one of Diablo's&quot; Lady Battlehawk
            had no time to put up with this child, a glint of sweat shined
            on her forehead. &quot;If I tell you to run, you best do that
            and don't even look back.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Aye
            m'lady&quot; Gerin stated respecting her authority.</FONT></B></P>

            back into the shadows now, I'll be back&quot; She said moving
            towards the sound.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Gerin crouched
            down behind a decaying shrine watching Lady Battlehawk disappear
            into the darkness. His sense of safety shattered before his eyes
            as his he saw his own reflection staring back at him from the
            blade of a bloody sword.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;She

            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Gerin could
            see his frightened red-tinted image screaming back at himself
            in horror as the sword lifted for it's killing blow.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;ARHhhh...&quot;
            The bloody moans carried down the corridors.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;GERIN!?!&quot;
            Lady Battlehawk quickly spun around, &quot;GERIN!!!&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Lady Battlehawk
            had realized her mistake and came back running to the shrine
            where she had left her new warrior. She skidded to a halt at
            the bloody site. Gerin lay with his face in the shrine's red
            colored pool, his throat slit.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Oh Gerin...

            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Dantrag?!?
            What are you doing here?&quot; Lady Battlehawk stepped back confused,
