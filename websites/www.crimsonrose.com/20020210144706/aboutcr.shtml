	<b>What is the Crimson Rose?</b><BR>
	The Crimson Rose is an online role-playing guild for graphical
    MUD games based in fantasy settings. The guild was established
    during the glory days of &quot;<A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo"
    TARGET="_blank">Diablo (beta)</A>&quot; and moved on to the lands of
    Britannia for &quot;<A HREF="http://www.owo.com/" TARGET="_blank">Ultima
    Online (beta)</A>&quot;. Currently the guild is involved in Verant Interactive's 
    &quot;<A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/"
    TARGET="_blank">Everquest</A>&quot;, a massive multi-player fantasy
    online game based in the lands of Norrath. The guild is designed
    as a playing enviroment whereas a player can come and be free of k3VVL dOOdZ, profanity, 
    cheating and general lack of roleplaying that seems to be enveloping the MMOG gaming 
    community. Focused mainly on the Role-Playing of good character types, the guild is helpful 
    to all players in the actual game that are not rude, belligerent, known cheater/hacker or 
    k3VVL dOOdZ. The Crimson Rose is &quot;Anti-Player Killing&quot; for purpose of killing 
    for loot, though player killers are permitted into the guild for defensive purposes only
    but have their actions closely monitored as to keep the Crimson
    Rose's good name. Member or not, the Crimson Rose looks forward
    to meeting all role-players in game and sharing good times during
    our online gaming experience. We are currently exploring other games to become a multi-game
    guild and to expand our time online to more than one game theme. We encourage you to come 
    join us in this endeavor and explore the worlds we reside in to the fullest of your imagination.

	<b>I want to become a member!</b><BR>
    Good to hear! The Crimson Rose is always looking for valuable and mature members to add 
    to its membership. We do recommend that you read and understand the Rules and Laws of the 
    guild before you submit your application. Once you have read our guidelines, and agree 
    completely with them, send an email to 
    <a href="mailto:dantrag@crimsonrose.com">Dantrag/Rathmar</a>. You should receive a response 
    back from one of our officers no later than 72 hours after sending it in.<BR><BR>
	
	<b>Do you allow Evil Races?</b><BR>
	Yes, but only as long as the character "role-plays" him/her as a good-aligned person. Just 
	because a race has a bad reputation does not mean all members are the same. However, we 
	ARE a group of role players and you may have to "win" the respect of other members in 
	the guild.  This may lead to some excellent role-playing encounters as well. Elves and 
	Dark Elves just have a hard time getting along...<BR><BR>

	<b>Do you allow Evil Classes?</b><BR>
	Yes, providing they abide by the laws of the realm. These two classes may not be treated 
	with the best of terms based on the way the other classes role-play their character. But 
	that is part of the role-playing experience.<BR><BR>

	<b>What is the benefit of joining?</b><BR>
	Fun! We are a group of good friends who play for the enjoyment of the game. Protection 
	is also a major factor as well. Nothing gives you more pride than saving a member in 
	distress and receiving his or her gratitude as reward. We do not have specific level, 
	gear or other requirements to join our guild. We only expect that you be friendly and 
	are looking to have good clean fun. We look out for our own and try to ensure that all 
	members are having a great time!</b><BR>
