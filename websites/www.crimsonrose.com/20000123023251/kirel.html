    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">It was a day like any
        other. The day was warm and the sky blue. The midwife was in
        the room with Al'yana Arheldral. The Knight Rabuschka stood outside
        the birthing room, waiting for permission to come in. He winced
        at the screams that issued forth from Al`yana's mouth. Dimly,
        he heard a soothing voice give comfort to his wife. Suddenly,
        there was the mother of all screams. It turned to a whimper and
        then weeping. A gasp of delight was heard, along with the *snick*
        of a cutting tool. A sharp slap, followed by wailing. It was
        a pure sound, that wailing was. It was the sound of a baby. Not
        being able to wait any longer, the Knight strode into the room,
        face going white at all the blood. A hand supported him to a
        chair. He sat.<BR>
        &quot; Your son.&quot; Stated the wizened old woman as she handed
        him a bundle of rags. The Knight looked at the rags in puzzlement,
        then slowly moved back a portion with a heavy finger. &quot;Be
        careful &quot; commanded the old woman.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The Knight looked deep
        into his son's blue eyes. He turned toward his wife, she lay
        on her bed, in a pallor. She saw him looking and gazed lovingly
        back. &quot;This was a miracle &quot; he thought. My wife.. an
        elf, and I a Human. This doesn't happen much. He looked back
        into his sons eyes and said &quot; My son, you are a Noble One.
        &quot; Thus was named that day, Kirel Rabuschka..... The Noble
        One.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">When Kirel was five,
        and by all accounts a precocious child, his Aunt, Tira Arheldral
        came to visit. She was to marry Relik Sol`Nari. He was Earl of
        Sol Keep. When Tira and Al'yana stood together, it was impossible
        to tell the two apart. Both were tall, after the manner of the
        elves, and both had flowing blonde hair. Tira looked at Kirel
        like the son that she wanted. She hoped that her children would
        be as beautiful. However, she was not too hopeful, for Elves
        have children seldomly. In fact, she and her sister, had been
        the talk of the Elders. It was the second time in 4000 years
        that twins had been born into the Elven community.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">When Tira left, she bade
        Rabuschka and Al`yana to let Kirel come to court with her. She
        wanted Kirel to grow up, within a Noble house. Reluctantly, Rabuschka
        agreed. In some ways, it was fortuitous that Kirel left with
        his aunt, for less than 6 cycles of the moon went by, and the
        villa was raided by Trolls.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; Lady, wake up.&quot;
        The chambermaid said as she shook Lady Al`yana. &quot; Torches
        approach. &quot;Al`yana woke with a start, she looked around
        at her maids, and saw the angry orange glow reflecting from the
        brass frame on the window. She ran to the window, and looked
        out. &quot;Trolls. &quot; she hisses. &quot; Quickly, my Armor
        and my bow.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The maids ran from the
        room, down to the armory. Meanwhile the alarm bell started to
        ring. Al`yana, still in her night robe, ran to the main hall.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; Ware &quot; she
        cried. &quot; Trolls come! &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The arms men and women
        stopped near the gates.. &quot; Lady, shall we close the gates?
        &quot; shouted one man.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">She glanced up with dismay..
        &quot; Aye, close the gates, and man the wall. &quot; she commanded.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Her maids had her armor,
        so she stripped out of her robe, and into the black leather.
        she settled the helm of virtue upon her head, and grabbed her
        bow. It was a bow made by the famous elven bow maker, Trellhaki`melliael.
        They were hard to pull even for the strongest human ranger, but
        Al`yana had trained all her life. She was a Bowmistress, and
        battle hardened.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Al`yana strode to the
        top of the wall, and cried challenge. &quot; Why have you come?
        &quot; she called?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; Nub gruk lat?
        We Klomp you! &quot; Cried an especially ugly Troll.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Al`yana prayed hard,
        then and there, she then signaled to her protectors. &quot; Calhar
        Andean ! &quot; she screamed as her arrow flashed through the
        darkness to slam into the Trolls eye. Scores of arrows followed
        hers. The Trolls charged. They had the numbers, but Al`yana Rabuschka`Nari
        and her soldiers had the skill. Al`yana led the countercharge.
        Al`yana was killed.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Rabuschka, having been
        away, fighting for his king, heard the news, and fell to his
        knees in grief. He rose, with one thing in mind. Revenge. He
        broke oath, and left his king, on the battlefield. He rode his
        Warhorse to the nearest Troll village, and wreaked havoc until
        he was brought down. As a result of his actions, King Gryfonsbane
        was killed. His young son, Dantrag, took the throne, and the
        Dowager queen, left to her estates. Dantrag was mentored by several
        Nobles in the art ofrulership.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Kirel, heard of his parents
        death and went to the local shrine. There he swore several things.
        He took blood oath to never betray his king, and to serve. He
        thought that perhaps.. one day.. his name would be cleared of
        the dishonor that had befallen his name. Little did he know,
        that the new king, had pardoned his father mia culpa.. Thus Kirel's
        course was set. He would become a paladin. <BR>
        </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">After receiving his sword,
        Kirel turned to his cousin, Jenna, and smiled. &quot; I will
        name him Carrion. &quot; he pronounced. Jenna's cheeks dimpled
        at hidden pleasure as she laughed. &quot; Rosie.. &quot; she
        kissed her blade. Then, in apparent glee, she launched an attack
        at Kirel..</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Back and forth, metal
        clashed on metal. Kirel threw himself forward, arcing Carrion
        high, while Rosie undercut the blade and forced it over her head.
        She quickly reversed and Rosie flew at Kirel's stomach. Blade
        still high, Kirel dropped to the ground and rolled, letting Carrion
        catch Rosie. Using the force of her blade, Kirel spun on the
        ground and kicked out with his feet. Jenna tumbled. Kirel laughingly
        launched himself on her, and wrestled Rosie away. It was then
        that the King first saw both Kirel and Jenna. The king put finger
        to mouth, and Kirel understanding, said nothing. The king and
        his attendants, whisked away.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; My Lady, &quot;
        began Kirel, &quot; here is your noble blade.&quot; Jenna received
        Rosie, hilt first, with a curtsy.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Day's later, the young
        Kirel received a call from the chamberlain.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; Ser, your presence
        is requested at the Castle. &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Kirel ran strait through
        the doors, heading up through the courtyard, and into the main
        hall. At the massive doors, he stopped and straightened his tunic.
        He nodded to the herald.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">*BOOM* the heralds staff
        struck the floor. &quot; Master Kirel, knight in training &quot;
        he announced.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Kirel entered the chamber.
        Near the dias, he stopped, and kneeled, one hand on Carrion's
        hilt, the other, knuckles to the floor. * he had picked this
        effection up from the kings personal guards * &quot; My Lord,
        you required my presence? &quot; Kirel asked, head bowed.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Jenna's father, Earl
        Relik smiled at his foster son. &quot; Rise Kirel. &quot; he
        commanded.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Kirel rose up, to stand
        proudly before his Uncle.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; You have corrupted
        my daughter, &quot; began the earl. &quot; She wishes to become
        a Paladin. &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">At hearing the word &quot;
        corrupted &quot; Kirel turned green.. then when he heard the
        rest of the sentence, he laughed out loud. &quot; Hahahahh...&quot;
        Kirel snorted, &quot; I didn't corrupt her &quot; he snickered
        while raising his arm. &quot; You did. &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The Earls wife, Tira,
        a countess in her own right, nodded. &quot; True, dear.. so very
        true..&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Earl Relik glared at
        his wife. &quot; Who asked you? &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">She answered. &quot;
        Why.. you did, my love.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Kirel, watching this
        display, silently composed himself. Then without thought, mused
        out loud. &quot; But she is bloody good at swordplay.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Now both glared at him.
<BR>
<BR>
        The end result of that little encounter, was the &quot;punishment&quot;
        of his life.. Very likely, it actually saved him from death.
        He was sent to a monastery, to learn more about his god, while
        at the same time, learning some of the skills that he would later
        use as a paladin. Naturally, he exceeded at his training. Some
        years went by, idyllically spent riding horses, crossing swords
        with the best battle monks this side of Qeynos and learning how
        to pray healing on someone.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Kirel, grew a little
        restless, so he bid the monks farewell. He traveled home, to
        the little villa where he was born. Once there, he discovered
        that the staff had returned and held him as master. Much to his
        surprise, he even discovered the secured of his family. It seems
        that knight Rabuschka ( his father ) had really been a Paladin
        of the Highest Order. He was called, RedHand. In a musty chest,
        Kirel pulled out a banner. It was dead-night black, with a blazing
        blood red hand upon it. Kirel knelt and prayed. The banner started
        to glow, and the dust melted off. Then Kirel noticed that his
        own cloak was crumbling to dust. Quickly, Kirel stood up, and
        grabbed at the banner, which was now floating. The banner lost
        its glow. A servant had seen the entire incident, and stood there
        trembling. He kept saying.. &quot; the RedHand has returned.....
        the RedHand has returned.... &quot; then he fled from the room.
        Kirel, not knowing what to do, set the banner down and went for
        a ride.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">When he returned, the
        banner flew from the bell tower at the top of the Villa. All
        the servants had adopted clothes of black. Each one had a little
        red hand sewn to the right arm. They called him RedHand... Paladin
        RedHand, traveled to Sol Keep, with several arms men. He was
        re-united with his cousin. Now a woman of 17. She was the most
        beautiful creature that he had ever seen, but he could not think
        of her any other way than as his little cousin. Soon, he left
        for Rose Castle, the seat of the Crimson Kingdom. It was his
        intent, to present himself there for service. Along the way,
        he and his men were attacked by bandits. They dispatched the
        bandits with ease.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">As they were entering
        the city, they noticed that flags of grey... grey for mourning
        ... hung everywhere. Gossip in the streets, said that a trusted
        member of the high council had died. Determined to help, RedHand
        rode on. At the Palace gates, Kirel dismounted. He went to the
        trustle, and was surprised to be met by a man, like himself,
        dressed in black.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The man was somewhat
        mysterious... he introduced himself as Tanshiver. Tanshiver brought
        the paladin strait to the king. He took RedHand, to a room, with
        nothing but 4 walls and 3 chairs. The King, seemed somewhat youngish,
        and Tanshiver was a hardened man. The King and Tanshiver grilled
        him for hours.... or so it seemed.. The Paladin RedHand, not
        knowing what he had done to deserve this, was growing impatient
        when the King announced. &quot; Enough! &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; Kneel &quot; commanded
        King Dantrag Gryfonsbane.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Paladin RedHand kneeled
        in the manner of the Kings Guards.. Right hand on hilt, left..
        knuckles to the floor.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Tanshiver stood back,
        slightly amused.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The King that day, accepted
        the most holy vows from RedHands lips. Paladin RedHand, was now
        a member of court. <BR>
        Soon, Tanshiver ( who was the Inquisitor of the Realm ) had to
        leave on a personal journey. The king after deliberation, took
        Paladin RedHand aside, and asked him to fill the position. Not
        knowing much about politics or the enforcement of the law, RedHand
        expressed his doubts, but accepted the duty.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Soon thereafter, came
        word for the Inquisitor, that an attack was being made ready
        against Sol Keep. Paladin RedHand, now the Inquisitor, made this
        known to the King, and rode forth to warn Earl Relik. That first
        night, the King caught up while Kirel wept at the news of the
        death of Tira and Relik. He brought the Holy Order of the Thorn
        with him. All experienced warriors, the Thorn rode like the wind.
        They rode by the Inquisitor's villa, only to discover Lady Jenna
        within.. She was hurt. RedHand, stopped to nurse his cousin back
        to health, while the King and Thorn rode forth to destroy the
        invading army.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">After making sure that
        the Thorn had things well in hand, the King left for his keep.
        RedHand as the Inquisitor of the Realm, had the Baron Althor
        Kivan, executed for his crimes against the Sol'Nari family and
        the Crown. RedHand stayed near his villa, while the Lady Jenna
        convelesed, and was brought back to full health. Soon, they set
        out, in little night raids, to kill all of the bandits that they
        could find. Kirel taught her all that he could in the arts of
        the Paladin. She soon surpassed his skill in healing others.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The Inquisitor, instructed
        by the king, helped the Lady Jenna to re-build Sol Keep. They
        instituted the creation of some secret passages that are only
        known to them. Then, when the Keep was nearing completion, summons
        came. The King wished to see the Paladin, Lady Jenna. After her
        surprising visit to Rose Castle, Baroness Jenna rode back to
        Sol Keep, with the Thorn at her side. She now commanded that
        division. Meanwhile, theInquisitor stayed with the King.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Months went by, and the
        King, aching for the beauty of Lady Jenna, took the Inquisitor
        with him, and went to visit Sol Keep and the Lady. Jenna, radiantly
        beautiful, accepted the kings proposal of marriage. Kirel smiled
        at the union. Even though pressing security matters kept him
        away, he wished his cousin happiness. He had grown to love the
        King as a brother, and he already loved the new queen like a
        sister. The Inquisitor grew ever more diligent in his passion
        for the safety of his beloved cousin.</FONT></P>

        his sword and arcs it toward the miscreant in front of him. On

        life. The Paladin sighs. &quot; hwwwwwh&quot; He then turned

        to make sure that his surcoat was donned properly. He cannot
        help but remember his father as he examines the field of black
        with a bloody red hand imprinted on it. Knowing that he must
        do battle, a battle of a kind which he passionately dislikes,

        As he starts toward the chamber doors, he stops. His black cloak

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Those same passions drove
        him to do things which were not entirely ethical, but in his
        fervor and zeal, he didn't notice. However the Queen, and King
        did. One day, the Inquisitor sent several of his operatives into
        the field on a dangerous mission. The result, the death of a
        beloved member of the court.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; Sir! &quot; a
        page called from down the hall. &quot; Lord RedHand, this just
        came for you. The page handed the paladin a vellum wrapped container.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; What type of bird?
        &quot; the RedHand asked.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; A raven. &quot;
        answered the page without thinking. He appended with &quot; Sir
        &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The Lord Inquisitor,
        clasped the container in his hand.. &quot; A note.. but from
        whom...&quot; he wondered out loud. &quot; Go now, &quot; he
        commanded, &quot; Fetch the Arch-Bishop, Lord Crascis. Tell him,
        that.... an old friend, has come to visit.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The page scrambled off,
        down the hallway. RedHand turned and walked toward his chambers.
        Inside, he cracked the vellum, and slipped the cap off the bone
        container. Hesitation filled his bones. He decided to wait, and
        with a grunt, heaved himself off the chair, over to the cabinet.
        He slipped out two glasses, and filled them both with an amber
        liquid. He slowly tasted his, letting the warmth slide down his
        throat while waiting for the Frater to arrive.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The page slipped his
        head in. &quot;Sir, his Holiness is here.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot;Show him in!&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot;Aye sir!&quot;
        the page bobbed his head, and withdrew.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">In walked light incarnate.
        A tall man, dark hair, face aglow and with a ready and warm smile.
        &quot; Good morning to you.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot;And to you as well..
        brother.&quot; RedHand replied, he motioned toward a seat. &quot;
        Please, take your ease.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Crascis Lightborn sat.
        With a look of pure bliss, he reached for the glass that RedHand,
        was holding forth. After taking a long drink, he asked. &quot;
        Why was the page sent? &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The Lord Inquisitor crossed
        the room, reached down to a small desk, and picked up the bone
        container. &quot; This..&quot; he started. After crossing the
        room again, he placed the container in Crasciss' waiting hands.
        &quot; This came in today.. by raven.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The glass slid from the
        Arch-bishops fingers, and shattered on the marble floor. He closed
        his eyes. Prayers for the dead issued forth from his lips. Then,
        lips near white, he opened them. &quot; Who? &quot; he asked,
        voice ragged.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The paladin, gently laid
        his hand on the frater's shoulder. &quot; I don't yet know. But
        I needed you here, for I fear grave news indeed is within this
        container. &quot; I ask that you first bless this, so that any
        traps are canceled. &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">His Holiness, Crascis
        Lightborn, knelt. His white robes now stained amber as he knelt
        within the puddle caused by the dropped glass. He first attained
        proper state, by chanting for a minute, then he called out to
        his god. A faint blue light enveloped him, just for a moment,
        healing the cuts in his knee.. The gods are kind to their servants...
        Then the vellum wrapped bone container, flashed a deep red, then
        focused into a deep residing blue. The glow disappeared and Crascis
        rose. &quot; Here. &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">He handed the container
        to the Lord Inquisitor.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Standing, the Paladin
        RedHand, stuck his finger into the container, and withdrew a
        slip of paper. He slowly opened it, all the while looking at
        Crasciss, and seeing the Frater look back. RedHand, read what
        the note contained, and a moan escaped his lips. &quot; Nooooo
        &quot; he looked crushed.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The Frater ripped the
        note from RedHands clenched fist, and read the note. &quot; Dear
        God,... O Sy`lana.. Sy`lana..&quot; The arch-bishop wept.</FONT></P>

        days pass)...</FONT></I></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The entire castle is
        bedecked in mourning grey. The mood in the courtyard is somber
        and bleak. In the center of the courtyard, a newly created statue
        rises. A du-plex statue, one side showing a warrior woman, in
        battle armor, and a snarl upon her lips, the other, depicting
        a woman of beauty and grace. A woman with a ready smile. Both
        depiction's were of..... a friend.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">A tent had been erected
        to cover the still form of the Arch-bishop. He lay as he had
        for 3 days now, clothes rent, ashes in his hair, and tears, even
        still cascading down his face. Beside him sat Amen-Ra, the Queen,
        and countless others, all dressed in grey. Some wore silk, others
        wore wool and cotton.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The King entered the
        courtyard, none but the royal chancellor and the inquisitor noticed
        his entry. He swept down to the statue, and ran his fingers over
        its stony face. He stood their for countless minutes, tears streaming.
        He whispered... &quot; Good-bye Sy`lana qua Croix, fare you well
        on your new journey. &quot; Voice now ragged, and grief evident,
        he paused, then finished.&quot; Good-bye my friend, we all will
        miss you.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">As a result of this,
        the Inquisitor resigned post. He simply wanted to guard the Queen,
        his Queen, his cousin. Deep in council, the King and Queen met
        with the nobles of the land. They determined that truly, the
        Inquisitor was not at fault. The Queen expressed desire to make
        her cousin happy once more. She decided that she would give up
        the Barony of Sol'Nari and the command of the Thorn, to Kirel
        Rabuschka.. the RedHand. ......</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Several years later...
        the Redhand grew careless once again. He went in search of the
        Arch-Bishop and told of his sins. The Arch-bishop blessed him,
        but the sin was to grevious for simple absolutions. Kirel needed
        to speak with Karana. As the days past, Baron Kirel Redhand desperatly
        sought the calm places of the land. Seeking succor, he found
        none. After many days of searching, he ran to the altar of Karana.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; Most High Lord
        of the Thunder. I have sinned against my fellow man, against
        my king and against you. I swear to sit here until you answer
        me. I need to know what I must do to be absolved of this crime.
        &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Kirel knelt and wept
        before the altar.. waiting upon an answer. For 20 days and 20
        nights he stayed in one spot. His armor grew dusty and Carrion
        ceased to sing. The Bishops and monks of the abbey tried to move
        him but he seemed rooted to the very stone. King Dantrag and
        Queen Jenna both came to stand vigil with the Redhand. Upon the
        21st day, as the sun rose in the east and the darkness of night
        receeded into the dark, a bolt of pure sound struck Kirel.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; MY SON, INDEED
        MY DISPLEASURE IS GREAT. I COMMAND YOU TO FORSAKE ALL VOWS AND
        TO WANDER THE BREDTH OF THE LAND. IF YOU OBEY, THEN WILL I MAKE
        KNOWN MY WILL.&quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Kirel was broken hearted.
        He had been commanded by his God to break oath with his King
        and his Queen. He had been commanded to disavow the Barony which
        he had worked so hard for and the Kingdom in which he had spilled
        hearts blood to cleanse. Kirel rose, washed and commanded the
        servants to polish his armor. He took Carrion with him and washed
        Carrion in the most precious oils. Dawning his council robes,
        Kirel affixed his blood red hand insigna to the back and strode
        into the council chambers where the King was giving audiance.
        Kirel pushed all the petitioners aside and spoke directly to
        the King and Queen.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; Sire, my Lady...
        I have been commanded to leave you. &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The King's mouth opened.
        Never in Dantrag's wildest imaginings had he thought that Kirel
        Redhand would say that. The Queen openly wept.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; I beg your forgiveness.
        I know not whence I will return. I hope to one day serve the
        Rose again. But for now, I must leave. &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">With that, the Redhand
        tore off his council robes and strode out of the Hall. The guards
        moved to stop him but the King waved them away. Kirel strode
        off into the wilderness.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Several months later,
        a ragged haired man in shining armor steped into an inn of the
        name, the Vulgar Unicorn. There, dripping water from the heavy
        storm outside, he stripped his armor off, took Carrion and laid
        it atop the pile and looked up at his old friend Tanshiver with
        madness filled eyes. Tanshiver moved to help his friend when
        Kirel whipped out his dagger and crying JUSTICE!!!!!!.. plunged
        it deep into his heart. As he topled over, the blood begining
        to pool, Tanshiver called for his healers.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Suddenly the rain outside
        stopped and the brightest bolt of lightning ever seen in Norrath
        slammed to the ground ( inside the tavern ). There, glowing with
        power was Karana himself.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">&quot; SON, BECAUSE OF
        YOUR STEADFAST DEVOTION TO ME, FORSAKING ALL OTHERS AND BECOMING
        MY CREATURE, I AM WELL PLEASED IN YOU. RISE NOW,<BR>
        BE WELL AND FULL OF MY GRACE AND LOVE. GO AND SHOW SUCH MERCY
        AND GRACE TO ALL WHOM YOU ENCOUNTER . &quot;</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">A blue nimbus of light
        surrounded the man known as Kirel. His features had changed,
        in a suble way. No longer did he look elven, but human wholy.
        Kirel looked around him and cried out the only thing that came
        to his mind. &quot; CARAI EN ELLISANDE, VAR ANDEAN CEUBYAIR,
        SO`JHIN ANDEAN VAR KISEIRI CRIMSONROSE &quot; ( translated that
        means...Glory to the Rose of the Sun. Guardian of the Heart of
        the Rose, Servant of the Rose and Guardian of the Brotherhood
        Crimson Rose. )</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Kirel, sound of heart,
        body, soul and mind made his way back to the lands of the Rose
        and contacted the Chancellor. He knew that he would no longer
        be able to lead men, for he now knew his true calling. He was
        to be a servant of the King... a servant of the Kingdom ,,,,
        a servant of all... a Servant of the Rose.</FONT></P>
