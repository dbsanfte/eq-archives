<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hi...I am another of Aventra's daughters, but usually my sister (Aamana) has played this Llassie character.  "Aamana" asked me to post that yesterday, Aventra slipped into a coma!  Dr's believe it may have been induced by a massive infection running rampant in her system.  Prayers and focused thoughts are appreciated!  Having glanced at some postings on your board (although I felt like a peeping Tom), I can see why "Aventra", and now Aamana are so in awe of Crimson Rose!  May your higher powers, gods, spirits, whatever... see fit to grace "Aventra" with another day, as she graces everyones' lives that she touches!  Bless you, Crimson Rose, all!</FONT>
