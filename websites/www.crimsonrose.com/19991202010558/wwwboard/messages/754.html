<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">...has FINALLY been posted and can be accessed by clicking on her name on the members page, (as with other members who are shaded).  I wish she could have been able to see that it was finally linked, for I know that she, Korfallen and Cairbre worked long and hard on theirs.  It was an exciting group effort unlike any I have ever witnessed before.  And was the precursor to the long running saga that they had going on the board.  Think they could have made a novel of it!<br>Enjoy it, please!  For I know that was Aventra's, Korfallen and Cairbre's intent...to provide some fun and history for their CR family.</FONT>
