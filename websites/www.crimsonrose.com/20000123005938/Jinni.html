        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Jinni Silverwing<BR>
                ...coming over a small ridge on her way to the Greater
        Faydark, the Faeiry Cortier saw a broken cart and bundles of
        wasp wings on the path with  two young Woodelves dead nearby.
        They were obviously Druids, one male and one female, their scimitars
        bloodied and lying on the ground, one broken. &quot;What is this
        she thought? They must have been victims of a bandit attack,
        or worse...&quot;Noting the location so she could send a burial
        detail out, the Courtier started to leave when she heard a small
        squeak from the pile of bundles. Moving one bundle, she discovered
        a child, wrapped in a wolf-hide cape, the Courtier returned to
        the Faeiry  town and presented the child to the Princess, saying
        &quot;milady, the child's parents were slain, I was not able
        to find any identification other than the scimitar's carried
        by her parents, Gypsy crafted Combine Scimitar's from the land
        of Oasis.&quot; The Princess said &quot;Ahhh, Druids...I have
        many friends from the Woodelf city, I will inquire to the leaders
        there about the child, perhaps she has relatives there. In the
        meantime, as the child has not a name, I shall name her Jinni,
        which means &#145;magic one'.&quot;<BR>
                The leaders from Kelethin had finally, after a long silence,
        sent a pigeon to the Princess saying that the child had no other
        relatives and that the leaders would place the child into the
        orphanage. The Princess had grow fond of the blond haired, blue
        eyed child, and sent word to the leaders in Kelethin that the
        child would remain in her care. Jinni grew into a strong, bold
         young elf, and having been tutored in the Druid ways at the
        order of the Princess,  had developed strong spell casting powers.
        She said, &quot;Princess, I am ready to travel our land...I want
        to discover the world!&quot; The request was accepted with a
        smile from the Princess, who then held a &#145;coming of age
        party' for Jinni, and announced to all that henceforth, Jinni
        would have the surname Silverwing, the Princess's royal name,
        then handed her the lone remaining scimitar that the Cortier
        had brought from the site of her parents death. &quot;Take care
        Jinni, and may Tunare watch over you, young Druidess.&quot; Watching
        Jinni walk among the mushroom fields, the Courtier thought, &quot;did
        the Princess always plan to give this...this......ELF,  the royal
        name of Silverwing?&quot; Shaking her head, the Courtier looked
        at Jinni with jealous envy. <BR>
        Jinni began traveling over all of Norrath, meeting and helping
        many peoples. She thought &quot;I must search out a group that
        has made evil their enemy...I know I can help them fight.&quot;
        One day while battling Skeleton Pawns at the &quot;chessboard&quot;
        in the Butcherblock  Mountains, she met Kingdantrag and his Queen
        Jenna; they accepted her into their group and soon became friends.
        Many meetings of the three occurred and then one day, Cirith,
        the Duke of the Crimson Rose, asked Jinni &quot;why don't you
        join the Rose?  When approached, the King was overjoyed, and
        shouted to all &quot; Jinni, welcome into the CRIMSON ROSE!!!&quot;.</FONT></P>
