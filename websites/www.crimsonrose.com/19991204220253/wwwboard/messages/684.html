: *I dedicate this discourse to Aventra...&quot;In truth may we find life...In life may we find beliefs...And in Belief may we find the Truth...&quot;*

: Scavenger.  Aye, a lad you may have come to see in our land of Norrath, our land of 2nd recital, our Otherworld of hope...

: It was a during a wee bit of time past that I first had the inopportunity to meet this lad in the desert of Northern Ro.  Always a blabbering idiot, he went on and on about nonsensical details that made sense to noone but himself.  He was, to be in a most plain sense of reasoning, a pain in the tuckous.

: And he still is.

: Way back then, as I was getting to understand how insignificant his ramblings were, I encountered him in that same desert of Ro through his usual shouts of self-proclaimed glory.

: But on one particular evening, as the sun was setting, he performed a most grievous action...He became racially biased.

: There was, that evening, a couple of folks who were discussing the Asian languages, and how perhaps there might be, one day, a day when the Deities of Norrath would allow those who did not know languages such as Chinese and Taiwanese to understand them, with little effort on their part, in this new land.

: It was then that Scavenger started mocking that ancient dialect, with infantile soundings such as &quot;Ew chay yung tum yung fung..&quot;, etc.  You get the idea.

: This was received very poorly by the folks in that particular &quot;zone&quot; of the world, and after a few terse remarks to him, Scavenger came back and apologized about it, because he was at the time, as he said, &quot;Drunk and tired and not knowing who I have offended.&quot;

: Of course, he was also drunk and tired as he made this half-hearted apology, for it was not more than 30 minutes later that he typed this...

: &quot;Perhaps we should all speak Chinese, so we don't have to learn English!&quot;, or some such nonesense.

: And so we spin the History dials a bit forward, to this evening in Oasis, where Scavenger became miffed about something, and shouted the F word to the public /shout channel in a very personal manner, with no regard to whom might be listening.  

: &quot;...Children?  Whatever.  People of sensitivity?  Who cares... I will say what I think, and damn to hell what they feel.&quot;

: Thus is the thinking of this Scavenger folk whom some of ye may have met, unfortunatley.

: Aakar already feels Scavenger's malicious feelings, which is why he rooted me on tonight.  Do not feel wonderment at his feelings, for if you were, or have been lately, present at one of Scavenger's outbursts, then you would understand why Aakar, and I, feel how we do when Scavenger cusses in a public channel.  

: 
: It was comical to see Scavenger shouting out that he had no idea what I was refering to when I rebuked to him of this troublesome time with him picking on Asians.  Aakar was present during Scavenger's latest tirade, mind you, so ye may know I am not making this stuff up.  Could I possibly be this imaginitive on my own?  Hehe.

: And I know, no...FEEL, why he is a stinky folk, and why he is one whom should be either ignored for his downright flatulent behavior, or laughed at for his supreme idiocy.

: At least, if we might try to find something positive in his antics, let us find humor and laughter.

: Heck, I do, and look at me.  I am not only the president of the Scavenger-heretical-laughter-society, I am also a client.

: :-)
