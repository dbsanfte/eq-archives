<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">: This custom-building super-computer isn't all its cracked up to be. I recieved the last of my parts today and have been working on my computer all night. Alas, many problems have been popping up. Setting up the motherboard, fun stuff, let me tell you. Well, finished putting everything together...I THOUGHT...and when the on button was pressed...beep, CD-ROM check...and behold, nothing showed on screen, the hard drive light stayed on, and the power button wasn't shutting off the computer. Hmph. With a little luck and elbow grease I should have it up in time tomarrow to finally see Star Wars and spend all night relearning how to play EverQuest. *Laughs* More problems, I found the screw holes in my Hard Drive stripped, had to hold it in with super glue on the screws. *Shakes head* All I can say is I'll be the happiest man alive when it's finished. Finally I have the kick-arse computer I always wanted. Now I wish I had the kick-arse computer I always wanted running. Good hunting, see you soon!<p>I've run into this problem building computers many times before.  Having all IDE drives not show up, and the light not turn off is due to having the IDE cable upside-down on one of the drives.  Flip the cable on your CD-ROM or hard drive, and try again.<p>Whatever you do, just don't get mad at the computer and chuck it out the window, it doesn't make things any better :)<p>Sir Rogan Almot<br>Knight of Truth<p><br></FONT>
