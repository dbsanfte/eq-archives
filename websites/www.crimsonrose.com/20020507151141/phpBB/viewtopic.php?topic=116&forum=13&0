<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">CR Mission Statement <BR>We, the Members of the The Crimson Rose, in Order to form a more perfect Guild, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Good to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Membership of The Crimson Rose. <BR><BR>Here is an outline for members and potential members of The Crimson Rose (i.e. Order of Rathmar). These guidelines are to be strictly adhered to. If you think you will not be able to accommodate ANY of these mandates I have set forth, it would be productive for you as well as the guild that you de-tag yourself now. For failure to abide by these will result in disciplinary action against you by myself (Rathmar) and/or the officers of the guild. <BR><BR>Paragraph I, The CR Tribunal <BR>Section 1 <BR>Clause 1: All Noble Powers herein granted, shall be vested in a Tribunal of The Crimson Rose, which shall consist of prominent members (officers) chosen by the Guildmaster (herein shall be notated as GM). The Tribunal will be coordinated by a Lord Inquisitor (chosen by the GM). Tribunal members may, during a Tribunal meeting, present proposals for approval by the Tribunal to the Lord Inquisitor (officer chosen by the GM), in writing, before a meeting. Any member, Tribunal Member or the Lower House may issue a proposal for review to the Tribunal. The Lord Inquisitor will appoint an Sergeant at Arms to help administer the meetings and proposals. <BR><BR>Clause 2: During meetings scheduled and led by the Lord Inquisitor, the proposals will be presented, discussed, and then voted on by the Tribunal. The GM may attend and vote on presented proposals. If a proposal is passed, it is recorded and moves to the GM for final approval. If the GM approves it, it becomes Law. If the GM veto's it, it is returned to the Tribunal for review. If three-quarters of the Tribunal vote for it again, and the GM also votes for it, the GM's veto is overridden and the proposal becomes Law. <BR><BR>Clause 3: The Tribunal will decide on meeting times and lengths. Meetings may proceed even when Tribunal members are absent, if the Lord Inquisitor concurs that the said meeting should continue. In a veto override vote, all Tribunal members must be present. <BR><BR>Clause 4: The Tribunal Proposal to Law Procedure Summary and Protocol; <BR>a) A Member contacts a Tribunal Member of his choice and shares an idea for a proposal. Or a Tribunal Member creates an idea himself that is worthy of a Tribunal Proposal. b) The Tribunal Member writes the idea in Proposal forum. d) The outcome of the vote on the proposal will be posted on the main news web page. It will be added to the Constitution. <BR>Section 2 <BR>Clause 1: The Tribunal shall be composed of Members chosen by the GM or Lord Inquisitor. <BR><BR>Clause 2: No Person shall be a Tribunal Member who has not attained good social standing, not in a leadership position or been a member for less then three(3) months. <BR><BR>Clause 3: A Tribunal Members term is 1 year (unless forcibly removed). At that time, his position may be reviewed by the GM and/or Lord Inquisitor. <BR><BR>Clause 4: The GM and Lord Inquisitor can cast 2 votes each to over turn a tie vote. <BR>Section 3 <BR>Clause 1: The Tribunal shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members. A majority shall constitute a quorum to do Business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as the Tribunal may provide. <BR><BR>Clause 2: The Tribunal may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the concurrence from the GM, expel a Tribunal or Guild Member. <BR><BR>Clause 3: The Tribunal shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time, publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment, require Secrecy. And the Yeas and Nays of the Members of the Tribunal on any question shall, at the desire of two thirds of those present, be entered in the Journal. <BR><BR>Clause 4: The Tribunal shall not adjourn for more than one week (as outside circumstances deem appropriate). <BR>Section 4 <BR>Clause 1: Every Proposal, which shall have passed by the Tribunal, shall, before it becomes a Law and is implemented, be presented to the GM. If he approves, he shall endorse it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to the Tribunal in which it originated, who shall enter the Objections at large in their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. <BR>Section 5 <BR>Clause 1: The Tribunal shall have Power To lay and collect Dues, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of The Crimson Rose. <BR><BR>Clause 2: To borrow Money on the credit of The Crimson Rose. <BR><BR>Clause 3: To regulate Commerce with foreign Guilds and organizations. <BR><BR>Clause 4: To establish a uniform Rules of Membership, and uniform Laws of conduct. <BR><BR>Clause 5: To hunt and provide for the Punishment of Guilds, Organizations, groups, and/or individuals who are guilty of Murder; <BR><BR>Clause 6: To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed in the worlds with which we reside, and Offences against the Laws of The Crimson Rose. <BR><BR>Clause 7: To declare War, grant Letters of Marquee and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water. <BR><BR>Clause 8: To raise and support Armies, to enforce The Crimson Rose's Laws and interests. <BR><BR>Clause 9: To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of these Armies (Rules of Engagement). <BR><BR>Clause 10: To provide for Members to execute the Laws of the Guild, suppress Insurrections and repel attacks. <BR><BR>Clause 11: To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of The Crimson Rose, or in any Department or Officer thereof. <BR>Section 6 <BR>Clause 1: No Single Member shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marquee and Reprisal, or create a Law save the GM and/or a majority vote of the Tribunal. <BR>Paragraph II, Guildmaster <BR>Section 1 <BR>Clause 1: The Guild Power shall be vested in a Guildmaster.
