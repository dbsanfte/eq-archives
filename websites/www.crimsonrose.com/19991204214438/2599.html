        We will see though. This is unconfirmed but is the talk in the

        characters to the non-test servers. If any of you get any info
        on this, please let me know so I can post it. The above servers

          Confirmation Codes - Those of you that have registered may not

          off this function alltogether.<BR>
          You won't need to wait for any confirmation codes. In fact, we
          won't be sending them at all.. so<BR>
          you will be able to register and play immediately. This DOES
          involve a client patch so you will<BR>
          need to download a few files.</FONT></I></B></P>
          <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">2)
          A few other server side errors - We've already fixed a couple
          of big ones that we have only<BR>
          seen since 20k people tried to get in at once. We believe we
          still have at least one more big one<BR>
          that we are tracking, so it's likely that this next update won't
          alleviate the problem.</FONT></I></B></P>
          <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">3)

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">It would appear that
        the time frame given by 989 was a bit premature. We are sitting
        at 2.5 hours after the &quot;release&quot; of P4 and still the
        servers are not up. I for one am a bit discouraged. Probably
        though, that I am 'itchy' to get in and play. But non-the-less,
        it is disheartening not to play at the time they said they would
        have it up. But having everyone try at once kinda puts a kink
        into things. Personally, I think that they are still working
        on it and did not get everything they needed to get done, done.
        People are complaining that they can not make accounts, can not
        validate thier accounts, and when, if by some sort of luck, they
        get to validate thier accounts, when they go to log on, they
        get booted to thier desktop. Hrm. Here is a response from the

            Depends what you mean by a 'virtual economy'. We have a 'player-driven
