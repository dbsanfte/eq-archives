<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Im keeping my name hidden because it is not the important issue here. A few of you will probably figure out who I am, so be it. I will also try not to name many people involved in the cases out of respect, they can come forth if they want. Cases?? yes,i have several incidents where the king seems to be corrupt.  Many of you wont even bother to read them, infact, this post might be deleted.  For those who read it, will it change your mind about Dantrag? My guess is no. You have made up your mind about the king before you even began to read this message.  You all are so eager to follow him blindly,like puppies, that you wont step back and look at it all. So why do i speak if my words land on deaf ears? I wanted the truth to be out there, to be presented. Ive tried to approach people in the past to help me speak, all of them cowered and didnt  help me. There are those in the guild who believe the same as me,but they wont speak out, they are comfartable where they are, even if it means following someone they really dont trust. So,now i present to you the things ive seen.<br>1. A certain member of the rose had given the king a nice weapon ( at the time), a shiny brass hally, to us for QUEST purposes. he next day that member saw dantrag using the halberd for himself.....which is fine....but the halberd was never used in a quest. So,what did happen to the halberd? The original owner doesnt know.<br>2. Another member asked dantrag to hold some items for him,blackened chain armor.  This member thought he could trust the king. When he returned to get his items, Dantrag had "lost" many pieces of the armor. He offered to help this member get the armor back. A week passed, 2, 3 ...a month....dantrag never even spoke of it after that. The member who identity is remained hidden had to go forth and get his own items back. He asked dantrag several time why he didnt help him,only to be ignored. When the king finally answered he just blew him off and told the member he had not aquired ANY black chain since that time,yet,the very next day dantrag was seen wearing the exact pieces he had "lost" a month before.<br>3.  Many of you remember infestus correct? Remember how he decided to quit, even after many of you tried to convince him not to? He gave his items to jinni and said his farewells.  Jinni gave the items to dantrag who promptly sold them for cash.  He didnt give any thought to the idea of infestus return wen he had cooled off ( he had quit because he was angered,enraged, about something). two or three days later infestus did return. Now,i dont agree with what festy did, but i dont agree what the king did either.  I spoke to the king and infestus at the same time,trying to make peace.  (you know who i am now Dan?) Dantrag would not give the cash to infestus. Why? it was only 200 pp. Is our guild so in need of money that we will take all that a young dwarf has? I pleaded with the king for over 3 hours to gve infestus his things back.  I could only get him to give half back.  A king is someone who should be caring, forgiving, and kind. Dantrag was mean, vengeful, and full of hate that night, to a man who really did him nothing.  They both acted like children. A king that acts like a child, do you really want to follow someone like that?<br>4. This goes to who ever said "why dont we blame people like giacomo who started in full bronze?" well,first of all,they dont hold the guild treasures. Even so, Giacomo started out with alot of bronze, which is costly,but not impossible. Dantrag has had multiple characters start in gear so expensive its not funny. On was a bard in almost a full set of STEEL plate. He was better equiped than Cairbre, a paladin who was so much higher than him.<br>5. This doesnt have to deal with the king, but to sale who said we should talk to our family, CR. CR isnt the family it was once was ( or perhaps i was just to foolish to see it was never one). When Aventra and LLassie died, all of you made your posts,giving grief, but most of you forgot the event a day later. How about Soth who was married to Llassie? Did you talk to him? Express your sorrow to him? Only 3 people did. But i am getting off the topic now.<br>        I am done now. Point and call me liar. Tell me these things arent important. Do what ever you must to keep faith in your king. But I ask..why? I've only come up with two reasons.  You either dont want to leave the guild because of friends in it...to this I say...You dont need a king. Disband and make your own group. Make a democracy. Dantrag did not invent the ideals of good, and he certainly doesnt follow them.  The other reason ive come up with. You are too attached to the king and dont want to leave him. To this i say, if you wish to follow a bad king, change your ways, You obviously dont care about upholding the virtue CR was s'pose to stand for. Dont claim to be good any longer. Ive kept quiet for so long, now i have spoken....the rest is up to you.<p>~the dark one</FONT>
