<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">a few things I'd like to clear up.

As for going on who word is better in the incidents, you are all right, except in the black chain, where I WAS present. You can call me a liar,call me any profane name you can think of, but do not call me evil. I fight for the same thing i fought for when i was in CR, I fight to unite all races in friendship.
