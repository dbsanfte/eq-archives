<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">I'd love to hit Najena. Maybe we could get some people some Jboots ;-) I also know several casters don't have FBR's. Let's see if we can't remedy that, as well. But... Saturday evening is not a good time for me, since Karsus and Hoffy and I will be occupied with our AD&D session. Perhaps Saturday early afternoon or late morning? Most everyone is ahead of us in the time zones anyway, so that should work fairly well. A bit of info for ya, my 13 lvl Troll SK did very well in Upper Najena, I dont see how anyone would be in peril if we had a lot of our higher level members accompany us down there. I'm a level 18 Ranger, so I'm not entirely helpless, but I wouldn't mind some help from Duncan, Cairbre, Hoffy, Amenra, Zaharian, Karsus, etc etc. Let's get the ball rolling! :)<p>Mandon Ashenwood<br>Ranger of Meilikki, Our Lady of the Forest<br></FONT>
