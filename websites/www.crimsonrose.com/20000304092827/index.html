          Shadowknights in addition to the other classes available to them.
          All Erudite Necromancers, Shadowknights, and Clerics who worship
          the God of Fear, Cazic-Thule, now start in the City of Paineel.
          As such, if you wish to create a character of this type from
          this point forward, you *must* download the Paineel zone-files
          via the Optional Patch. </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Please
          note that if you downloaded the Paineel zone files recently,

          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">- The
          recast delay for many of the Shaman buff-spells have been reduced.<BR>
          - &quot;Reoccurring Amnesia&quot; has had its casting time reduced.<BR>
          - &quot;Yaulp&quot; and &quot;Augmentation&quot; should now stack.<BR>
          - &quot;Solidarity of Vision&quot; has had its duration increased.<BR>
          - The Druid spell, &quot;Skin Like Nature&quot;, has been returned
          to its former status due to popular opinion. As such, the damage-shield
          component has been removed and the regeneration component has
          been re-applied.<BR>
          - &quot;Sense Magic&quot; has been replaced in all cases by the
          &quot;True North&quot; spell. If you have already inscribed the
          &quot;Sense Magic&quot; spell, the spell icon will now automatically
          reflect &quot;True North&quot;.<BR>
          - A bug that existed with several damage-shield spells, causing
          their damage to be subtracted rather than added when stacked,
          has been corrected. The spells will now stack properly.<BR>
          - The &quot;Feign Death&quot; spell, when cast by a Necromancer,
          will now have a fixed duration. The Necromancer will receive
          several warnings prior to the spell wearing off. This change
          was necessary because some Necromancers found a way to gain experience
          through their pet while being AFK for an extended duration, such
          as being in bed for the night. Note: This does not affect Shadowknights
          or Monks.<BR>
          - New Necromancer spells are now in game. Check your spell vendors.<BR>
          - Alchemy has been revamped. Check with your local Shaman.<BR>
          - DOT (Damage Over Time) spells will no longer hinder camping.

          reduce the difficulty of the zone. <BR>
          - All known issues with the SBLive soundcard have been corrected.
<BR>
          - From this point forward, deleting a character will cause all
          corpses belonging to that character to likewise be deleted. This
          change was made primarily to stop a no-drop transfer bug. It
          also has the added effect of cleaning up corpses for characters
          that people no longer intend to play. <BR>
          - Crippling Blows will now display the correct damage in the

          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Recently,
          an exploit was discovered that allowed certain unsavory individuals
          to loot the corpses of other players without their consent. The
          precise symptom of this is that the owner would find their corpse
          stripped of everything except for no-drop items, and items in
          a bag with no-drop items. This exploit was fixed in this patch.

          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Rogues
          received several enhancements as part of this patch: </FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">- The
          chance to score a critical hit with a throwing weapon has been
          increased significantly. <BR>
          - When throwing a weapon from behind the NPC in question, a rogue
          now has a chance to score a &quot;Deadly Strike&quot;, for enhanced
          damage above and beyond that of a critical hit. <BR>
          - A new rogue-specific ability has been added to the &quot;Hide&quot;
          skill. It is called &quot;Evade&quot;. This skill has the effect
          of lowering the amount that the targeted NPC hates the rogue,
          and has the potential of making the engaged NPC switch to another
          target (preferably a tank) within the rogue's group. It is essentially
          a &quot;reverse taunt&quot;. This ability helps mitigate the
          negative effects of the rogue's exceedingly high damage-output
          potential. It also will in-turn help the rogue do even more damage
          as the NPC is much more likely to expose its back. It is engaged
          by targeting the NPC you wish to &quot;Evade&quot; and pressing
          the &quot;Hide&quot; button. As a note, you must not be in combat
          mode in order to use this ability. </FONT></P>

          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The Mistwalker
          will once again cast its spell as often as it used to prior to
          the last patch. However, the resulting pet will now automatically
          &quot;dissipate&quot; after one combat round. The change that
          reduced the &quot;proc&quot; percentage on the weapon was made
          due to an unintended interaction between the pet and the target
          when several users of this weapon were attacking the same target.
          Since the new pet now automatically<BR>
          dissipates after one round, the reduced &quot;proc&quot; percentage
          was no longer necessary. </FONT></P>

          armor quests, especially those belonging to Clerics, Paladins,
          and Shadowknights, have been reduced in terms of how long it

          and others that found particular pieces of their armor exceedingly

          been changed from &quot;Coin + 1 item&quot; to &quot;Coin Only&quot;.
          This change was made to study the impact of loot-rules upon server
          population in reference to the loot/efficiency disparity between
          caster and melee characters. This change is a test, and may or
          may not be retained or rolled out across the other PvP servers,
