<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">first off, i only left your side once for a short time. I never speak for or condone the actions of my brothers, they are who THEY are. I control them not.  The time you helped the necro you asked for my forgiveness, and i gave it, when i strayed formt he light and returned, i asked for your forgiveness,and you gave it.  As for the instances, neither of us have proof of what went down. In Infestus's defense, i had several people tell me he never cussed at you or any member at that time, despite what you say I do look into every aspect.  In your message you make me sound like i was thrown from this guild like an outcast, and returning to get revenge because I am bitter. No, i left this guild, and quietly because of my beliefs.  I would have stayed quiet for all time, but to see someone say how foolish we are to doubt you and that we should praise you, that sickened me. Im not gaining anything from speaking out against you. In fact, i lost all the people i once called friends. No material wealth is worth more than that.  I now travel alone, and you are right, this one man cant bring down the kingdom you've created in the last four years. You'll no longer hear from Ronfar Mauri, i just wanted to present to the public my views and let them take it how they want it. I am no a saint, and i am not a devil, i just see what is right and what is wrong.</FONT>
