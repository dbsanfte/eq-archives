            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Last
            night, as I finished the installation of the client, I began
            to wonder if I would feel the same way.. as I had with EverQuest.
            I entered the<BR>
            character creation screen knowing nothing of the strengths or
            weaknesses of the 3 races available.. ( a European based race,
            an Asian based race and an Arab based race ). After looking at
            the various modifications that you can make per face, per race,
            I chose Aluvian ( the European based race ). I then was able
            to chose the starting clothing. I chose no headgear, a puffy
            shirt and a puffy pair of pants and leather boots.. ( NOTE: STARTING
            EQUIPMENT DOES NOTHING AS ARMOR ).. This means that I was able
            to really choose the look I wanted.. I tried on differing colors
            and settled for an all black ensamble. Then, I chose a name.
            I chose.. Kirel the Redhand (<BR>
            grins ).</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The next
            thing to do was to chose my skill set. They have various skill
            sets from your basic warrior.. a blademaster.. a healer.. an
            enchanter..wizard/mage.. rogue and some others. Also, if you
            are so inclined, you can create a totally custom skill set. Anyway..
            I chose blademaster. I then modified the best stats ( Quickness,
            Coordination and Strength ) as much as I was able to.).. The
            system is set so that you can modify them in any way, but for
            every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.. ( hehe
            )..<BR>
            For instance, To raise Coordination and Quickness, I had to sacrifice
            my sence of self and my focus ( the two things needed for good
            magic skills ).</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Once
            done there, you have your actual skills. I chose 4 skills to
            be my &quot;special&quot; skills and left the others alone (
            later I learned that you can really do whatever you want here..
            but there is a caviat. Let us say that you chose as I did.. a
            blademaster.. and sacrificed your focus and sense of self : In
            your skills, you can choose to have healing or magic as a training
            skill.. but because you have such low focus and self ( no mana
            ), being able to train in magic does you no good. You can't use
            it....</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Anyway..
            from there I entered the world into a pre-defined town/area.
            I went to the newbie trainer.. learned how to fight, how do pick
            stuff up.. how to use the camera... ( very well thought out and
            the interface seems very intuitive.. you can use standard quake
            keys for movement... as well as the arrows. I played for about
            1 hour .. just learning how do do stuff.. emotes... running around..
            got into a battle .. ( attacked a cow.. Hahahahaha )... found
            an experianced player who wanted me to assess his weapon ( one
            of my primary skills )... I did so, it was a basic sword, nothing
            special.. He was disappointed and just gave it to me.. ( YAY!..
            a real weapon )..</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Over
            all.. I enjoyed my time there.. but I was disappointed in a few

            3rd person view. The camera angles are great, but I really do
            not like the semi - Tomb Raider view Graphics.... While the spell
            effects.. the fire.. stuff like that are undoubtably Awesome,
            I was not to impressed with the over-all graphics... The houses
            were good, the tree's looked.. like background paper .. the falling
            leaves confused me at first ( thought they were flying monsters
            that I could not hit ).. but they were a nice touch.. The monsters...
            looked good enough ( I saw 3 types.. one was a greyish.. almost
            classic alien<BR>
            looking thing.. another.. a cross between a wolf and an ape..
            ( mind you, I was running for my life and the camera angles only
            let me see just a bit of this one ).. and the cow.. *giggles*..
            If any of you have played Microsofts Monster Truck racing game...

<BR>
<BR>
          Hi..<BR>
<BR>
          I am an avid player of Everquest. I have been part of the EQ
          community for well over a year now and participated in phases
          3 and 4 of the<BR>
          beta. While I am very happy ( aside from a few small things )
          about EverQuest, I am constantly on the prowl for a new game.
          Yesterday I ran across an article in PCGamer about the new game
          that you are creating. Sovereign. Wow.. from what I read.. it
          looks very impressive. But, I ( and the guild I am involved with
          ) would like even more information. BTW.. I am a part of &quot;the
          Crimson Rose&quot;... ( one of the first guilds to test guild
          function in eq during phase 3 ). So.. I ask.. Is there a web
          address where I can send my guildmates to .. to find out about
          Sovereign.. ( ooohhh.. this game excites me to no end... having
          a guild.. command a nation of city states.... Hehe.. a very powerful
          force )<BR>
          Thank you in advance for answering any and all questions that
          you are able to.<BR>
          Ps.. I am not the guild master, I am the Vice-Chancellor... I
          advise the king/leader on all moves ( or potential moves ) that
          the guild makes.<BR>
