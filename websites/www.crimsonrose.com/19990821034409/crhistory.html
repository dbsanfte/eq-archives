            of metal clashing and fires burning could be heard echoing throughout
            the defeated castle's chambers. The Throne Room was the only
            safe haven left inside the castle now. And it was there that
            the surviving members of the Council of Lords had gathered for
            their last stand.</FONT></B></P>

            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mandrake,
            a young King of only 19 winters, inherited the throne from his
            father's early death. Untested even on the battlefields the members
            trusted him none the less. All except one.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Believe
            it you fool!&quot; Mayhem shouted, &quot;Your delusions of taming

            CHILD.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mayhem then
            threw his mysterious black cloak over his shoulders and disappeared
            into the darkness of the castle's chambers. A sense of uneasiness
            settled in the room as the angry assassin left.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;He is

            listen to that amateur&quot; Overkill spoke out, &quot;he'll

            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Overkill,
            a warrior with a life darker then that of even Mayhem's. Overkill
            knew the ways even of Diablo's most elite toops better then any
            in the land. He took pride in protecting the guild from any threat
            that dared attack them. A powerful asset to the guild he was,
            but this time even his great skill could not stop Diablo's horde.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Draw

            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A hint of
            a smile came across Overkill's face as he drew his weapon. The
            pounding sound on the large oak doors had become deafening.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;For
            the Glory of the Kingdom!&quot; Dantrag shouted over the noise.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The remaining

            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The once mighty
            doors splintered into hundred of fragments from the huge Mud
            Runner that now howled with joy. At that moment the forces of
            evil gathered at the beast feet began to pour in the room. The
            final stand had begun.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">~</FONT></B></CENTER></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Die
            you beast of Hell!&quot; Dantrag shouted as he buried his battle-axe
            into the final deamon.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Throne
            Room was now a shattered into fragment of the glorious room it
            once was. Banners laid on the floor in tatters, statues knocked
            down and the foundation had been torn from the very ground of
            the room. Heaps of rubble lay across the floor and coughing and
            moaning could be heard through the gray cloud of dust.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Dantrag
            where is Mandrake?&quot; Overkill asked worriedly.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;I do
            not know&quot; Dantrag said slowly scanning the debris for any

            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Over
            there!&quot; Goldmoon pointed.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the distance
            a large boulder sat in the middle of the room, atop it a large
            mangled banner of the Council of Lords. Beneath it, the opened
            bloody hand of their former leader.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;NO!&quot;
            Dantrag said running to his fallen Lords side.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Quickly the
            members began assembling around the site of their fallen king.
            Bloody and wounded the members ignored their pains and watched
            with sunken hearts as death began to take Mandrake.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Stand
            back Dantrag&quot; Alaster said &quot;Let me help&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Alaster the
            guild's arch-wizard began and incantation and with a powerful
            force of energy the boulder faded out of existence. Slowly the
            banner of the Guild drifted onto the shattered body of Lord Mandrake.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Avenge
            me&#133;&quot; Mandrake spoke out with his dying breath, slowly
            his grip let go of Dantrag's hand.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Who?
            Who did this to you?&quot; Dantrag pled.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At that moment
            Mandrake slipped away, and almost in unison the surrounding members
            closed their eyes and paid their respects for their fallen leader.
            After a short while a nervous voice spoke out,</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;What
            do we do now?&quot; One of the castle guards asked.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Yes
            what now?&quot; Another could be heard.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;We will
            bury our fallen and leave this place&quot; Dantrag quickly stated
            &quot;Then we will find safety in other lands to rebuild our
            forces, who is with me?&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;I will&quot;
            The members all spoke at once, surprising Dantrag with their
            confidence.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dantrag then
            hoisted up the body of Mandrake into his arms and moved towards
            the door.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;We have
            a lot of work to do and little time in which to do it in.&quot;
            He stated &quot;Let us get to work&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">And with that
            the members began gathering their fallen and slowly moved out
            from the ruined castle. They headed towards a small village near
            Tristam, where the Council of Lords owned a large tavern. There,
            friends and allies would be to help them. From this tavern the
            former member of the Council of Lords began to heal and regroup.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">~</FONT></B></CENTER></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dantrag slowly
            walked away from the tavern late one night. The sounds of laughter
            and singing could be heard behind him inside the drinking hall.
            But tonight was a mournful night for the newfound leader of the
            former Council, the month anniversary of the fall of his Lord.
            Dantrag made his way to Mandrake's Tomb to pay his respects,
            when an old acquaintance showed.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;You're
            out late tonight&quot; A voice came from the darkness up ahead
            near the tomb.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Who's
            there?&quot; Dantrag questioned.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;An old
            friend&quot; Mayhem then stepped out of the seemingly shadows
            themselves within an arms length of new leader.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Mayhem!
            You are alive?&quot; Dantrag took a step back amazed &quot;How
            did you find your way out of the castle that night?&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Tis
            a trade secret&quot; he stated &quot;But no talk of that, I have
            come to rejoin my comrades and to serve under your new command.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;More
            members are always needed and your skills would be most helpful
            to us, but your loyalty to our cause has been questioned&quot;
            Dantrag stated &quot;what do you have to say to defend thyself?&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Mayhem looked
            around uneasily, &quot;I am ashamed of my actions that night
            and wish to earn back everyone's trust.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Very
            well, go to them. They are in the tavern sharing both spirits
            and stories, tell them I have sent you.&quot; Dantrag said, &quot;But
            I would like to be left alone tonight&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Thank
            you my liege you shall not regret this decision&quot; and with
            that Mayhem quickly headed towards the tavern.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The tomb was
            beautiful, carved by both the finest Dwarven and Elven craftsmen
            in the area. Upon entering the tomb, Dantrag saw the sarcophagus
            of Mandrake carved from marble into the leader's likeness. Red
            roses had been placed atop the sarcophagus by other members,
            bringing color to the pale white tomb. Dantrag slowly picked
            up one of the roses and thought of how bravely they had fought
            night and how much they all missed Mandrake.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Suddenly the
            tomb darkened and an apparition appeared above the sarcophagus.
            It took the form of a giant hissing snake with red eye slithering
            down an assassin's blade.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;BY THE
            GODS!&quot; Dantrag shouted stepping back.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The apparition
            then disappeared as quickly as it had formed.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Avenge
            me Dantrag&quot; came a voice from the sarcophagus &quot;Take
            thy friends and bring glory to this realm once again.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Dantrag looked
            down and saw that his hand began to bleed from the rose he held
            so tightly. The crimson colored rose awed him, a flower of such
            beauty and the ability to protect itself from being harmed.</FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT COLOR="#a80000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Yes
