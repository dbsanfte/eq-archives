<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">: Greetings brothers and sisters, <p>: I would like to get a tally of those of you whom would benefit from my Fletching Skills... I'm currently a Master Fletcher, trying to better my skills. However, the problem lies in the cost of such tutelage. I've been offered a sponsorship by our humble King if enough of you would benefit from the use of a good bow and/or arrows. It is costing me several gold pieces to make a single arrow to further my skill, and my coin purse is getting lighter by the day. If I have enough archers in need of a better bow, at no more than wholesale cost, I will be granted this loan. Please let me know on this board if you are willing to be a recipient of this craft. Otherwise, I shall leave my tutor, and be happy with the skills I have aquired.<p>: Thank you,<p>: Mandon Ashenwood<br>: Ranger of Tunare<p></FONT>
