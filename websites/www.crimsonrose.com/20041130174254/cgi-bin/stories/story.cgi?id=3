    <td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">May 11th, 2003, 1104 hrs --->   Tis true, I suppose. That I am not evil by nature, but at times I wish to go out and start a good bar-brawl! It wasn't two days past that I said to myself..."Self, you gotta get offa Talus!"...and do you know what 'self' said back? He said, "Dantrag, get yer ass offa Talus!" And so my journey begins...On Naboo.<p><p>Attacking Nightspiders and Flesh Eating Chuba's are really NOT my thing, but they do give some experiance and so must die. And thus, the circle of life, continues.<p><p>*LOL* Some guy is outside the city limits of Kaadraa making furniture and leaving it in the open grass by a rebel base - heh<p><p>Heading back to the city to get another mission to make some money. SO far it seems that missions give a good amount of credits (money), and seem to be pretty easy to do.<p><p>I got a screen of a Wookiee just inside the gates playing an instrument, kinda like a "Sax". He is all white and dancing like a fairie now! OMG! Get me outta here!<p><p>Oh Great! Another..."Connection To SWG Lost"...message. Story continues later I guess.May 18th, 2003 - 0912 hrs --->  Logged in and tried running to town after clearing my "DataPad". Got jumped by a herd of Chuba's. Didn't stand a chance. When I recover, gunna try my run again.<p><p>0915 hrs ---> I am "on the road again", actually on the field again, but who's counting right? Off I go back to Naboo to get some more missions. Hopefully it will turn out better for me this time. Maybe get some xps along the way.<p><p>0916 hrs ---> Rebel Troops ahead! Gunna check them out. A HUGE Rebel Base is here! Gunna try for a mission here instead! <p><p>I can't believe my eyes! Rebel and Imperial troops in VERY close proximity to each other here!<p><p>0921 hrs ---> After chatting with a Rebel Trooper named Ecikoin, I got an assignment. Although it is in "code", I will try it anyways, I am heading to my "Light-marker" to see what can be done about this.<p><p>I see a power transformer up ahead. I am attacking it and have destroyed it. I get 18 points of Rebel faction and a reward is placed in the bank for me in the amount of, 1,810 credits! Not too shabby for a less then 5 minute mission! I have enough to at least train my first skill which will cost me 1,000 credits. Off to my next mission hunt...<p><p>0926 hrs ---> I see Kaadu Females ahead...gunna try to get me "some".<p><p>They keep running away from me! Oh well! Off to find more targets to bash!<p><p>0931 hrs ---> I just got gang-banged by a Fanned Rawl and it's significant other. Didn't feel good....so I am outta here!<p><p>0934hrs ---> I am inside city gates now, THANKFULLY! I am sitting to gain back my red,green and blue bars to I can go out and kick off on that ass of a Rawl and screw it's mate at the same time! Rawls look like giant snakes and the female looks like a King Cobra, while a Chuba looks like a HUGE frog with legs like a cat and very sharp teeth!<p><p>(note to self: self, when you decide to fight more then one critter, make sure you are at full health!)<p><p>0937 hrs ---> off I go again for another try at the Rawls! Wish me luck!<p><p>0940 hrs ---> *limps back to the city gates missing several limbs* It did not work out as I had planned for some reason. I think these Rawls have a bonus against Zabraks! I am sure of it! I MUST investigate this further! Sitting to rest and heal while going to get some more milk and use the restroom!<p><p>0952 hrs ---> Just ran out and fought a Nuna - looks like a tadpole with a short tail on 2 legs - I killed it, but not after it gave me a good kick in the "jimmy"! A few more of these and I will be able to go to the bank, get my money, then go get "skilled up"! WOOT WOOT! See ya in a short bit, gunna go get the last of my points to get "skilled up", be back when I am no longer a Novice!<p><p>1002 hrs - Just got my "Intermediate Unarmed Specialization"! Still have about 1,000 credits in the bank, so gunna go get some xps to get my "one-hand sword specialization". Just accepted a mission from the mission terminal, to kill something...heh...again, just gunna follow the "light-pole" to my mission. Easy stuff actually - heh - Will give a "sit-rep" once I am there.<p><p>1007 hrs ---> Just left Keren city limits - This is going to be a LOOOONG run! Had to run around a herd of Nuna. Just found a Storm-Trooper camp - there appears to be a player killing them - heh<p><p>1011 hrs ---> Just found a den of Hermit Spiders. Gunna try my luck with them. Wish me luck!<p><p>1012 hrs ---> Not good when a herd of Kaadu males come and help. I think this is a conspiracy against Zabraks. I MAY have to call Johnny Cockran!<p><p>1015 hrs ---> I am back on my feet but ran a ways away so I can rest to max before trying my mission, which is not far away now. Next contact when I am just about to start my mission.<p><p>1024 hrs ---> I am about to start my mission - wish me luck!<p><p>Welp, the mission I think calls for me to kill some Ikpoi, which look like water buffulo. I killed one, but the others raped me. My ass is pretty big about now!<p><p>1028 hrs ---> Gotta rest up now that I am back on my feet. I think I will use my blaster next time to "pull" one at a time, or last least try to. heh - be back in a bit, gunna head out for a short bit to be with Pammy before she heads out to do some errands.<p>0817 hrs ---> Still trying to complete the mission...and it's changed to killing "Nightspiders", which are just HUGE dark spiders!<p><p>0830 hrs ---> Killed the spiders, then a "Peko Peko" decided to "con" me and attack. Wasn't a pretty sight...for me.<p><p>Waiting to re-spawn...<p><p>0835 hrs ---> Heading back to Keren (Naboo) to take on another mission.<p><p>0855 hrs ---> Joined a group of 2 (3 total in group). Amara Lakta-On`xo, Nana Neste and myself. I am the Brawler and they both are Marksmen/Scout. And might I say, they kill the big stuff really fast from a distance. I don;t know the weapons they are using...but WoW!<p><p>0911 hrs ---> We are in camp now...apparently Amara is a dancer as well...and dancing at the moment. The moves she is doing is funny as hell...but kinda cool at the same time. LOTS of animation!<p><p>0915 hrs ---> Still in camp...listening to the cackle of the fire, the smell of the smoke and camp side chatter - Off we go to kill some more...<p><p>0923 hrs ---> Should have stayed in camp. For some reason, female kaadu are on the rag and when they "con" me, they say, "OH HAPPY DAY THIS IS! LUCKY US!" - I hate Kaadu!<p><p>0925 hrs ---> Camp site finally puttered out! *sigh* Off we go again.<p><p>0932 hrs ---> Maverick Gualama's are REALLY tough creatures! Advice: Run!<p><p><p></font></td>
