This page is made so you can read the dev team reports, from the SWG threads, without having to load all the other threads from dorks who just clutter up message boards with nothing but non-sense. Only a few (roughly two or three) threads will be posted here at any one time as to keep down on the load time for you. If you want to go to their boards anyways, the link below will take you to the dev team's board. Everything posted here is directly from SWG's Dev Team Board.

Our plan right now is to have Beta 3 start sometime in the second half of February or in the beginning of March. I’m hoping to have a more specific date available at the Developer’s Chat next week.<p>
Beta 2 is coming along fine for us. The testers are shaking down the advancement and balance for several professions and are trying out some new POIs (Points of Interest like the one mentioned in Shug’s recent post). Although we haven’t done official beta focus testing for certain things like crafting, those systems have been turned on and players have started trying their hand at them. (Internally systems like crafting have been getting a lot of testing by the way). We’re getting tons of good feedback on what systems need more attention, what ones are feeling good, and of course lots of bug reports.<p>

The team is ramping up for our two final milestones. The first being getting all of the beta 3 required art assets ready for the Beta 3 CDs (looks like there will be three of them). We also have a large laundry list of things that need to be working well in the game before we open the gates. These include greater server stability, a tutorial, all systems working, and enough balance so we don’t have to do many (if any) character wipes during beta 3.<p>

After that milestone, the next one is “Gold Master”. This refers to the final CDs you make internally that get tested and then sent to the duplication house to make lots of pretty packages for the stores. The team is already working tons of overtime with their eyes on this date (In fact we have signs with ominous numbers like “8 weeks until GM” around the office). I have to say it is a daunting task but so far it looks like the team is in relatively good shape to deliver the required feature set for launch.<p>

Your question, of course, is “What is the feature set?” Next week before the Developer’s Chat we intend on listing our launch feature set and giving the FAQ an overhaul. As we’ve gotten into the implementation and beta testing phase, we’ve made some changes to our initial designs for the game. In some ways I think we’ve pulled off a bit more than we originally expected and in other ways we may not have all the things we wanted for initial launch. Often this happens because when you test you find out what people enjoy and decide to put more emphasis there. The FAQ and Dev posts have always represented what we are working towards, but not necessarily what would be in at launch. Rest assured that we will have an aggressive schedule for adding features and new content when we go live. Our goal now is to bring you a competitive, stable and fun Star Wars game. More on this next week.<p>

Now I don’t want to give even more attention to those who worship the floating shrub bug from a month or so ago, but the weirdest thing happened. We needed to make some changes to how our terrain worked in the last patch. When we did another bug sprung up where hundreds of pieces of flora was no longer attached to the ground. Perhaps there is something more to this shrub cult than meets the eye…<br>

Welcome to another round of Q’s Query, a thread where you get to play the part of a developer for an MMO. This week the topic will be on player advancement. Specifically, we’re talking about learning skills and gaining profession titles.<p>

To avoid the “level treadmill” we are putting less emphasis on “finishing” the game by maxing out a profession. We’re figuring that the average (and I use the word loosely) player could fill up his learn capacity in about 3 months of steady play. We hope that players will realize there is much more to do in the game than just “leveling up” (so to speak) and are giving many avenues for enjoying the game beyond watching your xp bars go up. In other words, you may have a couple professions mastered, but have you tried the other 20+ professions? Have you earned all the badges? Have you explored all the planets? Done all the theme parks? Took part in a P.A. war? Spent lots of Faction points? Seen all the POIs? Built a house? Took part in a player run event? Encountered every creature? Located the holy shrub? Etc.<p>
But this thread is about what you would do if you were making a MMO game and it specifically revolves around professions:<br><br>
 <b>1)</b> How long should it take to “max” out a character in terms of profession?<br>
 <b>2)</b> How would you cater to the “power gamer” who plays for more than 40 hours a week?<br>
 <b>3)</b> How would you cater to the “casual gamer” who plays for less than 15 hours a week?<br>
 <b>4)</b> How do you deal with the inherited perception that “Level 50” (or whatever) is the “point” of the game?<p>

I realize this Query is similar to my one on Professions, but that one dealt more with what you wanted as a player. This one should focus more on what you would do as a developer who doesn’t want people to leave the game because they felt they “finished it too quickly” and also don’t want people to get frustrated by the game because “it takes forever to get anywhere.” Plus it is relevant to where we are in Beta right now.<p>
