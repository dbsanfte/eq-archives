<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Took a turn for the worse today...and with infection running rampant from punctures in her lung and intestine, we can hardly be with her.  When I have been able to, I have mentioned you all...and it is the rare times that she smiles!  (Except for when I tell her I am cooking for us!  Then she actually tries to laugh!)<br>But she knows of all of your prayers, well wishes, and kind thoughts.  I copy them and read them to her!  I am scared and I am worried, but spending time with you all is helping tremendously!  I am eterally grateful for all you say and do,...and for who you are!  She absolutely lives each day to the fullest, and has taught us the same.  You see there are quite a few of us...she has taken off the street when we were very young...got us away from drugs, prostitution, or worse and raised us as her own, for she never had any children.  And yet she nevers asks for more than that we give back by giving to others in any way we can!  Oddly enough, I feel that same grace in Crimson Rose guild family members... many kindnessess and much love.  Aye...the Gods have blessed us with her, and me with you!  Of that I have no doubt!  Thank ye!</FONT>
