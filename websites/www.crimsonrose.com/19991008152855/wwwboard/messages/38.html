<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">I've heard of yee Aventra. Me brother use to talk highly of yee. You were right about one thing, but it is already happening. Can you not tell me brother is already cold of heart. Does he no seem distant to yee? He does not help those like he use to. i feel his lifeforce fading. This is why I must find him. To take him back to SilentFist Clan. Only our disiplen's can save his soul before it falls deeper. I have reached ButcherBlock and can feel him slipping away, I must hurry to find him.</FONT>
