Welcome to the Crimson Rose Gaming Hub. As you might know, we were once a online gaming guild that spanned a course of over 5 years. Since the arrival of more online games, we decided to move into them all. After several attempts at this, we decided to move to something a bit differant. As of now, The Crimson Rose is no longer a guild in the sense that you know of. We are now just a hub where anyone can come and connect up with other online gamers to set up games of various makes by the use of the extensive message board we have. If there is a game that you wouldlike to see on the message board, contact Scribe or Ares and give 48 hours for it to be posted for you.<br><br> This site will no longer worry about offending those that have weak hearts in the aspect of language, jokes, or anything that may be offensive. If you are easily offended or have a weak heart, we encourage you to not bookmark this site or frequent it in anyway. This site will not endorse pornography of any sort.<br><br>If you have something that you would like to see posted for others to see on the main page here, email Scribe and he will see that it is posted for you. Over the next few days, links to the left will be changing to reflect the change we are going through, so mind your step for a little while.<hr>
<B><A NAME="983903334"><FONT COLOR="#6699CC" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">Patch Day!</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#6699CC" SIZE="2" FACE="arial"> - <A HREF="mailto:dantrag@crimsonrose.com">Dantrag</A> @ 10:28 am PST on 3/06/01</FONT><br><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">Transfer complete.<br>Patch process complete.<br>*******************************************************<br>March 6th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br>*The Fan Faire comes home!*<p>The next EverQuest Fan Faire will be held April 6 - April 7, 2001 at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We expect this one to sell out quicker than Baltimore not only because the weather will be warmer, but also because it's a safe bet to say you'll get to meet even more Verant personalities since our offices are local. Don't delay with registration because you may get left out! <p>The registration deadline is March 28th.  Go to http://www.station.sony.com/fanfaire for details.<p>***Patch Day***<p>*General Changes*<p>-- Doubled the chance gain skill points in skills that are above 200. <br>-- Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal's Breatplate on others once casted upon yourself.<br>-- The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by SKs<br>-- Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via /book or alt+b.<br>-- Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.<br>-- New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One on Antonica and two others on Kunark.  NPCs at these locations can fill you in on the details.  Good hunting.<br>-- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the "Celestial Healing" effect has been increased to one minute.  We understand that this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch.  We did, however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and kept on the group tank.  When we've decided on the new affect, it will be applied to those items retroactively.  <br>-- Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for skill values over 100.  Values under 100 still show the qualitative identifiers.<br>-- Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other players.  You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other players by typing /inspect. <br>-- Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over the chat window.<br>-- Fixed "Breath of the Sea". It was mistakenly set to be unresistable.<br>-- Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone.  This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all hatelists and clean up your pet.<br>-- "Voice Graft" will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) of your pet.<br>-- You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged.<br>-- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125.  It was the intent for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however before the scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better.  With the tracking improvements from the last patch, this increase was appropriate.<br>-- Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing.<p>*NPC AI Adjustments*<p>-- Level 60 players with the taunt skill will now have a chance to taunt creatures that are level 60 to 65.  Previously, players could only taunt creatures below their level.<br>-- NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount of hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their enemies.  Prior to this, they would add full hate when they saw you do this.  This is why NPCs would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez.<br>-- Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much "temporary hate" when a player would sit down in front of them.<br>-- The maximum amount of "hate" that an NPC can add when witnessing a heal to targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.<br>-- Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the number of hitpoints healed.  Previously, healing one hitpoint would cause one point of hate.  Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points of hate.<p>*Velious Music*<p>Velious subscribers should run the Velious Patch to pick up new mood music for some Velious Zones.  Let us know what you think of the new compositions. <p>*EQGems*<p>A new "mini-game" has been added to the EverQuest client.  EQGems is our first effort aimed towards allowing people to engage in different activities while playing EverQuest.  Based upon the success of EQGems, we may explore opportunities for other mini-games in the future, even some that are multiplayer in and of themselves.  Type /gems to play.<p>- The EverQuest Team

<B><A NAME="983768646"><FONT COLOR="#6699CC" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">Greetings... mortals</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#6699CC" SIZE="2" FACE="arial"> - <A HREF="mailto:Pharos@brokentower.com">Pharos</A> @ 9:04 pm PST on 3/04/01</FONT><br><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">As you stagger away from your friends and towards your chambers you catch a flicker of movement in the far shadows of the hall.  Before you can focus your bleary eyes a soft voice speaks.<p>"Greetings..." The voice is slow and drawn out, but clear and, oddly, pleasant sounding.  "I wish to introduce myself to you.  I am Pharos."<p>There is a dramatic pause after the announcement.  Seeing that you are unimpressed by the mere mention of his name, he mutters softly to himself for a minute before continuing.<p>"I am here, mortal, to present to you two things which you seek.  Knowledge and challenge.  Both can be valuable if used properly..."<p>Again, another dramatic pause.  This time the shadows seems to change and when he speaks again, the voice is coming from behind you.  You whirl around to try to find the source.<p>"Do not try to seek me out, mortal, for I shall find you when the time is right.  You will always have the option to accept or decline a challenge, as you will, but remember that only through hardship can you become strong."<p>The voice now seems to begin to fade away as it speaks, becoming softer and softer...<p>"For now, spread the word that a challenge has been issued to your Order.  The first challenge will be for you to seek out the Temple of Cazic Thule on this plane and return to me items made from the skin of his followers.  Do this, and you shall be rewarded well..."<p>Soft, almost insane sounding laughter follows the last and fades into the night.  You know that you are now alone with naught but the shadows for comfort.  Stone sober now, you go to wake the others with news of the strange challenge.  As you quicken your pace, the light of new adventure shines in your eyes and the promise of riches fill your head...<p><center><hr width=50%></center><p>[OOC] - Heyas.  As some of you know already, I am Pharos.  I would like to, once again, take a moment and welcome all of you to the CR/OOR guild!  This guild has been around for a long time, despite its young age on the AR server.<p>Adrikan is, I think, doing a great job taking care of posting news and what not.  As such, I would think it would be a shame for me to even try to step in on his role.  <p>Instead, I would like to use this forum as a way to promote some IC action and quests for the guild.  Those of us who do not wish to participate in an IC quest, please do not feel that you have to.  However, in order to collect the reward for any of Pharos's challenges, one must begin and end the quest IC.  The reward will be granted in game by Pharos or Dantrag if I cannot (as now =(  ) get into the game.  The rewards will <b>not</b> be posted here, nor will the actual quest item(s) <b>but</b> know that if you do complete a challenge the reward will be <b>well</b> worth the effort.<p>Since this is the first challenge, I'll take a quick moment to explain it a bit.  Pharos has made himself known - as an ally or enemy it is still uncertain...  His challenge is to go to Cazic-Thule and bring back Lizardscale items (esp cloaks and mantles of course).  The reward?  Who knows? =)  <p>The challenges are <u>not</u> meant to be done solo.  High levels and low levels will have challenges presented.  If a challenge seems something you can do alone, don't bother trying to collect the reward - I won't give it.  On the same token, if a challenge seems too difficult then perhaps another should undertake it.  Challenges are meant for full groups.  In this case, a full group between 25 and 35 is recommended.<p>If there is any specific zone or item you would like a challenge issued for, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:Pharos@brokentower.com">Pharos@brokentower.com</a>.  I will consider <b><i>all</i></b> suggestions equally and decide based on the current strength and needs of the guild.  <p>One last note - challenges are meant to be <b><u>fun</u></b>.  They are in no way manditory except that they must be carried out IC.<p>Good luck and above all - have fun =)
