<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ok. This is Ronfar - The same person, along with Rendarian, who left CR several times only to come back (how many times) saying that they were sorry and they did not mean to leave and that htey have found the error of thier ways and will not return to evil. How many times did you both leave? Three? Four?<br>How many times did I let you both back in? hmm? No. I dont post too often here as I donot feel the need. But when one does not have all the information, and they cling to something they know very little about, it makes me a bit disgruntled. So here is my answer to each and everyone of your remarks you made below.<p>1) I never reaclled this occasion. Although I would like to, this is not me in the slightest and for those that have known me for the 4 years or more, know that I am not that way. So Believe what you wish.<p>2) Daneth is this person name that I tried to help. What had happened was he was transferring his armor to me so I could give it to his other character at the XRoads. I di not have enough room in my inventory for all his items and some feel to the ground. As we all know, several people hang around there for resting and healing and the like.<br>How is it possible for me to have his things if I could not even hold it all in my inventory? I think the ONLY thing he was missinb were Black boots. And when I begged his for his apology and told him I would go get him more, his reply to me was something along the lines of, "No my King, No worries, I can get more." I tried for several minutes to tell him I would get him more, and he adamently refused my help. Ask Daneth this and he will tell you the same.<br>Again, you go on hear say. Tsk-Tsk.<p>3) Ah, Ol' Festy. Yes, I remember this as well. The reason he wanted to leave was becuase he died several times in a row and was very disgruntled at that. After several members, and a Baroness included, tried for well over an hour to keep him in the guild, with him the whole time sitting there and refusing the help or change his mind in staying with us, decided to give his things to Jinni and leave CR and EQ for good. Jinni did give me his things per my request. Yes. I asked for his things.<br>And Yes. I sold his items off. Ronfar, you came to me and pleaded wiht me to give his things back. However, yet again, what you fail to realize, or even comprehend, is the remarks made prior to you getting involved. Infestus cussing at me. Putting me down. Putting CR down. etc etc. Now, Manyof you know and have seen that I have forgiven many things and many people and allowed them to come back to CR, like you Ronfar. But I can not forgive someone who attacks me or my family in real life. <br>I do not put up with it NOR will I condone it. And yes. I gave him half his things back. I hold nothing but contempt for Infestus and would as soon help a worm then the likes of him again. Yet again, I say, Believe what you wish.<p>4) As for how I do my deals in game, that is my business alone and no one elses. I would suggest for you Ronfar to learn how to buy/trade low, and then sell/trade high. Then you may have the good things as well. And I say it again, Believe what you wish.<p>5) It is always refreshing to see disgruntled ex-members coming here to spread discention among us. I enjoy to hear the rmablings of others on how everything they say is fact and that only thier words are thr truth. To this, I say "BAH". Here is an ol' Jewish Proverb: "What you don't see with your eyes, DON'T invent with your tongue."<br>There is some truth in that if you look hard enough. I hold no one here. I dont make anyone stay. I dont make anyone do anything that I am not prepared to do myself. I am a FIRM believer of lead by example. All I ask is honesty, loyalty and dedication to CR. If you cant do that, then I ask you to leave.<p>If there are any of you that feel the same way as Ronfar that are still in CR, I ask you as well to leave. I don't want anyone here with me that does not believe what or how or even where I lead the guild. I have flourished with CR for over 4 years now. It will continue to flourish long after Ronfar, Rendarrian and Daneth are forgotten. I hold NO regrets to anything I have done this far or for the plans I have set forth ahead of us.<p>As you all know, I don't respond here hardly ever. This though deserved a response. And it ALWAYS seems to be from ex-members. I say this to current members. Do not feel that you can not speak your mind. In fact, I encourage it. However, know your place when speaking it and do it with tact and you will be heard with no reprocussions of any kind. <p>That is all from me. Fare well all and travel safely.<p><br>: Im keeping my name hidden because it is not the important issue here. A few of you will probably figure out who I am, so be it. I will also try not to name many people involved in the cases out of respect, they can come forth if they want. Cases?? yes,i have several incidents where the king seems to be corrupt.  Many of you wont even bother to read them, infact, this post might be deleted.  For those who read it, will it change your mind about Dantrag? My guess is no. You have made up your mind about the king before you even began to read this message.  You all are so eager to follow him blindly,like puppies, that you wont step back and look at it all. So why do i speak if my words land on deaf ears? I wanted the truth to be out there, to be presented. Ive tried to approach people in the past to help me speak, all of them cowered and didnt  help me. There are those in the guild who believe the same as me,but they wont speak out, they are comfartable where they are, even if it means following someone they really dont trust. So,now i present to you the things ive seen.<br>: 1. A certain member of the rose had given the king a nice weapon ( at the time), a shiny brass hally, to us for QUEST purposes. he next day that member saw dantrag using the halberd for himself.....which is fine....but the halberd was never used in a quest. So,what did happen to the halberd? The original owner doesnt know.<br>: 2. Another member asked dantrag to hold some items for him,blackened chain armor.  This member thought he could trust the king. When he returned to get his items, Dantrag had "lost" many pieces of the armor. He offered to help this member get the armor back. A week passed, 2, 3 ...a month....dantrag never even spoke of it after that. The member who identity is remained hidden had to go forth and get his own items back. He asked dantrag several time why he didnt help him,only to be ignored. When the king finally answered he just blew him off and told the member he had not aquired ANY black chain since that time,yet,the very next day dantrag was seen wearing the exact pieces he had "lost" a month before.<br>: 3.  Many of you remember infestus correct? Remember how he decided to quit, even after many of you tried to convince him not to? He gave his items to jinni and said his farewells.  Jinni gave the items to dantrag who promptly sold them for cash.  He didnt give any thought to the idea of infestus return wen he had cooled off ( he had quit because he was angered,enraged, about something). two or three days later infestus did return. Now,i dont agree with what festy did, but i dont agree what the king did either.  I spoke to the king and infestus at the same time,trying to make peace.  (you know who i am now Dan?) Dantrag would not give the cash to infestus. Why? it was only 200 pp. Is our guild so in need of money that we will take all that a young dwarf has? I pleaded with the king for over 3 hours to gve infestus his things back.  I could only get him to give half back.  A king is someone who should be caring, forgiving, and kind. Dantrag was mean, vengeful, and full of hate that night, to a man who really did him nothing.  They both acted like children. A king that acts like a child, do you really want to follow someone like that?<br>: 4. This goes to who ever said "why dont we blame people like giacomo who started in full bronze?" well,first of all,they dont hold the guild treasures. Even so, Giacomo started out with alot of bronze, which is costly,but not impossible. Dantrag has had multiple characters start in gear so expensive its not funny. On was a bard in almost a full set of STEEL plate. He was better equiped than Cairbre, a paladin who was so much higher than him.<br>: 5. This doesnt have to deal with the king, but to sale who said we should talk to our family, CR. CR isnt the family it was once was ( or perhaps i was just to foolish to see it was never one). When Aventra and LLassie died, all of you made your posts,giving grief, but most of you forgot the event a day later. How about Soth who was married to Llassie? Did you talk to him? Express your sorrow to him? Only 3 people did. But i am getting off the topic now.<br>:         I am done now. Point and call me liar. Tell me these things arent important. Do what ever you must to keep faith in your king. But I ask..why? I've only come up with two reasons.  You either dont want to leave the guild because of friends in it...to this I say...You dont need a king. Disband and make your own group. Make a democracy. Dantrag did not invent the ideals of good, and he certainly doesnt follow them.  The other reason ive come up with. You are too attached to the king and dont want to leave him. To this i say, if you wish to follow a bad king, change your ways, You obviously dont care about upholding the virtue CR was s'pose to stand for. Dont claim to be good any longer. Ive kept quiet for so long, now i have spoken....the rest is up to you.<p>: ~the dark one<p></FONT>
