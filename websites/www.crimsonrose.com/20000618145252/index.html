The expansion set is entitled, The Conquerors.   Here are two snippets from the articles dealing with Huns and Mayans.<br><b><font color="#6699CC" size="3"> The Huns: </font></b><br>So what are the gameplay bonuses of this most famous of raider civilizations? Many of their bonuses and abilities are designed to promote raiding and quick strikes. In fact, the Huns have one enormous bonus that is a huge economic boon. The Huns do not need to build houses! Although they start with 100 less wood, they never have to worry about building houses to accommodate a larger population. Says Street, "Start a 150 pop cap game, and your indicator will say "4/150.'" The Huns can thus use the wood that others spend on houses for building barracks and farms and rushing to the next ages. A Hun player can race to the Castle Age fairly quickly thanks to this bonus.<br>This link will take you to the article on Huns.<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/previews/0,10869,2580020,00.html" target="_blank">  Age of Empires: The Conquerors, Hun review</a><br><b><font color="#6699CC" size="3"> The Mayans: </font></b><br>Although the Mayans weren't the most famous ancient civilization from Central America, they have a lasting legacy.  Indeed, as Street points out, the Mayans continue to exist even today: "The Mayans leave much more of a modern legacy than do the Huns or Goths. There are still some four million Mayans alive and well in Guatemala, Mexico, and Belize, and the remains of their cities have weathered the centuries as well as any German castle, despite being located inside tropical rain forests."<br>This will take you to the Mayan article. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/previews/0,10869,2588234,00.html" target="_blank">  Age of Empires: The Conquerors.
