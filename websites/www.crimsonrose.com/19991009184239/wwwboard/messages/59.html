<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">OOC - As a Law Enforcement Officer in Canada I can<br>say that I truly adore and admire folks such as your mom that have the courage and compassion to give of themselves to help youth that have strayed from the path. It is people like her that still care for these kids when society wants to banish or condemn them largely because they can not understand or empathize with them. I pray for your mom's speedy recovery and also for a calm to the boiling blood of her young attacker.<p>In the spirit of The Crimson Rose<br>Graewulf<p></FONT>
