          happened to Crossroads??? <BR>
          Sometime this morning (4/28/99) Nick Fisher &quot;Trixter&quot;,
          operator of WarZone<BR>
          Gaming Network, disabled all sites on the xrgn.com domain. Unfortunately,<BR>
          the domain was registered by him and so I have no way to turn
          it back on.<BR>
          Earlier attempts to purchase the domain fell on deaf ears, as
          he was (and<BR>
          still is) content to use it for his own needs (and likely just
          to spite me).</FONT></P>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Hello
          All,</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">I waited
          until it was 7:30pm pst tonight to write this update. I wanted
          to make sure things were stable before I wrote this. Lately every
          time I give an update something bad happened right after I sent
          it.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Here's
          a summary of what was done in the last 2 days</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">1) We
          did a major hardware upgrade to our primary router here in San
          Diego.<BR>
          2) We worked with CERFnet to do a router upgrade to their facility
          here in San Diego.<BR>
          3) We moved Karana over to CERFnet<BR>
          4) We brought up Rodcet Nife</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">I think
          you will find now that the packet loss should be basically gone...
          at least on our end. We were definetely causing some of the loss
          before (only when we hit major numbers) but now things are very,
          very clean running and that is with 23,582 people on just as
          I write this (a new record).</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Does
          this mean that EVERYONE'S Packet Loss is gone? Absolutely not.
          BUT, I did some surveys in most of the worlds and about 75% of
          the people told me their Packet Loss was great. If you are having
          problems now, do a traceroute to chat.everquest.com and send
          it to the email address traceroute@verant.com and we will take
          a look. We take our customers connections very seriously, and
          if a whole lot of people on one network are having a problem
          we will do our best to look into it. It doesn't mean we can always
          get the reaction we want (some networks are just plain bad) but
          many times we can help find a legitimate problem and help correct
          it.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Some
          of you may also not realize what the network statistics we have
          in game actually are for:</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The left
          hand number is your ping to the server in milliseconds.<BR>
          The left-middle number (percentage) is your packet loss to the
          server<BR>
          The right-middle number (percentage) is your packet loss from
          the server<BR>
          The right hand number is the data rate. THIS IS NOT THE PING.
          - I love hearing about the &quot;terrible&quot; pings in game
          of 3000.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">It is
          my strong belief (forgive me for this rant) that EVERY online
          game should have this type of meter so that you are getting real
          feedback about the network status.<BR>

          you've seen the advertisement for it on EQ Vault by now. I've
          been spending a good ammount of time on this blasted website
          as of late, and I have seen other members pass by me (Level-wise)
          at high speed while I devote time to the completion of this &quot;project&quot;
          of mine. As you can see on the website the original plan was
          to simply have a store which I can sell some of those hard-to-sell
          items I would aquire later on. When the thought hit me, &quot;what
          about those other poor souls who need somewhere to sell their
          items in-game?&quot; Theres a good chance I may scrap the General
          store all-together. Or possibly change its purpose. Thus far
          I have recieved but a single request to post an item, and according
          to what they have told me the Marketplace has some excellent
          potential. I would encourage all CR members to use the Marketplace
          to sell their items when they think NPCs just arent giving enough.
          Of course, its free to all CR members, and for non-members its
          only 5gp to post the add the first week, and 1gp a week therwafter
          to renew the add. Of course, as advertised, its free to everyone
          till April 30th. Please spread the word, the more people that
          use/view the site, the more usefull it becomes. Thank you, and
          enjoy.</FONT></P>

        has also lost his tag and now Jinni is the only member capable
        of giving out tags. We have spoken with GMs and they say they

          All,</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Well..
          thanks to all of your help we've been able to find a significant
          corpse dissapearence bug. We feel that this is a significant
          enough problem to warrant updating the servers during normal
          hours today, as we don't want anyone else's corpses to dissapear.
          We've also extended the amount of online time characters above
          5th level have to recover their bodies from 8 hours to 24 hours
          (online).</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">In a
          nutshell, the Corpse Recovery rules are as follows:</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Characters
          All Levels: If you have no items on your corpse, it will dissapear
          within 3 minutes.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Characters
          Level 1-5: Corpse will dissapear within 30 minutes (real time)
          whether you are online or offline. Those of you wondering why
          this rule is in place? - There would be WAY to many bodies ifwe
          didn't do it this way.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Characters
          Level 6 and above - Corpse will dissapear within 24 hours if
          the player is online (being at the character select screen STILL
          counts as online). Corpses will dissapear within 1 week if the
          player is offline.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">In addition,
          this server patch will include the following:</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">1) Warrior's
          now get a &quot;Bezerker Frenzy&quot; if they are down to under
          35% of their Hit Points.<BR>
          2) Several server side crash bugs have been fixed.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">I also
          wanted to mention that we have begun shipping units to Europe.
          Units should be in Electronics Boutique in the UK in a few days.
          Germany and other places in Europe will be hitting shortly...and
          Austrailia will be seeing units shortly as well.</FONT></P>

          of. We are challenging ourselves to do even more ambitious characters
          and backgrounds this time. There will be announcements soon about
          what to expect (well, more like teasers). I really do wish I
