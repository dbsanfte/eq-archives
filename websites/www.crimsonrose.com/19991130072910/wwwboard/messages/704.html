<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">I can't understand why one would take their own life but it happens far too often in this world.  I have lost friends that decided life was not meant for them and suffered from their loss.  To loose a friend was very emotional for me, to loose a family member would be devastating.   I hope you will be well through all your loss and if you need to talk to anyone, you know where to look. <p>Carl Sanden<p></FONT>
