: Greetings from the servant of the rose.  

: First, although I have never adventured with you, I have heard nothing but good things about you from other members of the Crimson Rose.  Concerning the Rose,  all of us here do sorely miss you.  I have heard it &quot;wailed and cried&quot; upon the guild channel…  that some want you back NOW! *grins*…   Although from the seriousness of the minute reports that we receive, it sounds like you will not be back for a while, I know that you will be back( my faith at work here ) and that we will become aquatinted and hopefully, will end up liking and respecting one another.

: Second, I wish to extend my warmest sympathies and heartfelt pangs of anguish that one who has ( In Real Life Here ) devoted her life to so much that is considered good would be brought so low by some who do not appreciate what is being brought before them.  I can honestly say that I have also been attacked in a manner similar ( according to the reports ) as you.  While I did not get harmed physically, I know through other trauma's in my life that such deeds of violence can scar both the attacker and the victim.  I do pray ( although at times scantily enough ) for you.  I pray for your physical recovery and a mental recovery from this trauma.  I do not know your spiritual belief's nor do I wish to force mine own upon you.  I will only go so far as to state that through mine and others prayers to Christ, you are being lifted up daily.

: Fare you well Aventra.  You are part of my extended family.  You are part of the Crimson Rose.  Be blessed and rise up, for the Lord of the Morning is come!
