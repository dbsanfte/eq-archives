<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Seven moons ago, Kaltar went deep into the depths of cazik thules temple to slay the infernal beasts that inhabit the foul gods domain.  That night was not to be a glorious one for the rose's champion for cazik himself apeared and slew Kaltar taking his soul for 7 suns and 7 moons so he could not reclaim his own armor and weapons. So i call on all of you to help Kaltar rise again as the proud warrior for he seems lifeless without his armor and weapons as any warrior would. I myself have prayed for him perhaps the gods will hear my plees and resserect his soul and bring his corpse back to him with his gear intact, but if i fail he needs you The Crimson Rose to help him for if our Champion is without heart or hope there is a great gap in the rose itself.<p>Signed<p><br>     A messenger</FONT>
