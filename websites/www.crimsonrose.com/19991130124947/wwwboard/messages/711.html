<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">: A high level (34 ish)guild leader (also 10 levels higher than any other member in her guild), was adventuring with members of the Crimson Rose in lower guk. Then One member (with company) also of the Crimson Rose shows up, and demands the other members to leave the party and join his or be cast from the guild) They did so, leaving this level 34 character to solo in Lower guk (to try and get out alone). She died and had to call 3 parties of level 20-25 to retreive her body. Many died, several times, and they were about to give up on the now SEVERAL bodies down there. but they endeavoured and eventually retreived the bodies after a day or so.<p>: The crimson Rose? Honourable? Not an escort out atleast instead of just abandoning?<p>: A tragic tale indeed for such a guild. Even I would not have abandoned her down there!!!<p>: Count Asurnan Thex Tier Dal Shadowknight of Neriak 3rd gate.<p></FONT>
