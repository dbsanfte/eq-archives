            Stealing will now be regarded as disruption and will result in
            disciplinary action when witnessed by any EverQuest Customer
            Service Representative (EQCSR). The EQCSR will review these situations
            on an individual basis and issue a decision which is considered
            binding upon all parties involved. Kill Stealing is defined as
            the killing of a mob for any reason that is already fighting
            or pursuing another player or group.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The intent
            of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers,
            not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those
            who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest
            Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy.</FONT></P>
            <P><U><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Contested

            are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing.
            In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. If an
            equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior
            to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will
            mandate a binding compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise
            mandated by an EQCSR will be considered disruption. It is therefore
            strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach
            a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR,
            who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent
            that a player-devised compromise would.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Note:
            A &quot;group&quot; in this case is defined as a party of one

            and are capable of completing that goal.</FONT></P>

            words, real-world racial slurs, and other language that is not
            consistent with the fantasy environment and designed to hurt,
            will be considered a disruption. The existence of the filter

            is defined as specifically targeting another player or group

            many forms, as it goes to the state-of-mind of the person or
            party on the receiving end of the action. However, in order to
            account for those who are excessively thin-skinned, the EQCSR
            involved will make a determination as to whether or not the average
            person would feel &quot;harassed&quot; and act accordingly.</FONT></P>

            Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience

            after having been instructed to do so by an EQCSR. Making excessive

            as falsely representing one&#146;s intentions to make a gain
            at another&#146;s expense. Examples of this activity include
            but are not limited to offering to recover possessions from the
            corpse of another player and refusing to return that property
            to it&#146;s owner as well as using flaws in a secure trade window

            Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct
            or Play Nice Policies may be disbanded. In addition, monopolizing
            numerous spawn areas with the intent to exclude other players
            will not be permitted. If investigated and verified by an internal
            EQCSR, monopolizing will result in the disbanding of the guild.</FONT></P>

            Servers are a special case for many of the policies listed here.
            When one makes the decision to play on a PvP Server, they are
            in essence agreeing to play on a server where compromise is decided

            PvP combat in all situations where it is called for, as a resolution
            to the problem. As such, the EverQuest Customer Service Staff
            will decline to intervene in cases where a PvP alternative exists,

            causing experience-loss to other players in the PvP environment
            is illegal in all cases and will result in a warning when witnessed
            by an EQCSR.<BR>
            This includes things such as intentionally training NPCs, and
            purposefully allowing an NPC to get the final blow in combat.
            We do understand that there are<BR>
            cases where the experience-loss is unintentional, and will take
            no action unless a person earns a reputation of causing unintentional
            experience-loss.</FONT></P>

            like how the Kill Stealing rule applies to those on the blue
            servers, this rule is designed to discourage and make note of
            those who do it habitually, thus<BR>
            betraying the spirit of PvP. As a note, the EQCSR will not in
            any case provide a resurrection for someone who was caused experience
            loss in PvP, intentionally<BR>
            or otherwise. This is one of the dangers of playing on a PvP
            server.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Though
            EverQuest is a Role-playing game, the claim of &quot;Role-play&quot;
            will not be accepted in defense of any of the antisocial behaviors
            mentioned above. As an example, you are in no case (PvP or otherwise)
            allowed to &quot;Train&quot; a guard onto an enemy in protection
            of your homeland. In another example, a rogue is not allowed
            to steal someone&#146;s corpse under the guise of role-playing
            a thief.</FONT></P>

          &quot;The immensity and richness of the Star Wars universe lends
          itself ideally to a game of this nature.&quot;</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-1">&quot;We couldn't possibly
          ask for a better universe in which to create a massively multiplayer
          game, &quot; says John Smedley, president and CEO of Verant.
          &quot;Star Wars offers such an incredible amount of depth and
          detail that we'll be able to create a place for fans to feel
          right at home. This game is going to be incredible!&quot;</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-1">&quot;Star Wars online will
          be a phenomenon that transforms online gaming for both gamers
          and casual game players,&quot; says Lisa Simpson, president of
