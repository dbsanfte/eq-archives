<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">My MotherBoard and Proccessor. Now I have a PIII450. The current card I have is a Quantum Raven.(Had this card before the upgrade and it worked fine.)

Well they did until Sal told me to get the patches for Tribes and after that it started running like crap. (THanks Sal)One of my options is to format my Harddrive and reload everyting I have on disk. There's a lot of stuff that has been thrown onto this hardrive and it needs the wipe real bad. It seems to freeze up when ever I change to a inventory screen. WEll Gotta go for now.
