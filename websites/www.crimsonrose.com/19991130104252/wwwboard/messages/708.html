<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">From what I can gather, you could take your base stats... and do some magic..  but it would be along the lines of how a ranger is implimented in EQ..   Very good with blades..  as you progress in levels, you can figure out spells, but your mana is so low that even if you knew the most powerfull spell in the game and had all the regents..  you probably would not have enough mana to actually cast it...  You are kind of stuck with the lower echelon spells even at high levels....  but.. I will let you know more as I find out more.</FONT>
