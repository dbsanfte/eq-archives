        evil troll Kanluk was spotted hiding under the docks of the city.
        Spewing vulgarities and obscenities about our guilds name, Ranger
        Emywen was quick to act and fought the foul beast just outside

        This little gnome has been tied up with real world issues but
        all that is over now and it's time to end the delusions of the
        blind who think our guild will EVER fall. &lt;please note below
        founded date of February 14, 1995&gt;<BR>
        I'll be the first to admit we are at a point of weakness without
        our King. But with him as well, real life issues have taken him
        away from the guild for a short time. Glory to the Rose my friends!</FONT></P>

        of you off gaurd, but please take my word that all of them were
        discussed by myself and the King before his departure.</FONT></P>
