After the king, the equipment should be given to the nobility and then.. to the general populace.  For with responsiblity comes duty and with duty comes privilage.

Even still, it is a family.  We of the rose are one brotherhood.  Let us stay strong.<p>And one final thing brother...

: yes,  I know who you are.   yes, I have heard your accusations.  yes, I have passed them along.  yes, I questioned.  No, I do not believe....

: To take a vow of silence.. a vow given to ones self...  I decided to keep quiet because we have a new position within the guild being filled by Lilea.  Her goal was to find out what the percieved problems were and to make sure that those problems were presented to the High Council and to the King in a manner which was condusive to bringing the change ( if needed ) or to finding out the correct answer to the unasked question of How or Why.  This silence will end for a time......

: First, I wish to state my views on how this kingdom should work.

: We have a King, Dukes, Barons, Earls and Officers. ( me notwithstanding for I am not in that order ).  Each of those members of Royalty or Nobility should be equiped with the finest that our Kingdom can afford.  If a member of the general populace does give a piece of equipment ( in this case, Cairbre's SBH ) that equipment should be alloted to one of three places.  The Treasury, the King or a member of the court.  As a Kingdom, we should take pride in making sure that our king has the finest equipment that this &quot;world&quot; has to offer.  After the king, the equipment should be given to the nobility and then.. to the general populace.  For with responsiblity comes duty and with duty comes privilage.  If you feel slighted because you are not on the recieving end of wanted or needed equipment, please feel free to show your leadership abilities and apply yourself toward becoming a leader in this guild.  The greatest way to show leadership skills is to lead.  Just do it.

: Onto your accusations...    I do hear them and I do approach the king and the Duke with every instance where I even hear of a member accusing a member of Royalty/Nobility with corruption, Even and including themselves.  

: Now, This family that you derise, is indeed a loose family.  There are several reasons why a person may or may not grieve in this day and age about death.  One reason is disbeleif.  One reason begins with the lack of physical presence that we associate with one another.  Myself,  I only know each of you via guildsay, icq, irc or email.
