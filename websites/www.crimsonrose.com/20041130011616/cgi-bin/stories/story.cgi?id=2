    <td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(<u>Vespacian</u>) It's cloudy out, and the weather looks only to be getting worse; soon. A look around the street says that this backwater town isn't real big on strangers. The new spaceport the city over may change that by force. To your left you see a sign made of wood and wrought iron. It looks like it has been up forever and makes a faint squeak as the wind picks up. The lettering on it is chipped but still legible, "The Crimson Rose". <p>Odd name you think to yourself, but doesn't seem to be anywhere else to go. A sign underneath it states, "All are welcome, even droids. Sit down and rest traveler we are all friends here." Well, that seems to be a good sign, as you walk toward it. There are no windows to the front, only a doorway. With nothing better to do you enter. There are plenty of seats and the cheery fellow behind the bar smiles and nods to you. The air has a rich smell of food, you can't put your finger on the exact aroma but you know you have had it before. The lighting could be better, as there are some corners that are dim(almost dark) but you figure what cantina worth its salt doesn't have dark corners. There are a set of stairs going to the second floor, where you hope that there are still a few rooms left. And here your story begins....<p><p>(<u>Dantrag</u>)  The bulbous head, long whiskers, wide and glazed eyes are unmistakable to the by-ped behind the counter along the far wall. He peers around eyeing the 15 or so patrons milling about the subdued lighting of his establishment known as...The Crimson Rose. Six shelves behind the counter you see rows of differant colored and differant sized bottles that seem to be filled with an assortment of liquids. This by-ped is cleaning glasses, mugs, flukes of various sizes and scanning the counter to make sure its clean and free of "drink rings". The serving droid makes its rouds to differant patrons, taking orders and bringing the ordered beverages ina timely manner. There seems to be an "aura" of satisfaction on the person behind the counter. You recognized him to be a Mon Calari. And you know his name to be...Dantrag, the proprietor of this establishment. <p>You know Dantrag to be a quiet sort...not talking much, but he always seems to be the one with the inside "scoup" on various things around town. Rumors are about that he is sympathetic towards the Rebellion, but he has been seen with Stormtroopers, apparently "giving" information, you suspect. <p><p>Dantrag eyes every patron as they come through his doors, and watches them closely until they are seated or in a "social" conversation with other patrons. Only when the Mon Calari is confident that the patron in question isn't going to cause trouble, he relaxes a little bit. He has had two deaths this month in his cantina and that is two to many. The 'troopers keep poking around thinking The Crimson Rose as a ruffian bar...waiting for another patron to die...Dantrag can't keep this up every month as it "eats" into his profits when the 'troopers fine him for the expired patron. <p><p>A little scuffle starts in a back corner between a wookie and a pair of trandshans. This aught to be good. Dantrag smiles while whispering to the rodian and human sitting at the bar, "that damn wookie! my money is on him... 3:1 in favor of the wookie...? Any bets?" <p><p>The human seems eager to take this bet with a, "you damn right I'll take that bet! Dan...yer gunna pay up this time!" <p><p>"Naw...you still owe me from the last bet we had with those dueling bothans last week....", Dantrag says with a "gurgled" chuckle, "and you only paid half that bet!" <p><p>The human replies, "Ya ya!...I got that load you wanted delivered, so I am in the creds today my friend! We'll settle up after this..." <p><p>Everyone at the bar is now peering at the trio who seem to be "sizing" each other up...<p><p>(<u>Vespacian</u>)  She walks in looking around....hmmm not much but it will have to do. You notice a Twi'lek who looks like she has been through much recently...even her leeku are drooping. She looks to see if the wait staff is present and sees none. A good sign she thinks, atleast she can stop here for a while and hopefully catch her breath. The past couple of weeks have been tough for this once prominent "entertainer" from correlia. <p>She is startled by a fight, "Great, this si one of those bars." She waits patiently for the imperial guards to come and notices that theya re not. She quickly ushers her way to the bar and sits down hopefully staying out of the way of any thrown objects. <p>"Let's see who is in charge around here....maybe I can pick up work...." She sees the mon Calari behind the Bar...She tries to pull herself together a little and will try to get this job the way she has gotten every other one...with her looks and personality. <p>" Excuse me Bartender....would you have a position open for a wayward soul." I promise not to bring any trouble and who knows my looks may be good for business?"<p><p>(<u>Dantrag</u>)  Looking up from his duties behind the bar, the Mon Calimari gives a blank expression to the young Twi`lek and motions for her to sit at the bar after quickly going around the end of the bar and rushing up to clean the top of the stool off. Satisfied that the seat is as good as it will get, he returns the way he came.<p><p>With a slight "gurgle" every other word, the bar keep asks, "You are hear looking for work? Hmmm...Not too sure you wanna work here missy, we seem to lose them as fast as we get them. Between the `troopers, Jabba's henchmen coming here to look for "talent", and hotshot space-jocks, I can't seem to keep MY talent here. I am thinking I am going to have to post a "Need a job? Come in to ask" sign."<p><p>"How about you try to break that rif-raf over there from tearing my bar up with some of your "talents" in music and dance. You DO know how to do both don't you?", as he gives a slight point to the twenty or so patrons in his bar.<p><p>Releasing what comes across as a "sigh", but is more like trying to talk under water, Dantrag mutters to the young, beautiful Twi`lek, "You get them to stop with this and you have a job, we can barter for pay later. Now I have other customers to attend to, but I will be observing from back here. Oh ya, any profits you get from patrons for your perfromances, 20% comes to the house, you get the rest. That is on top of whatever pay we arrange later."<p><p>With that, Dantrag goes back to taking drink orders, giving a yell towards the back of the establishment trying to get someone out front to help him.<p><p>(<u>Vespacian</u>)  Meanwhile..."Stop that scuffle," she thinks to herself, "what does he want me to do next, make the empire endorse smugglers."  She gets up from the stool and puts on her brightest face.  She adjusts her leeku in just the right fashion.  She is going through her mental notes as to the best way to handle the Trandoshans...Wookies atleast will occassionally listen to reason.  She hops up on the table nearest the tussle and kicks a glass off to get the combatants attention.  Some liquid hits the nearest Trandoshan's foot and he growls menacingly at her.  Now that she has their attention she begins moving her arms in a fluid motion in conjunction with her hips."Are these guys even interested in my type," she thinks.  She gives herself over to the rhythems she is creating around her.  The aura of tranquility despite the fact that the bar is still very active.  Other patron notice this impromptu performance and begin to watch.  Most of the crowd around her seem to be mellowing out and begin to sway with her as she gets her leeku involved.  Trying to remember all the steps that will hopefully keep her audience and more importantly the troublemakers involved she looks directly at the nearest trandoshan and begins flicking her leeku.  He(atleast she thinks it is a he) looks arounds momentarily and grabs his drink and begins talking calmly with his partner.  The Wookie lets out a quiet growl and goes back to his corner and resumes his meal.  The sounds of eating and even some laughter can be heard in this normally reserved bar.  She comes back to her senses after letting the dance come over her and looks around.  She hops off the table and begins walking up to the bar when suddently three imperial soldiers storm in blasters at the ready.  Quickly she jumps under the table and pulls a chair in fornt of her.  "Oh great what are these clods looking for."<p><p>(<u>Dantrag</u>)  "Where is Dantrag!" demands a white suit of armor whose skull like helmet scans the lobby from the doorway of The Crimson.<p><p>The three Stormtroopers enter confidantly into the lobby heading in the direction of the bar and push past a few patrons as others scurry out of the way for fear of being noticed.<p><p>"I won't ask again...Where is Dantrag!" the `trooper with the bright orange shoulder cover spouts with a very deep and authoritative voice, as the other two `troopers follow the apparent leader of the trio.<p><p>The only Mon Calimari near the bar hastily raises his webbed hand into the air and gurgles out, "I am here lieutenant. What is it can I do for you? Would you like some of my fine fine Corellian Wine? I just got..."<p><p>"NO!" was the reply that cut off Dantrag in mid-sentance. "I am not here to doddle with you this time! We are looking for a criminal and rebel sympathizer! We are posting signs in here and if you have seen this person, you are ordered to give her over to us immediately!"<p><p>With a dumb-founded look and an obvious look of confusion, "I can assure you lieutenant, no such person is in my establishment. I don't serve criminals here as per your directive upon opening of my shop. And I am a law abiding citizen and follow laws to the letter of it."<p><p>While the conversation was getting "down to business", the other two `troops veered from the back of the leader and started to waltz around the bar confidantly looking at the faces of the patrons.<p><p>One of the `troopers was heading to the back of the lobby, where the "new talent" fled under a table, when Dantrag suddenly moved from around the bar with his arm outstretched and "accidently" knocked two bottles of wine to the floor with a loud "crash".<p><p>Everyone in the bar was startled at that moment and citizens ducked to the floor and the Stormtroopers readied their weapons in that direction when everyone looked in the direction of the sudden noise.<p><p>Dantrag, with both webbed hands high in the air was yelling, "IT WAS ME! I knocked over some of my wine bottles! It was me! I accidently knocked over...my wine bottles."<p><p>At that moment, almost in unison, all the patrons let go a sigh of relief and all three Stormtroops moved to the disturbance at the end of the bar.<p><p>"Alright Dantrag. Everything seems to be in order here. But you keep your eyes open and report back to us if you see anything suspicious!" was the last thing the Stormtroopers said with a poke to the Mon Calimari's chest and a swift turn on his heels and headed to the exit...</font></td>
