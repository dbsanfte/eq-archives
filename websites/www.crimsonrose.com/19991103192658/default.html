            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">As you
            well know, there are some changes that are going on within our
            ranks. These changes are not uncommon as we try to better ourlseves
            as a group. Some accept the change, and some fear it. History
            has taught us that when people fear something, they tend to destroy
            it, or at least make the attempt. As such the case here and now.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">I have
            given a list of a few names to the leaders recently to have a
            few members removed from our ranks. These reasons I have shared
            with the leadership, so there is no need to go into them here
            with you now. Suffice to say, the leadership will be available
            to listen to your complaints and 'arguments' on why you wish
            to return to us. But there are a few, that i will not allow back
            in. Under any circumstances.</FONT></P>

            acknowledge, that I can not please 100% of the people, 100% of
            the time. So I must please as many as I can whenever possible.
            So, with this said, there are going to be rumors, hate /tells
            and the like coming from some people. Most of this is about me.
            I have dealt withthis before, and I am sure that I will deal
            with it in the future. I also fully know and accept, that whenever
            I am not around, the wind or whisperings happen about me, about
            how I rule this guild, and the like. I also know that this wind
            can be harsh at times. Believe me when I say, I have a pretty
            thick skin and that I am a big boy and can handle it.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Many
            of you know, that I rarely ever respond to 'hate mail', whether
            it be on the message board, or sent via email. However, this
            one stricks me odd, and as such, was surprised to read it. I
            am encouraging a discussion to begin on the message aboard about
            this. I am open to your thoughts. And believe it or not, I can

          <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Hello
          there. This is the player of Kurgan on Karana. I was wondering
          if you would mind posting the following message in the news section
          of the CR site. I think this petition is a good one and stands
          a good chance of working.</FONT></P>

          for your consideration...<BR>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-1">Greetings fellow EverQuesters!</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-1">I currently represent a large
            number of players who would very much like to see the addition
            of a role-play only server. A few players will claim that the
            server they play on is for role-playing. However, it becomes
            obvious, after a time, that they are truly all the same. The
            reality is that the role-players themselves are the minority
            on any given server. If we had a server that was tagged as &quot;Role-play
            only,&quot; it would give all of us (with this particular style
            of play) an advertised place where we could fully enjoy our EverQuest
            experience. There is no question that a role-play only server
            would be used to its full extent since it would draw from this
            minority rather than have us spread out over all of the other
            servers. That is essentially what we would like to prove to the<BR>
            staff of EverQuest with this petition.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-1">However, this petition is
            not just for role-players. The Hack 'n Slash style players would
            also benefit from the addition of a role-play only server. The
            most obvious benefit would be the virtual elimination of arguments
            and resentments between the players with these drastically differing
            styles. I am referring to many situations that include, misuse
            of OOC, Shout and Auction commands, begging people for &quot;buffs,&quot;
            open discussion of inappropriate topics (i.e., that aren't genre
            specific), et cetera. A role-play only server may also eventually
            lead to a reduction of strictness or necessity concerning some
            of the controversial &quot;Play Nicely&quot; rules.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-1">If, in fact, the goal of the
            EverQuest staff is to ensure an enjoyable gaming environment
            for all of the players, a role-play only server would seem like
            a very logical step toward accomplishing that goal. If you are
            in agreement with us or you simply feel that this suggestion
            is reasonable, please email us at </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"><A

            forward all of the responses (along with this petition) to the
            EverQuest staff in the hopes that they too will see the logic
            behind our request.</FONT></P>
