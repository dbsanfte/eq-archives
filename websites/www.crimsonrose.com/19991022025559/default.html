          reason I went that<BR>
          direction is to let those members who are newer to the guild,
          and those who have grievances against some of us.. that we are
          human also. We have good<BR>
          days but we also have bad ones. In specific... Cirith. I am glad
          that I was able to finally understand that you needed time *
          Kirel shows off his<BR>
          stone skull *. Jinni.. * frowns*... I used you as an example
          because... that was most recent in my mind. To tell the truth,
          I hear<BR>
          people complaining to me about Dantrag more often than anybody.
          *big smile for the lady wood elf *. I personally have immensely
          enjoyed your company<BR>
          on those times when we were able to speak and talk. I know that
          life does not always permit it. Dantrag, Don't worry sire, I
          will be subtle when<BR>
          I need to be and not, when not ( points to the other night ).
          Korfallen and all the other leaders... We are all human. I would
          suggest that if<BR>
          we became closer as friends then when problems arise ( like the
          one that Cirith and I had ... and I will admit that it was a
          bad one and mostly my<BR>
          fault.. wasn't it Cirith :-) ) Then we can grow from our mistakes
          rather than holding onto the anger. Likewise, when someone has
          a grudge against<BR>
          you, as hard as it is, admit that they have a valid case. Because
          from their point of view, they do. Sometimes just the act of
          admitting that, (<BR>
          not that you were wrong ) will allow healing to take place. Sometimes
          it takes you to be the better man/woman and admit fault even
          when you do not<BR>
          think that you were at fault. Sometimes saving the friendship
          is more important than being trivial about fault.</FONT></P>

          16 -<BR>
          19ish.. I told you that I was surprised that you had not already
          achieved a level closer to 30. You responded back then, that
          you were more interested<BR>
          in helping guild members. Cirith, I am .. and have been very
          surprised to see you trundle across 2 continents just to give
          me a symbol of pinzarn ( sp<BR>
          ) or something. I know that in the past I have offended you greatly.
          I know that you and I wanted the other to leave the guild. Heh..
          I am sure<BR>
          that our own similar natures prevented us from leaving. I am

            ownership transfer of accounts, characters, items (except for
            in-game trading/selling/buying), and any other game related properties
            are expressly forbidden. Doing so is in violation of the License,
            done at your own risk, and we (989 Studios/Sony Online Entertainment/Verant)
            are not responsible for any issues resulting from such a transaction,
            including but not limited to fraud, sales of banned or suspended

            This is a reminder that the following zones/encounter types are
            high risk and may result in irretrievable corpses: The Plane
            of Fear, Dragon Encounters (Vox/Nagafen), and the forthcoming
            zones, the Plane of Hate and the Plane of Sky. Should members
            of your party fall in battle it may be extremely difficult, if
            not impossible, to recover their corpses (for example, they might
            be at the feet of a big red dragon). GMs and Guides can only
            help with Corpse Retrievals if there is a bug involved, and while
            this is true for all areas in the game, because of the extreme
            danger of the Planes and Dragon Encounters, we felt it important
            to remind our players of these issues.</FONT></P>

            This is a reminder that some NPCs are part of what we call 'encounter
            tables', in which only one encounter (NPC(s)) are present at
            any given time. Thus, while searching for rare and hidden NPCs
            throughout the world, it may be necessarily to slay common NPCs
            in the area you are searching in order to get the rare NPC to
            appear.</FONT></P>

              everyone,</FONT></P>
              <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Brad
              invited me to fill in this week, as the topic for the Producer&#146;s
              Letter was customer service-related. I would like to take this
              opportunity to give everyone an overview of the policy enhancements
              we are planning for EverQuest Customer Service.</FONT></P>
              <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Our original
              policies were designed to preserve EverQuest&#146;s high-fantasy
              online role-playing environment. Like EverQuest itself, many
              of these policies were innovative, having never before been pursued
              in massively multiplayer online gaming. Although some were skeptical,
              we were committed to our naming and guilding policies, and to
              controlling more serious problems like harassment and abuse.
              Our basic customer service philosophy could be summed up with
              this statement &quot;One player should never be permitted to
              intentionally ruin the play experience of another&quot;. EverQuest
              was created and maintained with that simple concept in mind.
              We have learned a lot in the seven months since EverQuest launched.
              Armed with that experience, we are ready to commit to an even
              higher level of service.</FONT></P>
              <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">We are
              referring to these changes as the &quot;Play Nice Policies&quot;.
              It is our intent to further define our responsibilities as EverQuest
              customer service representatives, and to provide resolutions
              when players come into conflict over in-game issues. The policy
              changes will directly affect how and when we will mediate for
              players in dispute. When the policies are implemented, our staff
              will be taking action to diffuse situations before they become
              so frustrating that a player&#146;s enjoyment of the game is
              compromised. One of the most serious concerns that we often hear
              from players is that Guides and GM&#146;s cannot always provide
              help. In these situations we will now be able to assist.</FONT></P>
              <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Before
              I delve into the policy changes, there is a point I would like
              to stress. EverQuest players are encouraged to make every effort
              to interact positively and cooperate with their fellow gamers.
              Our firm commitment to this ideal is reflected in these policies.
              Players who wish to destroy the gaming experience of others are
              not welcome in EverQuest, and will be removed from the game without
              hesitation.</FONT></P>

              when witnessed by any GM or Guide. The GM or Guide will review
              these situations on an individual basis and issue a decision
              which is considered binding upon all parties involved. This may
              include a requirement to depart the immediate zone or spawn area.
              Kill Stealing is defined as attacking an NPC with the intent
              to deprive another player or group of the experience or loot
              from that NPC. This practice commonly occurs in popular spawn
              areas. In these instances, the player or group who was first
              on the scene will have the rights to the kill. Players are encouraged
              to cooperate in these situations!</FONT></P>

              when confirmed by a GM. An example of this activity would be
              offering to recover the possessions from the corpse of another
              player, and refusing to return that property to it&#146;s owner.
              Secure Trade Window Circumvention involving the sale of items
              in-game between players will also be prohibited and punishable
              under this rule.</FONT></P>

              the Right of Way</FONT><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">
              is an issue where players choose to camp spawn sites (usually
              for treasure) where the monsters do not provide experience. This
              problem is initially being addressed in a broad plan involving
              changes to popular spawn areas and the inclusion of new quests.
              If and when we are comfortable with the success of these changes,
              we will consider the implementation of the Yield rule. This will
              require higher-level players or groups to yield to lower-level
              players in any situation where the NPC&#146;s being fought consider
              green to the higher-level players. Due to the controversial nature
              of this issue, we will be conducting a comprehensive poll on
              this specific subject.</FONT></P>
              <P><FONT COLOR="#999999" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">In the
              PvP+ environment, several issues will now be included in the
              definition of harassment. Bind Point Camping, or the practice
              of killing a player multiple times at his or her bind point.
              Corpse Camping, in which players lie in wait (often invisible
              or hidden) to kill another player who is returning to loot their
              corpse after a death. Zone Border Camping, which occurs when
              players attack other players before they obtain control of their
              character after crossing a zone boundary.</FONT></P>
              <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="-2" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Disciplinary
              issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a broader basis.
              Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct
              may be disbanded. In addition, Monopolizing numerous spawn areas
              with the intent to exclude other players will not be permitted.
              If investigated and verified by a GM, Monopolizing will result
              in the disbanding of the guild.</FONT></P>

          <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We are excited to announce the implementation
          of the new &quot;Optional&quot; patch system. This new system
          will allow players to download new optional files such as ones,
          music, character animations, etc. After the EverQuest executable
          is run (everquest.exe), and once the download is complete, you
          will receive an option to patch the &quot;optional&quot; files.
          If &quot;Yes&quot; is selected, the optional files will begin
          downloading, if &quot;No&quot; is selected, you will bypass the
          optional files and continue. Please note that this optional patch
          requestor will appear every time everquest.exe is run.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In addition to the optional patch program,
          the following changes and enhancements have been made:</FONT></P>

          for group aggregate damage. This is now true for ALL servers.
          We still consider this change in 'TEST' and will conduct a poll
          as to whether it positively addresses the kill stealing situation
          in approximately 2 weeks.<BR>
          - As mentioned on Saturday, Rubicite armor will no longer spawn.
          The new class specific quests to obtain the new armor are now
          in for each class that could wear Rubicite.<BR>
          - Journeyman's Boots will no longer spawn where they did but
          rather are the products of a quest.<BR>
          - To address trade fraud (players removing items/money immediately
          prior to trading to deceive the other player), items/money may
          only be removed by clicking on the &quot;Cancel&quot; button.<BR>
          - When receiving a text message from either an NPC or PC speaking
          in a language other than &quot;Common Tongue&quot;, if the user's
          language skill is high enough, the language being spoken will
          be noted preceding the text.<BR>
          - The fishing pole will now appear in the player's hand whenever
          the fishing skill is used.<BR>
          - A number of quests were both added and enhanced throughout
          the zones.</FONT></P>

          Chant of Frost (BARD) have all had their effects slightly increased.<BR>
          - The Burnout Series (Magicians) has had the negative HP component
          reduced (improvement) and the stat buff increased (improvement).
          Because of this, the spells are no longer permanent - they now
          have a 15 minute duration. Burnout III has also had its casting
          cost reduced.<BR>
          - Illusion: Werewolf attack speed component now works as intended.<BR>
