<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><br>My dear Aventra...i too work with detention youth and am aware of how fast an unprovoked attack can occur. Just know that I send my prayers for you and also for the "thugs", that they may actually become aware of the horrible deed that they have performed on such a caring individual as you; I also hope that they dont slip through the cracks in the system and "get away with it". Take care and obey the doctor's orders...hurry back to your family in the Crimson Rose.    JINNI</FONT>
