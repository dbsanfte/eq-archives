<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">: You want the king and nobles to be outfitted like gods, then so be it. If you want to show no companionship to soth for his lose, then so be it. But how do you explain the childish manner he dealt with Infestus, or when he lied about helping get back the black chain of one of the members, not a vague lie, a direct lie. He lied to someone who trusted him. As for showing who I am, no one cares who I am anymore. <p>"Outfitted like gods...." interesting phrase and choice of words.  I ask you first of all, what is wrong with this and second, why should it be any different?  The highest ranking has traditionally received the most responsibility and as a reward for handling said responsibility is a better life in general.  Running a sucessful guild takes a lot of work and out of game time to do properly.  Why else would some one sacrifice hours each night to think of great things to do, generate a great web site and maintain it etc if it is all for naught?  You speak as if the leaders of a good guild are nothing better than the members.  As far as time and commitment, I beg to differ.<p>As to your acusations?  What can I say?  It pretty much boils down to several factors.  A) who I trust more, you or Dantrag, B) which side has the most verifiable validity and C) the character of the person in question.<p>Hands down, because of the length of time I have watched this guild, I trust Dantrag.  I have watched this guild for years, longer than Kirel even, and know of its honor from various members.<p>Which side's story is most verifiable?  Considering the nature of the charges it is difficult to be sure of validity without screenshots.  Infestus's remarks may have been in tells, something no one but Dantrag would have witnessed.  You were not present when Dantrag and the other person talked about Blackened armor.  The incident with the SBH is described to vaguely that no one can identify it.  Since nothing is really verifiable, we must rely upon trust and the next item.<p>Character.  Integrity.  Honesty.  Do you think of yourself as having these qualities?  Why did you sneak away and start your own guild based upon pure evil and PK?  I know all about the Children of Innoruk guild you and a few others have begun.  Honestly?  It goes against everything CR stands for.  Is this spite or plain petulance?  You simply vanish, leaving your post, responsibilities and friends without a word of farewell.  I am to believe your words?  Your character is worthless and, as such, so are your words.<p>Slink away, once more, Ronfare.  Return no more to these halls for you are not welcome here.  All you seem to seek is to stir up dissention and hatred.  Seems your new guild is aptly named, child of Innoruk.  <p>Begone!<p>Earl Korfallen Ardgael</FONT>
