<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">...I will likewise release thee.  For I truly know how losing someone...two someones, can impact one's life.  I also know how the support, caring and love of a few in our guild family is helping me get through this.  I respect and garner what ever limitations ye feel thee needs to put on yourself as a way to make some sense of all this.  But please, never forget, that an unbreakable bond that shall exist for all eternity has been formed between us!  That of having loved, and lost, the same people. Do not grieve in solitude... for the pain needs to be shared, so that the burden might be carried by many to tighten the load.  I love ye, Adrikan Soth... brother of mine!  Do not stay away too long, for I need thee!</FONT>
