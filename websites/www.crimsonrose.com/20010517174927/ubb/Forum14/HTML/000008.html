</FONT><HR>This is a copy of Apocress's post from the "Everquest" thread...<P>"First off Wolftooth if you have something to say about us please just come out and say it. Karabella and I are together on this one. We have not posted because we noticed that Dan did not post the WHOLE situation about what happened that night. Second, to be honest we are too afraid to voice our opinion on the matter being that we disagree with the whole thing in getting us kicked out of the guild as well for simply voicing our opinion. So Kara and I have decide to keep our mouths shut being that is the only way to be safe. We (especially myself) are tired of getting yelled at every time I voice my opinion on a matter. So I have learned to shut my mouth."<P>Now for my two cents.<P>I have yet to see a post from Karabella on anything dealing what whatever it is you may say on a subject. Yet, you almost always seem to say that you speak for Karabella as well and that she seems to think the same as you.<P>As far as posting everything that happened with regards to Trilkin. Yes, your right, I did not post everything word for word, however, the paraphrase is quite accurate.<P>Since I had to deal with someone else several weeks ago, you chimed in and had to challenge me almost at every turn since. And since we (you and I) had a short exchange, you seem to think that no one likes you and everyone hates you. Your only partially right. Sorry to break it to you. But not everyone you meet will like you. That's just the way it goes. But seeing, what appears to me, you are asking people almost on a daily basis to do, is show pity on you and shower you with praise for things. Then when you get this praise or pity from the members, you seem to take it with a grain of salt and not believe them. Then the process seems to repeat itself. I dont believe there is ONE person in this guild that has EVER said they don't like you or "hate" you. This I strongly believe, is a figment of your own imagination.  I, however, am getting tired of your little jabs at me and subliminal message you do while in game and on this board. It is getting old. Please stop. If you are SOOOOO unhappy here, why stay with us. There has ALWAYS been an open door policy with this guild. If someone is not content, they leave. It's that simple. Do I want you to leave? No. There is no reading into that question either. It is simply a plain old two letter word. No. No strings attached and there shouldn't be any room for ambiguity whatsoever here. Simple word, No.<P>As far as your jabs at me. You yet again are twisting my words around, and this pisses me off the most. I have NEVER tried to stiffle anyone in this guild from thier opinions. But I hold a certain rank in this guild. If you cant treat this rank with some respect when speaking to this rank, then you can leave. Feel free to tell me whatever you wish, I dont care if you want to tell me to screw off, just do it with some respect if you wish to stay in this guild. I shouldnt have to be talking about this though. This should be the case with ANY guildmember.<P>In short. Please stop the jabs at me in game and out. Please stop thinking the world is against you and get pro-active, in a positive manner. Stop challenging my dicisions, but instead question them. The problem has never been what you said to me Apocress, its always been HOW you said it to me. You may not like the person holding the rank. But at least repect the rank if not the person.<P>------------------<BR>-= Let Your Imagination Be Your Guide And Always Follow Your Heart In All Things =-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=000008.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Getting+Irritated.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#333333">

</FONT><HR>I think the problem is some people are just to Poltically Correct.  People expressing opion is a good thing, worry about what others think about them is a bad thing.<P>It does the Guild no good arguing about stupid little things.  If two people want to have a debate do it tells or email.<P>I didn't join a guild to listen to all this squabbleing.  I joined to group with Guildmembers when I could,help those I could, and have a place to get help when needed.<P>So with that said, Lets stop fighting among our selves and start grouping togther more.  With that in mind I'm gonna post to see whats happening this weekend and to try to get there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=000008.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Getting+Irritated.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#666666">

</FONT><HR>Dantrag regarding what you said about showing a message and that Apocress always thinks the same way I do.  I have felt I have never needed to post anything considering we discuss different matters  before posting or saying anything on ANY subject. When she feels something is wrong, she explains it to me in a way I can understand. Sometimes I feel differently on a subject and that is when I let her know where I am coming from. That is why some posts are opinionated and some aren't.  Everyone has their own opinion and everything is questionable in life. Some people may not agree with some stuff, but this is just one of the many times that I agree with her about this subject.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=000008.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Getting+Irritated.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#333333">

</FONT><HR>Pity? No hon, it is called feeling alone in a guild as to where I am supposed to have friends.  You are right in a sense, I do seek it out because I am trying to let the guild KNOW I FEEL THIS WAY and maybe give me an acknowledgement that I do have some friends in the guild.  It makes me feel a little more wanted.  Because you're right, I am not feeling that I have a whole lot of friends in this guild, and this is only because I feel that you and I seem to always argue about things and with you being the guild master you post things and I can never win, thus making me look bad and making me feel like shit.  I have said this before and I am going to say it again.  I love this guild and all the potential it has.  It has many nice, wonderful people in it and there is a always some guild cooperation going on somewhere, and that makes for a good, no great guild.  I just can't seem to get along with the most important person in the guild, the guild master.  I am a very opinionated and emotional person, just like most girls, but unlike most, I speak up and let people know how I feel.  Sometimes I make it come out in a smart-ass remark, but that is just me.  It is just another way that I like to let others know how I feel.  That is just who I am, take me for who I am.  I act for no one.  Maybe that is why I have a hard time getting along with you.  I don't act nor hide feelings.  With you being the Guild master you think it is a direct insult or action against you, which is not always the case.  <P>------------------<BR>Apocress<BR><B><A HREF="http://www.kcsrealm.com/cheekas" TARGET=_blank>Ayonae Ro Cheeka</A></B><p>[This message has been edited by Apocress (edited 03-30-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=000008.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Getting+Irritated.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#666666">

I've met uber guilds better then this, and that's rather sad.<P>To the rest of you, I don't know what to say. I don't want to insult everyone by saying it's stupid to stay, so I won't. Either way, it doesn't matter to me. Although if anyone decides to goto Jessamyn about me, there WILL be hell to pay. If you have something to say about me, say it TO me.<P>Thank you, drive through. <P>------------------<BR>But I, in truth, have been once here before: that savage witch Erichte, she who called the shades back to their bodies, summoned me. My flesh had not been long stripped off when she had me descend through all the rings of Hell, to draw a spirit back from the Betrayer's circle. That is the deepest and the darkest place, the farthest from the heaven girds all: so rest assured, I know the pathway all...<P>Trilkin Sunweaver, 30th Mask of Hatred</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=000008.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Getting+Irritated.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#333333">

I attempt to live up to my name and treat everyone with respect and with the highest honor.<BR>    I expect to see respect for one another in game. I resent people sending gossipy tells about one another - This BTW - Has never been done by Dan (that I have seen) I have asked him in the past, what happened with this person or that, and he attempts to protect those that he got in to it with.<P>        All I ask is that you give your mates the benefit of the doubt rather than jumping into these Paraniod Schizophrenic Tyraids about the Big Man, and his big power, and others with concern of being booted for no reason -THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN.<BR>    I, However would beg for the booting of anyone who attempted to publicly grandstand or humiliate another member, this I have seen and It is buggin me HIGHLY! <BR>     If anyone has something to ask Dan, tell Dan......, email the man, attempt to deal with it in private, but dang, some people have no respect the way that they put their misconstued presuppositions up on a board for public display! <BR>     I wanna know that you people are watchin my back, and my leaders back, not waiting for the first chance to stick a dagger in it. ISN'T THAT WHAT WE ALL WANT? <BR>    It starts with me, and It starts with you! Do something nice for a guildmate today, and tell him to tell nobody of it!

</FONT><HR>Fine then, Tril...I will say it to you, and I hope you F-----G listen.  If you weren't on some idiotic streak of righteous indignation, I think you'd realize that the topic was locked down and MOVED to rants and raves...HERE!  The issue wasn't closed, it was moved.  As for you're statement about meeting "uber-guilds better than this one" I really think you know BUPKIS about this guild as your membership lasted, what...a few months?  You don't know shit, so lets just leave it at that. One more thing...Usually, if something doesn't matter to someone, THEY DON'T BOTHER DEALING WITH IT.  Your continued presence and claims that you "keep tabs" is contradictory to your statement that it doesn't matter to you.<P>Thank you, drive off a f-----g cliff.<P>As for Apocress and Karabella:  Girls...I honestly wanted you both to enjoy this guild, and I meant what I said to you when we spoke in the Greater Faydark...I honestly think this guild is the best.  And, I'm not sure if you got my e-mail, if not...I'll resend it.  But, I RESPECT your tendency to speak your mind and order you, as an officer, to continue to do so.  You WILL NOT be kicked out for doing nothing more than being opinionated. I promise you that...Remember, yer under my protection!  <IMG SRC="http://www.crimsonrose.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Ahh, feels much better....Like Alka-Seltzer...But wait...there's more:<P>This is degrading into a pathetic flame-war...I don't like flame-wars, they make me upset and I don't NEED anymore grief in my life!! =P  Therefore, I respectfully suggest that if you want to ARGUE, take it elsewhere...If you want to DEBATE...then please carry on.  And oh yes...There IS a difference: Maturity.<P>One last thing Tril (Providing you haven't begun writing what I expect to be a SCATHING rebuttal laced with words not heard outside of a bar filled with sailors): I've respected and liked you from the beginning.  I STILL like you, but sometimes it's better the fade away than to explode.  It steams me when people come and shoot off their mouth for no other reason than to be inflammatory, and that's what this is.<P>------------------<BR>All the movies show that our worst enemies come from outer space, but all the talk shows, sitcoms, news shows, and live broadcasts show that our worst enemies are, actually, ourselves.<P>And now for something completely different...<P>"Thank you, said the queen, like a lah-de-dah poofdah!"      -Eric Idle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=000008.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Getting+Irritated.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#333333">

</FONT><HR>Aprocess, all Dantrag has been asking is that you be polite, and talk to people (yes, including him) in a civil tone.  Instead of being on the offense and point-blank accusing people of things they may or may not be guilty of, just calmly collect all the facts and *then* make a decision.  Doing so is not "acting for someone", its just common decency.  And if you can't show common decency to your fellow guild mates, *then* you may have a reason to be concerned of "the wrath," but just giving an opinion in a calm, polite manner without flaming someone show give no reason to fear.  If you give curtesy, you will get nothing but curtesy back from anyone in this guild.<P>Trilkin, well...  I feel sorry for ya man.  We've had kids like you before who leave all disgruntled because you acted your age and got your wrist slapped for it.  Yeah, probably embarassing, but honestly you are only embarassing yourself more with your outbursts instead of proving what a big person you are.  I'm still trying to figure out how moving a rants thread to the rants section is censorship.  A clue my friend, you really need to find a clue...  If you enjoy playing EQ, then please consider your actions.  The people who are here also want simply to enjoy a good game.  For you to come in here because your pride has been bruised and attempt to take away this guilds members enjoyment of the game is beyond childish, selfish, and immature.  Consider your words carefully before you utter them, and remember that those listening are just people who dont deserve your abuse.  There are only a couple of people are you mad at, please dont sit here and try to make 20something other people who are just here to have fun suffer as well.  Deal with your issue with the people you have the issues with, and let the innocent masses play the game and have some fun doing it.  If they enjoy the companionship of the other guild members, you really dont have a right to tell them they are wrong.  To each his own, respect that.<P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=000008.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Getting+Irritated.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#666666">

</FONT><HR>If anyone is wondering where Apocress and I are, well we are taking break from all this chaos that is going on in this guild.  It is all getting a little old.  We may not be back for a while or may not come back at all. We are debating on whether or not to come back to EQ in general finding out that even surrounded by good people, you can still find yourself frustrated with idiotacy.  This has as all gone much too far, and other then showing compassion for one another you ALL (yes all) are raging and pointing the fingers.  Apocress and I have kept quiet throughout most of this because when someone posts (especially poor Nikki) they get flamed, even if the post was a good one.  Nikki and I are getting very frustrated because we remember when we use to read nice fun posts and have some fun with most of you, and now, all we read is chaos.  We love this guild and we hope this gets resolved, but until it is we will not be back.  This is after all just a game and we are meant to have fun in the game and not get stressed out over trivial matters. <P> I Just have one more thing to say to guild leaders/officers.  You guys seems to want to force a "act more mature" policy to be in this guild, then you guys should all JUST STOP JOINING EVERYONE WHO WANTS IN THE GUILD!  You all do no backgrounds check, no references, nor force them to read and agree to a Rules of Conduct.  Sure you have it up there to read but I find that most of the new members don’t even know we have a website.  With this in mind, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL THEM HOW TO ACT IN THE GUILD if you have not set down rules to them.  You just let them in because they want in, and then later say "oh read the rules." and hope that they do.  If you want to force people to “act more mature” in this guild, stop taking just anyone who wants to join and make them agree to a stupid RoC just to join this guild.  I think it is lame to have to resort to this but you all are getting on the topic of acting more mature but have no leg to stand on when you join just anyone with out laying rules FIRST.  I remember Dan stating that by joining the guild you agree to the terms.  Well that is not how to do it.  Make them read it first and then let them decide if the guild is right for them with the “act more mature rules.”  Remember that EQ is a game and yes there are young people that do play this game.  You can’t expect the younger players to be the most mature players in EQ, they are young.  If you want to have everyone have like that only let players 18 or over join.   Cirith Silverstrike, you said this, “We've had kids like you before who leave all disgruntled because you acted your age and got your wrist slapped for it.”  This comment is asinine and proves my point exactly.  You cannot expect people, especially younger players to be the most mature.  Give them a break they are young and are PLAYING A GAME.  For you to say that is only proving that you expect everyone in the game to be wonderful and to be perfectly Mature players.  That is not the case because there are kids who play, and yes, some do add some adolescent and juvenal behavior you MUST expect them because there is no age set in the guild nor in the game.<P>With this being said, Apocress and I have meant NO harsh words towards anyone and how that we all can find a way to get along.  Til then we will be absent.<P>TTFN<BR><P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=000008.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Getting+Irritated.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#333333">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Kara on this one. We do need some sort of admission policy relating to new members understanding the rules and expectations of the guild. Kicking someone out (not that it's happened to my knowledge just a "for instance") because they broke a rule they didnt know about, then saying you should know about the rules because you agreed to them when joining a guild, when they had no opportunity to their knowledge to read them, is pretty absurd. Its like being kicked out of a store for breaking a policy you didnt know existed let alon agreed to.<P>------------------<BR>God <I>was</I> my co-pilot, then he crashed us into the Andes and I ate him.<P>You have become better at being a lamer (999,999,999,999)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=000008.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Getting+Irritated.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#666666">

</FONT><HR>I just want Trilkin, Kara, Apocress, and anyone else who actually reads this he said/she said, "there are better uber guilds out there", "Just 'cuz you run the guild doesn't mean you can run the guild" garbage to know that I love you all. You are always welcome to hang out in the Faerie camp with me and eat all the psylocibin mushrooms you can stomach. Just remember that in there it is La-La-Land...and when you are AFK it means you have to face the real world. To me, EQ is just a game. To those of you who take it too far, I can understand the anguish you feel when you are too bleary-eyed to go on, and have to go to work because if you call in sick one more time, you will get fired and will have no money to pay for your credit card that has your EQ account on it. I can see how that kind of stress might get to a person and make them overly-sensitive, paranoid, or just downright mean at times. I don't post as much as I should, and 98% of our current members weren't members when I used to post regularly. I wish you (the "unhappy"(?) ones) would have taken the time to get to know me, and other guild members a little better before coming to the conclusions I see posted here. And, I would hope that if most of our members are reading this thread (please tell me most of them don't! please!) I hope that they don't become negative, or unhappy, but instead, try to interact even MORE with other members, to see what this guild is really all about. We've done screening in the past. It was a source of much headache, and just as much dissent as not screening. We, as a guild, took as much flaming from that as we are now...perhaps more. Why did we stop? It had something to do with the fact that we did not think it were possible to surmise just how mature, forgiving, and reasonable a person (not character...when truly roleplaying, many things can be overlooked---please don't take that as a total liberty, however.) really was unless something they really didn't like or agree with (just like this) came up. This being a role-playing guild compounds this difficulty. Hmm...I guess what I tried to say in the first place before my eyes were captivated by a lovely woodnymph just outside my vision, was...I care. About you, about Dantrag, about this guild. I am a pretty sensitive person, too, but I am not able to "hate" anyone. If I see you, I will most likey stop and say "hail", or just as quickly cast a "buff" on you, cackle gleefully, and run off. If you don't like one person in the guild, please don't lump the rest of us in the same category. You hurt us all by even publicly displaying your negative feelings like some twisted Jerry Springer spin-off. Please don't claim to be "keeping quiet" about it, then post over and over again, still claiming to "have forgotten about it" whilst in reality you are just keeping it going. Well, there is my 2 months worth of rant...or is it a rave? I am not sure which...just that it took about 2 months of saving to put one together.<P>Silmarius Stormheart<BR>Elven Enchanter<P>-"To know others, you must first truly know yourself, and with that knowledge in hand, no one can ever tell you who you are, for you will already be." <BR>  -a faerie oracle<P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=14&topic=000008.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Getting+Irritated.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PST (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000008&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.crimsonrose.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000008&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
