The Asian city of Shoushi is surrounded on all sides by a thin 3 meter-high wall. Shoushi is definately larger than many other towns in Dereth, but it is still dwarfed when compared to such oddities as Qeynos. Keep in mind, though, that this world is huge, and all attempts to reach the Aluvian cities in the far north have ended in disaster for me. Perhapse greater things can be found there.<br>The land overall feels much more...real, than that of Norrath. My adventures between the portals have taken me to several extremely different lands. I have been in wide open plains, deserts, forrests, swamps, and even to the scourged Direlands. I have seen massive breathtaking waterfalls, been atop a mountain so high I could not see the lands below. I have fought Shreths, Drudges, Skeletons, Wood Golems, and Black Rabbits. Most amazingly, however, is that the spawning points have spawning points. Drudge camps move, and Drudges only spawn around Drudge camps. When the sun rises, and sets again, the camps have moved to a new location. My Blademaster, Talyena, has been adventuring with an AC guild known as the Red Wizards, lead by Zhentarim.
