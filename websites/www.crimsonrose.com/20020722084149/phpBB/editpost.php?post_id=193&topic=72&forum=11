     <TD BGCOLOR="#2E4460"><TEXTAREA NAME="message" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">...AGAIN! Yet AGAIN...I go out of my way and don't say a WORD to your friggin' members...yet they send me tells with smart ass remarks trying to "goat" me into a confrontation. When will you realize what you not doing is ruining something that you are wanting to keep good.

These bad apples are ruining something that you are wanting to keep "pure", for lack of a better word. If they do this to me, someone they don't like, what says they won't do this to others they don't like. Not everyone comes forward to a guild leader to inform what is going on.

Remember Scott...and I quote..."If a friend lies for you, he will lie against you." Maybe its finally time to re-evalute who your friends are.

I am in the midst of uploading all the screens onto a page with an explanation of what transpired under each screenshot. Take it as you want...but more screenshots will be provided when they transpire! You Scott, are a good person. But you are being fooled if you believe what you wanted to see happen and accomplish with your guild is really being what you intended it to be. Even the best laid plans go arye(sp)!

There will be an edit message under this post and the ONLY thing editted will be an address where you can go to see all these pics.

EDITTED<----<b>THE PICS ARE UPLOADING ALL SCREWY! IF YOU WANT THEM SCOTT, EMAIL ME A ADDRESS THAT IS GOOD AND I WILL SEND YOU EACH OF THEM. They can be read perfectly that way. I will summerize them here though...</b>

To set the stage a little though...I wear DW Helm, Arms, Bracers x2, Gauntlets and boots with Mithril BP and Legs. I have not grouped with or talked to or retaliated towards <b>ANYONE</b> from Untamed Dreamers about the events NOW long ago. Yet these punks keep it going.

Cedarspirit's /tell to me after seeing me (Dantrag) at the bank in Firona Fie this morning (after he gave me a sow).: "Looks like you spent the profits from Silmarius's gear quite well!!! Congradulations!"

After which I did not nor ever did responded to this remark. Then...Not long afterwards (roughly 5 minutes) I get a /tell from Tharak (mind you, I have not spoken to nor even seen him since he flamed me and left the guild with his idol (puppetmaster) Cedarspirit, which I might add, these 2 talk consistantly on a voice chat. Go figure...

Tharak's /tell to me: "Are you still interested in DW Gauntlets?"

Again...I did not nor ever did repsond to this remark to try to get me, yet again into pissing contest with them.

Does it stop there? Nope. Tharak then messages me back in about 15 minutes with this...

Tharak's /tell to me: Sorry, didn't realize you already had dw gaunts, you may now return to your regularly scheduled program.

In the midst of him telling me this, he was in no zone that I was in, nor did I meet with him during this time, so he could not have possibly seen what I was wearing to know to answer the way that he did.

On a side note, Scott, that incident I told you about Cedarspirit coming directly to me and hacking on me and remember me telling you that I tried to scroll up and get a screenshot and that I couldn't, but I was wrong.  I do have that screenshot.

Now I figure there will be excuses this time for what you will see what you see that will validate why they did what they did, so I'm not expecting anything to be done...again.

So if you want the pics, send me an email and I will send them to you; I have all four. <--- End of Edit

Edit #2 <--- Any member wanting these pics as well for validation, I am prepared to send them to you as well.
