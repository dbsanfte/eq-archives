Despite his wounds and overwhelming odds, Kirel did a most noble act.  He used his Diety given powers to heal mine own wounds instead o' his own.  The bandits, seeing that I would overcome them quickly at that point, turned in fury upon Kirel Redhand and soon cut him down.  In a blind rage, I made short work of the remaining three but it was already too late.

I do not subscribe to this belief in a higher power being but a simple warrior of a fridged land.  But now I wonder, having seen such a wonder!  Truely, Kirel is blessed and his heart most pure among us all!<p>: Carrai En Ellisande most noble Kirel Redhand!
