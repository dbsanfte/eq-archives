"MAYHEM!!!" The thunderous voice shook the very earth itself, "WHERE ARE YOU, YOU MAGGOT!"<BR><BR>

"H.. h... here m'lord" Mayhem said stepping out of the shadows onto the red marble floor.<BR><BR>

The room was filled with spectators as Mayhem stood in the middle of the throne room, all eyes upon him. As he went down to his knees he began looking about at his fellow brothers. The deamons looked back with joy in their eyes as they knew Mayhem had upset their lord, The Lord of Terror, Diablo.<BR><BR>

A chill of fear shot from the back of Mayhem's neck down to his feet as he heard the sound of hoof beats on the stone approaching him.<BR><BR>

"You trouble me child..." Diablo spoke, looking down on Mayhems kneeling figure "Why does the Council of Lords still live?"<BR><BR>

The Lord of Terror stood nearly twice as tall as a man and the smell of brimstone was enough to choke an unprepared soul. His hardened red shell of a body emitted waves of heat that began to overtake Mayhems senses.<BR><BR>

"SPEAK!" Diablo shouted causing Mayhem to jolt and small rocks from the ceiling to fall to the floor.<BR><BR>

Many of the lesser deamons ran for cover from their Lords wrath, while others watched in almost blissful anticipation. Mayhem then looked up at his master.<BR><BR>

"M... M.. Mandrake is no more, the castle lies in ruins and the living members have been scattered to the winds" He stammered, "What more could you possibly want?"<BR><BR>

"WHAT DO I WANT?!?" The Lord of Terror screamed.<BR><BR>

Diablo then grabbed Mayhem by his cloak and held him high into the air dangling him in front of his face.<BR><BR>

"... Their souls..." Diablo said slowly, "They have challenged my power now every last one of them shall die a thousand deaths by my hand."<BR><BR>

Mayhem grabbed for his neck, choked by his own cloak as he swung helpless in front of the Lord of Terror.<BR><BR>

"You fail me one more time..." Diablo then looked through Mayhem's eyes straight into his soul, "and I shall make you dine on your own entrails."<BR><BR>

With that Diablo threw Mayhem into the watching group of deamons. Like a ragged doll he flew through the air and landed in a heap crushing many of the minions.<BR><BR>

"Crush them, I don't care how many of us it takes. Just be sure they won't be able to stop you next time, for your sake." Diablo stated heading back into his chambers.<BR><BR>

The crowds of deamons and murderers began to take there leave, magical gates began to open throughout the room. All but one man, who watched Mayhem in silence. The shrouded man eyed Mayhem as he talked to himself, taking careful note of what he said...<BR><BR>

"Crush them?" Mayhem said to himself, "That would take a massive army, larger then the last. Only the Kriegers have a force that..."<BR><BR>

A wicked smile came over Mayhem's face at that moment, as the revelation hit him.<BR><BR>

"Yes the Kriegers will do nicely..." Mayhem said as he tossed his black cloak over his shoulders and faded into the shadows.<BR><BR>

The shrouded figure watched in amusement as one of Diablo's warriors known as Mayhem was about to fall into a bloody mess that would for sure go over his head.<BR><BR>

"Perhaps this information could be useful," Kane said to himself, "Most useful indeed..." With that Kane rubbed the ruby amulet around his neck, magically took on the guise of a deamon and slowly began making his way back to the surface world.<BR><BR>

~<BR><BR>

"Gerin behind you!" Lady Battlehawk shouted seeing a group of skeletons come behind the young warrior.<BR><BR>

"Thank you m'lady, I'll handle them," Gerin pulled his mace from his leather belt and approached the flimsy skeletons "Die you foul creatures!"<BR><BR>

Gerin engaged the whole troop of undead down the dark corridor. Bones could be heard scattering down the hallway as he drove his mace into the horde. Lady Battlehawk watched with a smile, knowing full well that even this inexperienced warrior could handle these foes, for she was around in case any of Diablo's Warriors showed tonight.<BR><BR>

"Glory to House Krieger! They were too easy!" Gerin shouted down to Lady Battlehawk "I could take on King Leoric himself!"<BR><BR>

"Bravo young warrior, bravo!" Lady Battlehawk applauded, "In time friend in time."<BR><BR>

The clapping carried down the ancient hallway into the blackness. As the echo ended the sound of steel being drawn from a scabbard rang back down towards them.<BR><BR>

"What was that?" Gerin said nervously.<BR><BR>

"Hold Gerin, I'll investigate" Lady Battlehawk stated as she peered down the web infested hallway.<BR><BR>

"But.." The young warrior didn't like the idea of a Lady defending him.<BR><BR>

"Shut your trap boy, it could be one of Diablo's" Lady Battlehawk had no time to put up with this child, a glint of sweat shined on her forehead. "If I tell you to run, you best do that and don't even look back."<BR><BR>

"Aye m'lady" Gerin stated respecting her authority.<BR><BR>

"Step back into the shadows now, I'll be back" She said moving towards the sound.<BR><BR>

Gerin crouched down behind a decaying shrine watching Lady Battlehawk disappear into the darkness. His sense of safety shattered before his eyes as his he saw his own reflection staring back at him from the blade of a bloody sword.<BR><BR>

"She fell for that all to easily" the menacing voice that was holding the sword to Gerin's face stated, "Now you will pay with your soul..."<BR><BR>

Gerin could see his frightened red-tinted image screaming back at himself in horror as the sword lifted for it's killing blow.<BR><BR>

"ARHhhh..." The bloody moans carried down the corridors.<BR><BR>

"GERIN!?!" Lady Battlehawk quickly spun around, "GERIN!!!"<BR><BR>

Lady Battlehawk had realized her mistake and came back running to the shrine where she had left her new warrior. She skidded to a halt at the bloody site. Gerin lay with his face in the shrine's red colored pool, his throat slit.<BR><BR>

"Oh Gerin... What have I done." Lady Battlehawk fell to his side.<BR><BR>

"You betrayed him, as I will now betray you..." A figure stepped out of the shadows, seemingly out of no where.<BR><BR>

"Dantrag?!? What are you doing here?" Lady Battlehawk stepped back confused, "Did you kill Gerin? What of our alliance?"<BR><BR>

"The Crimson Rose cares nothing of this alliance and only wishes to see Castle Krieger burn to the ground." Dantrag stated.<BR><BR>

"You fool have you gone mad!" Battlehawk cried drawing her blade.<BR><BR>

"Aye, I guess I have..." Dantrag stated quickly throwing his cape over his shoulders and fading into the very shadows themselves.
