<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" face="sans-serif">HAIL an'Well Met Traveler!<BR><BR>I presume you are here because you are either interested in, or have already joined our guild. You wil be, or already am, a part of a guild that has been around for over 7 years now. We started in the beta of Diablo and then moved to the beta of Ultima Online. After playing UO for a time, we found others games like Tanarus, Warcraft, Starcraft and a host of others. We are presently playing EverQuest and have plans of moving to other games when we have interest in them or get bored of the game we are presently playing. <BR><BR>I feel it necessary to put here in "writing", so you understand how we operate. We are a guild of friends. We are close unit and only allow a certain type of person join us in the gaming worlds with which we play in. A lot of us know each other on a first name basis and call each other on a regular basis. We talk with each other in-game with the use of Microsoft's Sidewinder Game Voice. This is NOT a necessary item for you to have to be a part of our family. We are not interested in the type character you play. The character you play does not, in most cases, represent the person.<BR><BR>The type of person we want and are looking for is the type of person that is giving, self-sacrificing, generous, open-minded and can follow rules set forth in the guilds charter which is located in this same forum under <b>"The Guild Charter"</b>.<BR><BR>We are a guild that focus's on friendship with each other rather then "power-leveling" or "power-gaming" like most guilds are set up for. We, at times, will get together and go some place in game as a group, but most times, we talk in guild chat and level our characters as we see fit.<BR><BR>We help each other unconditionally! When we sell items to guild members, it IS mandatory to sell the item at half the market price before you try to sell it on the open markets. The reason for this is to ensure that your family gets good items and can become more powerful in time with the help of a family. In most cases, like myself, I usually just give items to members and not charge them. However, speaking of my self only, if I am in need of coin, I will sell the item to a member of my family for 90% off the market price. Although this is NOT the guilds norm, it IS what and how I prefer to handle my items to the guild. I encourage you to do something similar but understand that it is NOT mandatory to.<BR><BR>We are posting this for two reasons. The first being to inform you how and what we are about. The second is a bit more in-depth.<BR><BR>We have had a problem with people coming into the guild, playing with us for a month or two, leveling, then leaving us for another guild that either "power-levels" or "power-games". We are NOT a greedy guild. We really don't care if we get the "uber" items in the game. But, if you level faster then others in the guild, rest assured that most of the lower levels in the guild have alts/primary characters to accompany you where you would want to go. <BR><BR>We are telling you this because we feel like a rest stop for those that do not have the heart to maintain membership and help the guild become an "upper-level" guild. Becoming an "upper-level" guild does not mean that we are wanting to become "uber" and go after "uber" items. It DOES mean that we wold like to have 10 to 15 members in the 50's. <BR><BR>With all the upper level members that have left...we could have had that by now. But those that left did not have the heart to stay and enjoy the company of real friends and grow with the others here.<BR><BR>So, in short, if you feel that you, after leveling and becoming an "upper-level" character, that you can not maintain membership with us and want to go to a "power" guild, we ask that you reconsider your potential membership with us. If you are already a member and joined recently, and you as well feel that you can not maintain membership with the guild, we ask that you kindly remove your tag in game and no hard feelings will be had.<BR><BR>We ask for people to join us that are wanting to have a LONG lasting membership with friends that care about you and that will be there for you when needed. We are not looking for "power-gamers", k3VVL d00dz and/or just plain knuckle-headed people. We are all adults and maintain a gaming atmosphere conducive to the genre we are in.<BR><BR>If you have ANY question, please contact any of the Officers of the guild and they can help you with ANYTHING you may need.<BR><BR>We thank you for your consideration of The Crimson Rose/Order of Rathmar and hope that you find the type of membership within a guild that you are looking for.<BR><BR>Be well and safe in all things...<BR><BR>Dantrag Battlemountain,<BR>Guildmaster,<BR>The Crimson Rose/Order of Rathmar,<BR><!-- BBCode auto-link start --><a href="http://www.crimsonrose.com" target="_blank">www.crimsonrose.com</a><!-- BBCode auto-link end --><BR>
