Welcome to the Crimson Rose Gaming Guild. Do to us moving from the Karana Server in Everquest, to the Ayonae Ro Server, we were unable to get our old name of "The Crimson Rose". In so doing, we changed our name to "Order of Rathmar" for that server/game only. We have been, and always shall be, The Crimson Rose. We have been together, as a guild, for over 7 years now. Since the arrival of more online games, we decided to move into them all. If there is a game that you would like to see linked, contact Dantrag or Ares and give 48 hours for it to be posted for you.<br><br><hr>

<B><FONT COLOR="#6699CC" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">World of Warcraft!!</font></b><font color="$6699CC" size="2" face="arial"> - <a href="mailto:dantrag@crimsonrose.com">Dantrag</a> @ 11:03 am on 3/31/02</font><br><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">This was posted from a games day preview of this game!! Go to the link to the left and visit their site! The screenshots are WoW!<p>--->In the land of Bordeaux, brie and croissants, Vivendi Universal Games, the Games Division of Vivendi Universal Publishing, unveiled what has got to be one of the most anticipated games ever, Blizzard's World of Warcraft. Shown today at an international press event with journalists from around the globe, GameSpy was on hand to partake in this event.<p>We've been working on this for two years now," explains Shane Dabiri, producer on World of Warcraft, "and we're really excited about it. We've created something that anyone can pick up and play. The Warcraft name speaks for itself and we think you'll be pleased on what you see here today." Set up on three PCs, Dabiri and Associate Producer Carlos Guerrero started up a demo that kept us mesmerized and awestruck for the next hour.<p>For those of you unfamiliar, World of Warcraft is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG for short). Much like EverQuest and Asheron's Call, thousands and thousands of gamers will be able to play simultaneously in this wondrous world filled with epic battles, valiant quests, and brave heroes. <p>The storyline of World of Warcraft takes place four years after Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Players are thrust into the battle torn land of Azeroth, where races slowly begin to rebuild their shattered lands after massive wars that could have destroyed them all. But when new threats, both from the past and present, arise and begin to takeover the world once again, it's up to you to band together with fellow warriors and bring peace to the lands of Azeroth.<p>"Unlike other similar games like this," explains Dabiri, "we wanted to steer away from the realism of it all. We wanted World of Warcraft to have a storybook look and feel to it. So while you're exploring Azeroth and its neighboring lands, you'll notice that it's more colorful and vibrant. You can even go as to say its more cartoon like. Our heroes have epic proportions -- they're overstated."<p>As he was explaining this, we watched as his human character moved about in a beautiful world, filled with lush vegetation, beautiful landscapes and expanses of land that seemed to go on for mile and miles. "Our terrain is streaming," continues Dabiri, "which means it's continuous terrain, there is no loading whatsoever during gameplay. There will be times when you're on one end of the map and you have to get to the other side. Players will have access to horses and carriages, but in addition, players can teleport using scrolls such as this."<p>By the click of a mouse, Dabiri was able to transport himself from one side of the map in an instant. "Granted you have to earn these in the game, but for the purposes of this demo, I've given myself a couple extra. There will also be devices where you can activate and that will act like a waypoint. So if you die in battle, it will bring you back to that point."

<B><FONT COLOR="#6699CC" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">Caster Updates</font></b><font color="$6699CC" size="2" face="arial"> - <a href="mailto:mriley1058@mediaone.net">Sabani</a> @ 8:59 pm on 3/18/02</font><br><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="2" FACE="arial">AND IT WAS CONFIRMED, MARCH 15, 2002 <br>As promised, we would like to explain in more detail some of the changes that you'll be seeing in EverQuest.<p>Some of these changes are already available on the Test Server and will be arriving on Live servers just in time for EverQuest's third anniversary. Others you may expect to find on Test in the coming weeks, which we hope to make available to everyone soon afterward.<p>For those new to EverQuest, as well as our mid-level players:<p>The need to sit down and stare at the spellbook to regain mana has been removed at all levels. (Sitting down and having Meditation skill are still required.)<br>  <br>When starting a new character for the first time, it can take quite some time to get into that class' core abilities. In some cases, the style of gameplay needs to shift dramatically. That being the case, we've accelerated the rate at which people gain experience up to level ten.<br>  <br>In addition, undue frustration can occur during these youthful times. Traumatic events such as losing a corpse and not knowing where to find it or how to retrieve it can be quite the ordeal. With that in mind, we've changed the way that death works below level ten. Characters level nine and under who die will appear at their bind point with all of their equipment intact. (A short-lived corpse will still be left at the site of the disaster to allow the player to receive a resurrection.)<br>  <br>Experience gained in dungeons designed for players level 30 and under will be increased. For many people, there is nothing more satisfying in EverQuest than adventuring in dungeons. By giving people the tools to help them succeed earlier, and rewards to match, we hope that more players will discover why many people feel this way.<br>  <br>In the spirit of getting characters into more dangerous and rewarding situations, earlier, the following spell lines have been altered to make them easier to use and more widely available, across more level ranges.<br>- Resurrection, for Clerics and Paladins.<br>- Summon Corpse, for Necromancers and Shadowknights.<br>- Succor/Evacuate, for Druids and Wizards <br>The bind points of starting characters will more closely match the areas they are already familiar with. (No more getting lost as new characters die in town, only to show up someplace outside.)<br>  <br>New characters now start with considerably more food and drink.<br>  <br>After applying advanced mathemagics, the commonly known "hell-level" experience gain effect in levels 30, 35, 40, and 45 has been largely done away with. Further, the "post-hell-level" experience loss in levels 31, 36, 41, and 46 was driven from the face of Norrath as well. <br>For all EverQuest players:<p>Rumors abound that Bristlebane, God of Mischief, for reasons of his own design, has infused the Gnome and Halfling races with new potential professions. (Whether this is a blessing or a curse has yet to be decided.)<br>  <br>The long-requested global chat channels are well on their way. We'll be supporting player-created chat channels for raids, for friends, for total strangers - Anything you'd like to use them for. Expect a documentation update (eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest directory) explaining how to use these soon.<br>  <br>We've cleaned up what happens while you're zoning. The days of a frozen screen full of blurry text may well be over, forever. (The days of losing /tells, /guild chat, and group messages while zoning will hopefully be heading out the door behind them.)<br>  <br>While we have aimed to support armor/skin layer tinting on the majority of video cards, some of the abandoned video cards that are still used to play EverQuest unfortunately do not have the power to handle this feature. With that in mind, we will soon be implementing a switch that will allow players to enable armor/skin tinting at their discretion. (Stay tuned to a patch message, coming soon.) <br>The last item we'd like to mention is a brief update on caster and priest rebalancing. (Please note that the balancing act is still going on, across the board. We wanted to update you on the progress we've made so far.)<p>Expect to see the first of the Focus Items for spell casters and spell-casting hybrids soon. We will leave the specifics to you to discover, but rest assured that useful and exciting focus items are making their way into the game as we speak.<br>  <br>Enchanters' Memory Blur line, and aspects of Rapture and Glamour of Kintaz have been improved.<br>  <br>The grouping requirement for the Translocate series of spells has been removed.<br>  <br>Clerics' Smite line has been improved.<br>  <br>The Post-50 Lich line for Necromancers has been redistributed.<br>  <br>Necromancers' Levant and Skin of the Shadow have been changed to allow them to be used any time of the day.<br>  <br>Necromancers' Quivering Veil of Xarn has been improved. <br>Many of the caster balance changes to date have been made with feedback from the dedicated players of these classes, both from E-Mails and message boards. We're grateful for the time and effort that has been put into many well-reasoned comments we've received.<p>Thank you for helping us make our world, yours.<p>- The EverQuest Team<br> <br>

The young mystic behind him nervously fingered the cudgel hanging from his belt. He knew what was coming. The hold of the faceless had firmly taken hold of his heart and was beginning to squeeze.<br>Vek turned to him quietly and simply said, "Find them." He then walked silently out of the room.<br>Hierophant Zand turned to the young Mystic, "Do as he has asked. Do not return until you have the skulls of the ancients in your possession." The young Mystic stumbled as he ran out of the room, visibly shaking.<br>Zand looked down into the empty skull case. Something glittered softly in the corner of the case. Zand reached in and picked up a small earring, emblazoned with the symbol of the Kunzar.<br>Zand walked quietly out of the room, and somewhere the soul of a dead emperor laughed with unholy malice.<p><b>** Another Tale **</b><p>Halor slashed frantically at the creature before him. He swung down hard, cleaving the great worm in two. Unfortunately there were many more were that came from. Bauric climbed over a rock and stood next to Halor, fighting off another of the worms.<br>Halor suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right heel and spun violently around, causing his journals to fly out of his pack and onto the hard stone floor. He swung at the worm larva with his sword knocking it away, but too late. The worm had wounded him badly, he could no longer hold himself up on the wounded ankle and he fell to the floor with a crash. Bauric cried out in pain as one of the larger worms bit into his arm. That was the last thing Halor saw before the horde of worms squirmed across the stones and overcame them.<p>- The EverQuest Team
