: Hail friends, i must leave the Rose.
: The character of Rredre has become almost completely unplayable as I've learned that his faction with his guild in Felwithe is badly tarnished now too.  I didn't have the benefit of knowing what to expect in this game like many of you beta testers did and we all know how useless the manual and .txt files are for the game.
: The good thing (for my game playing anyway) is that the evil Necromancer i've toyed around with once in a while to learn that area has become quite an enjoyable character and in fact will be a founder and High Council member of a new guild, the Dark Elements not tagged yet but the members are restless for it.

: The bad news is that after i found out the faction problem i got so upset that i just deleted the character. Stupid move i could have given the gear away at least to guild members or other Paladin's even.
: He was broke with very little cash but had ok gear, Oh well it was mostly ringmail which is pretty heavy anyway except for the banded helm that Lyanth made for
: him.

: Thanks for letting me join and give it a try. I've enjoyed playing alongside you, I'm not totally in agreement with how the Rose is run all the hoops and 
: being watched for 2 weeks etc...makes a newbie feel odd
: and not part of the crowd but i've enjoyed adventureing with those I have tho greatly and I'm glad i was able to recruit new members like Infestus!
: 'Festy and Rredre killed gobbies together since the second week of games release i think! 

: If you run into a 9th Year Necromancer Tier'dal named &quot;Rrendarly&quot; you guessed it that's me, Rr is something i use in all games to id me, in Rainbow Six on MPlayer I'm known as RRepster quite possibly the best squad leader in Co-Op play if i dare boast that at least the people that always immediately flock to my server say so anyway. Don't worry PC's are not enemies to Rrendarly unless there's a good RP reason (like your Kanluk quest for example). It amazes me the people that don't RP correctly and instead throw insults at DE's but when questioned why they do that to a DE and not the snobby High Elf or the mostly godless Gnome's they say &quot;i dont know&quot;. However he does not like people boasting about killing the Dragoon guards as the woods there are the toughest newbie zone in the game and with the guards always chasing invadeing PC's you can guess how often newbie players die there...all I can say is any DE that lives to 10th lvl without giveing up deserves a salute believe me they took at least 3x as long to make it there than any other race.
: BTW there are ways around the guards there without fighting...it amazes me the lack of thinking these barbarians have always thinking they have to charge right thru...wild horses won't drag it out of me tho it would be a spoiler so don't ask me....besides I havn't met a decent PC zone in their yet that wasn't rude or RP'ing right...so I don't tell them either...

: Take care Crimson Rose!!! Keep the faith and keep on setting the RP example in your thoughts, your words and in your honorable and noble deeds!!!!

: In Character:
: Rredre Talviac approaches Lord Tynkale in Felwithe, &quot;Have yee returned with the pelt from the Jujungua yet!!&quot; &quot;No my Lord, I was detained.&quot; &quot;Detained? Detained!!! I have had enough of you I have heard of your actions involving yourself with the human's war in Freeport! Yee are not a Defender!! And the blood of the wolves puma's and bees you have slain cry out to Tunare!!&quot; &quot;But my Lord they attacked me, what was i supposed to do let the beasts eat me or my party members?&quot; &quot;That Rredre is one of the decisions you chose to make throughout your career you made the wrong decisions!! Lord Jyleel remove this Elf far from my prescence! Banish him and let him be trained no more!!&quot; &quot;But but my Lord, explain to me how a Knight of the rank of 10 was able to best the Tier'dal in Crushbone if I have not honor and if Tunare wasn't with me!! Explain to me how I could have had such an effect in helping the dwarves turn the war in their favor against the goblin armies if I have not had honor and Tunare's blessing upon me?? Answer me I demand!&quot;
: --Silence not a word is answered to his question. The blade from Lord Jyleel cuts swiftly thru him, Rredre almost didn't feel it it was so sharp, like a hot knife thru butter. 
: &quot;That was a mistake m'lord&quot; he says while he falls to the ground, &quot;the name I bear -- Talviac, is not a last name...&quot; tis the name of a randomly born adventurer only one Talviac can exist at a time, each new one is different and opposite of the other....I'm afraid to say that Norrath may not be same now...for the next one will be quite different.....&quot; breathes his last....
: --------
: &quot;Does the boy have it takes&quot; the Tier'dal master Necromancer says before the council, &quot;Noxhil he has what it takes and then some, he's a Talviac,&quot; Kizdean Gix says impatiently. &quot;Look in his eyes, the determination the fire in them, this boy must be trained, or else he'll be a rebel, with undisciplined magic for the magic is strong in him determined I sense.&quot;

: &quot;Fine then,&quot; Noxhil responds, &quot;We shall train him in the House of the Dead, he will be assigned to the Dark Elements sub guild.&quot; 

: &quot;Thank you my Lord,&quot; Rrendarly Talviac says with a bow,
: &quot;I shall obey honor and do the Queen's bidding,&quot; 

: &quot;That you will Rrendarly, but I sense there is more in your mission in the future, for you are a Talviac I believe.&quot;

: --&quot;Ah I feel much better!!!&quot; Rrendarly says upon life tapping a giant fire beetle, yet for some reason in his mind he sees not a fire beetle but a wretched High Elf Knight as his victim...
