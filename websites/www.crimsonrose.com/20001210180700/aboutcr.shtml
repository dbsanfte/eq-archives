	<b>What is the Crimson Rose?</b><BR>
	The Crimson Rose is an online role-playing guild for graphical
    MUD games based in fantasy settings. The guild was established
    during the glory days of &quot;<A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo"
    TARGET="_blank">Diablo (beta)</A>&quot; and moved onto the lands of
    Britannia for &quot;<A HREF="http://www.owo.com/" TARGET="_blank">Ultima
    Online (beta)</A>&quot;. Currently the guild is involved in Verant Interactive's &quot;<A HREF="http://www.everquest.com/"
    TARGET="_blank">Everquest</A>&quot;, a massive multi-player fantasy
    online game based in the lands of Norrath. The guild is designed
    as a kingdom ruled by our King and Queen and the Barons of their
    surrounding lands. Focused mainly on the Role-Playing of good
    character types the guild is helpful to all players in the actual
    game that are not evil/rude. The Crimson Rose is &quot;Anti-Player
    Killing&quot; for purpose of killing for loot, though player
    killers are permitted into the guild for defensive purposes only
    but have their actions closely monitored as to keep the Crimson
    Rose's good name. Member or not, the Crimson Rose looks forward
    to meeting all role-players in game and sharing good times during
    our online gaming experience. We are currently exploring other games to become a multi-game guild and to expand our time online to more then one game theme. We encourage you to come join us in this endeavor and explore the worlds we reside in to the fullest of your imagination.<BR><BR>United by Friendship, 
	Guided by Truth... Sworn to Justice.<BR><BR>
	
	<b>I want to become a member!</b><BR>
	Good to hear! The Crimson Rose it always looking for valuable members to add to our guild. We do recommend that you read and understand the Rules and Laws of the guild before you submit your application to us. Once you have read our guidelines just fully complete the form on the Guild Application page and wait for a response. You should receive a statement back from our recruiting office no later then 72 hours after sending it in.<BR><BR>
	
	<b>Do you allow Evil Races?</b><BR>
	Yes, only as long as the character "role-plays" him/her as a good-aligned person. Just because a race has a bad reputation does not mean all members are the same. But we are a group of role players and you may have to "win" the respect of other members in the guild, most likely these will lead up to some excellent roleplaying encounters as well. Elves and Dark Elves just have a hard time getting along...<BR><BR>

	<b>Do you allow Evil Classes?</b><BR>
	No, Shadow Knight and Necromancers are not permitted to be members of our kingdom due to their evil and demonic nature. And guild members will not treat such characters on the best of terms. These two classes stand for everything that our guild is against and are not to be seen within our Kingdom.<BR><BR>

	<b>What is the benefit of joining?</b><BR>
	Fun! We are a group of good friends who play for the enjoyment of the game. Protection is also a major factor as well, nothing gives you more pride then saving a member in distress and relieving his gratitude as reward. We look out for our own and make sure that all members are having a great time!
