<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">: OOC: This summer has been very busy for me as most of you that i adventure with frequently have noticed but i did begin to get time back in eq, where i chose not to regain my strength to adventure with my normal parties but to gather myself new equipment and supplies which i spent the last few weeks doing although a terrible turn of events posted earlier tells the tale of what happened to me where i lost all my items. This has made it very difficult to play seeing as how i have nothing of which i spent getting since day 1 of eq. Although this isnt so bad i can always get them back with the help of  you all but that takes time of which i wont have much of anymore, since school is starting and sports. I am sure you all know what im talking about.<p>: <br>: But school isnt starting for about 2 weeks so in that time if anyone wants to get a party together to adventure with me, just post a message here, email me or icq me. Otherwise i just dont have the heart to play as of right now. <p>: So hopefully i will in the future again be able to see you all frequently in the lands of norrath until then i wish you all the best of luck<p>: <br>: Kaltar Khadak <br>: Friend, member, and Champion of the Rose.<p>: PS. A new game still in beta Asherions Call is out and if anyone is playing that please give me a tell by email for you can find me there alot of the time these days.<p>What equipment do ya need kaltar?</FONT>
