: After witnessing this past meeting, I have come to realize that we, as a guild, should join the same IRC server for our weekly meetings, to avoid the aggravated lag many members on the Toronto server experienced.  

: Indeed, it confused many folks during the actual meeting, for many thought that people were speaking directly on top of the King and leaders while THEY were trying to speak, while the truth is that we all were seeing their text in a much-delayed manner because of the lag.

: Being on the same IRC server will bring this to a minimum.

: I have taken many notes and have observered the behavior of the IRC network we use over many RL ages, 
: and I feel that the first, best server to connect with is the San Francisco one.  It is at the top of the server tree on Chatnet.  SF.CA.US.Chatnet.Org is the proper addy, and I have found that the higher ports are more efficient than the lower ones.  E.G., SF.CA.US.Chatnet.Org:7003.

: The second and only choice is Portland, only because that be where K9 resides.  This is not so critical when the channel is keyed, such as ours is.  But because it IS the thrust of Chatnet, that server-set is more stable than most of the lower ones in the tree.

: Portland.OR.US.Chatnet.Org be the addy.  I suggest lower ports for that one, like 6662.  

: So for the next meeting this Sunday, let us all join the San Fran. server.  It should bring lag-splits between members down to a minimum during the meeting, and prevent the nasty 16 minute delays between members that Rogan and I witnessed after all was said and done.
