rules are to be adhered to by every member of the Champions of Norrath. Any indiscretion
of said rules would be grounds for tribunal by the senior members of council. An
inquisition would be held, and a decision with or without punishment will be rendered. </span></font></p>

Combat</span></font></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Upon
    entering a known creature spawn location, any existing &quot;campers&quot; or
    &quot;campers&quot; that arrive will be asked about rotating &quot;kills&quot;. This is
    done to prevent &quot;kill stealing&quot;.</span></font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">When
    engaging an NPC currently in combat with another player, you may not loot the corpse until
    the combat is over and you have been granted permission by the player who originally
    engaged the NPC. This is to prevent the appearance of &quot;kill stealing&quot;, as game
    delays will often give false information as to the status of the combat leading to
    accidental competition for the same NPC, or leading you to believe you are saving someone
    who is not actually in danger </span></font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">If
    there is a dispute with non-members about a kill, screen capture the text. Handle the
    situation in a calm, honorable manner. No matter what language they use, keep yours clean.</span></font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">If a
    situation seems unsolvable, do a &quot;/who champions all&quot; to see what officers are
    online. Notify them immediately and let them take over the situation.</span></font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">NO
    RETALIATION will be tolerated! If you stoop to that level, you are stooping below the
    ideals that the Champions of Norrath hold.</span></font></li>

    courteous to your fellow guildmates in your party. Do not go out and pull MOBs without
    asking the others in your group. Spellcasters need time to regenerate mana. Obvious
    careless acts that cause other guild members harm will not be tolerated.</span></font></li>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I. The Planes</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When a member of CoN is in the planes (Fear, Hate, Sky,
  etc.), he/she should be aware of the looting rules so conduct will not become an issue</font></p>
</blockquote>

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Guild Event<br>
    </font></li>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A loot table has been created with all planable
  members.&nbsp; This will track who has what and works on a rotating basis. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Special items such as God drops etc are also on a
  separate table and will be dealt with accordingly.</font></p>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a guest</font></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When any member of CoN is a guest of another group or
  guild that is in the planes, it is imperative that discussions of loot outside of basic
  inquiry (&quot;what is a X?&quot; etc) be kept to a minimum. Loot will be distributed by
  the inviting guild as they see fit. The invite should be used as a learning experience or
  for fun&#133;nothing more.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">II. Loot in regular groups</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If there is a group consisting solely of CoN members,
  then loot will be distributed on a &quot;need first&quot; basis. If there are more than 1
  persons that need the item, then those persons can determine there and then if they wish
  to roll, or to let one take the item with the understanding that the other will have
  priority over the next person on next drop.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If no member of the party has a direct need of the item,
  it can be distributed either by agreement or /random amongst all party members. It is
  recommended that loot be distributed to guild members in need of said item before it is
  auctioned or traded but this is by no means required. It is understood that members may
  occasionally want to trade or sell items for their personal benefit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In mixed groups on a non CoN function (by which it&#146;s
  understood that non CoN functions are random pick up groups), items will be dealt with by
  the group leader. If the group leader is a CoN, then the best course of action would be to
  have any &quot;need&quot; items rolled upon by any group members that can use.</font></p>

    hard to concentrate on adventuring when endless text is scrolling by. Keep the
    conversations meaningful. They can be about RL or RPG life.</span></font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="mso-list: skip" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Please use the officers! They are there to
    handle minor problems and discretions. Keep /tell's to the GM at a minimum. /Tell's are
    for conversation meant <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not to be </i>heard by
    others. If it isn't that important, then /guildsay is fine.</span></font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="mso-list: skip" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">If you are being barraged by non guild

    will be brought to the attention of an officer of Champions of Norrath <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">IMMEDIATELY</i>. Screen shots are recommended, since

    on.</span></font></p>

    that will handle the situation if it is on their shift, to prevent multiple inquiries.</span></font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">After a

  <li><p style="mso-list: skip"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Members that go above and beyond the call of

    may nominate members of the guild, and may also nominate Non-members, for acts deemed
    worthy of recognition. Non members will be officially recognized by the guild master.
    (example: non member grouped with members risks his life to save our members in a combat
    situation. This is Champion of Norrath behavior, and recognizing the individual may also
    become a good recruiting tool)</span></font></p>

    Membership forum. An explanation of the deguilding is not required, however the interest
    to return must be posted.</font></p>

  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Officers review the reasons the ex-member deguilded, the
    reputation the ex-member had with the guild and decide if the ex-member's reapplication
    will be accepted. A majority vote of the officers is required for the reapplication
    process to continue.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If reapplication is denied, the ex-member will be informed by

    the ex-member. At least two officers will be present to log the discussion and review any
    concerns of the ex-member and the officers. Any expectations or requirements on both sides
    will be reviewed. </font></p>

  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The ex-member will be out of the Champions for approximately one
    month before taking the tag again. This time is suggested to allow the ex-member to truly
    resolve the problems that caused the initial deguilding and to make it clear that
    deguilding is a serious thing and should not be done without serious consideration.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">During this time they are allowed to participate in guild groups

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">NOTE: During these crucial steps in the re-application process, it
would be prudent if the petitioning ex-member did not press the officers or push for
constants updates, as these discussions take time and are of a sensitive nature.
Continuing to do so will reflect negatively on possible return.</font>

<ul>
  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Active members of the guild may express their opinions of the
    ex-member by telling an officer or emailing an officer. Please do NOT post these opinions
    on any forums. If the guild as a whole seems to favor or reject an ex-member's
    reapplication, the officers will take this into consideration.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Prior to the next guild meeting, officers will review the
    ex-member's behavior during the separation period, the officer meeting log, any new
    concerns in addition to the ex-member's actions. If the ex-member has not been very active
    in game during this period, more time may be required to make a determination. Absence is
    not a positive thing in this situation. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Officers then take a FINAL vote on whether to offer the temp tag
    back to this ex-member. ALL officers must agree to accept this person back or review what
    other requirements are needed. This is the most crucial step and requires a unanimous
    vote. Otherwise the ex-member will only cause more stress by coming back.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If approved, the ex-member will be given a temp tag at the next
    guild meeting. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the next month, that member is on probation and may be
    deguilded if any problems or concerns arise, just as a normal New member. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If the temp period completes successfully, the member then becomes
    a Permanent member again at the next guild meeting and when in the planes, goes to the
    bottom of the class loot list, just as any other New member.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: .25in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Deguilding a SECOND time will mean permanent banishment from the
guild. No review, no reconsideration. The only exception to this will be IF the member
discussed the reasons for leaving and the intention to return at a later date with Karas.
If no prior approval was granted BEFORE the member deguilds a second time, there will be
no returning to the guild at a later date.<br>
<br>
We encourage our members to discuss problems and concerns BEFORE they become something so
upsetting that deguilding seems to be the only solution.<br>
<br>
Please talk to the officers prior to issuing the guild remove command. </font></p>
