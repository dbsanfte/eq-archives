We've spent a lot of time the past few months polishing off epics and working on those bigger levels. We're getting better and better, which was proven yesterday afternoon when CoN with some Tindi/NB friends took down Gorenaire. A total of 35ish turned out for the beat down. After a couldy start, we eventually took him down. Grats to <font color=green>Aeguvas</font> on his white scale, <font color=green>Drugan</font> and <font color=green>Blackwynde</font> on their epic books, Drugan for his Runed Bolster Belt, and to the 4 lucky recipients of the 4 spells dropped<br><br>

I don't know if that's true or not, but I'm sure it's pretty close. Grats to Ammon and Collossus on their Scales, Suzzarita on her ring, Carin for his 4th map, and whoever got the club<li>The guild meeting on Friday night seemed to have gone well.

After a barrage of incoming Dark Elves, and random pulls (nice try Lemminglee.. lol), the General was pulled into our camp, and died soon there after. Grats to <font color=green>Dord</font> on having one step left to finishing his epic. He's looking for a SMR to basically finish it up, so if you have one you'd like to donate or sell, please give any CoN a hollar.<br><br>

Llith heard that fear was empty and that the bwoken golem was up.. dunno..
but when someone that can cast an icecomet at you asks you to come help and
beat it up, you don't say no. Anyway, so we gathered in Fear and and
mister Tealke handed in his piece, and POOF, this big golem pops. Lady
Rapunzara made it mad and we fought it foreeeeeever! And we won! *smiles happily* Mister Tealke got one of his last pieces</i></center></font>

<br><br><li>This seems like a repeat from yesterday but granted it's not. At the crack of dawn, Mellilu poked her head into Iceclad to see the beautiful sunset. Low and behold you can guess what she found. Lodizal went down again. Scale went to Lagenad, Sekhar scored the 4th map and a pair of LodizalShell Boots, second pair is being held by Derek, and 4 spells that have yet to be distriubuted.

<font size=2 color=blue><b>April 16, 2002</font><font size=2 color=red><b> - TROMPEN GETS EPIC!</font><BR><br><li>Talk about a totally awesome day. Coming straight off of a pretty solid weekend, we basically went straight into hitting a gold mine. Our total and incredibly huge server wide grats to <font color=green>Trompen</font> for finally picking up the last peice for his epic. I know we're all wiping our brow for that one. And such a HUGE turnout to help take down Ragefire. I'll let Torquil tell us exactly what happened<br><br><font color=green><i><center>Ragefire - 4/16/02 10:07am est Rage popped minutes before Trompen was to log for work. We made a few tells to various guilds: Tindi, NB, FK, BotS, asking to come and assist. 43 people were in zone when we engaged the evil beast with more en route. The server response and support was truly something awesome to witness. Obviously overkill, the battle lasted just over a minute. We engaged at 10:51am est and 1 minute later a dead dragon lie at our feet. Heart went to Trompen, Helm went to Sheanna, and there are 2 dragon bags to be awarded yet</font></i></center><br><center><a href="news/trompen.jpg"><img src="news/trompen_small.jpg"></a></center><br><br><li>Yet another awesome turn of events. Sev popped in EJ and after a good fight, we took him down. Congrats to <font color=green>Hammerhol</font> for his scale! 2 more steps and we'll add yet another set of glow sticks to the aggro arsenal<li>Of course I bring even more good tidings. <font color=green>Cartox</font> and <font color=green>Mellilu</font> are the newest server recipients to sport their new Lodizal Shell Shields. 3 people reported that it was a close fight due to the small numbers that showed up due to being in Sky, but they got him. And get this, when Cartox just happened to die in Sky, she popped back to her bind point in Ice Clad to conveniently find her spawn (that she'd been camping for a few weeks) to be up! Talk about sweet timing! Grats to Trompen for his Knotted Turtlebone Ring, Blackwynde for the 4th map for the Eyepatch of Plunder Quest, and Aridar for his Lodizal Shell Boots. Thanks to all who helped<br><br>

<li>We got word that the Broken Golem was up in Fear, so we worked out a deal with Victory not Vengeance to come in and kill him for Llith's epic piece. We then helped them with part of their shamans epic by helping kill 2 of the other named golems, Fright and Dread. Way to go VnV!<li>Woot to <font color=green>Trompen</font> for his near final epic peice in Chardock this weekend. We combined forces with Visionaries of Fire to later down the King and Queen, and supposedly all our clerics as well :) Thanks to all who attended and to VoF for their kindness<br><br><br>

<br><li>Something interesting. If you're looking for a way to build tons of faction with CoV, listen up. Last night, Torquil /gu'd that Delrone went from KoS to amiable in ONE NIGHT just from joining one of Noble Blade's ring wars in the Greater Divide. Granted these don't take place every day, but if you do hear about one going on and you need the faction, politely ask the guild if you can get in on it. The only strategy is to try to get around to every giant that attacks and to just hit them once! Insta-faction! Thanks Torquil for the report<li>I asked around and looked for a few lookalike pictures, I only came up with TWO! But you can judge which one is the winner :) Really there's no winner or loser, it's just fun to see the occasional exact replica walking around Norrath! Do you have a look-a-like?!<br><br>
