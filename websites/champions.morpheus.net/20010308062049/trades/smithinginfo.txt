* BLACKSMITHING GUIDE * 
***********************
So, you wish to learn the skills of a Master Blacksmith, impress your friends with 
your shiny new armor you made and make a bundle of plats off selling, eh? This may 
sound very rewarding, but the road to this is long and arduous! Before you read on, 
be aware that on average, it takes around 150pp to get good enough to make banded 
armor. Read on if you wish... 
Opinions may vary, but I am going to tell you how I mastered Smithing. 

NOTE!!!! Never stack components in the forge. This has to be the most annoying cause of 
failure and is a question I get asked a lot. If you get a strange failure message, 
make sure you didn't stack your components! 

Beginning Smithing (SKILL 1-27) 
I scrounged up rusty weapons wherever I could find them (fishing, hunting, buying, 
and sharpening other player’s weapons for free). Sharpening stones only cost 3cp in 
North Freeport, so this was fairly painless. To sharpen weapons, place the rusty 
weapon and 1 sharpening stone in the forge and click combine. I think around skill 
23-24, I got trivial with some weapons. You must then only sharpen Scimitars, 
Long Swords and Battle Axes to get improves. I got trivial on these at 27, so I 
moved onto the next phase... 

Apprentice Smithing (SKILL 27-35) 
This is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome phase at its best! At this phase, you will be 
doing scalers (files). To make scalers, combine 1 metal bit, 1 scaler mold, 
and 1 flask of water. To make a metal bit, put 2 chunks (the stackable ones) 
of ore and 1 flask of water (make sure the water is NOT summoned!) and hit 
combine. Do this over and over and over! If you succeed on the scalers you will 
get a container lid mold (still don't know why!) and a file. You can actually 
break even at this phase if you succeed regularly. Make scalers til you hit 35. 
I then switched to Lantern Casings. I made lanterns from 35 to 55 or so, at which 
point they became trivial as well. 

Journeyman Smithing (SKILL 55-65) 
This is a phase where each person kind of goes his or her own way. We will be 
making skewers here. Skewers can take you all the way up to 115 skill. Skewers 
require 1 metal bit, 1 flask of water and 1 skewer mold. Cost per skewer attempt 
is 2-3gp. Don't be discouraged if you fail alot, you can still get improves on 
failures! 

Expert Smithing (SKILL 65-80) 
Continue to make skewers at this point. I have tried banded pieces and the problem 
is that failures are very expensive. You need two pieces of metal (~1-2pp each, and 
a mold (~2gp-2pp each), so you can be set back quite a large amount on 5 failures. 

Master Smithing (SKILL 80+) 
Start raking in the plats. As you get higher and higher you will notice certain 
banded items no longer give you skill, eventually resulting in the need to make 
mostly tunics, leggings, and cloaks. 

TIPS
==================================
Here's some other things I have found over the past few weeks that I wanted to 
pass on. I have no way of verifying these tips quantitatively. I can only speak 
from experience. I may be totally wrong. 

..Get the books. Books are goooood.. 
==================================
I have heard that if you keep the smithing books in your inventory, you will gain 
skill faster and fail less often. I can only speak from experience when I say this 
SEEMS to be the case. I fail much less often and gain skill quicker when I have 
them on my person while at the forge. It doesn't hurt. Try it. 

..Get +INT items.. 
==================================
I got a +INT ring from our esteemed Kitty some time ago, and it has helped my skill 
increases. Any +INT stuff you can find is good. If you can get your INT over a number 
evenly divisible by 5, all the better. I have heard this helps. 

..Buy in Bulk.. 
==================================
I tend to go on smithing jags, where i make a TON of things at the same time. Doing 
this has led me to believe that I have better luck the longer I stand at the forge. 
In other words, I get more skill increases after I have made 20 of something than 
after I've made 10. This may be just me ...who knows. Note that this is all AT THE 
SAME time. Buy a lot of bags. I will generally make 60-80 metal bits (ugh), then 
go to east freeport and buy 100 water or so and 30-40 molds. Then I go to town! 

..Take off the Grotesque Mask.. 
==================================
... before buying supplies. Doh!

ARMOR AC VALUES
------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a list to help you determine armor upgrades. I would LOVE to 
incorporate this with relative armor weights as well so if anyone has some time 
to gather data on this, or knows of a webpage containing this info, let me know. 

Key - R=Ringmail B=Banded Z=Bronze 

Gorget 
R:5 / B:5 / Z:6 

Bracer 
R:5 / B:6 / Z:7 

Boots 
R:5 / B:6 / Z:8 

Helm 
R:7 / B:8 / Z:10 

Mask 
R:none / B:4 / Z:5 

Belt 
R:5 / B:6 / Z:7 

Sleeves 
R:6 / B:7 / Z:8

Leggings 
R:7 / B:8 / Z:10 

Cloak

Tunic/Mail 
R:12 / B:15 / Z:17



The following is a list of banded types and what skill level these things become 
trivial. Some of them are approximate. I will update the page as I get exact amounts.

Gorget 102 
Bracers 102 
Boot >102 
Belt >102 
Mantle >114
Cloak 175 
Mask >102 
Sleeves >114
