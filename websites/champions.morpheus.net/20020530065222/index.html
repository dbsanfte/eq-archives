Cough..<li>Can't say I've seen this done before, but it's obviously doable. Mellilu was watching the beautiful sunset in Iceclad a few days back when what else would she see but the wonderful CoN Lodizal. We really should make him an honorary member of our guild. It's kinda sad how many times he's died just in the past 2-3 months. I doubt the 8 kill tab on him is anywhere near right. Heh. Anyway, Mellilu, Pokee, Carin, and Lagenad downed him with just 4 people. Woot to them on the new ring and shield<br><br>

<li>CoN adds another warrior epic to it's massive list of, heh.. 2? ;) Another successfuly Chardok raid to pick off a few more epics. Massy reports on Saturday's events<br><br><center><i><font color=green>
We had chardok today.. was gweat!! Were a little low on people at first
though. We had one wipe out cause of a bug. There was a spot with a
hundred skelly's!! And lag was soooo bad, noone could move. So, we
ae'ed it all with just clerics and dwuids and 1 mage i think! No wizzies! Was GWEAT! Anyway, we moved in, beat up the pwince, moved on, beat up the king, then moved on, and beat up the queen with less than
24 people! Mister Kylerian got the pwince's head, lady Aytelya got the Chardok note
for the cleric epic, and mister Hammerhol got his epic!! We had tons of loot dwop too. One of the biggest things was a Incarnadine Bweastplate, lady Xaintai got it :) In short, it went fast, it went smooth, and it went gweat! Definitly one of the best Chardok raids I've ever seen!!</i></font><br><br><a href="news/hammer.jpg"><img src="news/hammer_small.jpg" alt="I AM a Jedi Master!"></a><br><br><br></center>

<li>Guild meeting tonight at 10PM EST. Be there or be square (lame)
<li>I bear bad news from the homefront. My wife and I's apartment is in shambles due to massive water damage, so we're basically forced to move out tomorrow. We've had our lease pushed up 2 months to accomodate the impossible living conditions, so my in game time will be severely limited. Cable modem gets cancelled tomorrow and I won't have DSL installed in my new house until June 13th. I WILL however continue to update the website as long as people continue to send me news. I still have my phatty connect from work to help out with that. Thanks for your patience and I'll see you all in a month!<br><br><br>
<font size=2 color=blue><b>May 15, 2002</font><font color=red size=2> - IT'S A BABY GIRL</font><BR><br>
<li>A very warm welcome to Trompen's new baby girl. Grace Catherine Knowles was born on 5/13/2002 at 7:50PM. 8 Lbs, 20 1/4 inches. Very healthy other than a slight temperature that was gone the very same night. Please feel free to send him and his family your congratulations. May she grow up to be as strong and selfless as her proud father. Our hearts and prayers go out to you and your new daughter<br><br><center><img src="news/trompbaby.jpg"></center><br><br><li>Phinny went down this morning except no Staff like the other day. Two (crappy) rogue piercers and ore. Pokee got a piercer and the ore, the other piercer rotted. Just a fun <a href="news/phinny.jpg">screenshot</a> of Massy and the early morning gang paying their respects to the local aqua trash ;)

<font size=2 color=blue><b>May 14, 2002</font><font color=red size=2> - MARRIAGE ANNOUNCEMENT</font><BR><br>
<li>Great news this week! A large congratulations to <font color=green>Bindor</font> and <font color=green>Ashlynn</font> on their EQ Engagement. They would like us to join them sometime in the near future in honoring them at their wedding. Dates are to yet be decided, but according to Bindor they are booking reservations for Sphynx Isle in the Plane of Sky. Get those reservations in soon! June/July are hell months for wedding plans ;) Champions of Norrath salutes you and gives you our deepest gratitude<br><br>
<center><i><font color=green>You say, 'M'Lady Ashlynn - I speak seldom from the heart - but would you do me the honor of becoming my wife?' You kneel before Ashlynn in humility and reverence. Ashlynn says, 'twould be an honour milord to bear thy name :))) Chesse tells the guild, 'My friends, I have an announcement to make...Father Bindor Zadd has asked the Lady Ashlynn's hand in marriage, and the Lady has accepted. Let there be joy in the lands!'</i></font></center><br>
<li>Please help me in congratulating <font color=green>Katerena</font> on her long venture to reaching level 60. That's a little over 20+ level 60's in the guild now. Wow! Way to go CoN
<li>Jezmyne was so kind as to toss me a pic of her and Trompen fishing just this weekend. We can tell who has the higher skill since Jezzy seemed to have fell in one too many times. Just for laughs<br><br><center><a href="news/fishing.jpg"><img src="news/fishing_small.jpg"></a></center><br><br><li>Please be advised: Guild meeting THIS Friday at 10:00PM EST. Same bat time, same bat channel. Also, we'll be pushing for our 2nd guild warrior epic this Saturday in Chardok, at Noon EST. Please do your best to be there promptly. We need your help!<li>Last but of course not least, a few CoN members had the opportunity to meet up with each other this weekend in Tulsa. What a blast it was.

<li>Tuven sent me something utterly hilarious via email the other day. At first I was like dang thats some sweet AE happening there between a mag and druid. But then I had to read closer. A mage pet?

<center><i><font color=green>Tuven and Hastur in the land of the dark elf... I've attached some pictures
of our romp in the lands of Mistmoore from earlier today. I had the opportunity to test drive one of these babies today in the Castle of Mistmoore. Let me tell you, the handling was incredible! The epic pet was quick to respond, yet strong enough to cause some minor headaches on the local population. Its not too good at cleaning up for itself though, and does tend to run a little hot after a while ("Give me more targets master!"). It also tends to play a bit heavy handed with the damage,
leaving melee groupmates feeling a bit slow to respond</center></i></font><br>

For instance, as a Shissar snake, he was procing immoluate. And as that 4 armed thingy, he was able to quad attack. Holy! As far as he knows, no one else has this spell on the server yet.

We congratulate you and celebrate with you for all of your hard work<li>With the undead bard being up in Seb, we decided to help Aeguvas finish his epic. Several groups of CoN, a group of Dragonslayers, and one random group of CoN friends went down to Trak's lair killing everything along the way. We buffed up, Aeguvas turned in his item, aggroing the undead bard. After we tore him apart, Trakanon spawned and was quickly put out of his misery. The fight lasted roughly 40 seconds with only a few deaths. Aeguvas was awarded the guts which he used for his epic and Ammon was awarded the Rogue Breastplate. Way to go guys!<br><br>

<li>A fun filled night of AE blasting Fear always seems to have it's upside and downsides. Luckily a cleric got out in time or this train would have been the end of the group. I'd say this takes Asturn's record in ME except for the fact that this one was intentional. Sad to say the group DID get wiped, but they were back on their feet again shortly
<li>On the 21st, a group of CoN that was hunting in Akheva for exp and a 
couple quest items was allowed to join Tindi as they attacked the boss mob 
of the zone, the Itraer Vius. Present were Ammon, Aridar, Asturn, Fait and 
Trompen. The attack unfortunately ended in failure after some bad luck, but 
the boss was down to about 60%. I expect Tindi will take him down soon since 
they are certainly capable of it. Here's a snap of CoN and Tindi charging the mob<br><br>

<li>The biggest news goes to <font color=green>Dord</font> and <font color=green>Tealke</font> on completing their epics. You guys have toiled long and hard on getting these uber items, and your diligence has finally paid off. We'll get a pic of these guys toting their new epics as soon as they are sent to me
