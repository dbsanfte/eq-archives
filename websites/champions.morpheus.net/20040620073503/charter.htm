<p>Champions of Norrath</font></strong><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">These rules are to be adhered to by every member of the Champions of Norrath. Any
indiscretion of said rules would be grounds for tribunal by the senior members of council.
An inquisition would be held, and a decision with or without punishment will be rendered.</font> </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Mission Statement</font></b><font face="Verdana"><br>
<font SIZE="2"><br>
The Champions of Norrath is a guild dedicated to promoting honorable and courteous
behavior among players both in and out of the guild. <br>
<br>
It is our belief that working together in harmony increases the enjoyment of adventures in
Norrath while also allowing us to accomplish more as individuals and as a guild. <br>
<br>
We welcome those who act with kindness, respect and consideration for others regardless of
race or class. The ideal champion will be a player who enjoys helping others, enjoys the
company of friends and can be respectful of others in all situations. Our guild values
honesty, integrity, friendliness and honor. <br>
<br>
We have established certain rules and guidelines because we want our members to know what
is expected of them and what behaviors the guild will not tolerate. We understand that we
all make mistakes at times, we will all stumble, but with a guild family's support, good
communication and understanding, we attempt to correct our mistakes and be better
Champions for what we learn from each experience.<br>
<br>
We are not a guild for everyone. We do not try to be. We strive to maintain the regard for
each other that has helped us remain strong through many adversities since April 11, 1999.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">One Guild<br>
</font></b><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"><br>
To avoid possible conflicts of interest, we require that the Champions of Norrath members
NOT belong to any other guilds on the Rathe server.<br>
<br>
If you feel there are special circumstances that require you to have characters in more
than one guild on the Rathe server, contact Karas or another officer to request permission
PRIOR to joining another guild. If a member if found to have characters in other guilds,
the member will be contacted and asked to chose one guild.</font><strong><font SIZE="5"></p>

<p>Guild Etiquette
  </font></strong> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  When in the presence of other guild members, you are expected to maintain a certain
    decorum.<br>
    Please refrain from vulgar language or crude expressions.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  When dealing with members from another guild, show them the respect you would show your
    own guild members. Remember that they can become powerful allies!</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  When speaking to officers about a problem, please use /tell's. Privacy is a must.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  In guild chat, be mindful of others. It's hard to concentrate on adventuring when
    endless text is scrolling by. Keep the conversations meaningful. They can be about RL or
    RPG life.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Please use the officers! They are there to handle minor problems and discretions. Keep
    /tell's to the GM at a minimum. /Tell's are for conversation meant <i>not to be </i>heard
    by others. If it isn't that important, then /guildsay is fine.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  If you are being barraged by non guild members about how to join, tell them they need to
    be sponsored by a officer of the guild.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Be aware that no matter where you go, you are representing the guild. Your actions &amp;
    words are a direct reflection on us. Be careful how you conduct yourself in public. Show
    people what it&#146;s like to be a true Champion.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">When speaking over guildsay, you will want to remember
that there are many age ranges and even children that are in our guild family that play.
Terms and their meanings such as &quot;crack&quot; (clarity) , &quot;The Ass room (assasin
in lguk)&quot; may not be perceived the same way by a juvenile as we know them to mean in
game. Please be aware of this and that time zones vary widely so there really never is an
&quot;adults only&quot; time in guildchat.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;

<p><strong><font face="Verdana">Combat</font> 

<ul>
</strong>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Upon entering a known creature spawn location, any existing &quot;campers&quot; or
    &quot;campers&quot; that arrive will be asked about rotating &quot;kills&quot;. This is
    done to prevent &quot;kill stealing&quot;.
</font>

 </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  When engaging an NPC currently in combat with another player, you may not loot the
    corpse until the combat is over and you have been granted permission by the player who
    originally engaged the NPC. This is to prevent the appearance of &quot;kill
    stealing&quot;, as game delays will often give false information as to the status of the
    combat leading to accidental competition for the same NPC, or leading you to believe you
    are saving someone who is not actually in danger
</font>

 </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  If there is a dispute with non-members about a kill, screen capture the text. Handle the
    situation in a calm, honorable manner. No matter what language they use, keep yours clean.
</font>

  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  If a situation seems unsolvable, do a &quot;/who champions all&quot; to see what
    officers are online. Notify them immediately and let them take over the situation.
</font>

 </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  NO RETALIATION will be tolerated! If you stoop to that level, you are stooping below the
    ideals that the Champions of Norrath hold.
</font>

 </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Be courteous to your fellow guildmates in your party. Do not go out and pull MOBs
    without asking the others in your group. Spellcasters need time to regenerate mana.
    Obvious careless acts that cause other guild members harm will not be tolerated.
</font>

<p>Loot and Etiquette</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">I. The Planes</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">When a member of CoN is in the planes (Fear, Hate, Sky, etc.), he/she should be aware
    of the looting rules so conduct will not become an issue</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">Guild Event</font></li>
  <p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">A loot table has been created with all planable members.&nbsp; This will track who has
  what and works on a rotating basis.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">Special items such as God drops etc are also on a separate table and will be dealt with
  accordingly.</font></p>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">As a guest</font> </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">When any member of CoN is a guest of another group or guild that is in the planes, it
    is imperative that discussions of loot outside of basic inquiry (&quot;what is a X?&quot;
    etc) be kept to a minimum. Loot will be distributed by the inviting guild as they see fit.
    The invite should be used as a learning experience or for fun&#133;nothing more.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">II. Loot in regular groups</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">If there is a group consisting solely of CoN members, then loot will be distributed on
    a &quot;need first&quot; basis. If there are more than 1 persons that need the item, then
    those persons can determine there and then if they wish to roll, or to let one take the
    item with the understanding that the other will have priority over the next person on next
    drop.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">If no member of the party has a direct need of the item, it can be distributed either
    by agreement or /random amongst all party members. It is recommended that loot be
    distributed to guild members in need of said item before it is auctioned or traded but
    this is by no means required. It is understood that members may occasionally want to trade
    or sell items for their personal benefit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">In mixed groups on a non CoN function (by which it&#146;s understood that non CoN
    functions are random pick up groups), items will be dealt with by the group leader. If the
    group leader is a CoN, then the best course of action would be to have any
    &quot;need&quot; items rolled upon by any group members that can use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><br>
</font>
</font><font face="Verdana">Disputes</font></strong> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  All disputes will be brought to the attention of an officer of Champions of Norrath <i>IMMEDIATELY</i>.
    Screen shots are recommended, since this will give the officers a more accurate picture of
    what was being said and/or going on.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Expect to be interviewed. Once a dispute has been reported, <u><i>any</i></u> officer
    may approach you to ask what happened. There will be &quot;on call&quot; officers that
    will handle the situation if it is on their shift, to prevent multiple inquiries.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  After a dispute has been reported, and the facts from involved parties reviewed, the
    council will then decide on the proper ruling, if any, to be handed down to the involved
    persons.</font></li>

<strong><font FACE="Verdana"><p>Member Deguilding / Reguilding Policy<br>
  </p>

<blockquote>
  </font></strong><p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">First Deguilding:</font><font
  FACE="Verdana"> </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  </font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  The ex-member must post their desire to return in the Seeking Membership forum. An
    explanation of the deguilding is not required, however the interest to return must be
    posted.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Officers review the reasons the ex-member deguilded, the reputation the ex-member had
    with the guild and decide if the ex-member's reapplication will be accepted. A majority
    vote of the officers is required for the reapplication process to continue.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  If reapplication is denied, the ex-member will be informed by email that reapplication
    is rejected. The post for reapplication will be removed from the boards.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  If reapplication is approved, the officers arrange a meeting with the ex-member. At
    least two officers will be present to log the discussion and review any concerns of the
    ex-member and the officers. Any expectations or requirements on both sides will be
    reviewed.</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  The ex-member and officers must agree to the terms on both sides before temp membership
    will be considered.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  The ex-member will be out of the Champions for approximately one month before taking the
    tag again. This time is suggested to allow the ex-member to truly resolve the problems
    that caused the initial deguilding and to make it clear that deguilding is a serious thing
    and should not be done without serious consideration.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  During this time they are allowed to participate in guild groups as normal. No member is
    required to invite them, but if there are no hard feelings, the ex-member will be welcome.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Raid attendance must be approved in advance by raid leaders.</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Planes raid attendance must be approved by normal procedures. Karas must grant approval
    prior to planes raid attendance.</font></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  NOTE: During these crucial steps in the re-application process, it would be prudent if
  the petitioning ex-member did not press the officers or push for constants updates, as
  these discussions take time and are of a sensitive nature. Continuing to do so will
  reflect negatively on possible return.</font><font FACE="Verdana"> </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  </font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Active members of the guild may express their opinions of the ex-member by telling an
    officer or emailing an officer. Please do NOT post these opinions on any forums. If the
    guild as a whole seems to favor or reject an ex-member's reapplication, the officers will
    take this into consideration.
    </font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Prior to the next guild meeting, officers will review the ex-member's behavior during
    the separation period, the officer meeting log, any new concerns in addition to the
    ex-member's actions. If the ex-member has not been very active in game during this period,
    more time may be required to make a determination. Absence is not a positive thing in this
    situation.
    </font>
 </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Officers then take a FINAL vote on whether to offer the temp tag back to this ex-member.
    ALL officers must agree to accept this person back or review what other requirements are
    needed. This is the most crucial step and requires a unanimous vote. Otherwise the
    ex-member will only cause more stress by coming back.
    </font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  If approved, the ex-member will be given a temp tag at the next guild meeting.
    </font>
 </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  During the next month, that member is on probation and may be deguilded if any problems
    or concerns arise, just as a normal New member.
    </font>
 </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  If the temp period completes successfully, the member then becomes a Permanent member
    again at the next guild meeting and when in the planes, goes to the bottom of the class
    loot list, just as any other New member.
    </font>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Deguilding a SECOND time will mean permanent banishment from the guild. No review, no
    reconsideration. The only exception to this will be IF the member discussed the reasons
    for leaving and the intention to return at a later date with Karas. If no prior approval
    was granted BEFORE the member deguilds a second time, there will be no returning to the
    guild at a later date.<br>
    <br>
    We encourage our members to discuss problems and concerns BEFORE they become something so
    upsetting that deguilding seems to be the only solution.<br>
    <br>
    Please talk to the officers prior to issuing the guild remove command.
    </font>

</blockquote>

<p><font FACE="Verdana"><strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rewards &amp; Recognition</strong> 

<ul>
  </font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Members that go above and beyond the call of duty as a Champion become eligible for
    recognition, and possibly reward. Rewards will be defined at a later date.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana" SIZE="2">
  Guild member may nominate members of the guild, and may also nominate Non-members, for
acts deemed worthy of recognition. Non members will be officially recognized by the guild
master. (example: non member grouped with members risks his life to save our members in a
combat situation. This is Champion of Norrath behavior, and recognizing the individual may
also become a good recruiting tool).</font></p>
