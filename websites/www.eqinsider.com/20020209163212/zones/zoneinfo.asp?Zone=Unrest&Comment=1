<b>Getting there</b>
<br><br>
Unrest can be found off of Dagnor's Cauldron, which is in turn off of the Butcherblock Mountains. To reach Unrest after zoning into the Cauldron: Follow the long, winding gorge path that brings you to the heart of the Cauldron. Once the high walls fall away, continue a short distance up the slope in front of you until you see the water-line directly ahead and the NPC camp to your right. These NPCs are "Good" and will help you if you are of a good race and have decent faction. It is worth noting that these NPCs are not extremely high in level and they take a while to kill creatures such as Aqua Goblin Tidal Lords - luckily there are several NPCs here to help. Evil races and classes should most likely avoid this camp - although one of the NPCs is a Gnome. Also in the water is a Dwarf NPC that will give a quest for poison components.
<br><br>
Once you have reached this point (water in front, NPC camp on the right), I have found that the best path to take is to continue on to the water's edge, turn right and start running (keeping the water on your left). The entrance to Unrest is about a 2 minute non-SOWed run. The entrance will be the typical cave in the side of the mountain that you see often in EQ. During this run you will most likely see several Aqua Goblins and you will pass their main camp. Just stay between Goblin camp and the water-line and they should not bother you. The real dangers are the wandering Aqua Goblins that criss-cross the Cauldron (lake). These jump in and out of the water and roam the shores. Avoid them when you can. When you can not, if you are too low of level to fight, you will have to train them to the Unrest entrance and zone in (or to the Butcher zone if you are leaving). Please remember to call out that you are training to the zone point - especially if you are training Tidal Lords to the Unrest entrance as their will be many players recuperating just outside. The other danger for this zone comes from the severe drops that appear out of nowhere, especially if you have limited or no night vision.
<br><br>
The Goblins are the biggest danger in the Cauldron and they range from the high-teens to the mid-twenties in level. You will also find Undertow Skeletons (high-teens), Rats (12-14ish I think), Giant Snakes (non-aggro, in the lower teens) and an Orc Camp (never tangled with them but I assume they are in the mid-teens). There is also a named Undertow Skeleton in the zone that sometimes drops a set of mediocre shoulderpads that have decent AC and add to your save vs cold.
<br><br>
<b>Physical layout</b>
<br><br>
Unrest is a small zone. Much smaller than many of the 'dungeon" zones. The basic layout is: A long hallway that leads from the entrance to the courtyard. The courtyard is a medium-sized square area with a pair of fountains. A path runs between the fountains. If you continue on the path past the fountains, you will come to the mansion. The courtyard and the mansion are separated by a small hedge-maze. This is not really a maze and just lends an aesthetic touch to the zone.
<br><br>
The mansion sits in the middle of the larger square area on this side of the maze. This is the meat of the zone. There are three doors leading to the first floor of the house - one in the front, one on the left side and one in the back. Players will use all of these doors to pull mobs out to their groups who typically wait along the walls on the edge of the zone.
<br><br>
The house has 3 floors and a basement. There are a few stairways within the house that will take you to the various levels. Not all rooms on each level connect and can sometimes only be reached by a particular stairway. The basement is found behind a secret doorway on the first floor. If you were to enter the house by the front door and take the left-most hallway towards the rear of the house, you would find this bookcase behind the second door on your left (in this left-hand hall). One click and you have found the passageway to hell.
<br><br>
<b>Mobs & Areas</b>
<br><br>
The outside of the house (lawn) and the floors help separate the different levels of creatures. There are several "special" mobs in this zone which I will describe separately after this section.
<br><br>
On the lawn and in the courtyard you will find what the higher levels refer to as "yard trash." These are the Death Beetles, Greater Skeletons, Tormented Dead (TD), Jack o' Lanterns and sometimes a low level Ghoul. These range from the mid-teens to the high-teens and can be very dangerous as they are aggro to players in this level range and they like to swarm - especially the beetles. --The loot for this area consists of the standard loot for most low-level areas of EQ - small amounts of coin, some cloth or cheap armor, rusty weapons with the occasional bronze weapon, and the best loot comes from the various poison components dropped here, such as Aminita Phalloids, and grave mold.
<br><br>
The first floor of the house contains Ghouls, Dark Boned Skeletons, Lurking Mummies and, sometimes, a Dry Boned Skeleton. These creatures are in the upper teens and can be quite tough for groups around the same level (Dry Bones are in the 20's). On the first floor, like elsewhere in the house, the mobs spawn close together and there may be those that you do not see hiding behind doors or walls. Everything in the house is aggro to those who are not very high of level. Also, many of the mobs from this point on start requiring magical weapons to be hit. --The loot for this area consists of runes, words, pages, rawhide and ring armor, and bronze weapons.
<br><br>
On the second floor of the house will you find Dry Boned Skeletons, Skeletal Monks, Carrion Ghouls, Werebats and Barbed Bone Skeletons. These baddies range from the low 20's to the high 20's and have some interesting characteristics. The Drys cast fire-based spells. The monks hit hard and fast - you will see them using some of the monk's special attacks. The Carrions will root you often and beat the heck out of you. Bats are quick little beasts who hit for fast damage. The Barbeds will possibly be your first glimpse into the "Goodness, how many hit points does this thing have?!?" arena, and some of them are casters as well. All of the Barbeds hit VERY hard. You will also find the Reclusive Ghoul Magi on the 2nd Floor. He will be noted a bit later. --The loot in this area is most player's initiation to "the Good Life." Here you will find small bronze armor (mostly on the Drys) and fine steel weapons.
<br><br>
The third floor of the mansion is not all that different from the second when it comes to the normal spawns. Here you will find the Drys, Monks, Barbeds and CG's. However, the third floor is a bit different than the others as it is not as much of a true floor as it is a series of rooms that have different access stairways. I will go into some of these rooms in the next section as most of them hold the "special" mobs, but the new arse-kickers that you will find in these rooms are Hags, Greater Dark Bones, an Undead Knight, a Reanimated Hand, Zombie Nobles and an Undead Barkeep. All of these new baddies are levels 24-30 and can really dish out the damage. The Greater Dark Bones (GDBs), Hags and the Nobles are not truly "special" mobs as they do not drop specific items, but they are some of the toughest in the zone and worthy of a description in that section. --The loot is the same as the second floor with the exception of the special mobs.
<br><br>
<b>The Basement</b>
<br><br>
Last, but certainly not least, we shall look at the basement. This was that pit of hell I referred to earlier. Here you will find many of the same mobs that we have seen on the second and third floor, but you will see a lot more of them and they tend to be higher level than elsewhere. Again, the basement is behind the bookcase on the first floor. The basement has a main area and another secret area behind a false wall. In the main area of the basement you will find Hags (and lots of them!), Werebats, Monks, Barbeds and some very tough GDBs. Behind the secret wall - which is up the first set of stairs in the main area if you just keep heading in from the entrance - you may find more Hags and GDBs, a Mortuary Fungus, Tentacle Terrors and of course, Garanel Rucksif, the lvl 37ish Dwarven Spirit. All of these will be described in the next section. **NOTE: if you go through the false wall and down the hall to the point where you see a pool of lava directly in front of you and what appear to be walkways on either side - walk THROUGH the lava. It will not hurt you. The walkways are traps and you will fall into a pit, taking damage and possibly coming face-to-face with a tough basement denizen.
<br><br>
There is also an underwater cave in the stream by the Gazebo to the right of the house  that contains a strange little Gnomish Spelunker and a high level MOB spawn (typically a Monk or Hag). The Gnome will attack you if you pull the MOB. The Gnome is about level 24.
<br><br>
<b>Special Mobs</b>
<br><br>
Greater Dark Bones are this zone's ultimate undead tank. These level 28-30 baddies hit for 50+ damage and potentially have 1000's of hit points. They are found in the third floor Knight Balcony and in the basement. --They have poor loot unless they are carrying piece of bronze armor or a FS weapon.
<br><br>
Festering Hags are perhaps the most feared creature in the zone - though they are not necessarily the toughest. Hags are casters pure and simple. If you don't let a Hag cast, you may live. They have a good amount of hit points but are not great at fisticuffs. Have the entire party melee Hags so they can not cast. If they do hit you with one of their spells, be ready to take 200+ damage if you are under level 25. Rush them, hit them, nuke them - do not let one stand and cast from afar or you will lose several group members before she decides to come in close and melee. Hags are found in the Basement and on the Knight Balcony.  --Hags carry decent amounts of coin, gossimer armor, fine steel weapons and other random items.
<br><br>
Zombie Nobles are similar to a GDB. They hit hard and have a lot of hit points. They are found in the Barroom with the Undead Barkeep. --They have poor loot unless they are carrying piece of bronze armor or a FS weapon.
<br><br>
The Mortuary Fungus spawns behind the secret wall in the basement. He is a 26-28ish MOB that hits (fairly) hard and has a decent amount of hit points. His main weapon is a very powerful Drowsy spell that makes tanks swing like they are in molasses. Nuke him as much as you can because the tanks will not be able to do much damage. --I have never seen him carry more than a small amount of gold and possibly a cheap piece of jewelry.
<br><br>
Tentacle Terrors are level 28ish mobs that are also found behind the secret wall in the basement. They are usually guarding the Dwarven Spirit. These silly looking cone-heads hit hard, drain you with the occasional life-tap, and will throw you across the room using their tentacles. You typically do not take a lot of damage from being thrown, however this makes battle hard for one of two reasons: if your tanks keep getting thrown, they have to run back over and start hitting again; or sometimes the Terror will stay on the player that it has thrown and chase him across the room or lawn and the entire party will have to scramble to get back into melee. --So far I have not looted anything decent from a TT. They have yielded pretty much the same type of loot as the Fungus. 
<br><br>
The Reclusive Ghoul Magi is, as his name implies, a Ghoul Caster. He conjures a Necro skeleton pet and casts Boiling Blood, a painful DOT spell. he is around level 28. He spawns in one of the far back rooms on the second floor, near the back staircase that leads to the Barroom and Knight Balcony. --The Magi drops two good items - the Savant's Cap (+3 to WIS and INT) or the Blood Stained Gloves (+25 mana for Pure Casters).
<br><br>
The Reanimated Hand spawns in a third floor area that is off of the "Stuck Room" where you will find CGs and skeletons frozen in place - bugged. The Stuck Room is accessed via a flight of stairs found in the middle of the second floor. The Hand spawn is through the only door in this room. The Hand casts a powerful force spell, but, like the Hags, he can be interrupted easily. If the Hand can not cast, he is very easy to kill. He is typically around 26 in level. The Hand drops one of the most coveted items in the zone - the Ivory Bracelet (+3 AGIL and +20 mana).
<br><br>
The Undead Barkeep is found in the bar room of course. This room is in the back of the house off of the stairway that continues up to the Knight Balcony. The Keeper spawns behind the little structure that is shaped like a, you guessed it, bar. The Keeper is another level 26-28ish mob. --The Barkeep drops the Thick Leather Apron (8 AC, 1 weight) or the Opalline Earring (2 AC, +5 CHAR).
<br><br>
The Undead Knight of Unrest spawns on the third floor balcony that is often referred to as the Knight Balcony. This is at the very top of the staircase in the back of the house. The Knight is a 26-28ish undead Shadow Knight who will life-tap. He also casts other aggressive spells and has a pet. He is one of the most sought-after mobs in the zone for the loot he carries. --The Knight drops Bloodstained Tunics (12 AC +4 WIS +4 AGIL) and Bloodstained Mantles (+3 STR and +10 vs magic).
<br><br>
Garanel Rucksif spawns in the very back of the basement after the secret wall and false lava pool. He is usually accompanied by 2 Hags and 2 Tentacle Terrors. If you are going to take him on, make sure to get rid of his outer-most guards first. It is doubtful you will be able to take care of the two closest to him without Garanel coming as well. He is around level 35-37 and hits very hard and fast. I have been hit by him for four times in one round for 80+ damage each. Do not take him on without a full group of 30ish or higher levels. --Garanel drops the Dwarven Work Boots (8 AC, +3 STR, +5 DEX) or Jagged Bands (5 AC, +3 STR)
<br><br>
<b>Pulling</b>
<br><br>
This section will suggest reasonable pulling techniques for some general level ranges. Please note that this is very subjective and having a group member or two that is higher level than the suggested range will change things considerably.
<br><br>
<b>Levels 15-18</b><br>
If you're here before level 15, you are brave! (Admittedly many come here as early as 12-14 now): At this stage you should stick with the yard trash. Kill beetles, TDs, Greater Skeletons and Jacks. Some Jacks will be tough, even for a full group. Personally, I think that the Jacks are the most fun MOB in the game - hilarious pumpkin headed suckas. Get ready to run when you look down and see 10 beetles at your feet. They are meaner than they look. The best place to pull to will most likely be around Gazebo on the right side of the house. This area is literally crawling with low level critters and you are close enough to the zone to make a run for it. This is also the least likely place to get trained by high level mobs.
<br><br>
<b>Levels 17-18</b><br>
If your group is on the high end of the 15-18 range, you may want to try your hands at pulling from the first floor of the house. Be careful though, it is very easy to end up with more than you wanted to pull. Try out a few Dark Bones and Ghouls and see how you do. Then move on to Mummies. Remember, some of these guys take a magical weapon to hit, so if your tanks don't have a magical hitter, you are going to be in trouble. Also, the puller should always be ready for that unexpected Hag or Werebat to be wandering around on the first floor. These do not spawn here but may be returning to their rooms after someone pulled them and then zoned. When you first start playing with the house creatures, get ready to run a lot.
<br><br>
<b>Levels 19-25</b><br>
As a level 19+ Cleric in an undead zone, you will be in demand. You have some strong buff and healing spells as well as some decent undead-nukers. Use this to your advantage and work your way into some 20+ groups. The experience and loot will be much better. This is when Unrest gets fun. These groups will be taking on the second and third floor mobs. Make sure to heal first and nuke second unless you have a few Clerics. Always keep Hag watch for your group. If you see someone's health plummet, there is a good chance a Hag has attached itself to the puller. Hags like to come out of the house late in the battle and start casting from afar. Shout it to your party and have them rush her. If they don't react quickly, your puller is going to die. Always try and have at least two clerics in the group. One is the primary healer, the other nukes a bit but holds some mana back for heals as well. You will now want to start pulling to the left-side or back of the house to avoid the lower level creatures that will still attach themselves to your pulls at times. Also, there are some sites and people who suggest pulling to the front of the zone near the fountains. I assume that this is so you can zone faster if you pull too much. I maintain that this is a very bad idea as up there you are in "train alley" and will constantly have others group's trains attaching themselves to your fights. I hate to waste time zoning to get away from other people's mistakes.
<br><br>
<b>Level 25+</b><br>
This is where you will have to make a decision. A 25+ group is fully capable of camping any room in the house. either pull from the second floor, third floor and basement if they are not all taken by groups, or camp a room. It is up to you and your group. I would suggest not taking a seat in the basement until the group is around level 28 or so. At level 28+ we would sit in the basement for hours and I have not seen better experience for that level anywhere else in the game. But it gets rough down there and spawns have a way of hitting all at once. But since the only actual special MOB in the basement is Garanel and most people are not of the level to mess with him, we did not anger many people by camping that area.
<br><br>
Around level 30, experience becomes hard to get in Unrest unless you sit in the basement. At 30 most people move on to Cazic or other zones.

You can either get to it from Kaladim or if coming from the Antonica continent, take the boat in Freeport and wait until you reach Butcherblock Mountains. 
<br><br>
Unrest is a popular place indeed. The area is always crowded and you might encounter lag problems every now and then. But the amount of people here shouldn't diminish your experience as the Estate of Unrest houses a very large quantity of undead creatures. Unrest can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it can also be a deadly one. 
<br><br>
Unrest can be divided into 3 parts. At the front of the house you can find the weakest creatures in Unrest such as Greater Skeletons, Jack'O'Lanterns, and Tormented Deads. You should hunt here if you are in the upper teens (level 15+). The best way to do it is pull or have your tank pull one undead near the walls and close to the tunnel that leads to Dagnor's Cauldron. Make sure you get one at a time and be careful with the Death Beetles that wander all over Unrest. They will attack you if you are fighting an undead creature. 
<br><br>
Once you hit level 20+ you can start hunting creatures that dwell inside the Estate of Unrest. I would definitely stay outside the manor as camping inside it will most certainly lead to death. Set your party right next to the outer walls of Unrest and pull from the first floor of the manor. The creatures you can expect to battle are Ghouls, Darkbone Skeletons, Drybone Skeletons, Carrion Ghouls, and Skeleton Monks. As a rule of thumb, the deeper you go into the first floor, the harder the creatures will be. One tip I would give you is to know exactly what you will be doing once battle starts. As the outer walls of Unrest are heavily populated with players, it can be difficult to fully understand what is going on. Thus, the use of the /assist command can come in handy. You should at least tell your party to take out the tougher creature first and then kill whatever came with the pull. 
<br><br>
After level 24, you can start heading inside the house for good. No more pulling to outer walls. There are plenty of things you can do inside the Estate of Unrest. The largest number of creatures your party should be looking for can be found in the basement. Getting to the basement can be tricky as the passage is somewhat hidden. The last door at the left hallway from front of the house has a bookshelf. If you click on it, it will open up the passage downstairs. At the basement you can find the toughest skeleton variations from Unrest (barbed and monks), and the unique and toughest creatures from this zone, the Werebats and the Festering Hags. Both the Werebat and the Hag are around level 29 and can hit very, very hard and really fast. At mid to upper 20s, you will last very little if no one comes to your aid. The experience and loot they provide is very rewarding though and worth the risk.
