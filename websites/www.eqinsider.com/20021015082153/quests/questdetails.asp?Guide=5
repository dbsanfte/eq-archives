So take that boat and head to the island where Gornit and several Seafury Cyclops spawn, at loc +800 -5400.  Once there, look for <b>Capt Surestout</b> at loc +780 -5390.  He is a Halfling Rogue, level 18 to 22, with approximately 500 HPs.  Kill Capt Surestout.
<br><br>
<b>2.</b> Once you kill Capt Surestout, a <b>Lesser Spirit</b> will spawn.  Hail it and the following conversation should take place:
<br><br>
<i>'Did you take this person's life, shaman?'</i>
<br><br>
Say 'Yes I did'
<br>
<i>'Why have you taken this person's life? Did he threaten your life? Did you dislike him? Or was his death a profit to you in some way?'</i>
<br><br>
Say 'He threatened my life'
<br>
<i>'I see. It brings me sadness to see another die, but his heart was black and a great nothingness. His body will become the grass now. Thank you for what you have done, shaman'</i>
<br><br>
Say 'Who are you?'
<br>
<i>'What, or who, I am isn't as important as what, or who, WE are. Do you wish to know more, shaman?</i>
<br><br>
Say 'I wish to know more'
<br>
<i>'That is good. Take this gem. It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits'</i>
<br><br>
<b>3.</b> He will then give you a <b>Tiny Gem</b>.  Head to North Freeport and go down the sewers in the northwestern part of town.  Once there, look for <b>Bondl Felligan</b> and give him the Tiny Gem.  He will say the following: <i>'WOW, thanks! This must be worth a fortune! I could drink for a month after sellin' this to one of them fool merchants. I'm going to see how much I can get for it right now'</i>!
<br><br>
<b>4.</b> Bondl will now walk outside the sewers and ask you if he can buy some booze with the gem.  Reply that he can buy the booze and follow him to the Jade Tiger's Den.
<br><br>
<b>5.</b> Once inside the Den, go up to the 3rd floor and into the room in the middle.  You will find a <b>Greater Spirit</b> inside.  Hail him and he will say the following: <i>'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do you follow [Justice], [War], [Fear], or [Hate]?</i>
<br><br>
<b>6.</b> You must answer accordingly to the God you follow.
<br><br>
<b>Barbarians</b> follow The Tribunal and should answer Justice.
<br>
<b>Iksar</b> follow Cazic Thule and should answer Fear.
<br>
<b>Ogres</b> follow Rallos Zek and should answer War.
<br>
<b>Trolls</b> follow either Cazic Thule or Innoruuk  If you follow Cazic Thule, you should answer Fear.  If you follow Innoruuk you should answer Hate.
<br><br>
<b>7.</b> The reply you get from this Spirit will depend on the God you follow.  The Spirit might ask you to leave the room and talk to another Spirit in a room next door.  Do as he says and talk to the Spirit he asks.
<br><br>
<b>8.</b> Talk to the correct <b>Greater Spirit</b> and he will say the following: <i>'It is good to see you. We're glad you trusted in our brother and did what was asked regardless of Bondl's intentions. This fills us with joy, as the [true spirits] work in ways most people would not understand and [trust] is the first lesson of the [Heyokah]'</i>.  Ask the Spirit 'What Heyokah' and it will give you a <b>Sparkling Gem</b>.  After his reply, and only after it, tell it that you will walk the path of the Heyokah.  The Spirit will then tell you that you need to go to Erud's Crossing and immediately despawn.
<br><br>
<b>9.</b> Do as the Spirit asked and head to Erud's Crossing.  There you must find an Ogre female called <b>Ooglyn</b>.  Hail her and give her the Gem. She will thank you and ask that you follow her for a swim.  Do so and when she disappears into the water, head to loc -1600 +4200.  Make sure you can breath underwater and dive down.  Ooglyn will be there (and if not, don't worry about it).  Just wait there and after quite some time, 5 different Spirits of Heyokah will spawn.  Do not leave this spot no matter what.  You will have to fight a few sharks and ignore some Spirits that tell you top leave that spot.
<br><br>
<b>9.</b> You are looking for two specific NPCs, Abe the Abandoned and a Greater Spirit.  Do not leave this spot until you talk to them and obtain another Gem and a Broken Arrow.
<br><br>
<b>10.</b> When <b>Abe the Abandoned</b> spawns, talk to him and follow the prompts.  When he says <i>'Heheheh, yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you? But I guess not'</i>, you must wait a bit until he speaks again.  When he does, he will ask you to give a <b>Broken Arrow</b> to his friends.  Accept the taks and wait a few minutes Abe will talk again, asking you to follow him.  Do not follow him.  Just stay where you are.
<br><br>
<b>10.</b> When a <b>Greater Spirit</b> spawns, which might happen before or after Abe, talk to him and he will say the following: <i>'You have walked the path of patience and you now know what to expect. We are watchers. Our eyes are everywhere and we must be patient and quiet else we may miss what could be harmful. Can you sit still quietly and wait for just the right moment, then open your eyes with a fury and act with all the energy you have cultivated? Timing is everything, and without patience you cannot be sensitive to timing. You have shown your patience here and we believe you are ready to walk the [next path]'</i>.  Ask about the next path and he will say that you must go to West Karana.
<br><br>
<b>11.</b> After speaking to both the Greater Spirit and Abe the Abandoned and obtaining the Broken Arrow and the Gem, head to West Karana and look for a <b>Wandering Spirit</b>.  You can find him at loc -500 -5300.  If he is not there, simply wait until he shows up.  Hail him and give him the Sparkling Gem.  He will say the following: <i>'Oh, it is you, shaman! Good! You must hurry before it's too late. Go now to the Mountains they call Rathe and find them! They need your help quickly! They will know you when they see you and instruct you on how you can help, but you must hurry!'</i>
<br><br>
<b>12.</b> Head to Rahe Mountains and look for two NPCs.  The first is called <b>Glaron the Wicked</b> and can be found at loc +2900 -1900.  Kill him and loot his two weapons, <b>Envy</b> and <b>Woe</b>.
<br><br>
<b>13.</b> The second NPC is called <b>Tabien the Goodly</b> and can be found at loc +6300 +1550.  Kill him and loot his shield, <b>Marr's Promise</b>.  Note that this shield is too big to fit into a backpack.
<br><br>
<b>14.</b> With the 3 items, Envy, Woe, and Marr's Promise, head back to West Karana and look for the Wandering Spirit once again.  Give him all 3 items and he will talk about a <b>Shield of Falsehood</b>.  Ask him 'What Shield of Falsehood' and he will explain that he took the 3 items you gave him and fashioned them together to create the Shield of Falsehood, which he gives you.  The Shield itself has the following stats:
<br><br>
<b>Shield of Falsehood<br>
AC16<br>
STR+3, WIS+5, INT+5, DEX-3, CHA-5, Mana+30</b>
<br><br>
<b>15.</b> Head to the Emerald Jungle and look for a <b>Spirit Sentinel</b>.  You can find him at loc +1250 +300.  Give him the <b>Sparkling Gem</b> the Wandering Spirit previously gave you and follow the conversation prompts.  You will learn that you must go to Mistmoore and eliminate one of his lost brothers.
<br><br>
<b>16.</b> He is talking about the Wolf Spirit <b>Black Dire</b> in Mistmoore.  So get yourself at least 1 full group and head to Mistmoore.  Black Dire is level 45 Shadow Knight and spawns every 3.5 hours by the ramp that leads up to the castle.  You may also trigger his spawn by killing the Advisor in the Library, the room beyond the sauna where the Soulfire Hilt drops.  Black Dire is guarded by 4 other wolfs.  Kill Black Dire and loot <b>Black Dire's Pelt</b>.
<br><br>
<b>17.</b> Go back to the Emerald Jungle and look for the <b>Spirit Sentinel</b> once again.  Hail him and he will say the following: <i>'We can only hope his passing was quick and painless. The Dire was powerful and yet you overcame him. Always remember that when you became [Heyokah], it was the passing of a noble, yet misguided being that allowed you to do so. You should hold a special place in your heart for him and what he was in life. To help you remember him, we will fashion this pelt into a pair of boots and give them to you.  With every step you take, you must think on the Dire, else his death be in vain forever'</i>.  He will then give you some nice <b>Black Fur Boots</b>.  The boots have the following stats:
<br><br>
<b>Black Fur Boots<br>
AC9<br>
STR+3 STA+3 WIS+3 AGI+3 SV Disease+3 SV Magic+5 SV Poison+3<br>
Effect: Spirit of Wolf</b>
<br><br>
The SoW effect is self only and instantly cast.  Now follow the conversation prompts and you will learn that you must go to the City of Mist, known as Torsis before its demise, and gather evidence of its demise.  He will also give you <b>Booklet</b> that you must use to combine your findings.
<br><br>
<b>18.</b> Head to the City of Mist and look for 6 different Reports.  Reports 1 to 5 drop from random Skeletons, Golems, and Goos in the zone.  The last report only drops from a <b>Spectral Courier</b>.  All reports are written in Lizardman.  You need to use Identify to know the report number.  Below is the information contained in each report:
<br><br>
<b>Personal Diary Page</b><br>
Identifies as <b>Report Information 1 of 6</b><br>
<i>'I heard last night that there was some kind of commontion at the castle. Guards were shouting, spells went off throughout the halls and many died. Some say there was an assassination, some say a band of frogloks attacked under the command of a dragon, some even say there was some divine intervention. I have no idea why any god would strike against Lord Rak`Ashirr. He is a paragon fro the cause of Cazic-Thule. I hope whatever it was sticks to attacking the castle and not my shop though'</i>
<br><br>
<b>Crier's Scroll</b><br>
Identifies as <b>Report Information 2 of 6</b><br>
<i>'Hear of all Torsis! Our beloved Lord Rak`Ashiir will be appointing another High Priest into the Cazic-Thule clergy in two days. A festival will be held in honor of the event and the High Scale will be present to judge various contests of skill in arms. Booths will be set up selling various wares and food to all. Cazic guide us all'</i>
<br><br>
<b>Merchant's Letter</b><br>
Identifies as <b>Report Information 3 of 6</b><br>
<i>'The list should all be in order except for the swatches of silk. I won't need such a large order in this quarter. Her Divinity Drian made it known to me that they would not need as many new robes this coming season as "none were quite ready to don them." My colleagues have all been confirming that the church is buying less and less these days. It seems Rak`Ashiir has decided the royal donation to be cut. However I'm sure we'll find new customers soon and our orders will be back to normal shortly'</i>
<br><br>
<b>Written Announcement</b><br>
Identifies as <b>Report Information 4 of 6</b><br>
<i>'Hear all Tosis! It is with great regret that we inform you of our Queen Neh`Ashiir's disappearance. Our best scouts have begun searching the surrounding countries for her trail. The Lord Rak`Ashiir also authorized the hire of mercenaries to venture into the Froglok Territories to search for traces of the Queen. All interested parties should report to the royal Quartermaster's office. Fear not citizens, our Queen will be found. Wisdom guide us'</i>
<br><br>
<b>Priest's Diary Page</b><br>
Identifies as <b>Report Information 5 of 6</b><br>
<i>'Well it appears our Lord Rak`Ashiir in his "wisdom" has cut our church's donation yet again. He claims it is to bolster the ranks of our garrison as many were wipe out during the Froglok incursions. However, I see more and more soldiers everyday, more that I ever have. And they are all equipped in the best armors the city's smiths can craft. This along with the recent replacement of our Bishop Screks with that coin grubber Biliaz leads me to suspect our King is planning on all but destroying our church entirely. I don't understand it, perhaps his missing Queen has driven him mad'</i>
<br><br>
<b>Student's Log</b><br>
Identifies as <b>Report Information 6 of 6</b><br>
<i>'Missed mass again today. This is the third time this week now. It is a worthy sacrifice however as I was able to attend the Master's National Coin exchange class. Perhaps the clergy will change the time of their masses, then I'll be able to attend regulary. Although with the appointment of the new Arch Priest it appears mass may be discontinued altogether. I honestly hope so. I could attend many more classes as well as spend more time rubbing elbows with merchants at the bazaars. I think I'll have to miss tomorrow's mass as well. I heard the Laughing Leech Guild is taking members again'</i>
<br><br>
<b>19.</b> Once you obtain all 6 reports, place them all in the Booklet and hit the combine button.  You will create a new item called <b>Combined Booklet</b>.
<br><br>
<b>20.</b> Return to Emerald Jungle and look for the <b>Spirit Sentinel</b> once again.  Give him the Combined Booklet.  He will then explain that you must go back to the City of Mist, kill <b>Lord Ghiosk</b> and loot the three books he is carrying around.
<br><br>
<b>21.</b> Go back to the City of Mist and look for Lord Ghiosk.  He has a placeholder, a <b>Black Reaver</b>.  Killing the Black Reaver will trigger Lord Ghiosk's spawn at that same spot.  Once Lord Ghiosk spawns, kill him and loot <b>Book 1</b>, <b>Book 2</b>, and <b>Book 3</b> he was carrying.
<br><br>
<b>22.</b> Return once more to Emerald Jungle and look for another <b>Spirit Sentinel</b> at loc +3685 -640.  Give the 3 Books to this Spirit and he will say the following: <i>'Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as random as we thought. It also looks as if this High Scale were having some sort of affair with Neh. We have little but speculation at this point, so making it known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing. Perhaps finding the resting place of the High Scale will show us more of what really happened. We suspect the icon mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's old temple. Find the icon and bring it to Kirn, wherever he is. Tell us what you learn afterwards'</i>.
<br><br>
<b>23.</b> You must now obtain a <b>High Scale Icon</b> in the City of Mist.  So go back there.  After entering the city and crossing the gate past the bridge, turn right.  Keep going straight and cross the first and second arches.  You will see a room with a waterfall running down its side.  Clear the area and then go to the first door you see at the base of the temple.
<br><br>
<b>24.</b> You will now see another door in front of you and 3 Skeletons to your right.  Clear the area and go to the room to your right.  You should now see a room below ground with three Phantoms in it.  Clear the area.
<br><br>
<b>25.</b> You should now see a door to your right and to your left.  Take the left door and you will enter an empty room with a small bag in the left corner.  Pick it up, that is the <b>High Scale Icon</b> you are looking for.
<br><br>
<b>26.</b> Once you obtain the High Scale Icon, you must take it to <b>High Scale Kirn</b> in The Hole.  Getting to High Scale Kirn is tricky and you will need the help of 3 to 4 groups.  Kirn is located in the Upper Tower, past the Elemental City.  Give the High Scale Icon to Kirn and he will say the following: <i>'Why did you bring me this? Are you here to accuse me of the queen's death?' High Scale Kirn chuckles venomously and continues, 'I am High Scale and beyond your petty laws. However, I wish the truth to be known. On my hand is a ring. If you can take it from me, show it to the queen and she will remember. However, I will not give up the ring easily. Defend yourself!'</i>
<br><br>
<b>27.</b> Kirn will then attack you.  Kill him and loot the <b>Engraved Ring</b> he drops.  The Ring identifies as the <b>Promise Ring of Neh'Ashiir and has the following stats:
<br><br>
<b>Engraved Ring</b><br>
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>
CHA+5<br>
WT 0.2<br>
Class: ALL<br>
Race: ALL</b>
<br><br>
<b>28.</b> Return to the City of Mist and look for <b>Neh'Ashiir</b>.  Give him the Engraved Ring and he will say the following: <i>'Nothing is left to hide now. You shall have the truth. But truth is not won easily and if you cannot defeat me, you have not the ability to see that vengeance is served. Brace yourself!'</i>
<br><br>
<b>29.</b> Neh'Ashiir will then attack you.  Kill him and loot his diary, <b>Neh'Ashiir's Diary</b>.
<br><br>
<b>30.</b> Go back to Emerald Jungle once again and look for the Spirit Sentinel you last spoke with, at loc +3685 -640.  Give him Neh'Ashiir's Diary and he will say the following: <i>'So, the truth is found! Rak mourned over the loss of his child instead of relishing the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect of what caused the king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the key! If we put the child to rest, Rak may repent of what he has done and the mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to Rak. I can feel the mantle's foundation crumbling! Now, go!'</i>
<br><br>
<b>31.</b> You must now venture into the Plane of Fear.  Once there, head to a small pyramid at loc -630 -360 and look for the <b>Iksar Child</b>.  Her spawn time is quite short, 1 minute, and she is only level 12 so you won't have any problems killing her.  Kill her and loot the <b>Iksar Child's Tear</b>.
<br><br>
<b>32.</b> Return to the City of Mist and give the Iksar Child's Tear to <b>Lord Rak'Ashiir</b>.  Follow the conversation prompts and Lord Rak'Ashiir will finally say the following: <i>'A test? How could it be a test? What was he testing? If he were to approach me as a saint what would be my first lesson of spirituality? What was he looking for in me?'</i>
<br><br>
<b>33.</b> Tell him 'He was looking for trust' and he shall give you a <b>Scale</b>.
<br><br>
<b>34.</b> Return one last time to Emerald Jungle and look for the Spirit Sentinel at loc +3685 -640.  Give him the Scale that Lord Rak'Ashiir gave you and the conversation that takes place is transcribed below:
<br><br>
<i>'What is this? The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak has repented his mistake? But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he was the one who initiated its construction. But is its initiation the key? How could we have been so blind? Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands but that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would lead them to destruction. It was the people who chose to follow'</i>
<br><br>
Say 'What is lost?'
<br>
<i>'The mantle was the product of thousands of faithless individuals. Not the single shroud we believed existed. Torsis is now truly cursed for all eternity as a great stain upon the universe. Today is a sad day, indeed. However, some good can still come of this. Your sacrifice and spiritual devotion in this matter have become legendary. You have waited for us at the bottom of the ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty rogue spirit. You have endured the black hole of Torsis and entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child from eternal suffering. It is only fitting that we reward you with our greatest treasure, the [Spear of Fate]'</i>
<br><br>
Say 'What Spear of Fate?'
<br>
<i>'The spear was constructed millennia ago by Thalger, the first human Heyokah. One of the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he is known, had been traveling the world searching out all known magic. Wherever he went, he discovered and experimented with all forms of dangerous magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of negative spiritual energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed into existence one of these [black holes]'</i>
<br><br>
Say 'What black holes?'
<br>
<i>'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to experiment in solitude. It was here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately for the small tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this new black hole threatened not only their livelihood but their entire existence. The mantle was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything within its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The tribes were threatened with complete annihilation. But one [powerful shaman] stepped forward and struck against Miragul's mantle'</i>
<br><br>
Say 'What powerful shaman?'
<br>
<i>'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed to construct a weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the [cosmos]. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned entrails of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an aviak elder'</i>
<br><br>
Say 'What cosmos?'
<br>
<i>'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought into existence. This force was positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. Even though it worked like a void, it was still created by an imposition of will. We figured that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get close to it. In one act of devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a [breach] across the planes'</i>
<br><br>
Say 'What of the breach?'
<br>
<i>'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough negative material to cancel out Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so perfect that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself was lost in the process. All that was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to have it. When you strike with it, you must have the same singularity of purpose as did Thalger when he defeated Miragul's mantle. Thank you, Heyokah'</i>
