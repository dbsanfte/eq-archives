<p> Should you decide that joining our Circle is what you truly wish, and what is in your heart, there are steps you must take.  The first being you must hunt with members , and begin your trials. </p><br>
  <p>The Circle will discuss and vote upon your trial, if you have been found worthy,
  and your ideals, goals and behavior consistent with those qualities most
  honored by the Circle, then you will be given a quest. The details of the
  quest are told to you privately, along with any specifics and conditions of
  its completion. Quests are NEVER meant to cause your death and anything asked
  of you has already been done successfully by one of our members at the same
  circle you currently hold.</p><br>

  <p>Upon completion of your quest, there will be a vote of the Circle and if that
  vote is in your favor you will then wear the tag of RONIN!!</p><br>

  <p>The Circle is very much a part of the role-play aspect of Norrath, special
  ceremonies for new members are a big part of our enjoyment with the realm. 
  You may find yourself called upon to tell of your quest, or should you perform
  some service to another adventurer that caused them to seek out an officer and
  commend you, tell of the battle that caused that commendation. Therefore, the
  ability to roleplay is part of our judgement of your suitability for the
  Circle.</p><br>

  <p>The Circle is building an excellent reputation within the realm. Any
  infraction of the ROC or the Circle charter may result in removal of Ronin Tag,
  will be done on a case by case basis and the Circle will vote on the removal.</p><br></center>
