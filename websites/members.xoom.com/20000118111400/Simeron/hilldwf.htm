are mostly underground with a castle or walled settlement above that. Hill
dwarves are normally four feet tall and about 150 stones in wieght. Their
build is stocky and muscular with skin of dark tan to light brown. normal
hair colors are brown, black and grey. They prefer earth tones in clothing
and wear little jewelry at all. Hill dwarves are the main type of dwarves
