dwarves have gone deep into the earth and rarely ever come to the surface.
No one knows the exact reason why they chose to do this but, there are
many ideas. Curiosity, protection from monsters or a cataclysm or some
other such thing has been pondered. They are four to four and a half feet
tall and weight 120 stones. Their build is slighter than their cousins
and hair color runs from firey red to corn yellow. Their skin is pale brown
to light tan in color, normally with a reddish tint to it.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
