<p align="left">I must apologize for not having updated sooner.  RL has kept me away and quite busy.  There have been more pictures added to the images page, so do enjoy them.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">The roster and the skills pages have been updated to reflect a few changes within the family.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">I have added a section on skills.  Those that are in our Circle and have a certain skill have been listed, and there are links to pages that will give information on that skill.  This is be no means complete, though, so do bear that in mind.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">Tunare has blessed us again, though this time, in a slightly different way.  We have some new friends, and allies.  Cold Comfort and CoR have officially become allies.  I know that this union will prove a blessed and fruitful one.  Tunare be praised!</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">I am so pleased to announce another new member.  A very dear friend of mine has joined our family.  Kyline, you are very welcome.  May we never fail you.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">There have been a couple additions to the pages that I'd like to tell you about.  A bio has been added for our dear friend Teeo, and we have our first story up on the tales page.  Thanks go to Palehorse for this.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">And again, we grow!  Tunare has truly blessed us. I would like to welcome Klinsman Sivaks into the family.  Also, Innoruuk has made Himself known, and we now have enemies.  May they ne'er cross us too badly.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">Once again, our circle has grown.  I would like to welcome Rayyn into the family.  Also, there have been some additions to the images page.  We do like to have our fun!</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">I would like to welcome two new members, again!  We're growing by leaps and bounds.  Thorgan, and Fyyre, you are well met, and we're happy to have you join our family.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">I would like to welcome two new members, but old friends into our Circle.  Addy, and Sumar, you are well met, and it's good to have you with us.  Tunare has truely blessed us this day. *smiles happily*</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">Today is the day that we will be submitted for all the world to see.  We have already grown in number from that which we started out with, and our influence is spreading further.  The roster has been updated to indicate race/class and secondary characters.  There have also been a couple images added, and the bio's for Kaabob and Shadowfyre are now up.  Enjoy.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left"> We have finally made it to the web with our site.  *cheers at being  global*  This is a great day, as now we can spread our influence over all the lands.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="rule07.gif" width="468" height="22"></p>
<p align="left">On this day, September 21st, in the year of our Lords and Ladies Nineteen Hundred and Ninety-Nine, the Circle of Ronin was formed.  We have banded together, and are proclaiming our presence in the realm of Norrath!</p>
