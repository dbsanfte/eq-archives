<TR>
<TD WIDTH="7%">Levels 1-3</TD>

<TD>I would just Stay in your Newbie area, really not to much to say here.
I prefered hunting Skells in Gnomeland as they sometimes carry weapons
( which are almost always a gold and change). Orcs are also good as they
carry cloth armour and weapons. Also as soon as you can get a bag or some
such to carry loot in ( you can carry more).</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Levels 4-7</TD>

<TD>As you get your First Pet you will find hunting blues to be easy, almost
too easy...hammer um&nbsp; let the pet do the work ( watch his health)
and pick up the loot..I tired to stick with the same monster ( so loot
would stack). You can also try a Even Con now. Remeber till you reach 5
there is no penalty for Dying...so take some tough stuff on . it is also
"maybe" worth while to die right before you reach 5th level to resupply
your food. Once you make 5 + you can start looking for Groups, depending
on where you are ( most races have a close place to hunt something a little
meaner). I personally prefered to solo up to about 8, then start looking
for Groups.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Levels 8-11</TD>

<TD>OK now you are getting some where..If you are in area CrushBone si
a good place to group. I have heard Misty Thicket is also great ( i have
no info as i wasnt there till i was much higher). At these levels grouping
is more imporant..but if you are like me...SOLO..i love it ( and still
do) But you will miss alot of what is fun about EQ...talking and grouping...Getting
yourself into a group that plays at the same time..and playes together
WILL make EQ much more enjoyable..but this isnt so easy. Most Starting
Cities have a good place to hunt for thses levels...But again..i have Heard
Crushbone And Misty are both great.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Levels 12-15</TD>

<TD>When i reached 13 i went the Karanas and hunted ( again SOLO) Carrion
Spiders and Snakes(crag snakes if i remeber) and in E. Karanas there is
a gnoll Spawn that spawns Reavers during the day, and Undead Reavers at
night ( the UNDEAD are roughly 2-4 levels above there daytime friends).
The best thing to do in this area is camp close to water, ( remeber way
back to bridge to zone) and have somebody pull..The puller should be ready
to run for ZONE as it is very easy to grab several instead of 1 or 2 like
you would like. If you have a large group you may be ok with whatever you
pull..if its smaller..remember good comunications from the puller can save
lives.The exp in this area is GOOD, but the loot is poor ( for the spiders
and the snakes) but the Gnolls are pretty good, some bronze weapons, some
good armour, and so on.PLEASE send me more info on good hunting Spots.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Levels 16-19</TD>

<TD>I stayed in E Karanas for msot of these levels at the Gnolls spawn
as i could solo ( if i was carefull) and i had a Partner we could take
a few at once. We also killed Broon ( named Cyclops ) in the area...but
if you chose to do this..remeber his big brother will come almost right
after you kill him..so run to bridge after you loot...with the 2 of us
we could ned up after a battle and he would be back about when we were
done. When i was alone i went to the ScareCrow fields ( north Karanas i
think) which was good for soloing and the Scarecrows give Words pretty
regular.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Levels 20-24</TD>

<TD>Ihave been hunting at the cenatuar village since i got to 20 ( again
SOLO) the foals should be ok for you at 20, then come the Shelties, and
then Archers...Stay away from the Coursers, and Chargers...AND ( READ)
they help each other..so make sure you catch um alone with none in range.There
is no faction hits whatsoever for killing them. and there VIllage has a
seller to buy your loot..no long run to sell. There is also a AVIAK village
in the same zone that is a great place to group, with good loot and EXP.</TD>
</TR>

<TD><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/"><IMG SRC="new_blk.gif" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=64></A>
<BR>Level 24-27</TD>

<TD>&nbsp;I have been hunting Broon and Crag Spiders in the East Karanas,
the loot is ok and the EXP is excellent. This is for the solo mage with
a pet. I have found i can kill 2 and sometimes 3 Crag spiders in one med.
Be carefull when hunting Broon as his big brother comes about 10 seconds
after you have killed him..so dont be there, AND HE HAS A HIGH AGGRESION
area, so loot and just keep moving to the bridge.</TD>

I have seen the 24th level Cornucopia for sale at the Mage Guild in Qeynos.
I didnt get a chance to look
<BR>for other spells but plan to soon.

<P>Pets for 16th and 20th Level: There is a vendor in the OOT. Go to the
sisters island, as you get off boat, follow
<BR>the shore to the left, you should see a small boat, you can pilot this
boat. there is a island in the dir the boat travels from
<BR>the island.&nbsp; you can just see it from the edge where the boat
is...Be carefull there is a Ogre on the island. The Castle has
<BR>a vendor.

<P>Remeber to examine your pets at lower levels, they get expensive in
the higher levels, learn there strengths and weaknesses.

<P>When you get Specialize, be carefull, plan wht you want as your main
one, once on of them reaches 50 the others will only
<BR>get to 50 and the first one to reach it will increase farther. This
is a tough area for us, as Verant says we are the Kings of
<BR>making stuff , well that is nice..but you really dont need speed, or
less mana use in this area...Combat is where you want
<BR>to be fast and mana efficeant. SO make your pcik wisely.

<P>When you are sitting waiting for a boat or for your Party to group,
practice something. Scense Heading, if water is close
<BR>swim a bit. If you need some of thse skills later, and have to build
um all quick you will be glad you did it when you were
<BR>not doing anything else.

<P>Bind Infinity, when you get this spell you are going to Fizzle alot
( and that is an understatment). SInce it uses Alteration as a skill
<BR>when you are bored, use your Gate spell, i have also heard identify
( useless spell, may not be in game at all) uses it too.

<U><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00"><FONT SIZE=+2>WORDS needed by a Magician</FONT></FONT></U>

<P>This is a list of words that a mage can use for research. I have no
idea if this is a complete list, as far as i know from looking
<BR>at Mage spell sites this is a pretty good list. I made this so you
know which words to hang onto and which to discard.
<BR>This is by no means "FOR SURE". and remeber Verant says there are other
Spells out there, (who knows).

<P>Words of Tyranny (16th level pet summoning), Words of the Element (16th
Summon Heatstone), Words of Dominion (20th Level Pets)
<BR>Words of Trancendence (24th food and water spell), Words of Dimension
(24th level Pet spell), Words of Sight (29th Coldstone),
<BR>Words of Coercion (29th pet spells), Words of Detention (34th Cancel
magic), Words of Duress (34th Pet Spell),
<BR>Words of Collection (39th Summon Dagger), Words of Convocation (39th
Pet Spell), Words of Incarceration (44th Pet Spell),
<BR>Words of Bondage (49th pet spell).
