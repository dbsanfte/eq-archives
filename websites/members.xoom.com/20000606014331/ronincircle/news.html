<p align="left">A new era is dawning for the Circle.  We will soon no longer be known as the Circle of Ronin.  But do not despair, for we will still be around, just under a new name.  We are being accepted into the fold of the Sacred Order of Shadows.  Within the next few days this transition will be complete.  Than, look for us with our new family at our <a href="http://www.shadows.to">new home.</a><font size="3" font color="yellow">11 Apr 00 ~Ialani </font></p>
