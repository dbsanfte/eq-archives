<P><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold">Vergadain is the dwarven god of
luck and wealth. He is the trickster god, the schemer, and the rogue, and
is greatly venerated by those who get through life by their wits. Clergy
of Vergadain are normally on good terms with priests of Abbathor (at least
the best terms of all the other dwarven gods) and have a similar set of
powers although how you use them is different. While Abbathor worshippers
strive to gain wealth through the darker side of life, Vergadain encourages
his worshippers to live to the fullest extent of their means. Temples of
Vergadain are lavishly decorated, ornate in opulance and always in search
of new sources of wealth. Dwarven merchants, shop owners, business people
and almost anyone in any trade where the buying and selling of items is
done can be found in his followers. Vergadain stops short of endorsing
thievery from dwarves (although other races are fair game), but his clergy
and worshippers do their utmost to wind up on the top of every deal (including
some ways that could be considered unethical).</FONT>
