<P><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold">&nbsp;Fortubo is worshipped in
small communities of dwarves that live on the edge of the two main areas
of habitation. These communities live niether above ground or below ground
all the time but in both areas off and on. Fortubo's temples are always
of stone construction with metal bars placed in the stone for added strength.
He is a close ally of Moradin, Berronar and Dumathoin. He has found these
dwarven gods to be much more to his liking than the others. His main worshippers
are mostly metalsmiths and miners (to a lesser extent). Fortubo demands
a rigorous respect for all peoples of his priests, and they are sworn to
never take life without cause. He will defrock any clergy who knowingly
commits an evil act, though he will spare them their life. Fortubo's clergy
are expected to act as spiritual guides to their peoples and to lift arms
only when the actions of the more evil races demand it.</FONT>
