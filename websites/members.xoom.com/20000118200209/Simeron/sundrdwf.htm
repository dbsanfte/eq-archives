<P><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Unlike
most dwarves, sundered dwarves live totally above ground. They once were
hill or mountain dwarves but, something cut them off from thier traditional
way of life. This could be natural like a volcano or earthquake or supernatural
like a gateway to a hellish plane being opened. Whatever the reason, they
have abandoned the subterrainean way of life. Communities of sundered dwarves
are mostly found along side human and elven towns where they still practice
their smithing and mining skills. They are four and a half to five feet
tall, making them the tallest of the dwarves, and weigh about 155 stones.
Their skin is light brown to pink in color and hair is normally black with
blue tinges.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
