<P><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold">Clergy of Muamman are unique among
the dwarven gods in that they do not build a permanent structure for their
services but instead have a portable tent-like one they can move with them.
The main worshippers of Muamman are sundered dwarves, dwarven adventurers
and those dwarves who move among strange and alien peoples as opposed to
the remaining within the safety of their halls. Clergy can never own anything
they cannot carry with them nor can they "settle" in any one spot for longer
than one winter's cycle (1 year). After that time, another member of the
clergy must take up residence or the community left with but a small leanto
shrine. Muamman is probably the most neutral of all the dwarven gods but,
he does tend to side with good more than evil.</FONT>
