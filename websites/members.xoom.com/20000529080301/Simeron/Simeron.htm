<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33">This is me
history and who I am. I was born to a noble family in the Misty Mountain
Clan. Me father, Fulgar Ironhouse, was a powerful trader within the clan.
He regularly took me mother, meself and me younger brother into the trading
village near our caverns. We would pack up metal ingots, weapons, armor
and crafts from our shops to sell at the town and then buy furs, scented
oils, feathers and various foodstuffs from the town for resale once we
got home. I was apprenticed to a weapon smith for several winters so that
I would have a better knowledge about metals and weapons and to get accustomed
to humans and their ways. However, trading is in me blood and Dad made
quite a bit of gold at it so, I returned to him fairly quick. He taught
me the value of knowing how to read a person. I'm not as good as me father
at it but, I'm a good trader now too. I think the greatest thing me father
taught me was how to read and write in both dwarven and human. It helps
ever so much when reading contracts.</font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33">Early on,
I knew me life's path was pretty much mapped out for me. Clan tradition
said that I must join the army once me beard touched me chest. This came
to pass in me thirty-second winter. A bit young to be sure but, I grew
fast. Thus, I left home to become a dwarven infantryman in King Wintergreen's
army. However, as fate would have it, I was directed by the Longbeard to
a new branch of service, the mounted scouts. Here, I learned many a hard
lesson, and I got the scars to prove it. If anyone ever tells you that
mountain goats are easy to ride, tell them I said they're a liar. Goliath,
my goat, was as temperamental as they come but, I was just a bit more stubborn
than he was so, we have come to a mutual understanding. I ride his back
and he gets fed at least twice a day. After I completed me training, I
was then entered into the advanced courses where I learned mounted as well
as ground combat, studied stone fortifications and the rocks themselves
so that I would be a better scout, how to set snares for food and defense
and the best ways to tie and untie ropes on people and things. Me father
had a special graduation gift for me when I finished me training, DwarGlum,
the Vermin Bane. A rune covered dwarven hammer of exquisite make and fantastic
power. It is because of this that I dedicated me life to learning the dwarven
hammer better than anyone else. I use DwarGlum in preference to my battle
axe or crossbow whenever I can and am quite deadly with it when I need
to be.</font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33">Me holy life
is simple. I pray to both Mordain and Clangeddin every day for wisdom&nbsp;
in life and guidance in battle. I follow the Dwarven Way and live by a
code few can follow. I believe that how someone lives is just as important
as how someone dies. I also don't believe in wasting resources or lives
in any case. Through good tactics and training, both will last long and
through many fights. I have a very strong hatred of ogres and take great
pleasure in knee capping and nut cracking them with me hammer. Nothing
is as funny to me as seeing one of them lumbering hulks trying to hold
his groin and run with two busted knees.</font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33">I have traveled
far from my home now and seen many worlds. Some were beautiful while others
left much to be desired. It was in those travels that I came across a fellow
dwarf named NemesisKnight. He took me to his small, but growing clan and
introduced me to Dergan the Foe hammer, chieftain of the clan of Odin's
Hammer. After a brief discussion and alot of fine dwarven ale, I decided
to settle in with them for a few weeks before moving on in me journey.
That "few weeks" became many a winter and I came to command me own warband
within the clan itself and sit on the Council of Elders. We have since
set out on our own as is the Way of Odin's Hammer Clan. I have molded and
shaped me warriors into the best fighting force any army could ever want
for. Know that when we take the field, evil will tremble with fear at our
approach and die by our hands. A greater friend you cannot have nor a worse
enemy find. We are the best of the best, slayers without equal. We are
the Mithril Warhammers.</font></font>
