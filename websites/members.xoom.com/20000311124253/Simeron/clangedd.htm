<P><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><FONT COLOR="#000000">As the Father
of Battle, Clangeddin is the resolute dwarven war god in the eternal struggles
with the other races. HIs worshippers are mainly warriors but, in time
of war, all the dwarven nation turns to him. His priests fight as well
as warriors and many a high priest leads a dwarven army as its general.
Clangeddin teaches that a battle must be just and a triumph obtained through
valor or nothing is gained. Cowardice or Stupidity in battle (strategic
withdrawls are allowed) is punished by the loss of all granted powers until
the offender atones by defeating a feared enemy, the quest must be performed
by the dwarf alone, with no assistance other than his own arms and armor.</FONT></FONT>
