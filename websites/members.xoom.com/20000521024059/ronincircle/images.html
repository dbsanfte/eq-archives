<p>Many of us have seen wonderous things on our journies, and we wanted to share them with the world.  Or, for those that have seen them, remind them of what a great, and vast realm Tunare has blessed us with. </p><br>
<center><font color=white font face="Tolkien" font size="5" font align="center">
<p>When did <a href="firebeetle.gif">they</a> learn levitate?</p><br>
<p>Stopping for a rest, I watched in awe as the <a href="treant.gif">Treants</a> worshipped the moon at it's peak.</p><br>
<p>It's moments like <a href="UniRun.gif">this</a> that make Kaabob proud to be a ranger.</p><br>
<p>Kaabob came upon <a href="dragonbones.gif">these bones</a> before he joined us.  It's a good thing he found them in such condition otherwise he might have been in a spot of trouble.</p><br>
<p>A <a href="Permaphoto1.gif">family</a> photo, the first of many. Addy, Gurl, Celestialsinger, Jazu, Kaabob, and Merise.  Thanks, Kaabob!</p><br>
<p>There was anther group in Permafrost that night, and they were in the thick of battle with a <a href="Diplomat.gif">diplomat</a>.</p><br>
<p>A group of hag's decided to take a stab, and were greatly <a href="HagNap.gif">rewarded</a> for their effort. They suffered more than we.</p><br>
<p>We are such a photogenic family, I had to take a few more and add them.  Hope you enjoy these. <a href="family1.gif">With me.</a>  This <a href="family2.gif">one</a> I took, along with this <a href="family3.gif">one</a>.</p><br>
<p>And just in case you thought all we did was party, here's <a href="Gurl.gif">proof</a> to the contrary.  We even had him on the <a href="Proon.gif">run</a> for a bit.</p><br>
<p>On a recent trip to Qeynos I came across a couple very interesting sites.  The <a href="clocktower.gif">Clock</a> they have is a work of art, but <a href="spaceship1.gif">this one</a>  I just couldn't figure out, so I took <a href="spaceship2.gif">another shot.</a>  Seems there are aliens even here, in Norrath.</p><br>
<p>Just the other day I had the pleasure of hunting with Kaabob and Celestialsinger, which doesn't happen often, so I took full advantage of it.  Not only did I get to see them <a href="theboys.gif">in action</a>, but I got a good shot of <a href="inaction.gif">myself</a> with my bow, and was even able to meet the <a href="hightreant.gif">High Treant.</a>  (Yup, that little one on the left is Kaabob.)  Many thanks to Kaabob for introducing us.</p><br>
<p>While fighting in Lake Rathe, I had the opportunity to make a <a href="Ebaemnn.gif">new friend</a>, kill a few birds, and smell a few things I'd rather not have.  The only thing worse than a roasting <a href="roastingbird.gif">Aviak,</a> is a roasting <a href="roastedtroll.gif">troll.</a></p><br>
<p>And what are friends for if not to help you with a Ghoul Messenger?  Kaabob and I went out one day to rid this creature of his map, and though the <a href="duringghoul1.gif">battle</a> was <a href="duringghoul2.gif">fierce</a>, the <a href="ghoulvictory.gif">victory</a> was sweet.  Than came the necessary <a href="afterghoul1.gif">healing</a>.</p><br>
