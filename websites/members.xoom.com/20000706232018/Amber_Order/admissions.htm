	<P><B>1)</B> The period during which members are &quot;Initiates&quot; will serve as an evaluation period of the
	potential scholar. This means all scholars and above should make every attempt to interact with the initiate and
	get to <BR>
	know him/her as much as possible.<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>2)</B> The normal initiation period will be 14 three hour play sessions or two weeks, whichever is greater.<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>3)</B> When the initiation period has passed, initiates who show the characteristics desired by the Amber Order
	will be admitted.<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>4)</B> If any member of the Amber Order has some reason to doubt an initiate, they should report this to the
	officers via email. Depending on the severity of this report, the initiate will either be immediately disbanded
	or will be required to undergo an additional initiation period during which the officers will more carefully scrutinize
	the initiate.<BR>
	<BR>
	<B>5)</B> If at any point during this process an officer has due reason to doubt the behavior of one of these initiates,
	they can disband the initiate from the guild at that point.</P>
