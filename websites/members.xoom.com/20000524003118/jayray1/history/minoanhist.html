      years of Greek rule the Minoan people revolted.&nbsp; The rebels invaded the courtyard of
      the palace of Knossos.&nbsp; Fire began to eat in to the wooden columns which supported
      the upper chambers.&nbsp; Salvation could only come from the intervention of the gods.
      &nbsp; Wearing the ceremonial robes of the predisposed Minoan monarchs, the foreign king
      prepared for the sacred ceremony.&nbsp; By the fountain in the throne room the holy water
      was made ready, to wash away their sins and cause divine favor to fall once again upon the
      king.&nbsp; The king never reached the water of expiation.&nbsp; The beams supporting the
      ceiling columns crumbled.&nbsp; With a roar, the ceiling and the upper floors fell in,
      burying everything in layers of rubble.&nbsp; It was the late spring of a year around 1200
      BC.</small></font></p>

      necessary to the making of bronze began to be the most prized merchandise available, from
      Egypt to Greece and from Italy to Mesopotamia.&nbsp; Due to Crete's numerous ships sailing
      throughout the Mediterranean packed with oil, grain, wine, and other Cretan goods which
      were then traded for loads of tin and copper the Minoan's found themselves making huge

      <p align="left"><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light" color="#800000"><small>The Minoans
      did not build grand temples and altars to glorify and worship their gods.&nbsp; The Minoan
      religion was very simple, the people worshipped the natural phenomena that they saw all
      around them and which manifested themselves in a wide variety of ways.&nbsp; For example
      the bull, an emblem of Minoan civilization, was venerated as a symbol of strength and
      fertility.&nbsp; Whenever there was a religious holiday, the Minoans would flock to the
      courtyard in front of the palace of Knossos where a sacrifice to the gods would be made.
      &nbsp; Once this offering had been made and the sacrificial rites were ended the games
      would begin.&nbsp; Such games spread to Greece and later became the model for the
      Olympics.&nbsp; The Minoans loved races, boxing, wrestling and unarmed combat, but there
      was one particular sport that they loved above all: bull jumping.&nbsp; Young men would
      mount the backs of angry bulls and attempt to do acrobatic feats on the bull.&nbsp; When
      the acrobat had finished his display, the bull would put his head down and charge. &nbsp;
      That is when young men and women of the crowd would attempt to jump over the bull's
      back&nbsp; as it charged.&nbsp; They would then attempt to pull the bull to the ground
      where it was killed.</small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light" color="#800000"><small>Crete was at
      the height of its power around 2000 BC.&nbsp; During the four centuries before that Crete
      had consolidated marine supremacy and was trading all around the Mediterranean Sea. &nbsp;
      However, the island of Crete was beset by a number of catastrophes.&nbsp; Around 1700 BC
      an earthquake seems to have destroyed the royal palaces (although it may have been an
      invasion from the Achaeans from the Greek mainland that was responsible).&nbsp; Around
      1600 BC another catastrophe or series of catastrophes occurred.&nbsp; Some of the damage
      may have been done by the volcanic eruptions on the island of Thera which virtually
      exploded and may have caused a tidal wave of such dimensions that many palaces were
      destroyed and never rebuilt.&nbsp; Also around this time the Minoans may not have been
      able to withstand the marauding Greeks.&nbsp; Another catastrophe ended the Greek
      presence, but the distinctive Minoan culture would never recover.&nbsp; The future lay
      with the Greeks on the mainland. </small></font></p>
