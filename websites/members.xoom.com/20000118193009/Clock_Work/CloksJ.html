<TD>I start this journal not as a young mage, but afollower of the 5th
circle of spells. I hope to jot down the details of my experience as a
young mage.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-3</TD>

<TD>I started my travels outside my hometown Ak'Anon home of the gnomes
( the soon to be rules of land). I woke with my master gone and a note
to give to my guild master ( who i had never met) and two scrolls, a book
which i have yet to look at. I have placed the book in the bank for later
use. I have talked to several other new adventures and they have said the
book contains advice on fighting with my own brethren, and the other races
in our world. I have found the book somehow returns to me if i die, and
it has to be replaced in the bank. After several fights i should have know
better to engage in and replacing the book in the bank i have decided to
keep it on my person for now. The first thing i did was&nbsp; sit down
and look at my scrolls i had, since i knew they had to be scribed into
my spell book i did that.&nbsp;
<BR>I noticed as i scribed the spells to my book that the words i wrote
disappeared off the scrolls as i wrote them. the spells were:&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Burst of Flame- </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">It
seemed when i cast this spell when i had a monster targeted it ignited
the air around it. I found this spell worked well on the first monsters
i encountered. The range was enough i could target and pull back to a safe
distance and fight at my convince. I did find the spell would attract any
monster close to the one i had targeted, mayhaps the grunt from the targeted
called its brethren to help it.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Minor Shielding-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">When</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">i first cast this spell i felt more life in
myself, and i noticed monsters seemed to have a tougher time hitting me.
As i this seemed to help me in battle, i kept this spell active at all
times.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF99">After I left my home city i took the pass to the
left straight out my home towns tunnel. I found a stone monument with a
Human female ( at least this is what i have been told by others, terrible
looking thing, so tall its a wonder they dont tip over when they are hit)
i found she would by my loot&nbsp; which saved me considerable time going
back to my hometown to sell. I attacked Rats and Gnome skeletons, making
sure i healed and rested so my manna was full. Soon i felt i had reached
a new level, my health seemed to increase. I noticed that sometimes the
skells had weapons, these i attacked with vigor after finding most of these
weapons gave me a gold back from&nbsp; shops. I soon came upon a skell
with a great staff, after i had killed it i held the staff in my hands,
it felt good, and after being hit with it i thought i would try it. I soon
learned it did some great damage but was very slow, still i felt after
growing stronger i could take more damage so i had the time it took to
deal out damage with this staff. I noticed as i used it my skill moved
very slowly, i decided when i trained with my guild master i would put
some points in 2 hand blunt, and after this my skill with it seemed to
increase faster, I believe that the initial learning curve of any level
is best to train a few points with your guild master in a skill , it "seemed"
to raise quicker , this is my belief, others may tell you not to as your
skill will go up no matter what with use, i leave this up to you. I soon
saw a skell with another staff, one i had not seen before, so i attacked
and looted the corpse. A cracked staff, i noticed i could hold it in one
hand, and that it was considerably faster then the huge two handed staff,
but now i needed to learn how best to use it. After using it awhile i decided
i would switch off weapons , 2 handed staff, 1 handed staff, and my dagger,
so that my skill would be equal with all.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFF99">Something just seemed to go off in my head when
i got better, so i knew when yo switch off when i felt i had learned all
i could for awhile. I stayed away from the rats that seemed to be green
colored as they seemed to carry some nasty desiease. I continued to clobber
skells and rats till i reached 4th level. I bought a few spells from the
guild along the way.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Summon food-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC"> This
summoned me some black bread, i noticed i could trade it to others, but
the shop keepers wanted no part of it and would not buy it. After an extended
time away from adventuring&nbsp; i noticed when i came back and picked
up my adventuring pack that it was gone. It seems this is only good till
i sit and camp.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Summon Drink-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">This
summoned me some water which i could trade, but also no shop would buy.
It also seemed to disappear when i camped.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">SummonDagger-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">When
i first cast this spell and got a dagger after a death i knew how handy
it was..I need not walk back to my corpse unarmed anymore. I would always
have a weapon. I have also heard form other adventures that since i made
it from magic it can hit those creatures that are immune to normal weapons.This
i have yet to test as i am not daring enough to fight anything of that
level yet, besides i have seen nothing that a good rap on the skull with
a stick wont injure.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Flare-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I have not
bought this spell as i have been told by others it is just a pretty light.
They have said it is useful for people finding you, just shoot it and it
shoots a bright orange flare&nbsp; to pinpoint your location.This may or
may not prove useful, i myself found no use for it so i have not bought
it.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Reclaim Energy-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I
bought this spell and wondered what i would use it for, a fellow mage of&nbsp;
some considerable circle higher then me said if i had alot of food, or
a dagger i had summoned i could use this spell to suck the manna back into
my reserve. he also hinted i may use it on a friend i would soon be traveling
with, he said i could suck the manna out of him. I am wondering if i was
talking to a loony or what.. I hope to find out what he was talking about
soon.</FONT>&nbsp;

<TR>
<TD>Level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4-7</TD>

<TD>As i felt the surge i feel when i have made some progress i headed
back to the mage guild, as i got there i noticed i could use more spells.
I asked a fellow mage and he told me to get a pet. I thought this a rude
comment, but after examining the spells i could now use i seen what he
meant. I quickly bought a&nbsp; new spell.&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Elementalkin Fire-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I
knew from the excitement in other mages eyes as they bought this spell
that it must be something special. I quickly cast it. Hmmmm it didn't work,
it just seemed to be missing something, i asked around and was told i needed
a green stone called Malachite ( spelling?). I bought a few stones and
went to my old stomping grounds to see what this spell would do. I cast
it and heard a low rushing of air behind me and turned around. I jumped
back as there was a flaming molten fiend standing right beside me, i turned
and ran as quickly as i could, the beast followed. As i ran out of breath
and had to slow down i could almost feel its flaming fists slamming into
my back, i gave up running and turned to face the beast. It stopped and
stood by me. After much testing i learned it followed my commands. I had
it follow me and soon seen it would attack anything i wished. This was
the life, sit back and let my pet do the work. I soon learned if i helped
the pet with a BURST OF FLAME and also helped with a staff now and again
i could whittle monsters down&nbsp; much quicker. I also noticed my new
pet healed quit fast.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF99">My next spells where all bought soon after. I
also learned there were a total of 4 Pets you could get, i would suggest
to you to try them all now when the spells cost little, and pick a favorite.
I have noticed this about the pets:</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00">Fire--</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC"> It seems to
have a small amount of health, but i noticed every monster that strikes
it takes damage from its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flaming body.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#CCFFFF">Air--</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC"> This pet seems
to be harder for the monsters to hit, and seems to do average damage. It
also seems to disappear when not fighting.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Water--</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC"> This pet
seems to be about average at everything. It -seemed- to heal quicker then
the others, but i cant be sure of this.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#663300">Earth--</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">My favorite
pet, he seems to be slow so he gets hit alot, but this seems not to bother
him much as he seems to have alot of health. He also seems to hit much
harder then the other pets, so as long as i hammer along with him i can
take much harder monsters. I have also heard tell he is better at pulling
monsters off of me if i am there target, i cannot tell you if this is true,
but i hear him taunting the monsters alot whilst we fight.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Burn-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC"> This seemed
to work alot like Burst Of Flame but it did alot more damage.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Fire Flux-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC"> As i was
attacked by more then one monster at a time i learned this spell did damage
to al the monsters close to me. The damage wasn't great but it hit all
in its range.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Gate-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">This spell when
i cast the first time took me back to where i started. I figure this will
be good for getting out of tight situations. I did notice it takes awhile
to cast so one would need to be prepared to cast it for quick get aways.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Summon Bandages-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">This
spell summoned bandages to use with the Bind Wound skill, i used this skill
often when i felt i was under half of my health. It seemed to do little
but i was assured it would be a great help latter. I also heard that the
better i became as a mage the more bandages it would summon.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Sense Summond-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I have
heard this would point me to the nearest summoned creature felt i would
use this little in my adventuring so i did not buy this spell.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Summon Wisp- </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I cast
this spell and found i had a stone in my hands. It seemed to give off light.
I wondered what good it would do. Soon i was told not all of the inhabitants
of this world see as well as gnomes at night, i was told this could be
given to those who see poorly at night to aid them. I will find out one
day, but right now i useit not. I would imagine if you could not see well
at night this would be a handy spell.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF99">I noticed that with a pet i could fight tougher
monsters and i moved to some of the spiderlings in the area, they gave
silk as loot when the body was split. I found that spider silk was a profitable
seller. I also noticed alot of spiders from home, but i noticed they followed
no orders, and soon found they were rouge. I smashed a few, and soon found
they carried broken parts, gears and such, some i could sell, others i
could not. I felt they were a waste of time for me, i needed money to learn
new spells,and i got exp and loot from others. I soon noticed a 2 tents
a short distance from the rats and Skells. It was populated by Kobolds.
I tried the camp, as my spell hit the guard out front&nbsp; 2 more emerged
from the tents. THis was going badly, my pet was getting beat from all
sides and i didn't have the manna to take the Kobolds out fast enough.
After this fight i realized i would have to be careful and kill them one
at a time. I did notice they would sometimes venture off form the camp
where i could single them out. I also noticed there were Kobold Pups running
around which i could easily take out. the larger ones sometimes carried
a bag which was quite useful for storing my loot, and sometimes they carried
a drink. After awhile i decided to venture to another area.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFF99">I soon found another Kobold camp which was much
larger, and much more dangerous. I Found some help and we attacked the
camp with vigor, soon i was feeling stronger and stronger. I must warn
you the Pumas, and Regular Skells are much to powerful so unless they seem
to be an even match ( size them up) i would stay away. I also found that
the large Plague rats seemed to help the skells out if you attacked them.
I would recommend not to do this till later levels.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8-11</TD>

<TD>As i reached the third Circle of magic i quickly made my way to the
guild and bought spells.&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Flame Bolt-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC"> This
spell did good damage but unlike my other spells i found i must actually
aim it. Right when i tried this spell for the first time i thought it was
a manna hog, for the damage and it took a long time for me to feel i could
cast another. After a few tries i found i used this spell very little as
i could miss, others tell me it is quite effective, so i leave this to
you.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Lesser Shielding-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">This
spell made me feel stronger and more immune to attacks, it seemed to be
the same as MINOR SHIELDING but better. I found myself using it all the
time. I tried casting this on another but it only seems to work on me.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Shock of Blades-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">When
i first tried this spell on a Kobold i was amazed, the Kobold died before
i could let my pet hit him. I find this spell to be of great use, and have
noticed as i feel stronger it increases strength also.I use this spell
as my mainstay attack.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Shield of Fire-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I
find casting this on myself or my pet during a longer battle is a wise
thing to do. As i notice it seems to make anything that attacks you pay
for it buy being burned. this spell seems to last through combat, and then
fade away.&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Invisibility-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">This
spell is very useful as it makes whoever i cast it on fade away. I have
used this many times to travel areas i felt were much to dangerous before.
I have noticed that for me to cast it on another we have to be in a party.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I have also heard it does not work on the Undead,
or some monster i have yet to see called a Evil Eye.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Eye of Zomm-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I have
heard this is a spell that makes you a scout to check areas you dare not
go. I have not bought the spell so i can tell you no more about it.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Elementalings-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I noticed
as i looked at the spells that there were new spells for the 4 Pets, and
i asked the guild about them. I was told they were more powerful then the
one i had. So i bought my favorite Earth.I have not tried the others but
have been assured they are much like there smaller counterparts.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF99">After getting my spells i went out and started
attacking the Kobold camps with a renewed vigor. They fell much easier
with my new pet, and a Shield of Fire spell on him seemed to make taking
on more then one much easier. I also Joined forces with others to attack
Pumas and Full size Skells. this made me learn new things much faster.
I also ventured around more in my home(Steamfont mountains) and found there
were some amazing things to see. There were 3 or 4&nbsp; Observatories
located around the mountains and there were the amazing Windmills. I also
found a cave that contained Slavers with Bull Heads. I dared not venture
to close as there were tales of a Bull head that was so fearsome that the
guards were slaughtered by him. I heard his name was HERO but i know not
if this is true. I also saw my first flying drakes, they were all black
and most called them Young Ebon Drakes. i stayed away from these also.
And the HUGE rouge Clockworks, i had seen the Cargo Clockwork at my home
city but i didn't know the gnomes had built so many, and they had changed
to rouges, yet another thing i stayed away from.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12-15</TD>

<TD>As i felt i was ready for the fourth circle of magic i headed to town
to buy my spells.&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Rain of Blades-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">This
spell seemed to rain down fire from the sky on a group of attackers. I
use this spell only when there are more then one attackers.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Column of Fire-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">This
Spell seems to do a large amount of damage as it centers a flame on the
my target. I ma not sure if it is better then SHOCK OF BLADES, but i can
tell it does more damage, but it takes alot out of me to cast it, and a
long time for me to cast another. I fell this spell is to slow, but wheni
am helping a party and need to do damage quickly i use it alot.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Bind Affinity-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I find
if this spell is cast on me i can camp anywhere and always start there
again. I have also found that if i have somebody in my party i can make
them Bind to the ground in any city have learned this spell is very tough
to cast and i practice it any chance i get as it burns alot of manna and
when it fails i feel very weakened, i must practice this to get good, maybe
i will train with my guild master so i can get better faster.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Cancel Magic-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I have
not bought this spell, but have heard if my party has a magic spell cast
on them it would remove it. I must buy and try this sometime.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Burnout-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I have found
when this is cast on my pet he does more damage and seems to get hit alot
less. But after battles it seems to take him longer to rest and get back
to health. I do have some questions on this spell, i have no idea how long
it lasts as my pet will not tell me. And im not sure it is a wise spell
to use as my earth elemental gets hit regardless of if this spell is used
or not. and the slow regain is tough to wait on. I feel this spell would
be much better with one of the other elemental, but as i prefer the Earth
i have not had a chance to test this.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Summon Blade-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I have
not bought this spell, but have heard it summons a sword of some type to
hit magical creatures, as i cannot wield a sword i felt i didn't have a
use for it. BUT i have heard i can wield this weapon from others, and i
have also had party members ask me to summon them a blade when we are attacking
magical monsters so sometimes i wish i had it. mayhaps i will buy it soon.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Ward Summond-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I have
not purchased this spell as i have seen very few elemental there are some
around the Slaver mines, but i have not seen the need for this as they
seem to be little tales of them elsewhere in the world. I may be proved
wrong but i have not bought this spell as i see little use for it now.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Elementals-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">Again
new pet spells, i have bought the Earth and the Water at the urging of
another to see if the Water is as good as my Earth. After much testing
i still use my Earth almost all the time. I feel my new pets are quite
weak compared to my old ones. Maybe they will get better down the road.
I am much more careful about what i attack with them now. Fighting&nbsp;
monster that seems above my level has been left out of my daily activities,
where the old pets could handle the tougher monsters at there levels this
new one seems to have much tougher time going at it, i must help him much
more. Mayhaps trying some of the other pets is a wise choice now.But as
i can ill afford to buy spells i may not use i will wait awhile.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF99">I ventured towards the Slaver cave and took on
some of the Young Ebon Drakes, they are quite tough but i am beating them
with my pets help. Sometimes i must attack with my own blade or staff,
but i know this is a wise thing as i need to increase my ability with my
weapons for that day when my magicv fails. I also feel i am getting better
at attacking and defending my self the more i do this.I have fought a few
Elemental they give very little loot , most times nothing, but sometimes
a gem. The skells in the area by the mines seem to give good coin. I have
also attacked a harpy or two, they seem to be very tough, but the loot
is ok and they sometimes yield a gem . After getting used to my spells
i went into the caves and fought a few Bull heads, i found that my pet
with my help could take 2 if i was lucky but if more showed up i ran and
let my pet hold them off, yes a cowards tactic, but it was working and
keeping me alive. I joined with others in&nbsp; the mines and found it
much safer. I also noticed that sometimes the Minos ( as i now call the
bull heads) carried a much sought after axe that sold well to other adventures.
I found that if you take these to the main land they sold much better then
in the lands around my home. I also heard tell of some truly evil thing
in the mines that would make you attack your friends. And yes i found out
the hard way the roumors were true, i could not control my body and i attacked
many of my fellow adventures, they fell like chaff as i sent spell after
spell at them. Soon they released i was under a spell and took it upon
themselves to beat it out of me, well they beat a bit to good, and they
sent my soul back to the city so i could come back and pick my corpse clean.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR>
<TD>Level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16+</TD>

<TD>I have just reached the 5th circle and have began my hunt for spells.
I have not seem my new pet spell in Ak'Anon so have asked around and heard
it was in the High Elf city. Well after traveling to it i find the High
Elves do not like me much, as i approached the gates the guards ran out
and attacked me . As i was not expecting the attack i was unprepared and
fell quit swiftly. After i came back to my body and collected my things
with my summon corpse command and Invis. i started taking with the locals.
Soon one offered to go into the city and get the spell for me, he seemed
a nice lot so i gave him the plat&nbsp; ( which i might add gave me a sick
feeling in my stomach as he could have just ran away with my money). he
soon found the spell&nbsp; at a vender outside the Magic Library there,
he was tough to find.&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Summoning-Lesser-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">This
summons a pet, and there are yet again 4 variations, once again i have
picked a earth. the Spell isn't the big disappointment the last one was,
my pets seem slightly weak, but they are good enough to do the job.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Phantom Leather-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">This
spell required me to have a cats eye stone on me, it seems to increase
my defense against monsters.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Shielding- </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">This is
yet another variant of the shielding spell it seems but much better.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">the other spells have yet to be purchased as i
have just reached the 5th circle and have yet to make the money for others.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#33FF33"><FONT SIZE=+3>UPDATED:</FONT></FONT></I></B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">
I have finally made the money to buy new spells :</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">See Invisable- </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I
have found i can see people that are invisable. Which makes travling when
invisable much easier.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Shock Of Flames-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">
This Spell is a nice addtion to my damage spells it seems to hit the target
with a blast of flame.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Summon Heatstone-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">
This produces a item that you can give to players that cannot see in the
night.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Summon Throwing Dagger-(may be renamed)</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">
This produce a dagger for throwing..some classes use this, though i have
seen little call for it.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF6666">Identify-</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC"> I am not
sure what this spell is good for...As i seem to just "know" what things
are in the world.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">After getting stocked up on spells and the stones
needed to cast my pet. I headed out to see what the world held.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFCC">I traveled through a rocky mountains area called
ButcherBlock mountains. Here i found another race much like my own in size,
but they seemed of a stocky build. I found they didnt much like me, some
such shouts about my beliefs and my god, i have heard that some of my gnome
brothers can go near them but i cannot. As i travled the land i came to
a large gameboard, Chess i think they call it. At this place there were
many undead. I soon heard there was a ship that traveled to another land,
the home of the Humans and other such lower lifeforms. Upon hearing this
i quickly invis'ed myself ( i ahve become fond of being invis while travling,
makes it go quickly) and headed for the docks. After passing the Dwarf
Guards i snapped my fingers to remove the invis spell and waited for the
Ship. As i waited i heard many say they left all their belongings in the
bank for the trip , after asking why many said the ship was know to travel
on rare times to a different plane, and when one made the trip all ones
belongings were lost and rentry into our plane was normally without the
boat...and that a swim back to an island was sometimes quite hard. After
Reaching the new land and travling through a town called Freeport i moved
into a area called&nbsp; the common lands. I examined the beasts in this
area nad seen little of intrest. As i traveled through the land i heard
shouts of "Griffion to 2nd Inn" as i had passed an inn earlier i started
l;ooking for this "griffion" and as i creasted the hill there was a HUGE
bird, lion thingy with wings...I seen&nbsp; a guard rush to meet it...the
battel was fierce and the guard went down. I felt it was best to pass this
beasty by. As i travled fartehr i came to a land called West Commons. there
was a dervish camp here (bandits im told) and a larger Orc camp. I soon
came to a large forest. I set up camp at the entrance.</FONT>&nbsp;
