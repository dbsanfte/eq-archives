<td>&nbsp;OK OK I KNOW.... 2 months and bad news. I have quit updating
the site from lack of time and other reasons. I had 3 responces in e-mail
( all posative...thanks a ton). If anybody would like to take over..let
me know. I have plans on a EQ SATIRE site, or
<br>opinion site. CHeck out EQ-Casters for the best Mage ( and other caster)
info. I have seen 1000 hits here since i quit updateing
<br>and it makes me feel good . But i must say i also feel bad since i
didnt live up to my Hype. I may start trying to update this Mage Page again
if i dont get a taker on taking over. Reguardless you will see my poor
english skills hacking on what is happening in EQ
<br>and what others say soon. This page will stay as a sub page of my new
effort. Im sure to offend, make fun of..AND HOPEFULLY make a few people
laugh.</td>

the last patch:&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF9900">NEW ZONE</font>: Solusek Ro-- Quests for armour
for most classes ( yep us mages)&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF9900">MAGE STUFF</font>: Some of our items are better,
of effects increased ( looking into what?)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Burnout Series of spells has had HP loss reduced and Stat Buff increased,
BUT now last 15 minutes.&nbsp;
<p>Research Quest page updated with ONE new quest ( sorry just no time
to do um all yet).&nbsp;
<p>I will admit i have been playing Asherons Call way to much, but i havent
forgot my MAGE, in fact am playing him this weekend some.&nbsp;
<p>And want to thank "<font color="#FFCC33">Aliya</font>" for the boost...
and to answer her Question...Yep the pets take a stone&nbsp; (malachite)
after 16.&nbsp;
<p>Im going to try my darndest to get more up this weekend.</td>

<td>Sorry for lack of updates, no e-mails on any info or new stuff. Have
heard that they are testing a new Zone on the TEST server. The zone is
just for Quests. AND the good news there is Mage only quests for armour.
Bad thing, they are very tough quests. As for the Quests on this page,
look for an update this week for sure.&nbsp; I have been playing Asherons
Call a little bit, and will say that Mage types there, are very tough to
play. Warriors are much easier to play. So im a warrior now. Hehe, dont
worry i wont forget my mage. and still want to keep the few mages out there
that are interested with as much info as i can. Also there will (hopefully)
be a high level mage doing an anylasis on spells soon, his thoughts and
ideas of why they are, and are not good.</td>

<td>Spell Page Updated (<font color="#FF6600">thanks JMazzie</font>) (
still need lots of info) another link to a guildmates Eq Page. Its 9:00
PM and EQ is still Down ( since 3:00PM) i hope its not just me having problems.&nbsp;
I did test the Summoned stuff disappering after you log..Good news..just
the person who logs stuff goes bye bye ( not sure..but the wording in Verents
Patch screwed me up, maybe all you knew that already). Ok you guys out
there ..<font color="#CC6600">belly up some good info</font>...Im looking
for things like where a mage can solo in the high levels ( and if any of
you low guys want to give me tips on solo spots..please do). Well with
<font color="#FF9900">Jmazzie's</font>
huge amount of work i have most of the spell page filled in. Current updates
in Research N Quest is next.</td>

<td>I added a research and quest page, updated the links page with a new
link, added a new Tip in the Apprentice Guide, and will be doing more on
the spells soon. I plan on adding all the quests that are good for mages
( i have roughly 10). Im sorry for the delay in getting this info up, but
it takes alot more time then i thought to get this all together.&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000">LATEST UPDATE PATCH CHANGES FOR MAGES:</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">-Casting time on High level WARD spells has been
lowered.</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">-Summond food and water now disapper when you
logg </font><font color="#FFFF99">( does this mean the bandages i gave
out before i logg disapper when im gone?)</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">-Summoned items will not stay in the bank any
more</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">Well im not thinking the changes did us much good.
The shortened casting time ..while nice, i doubt is noticable. The changes
to the summoned items is not a good thing. I have no idea what the reason
for these changes would be. The hassel of going to a bank to drop of food
and water ( or a some arrows )sure couldnt unbalance game play could it?&nbsp;</font>

<td>Well it seems either the link on Cazik Thule corner or my complaining
has lossend some lips. I have recieved some e-mails with corrections (
spells corrected, or added to the ones there)(<font color="#FF6600">thanks
JMazzie</font>). I have also heard there may be words for sale at vendors
in some mage guilds, this may be so research is easier, or just a mage
selling the word after succesfully researching his spell..i will be checking
this out this weekend. But for those 24th level mages who want to reserch
either of the foodstuff spells i have heard the Erudia has Trancendance
for sale ( at least on one server), as soon as i hear or see for myself
i will let you know more (<font color="#FF6600">thanks Bo Hu</font>). Current
plans are to do a huge Update to the spell list, add a research page, and
if i get time add a little to my Journal...THIS will all happen this weekend
i hope. ALSO the L:inks Page has been updated with some new sites..take
a look.&nbsp;
<p><font color="#FF0000">LATEST UPDATE CHANGES FOR&nbsp; MAGES:</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000">- The Mana cost on some Magician damage shields
has been slightly reduced</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">- Magi research components have been added to
more monsters throughout the world.&nbsp; </font><font color="#FFFF99">(thank
the gods)</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells)
do less damage&nbsp;</font><font color="#FFFF99"> ( not sure if this is
all pets or Just Necro)</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I recently read on another page ( wish i could remeber which) that there
are some plans for the Campers out there that are to high level&nbsp; for
the Mob they are camping. I cant qoute this cuz i cant find the page again
( and this is older news) BUT i read that the plan is to either:&nbsp;
<br><font color="#FFCC00">make more spots for good stuff and maybe a different
name ( JBOOTS, will also be called TBOOTS ( travlers boots)), and so on.
Also they may make it if you do not get EXP for a mob..it wont drop any
items.PLEASE remember these are not for certain, and are big maybe ideas..</font>
<p>AND IM SURE you have all heard about the CURRENT policy:&nbsp;
<br><font color="#FFCC00">If a high level group is camping a spawn for
Items and not EXP and a low level group comes along..the High levels are
spose to move on..if not, you are spose to patition a guide to move them
( like a guide is ever around when you need one)..Again i read this on

<td>Spell list started, but i need alot of help. If you can fill in any
of the blanks up to 20 let me know ( or locations after that). Most of
stuff on spell page has been taken from other pages so some info may be
wrong.&nbsp; Im counting on some help from you guys ( are we the only group
out there that doesnt voice its opinion on stuff? i havent got 1 E-mail
with anything..complaints, im full of BS, nothing...Im one character and
need help.. I plan on filling in what i know on the spells, then working
on getting all the research info i can find on a page ( i havent found
one word for the 24th level reserch spells in the game myself). If i dont
get some input i may just follow the other mage pages...no updates ( ok..so
i havent done much here...but i have nothing other then i have read on
other pages..and just rehashing stuff from other pages seems a bit old.)</td>

<td>Second Update Today: Added to the Links Page and i have noticed i have
a bunch of broken links ( my code). working on fixing it&nbsp; sorry about
that.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Full month since i started this. After i seen much better looking pages
i deceided i would just forget the idea. Well after watching the other
pages and seeing little in the way of info and so on i figured what the
heck...I will try do a little work on this page and see if i can add some
stuff i have learned along the way. First off...to those that have started
pages...( im not giving you any heck about updates..i know how hard Real
Life is). NEXT and most Important..this page could in all likely hood be
much worse then any page you have ever seen. I know little of HTML and
also have a life that takes up most of my time ( oh..wait a minute..EQ
isnt life is it?..well i have other stuff to do) Right now there is very
little here, in fact nothing..but Cloks Journal has naything in it.SO if
you are a pre 16th mage and want to read the ramblings of a mad Gnome (
that cant spell)&nbsp; please read it and flame my little hinny about it.</td>
