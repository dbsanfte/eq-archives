<P><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold">Dugmaren is the keeper of the histories
and knowledge of the dwarven race. His clergy maintains a written history
for their clans for use by future generations as well as confirm new inventions
owners so that proper credit can be given to the inventor. His worshippers
are mainly scholars, inventors and tinkerers and every one of his temples
doubles as a library. It is said that if you cannot find out about something
dwarven from one of his temples, it didn't happen.</FONT>
