<center><font color=white font face="Tolkien" font size="5" font align="center">So, my friend, you are interested in our circle.  You are well met, and well come.  Have a seat, and I will tell you a bit.  But I will be brief, for our actions speak for themselves.<br><p>  We are a band of warriors, and healers, of mages and thieves, of rangers and minstrels.  We are united together in a common bond, but not under a common master.  For we have none.  We banded together, and have formed the Circle as you now find us.  We fight for each other, and we will die for each other.  We are friends.  We are family.  And this is our home.  Feel free to look around, but have a care with what lies within.  For we are fiercely protective of that which is ours.<br><p>  Within these walls you will find out more about us, both as the Circle, and the folk that make it up. You will find out what we stand for, and who we stand with.  What we fight for, and what we fight against.   These are our stories, and our lives.  Our passions, our triumphs, our blunders, and even our pains.  We hide nothing from each other, nor from you.  We are who we are.<br><br><br><p>  We are the Circle of Ronin. </center></table>
