<center><img SRC="daggerlt.gif" height=56 width=60><u><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FFFF00"><font size=+2>The
Warhammer Code of Conduct</font></font></font></u><img SRC="daggerrt.gif" height=60 width=67>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>To
be a Mithril Warhammer is a special thing. Only the finest and best examples
of each race are allowed this title. While this makes our numbers small,
it also makes us strong. We share a kinship with each other that will keep
us alive in the dire times ahead. On the stone table in the Shrine of Light
is our code. I will tell you in more plain words here what it means.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>We,
the Warhammers, serve the Light in all our ways, with all our life. We
stand as a beacon in the darkness of the night, shining as hope burns,
telling that someone keeps watch. We stand against the Darkness which grows
with the passing of time, as Guardians and Protectors of the good races
of Norrath. We are unfailing in our Justice and strive to keep our Honor
clean. Our Loyalty to one another and the Light is renown in the land and
our Courage is well known. But most of all, our Spirit is strong. Stronger
then the Darkness which surrounds us. Let our Light shine out even brighter
in these dark times.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>We
aid the good races of Norrath in many small ways, such as a helpful heal
or shielding spell and possibly giving of a small item to someone in need.
We do not give money or items to anyone that begs under any circumstances.
Instead, tell them you will help them for a fight or two and then go along
on your way if you have time and desire to do so.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>We
follow the way of Light at all times. Spirit is the base of this. Always
keep your guild and guildmates dear to your heart. Upon this rests Loyalty
and Honor, which are the walls of our fortress. They come from your spirit
and will serve you well in life. Finally, from those come Justice and Courage
which will make your name known throughout the lands of Norrath. One spoken
with pride by those who call you friend and fear from those that name you
an enemy.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>To
promote the kinship within the Order and to better be prepared to serve
the Light, there shall be Strike Teams created. These Strike Teams will
be used for hunting the more powerful evil minions of the Darkness and
in times of war, against our enemies. PvP training will be on Sunday afternoon
before and after our hunt.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>Makeup
of the strike teams will be as follows:</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Ork
Krami or higher for leader</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Minimum
two Hazkul Grobkuli</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Lower
Ranks to fill in as needed.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>Each
strike team should consist of the following members:</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Two
"Tanks"</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>One
"Medic"</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>One
"Nuker"</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>I
would recommend adding one healer then one more tank or nuker to round
out the full six member team but, this basic set up will serve you well
starting about level five to seven.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>Promotions
are loosely based on two things, availability of positions and personal
combat ability mixed with loyalty and devotion to our guild. If you show
yourself willing to devote not only game time but real world time to make
the Warhammers special, you will recieve promotions. As of right now, the
highest level of promotion is Ork Krami. Here is the breakdown of the&nbsp;
ranks.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>One
Rik Drungi for the entire Order.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>One
Lok Trommi for the entire Order.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>One
Ork Krami per strike team (4 to 6 members).</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Hazkul
Grobkuli and lower are unlimited.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>Donation
of coin and items to the Warhammers are gratfully accepted. These will
be of use in setting up new members who have proved themselves worthy of
the title of Hazkul Grobkuli or higher with suitable weapons, armor and
spells. It also will provide for a common store of food and drink along
with a reserve of coin for trading and funds to make our guild hall the
grandest in all of Norrath. Only rare, special or expensive (5pp or higher)
items need to be donated and only gold or platinum coins. Contact an officer
or myself to donate.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>I
need from all members these things to be sent to either my email address
in the study or Cestus's email on the Roster:</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Character
Pic</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Character
Bio</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Character
Name (Full name)</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Character
race</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Character
class</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+1>Lastly,
I will be having many small quests and special events for the Warhammers
as I can. The more members and help we have, the more of these will be
possible.</font></font></font>
