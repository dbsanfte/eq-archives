dwarves make their homes in the rugged mountains and valleys of the land.
They are clannish in nature and tend to keep to themselves by discouraging
others from visiting their strongholds. On average, they are four and a
half feet tall and weight about 170 stones. Hair is black, light brown
or white with reddish skin tones. Mountain dwarves think of themselves
as the "first Dwarves" that all other dwarven races came from.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
