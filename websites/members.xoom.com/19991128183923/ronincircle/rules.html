 <p> We all may have the same goals in Norrath; to achieve what is
  laid before us, Quests, seasons, and FUN!! </p><br>

 <p> However, there are other reasons to be here and those are what we as a
  Guild look for in prospective members.</p><br>

  <p>1. Honor - to watch out for those around you, to stand to the bitter end
  and YES, even death. Such things happen when in honorable battle. </p><br>

  <p>2. Justice - this may take many forms, such as protecting those weaker than
  you from others who may try to exploit them, escorting a younger adventurer
  thru a dangerous new land, or defending a small band from a train dumped on
  them by an inscrupulous warrior, or providing any special services (such as
  bindings, enchanting metals, etc) at a fair and reasonable fee, in a timely
  manner.</p><br> 

  <p>3. Loyalty - to sum this up, friendship. To stand beside your friends to the
  bitter end, whilst knowing they will be standing beside you; for this is what
  friends do for one another. And who knows, maybe you will live because you
  fought rather than ran away. Not that we live to die; if we see that the odds
  are to great we will flee only to fight another day!! </p><br>

  <p>4. To always have someone to adventure with, no matter what circle you may
  have achieved in your travels, and to have assistance, willing and able, to
  help you achieve a goal that is still slightly out of your reach.</p><br>
