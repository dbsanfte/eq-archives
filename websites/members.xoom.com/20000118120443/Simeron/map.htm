always be suprises out there for you.</font></font></font>

<p><b><u><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF99FF"><font size=+2>FAYDWER</font></font></font></u></b>
<p><b><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+1>Land
of the Elder Races, Faydwer is home to Dwarves, Wood and High Elves and
Gnomes. Kaladim is the capital of the Dwarves, Kelethin is the Wood Elves
home in the trees, Felwithe is the stronghold of the High Elves and Ak'anon
the home of the Gnomes.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+1>Some
general advice is to stay close to the main entrances of your city until
you progress several levels and remember, what you kill will effect your
reputation sometimes. That can and will come back to help or harm you.
Places to check out are the Giant Chessboard in the Butcherblock Mtns,
The Crushbone Clan stronghold (Orcs) in Greater Faydark and the Windmills
of the Steamfront Mtns. But, as always, be warned that there are many creatures
that will hunt you as you hunt them.</font></font></font></b>

<p><b><u><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF99FF"><font size=+2>Antonica</font></font></font></u></b>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+1>Antonica
is a HUGE place that is by far the biggest of the three continents. It
is the land of the humans, half elves, barbarians, ogres, trolls, dark
elves and halflings. Again, stay close to your home city until you gain
a few levels before you venture out into the world lest you become dinner
for a griffon or giant. For goodly races, the lands of Neriak (Dark Elves),
Grobb (Trolls) and Oggok (Ogres) are hostile. Evil races have the other
problem in that Freeport, RiverVale, Qeynos and Halas are hostile to them.
A boat to Faydwer leaves Freeport while Odus is reached by boat from Qeyons.
For sights to see, Hill Giants and Griffons in the commonlands cant be
beat. And Sand Giants in the Desert of Ro are even more impressive. Just
make sure you keep a healthy distance. You will be able to see them I assure
you.</font></font></font>

<p><b><u><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#FF99FF"><font size=+2>Odus</font></font></font></u></b>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+1>The
land of Odus is home to the High Men. Dark skinned and highly intellegent,
they tend to be spellweavers of extreme ability. As before, stay near your
home city until you have leveled several times. I loved the city of Erudin.
Sites to see are the town library, hall of magics and the city hall. I
was truely impressed with the details within these buildings. I plan on
visiting there again soon.</font></font></font>
