<P><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold">&nbsp;Ulaa is the god of nature
for the dwarves. Shrines and churches must be in hilly or mountainous regions
and be roofed or underground. Services involve low, resonant chanting and
the rhythmic pounding of hammers on stone (with careful care to keep the
sounds pleasing and musical). Ulaa is one of the elder gods. She is thought
to possibly be one of the First Dwarves. Ulaa is most commonly worshipped
by Sundered Dwarf tribes that live above ground mostly and farmers. Her
worshipers do not honor Moradin though this does not appear to concern
Moradin however, as the two gods are on good (if not amicable) terms with
each other. Priests of Ulaa are only rarely adventurers, preferring to
stay at their homes and protect them. Her worshippers are most commonly
found in areas with significant humanoid and giant threats. Her priests
are expect to lead their people into battle (when necessary) and to preserve
the faith in the face of adversity.</FONT>
