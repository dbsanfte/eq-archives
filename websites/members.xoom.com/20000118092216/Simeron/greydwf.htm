dwarves, or Duergar, are the evil side of the dwarven family. They too
headed deep within the earth, like the deep dwarves, but their souls were
perverted by some dark power and they now serve evil. They are normally
bald with beards of white or grey with pale, pasty skin. They are four
feet tall and weigh 120 stones normally. While they do still smith and
mine, their crafts are not as good as other dwarves. Having lived underground
for so long, sunlight is painful to them and they dislike open areas. So,
their try to avoid the surface as much as possible. Deep dwarves are in
a constant state of war with duergar due to limits on living space and
resources underground.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
