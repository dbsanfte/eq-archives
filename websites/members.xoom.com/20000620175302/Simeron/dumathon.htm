<P><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold">The god of mining and underground
exploration. He is called the Silent Keeper, for he never speaks, but may
guide his faithful through fate and happenstance to the richest veins and
the greatest treasures. Dumathoin worshippers are mainly miners and those
dwarves that rely on the ores, gems and stones mined and quarried from
the earth. His priests and priestesses can call upon powerful earth elementals,
mud creatures and such in time of need. Dumathoin is said to guard the
treasures placed within the ground for the dwarves to find. He rests on
the Mithril Pinnacle upon which the whole world spins. The clergy of Dumathoin
is on very good terms with most of the dwarven gods save Abbathor, due
to Abbathor's followers stealing of gemstone and the like. Priests of Dumathoin
also tend be extremely tight-lipped, particularly with information that
might aid non-dwarven races.</FONT>
