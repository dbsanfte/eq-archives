<p>This post is meant to be a beginning guide and spell description list
for new Druids. You have all seen the pathetic spell descriptions posted
and included in the "strategy guide". They are nothing more than a name
and a very brief and non-descriptive summary of the spell. I found that
especially once I was purchasing 3<sup>rd</sup> rank spells for almost
5pp a pop, I desperately wanted to know what exactly each spell did and
how it would improve my survivability. Sure we eventually want all the
spells, but at that price I was scrapping together the cash to buy one
at a time and I wanted the most bang for my buck on each purchase. Asking
in-game was not helpful either, as it seems most others are as in the dark
as I was about various spell effects. So here is my contribution to the
EQ and Druid community. I hope others take the initiative and do something
similar for the other classes. My plan is to continue this guide in installments
as I reach each new spell ranking. Hope this helps some struggling or curious
Druid out there 8-) Feel free to email me any questions you might have,
but remember I’m only currently 17<sup>th</sup> level.
<p>First off I started as a Wood Elf. They are a pretty average race. They
don’t get any really nice stats, but they get decent Wisdom, Agility and
Dex. I don’t think race matters that much. Infravision is nice tho. A BIG
negative to starting as an elf is that you have to start in Greater Feydark,
which is THE most crowded zone.
<p>The first four levels are pretty generic to all classes. I highly recommend
getting a getting a rusty scimitar as soon as you can. Some people recommend
the two-handed great staff route, but I found the attack speed too slow
for my tastes. Also I heard rumors of magic Druid only scimitars, so I
want to make sure my 1h slashing skill is up to speed just in case 8-).
However it is probably a good idea to keep 1h Bashing, 2h Bashing and 1h
Slashing all maxxed, as this gives you the greatest flexibility to use
the best weapon available. As far as skills go, Wood Elf Druids get Hide,
Forage, and Bind Wounds. Of these Forage is by far the most important and
useful. Practice it constantly and you won’t have to be running back and
paying those high prices for food and water as much.
<p>Combat at this stage is pretty satisfying for our class. We fight, it
appears, just as well as the fighters…especially if you are using a scimitar.
Plus we can burn (cast offensive spells) just as well as the mages, and
heal &amp; buff just as well as the clerics. Pretty cool! At the early
levels this is a big advantage. If you want to take monsters out with melee,
you can heal up afterwards and continue on, where fighters have to sit
and wait. You can also choose to take on <b>slightly</b> tougher monsters,
because you can do fighter melee and mage burn to take them out, plus buff
yourself before the combat starts. Here is the lowdown on the first level
Druid spells:
<p>1) <b><u><font color="#808000">Skin Like Wood</font></u></b>. This is
an excellent buff spell. It improves slightly as your skill increases.
Its effect is to add about 4 to your overall Armor Class, and 15 hp to
your hit point total. A must have spell. I keep it in effect all the time,
but as with other buff spells I memorize it only as I need it and then
un-memorize it to use the slot for something else. It is eventually replaced
by Skin Like Rock.
<p>2) <b><u><font color="#808000">Burst of Flame</font></u></b>. A minor
burn spell. It costs 7 mana to cast and only does 3-6 or so damage, but
it’s not much different than the other classes first burn spell. Comes
in as a useful supplement to your melee attack. You have to time it so
you begin casting immediately after the monster attacks to improve your
chance of not getting interrupted. A must have spell until you get better.
<p>3) <b><u><font color="#808000">Minor Healing</font></u></b>. Again,
this spell is pretty much the same as other 1<sup>st</sup> rank healing
spells. It does a fine job for the first five levels or so, but after that
it becomes useless to heal people in combat, because the monsters can dish
out so much more damage than this spell can heal. Unfortunately Druids
don’t get anything better until 9<sup>th</sup> level. Its still useful
from 5<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> as an after combat restoration spell,
although you have to cast it many many times. Once you get Light Healing
you won’t use this spell much (at least I don’t)
<p>4) <b><u><font color="#808000">Flame Lick</font></u></b>. A very minor
DOT (Damage Over Time) spell. It doesn't do much damage, but its most beneficial
effect is to reduce the AC of the target by a few points, which can make
a difference at the lower levels. It requires a fire beetle eye to cast,
but it does NOT consume it after each casting. A fellow Druid by the name
of Tanas wrote and told me this is an extremely useful spell to use at
the lower levels. It is best to use it as an "opener" to draw the monster
to you, so it's AC has been lowered before you engage it in melee.
<p>5) <b><u><font color="#808000">Snare</font></u></b>. This is a very
good spell. . In effect it halves the speed of an adversary. It only costs
20 mana. I used it to fight in Steamfront against skeletons and earth elementals,
and it is resisted about 30% of the time, but the low mana cost means you
can cast it several times without burning too much mana. Once the monster
is ensnared you do the "Run, turn and burn" routine until it is dead or
injured enough to take out with melee. This spell is also an excellent
"finisher" against monsters that have a tendency to run when they get low
on hit points. Rather than use an expensive burn spell to kill them, cast
snare. Because the monster is wounded it slows down to a creeping pace,
and once it is damaged to 1/4 health it stops moving altogether. A beneficial
side effect of this is even tho the monster is no longer moving it is still
in "flee" mode and will not attack you. You can finish it off with melee
attacks at your leisure.
<p>6) <b><u><font color="#808000">Endure Fire</font></u></b>. This is another
long lasting buff spell, so feel free to cast it during your "buff" phase
prior to going adventuring. It only costs 20 mana so its pretty reasonable
for as long as it lasts. For testing purposes I attacked a few Ebony Drakes
in Steamfront and the damage I took from them was significantly less than
when I went in without this spell, so it does a good job. However it is
important to note that it does NOT convey immunity, it just reduces the
damage.
<p>7) <b><u><font color="#808000">Lull Animal</font></u></b>. Tanas highly
recommended this spell to deal with those annoying plague rats in Steamfront.
Therefore I picked it up and headed to Steamfront. I partnered up with
a Magician (first time I did that, they are a pretty cool class). Unfortunately
I didn’t know how to properly use the spell at first and got my partner
killed. I blasted a skeleton, and when two rats joined the fight I thought
I would lull them so we could take on the skel. Wrong move. Lull Animal
does NOT work in combat, just like Gate. It is essential to cast it BEFORE
combat, which is kind of lame because you have to guess which animals are
going to potentially gang up on you. Anyway, once I started using it properly
it worked fine. I would find a skeleton, and if he had Plague Rats near
him I would Lull the rats and then blast the skeleton. However, if you
would rather attack first and see what animals might join the fray, you
can use…
<p>8) <b><u><font color="#808000">Panic Animal</font></u></b>. Same mana
cost as Lull Animal and you can cast it in combat. It makes the rats run
away, which is good. I kept this one memorized instead of Lull Animal.
<p>Update: This spell continues to be useful well beyond the newbie levels.
Although it is sort of "specialized" in that you only memorize it when
you know you might encounter tough animals, it has saved my partner’s and
my life several times. We were fighting crocodiles and caimans in the Oasis
of Marr. Those suckers can be tough. Several times we were on the losing
side of things and I would fire off a panic animal and it would run away,
thus allowing us to rest up or zone or both. Any monster that conn’ed yellow
or less I could Panic without it resisting. However the deepwater crocodiles,
which con red, resisted every time. Much like Ward Summoned, in the right
circumstances this is a great spell.
<p>9) <b><u><font color="#808000">Sense Animals</font></u></b>. A spell
that I struggle to find a use for. When cast it spins your body around
and points you in the direction of the nearest animal, and targets that
animal as well. Unfortunately its not like tracking where you get to pick
from a list of potential targets, it automatically selects the nearest
one. Some might say you can use it as a newbie to find animals and go kill
them, but that’s not very Druid-like is it?
<p>10) <b><u><font color="#808000">Dance of Fireflies</font></u></b>. This
spell creates a globe of light that you can place in an inventory slot.
It works well if you do not have Infravision. Since I’m a wood elf and
can see at night anyway, its only purpose for me is to raise Divination
skill.
<p>That brings us to 5<sup>th</sup> level where things change dramatically.
At first this is an exciting time because of course you have access to
a new rank of spells. Unfortunately you will soon find that the run from
5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup> is the worst time for a Druid. In fact
it got so bad for me I quit and became a human mage for a couple days before
the calling brought me back. I’m glad I came back to my favorite character,
but never the less this is a trying time for the Druid. The problem lies
in the fact that at 5<sup>th</sup> level character classes become much
more distinct. All of a sudden your Druid can’t fight nearly as well as
the fighters, he can’t burn nearly as well as the mages, and he can’t heal
or buff nearly as well as the clerics. To top it off, you still don’t have
meditate (until 8<sup>th</sup>) so it takes you a long time in between
combats to recover now that your mana total is getting higher. Struggle
through this period however and things get better. Its pretty important
to group at this point, because you probably need to kill orcs to get experience
and you can’t do that solo yet. Here are descriptions of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
rank spells
<p>1) <b><u><font color="#808000">Burst of Fire</font></u></b>. A burn
spell that replaces Burst of Flame. It costs 15 mana to cast and does 13-15
points of damage. It is just the next progression of burn spell and you
use it identically as you would Burst of Flame. I keep it memorized all
the time
<p>2) <b><u><font color="#808000">Gate</font></u></b>. This spell of course
teleports you to your home point, but I want to issue some warnings about
it. It should be used as a convenience spell only at this point. Do not
think that you can use it to get out of a bad situation when three orcs
are pounding on you. I have tried to do this many times and it just doesn’t
work. Even if the monsters all miss you during the long casting period,
the spell will still be interrupted. I don’t know if it simply won’t allow
you to cast it while in combat or what. Another bad side effect of trying
to cast this spell while in combat is even tho it will always be interrupted,
it also always goes through the entire casting count-down cycle. Unlike
other spells that immediately reset your casting timer when you get interrupted,
gate will continue to count down until the end before it gives you the
interruption message. If you were in bad shape when you tried to cast it
then you have virtually guaranteed your death. You are better off running
than wasting time trying to cast this spell to get out of combat. Those
warnings said, it is awfully nice when your three zones from home and loaded
with loot to be able to instantly go home 8-) I keep this one memorized
all the time.
<p>3) <b><u><font color="#808000">Cure Poison/Cure Disease</font></u></b>.
These spells work great and don’t cost much mana. Their rather specialized
nature requires them only to be memorized as needed. Also, the tougher
poisons/diseases require you to cast them multiple times.
<p>4) <b><u><font color="#808000">Camouflage</font></u></b>. A very good
spell. Its effect is to make you invisible in outdoor zones. Due to its
very erratic duration I didn’t like this spell much when I first got it.
Sometimes it only lasts a few seconds. But as I began soloing in Crushbone
around 9<sup>th</sup> level I came to appreciate this spell a lot more.
Its best feature is its low mana cost (only 15). So even if you have to
cast it a couple times to get it to "stick" it is worth it. I use it to
hunt down blue and white con’d orcs and to prevent trains from killing
me while I meditate. It is important to watch the message section closely
for the "you return to view" message and take immediate action when you
see it. I keep this one memorized and active all the time. Just make sure
you cast all other buff spells BEFORE this one, as any spell casting or
combat action dispels it.
<p>5) <b><u><font color="#808000">Grasping Roots</font></u></b>. An OK
spell. It is pretty expensive mana-wise and it is resisted often. But if
its not resisted then it does 10hp of damage to the target and keeps them
frozen in place for maybe 10-30 seconds. I do like to use this spell when
I encounter a white or yellow con’d orc that appears to be alone. I will
cast this spell on it, and if it resists then I am plenty far enough away
to run away, but if it doesn’t resist then I go through a massive mana
dump and burn him with everything I got. For white con’d orcs this is usually
enough to weaken them to the point you can take them out with melee combat,
but with yellow it will still be a nasty melee fight with an uncertain
outcome. But regardless, the spell does have its specialized uses and I
keep it memorized for those times when opportunity presents itself.
<p>6) <b><u><font color="#808000">Invoke Lightning</font></u></b>. This
is probably the best spell out of this rank. Although it can only be cast
in outdoor zones and it is pretty expensive mana-wise (I think 32 mana),
it does good damage (typically 25 points) in a small area of effect. This
spell is at its best when you are grouped with a fighter. Have your fighter
friend attack a group of monsters and then back up several steps. The backing
up will cause the monsters to group tightly together as they chase after
him. It is important to note that the spell will only effect things in
a 1 space radius around the target. So I like to say the monsters need
to be "shoulder to shoulder" and then I cast it on the central one. Be
careful tho as this really irritates the monsters and they will often make
a run at you 8-) I keep this spell memorized at all times.
<p>7) <b><u><font color="#808000">Whirling Wind</font></u></b>. Another
new spell I just acquired. It’s not bad, but not great either. Going against
Elementals and ebony drakes it does 25pts of damage to creatures, and supposedly
stuns them, but the stun duration seemed so short I didn’t even notice
it. Also this spell was completely resisted several times, unlike Ignite.
I believe it costs 30 or 35 mana, not for sure which, but I know it is
not as efficient damage to mana as Ignite is. I do not keep this one on
my memorized list.
<p>**Tanas corrected me on this spell, giving some useful pointers:
<p>I use this spell constantly. It has a ratio of 24:24 i believe. Much
better than wasting 32 on Lightning if you are only fighting one creature.
It has two drawbacks however. This is your first Conjuration spell and
you will fizzle it some until you get your Conjuration skill up. But, at
level 9 my Conj is close to being maxed out thanks to my using it. It can
also be resisted, which is a drawback. But again, you just need to work
the skill a bit. One thing to remember, in a close battle I would rather
hit with WW for 24 than Burst of Fire for 11. I use this as an opener a
good bit. Plus, it looks really cool, especially with that small stun effect
=)
<p>8) <b><u><font color="#808000">Ward Summoned</font></u></b>. This is
a pretty specialized spell, as it only does damage to summoned creatures
like Elementals. However, when you are fighting those types of creatures,
it is by far the best spell in your arsenal at this point. It is pretty
expensive to cast, but it was doing a massive 41 pts of damage against
earth Elementals this morning and was only resisted once out of many castings.
By casting Snare, then Ward Summoned four or five times I was destroying
earth Elementals without getting a scratch on me. Unfortunately they rarely
carry treasure so I went back to skeletons 8-)
<p>9) <b><u><font color="#808000">Harmony</font></u></b>. The sum total
effect of this spell that I can determine is to put another Icon on your
screen. It has no other noticeable effect. If somebody has a clue as to
what it does please email me.
<p>Update: I've had several emails about this spell. Most of them claim
some that it has some sort of area of effect calming influence on creatures,
but every emailer claiming this also had difficulty verifying whether it
actually made any difference. One emailer claimed he took less damage from
monsters when he had this spell in effect. I've not been able to verify
any of these claims.
<p>Ok that brings us to 8<sup>th</sup> level at which point we get meditation
yaaa!!! This makes things better as you don’t spend as much time recovering
from combat, and it becomes much more efficient to burn mana in combat
instead of allowing monsters to bash your hit points down.
<p>Then we hit 9<sup>th</sup> level. At which point things get better and
worse all at once. The better part is you get some pretty good spells and
I found if I was careful I could start soloing in Crushbone, something
other mages can’t do so well. The worse part is the incredible amount of
money you have to start spending on spells. 3<sup>rd</sup> rank spells
are almost 5pp each. This fact was really what prompted me to write this
guide (plus its better than working). With very limited resources I did
not want to waste money on "lame" spells that are inevitably present at
every rank. At this point my leveling slowed down considerably because
I was so money starved that I attacked every orc in sight, and at this
point most of them con green so you don’t get any experience. However,
once you get the spells you need you can be more selective and get back
to more efficient experience gaining. So here they are in order that I
would purchase them if I had to do it over again:
<p>1) <b><u><font color="#808000">Ignite</font></u></b>. The next burn
spell. It cost 30 mana and consistently does 33 pts (+1per level above
14th) of damage in combat So its slightly more mana efficient than the
Burst of Fire spell, and it’s a whole lot more useful to cast one spell
for 33 than it is to cast twice for 30, especially when you figure in the
odds of interruption. Getting this spell makes Grasping Root a little more
effective because you can burn a lot more in the limited time the monster
is held in place.
<p>2) <b><u><font color="#808000">Light Healing</font></u></b>. This replaced
Minor Healing for me. I don’t think its any more mana-efficient, but it
sure is a lot faster. It also makes you a bit more useful in groups as
you can now heal party members somewhat effectively during combat.
<p>**Tanas has this to add:
<p>This spell has a Heal:Mana ratio of 30:25 which makes it a little more
efficient than Lesser Heal which is 10:10.
<p>3) <b><u><font color="#808000">Thistlecoat</font></u></b>. Increases
your AC by 4 or 5 pts plus it does 1pt of damage to any monster that strikes
you. The good thing about it is that it combines very will with Skin Like
Wood and Shield of Thistles. This spell lasts a long time, and like all
buff spells I only memorize it when I need to recast it.
<p>Update: This is one of the longest lasting buff spells you have at this
point. It lasts longer than Skin Like Wood and Strength.
<p>4) <b><u><font color="#808000">Firefist</font></u></b>. Another long
lasting buff spell. It increases your chance to hit during melee, which
means less whiffs, which is nice 8-). Its pretty expensive mana-wise.
<p>Update: Of your "long-lasting" buff spells, this one has the shortest
duration. Its lasts roughly half as long as Skin Like Wood Although its
somewhat annoying to have to stop and recast it when your other buff spells
are still going strong, it is useful to keep track of about how long you
have till all your buff spells wear out (assuming you cast them all at
once). It DOES have a noticeable effect. I definitely hit more often for
maximum damage than when I do not buff with this spell. If I feel there
is a strong likelihood of engaging in melee combat I always cast this spell.
<p>5) <b><u><font color="#808000">Shield of Thistles</font></u></b>. I’m
really can’t decide which I should put in the #4 slot. It really is a toss
up between this spell and Firefist. When I first got this spell I was angry
that I had wasted my money, because the duration on it is extremely short
and the damage it does is only 5pts when a monster hits you. However now
that I’ve had it a while I have come to realize that this spell is one
of the MOST efficient damage/mana cost spells you have at this point. When
combined with Thistlecoat, you dish out 6pts of damage every time a monster
hits you. Through the course of combat in which you decide to go primarily
melee instead of burn, a monster might hit you 10-15 times, so the accumulated
damage of this spell is very nice. It costs 40 mana to cast, and if you
dish out 50-100pts of damage during a combat with this spell then its more
mana efficient than any other spell you have at this point. Unfortunately
the duration of the spell will usually not even last the entire length
of the combat. I smile however when a monster dings me for 1 pt of damage
and I give him 6pts in return, very nice 8-). I don’t bother using it if
I determine that I am going to do a mana burn to take out a monster, as
those combats are usually much shorter in duration so you don’t’ get as
much help from the Shield of Thistles. Also, if you have more than one
monster beating on you (bad news), the Shield gets even better damage/mana
ratios. This spell can also be cast on others, so it is an excellent spell
to buff your primary tank with if you are grouped.
<p>Update: The duration and effectiveness of this spell increase as your
skill increases. At 14<sup>th</sup> level it now does 7 damage combined
with Thistlecoat and it easily lasts through combat. I will even sometimes
sit and meditate for a few seconds to recover some of the mana cost by
casting the spell before I engage in combat. Still should be considered
a combat-duration buff spell however. There is no way you can effectively
keep this spell active all the time. Also as you start fighting 10<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup>
level monsters its just not feasible for you to melee with them. Getting
hit for 40pts of damage just so you can prick them for 7 pts isn't a good
trade. However, it remains an excellent spell to buff tanks and pets with
prior to combat.
<p>6) <b><u><font color="#808000">Strength of Earth</font></u></b>. A buff
spell that increases your STR by 10 pts (+1 per level above 14<sup>th</sup>).
I was initially hopeful that this would equate into a few more damage points
when I hit with my scimitar, but it does not seem to have that effect.
I still use it tho because it does allow me to carry more stuff without
getting encumbered. It lasts a good long time so only memorize it when
you need it.
<p>7) <b><u><font color="#808000">Endure Cold</font></u></b>. All I can
say about this spell is that it is a long lasting buff, so you can cast
it in your buff phase. I did not encounter a cold using creature while
I had it on so I cannot vouch for its efficacy.
<p>8) <b><u><font color="#808000">Invisibility to Animals</font></u></b>.
Still haven't purchased this spell to test its effects..
<p>9) <b><u><font color="#808000">Treeform</font></u></b>. This is a "fun"
spell. It turns you into a VERY large tree. A tree that can move, even
8-) Be careful moving around however, there is some problems with the graphics
engine that cause you to "fall through the cracks" of the landscape and
enter "the void" (those of you who played Daggerfall know what the void
is) Originally I was extremely excited about this because you can still
meditate while in Treeform. I thought it would be a cool way to safely
recover from combat and meditate. Unfortunately, I soon discovered that
monsters are not fooled by your foliage, and will still attack you (other
players see a monster flailing on a tree…pretty funny) That puts some extreme
limits on the usefulness of this spell. Once I was done playing around
with it, I never bothered to memorize it again. However I do theorize that
on the PvP server it might come in handy. Then again, if you want to PvP
successfully, you probably don’t want to be a Druid 8-)
<p>I haven’t yet purchased the other spells of this rank, which include
Enduring Breath (water breathing) and Starshine (I already have Infravision).
<p>As you can see the 3<sup>rd</sup> rank gives the Druid three pretty
useful buff spells. Casting these, plus Skin Like Wood, drains your mana
pretty good so you will have to meditate to recover before heading out.
Fortunately they all last long enough that this isn’t a big deal. You will
find that your survivability is dramatically enhanced if you use your spells
wisely.
<p>Alright, we are now at 14<sup>th</sup> level and a whole new rank of
spells is ours to command. Unlike 9<sup>th</sup> level when I was too poor
to buy many spells, I had enough money saved up to buy a good chunk of
the 4<sup>th</sup> rank spells immediately. So lets go through them:
<p>1) <b><u><font color="#808000">Spirit of Wolf</font></u></b>. Many players
will flat out say that this is the best spell in the game. I will not disagree.
It adds SIGNIFICANTLY to your overall speed. No longer can monsters run
you down! You will run circles around them. Better yet, groups which were
pretty indifferent to adding a Druid to their ranks now get considerably
more excited once they have been exposed to the benefits of SoW. This spell
probably adds more to your character's survivability than any other spell.
<p>Update: This spell has an extremely long duration, longer than any other
buff spell we have yet. It’s a good thing to because if you want to cast
it on yourself and several party members it takes the majority of your
mana. However it is an outdoor casting spell only. This isn't too big a
deal however as it is pretty easy to zone to an outdoor zone, cast the
spell, and then re-enter the indoor zone (typically a dungeon).
<p>2) <b><u><font color="#808000">Skin Like Rock</font></u></b>. An awesome
buff spell. True clerics might scoff as I get excited over its effects,
but I was VERY pleased when I saw this spell add 6 or 7 pts to my AC and
50 hit points to my total. Yes, that’s right, FIFTY. For me, that’s a 20%
increase in the number of HP my character has.
<p>Update: I verified that this spell is better (barely) than the Clerical
spell Center. Also, incredibly, this spell is stackable with Center, so
a party with a Cleric and Druid can Super-Buff the tanks.
<p>3) <b><u><font color="#808000">Bind Affinity</font></u></b>. Finally!
2 levels later than other classes, we Druids can finally change our home
points. Major expensive mana cost at 100 mana/casting. Note you can only
cast this on yourself and group members.
<p>4) <b><u><font color="#808000">Stinging Swarm</font></u></b>. A Damage
Over Time (DOT) spell. This is an awesome spell. This spell does about
120pts of damage (if you have your Conjuration skill maxxed) over about
a 30 second's worth of time when cast on myself. It only costs 65 mana
to cast, so the mana:damage ratio is very good. I suppose it makes up somewhat
for the lack of a burn spell at this rank. Combined with Spirit of Wolf
this spell is wonderfully effective. You can cast the spell on a monster
and lead it on a merry chase, stopping every 30 seconds or so to recast
it. It is absolutely essential that you max out your Conjuration skill
before you get serious about using this spell often however. At 80 Conjuration
skill it still fizzles 5-10% of the time.
<p>Note: The SoW and SS combination is a power gamers dream. If leveling
is your primary concern then this combo allows you to solo yellows and
reds (assuming they are within one or two levels of being yellow. Don'
think you can take out Hill Giants!). If I had wanted to exclusively power-level
from 14<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> level I could have done it over
one weekend. It does get very tedious however and I tended to wander off
and go exploring, so I only did 3 levels in 3 days (14<sup>th</sup> to
17<sup>th</sup>), which is still a pretty good pace.
<p>5) <b><u><font color="#808000">Cascade of Hail</font></u></b>. An Area
of Effect spell. Does about 60 damage over a span of 10 or 15 seconds.
Like Invoke Lightning the area of effect is very small and you need to
make sure the monsters are "shoulder-to-shoulder". Oddly enough the graphic
for the spell looks more like a rain of fire than it does a cascade of
hail. **shrug** It costs 62 mana to cast, so it is more mana efficient
that Invoke Lightning, but it takes much longer to recover from casting.
However, unlike lightning it is not an outdoor-only spell.
<p>6) <b><u><font color="#808000">Befriend Animals</font></u></b>. A charm
spell that lets you temporarily claim an animal as a pet. I was told that
the spell is useless because of its short duration, but I have to disagree
somewhat. It is true that it has a limited duration and it appears that
the tougher the animal, the shorter that duration is. When cast on green
conn’ing animals it lasts for a decent amount of time (typically long enough
to meditate your mana back and send the animal into combat). Blue conned
creatures can be charmed and immediately sent to attack. So far red animals
have either resisted or the spell lasted so briefly I couldn’t manage to
get them into combat before it wore off and they came after me. So rather
than saying the spell is useless, I will say is the 75 mana you have to
burn to get a temporary pet worth more than the damage you could dish out
using some other spell? The answer will depend on the situation. Remember
the value of a pet is not only defined by the damage they can do, but by
the fact that they are taking hits that you would otherwise take. With
this spell there is NO incentive to try and trade hits with your pet. Let
him soak up all the damage until it is dead (assuming you don’t give a
wit about role-playing that is…).
<p>Update: Griffons and their kin ARE considered animals and can be Charmed.
Let the fun begin…
<p>7) <b><u><font color="#808000">Summon Food/Drink</font></u></b>. Between
these spells and my Forage (70) skill I should never have to buy food supplies
again. The only caveat with these spells is that the summoned items disappear
when you log off. Excellent way to raise Conjuration. It only cost 10 mana
to cast.
<p>8) <b><u><font color="#808000">Levitate</font></u></b>. I finally purchased
and used this spell. Its not as useless as I was led to believe, but its
also not that great either. When cast you levitate about a foot off the
ground. You cannot control your levitation and go up further. It is not
a true D&amp;D levitate spell. It really is much more like a Feather Fall
spell. However I did have fun with it. You can go up on a high hill or
tower and "walk" off and "fly" for quite a ways. Your descent is very slow,
so if you leap from a tall enough structure you can sail for quite a ways.
It is possible to use this to get on top of buildings and other structures
that are otherwise unreachable. Note there does seem to be a bug in the
spell that **sometimes** prevents other characters from seeing you while
levitating. I have confirmed this twice now with two different people.
I could be right in front of them and they could not see me, even if they
looked up and around, I simply was not visible.
<p><b><u><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>Druid Thoughts</font></font></u></b>:
<p>04/13/99: A note on Indoors and Outdoors. As we all know, several Druid
spells become uncastable "indoors". This actually sounds much worse than
it plays in reality. I have noticed in Everquest that Indoors or Outdoors
is determined BY ZONE. In other words you do not have to worry about walking
around your favorite zone and then losing half your spells if you step
inside a building. If a zone is designated as outdoors then you can cast
your spells anywhere in that zone, even if you go inside a structure or
dungeon (as long as it doesn't load a new zone). Easy places to verify
this are the Minotaur caves in Steamfront and Black Burrow dungeon. Steamfront
of course is a large outdoor zone and the Minotaur caves are a small network
of caverns located within. The Druid does not lose any functionality adventuring
into these caves. Black Burrow dungeon is a zone unto itself but is considered
"outdoors". It doesn't matter if I delve all the way to the depths of Black
Burrow, I still have access to my entire repertoire of spells. However,
step into Splitpaw, and you do lose the ability to cast your outdoor-only
spells. I have not encountered many Indoor zones so far, and I've traveled
quite a bit in Feydwer and Antonica. The only Indoor zones I can recall
are Splitpaw and Befallen. The bottom line is just because you go inside
or deep below the ground, don't assume you lose the functionality of your
outdoor-only spells.
<p>04/12/99: Wow. Took a three day weekend and spent a significant amount
of time "power-leveling". Clipped along at a pace of 1 level/day, which
still allowed enough time for exploring/adventuring. The SoW and SS combo
is super-sweet. On a more annoying note I've had to switch my "Annonymous"
button on much of the time now. I typically don't like doing that, but
the requests for Spirit of Wolf get to be too much. Especially when you
are in power-gaming mode and don't want to "waste" mana. My current location
is in the Karanas, and people traveling from Qeynos to Freeport are desperate
for SoW to increase their chances. Most of the time I don't mind and view
it as an opportunity to make friends and collect "IOU's" for someday when
I might need them, but it can get to be too much.
<p>Any doubts I might have had before this weekend on SoW being the <b>Best
Spell In The Game</b> have been dispelled. People watched in awe as my
14<sup>th</sup> level character single-handedly killed Griffawns in the
Karanas. More than one adventurer lost their life as they tried to "help"
me out. They would see me fleeing like crazy from an enraged Griffawn,
not realizing that I was slowly killing it with Stinging Swarm, and step
up and try to distract it. Well they would distract it for about the 10
seconds it took for them to die, and then it was back after me =(. That’s
why I never ever help people in a combat unless they specifically ask me
or announce they need help somehow. When I need help I have a button hot-keyed
that I click like crazy that announces "Help me!! Help me!!" to anyone
close by. It has saved my life a number of times. Otherwise you can easily
disrupt an adventurer's well-laid plans to kill or bait a dangerous beast.
Of course letting someone die because they don't have "help me" hot keyed
may seem harsh, but it teaches them a valuable lesson that will help them
in the long run I think.
<p>04/08/99: When I first wrote up the spell descriptions I did not mention
which spells I kept in my eight memorized slots, so I will do that now.
Of course depending on your level and preferences your memorized spells
may be completely different, but here is what I have hot-keyed at various
stages. Also, this is for "combat mode" only. You should go into "buff
mode" whenever necessary and memorize all applicable buffing spells.
<p>11<sup>th</sup> level: 1) Snare, 2) Call Lightning, 3) Ignite, 4) Whirling
Wind, 5) Camouflage, 6) Shield of Thorns, 7) Light Healing, 8) Gate or
Ward Summoned, depending on if I’m fighting summoned creatures or not
<p>14<sup>th</sup> level: 1) Grasping Root, 2) Ignite, 3) Cascade of Hail,
4) Stinging Swarm, 5) Befriend Animal (still testing it), 6) Shield of
Thorns, 7) Camouflage, 8) Light Healing.
<p>17<sup>th</sup> level 1) Snare 2) Ignite 3) Stinging Swarm 4)Cascade
of Hail 5) Gate 6)Shield of Thorns 7) Camouflage 8) Light Healing
<p>04/07/99 Just a quick note on buff spells. As I haven’t played any other
class beyond 5<sup>th</sup> level, I can’t compare Druid buffs to any other
class, but it sure seems to me that Druids are super-buffers 8-). Now that
I’ve added 4<sup>th</sup> rank spells to my repertoire I regularly have
no less than 7 buff spells active at all times. Skin Like Rock, Thistlecoat,
Strength, FireFist, Endure Cold, Endure Fire, and Spirit of Wolf are now
frequently activated. I used to not worry about the Endure spells unless
I knew I was going after a spell casting creature, but a random encounter
with a desert madman changed my mind, and I now keep the Endure spells
active as well. If you include Camouflage and Shield of Thorns, that’s
NINE buff spells that I regularly cast. Unfortunately my downtime has increased
since casting all of these buffs drains about 4/5 of my mana, necessitating
a meditation session before I continue out. You will frequently hear fighter
types complaining that hit points regenerate so much slower than mana its
not fair, but they just don’t understand! Frequently I am sitting on my
butt after a tough combat restoring my depleted mana. As soon as I get
full mana I heal myself up, which could take two or three bars of mana
depending on how hurt I am, which necessitates another meditation session.
Then it seems all too often that I am just standing up from this second
meditation session when I notice my buffs starting to wear off! So I go
through the re-buffing process and sit back down again for awhile. Indeed
sometimes it takes three full meditation sessions after combat before I’m
all ready to go again 8-(. A fighter can heal a LOT of hit points during
that time. Then throw yourself into a group situation where you are expected
to heal the tanks and buff them as well, and you quickly realize why you
like to solo so much 8-)
<p>Also a note on your magic skills. Don’t be like me and ignore Conjuration
and Divination early on. Take the time to max every magic skill out at
every level. It will save you at 14<sup>th</sup> level from having to summon
10,000 flasks of water and loaves of bread, as I have to do 8-( just to
raise my Conjuration skill.
<p>04/05/99 I’m having a great time playing my character, Caer. Druids
really epitomize flexibility. I enjoy being able to add to a group in a
wide variety of ways. My burn spells really are just powerful enough to
be a nice addition to a group combat situation, my healing spells definitely
come in handy, and my ability to cure disease and poison is becoming increasingly
useful as we fight the tougher monsters. With Skin Like Rock, Strength,
and Spirit of Wolf, my buff spells are beloved by my party. However, the
fourth rank of spells does NOT have a new burn spell, so maybe the stretch
from 14<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> will be another tough one (although
there is NO WAY it can be as tough as 5<sup>th</sup> to 9<sup>th</sup>).
I got a feeling taking on 16<sup>th</sup> level monsters and only burning
them for 36 pts of Ignite damage is going to seem pretty inadequate. I
was shocked to discover this weekend that Wizards have a 3<sup>rd</sup>
rank burn spell that hits for 75+ damage. Nothing in the Druids arsenal
can compare with that, and it’s a big reason many parties do not extend
invitations to Druids when they need an extra burn specialist. There have
been several times I have been frustrated in a new zone when I advertise
that I would like to group, and even tho there were 60 - 100+ players in
the zone, I didn’t get a single offer. That’s pretty frustrating. However
those times are offset by the times I am successfully soloing and going
places no wizard would dare to go alone. I really believe that Druids are
the most solo-able class if you don’t include the "Pet" classes.
<p>This weekend I also went to Befallen for the first time. My immediate
reaction to the experience is "bleah". Druids are NOT good dungeoneers
(and I’m not saying they should be). Camo, Whirling Wind, and Invoke Lightning
all become useless indoors. I had open memorization slots for the first
time since 4<sup>th</sup> level 8-). I didn’t realize how much I would
miss Invoke Lightning. The Druid ability to blast a group of creatures
bunched up attacking your party members was sorely missed while I was in
the dungeon. I visited the dungeon twice, once I solo’d (nobody would invite
me to join) and the second time I went with a group of six. Neither time
was that fun. Without Camo, the Druid is a sitting duck while soloing,
and Befallen is full of Undead, which a Druid isn’t particularly effective
against anyway. With the group of six everything was fine, but travelling
with such a large group is a coordination nightmare as someone is always
AFK or running off without communicating. Plus it is EXTREMELY difficult
to target monsters when party members surround it. The Assist option works
ok unless there happens to be more than one NPC in the area, which forces
you to maneuver into the right spot first before you can target. The only
good thing I can say about the experience is that I didn’t die 8-). Also
I went to the Cauldron off of Steamfront Mountains. That is a very interesting
place if you like harsh climates and difficult terrain. However its no
place for 12-13<sup>th</sup> level characters to adventure, as the aqua
goblins are extremely deadly.
