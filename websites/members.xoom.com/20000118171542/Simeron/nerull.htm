<P><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold">History:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold">Nerull is rarely worshipped in
the open in dwarven society. As such, it is hard to tell how many worshippers
he has but, most tend to be thieves, assassins and murderers. His clergy
can call up many undead, are adept at necromancy spells (both clerical
and wizardly) and can become liches if they attain enough power. Of all
the dwarven gods, only Abbathor is on good terms with Nerull and even that
is strained as best. Cults of Nerull are hunted down with great dedication
among the dwarves and they place dwarven worshippers at the highest priority
to kill due to their "corruption" of the dwarven spirit and way of life.</FONT>
