<p>The Children of the Phoenix exists for only one simple purpose: To build and strengthen friendships.

<p>We are intentionally a relatively small guild, to give guild members more of a chance to know each other.  We are a tight-knit and supportive guild, assisting both guildmates and strangers as best we can.  We are a guild that encourages kindness, tolerance, and creativity.

<p>We have both powergamers and roleplayers, both hopeless addicts and casual players, both good and evil characters, and members from all over the world.  We have high-level members who've been playing since Beta alongside low-level members who just picked up the game recently.  We have members with two, three, or even all eight of their characters in the guild, and we have members with characters split across several guilds and servers.

<p>We have good friends in many other guilds who we can turn to for help, and who can come to us for assistance.  We are at war with no other guilds, nor will we ever be.  We are gentle and open with those who respect us, but we are also harsh with those who disrespect, harass, or belittle us or others around us.

<p>Sometimes we group and hunt, sometimes we solo, and sometimes we relax and blather. Sometimes we roleplay our characters out, and sometimes we're just ourselves. Our few constants are that we're always enjoying ourselves, and we're always willing to help others. If someone seeks help from a member of the Children, they should know they're in good hands.

<p>We are friends always.

<p>Our guild laws are few and simple:<ul>
<li><em><strong>Be considerate.</strong></em><ul><li>Don't kill-steal.  Don't insult or harass other players.  Don't lose your perspective on the game.  Remember this, always: the other characters in the game are people too, and your in-game actions will produce real-world responses.  At the same time, this does not mean we are meek and submissive; we can and will swiftly respond to injuries to ourselves and our friends.</ul>
<li><em><strong>Help others when possible.</strong></em><ul><li>Heal or bandage the wounded if you can spare the mana or items.  Guide people around cities if they're lost and you're free.  Help people find and recover their corpses.</ul>
</ul>

<p>Our guild structure is simple, as well:<ul>
<li><em><strong>Children of the Phoenix</strong></em><ul><li>All members are Children of the Phoenix, and therefore brothers and sisters to each other.  As the phoenix of myth finds its rebirth and immortality in flames and embers, so do the Children find their immortality in the minds and hearts of their guildmates and friends.</ul>
<li><em><strong>High Guard</strong></em><ul><li>The members of the High Guard form the ruling council of the Guild. The Morninglord is the de facto head of the High Guard, but decisions are made as a group. If the Morninglord should decide to pass his or her position on to another, it is the High Guard who will choose a successor.</ul>
<li><em><strong>Morninglord</strong></em><ul><li>The Guildmaster. The Morninglord leads and guides the guild, acts as the final arbiter of any dispute, and invites Children to become part of the High Guard.</li>
