Description:<P>
AQHA weanling filly - that has a white spot on her side! It doesn't have any pink skin under it and with the new AQHA white rule - she will have regular papers. She's a sweet little filly and would make a terrific all-around kindof horse.  Her sire, Scotchs Seven has WP & HUS points but also has sired rope horses, reiners, all around youth horses and halter horses.  Her mother is out of an AQHA Champion who had points in 8 events and her mother's sire was also an AQHA Champion with multiple events. She's bred to do it!  She's halter broke, broke to tie, has had her feet trimmed and is ready to go to a new home! I need the space so she's bargain priced! She's also eligible for the Missouri Futurities if that's your deal!  DNA typed as well.  And she has a current coggins.  Excellent prospect!<BR>Contact Laurie Burbank @ 660-258-5420 or e-mail laurieburbank@hotmail.com<BR><BR>[Ad edited by Laurieburbank on December 08, 2004 10:42 AM]
