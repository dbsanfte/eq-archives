    Teroth Castille</big></font><br>
    </big></big><font face="Arial"><br>
    Recently, I attended a raid upon the lair of <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3283" style="color: rgb(0,128,128)">Lord Nagafen</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
    a Necromancer, my job was vague at best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Providing
    some buff spells that were sure to be dispelled by the mighty dragon so that the spell
    effects of other buff spells would remain was the first part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Supplying other casters and clerics with mana was
    part two, and sending my pet off to attack ole Naggy was part three.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">All was going well, but we seemed a bit light on
    forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trusting in my raid leader, I was
    ready for a heated (no pun intended) battle.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon
    the attack was launched, and the warriors charged forward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Next was the casters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Landing a
    spell on Lord Nagafen is darn near impossible for a Necromancer, so I was jogging back and
    forth to heal and mana pump as I could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon
    the warriors, shadowknights and monks started dropping, and the healers were being
    summoned by the Lord of Fire to meet their deaths in the lava pits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, I had cast Dead Man Floating on them
    and they remained above the damage of the lava.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    the dragon also has very sharp claws, and they were torn to bits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p>The casters were next, and I knew my moment of
    death was upon me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a quiet stillness
    that comes from wanting only to hurt your foe before you die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps it is because you have accepted your
    death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe it is tension of the moment,
    allowing you to see each second as it passes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, my pet was still alive and swinging and I knew I had time to make Lord Nagafen
    pay for my death.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I quickly launched into a
    spell casting furor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One spell resisted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> &nbsp; </span>Two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Three.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lord Nagafen is burned with acid!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Success!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Midway
    through the next spell casting my pet died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p>Assuming that I was next, I interrupted my casting
    at the same time I was summoned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tearing
    through my Steelskin, Lord Nagafen attacked with the absolute certainty that I would die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just as the magical barrier dropped, I was able to
    put up another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Impenetrable but taxing as it
    was, I knew I could not maintain it for long and decided to put some distance between me
    and the dragon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just as my barrier dropped, I
    began to feign death in hopes of fooling the beast into thinking he had already done me
    in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was summoned to his feet and destined
    to be his next meal.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p>Perhaps it was that quiet stillness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps it was my secret desire to survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What ever it was, I was glad for it because I was
    able to maintain my concentration and finish the spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Immediately, the dragon lost interest in me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>He saw me as just one more corpse for snacking on later and moved deeper
    into his lair.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At this point, I lay there
    undecided.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Do I run now or wait for help?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Looking down at the bodies around me, I began to
    drag them to a safe spot for a cleric to undo Naggy&#146;s handiwork.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Several trips later, Naggy saw my efforts and
    roared his disapproval.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By this time I had
    recovered my energy and was able to pull off the same trick as before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now it was 4 times that he had attempted to kill
    me and I had survived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps this is a
    sign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe I just got lucky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can decide for yourself, but I like to think I
    am just that damn good!</font></p>

        day in Iceclad as I trudged through the knee deep snow making my way past the gnoll camp
        toward the distant tower. The Tower of Frozen Shadows it was called by the locals, or TOFS
        for short. I had never been there before, but the guild leader of Dragonchow had called
        for a raid upon it and I was answering that call. I had also never been on a raid before. <br>
        <br>
        All I knew of raids was what I heard over the guild speak channel on Friday nights.
        Usually the great Warlord Radalas was barking orders while others were reporting mana
        levels. It all sounded very exciting, but I was always too young to join. This time
        however Swifthand had called for a 30-40 level assault on TOFS, and I was eager to be
        apart of it. Not only would this be my first guild organized assault, it would also be my
        first meeting with many of the legendary names of Dragonchow.<br>
        <br>
        I reached the tower under the cover of invisibility. It was a bit dank and drab inside,
        but I was out of the wind at least. In the tower&#146;s antechamber I found my wife
        Sarenia, the 36<sup>th</sup> level Erudian Enchantress, and MrPain, the 36<sup>th</sup>
        level Iksar Warrior. Now, having done some research about the guild I knew MrPain, was
        also none other than Teroth Castille the Duke of Dragonchow, (our sovereign&#146;s
        brother). We sat together in the cold flagstone awaiting the others, while Sarenia made
        small talk, or flirted with MrPain, I honestly can&#146;t tell the difference anymore. It
        wasn&#146;t long before His Lordship Swifthand Silvereyes entered and stood upon the stone
        dais above us and observed the assembled troops. He left swiftly (perhaps it was the
        source of his name) muttering something about getting a cleric. Then, unseen, and
        unannounced I turned to find a human beside me clad in silver armor, with a bushy brown
        mustache. It was Radalas the Great, hero of Kael. I immediately bowed before him, when I
        noticed someone from the Allegiance of Faith had also arrived and was sitting quietly in
        the shadows. His name was Salfadorn a high level cleric. <br>
        <br>
        </font><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Swifthand returned and with him came
        Medikar, and Dharius, a 29<sup>th</sup> level cleric. It was then that the King explained
        his intent. He was forming a 30-40 level group to fight in the tower as a training
        exercise, while having the higher level guild members standing by as our safely net for
        when we got ourselves in trouble. It was important that we newbies learned the proper art
        of group play for when we get old enough to join the true raids. Soon Drukinpinoch, a 36<sup>th</sup>
        level shadowknight arrived and we began fighting. Our intent was to obtain the first key
        that would allow us access through the mirror (portal), to the next level up. At first we
        were sloppy, at least I was. Cramped quarters, and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>lots
        of mobs made it hard to determine how best to assist the group. It didn&#146;t take long
        before we had two sets of keys, and off we went to the second level. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>This was the library. Several ghostly
        students were busy at their desks scribbling away, and when we arrived the librarian
        seemed upset and told us so by attacking. Poor MrPain held her off while<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I nuked and Dharius healed, and Sarenia kept the
        rest at bay. We fell into a better rhythm here, until Swifthand pulled the whole room at
        once causing Salfadorn (I think, or perhaps Saladar made a cameo appearance) to cast a
        powerful spell killing the entire lot at once. This happened a few times and resulted in a
        net value of one blue bub per area nuke.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Dharius obtained the teacher&#146;s
        Syllubus, as did I and Sarenia managed to get one of the student&#146;s homework (all nice
        caster items), but then things went deadly. Sarenia was singled out by one of the ghosts
        and killed. In attempting to help her I gained the agro and was being slaughtered. Dharius
        attempted to help but was killed himself before he could. All three of us died in short
        order. We were all quickly resurrected however, an interesting experience&#151;Sarenia had
        never been rezzed before and I only once. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Despite gaining tremendous experience, and
        three nice items, it was then decided that we should do something truly insa&#133;I mean
        challenging. We were going directly to the top of the tower and face <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5604" style="color: rgb(128,128,255)">Tserrina&#146;s</a> power openly. This was where my life
        took a bad turn, or perhaps more accurately I turned the wrong way. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>We exited the tower and appeared at the base
        amidst a handful of stone guardians, little spinning tornados of rocks that hit for about
        60 points of damage. Everyone had bolted away very quickly, while I stood hesitating my
        next move. I had a fifty fifty chance I figured. The door back into the tower, the safety
        of a zone was only a short distance away, but which way, left or right? Sarenia shouted
        for me to go left. (assuming I was facing the tower, problem was, I was facing away from
        the tower.) I turned left and began running around the base picking up more and more stone
        tornados as I ran, thinking the door had to be there any second. My seconds ran out
        however, and my spirit left my body. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>I was dead for quite sometime as Radalas and
        Swifthand search for my corpse. I was hearing various reports and chatter about feeding my
        body to the Gnolls and Iksars finding Euridan tastes remarkably well. I became really
        concerned when they announced they did not have enough pieces left to resurect. &nbsp;
        Sarenia began her search for a new husband and set her eyes on Indra but Purti said he was
        taken.&nbsp; Finally I was found and resurrected. I appeared at my body at the base of the
        tower, with Switfy and Rad on either side of me. I immediately looted. No sooner had I
        finished than I was attacked by more of the same whirling stones. I noticed that Swifty
        had dragged my corpse and I was now standing right in front of the door. All I needed to
        do was take two steps and zone. When I tried to move however, I was unable. I was so weak
        from being mostly dead, I couldn&#146;t even managed the two steps. I had a beard with
        Storm Giant&#146;s strength and tried firing that off to boost me enough to fall into the
        door, but it failed to free me. I died shortly there after, and can still hear
        Swifthand&#146;s mournful cry in my dead ears as he yelled, &#147;NO!&#148;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>My spirit remained in the ether, nether land
        for quite some time. It was during this time that Drukinpinoch and Dharius left us though
        I don&#146;t know why or how. I watched the clouds passing by, for quite sometime and
        began to grow concerned&#151;something wasn&#146;t right. I started to feel a desire to go
        into the light, when I was finally resurrected. This time I looted, and as soon as I could
        move dove into the door. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Back inside the tower&#146;s anteroom I
        learned the tragic news</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&#147;Sorry
        it took so long,&#148; Swifty/Medikar said when we were safely inside once more &#147;I
        was busy at the time, I had to resurrect a 60<sup>th</sup> level warrior.&#148;
        &nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We all looked at Radalas in horror. What
        happened - we were all amazed for what could destroy our 60th level hero. &quot;About 12
        to15 dervishes&quot;.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&#147;They all must die,&#148; Rad grumbled
        venomously with a grim look on his face.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">We dusted ourselves off and there were a few
        moments where we looked for new, higher level recruits to help us tackle the top of the
        tower. Soon we were off once more. We reached a new mirror and no key we had worked, but
        now a new guild member joined us. Crymrych a shape shifting Dwarven rogue made quick work
        of picking the lock and suddenly we were all on the top level of the tower. We fought for
        a brief time, killing a few bats, then we were ordered to go invisible and follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> &nbsp; </span>We walked along a treacherous polished stone
        parapet to the right side was a spiral staircase; to the other was a sheer drop. To my
        shock Medikar and Radalas jumped off. <br>
        <br>
        &#147;But isn&#146;t there a stair?&#148; I started to say, when out of fear of losing the
        group I jumped as well seriously twisting my ankle at the bottom. Off we went again, this
        time down a narrow corridor with arched openings on either side. I was bringing up the
        rear (no doubt due to the pain in my ankle), when my invis dropped unexpectedly. I was
        attacked. Several bat swarmed me at once, apparently they have a fondness for Erudian
        blood. In retrospect I should have stopped and died in the corridor, but not realizing the
        power of the bats, and perhaps over estimating the prowess of my comrades, I ran to them
        assuming they would make quick work of the cute little rats with wings. Indeed when I
        heard Radalas shout, &#147;DIE ELD!&#148; I thought he it was calling a warning to the
        others that I was in trouble and needed help, when in fact he really wanted me to drop
        dead. Not clear on the situation I didn&#146;t understand, but I would soon learn. <br>
        <br>
        By bringing the bats into the otherwise safe room, I lead the death parade for my party.
        One after another they dropped, death and carnage was everywhere. Sarenia died next, and
        Radalas, MrPain and Crymrych fought valiantly, side by side in a suicide battle that
        managed to buy Medikar the precious few moments he needed to camp out. I must say I was
        very impressed with the teamwork, skill and courage displayed in that desperate hour. More
        was to come. <br>
        <br>
        Once more I found myself hovering in limbo watching the clouds and listening to the
        chatter of my loved ones in the guild.&nbsp; Purti was in a group somewhere and frustrated
        with her Cleric.&nbsp; Apparently he had taken up pulling and was neglecting is healing
        responsibilites.&nbsp; Mirer and Purti had an ongoing conversation how there should be no
        &quot;battle clerics&quot; and the disasters that becomes of them.&nbsp; <br>
        </font></p>
        <p><img src="images/tofs2.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="576" HEIGHT="432"><font face="Arial">Ironically
        during this conversation Medikar came back into the tower.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone and lacking
        mana he faced a vampire from the bat that was slain by the group before they all
        died.&nbsp; Alone he waged a battle while we from our external vantages gave him
        encouragement and moral support.&nbsp; Minutes seemed like hours while we awaited the fate
        of our last remaining survivor.&nbsp; Finally news - &quot;It's going to be close&quot;
        &nbsp; we heard him say - we held our breath.&nbsp; Victory&nbsp; at last.&nbsp; Sarenia
        shoulted across the guild &quot;Medikar is the mightest battle cleric!&quot;&nbsp; Purti
        replied &quot;Please tell me you are kidding.&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Well there were unusually
        circumstances&quot;.&nbsp; Sarenia replied.&nbsp; We could all now breath again.&nbsp; In
        time we were all resurrected by Medikar, and clustered in the tower. <br>
        <br>
        We now found ourselves in a small empty room.&nbsp; Radalas would go out and pull in a
        bat.&nbsp; Battle would rage on for what seemed like hours Sarenia and I would do our
        feeble small parts but the bulk of the battle on this level was clearly in the hands of
        our more experienced brethern.&nbsp; Finally a bat died only to bring forth a vampire.
        &nbsp; More fighting and healings and eventually it too died.&nbsp; A single battle with
        one took what seemed like 10 minutes although it probably could have been just a 3 or 5 in
        any case it became clear why I was commanded to die.&nbsp; Doing one was very difficult
        when we had 8 - 12 of course we could not survive.<br>
        <br>
        Several more battles raged on and then about this time Drukinpinoch requested to rejoin
        us. I thought back on the trials and deaths that got us up there, and wondered, how on
        earth would that be managed. It couldn&#146;t be, and we had to carry on without him.<br>
        <br>
        </font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><img src="images/tofs3.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="576" HEIGHT="432"><font face="Arial">Radalas
        gave some quick instructions on the do&#146;s an don&#146;ts of facing Tserrina. Tserrina
        is the queen of the tower, a nasty vampiress with 100 percent resistance to magic, and a
        bad attitude. We began to think of her as Sarenia's evil twin.&nbsp; Rad began pulling
        bats, which spawned vampires at their deaths. My job was to snare the vamps and avoid
        aggros while nuking. At last I seemed to get the hang of this, although none of my snares
        held. Then to my surprise I DINGED 38, and lo and behold the snares began to work. <br>
        <br>
        At last a bat exploed and out came the dreaded Tserrina.&nbsp; Knowing we could do little
        agains her Sarenia and I did what little we could.&nbsp; Sarenia would add damage shields
        and speed buffs to the melee fighters and add a rune here and there only to be eaten away
        by a single hit from the dreaded beast.&nbsp; Suddenly Sarenia went linkdead I did all
        that I could - cast my feeble O&#146;keils, damage shield on the fighters. The battle was
        long and hard, with Salfadorn, and Medikar casting heals. Eventually she fell with a
        hideous cry. A moment later Sarenia reappeared. <br>
        <br>
        I&#146;m back, did I miss anything?&#148;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Tserrina&nbsp; dropped her staff, and it was unanimously decided that Sarenia should
        receive it. Eventually Medikar had to leave to wrap presents for his daughters birthday.
        &nbsp; He left us in Radalas capable hands and we continued to do battle.&nbsp; As the
        hours wained on Radalas annonced that after the next 3 bats he would be leaving.&nbsp; We
        killed the first two and now we were down to the final battle of the night.&nbsp; <br>
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><br>
        We waited as the last bat got lower and lower in health.&nbsp; Sarenia yelled out
        &quot;Come on evil sister be there, be there&quot;.&nbsp; The bat died and once again we
        were faced with Tserrina's evil wrath.&nbsp; Once again the epic battle was waged our
        brave guildmates pounded the evil queen and once again Sarenia went Linkdead.&nbsp; Just
        as before only minutes after the evil queen died - in pops Sarenia.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        I'm back, did I miss anything again?&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Coincidence perhaps. But perhaps Sarenia and Tserrina cannot exist in the same plane
        together. Hoping for a robe but instead we got her necklace. Most of the guild was
        unimpressed but it was a far cry better than anything that Eldeberon and Sarenia presntly
        had so we were grateful for the gift. With that we called it a night with one last port by
        myself for the group to the dreadlands. <br>
        <br>
        In conclusion, TOFS was a wonderful time, at least speaking for myself and Sarenia. We
        both gained a level each, and learned much about teamwork in general. Sarenia also managed
        to walk away with a nice new necklace, the powerful staff of Teserenia and the
        Student&#146;s homework, while I had acquired the teacher&#146;s syllabus, which filled an
        empty slot in my inventory. Mostly however, and more importantly, it was just a whole lot
        of fun.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have now been on three forays
        into the Tower of Frozen Shadow (TOFS) in Iceclad, and I think I am finally starting to
        understand what goes on there. I know, with 209 intelligence and a head as tall as the
        Highhold Pass cliff, you'd think I'd catch on quicker, but I am still a relative newbie to
        the guild. Regardless, for good or ill, right or wrong, this is what I have concluded from
        my experiences in the haunted tower. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To begin with ToFS's is a death trap. It has
        multiple mobs that swarm and few ways out. The few exits that do exists port you outside
        the tower where hungry snow dervishes are waiting in droves to pummel you. Because of the
        key system, if you die you might never be able to claim your body. As a result TOFS is a
        VERY scary place. As such it is the prefect place to scare the cr -- I mean,
        &quot;train&quot; new DC recruits on tactics and group play. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dragonchow has, in point of fact, been using
        ToFS's as a training ground. The idea is to take mid-level members, who may, or may not
        have had much experience with grouping or raiding, and hone their skills to a quality
        where they will be an asset to a &quot;real&quot; guild raid, rather than a hindrance. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The technique is to have two groups, one
        high-level and one mid-level. The high level is there only to support the mid-level in he
        event of emergency (and no doubt to obtain a good belly laugh at the sorry antics of the
        less experienced). The mid-level group is designed to be comprised with proper melee,
        caster, healer elements and then let loose on the second floor to fight as they wish. The
        high-level group watches the action and offer helpful suggestions as to how we can improve
        our performance. I have always found their suggestions to be considerate and politely
        delivered, (which I am very impressed with considering the political delicacy needed to
        offer advice without sounding like &quot;Hey! What are you an idiot! How did you get to
        level 40 pulling that crap!&quot; ) and, for me at least, very helpful -- as I rarely
        group with melees and needed the advice. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once the mid group gets a rhythm down, and
        initial rough edges are smoothed, it is time to take on a greater challenge. I do believe
        Radalas, (who was part of two of the TOFS adventures I have been on), has something of the
        &quot;sadistic prankster&quot; in his nature. With the intent of preparing the new
        recruits (perhaps a poor choice of term as some of the mid-level players have high level
        mains who have been in DC for some time now, but you get my drift), to be able to face the
        worst case scenario Radalas has purposely trained us with a horde of ghostly students--and
        I mean a train! I believe he has pulled the entire library on us before. Radalas' version
        of the Cobiashi Maru test. Keep in mind he has several high level clerics standing by to
        give full rezzes if anyone dies. Although it might appear that way, he's not <i>totally</i>
        insane. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This last Sunday DC held a Training Raid on
        ToFS. Sylen was the leader of the raid. It was his first time as leader and I believe
        Radalas was providing him guidance. So we newbies, were being lead by a raw lieutenant
        into the dreadful tower. Sylen, I felt did a great job, albeit he seemed a tad under
        confident, apologizing for delay and poor organization, but honestly I felt he was doing
        fine. I have run small groups myself and understand the insane difficulties involved in
        getting everyone in order in a timely fashion. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ToFS always seems to start in chaos. I say it
        &quot;seems&quot; to, but appearances can be deceiving. There is no organization on the
        first floor because none is needed. The high level members busy themselves killing the
        mobs to obtain the keys needed, while the rest are waiting for the late comers to arrive.
        The newbies feel confused because they have little to do and no direction, but that soon
        changes, and I was relieved when Sylen began to announce teams. I rather felt like I was
        back in school being picked for dodgeball. As usual I was picked last and then switched
        between teams (lol). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/tofsrevisited2.jpg" align="left" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="335">We went to the second floor, where we practiced pulling a few and had no
        problem at all. So we quickly moved on to the third floor. We fought there until we had
        such a good rhythm it was getting boring. Radalas must have realized this, or maybe
        &quot;he&quot; was just getting bored-still I like to think Rad honestly was trying to
        strengthen our sense of self-confidence and force us to learn how to act in dire peril. It
        is, after all, far better to practice proper defensive procedures when you have an army of
        high level clerics standing by than when you are without a safety net. So it was Radalas'
        intent to push us to the limit. He began by training the ghosts from the second level up
        to us. He failed however bringing but one measly student. So he then came up with a
        nastier plan. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He proposed that we all go up to the fourth
        floor, an area that I think, Rad thought, we were incapable of holding at our level. So we
        all went up, but Rad (I assume) secretly ordered that the high-level group would remain
        behind. He abandoned us purposely to see if we would sink or swim. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The moment we all arrived and none of the
        high-level party did, Sarenia and I knew what was going on. It was obvious and not
        altogether unexpected. Still things got very tense. I don't know what Rad was thinking
        exactly, I haven't had the opportunity to discuss his intent or expectations but I suspect
        he was looking to see if members would panic, run, gate, abandon comrades, freeze up, etc.
        After we all died I am sure he would have resurrected us all and perhaps then explained
        what we did wrong and how we could have done things better. However that was not the case.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the astonishment of all, we few, we proud,
        we brave little Dragonchows stood our ground. We zoned in and faced wave after wave of
        pops, and held them off in cool, courageous fashion. Few, if any of us, had ever been to
        this level (I know Sarenia, Cabbz and I had not), and had no idea what to expect and yet
        every one of us acted in perfect teamwork. The invisible shadows were a big surprise. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pawur, the ogre shadowknight, stood steadfast
        before us fending off the onslaught! Jaszire, the shaman, stood beside him clubbing with
        his staff. Sarenia, the enchantress, cast rapid fire mez and stuns to keep the hounds at
        bay. I, the wizard, timed my nukes to avoid agros and wiped out the berserk stage of the
        fight. Cabbz, the shaman, healed, buffed and defuffed, and occasionally joined the melee.
        Tanjure, our cleric, adeptly kept us all alive with heals. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When at last the others joined us, we showed
        hardly a scratch, as we sat around a massive pile of undead corpses. Rad was impressed I
        think, and perhaps a bit disappointed to.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I can't kill you guys,&quot; he told
        us, &quot;You're just too good!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which left us all feeling pretty damn proud I
        think.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was getting late then and we all called it
        a night, a night without a single death. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So if you ever decide to take TOFS 101 with
        professor Radalas, keep in mind you will learn a lot, assuming the lesson doesn't kill
        you. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks to all who came and helped with this
        training exercise. Special thanks to Exavier, Lindsay, Scalezz, and Sylen, who sacrificed
        their time to do little more than play nurse maid to the rest of us. And thanks to Rad
        whose failure to kill us really made the night great. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We really need to get T-Shirts made up that
        say, &quot;Dragonchows Rule!&quot;, hard part is getting Verant to texture them onto our

                <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So Eldeberon 
                  and I awake in the cold icy snows of Eastern Wastes.&nbsp; It 
                  was a hard night battling the dreaded Rygor Elites the night 
                  before and if it wasn't for the fact that they kept out numbering 
                  us they would all be dead.&nbsp; We fought side by side with 
                  our old friend Cabbaz who we are still trying to get into Dragonchow 
                  (He has a standing offer at a guild of RL friends and we are 
                  trying to lure him away from that).</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eldeberon has been 
                  enjoying quad kiting Ulthorks but since I have little to do 
                  in that but collect up the experience and a few tusks here and 
                  there I was not up for it.&nbsp; When Eldeberon mentioned Crystal 
                  Caverns I jumped at the opportunity.<br>
        <br>
        Now don't get me wrong I love my jboots (in a purely practical way) they are not
        fashionable but they do allow me to run fast and it was such a grueling experience to get
        them.&nbsp; Still I wanted something more fitting for my feet something pretty and
        delicate -- I wanted crystal slippers and Crystal Caverns held just the big bad spider who
        would give them to me.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
                  We had just arrived at the site when we got a tell from Cabbz 
                  -&quot; what were we up to?&quot;, &quot;Hunting spiders in 
                  CC&quot; was our reply.&nbsp; &quot;Need any help?&quot;.&nbsp; 
                  I respond &quot;Well only if it is the right kind of help - 
                  did you get a tell from Crisbie that he is coming?&quot;&nbsp; 
                  This is a long running gag with us Crisbie is by far one of 
                  the worst and most immature players we've ever had the displeasure 
                  of grouping with and he has been the butt of our jokes for a 
                  long time.&nbsp; &quot;Of course we want you along - come on 
                  down&quot; and shortly we were joined with our dear friend.<br>
        <br>
                  We worked the hallway and although the shear number of spiders 
                  was overwhelming we did quite well and were able to clear it 
                  and keep it clear without too much trouble. &nbsp; Finally it 
                  was all clear and we peaked in the room.&nbsp; There is the 
                  queen surrounded by 4 minions.&nbsp; Ah certain death but I 
                  know she has my shoes so we start to plot strategies. &nbsp; 
                  A plan is hatched where I attempt to mez her and run most of 
                  the mobs to the dwarf town leaving Cabbz and Eldeberon to mop 
                  up the queen.&nbsp; It will most certainly mean death but we 
                  might take her with us.&nbsp; Finally we decide we need help 
                  and turn to our guild.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A quick glance shows no one 
                  in our zone or anywhere near it.&nbsp; Shoot! we are on our 
                  own.&nbsp; Then Eldeberon sends a tell to Freyana - All he says 
                  is Sarenia and Eldeberon need some help and without inquiring 
                  any further she responds &quot;OMW&quot;.&nbsp; Once again we 
                  are amazed and impressed by the generosity of the home we now 
                  call guild.&nbsp; She is all the way on the moon but drops what 
                  she is doing comes to Thurg for a bind then meets up with us 
                  at the spiders.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By this time we have to clear hall trash
        again and we do it easily.&nbsp; Then two escape and head for the queen and Freyana jumps
        in the water to finish them off.&nbsp; Unfortunately we got an unexpected argo and the
        next thing we knew the queen and countless spiders had descended upon us.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The battle ensued 
                  and although we fought desperately we did not have time to prepare 
                  and it looked grim.&nbsp; The Queen was dead and Freyana was 
                  able to loot the corpse but not before dying herself.&nbsp; 
                  In the end Eldeberon, Cabbz and Freyana lay dead and I only 
                  escaped by a gate at the last moment. &nbsp; Now I have to live 
                  with the guilt.&nbsp; I survived while my comrades fell. &nbsp; 
                  Not only that but I had dragged Freyana away for assistance 
                  and got her killed in the process.&nbsp; Needless to say I felt 
                  terrible.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the good side 
                  there was a very nice Cleric next door at the geos who was more 
                  than willing to help us out, and a short time later we had 3 
                  rezzes and were back at it again.&nbsp; About this time we noticed 
                  another DC in the zone. Kendrick had just popped in and we asked 
                  if he would like to join.&nbsp; He did and now we were poised 
                  to do some serious damage which we did.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We laid waste to 
                  the area. Spider bodies stacked up like cord wood. The queen 
                  and here other high level arachnids died left and right.&nbsp; 
                  Between Freyana's Mana song and my Clarity we were always at 
                  full mana and nothing stood in our way.&nbsp; Several queens 
                  were killed but no shoes still we were having fun with good 
                  comrades.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suddenly while we 
                  were cleaning up some yard trash a monk runs by.&nbsp; When 
                  our battle is done I look into the room and there he is KS'ing 
                  our queen.&nbsp; How rude I thought and we started a conversation 
                  with him. &nbsp; Soon the whole zone chimes in that he has been 
                  KS'ing their areas as well. &nbsp; His name is Fosgate and a 
                  member of the Guardians of Light. The conversation wages on 
                  in ooc and it is apparent that this guy although high level 
                  has the mindset of a newbie wanting only self gratification 
                  and no thought or care for others or a sense of &quot;nice play&quot;.&nbsp; 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such behavior should 
                  not go unchecked. &nbsp; Freyana finds an officer in the guild 
                  and reports him.&nbsp; I also speak to Morloc (the officer) 
                  that he should have a talk with Mr. Fosgate since he obviously 
                  needs to be taught better manners than he showed.&nbsp; Morloc 
                  asks me if I can get to a Wizzy spire sometime that night - 
                  &quot;Yes I can but why I ask?&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&quot;I'll 
                  give you your glass slippers.&quot; &nbsp;he says.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now at first I'm impressed that this guild
        member will make good on bad done by a member of his guild.&nbsp; But then I think it is
        not his responsibility to clean up after another's mess.&nbsp; I thank him for his kind
        offer but inform him the loot is not the point.&nbsp; The point is how unenjoyable Fosgate
        made this evening for me, my teammates, and several other people in the zone.&nbsp; I
        politely decline his offer though thank him for the sentiment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Morloc informs me I'm not the first to
        complain about Fosgate - then why don't you boot him I say.&nbsp; He says he has no proof
        so what can he do.&nbsp; I offer to send him a copy of the log I turned on as the
        conversation became unpleasant.&nbsp; He gives me his e-mail.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With that excitement done we continue to kill
        Kendrick brings in his monk. Too young to receive experience but she had a good time
        whacking on spiders with Freyana.&nbsp; They were like two women killing machines putting
        the best of any male melee to shame.&nbsp; By 2:00 am we got our last queen pop. &nbsp;
        Still&nbsp; no slippers but overall a good time had by all (With the exception of Mr.
        Fosgate who I plan to be &quot;watching&quot; in the future and doing what I can to expand
        his reputation to those around him to see him for what he truly is an immature and selfish
        little man). We picked up 3 crystaline robes, a web shield, a spider fur choker, the
        queens pally weapon, and lots of runes, gems and pages to keep Eldeberon and myself busy.
        &nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So in conclusion I would like to thank
        Freyana and Kendrick/Kixim for their assistance although we did not get the shoes I got to
        spend time with some guild mates I've not fought with before and I enjoyed your company
        and your skills.&nbsp; Also thanks to Cabbz who is always a welcome pleasure to any group
        I have with him.&nbsp; If you see him about tell him how great&nbsp; DC is and that he has
        to join up.&nbsp; And if you happened to See Fosgate in a zone warn those around you to
        beware and be ready to /ignore - he can be quite annoying, although the other /ooc's to
        him are quite entertaining.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well that's it for me until next time. &nbsp;
        I bid you farewell.</font></p>

                  up in Burning Woods, near the Skyfire pass, we prepared to do 
                  battle. The first run at ole Ixi was with 65 people of 50th 
                  level or higher. The first pull was long and arduous as Leifanng 
                  pulled the giant elemental to the camp. Shouting 'Here I come' 
                  and 'Party Time' rang out several times as she made her way 
                  to us. Soon the beast was in sight. </font></p>
