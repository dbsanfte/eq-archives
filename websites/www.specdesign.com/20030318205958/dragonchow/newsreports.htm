          Balance</font></b></font></p>

          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's been clear for awhile 
          now that priests and casters haven't been as well balanced as we'd all 
          like them to be. Balance is a delicate issue and any major changes to 
          overall class power are always researched, debated, and taken slowly. 
          There are some really big improvements in the works now for helping 
          out with that balance, and we expect those to be on the Test server 
          in the near future. These changes won't all come in one huge patch, 
          but will show up a bit at a time until casting classes are right where 
          they should be in relative power. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are taking the needs and 
          issues of casters seriously, and we think you'll be very happy with 
          the results you see after we finish our caster balance effort. We hope 
          you'll be patient just a bit longer, while we take the time to get everything 
          implemented, balanced, and tested.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ancient Spells </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One specific area we are 
          addressing for casting classes revolves around how much improvement 
          they get from raiding and acquiring high-level items. When a melee class 
          begins to acquire items from the hardest monsters, they experience a 
          tremendous growth in power. A melee character sporting Vulak weapons 
          and Temple of Veeshan loot is incredibly more powerful than player who 
          only owns average quality items. Casting classes don't achieve nearly 
          the same amount of increased power from raid items, and rapidly fall 
          behind melees in relative power when they start raiding. It doesn't 
          make sense for a wizard who has helped in slaying hundreds of dragons 
          to be using the same spells as someone who has yet to take part in raid 
          encounters. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To address this problem, 
          we've introduced the new &quot;Ancient&quot; category of spells recently. 
          Ancient spells are rare, high-quality spells that can only be obtained 
          from the most powerful monsters. These spells are improved versions 
          of spells already available to each casting class. They won't give casters 
          any brand-new, or out-of-class abilities, but are intended to make the 
          casters better at what they already do. Much like a warrior improves 
          himself by getting a better sword from a dragon, a wizard can now acquire 
          more efficient spells in the same way. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you might expect, Ancient 
          spells are going to be rare and take a certain amount of effort to obtain. 
          We don't expect many casters to ever get all the Ancient spells for 
          their class. This is a change from the traditional approach we've had 
          to spells, which has allowed every caster to feel entitled to get every 
          one of their spells. We'll continue to make core spells available to 
          casting classes off of vendors, or as relatively frequent drops off 
          of monsters, but we want to be clear that Ancient spells are rare and 
          powerful items of treasure, and we intend them to be very hard to get. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only the first set of Ancient 
          spells have been added to the game. In the coming weeks, we'll continue 
          to add more Ancient spells to the game and expand the selection for 
          casters and priests. It takes some time to get the spells balanced, 
          tested, and placed on monsters - so expect to see them coming in a few 
          sets at a time. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One last thing to note about 
          Ancient spells- the power of these spells will vary depending on what 
          monster drops them. You can expect Vulak A'err to have more powerful 
          Ancient spells than you might find on Trakanon, for instance. </font></p>

        <p><font size="5"><a name="legends"></a>Reports from Legends Server</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">3/15/02</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Registered With 
          Stormhammer the Legends server made a Vah Shir Beatslord - Name is Kyper,will 
          be moving my Main and another Character over from Fennin Ro. This is 
          Awsome theres nobody to compete with for newbie items for the quests 
          at least on luclin theres not most likely everywhere else too since 
          it still the lowest volume server. Well aside from the fact i think 
          its more fun is that the Website where everthing you do you can keep 
          track of all charaters and guild are listed alphabetically. Theres GM 
          held events all the time there posted on the websitesite also. Also 
          i hear and from reading theres new Beasteriy as like in case last night 
          never seen mention on quest list on alakazams site theres a little orange 
          scorpion thats over conned named Tailfang never saw him till last night 
          while on Legends in the Crater asked what quest he was for and reply 
          was when you do kill him you take his stinger too crater pit boss NPC 
          and he gives you a better piercing weapon not sure how much better yet 
          as he still conned yellow at lvl 2. Also haved done some reading on 
          a legends Forum that some zones have been revamped and are tougher like 
          Cazic Thule was mention. So far as i have progressed even the newbie 
          beast seem tougher than on the RP server.I got my arse handed to me 
          by a evenly conned Worm that was easy on the RP server i could kill 
          4 of these on the RP server by the time i can kill one now.Won't know 
          more till i get a better weapon an armor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i>A GM Event at Ry'gorrs Fort</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally got my main 
          transfered over lvl 43 Warrior just in time too here about what was 
          happening he was camped in EW at the rygor fort, i was in the middle 
          of it the whole time was in a few groups but either some in them had 
          connection probs or were suffering from the lag and we disbanded so 
          i just soloed didn't get no exp.but was alowed too loot a velious sword 
          off a dad giant.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GM event lasted 
          about 3 1/2 hors there was about 5 waves of 12 to 25 giants each time.There 
          was PC forces holding off the waves of giants coming in from EW too 
          and there was 10 groups trying to stop the influx of Giants coming in 
          from EW too.First wave consisted the weakest Kromicks,next wave was 
          there kindered more tougher then the Spearman wave ,then the Priest 
          and Swordsmen Wave finally when his second in command was defeated as 
          in a coulpe of those shots show him Rallos Zek became Mortal so we was 
          able to dispatch him.The Golden look of Zek was when he was invulnerable 
          a bunch of as you see were attacking then just for fun and he cast a 
          throw spell of sorts and we go flying through the air hundereds of yards 
          away the second time i got tossed i took over 400 Damage LOL.<br>
          <br>
          Like too note too the 15 or 25 of each wave was what made it through 
          the lines of defense in EW and and the zone line so haven't a clue as 
          too how giants toal were involved i do know this that useually theres 
          any where from 3 to 9 GM's online for just this server alone,And during 
          this event there was non on listed they were all operating these giants 
          and 2 were cooridinating the forces defending the city.<br>
          <br>
          This was A total Blast most fun i have had in a long time at times the 
          lag was bad even for me but i was still able too move to get in the 
          middle of the frey.<br>
          <br>
          We maybe paying a Premium cost for this but what we are getting is Premium 
          too and the reason i say this is that i have had to petition 3 differant 
          times for various things like for example i lost some items that were 
          no rent when my Vah Shir BL died they went poof which is not supposed 
          to happen even with norent items even if you log off you still have 
          them if its not been longer than 30 min. which in this case it was not 
          i just simply died and was still online.Each petition has ben answered 
          within 30 min.or less.<br>
          <br>
          Also on the Legends site theres a Events Calalender that list Dates 
          and Times for all GM and player run events.<br>
          <br>
          So far there is no Kewl DooDs either everyone i have met is friendly 
          and wants this server to be the best one there is,I even roleplay more 
          than ever exspecially when this lvl 60 came into the Shadoweaver thicket 
          when my BL was only lvl 8 and bragging how he owns us, i said no the 
          Guards will own you,he said your too little to be saying such things,i 
          said that ther will be a day in this cats future that i will be and 
          ill look you up then,So my little BL has an Enemy already lol</font></p>
