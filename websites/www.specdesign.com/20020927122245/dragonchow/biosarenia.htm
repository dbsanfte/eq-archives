    <font face="Arial">Born to a wealthy family in Erudian, I longed for adventures far away
    from the royal court. I was bored with the same old people discussing the same old things.
    I longed to travel, to discover new places, and perhaps to find quests to give my life
    purpose. I quickly left my home continent of Odus and took the sailing vessel to Qeynos.
    There I started up conversations with the local merchants and visitors to the town and
    discovered many were in need of assistance and would pay in food, gifts, or even a little
    coin. Wishing to be independent and not write home for funds from the royal family I
    decided this was a great way to earn my keep.<br>
    <br>
    One day after completing a most difficult task I met a Euridian Wizard who was just about
    my age.&nbsp; Since some of the quests I wished to perform seemed beyond my abilities
    alone I asked him to be my traveling companion and we have been together after since.<br>
    <br>
    Eldeberon and Sarenia have had many adventures together. You can read much about them in <a href="bioeldeberon.htm" style="color: rgb(0,128,128)">Eldeberon's Biography by clicking
    here</a>. </font><p><font face="Arial">Currently I'm starting to enter my middle
    age.&nbsp; I'm 35.&nbsp; I love making jewelry, (although it keeps me very poor - I've
    never had more than 500 plat to my name and currently have just 30 in the bank) but it is
    a fun hobby.&nbsp; My favorite zone has been Stoneburnt Mountains.&nbsp; I recently joined
    the Dragonchow Guild on an invite from Steddy.&nbsp; We fought together often in
    Stoneburnt mountains.&nbsp; I became very depressed and nearly left the game at level 29
    where I thought I would never advance.&nbsp; I've enjoyed the guild very much and I'm
    looking forward to fighting and meeting more people as time goes on.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Eldeberon and I have recently spent some time in Dalnir and have
    actually met and fought with a number of Dragonchow members.&nbsp; We don't venture in too
    deep but have had several sessions on the second floor.&nbsp; And have participated in a
    couple of exciting corpse recovery experiences of fellow team memebers.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Well after years of adventuring I finally convinced Eldeberon to take me on a vacation.
    &nbsp; Long have we heard of the far distant lands known as Velious and made our journeys
    to travel their via the famed gnome boat.&nbsp; (Eldeberon has the ability to port there
    but for our first trip I wanted to travel via boat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Well after only a few minutes on the distant shore I awoke from
    camping alone as Eldeberon had ported away while I slept to join fellow guild mate Drasus
    in the wilds of the Rathe Mountains.&nbsp; There they fought giants and Eldeberon lured by
    huge amounts of platinum coaxed me to join them there instead.&nbsp; We had a most
    enjoyable time killing this big and dumb brutes.&nbsp; And although we've not seen Drasus
    since that first evening it is where we remain today.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll be able to
    convince Eldeberon to return to Velious but for now we are lining our pockets and I'm
    dreaming of how this plat will raise my jewelry making skill.</font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial">Well it has been another few years since last I
    reported on my happenings.&nbsp; After filling our pockets with coins from Rathe Mountains
    we decided to return to Velious for our long waited vacation.&nbsp; We've fought a little
    outside the wizzy port spot and then went in search of the fabled dragon bridge. &nbsp;
    Without map or guide we wandered into the Rygorr fort and are currently relieving orcs of
    their heads earings, necklaces and all.&nbsp; We've made several new friends there and
    enjoy fighting quite alot.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Recently we were able to participate in our first real guild adventure.&nbsp; A raid on
    the Tower of Frozen Shadows organized by Medikar.&nbsp; You can read all about it and see
