            <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last night I encountered the most
            intelligent AI I have yet seen in the game. While fighting wurms in GD with Sarenia and
            Cabbz, we were pulling them out of their cave, and killing them with no problem. Then we
            pulled &quot;Jesse&quot; (my name for him not Verant's). The most impressive wurm--no the
            most impressive mob--I have ever fought. He seemed to be a typical Ancient Shardwurm. I
            pulled him and he blasted me over and over with nasty spells cutting my health down. I was
            almost dead when Cabbz (a shaman) healed me. I then turned and began massively nuking. I
            delivered several powerful blasts and brought him down to where he had no visible health.
            Suddenly he heals himself. I had never seen a wurm do that before. In a few seconds he was
            at full health. Again I nuked, and again he healed just before we could deliver the
            killing blow. Running out of mana I nuked him again until he was near death, then I
            watched as Jesse cast another spell. The first spell failed, (never saw a mob fail at a
            spell before either), then he cast a second spell of the same kind...and vanished. </font></p>
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now in the past wurms have displayed
            a nasty habit of poofing; that is to say they teleport for no good reason to the
            mountainside above the cave entrance. No spell causes them to do this and it seems more
            like a bug than a natural defense. It is only an inconvenience however, as you simply
            chase them up there and finish the job, but this wurm never appeared above the cave like
            the others. He was simply no where to be seen. I still had him in my target window and was
            concerned he would heal himself again. Sure enough his health surged up. Damn! I sat down
            and tried to med, hard to do when you are in such a fowl mood. And as I sat there staring
            at the target window a sudden realization stole over me. The wurm hadn't poofed. </font></p>
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know from experience that you
            can't accurately tell changes in the health of a mob unless you are near it. So the wurm
            couldn't be up on the mountain. Jesse had to be close by. That's when it hit me--Jesse
            hadn't teleported he had gone invisible! To test this theroy I stood up and fired off my
            Staff of Temperate Flux--this is a clickable debuffing item. Sure enough the staff took
            effect. The bloody wurm was standing somewhere right next to us medding and healing! I
            have to say I was impressed. </font></p>
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cast a nuke spell at the invisible
            creature and it did full damage. I began to cast a second when I went link dead. Shortly
            afterwards Sarenia went LD too. When we returned Sarenia discovered she was standing naked
            in Gfay--she was dead. The wurm had found her LD and killed her. I was starting to think
            Jesse could cast Linkdead spells too. I had to gate to port Sarenia back from her bind
            spot, and I am disappointed to tell you that we never did manage to find or kill that
            wurm. Yet it is interesting to know that Jesse is still out there, somewhere. One day we
            hope to find him and finish our dispute one way or another. </font></p>
            <p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(btw the name &quot;Jesse&quot; is
            in deference to the infamous bear from Northern Exposer)</font></p>

            I were fighting in the Spider Hall in Crystal Caves and wished to challenge the might of
            the Spider Queen, but knew we didn't have the strength. I told Freyana, (who was on
            Luclin), that we needed help, and without even asking for what, she replied
            &quot;OMW&quot;. Kendrick, who was in the neighborhood only to drop something off with his
            monk, dropped what he was doing, and also came to our assistance. Despite receiving no
            experience and little loot, Freyana and Kendrick played until 2 am EST helping us take
            down the Spider queen. Just one more reason we can be proud to bear the DC tag above our
            heads. Thanks a lot guys! </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Friday night our good friend Drasus,
            the Iksar Shammy, left us for military service which will keep him occupied for at least a
            year. Sarenia and I attempted to hold a surprise farewell party for him in West Commons
            late Friday, but few DC's were still on. Nevertheless, Sarenia got Sylen to show up and I,
            through deception, ported Drasus into WC. Sarenia passed out beer to all, and shortly
            afterwards we were attacked by Dragoon Zytl. With intelligence hovering at an average of
            43, and eye sight blurring badly, we all did battle with Zytl and his pet. Sarenia had to
            gate, and poor Drasus nearly died, when suddenly I realized I was targeted on Zytl when I
            thought I had his pet--who was beating the crap out of me. It was a comedy of errors that
            left us sprawled drunk laughing and bleeding on the dew covered grass near the wizzy
            pyramid in WC at one o'clock in the morning. Could there have been a better send off? I'm
            not sure.</font></p>

            Thanks to Klothe/Steddy, I discovered a site that features EQ Comics that allow the
            reposting of their images. Finding many of them to be humorous I thought the guild might
            enjoy seeing them as well. It might take some of the sting out of loosing that level. So
            you might see them appearing here from time to time on this page just below the

            <br>
            <i>From the diary of Mrpain:</i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">It was a normal day in the
            Overthere. Occasional rain, fog, and Goons roaming the zone. Accompanied by Swiftpain,
            Drasus, Seung, Scalezz and Drukinpinoch (With Lindsay and Kinney watching over us) - I was
            hunting Sarnaks at the ruins. Making pretty short work of these atrocities, we cleared out
            the wandering wildlife to pass the time.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">It was about then that we heard the
            call &quot;Goons are out!&quot; and begain discussing the possibility of facing one. It
            was then decided by the group that we would actively seek out one of these intolerant
            beggars and make an example out of him. Dragoon T'Vem was the closest, so Drasus walked up
            to him and got his attention. T'Vem had little clue what was waiting for him just over the
            next rise.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Once he crested the hill, he saw
            Scalezz. The necromancer was quick to deal damage to T'Vem through the use of his
            lifetapping spells. This enraged T'Vem and he proceeded to chase Scalezz around the field
            with blood in his eyes. While the rest of us attempted to catch T'Vem from behind, it
            proved very difficult to follow his movements. Occasionally hitting him from behind, and
            calling &quot;STOP!&quot; to Scalezz, we finally got his attention and Swiftpain,
            Drukinpinoch, and myself proceded to beat him up. The pets added in and the battle raged.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">As the Shamans worked furiously to
            keep us healthy, Swiftpain and I split his attention to lessen the urgency of their
            spells. Soon T'Vem was looking a bit ragged and torn. All the while, Scalezz continued to
            drain his life. We fought him with renewed ferocity when the shamans begain calling out
            &quot;Out of Mana!&quot;. Fortunately, Lindsay was nearby and was casting heals herself.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Seconds later, standing over the
            body of Dragoon T'Vem, someone mentioned that the Goon Death Squad doesn't take too kindly
            to one of their own being taken down. We decided that discretion was the better part of
            valor and looted quickly as we headed out of the area. Soon the bulk of us (the ones
            without Feign Death) were in the Frontier Mountains. When we were sure that they had
            forgotten about our battle with T'Vem, we met back at the ruins again and continued
            hunting.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Now with the effort involved with
            killing one of these Dragoons, one would think they would have something worth looting.
            Truth is, this military midget left behind a Long Sword and a bad taste in the air -- what
            the softskins call 'smell'. Other then the bragging rights to having faced down a Dragoon,
            there wasn't much yield from our struggle.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Despite the lack of good treasure, I
            found great enjoyment in ending his reign of terror. Shouts of relief came up accross the
            zone as he fell, and the fame of Dragonchow was spread once again. Now to move on to his
            boss - General D'Veers!</font></p>

            To date, only Woodweaver and Swifthand have sent in any submissions to this site.
            Woodweaver's contribution is evident on his bio page, while our beloved Guild Leader is
            graciously assisting me in creating a definitive history of the guild, which will be
            posted as soon as it is done. Keep in mind that while this site may look pretty, its
            energy and function comes from guild members. The more information I can post about what
            members are doing, and what is happening in Dragonchow, the more enjoyable this site will
            be to visit. For example: I heard rumors that in the Naggy raid the raid was wiped out
            except for one lone member who defeated Nagafen in solo combat! Who was this person? This
            Dragonslayer? Was it a Chow? What actually happened? <br>

            <p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><strong>VACATION DELAYED</strong><br>
            Sarenia and Eldeberon's long anticipated vacation to Velious was cut short when Drasus
            invited us to hunt giants with him in Rathe Mountains. Being poor, the promise of untold
            wealth was simply too enticing to ignore. So after killing only three snow cougars near
            the dock, Sarenia and Eldeberon ported out and joined Drasus. We will most likely stick
            around Rathe as long as Drasus (or other guild members) are available to assist us (as I
            don't think we can hunt these red giants alone). </font></p>
            </font><p><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><strong>PORTRAIT TAKING</strong><br>
            For those of you wishing to send in pictures of your character, here is a helpful tip: Try
            standing near a wall, then change to camera view and rotate the camera until it hits the
            wall. This will push the camera close to your character so you can take a nice close-up.
            Then rotate yourself for the right angle, and hit the minus key on your keypad. Zip it,
            (with Winzip), and attach it to your email. For those of you with graphics programs the
            image should be 193 by 355 pixels at 72 dpi RGB and saved as a quality 4 jpg.</font></p>

            sacrifice for his honor, but then Sylen (at least I think it was Sylen), went and spoiled
            the fun by resolving the problem and fostering peace in our time.&nbsp; </big></font></p>
