    <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:white">What can I say?
    &nbsp; I am just a girl.&nbsp; I do the usual girl things.&nbsp; I like to sleep late and
    take my time preparing myself for my everyday activities.&nbsp; Usually around midmorning
    I awake from my slumber to the crackle of a warm fire.&nbsp; Breakfast is the most
    important meal of the day, my father Dharamsala was right about that.&nbsp; Following a
    long shower in the waterfalls of lovely Neriak, I comb my hair and stretch my sore muscles
    for another day of adventure.&nbsp; By midday I begin with a short jog thru the city
    visiting all the merchants who used to entertain me as a child and taught me the value of
    a coin as I grew older,&nbsp;often&nbsp;teasing me about being a &quot;rich girl&quot;
    from the Third Gate area of town.&nbsp; But I look down on no one, rich or poor, as&nbsp;I
    have seen the most common man risk his very life to save another unknown to him.
    &nbsp; Ahh.. the fresh bread from Drana's bread and butchery, I take it with me wherever I
    roam.&nbsp; Often I bring some to Ungia and Putad at the smithie's shop, ohh! how I love
    to listen to their stories!&nbsp; Everyday they get more and more fantastic as they are
    retold!&nbsp; And then of course there is good old Slug... lol... what can I say about his
    drunken ramblings?&nbsp; You just have to love the man.&nbsp; <u1:p></u1:p><o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:white">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;color:white">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After my quick visits and
    my supplies gathered, I head out through the tunnel to Nektulos Forest.&nbsp; Stopping to
    talk to &quot;the boys&quot; who guard our lovely glen from ones who would do my people
    harm.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my younger days I would run to them for help when my hunting party
    got in over their heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;These brave men would save me and wipe my tears and
    let me rest up as they watched for the wild beasts of the forest.&nbsp; Times have changed
    now and often times I sit with them and tell them stories of adventure and danger none of
    them have imagined.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span><span style="color:white"></o:p></span></font><u1:p></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:white">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peridots!&nbsp; Innoruuk help me,&nbsp;I almost forgot!&nbsp; Come with
    me to East Commons to a friendly Erudite who has the best peridots in the land.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Jewel shopping... what woman can resist jewel shopping? and on such a fine
    day as this.&nbsp; As a girl I would come here with my father to look in the cases and see
    all the magnificent jewels and jewelry on display.&nbsp;&nbsp;He would speak with the
    store owner and buy what he needed to work is powerful deadly magic.&nbsp; Oftentimes he
    would surprise me with a jasper or two to aid the ones I travel with.&nbsp; Although not
    able to fully understand the reasoning behind my studies in the Spires of Innoruuk to
    become a healer of others, my Dad encouraged me to follow my own path and helped me to
    attain my goals whatever they may have been.&nbsp; Now, as I look back&nbsp;I see his
    point of view a bit more clearly, as a Necromancer hardly needs company to get his work
    accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp; And now as I have surpassed him in ability and experience I come
    to this store alone and buy myself the most beautiful stones available as he had done
    years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Red my girl&quot; he would say &quot;one day you will be a
    Vicar, and the riches of the world will be yours.&nbsp; Remember those who have come
    before you, and listen to them always, for true wisdom can not be bought at market or
    found on your foes, true wisdom comes from experience.&quot;&nbsp; How right he was.

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:white">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look
    there!&nbsp; That is a Freeport guard looking dubiously at me.&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time
    this used to bother me, now as I approach them the look of distrust quickly turns to
    cowardice as their eyes avert to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly they want no trouble from
    the likes of me.&nbsp; 'Tis a game I play with them, or should I say AT them, for they do
    not know the rules by which I play.&nbsp; Though I would never hurt them (again) they do
    not know this, and thus is the way I like to keep things.&nbsp; But time is a'wasting and
    these&nbsp;foolish games of chicken must cease, for there are people who need me, my
    adopted family awaits my arrival.&nbsp;&nbsp;For something in the cold caverns of far off
    lands has risen from the shadows and has taken many lives.&nbsp; As I speak,
    reinforcements are gathering at spires and circles around Norrath as we prepare to teach
    those who oppose us that they must better themselves before they see the last of
    Dragonchow.&nbsp; For our memory is long, and our reach is limitless.&nbsp;&nbsp;And
    nothing will stand in our way.&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as breath remains in&nbsp;our youngest
    member&nbsp;and wisdom is passed down through the ranks&nbsp;there is nothing and no
    one&nbsp;who will&nbsp;destroy one of us without&nbsp;destroying us all.&nbsp; <u1:p></u1:p><o:p></o:p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:white">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I
    must bid you adieu, my porter is here and I musn't keep him waiting.&nbsp; Be well, be
    safe, and may the light of Innoruuk illume you in the darkest places and the darkest
    times.<u1:p></u1:p><o:p></o:p></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:24.0pt;color:white">&nbsp;</span><span style="color:white"><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
