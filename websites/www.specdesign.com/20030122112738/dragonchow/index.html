                            in a &quot;cliff hanger&quot; with hundreds of people 
                            begging for the next piece (ok maybe not hundreds 
                            but 2 or 3 at least). In any case I find them quite 
                            amusing and each one has members of DC popping up 
                            so who knows you just might find yourself here. So

                            Kithcor. Since I've been with DC we've done this raid 
                            3 times the first we wiped the second two times were 
                            a success. Pulling for this is NOT trivial. It takes 
                            quite awhile but if we get good turn out then we can 
                            off tank and not worry so much about the splitting 
                            of these hard hitting dark elves. Also if we fail 
                            on this the rogues start back at &quot;square #1&quot; 
                            so it is imperative for us &quot;not to fail&quot;. 
                            We need big guild turn out for this - I'm trying to 
                            arrange a day/time when both rogues are available 
                            (we can back to back) and have Swifty around for pulling 
                            (he did a great job with Sythen's) so stay tuned for

                            so I'll be looking in on him starting next week. We 
                            did one &quot;exploratory mission&quot; into his lair 
                            and wiped but we learned alot. I think I now have 
                            some ideas about how to take down this mob. Just waiting 
                            to see a date/time that works with some of the big 
                            guns since we need their help on this one.</span><br>

                            got no torches or Reavers even though we did kill 
                            many Reavers(and Neh once). This is not uncommon with 
                            CoM we just have to kill Reavers and do them alot 
                            and we will slowly clear this back log. We are also 
                            exploring &quot;other techniques&quot; to farm these

                            one but 2 epic pieces in CoM, Painkeeper got a nice 
                            Ornate Runed Shield and Ramoth picked up a nice Ornate 
                            Rune Weapon and Kaia picked up her remaining shammy

                            Bloody Renux Battle<br>
                            <span class="Normal">Well in what can only be described 
                            as &quot;the worst battle I've ever been in involved 
                            with&quot; we finally took down Renux for Clade. I 
                            was ill and not thinking clearly and was impatient 
                            to &quot;get this done&quot;. So I apologize for going 
                            into this &quot;ill prepared&quot;. We had done it 
                            just the other night for Kreton and it was cake. But 
                            I'm not familiar with this mob and I'll not underestimate 
                            it in the future. The issues. Rez and Sar were not 
                            bound near the fight and they died early and had a 
                            long run to get back. This mob has all melee but has 
                            a &quot;spinning poison&quot; that Sar got hit with 
                            and put her out of the fight. Fearing was fine but 
                            we needed more melee. I was dead and running two hydras 
                            to get back to zone so missed a lot of this fight 
                            but I know the bodies were stacking up like cord wood. 
                            I want to thank those that &quot;stuck in there&quot; 
                            and those that &quot;came a running&quot; when they 
                            heard it went bad. I'm still not sure how she went 
                            down and who all was involved but we finally did get 
                            the job done (For awhile there it looked like a complete 
                            lost cause). I think though this shows the true spirit 
                            of DC. People kept at it even though they had died 
                            multiple times they continued to sacrifice themselves 
                            for a fellow DC the effort was commendable - A tip 
                            of the helm to all of you, and at least we got it 
                            done. </span></b></font><br>

                            to something it really gets done. He wins the award 
                            for &quot;the most epic mobs in one day&quot;. He 
                            started with the corrupted brownie and did not quite 
                            make it. He then asked if I would help him with corrupted 
                            seahorses so off to kedge we went. We got fairly lucky 
                            and old tainted showed up in the second round of PH's 
                            and we wacked him dead. A quick trip to Lfay (Rez 
                            and Sar bound there) and we went back to our shard 
                            farming while Megil looked for the brownie again. 
                            Well in a short while there he was 2 quick gates later 
                            Rez and Sar were on the scene and another epic mob 
                            added to the list. Then back to shard farming. Megil 
                            tells me Corrupted gorillia was up but CH'd before 
                            he could finish him - so a quick port and a little 
                            scouting and this Sar and Rez lent a hand on this 
                            one as well. We got LOTS of Adds but no problem just 
                            mezz them all down and port after we are done. Well 
                            back to Shard hunting for Rez and now Enilate (Megil's 
                            other self) joined in and with him pulling (What a 
                            great job) we cleared mobs fast and furious. Unfortunately 
                            no shards dropped but lots of mobs were killed thanks 
                            for the help Enilate. Well then to camp the whole 
                            night off. After ragefire we stole a group to Swamp 
                            of no Hope and killed the Umplick Froggy. So megil 
                            got 4 epic mobs in one day. He is down to one kill 
                            to be complete and it is scheduled. Click <a href="http://pub157.ezboard.com/fdragonchow17219frm2.showMessage?topicID=238.topic" class="links">here</a>

                            a CTA (Call to arms) got this mob smacked down for 
                            him and a spare piece for Tahlia in the process. Earlier 
                            in the day Doggy, Rez and Sar went off to Kedge to 
                            do the illusive Corrupted Sea horses. We had to wait 
                            longer than with Megil but in not to short order he 
                            was dispatched so 2 more pieces for Doggy - Congratz!! 
                            -- Oh would have been 3 since he found froggy up on 
                            Sunday but the first sighting I did not see adequate

                            Macey/Sal were doing CT so it was not a good time. 
                            But don't worry Doggy we have this froggies number 
                            and we'll take him down pretty quick. Just keep tracking 
                            for him and when up give a yell.</span></b></font></p>

                            a shard dropped and Telas was afk. Doh!! A phone call 
                            to his house gave no results. At 30 secs Rez was going 
                            to loot it but luckily Telas came back with just 1 
                            min 30 sec to spare !! Woot. Then the next night we 
                            did a &quot;pick-up&quot; raid for Ragefire and he

                            got 3 overkings killed on Saturday and I would like 
                            to single out a few people. First to Peign who pulled 
                            with exceptional diligence. The life of a puller in 
                            Chardoks is a short lived one and I've never seen 
                            it done yet without multiple deaths. Even with 96% 
                            rezzes I'm sure Peign took a hit to do this for us 
                            and your guild thanks you. Second to Sickli who's 
                            positive faction with the mobs of Chardok let her 
                            travel safely and drag dead DC back to the waiting 
                            arms of their clerics. Our first attempt down resulted 
                            in a wipe and Sickli was the only one left standing 
                            to loot the king so we got an extra scroll and some 
                            nice drops as well. I would also like to thank Nighthunter 
                            (non DC) who answered our call for help. We had no 
                            rogue and it looked like the trip was going to be 
                            a short lived one. The second attempt down we had 
                            our own rogue available - THANK YOU STRAHHD!! Without 
                            you we could not go back and we would have been 2 
                            less epic items. I would like to also thank Izuno 
                            who while only there a short while provided CoH for 
                            people to come in. In the future please please if 
                            you are CoH mages out there come to this. Had we been 
                            able to CoH back Salavar and Cammi we could have gotten 
                            an epic piece for her too. I'm sorry we were not able 
                            to take out the queen. She is the toughest mob DC 
                            has ever taken down and I don't think we had everything 
                            we needed to do this one. Well its not like its the 
                            last time we will be going there. In any case Grats 
                            to Mr. Mini on his new BP. Cheat and Cobolt no their 
                            Ardent Protectors and most importantly Salelen and 
                            Telas on their singed scrolls. (And one still on Sickli

                            of rare and not so rare items from around all of Norath. 
                            The final step which we did on Sunday was to follow 
                            around a small bald headed guy and keep him safe from 
                            5 waves of mobs. Death was at minimum and it was fun

                            game hours left till it poofed we did the turn in. 
                            Our fearless leader started leading the huge Fire

                            on the scene and raced out to pull him in. Even with

                            took Ixi down with just one death (Sorry Beringer

                            I just got the 61 Planar AA ability Wake the Dead. 
                            This ability allows me to raise a ghost of the player 
                            or mob that I choose to become my pet- on top of still 
                            having my own pet. So, for instance- if say Salavar 
                            goes down in a raid- I can target the mob he was just 
                            on, Wake the Dead and have Salavar's ghost return 
                            to life and stay on the mob as if he never left. Pretty 
                            cool methinks. Anyway, this photo is of some dead 
                            dark elf in Dawnshroud Peaks zone. Just playing around 
                            in there I pulled a mob and cast Wake the Dead on 
                            it to see what he would do... and I heard the tell 
                            tale sound of a pet getting made. Hehe. Turns out 
                            he was a necro as well and was making a pet (as we 
                            necros sometimes do). As you can see, although I didn't 
                            have my personal pet made at the time- I have the 
                            ability to have 3 pets for 60 seconds.... now if I 
                            can just find a dead epic Mage.... ohhh and Eld, you 
                            can die near me anytime pal- I would love to take 
                            a 60 wizzy out for a spin for 60 seconds of terror 
                            nuking with no fear of aggro. Rumor has it that if 
                            I wake someone at the end of a fight- it will spend 
                            the 60 seconds healing/buffing etc. I have decided 
                            to get Redline dead from a duel where I fight from 
                            now on- /consent Dharamsala and drag her around wherever 
                            I go for heroic bond- symbols- heals- I wonder if 
                            she would rezz me? hummmmmmmmm<br>
