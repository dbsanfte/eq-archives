        <p> <font size="2"></font>What is /Guildchat ?</p>
        <p>/Guildchat is a party line. What this means is that we all share it.</p>
        <p>One of the most important uses of it is for raids, but it is also there 
          as a means that we as individuals can reach out to us as a group. Its 
          for questions like, Does anyone know what X is for? Or about quest Y? 
          The going price for a Z? What&#146;s camped in Dungeon P? Anyone wanna 
          go kill Q? Could I get some help with R? Once the initial question is 
          answered by someone, you should consider whether you need more information 
          from the guild as a whole or whether you can get that from the answerer 
          in /tells.</p>
        <p>/Guildchat is also our lifeline that keeps us all connected and lets 
          us know we aren&#146;t just a whole bunch of people stuck behind a glowing 
          box, punching keys like chimpanzees in various locations of the world.</p>
        <p>Its important to remember that words are the only thing we see on a 
          screen when using /gu. We do not hear the tone of voice of the person 
          typing them, nor we do not know the intent of person typing them. We 
          can only try and interpret from what we see, so it is very important 
          that when we type something we consider how it will be viewed by others. 
          Sometimes we will miss half a conversation thru zoning or LD so it is 
          becomes even more important we consider how we are saying something 
          and how it will be heard. Try and use common sense when in /Guildchat 
          (and even in /tells). Think about what you are saying and if it might 
          be offensive think about maybe not saying it. Do not defame. Do not 
          denigrate. Do not behave in anyway that shows a lack of courtesy or 
          respect. Words can hurt and we come into EQ to get away from the hurt 
          NOT to get more of it.</p>
        <p>/Guildchat is the major in game forum that allows us to keep in touch 
          and communicate with each other. In respect to the diverse group of 
          folks that we have in our guild, there are some subjects that we feel 
          are best left out of this forum. Some folks have some very strong personal 
          views, and we play EQ to have fun and not to make others angry or uncomfortable. 
          There should be no discussions concerning Race, Sex, Religion, Politics 
          or Money.</p>
        <p>That said did you hear the one about How much the (insert ethnicity/religion) 
          Priest paid to sleep with the (insert ethnicity/religion) Governor&#146;s 
          Daughter?</p>
        <p>Which bring us to banter.</p>
        <p>Pushing boundaries, riding the edge, seeing just how far we can take 
          it is only natural. We like to tease and twist and generally tweak folks 
          all in the name of humor. It shows that we are comfortable enough with 
          them that they won&#146;t see it as an attack, but just as it was meant 
          in fun. Again consider your words carefully and consider the timing 
          of them. Also consider that the tone, intent, phrasing can&#146;t be 
          heard through the screen. Then consider :P , 8 P , ; ) , 8/ , or (j/k). 
          These things when added at the end of or in the middle of the sentence 
          do send out the message that you are kidding where as their lack leaves 
          us in the dark. But while these emoticons do add that face and voice 
          we can&#146;t see, still consider your listening audience and what mood 
          they are in. If it ain&#146;t gonna cheer them up, if it was said in 
          any anger with malice in mind, if you wouldn&#146;t want it said to 
          you in a like situation then best do what my momma told me which is 
          &#133; say nothing at all.<br>
