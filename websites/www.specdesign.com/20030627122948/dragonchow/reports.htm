          a Necromancer, my job was vague at best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Providing some buff spells that were sure to be dispelled by 
          the mighty dragon so that the spell effects of other buff spells would 
          remain was the first part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Supplying 
          other casters and clerics with mana was part two, and sending my pet 
          off to attack ole Naggy was part three.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span class="Normal">All was going 
          well, but we seemed a bit light on forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Trusting in my raid leader, I was ready for a heated (no pun 
          intended) battle.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon the attack was launched, and the warriors charged forward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
          &nbsp; </span>Next was the casters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Landing a spell on Lord Nagafen is darn near impossible for a 
          Necromancer, so I was jogging back and forth to heal and mana pump as 
          I could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon the warriors, 
          shadowknights and monks started dropping, and the healers were being 
          summoned by the Lord of Fire to meet their deaths in the lava pits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Fortunately, I had cast Dead Man Floating on them and they remained 
          above the damage of the lava.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the dragon also has very sharp claws, and they 
          were torn to bits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p><span class="Normal">The 
          casters were next, and I knew my moment of death was upon me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>There is a quiet stillness that comes from wanting only to hurt 
          your foe before you die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps 
          it is because you have accepted your death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Maybe it is tension of the moment, allowing you to see each second 
          as it passes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, my pet was still alive and swinging and I knew 
          I had time to make Lord Nagafen pay for my death.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I quickly launched into a spell casting furor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>One spell resisted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> &nbsp; </span>Two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Three.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lord Nagafen 
          is burned with acid!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Success!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Midway through the next spell casting my pet died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p><span class="Normal">Assuming 
          that I was next, I interrupted my casting at the same time I was summoned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Tearing through my Steelskin, Lord Nagafen attacked with the 
          absolute certainty that I would die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Just as the magical barrier dropped, I was able to put up another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Impenetrable but taxing as it was, I knew I could not maintain 
          it for long and decided to put some distance between me and the dragon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Just as my barrier dropped, I began to feign death in hopes of 
          fooling the beast into thinking he had already done me in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>I was summoned to his feet and destined to be his next meal.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><o:p></o:p><span class="Normal">Perhaps 
          it was that quiet stillness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps 
          it was my secret desire to survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>What ever it was, I was glad for it because I was able to maintain 
          my concentration and finish the spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
          &nbsp; </span>Immediately, the dragon lost interest in me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
          &nbsp; </span>He saw me as just one more corpse for snacking on later 
          and moved deeper into his lair.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At this point, I lay there undecided.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Do I run now or wait for help?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Looking down at the bodies around me, I began to drag them to 
          a safe spot for a cleric to undo Naggy&#146;s handiwork.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Several trips later, Naggy saw my efforts and roared his disapproval.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>By this time I had recovered my energy and was able to pull off 
          the same trick as before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now 
          it was 4 times that he had attempted to kill me and I had survived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Perhaps this is a sign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>Maybe I just got lucky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>You can decide for yourself, but I like to think I am just that 
          damn good!</span></font></p>

          I ignore him........<br>
          <br>
          He says he is disapointed in me he thought better of me then that, and 
          calls me a gimp........<br>
          <br>
          I am thinking For a Gimp and a cpl of pallys (Reynalius says: Pally's 
          suck!) we did pretty good, and we all share a laugh...<br>

                was an unusually warm and sunny day in Iceclad as I trudged through 
                the knee deep snow making my way past the gnoll camp toward the 
                distant tower. The Tower of Frozen Shadows it was called by the 
                locals, or TOFS for short. I had never been there before, but 
                the guild leader of Dragonchow had called for a raid upon it and 
                I was answering that call. I had also never been on a raid before. 
                <br>
                <br>
                All I knew of raids was what I heard over the guild speak channel 
                on Friday nights. Usually the great Warlord Radalas was barking 
                orders while others were reporting mana levels. It all sounded 
                very exciting, but I was always too young to join. This time however 
                Swifthand had called for a 30-40 level assault on TOFS, and I 
                was eager to be apart of it. Not only would this be my first guild 
                organized assault, it would also be my first meeting with many 
                of the legendary names of Dragonchow.<br>
                <br>
                I reached the tower under the cover of invisibility. It was a 
                bit dank and drab inside, but I was out of the wind at least. 
                In the tower&#146;s antechamber I found my wife Sarenia, the 36<sup>th</sup> 
                level Erudian Enchantress, and MrPain, the 36<sup>th</sup> level 
                Iksar Warrior. Now, having done some research about the guild 
                I knew MrPain, was also none other than Teroth Castille the Duke 
                of Dragonchow, (our sovereign&#146;s brother). We sat together 
                in the cold flagstone awaiting the others, while Sarenia made 
                small talk, or flirted with MrPain, I honestly can&#146;t tell 
                the difference anymore. It wasn&#146;t long before His Lordship 
                Swifthand Silvereyes entered and stood upon the stone dais above 
                us and observed the assembled troops. He left swiftly (perhaps 
                it was the source of his name) muttering something about getting 
                a cleric. Then, unseen, and unannounced I turned to find a human 
                beside me clad in silver armor, with a bushy brown mustache. It 
                was Radalas the Great, hero of Kael. I immediately bowed before 
                him, when I noticed someone from the Allegiance of Faith had also 
                arrived and was sitting quietly in the shadows. His name was Salfadorn 
                a high level cleric. <br>
                <br>
                </font> </span> 
                <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial">Swifthand 
                  returned and with him came Medikar, and Dharius, a 29<sup>th</sup> 
                  level cleric. It was then that the King explained his intent. 
                  He was forming a 30-40 level group to fight in the tower as 
                  a training exercise, while having the higher level guild members 
                  standing by as our safely net for when we got ourselves in trouble. 
                  It was important that we newbies learned the proper art of group 
                  play for when we get old enough to join the true raids. Soon 
                  Drukinpinoch, a 36<sup>th</sup> level shadowknight arrived and 
                  we began fighting. Our intent was to obtain the first key that 
                  would allow us access through the mirror (portal), to the next 
                  level up. At first we were sloppy, at least I was. Cramped quarters, 
                  and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>lots of mobs 
                  made it hard to determine how best to assist the group. It didn&#146;t 
                  take long before we had two sets of keys, and off we went to 
                  the second level. </font></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>This 
                  was the library. Several ghostly students were busy at their 
                  desks scribbling away, and when we arrived the librarian seemed 
                  upset and told us so by attacking. Poor MrPain held her off 
                  while<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I nuked and 
                  Dharius healed, and Sarenia kept the rest at bay. We fell into 
                  a better rhythm here, until Swifthand pulled the whole room 
                  at once causing Salfadorn (I think, or perhaps Saladar made 
                  a cameo appearance) to cast a powerful spell killing the entire 
                  lot at once. This happened a few times and resulted in a net 
                  value of one blue bub per area nuke.</font></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Dharius 
                  obtained the teacher&#146;s Syllubus, as did I and Sarenia managed 
                  to get one of the student&#146;s homework (all nice caster items), 
                  but then things went deadly. Sarenia was singled out by one 
                  of the ghosts and killed. In attempting to help her I gained 
                  the agro and was being slaughtered. Dharius attempted to help 
                  but was killed himself before he could. All three of us died 
                  in short order. We were all quickly resurrected however, an 
                  interesting experience&#151;Sarenia had never been rezzed before 
                  and I only once. </font></span></p>

                  gaining tremendous experience, and three nice items, it was 
                  then decided that we should do something truly insa&#133;I mean 
                  challenging. We were going directly to the top of the tower 
                  and face <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5604" style="color: rgb(128,128,255)">Tserrina&#146;s</a> 
                  power openly. This was where my life took a bad turn, or perhaps 
                  more accurately I turned the wrong way. </font></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>We 
                  exited the tower and appeared at the base amidst a handful of 
                  stone guardians, little spinning tornados of rocks that hit 
                  for about 60 points of damage. Everyone had bolted away very 
                  quickly, while I stood hesitating my next move. I had a fifty 
                  fifty chance I figured. The door back into the tower, the safety 
                  of a zone was only a short distance away, but which way, left 
                  or right? Sarenia shouted for me to go left. (assuming I was 
                  facing the tower, problem was, I was facing away from the tower.) 
                  I turned left and began running around the base picking up more 
                  and more stone tornados as I ran, thinking the door had to be 
                  there any second. My seconds ran out however, and my spirit 
                  left my body. </font></span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>I 
                  was dead for quite sometime as Radalas and Swifthand search 
                  for my corpse. I was hearing various reports and chatter about 
                  feeding my body to the Gnolls and Iksars finding Euridan tastes 
                  remarkably well. I became really concerned when they announced 
                  they did not have enough pieces left to resurect. &nbsp; Sarenia 
                  began her search for a new husband and set her eyes on Indra 
                  but Purti said he was taken.&nbsp; Finally I was found and resurrected. 
                  I appeared at my body at the base of the tower, with Switfy 
                  and Rad on either side of me. I immediately looted. No sooner 
                  had I finished than I was attacked by more of the same whirling 
                  stones. I noticed that Swifty had dragged my corpse and I was 
                  now standing right in front of the door. All I needed to do 
                  was take two steps and zone. When I tried to move however, I 
                  was unable. I was so weak from being mostly dead, I couldn&#146;t 
                  even managed the two steps. I had a beard with Storm Giant&#146;s 
                  strength and tried firing that off to boost me enough to fall 
                  into the door, but it failed to free me. I died shortly there 
                  after, and can still hear Swifthand&#146;s mournful cry in my 
                  dead ears as he yelled, &#147;NO!&#148;</font></span></p>

                  though I don&#146;t know why or how. I watched the clouds passing 
                  by, for quite sometime and began to grow concerned&#151;something 
                  wasn&#146;t right. I started to feel a desire to go into the

                <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial">We 
                  dusted ourselves off and there were a few moments where we looked 
                  for new, higher level recruits to help us tackle the top of 
                  the tower. Soon we were off once more. We reached a new mirror 
                  and no key we had worked, but now a new guild member joined 
                  us. Crymrych a shape shifting Dwarven rogue made quick work 
                  of picking the lock and suddenly we were all on the top level 
                  of the tower. We fought for a brief time, killing a few bats, 
                  then we were ordered to go invisible and follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
                  &nbsp; </span>We walked along a treacherous polished stone parapet 
                  to the right side was a spiral staircase; to the other was a 
                  sheer drop. To my shock Medikar and Radalas jumped off. <br>
                  <br>
                  &#147;But isn&#146;t there a stair?&#148; I started to say, 
                  when out of fear of losing the group I jumped as well seriously 
                  twisting my ankle at the bottom. Off we went again, this time 
                  down a narrow corridor with arched openings on either side. 
                  I was bringing up the rear (no doubt due to the pain in my ankle), 
                  when my invis dropped unexpectedly. I was attacked. Several 
                  bat swarmed me at once, apparently they have a fondness for 
                  Erudian blood. In retrospect I should have stopped and died 
                  in the corridor, but not realizing the power of the bats, and 
                  perhaps over estimating the prowess of my comrades, I ran to 
                  them assuming they would make quick work of the cute little 
                  rats with wings. Indeed when I heard Radalas shout, &#147;DIE 
                  ELD!&#148; I thought he it was calling a warning to the others 
                  that I was in trouble and needed help, when in fact he really 
                  wanted me to drop dead. Not clear on the situation I didn&#146;t 
                  understand, but I would soon learn. <br>
                  <br>
                  By bringing the bats into the otherwise safe room, I lead the 
                  death parade for my party. One after another they dropped, death 
                  and carnage was everywhere. Sarenia died next, and Radalas, 
                  MrPain and Crymrych fought valiantly, side by side in a suicide 
                  battle that managed to buy Medikar the precious few moments 
                  he needed to camp out. I must say I was very impressed with 
                  the teamwork, skill and courage displayed in that desperate 
                  hour. More was to come. <br>
                  <br>
                  Once more I found myself hovering in limbo watching the clouds 
                  and listening to the chatter of my loved ones in the guild.&nbsp; 
                  Purti was in a group somewhere and frustrated with her Cleric.&nbsp; 
                  Apparently he had taken up pulling and was neglecting is healing 
                  responsibilites.&nbsp; Mirer and Purti had an ongoing conversation 
                  how there should be no &quot;battle clerics&quot; and the disasters 
                  that becomes of them.&nbsp; <br>

                <p class="Normal"><img src="images/tofs2.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="576" HEIGHT="432"><font face="Arial">Ironically 
                  during this conversation Medikar came back into the tower.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                  Alone and lacking mana he faced a vampire from the bat that 
                  was slain by the group before they all died.&nbsp; Alone he 
                  waged a battle while we from our external vantages gave him 
                  encouragement and moral support.&nbsp; Minutes seemed like hours 
                  while we awaited the fate of our last remaining survivor.&nbsp; 
                  Finally news - &quot;It's going to be close&quot; &nbsp; we 
                  heard him say - we held our breath.&nbsp; Victory&nbsp; at last.&nbsp; 
                  Sarenia shoulted across the guild &quot;Medikar is the mightest 
                  battle cleric!&quot;&nbsp; Purti replied &quot;Please tell me 
                  you are kidding.&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Well there were unusually 
                  circumstances&quot;.&nbsp; Sarenia replied.&nbsp; We could all 
                  now breath again.&nbsp; In time we were all resurrected by Medikar, 
                  and clustered in the tower. <br>
                  <br>
                  We now found ourselves in a small empty room.&nbsp; Radalas 
                  would go out and pull in a bat.&nbsp; Battle would rage on for 
                  what seemed like hours Sarenia and I would do our feeble small 
                  parts but the bulk of the battle on this level was clearly in 
                  the hands of our more experienced brethern.&nbsp; Finally a 
                  bat died only to bring forth a vampire. &nbsp; More fighting 
                  and healings and eventually it too died.&nbsp; A single battle 
                  with one took what seemed like 10 minutes although it probably 
                  could have been just a 3 or 5 in any case it became clear why 
                  I was commanded to die.&nbsp; Doing one was very difficult when 
                  we had 8 - 12 of course we could not survive.<br>
                  <br>
                  Several more battles raged on and then about this time Drukinpinoch 
                  requested to rejoin us. I thought back on the trials and deaths 
                  that got us up there, and wondered, how on earth would that 
                  be managed. It couldn&#146;t be, and we had to carry on without 
                  him.<br>

                  gave some quick instructions on the do&#146;s an don&#146;ts 
                  of facing Tserrina. Tserrina is the queen of the tower, a nasty 
                  vampiress with 100 percent resistance to magic, and a bad attitude. 
                  We began to think of her as Sarenia's evil twin.&nbsp; Rad began 
                  pulling bats, which spawned vampires at their deaths. My job 
                  was to snare the vamps and avoid aggros while nuking. At last 
                  I seemed to get the hang of this, although none of my snares 
                  held. Then to my surprise I DINGED 38, and lo and behold the 
                  snares began to work. <br>
                  <br>
                  At last a bat exploed and out came the dreaded Tserrina.&nbsp; 
                  Knowing we could do little agains her Sarenia and I did what 
                  little we could.&nbsp; Sarenia would add damage shields and 
                  speed buffs to the melee fighters and add a rune here and there 
                  only to be eaten away by a single hit from the dreaded beast.&nbsp; 
                  Suddenly Sarenia went linkdead I did all that I could - cast 
                  my feeble O&#146;keils, damage shield on the fighters. The battle 
                  was long and hard, with Salfadorn, and Medikar casting heals. 
                  Eventually she fell with a hideous cry. A moment later Sarenia 
                  reappeared. <br>
                  <br>
                  I&#146;m back, did I miss anything?&#148;&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  Tserrina&nbsp; dropped her staff, and it was unanimously decided 
                  that Sarenia should receive it. Eventually Medikar had to leave 
                  to wrap presents for his daughters birthday. &nbsp; He left 
                  us in Radalas capable hands and we continued to do battle.&nbsp; 
                  As the hours wained on Radalas annonced that after the next 
                  3 bats he would be leaving.&nbsp; We killed the first two and 
                  now we were down to the final battle of the night.&nbsp; <br>
                  </font></p>
                <p align="left" class="Normal"><font face="Arial"><br>
                  We waited as the last bat got lower and lower in health.&nbsp; 
                  Sarenia yelled out &quot;Come on evil sister be there, be there&quot;.&nbsp; 
                  The bat died and once again we were faced with Tserrina's evil 
                  wrath.&nbsp; Once again the epic battle was waged our brave 
                  guildmates pounded the evil queen and once again Sarenia went 
                  Linkdead.&nbsp; Just as before only minutes after the evil queen 
                  died - in pops Sarenia.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  I'm back, did I miss anything again?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Coincidence perhaps. But perhaps Sarenia and Tserrina cannot 
                  exist in the same plane together. Hoping for a robe but instead 
                  we got her necklace. Most of the guild was unimpressed but it 
                  was a far cry better than anything that Eldeberon and Sarenia 
                  presntly had so we were grateful for the gift. With that we 
                  called it a night with one last port by myself for the group 
                  to the dreadlands. <br>
                  <br>
                  In conclusion, TOFS was a wonderful time, at least speaking 
                  for myself and Sarenia. We both gained a level each, and learned 
                  much about teamwork in general. Sarenia also managed to walk 
                  away with a nice new necklace, the powerful staff of Teserenia 
                  and the Student&#146;s homework, while I had acquired the teacher&#146;s 
                  syllabus, which filled an empty slot in my inventory. Mostly 
                  however, and more importantly, it was just a whole lot of fun.</font></p>

                  have now been on three forays into the Tower of Frozen Shadow 
                  (TOFS) in Iceclad, and I think I am finally starting to understand 
                  what goes on there. I know, with 209 intelligence and a head 
                  as tall as the Highhold Pass cliff, you'd think I'd catch on 
                  quicker, but I am still a relative newbie to the guild. Regardless, 
                  for good or ill, right or wrong, this is what I have concluded 
                  from my experiences in the haunted tower. </span></font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
                  begin with ToFS's is a death trap. It has multiple mobs that 
                  swarm and few ways out. The few exits that do exists port you 
                  outside the tower where hungry snow dervishes are waiting in 
                  droves to pummel you. Because of the key system, if you die 
                  you might never be able to claim your body. As a result TOFS 
                  is a VERY scary place. As such it is the prefect place to scare 
                  the cr -- I mean, &quot;train&quot; new DC recruits on tactics 
                  and group play. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dragonchow 
                  has, in point of fact, been using ToFS's as a training ground. 
                  The idea is to take mid-level members, who may, or may not have 
                  had much experience with grouping or raiding, and hone their 
                  skills to a quality where they will be an asset to a &quot;real&quot; 
                  guild raid, rather than a hindrance. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  technique is to have two groups, one high-level and one mid-level. 
                  The high level is there only to support the mid-level in he 
                  event of emergency (and no doubt to obtain a good belly laugh 
                  at the sorry antics of the less experienced). The mid-level 
                  group is designed to be comprised with proper melee, caster, 
                  healer elements and then let loose on the second floor to fight 
                  as they wish. The high-level group watches the action and offer 
                  helpful suggestions as to how we can improve our performance. 
                  I have always found their suggestions to be considerate and 
                  politely delivered, (which I am very impressed with considering 
                  the political delicacy needed to offer advice without sounding 
                  like &quot;Hey! What are you an idiot! How did you get to level 
                  40 pulling that crap!&quot; ) and, for me at least, very helpful 
                  -- as I rarely group with melees and needed the advice. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 
                  the mid group gets a rhythm down, and initial rough edges are 
                  smoothed, it is time to take on a greater challenge. I do believe 
                  Radalas, (who was part of two of the TOFS adventures I have 
                  been on), has something of the &quot;sadistic prankster&quot; 
                  in his nature. With the intent of preparing the new recruits 
                  (perhaps a poor choice of term as some of the mid-level players 
                  have high level mains who have been in DC for some time now, 
                  but you get my drift), to be able to face the worst case scenario 
                  Radalas has purposely trained us with a horde of ghostly students--and 
                  I mean a train! I believe he has pulled the entire library on 
                  us before. Radalas' version of the Cobiashi Maru test. Keep 
                  in mind he has several high level clerics standing by to give 
                  full rezzes if anyone dies. Although it might appear that way, 
                  he's not <i>totally</i> insane. </font></p>

                  of the raid. It was his first time as leader and I believe Radalas 
                  was providing him guidance. So we newbies, were being lead by 
                  a raw lieutenant into the dreadful tower. Sylen, I felt did 
                  a great job, albeit he seemed a tad under confident, apologizing 
                  for delay and poor organization, but honestly I felt he was 
                  doing fine. I have run small groups myself and understand the 
                  insane difficulties involved in getting everyone in order in 
                  a timely fashion. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ToFS 
                  always seems to start in chaos. I say it &quot;seems&quot; to, 
                  but appearances can be deceiving. There is no organization on 
                  the first floor because none is needed. The high level members 
                  busy themselves killing the mobs to obtain the keys needed, 
                  while the rest are waiting for the late comers to arrive. The 
                  newbies feel confused because they have little to do and no 
                  direction, but that soon changes, and I was relieved when Sylen 
                  began to announce teams. I rather felt like I was back in school 
                  being picked for dodgeball. As usual I was picked last and then 
                  switched between teams (lol). </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/tofsrevisited2.jpg" align="left" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="335">We 
                  went to the second floor, where we practiced pulling a few and 
                  had no problem at all. So we quickly moved on to the third floor. 
                  We fought there until we had such a good rhythm it was getting 
                  boring. Radalas must have realized this, or maybe &quot;he&quot; 
                  was just getting bored-still I like to think Rad honestly was 
                  trying to strengthen our sense of self-confidence and force 
                  us to learn how to act in dire peril. It is, after all, far 
                  better to practice proper defensive procedures when you have 
                  an army of high level clerics standing by than when you are 
                  without a safety net. So it was Radalas' intent to push us to 
                  the limit. He began by training the ghosts from the second level 
                  up to us. He failed however bringing but one measly student. 
                  So he then came up with a nastier plan. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
                  proposed that we all go up to the fourth floor, an area that 
                  I think, Rad thought, we were incapable of holding at our level. 
                  So we all went up, but Rad (I assume) secretly ordered that 
                  the high-level group would remain behind. He abandoned us purposely 
                  to see if we would sink or swim. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  moment we all arrived and none of the high-level party did, 
                  Sarenia and I knew what was going on. It was obvious and not 
                  altogether unexpected. Still things got very tense. I don't 
                  know what Rad was thinking exactly, I haven't had the opportunity 
                  to discuss his intent or expectations but I suspect he was looking 
                  to see if members would panic, run, gate, abandon comrades, 
                  freeze up, etc. After we all died I am sure he would have resurrected 
                  us all and perhaps then explained what we did wrong and how 
                  we could have done things better. However that was not the case.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
                  the astonishment of all, we few, we proud, we brave little Dragonchows 
                  stood our ground. We zoned in and faced wave after wave of pops, 
                  and held them off in cool, courageous fashion. Few, if any of 
                  us, had ever been to this level (I know Sarenia, Cabbz and I 
                  had not), and had no idea what to expect and yet every one of 
                  us acted in perfect teamwork. The invisible shadows were a big 
                  surprise. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pawur, 
                  the ogre shadowknight, stood steadfast before us fending off 
                  the onslaught! Jaszire, the shaman, stood beside him clubbing 
                  with his staff. Sarenia, the enchantress, cast rapid fire mez 
                  and stuns to keep the hounds at bay. I, the wizard, timed my 
                  nukes to avoid agros and wiped out the berserk stage of the 
                  fight. Cabbz, the shaman, healed, buffed and defuffed, and occasionally 
                  joined the melee. Tanjure, our cleric, adeptly kept us all alive 
                  with heals. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
                  at last the others joined us, we showed hardly a scratch, as 
                  we sat around a massive pile of undead corpses. Rad was impressed 
                  I think, and perhaps a bit disappointed to.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
                  can't kill you guys,&quot; he told us, &quot;You're just too 
                  good!&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which 
                  left us all feeling pretty damn proud I think.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                  was getting late then and we all called it a night, a night 
                  without a single death. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
                  if you ever decide to take TOFS 101 with professor Radalas, 
                  keep in mind you will learn a lot, assuming the lesson doesn't 
                  kill you. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks 
                  to all who came and helped with this training exercise. Special 
                  thanks to Exavier, Lindsay, Scalezz, and Sylen, who sacrificed 
                  their time to do little more than play nurse maid to the rest 
                  of us. And thanks to Rad whose failure to kill us really made 
                  the night great. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We

                  Eldeberon and I awake in the cold icy snows of Eastern Wastes.&nbsp; 
                  It was a hard night battling the dreaded Rygor Elites the night 
                  before and if it wasn't for the fact that they kept out numbering 
                  us they would all be dead.&nbsp; We fought side by side with 
                  our old friend Cabbaz who we are still trying to get into Dragonchow 
                  (He has a standing offer at a guild of RL friends and we are 
                  trying to lure him away from that).</span></font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eldeberon 
                  has been enjoying quad kiting Ulthorks but since I have little 
                  to do in that but collect up the experience and a few tusks 
                  here and there I was not up for it.&nbsp; When Eldeberon mentioned 
                  Crystal Caverns I jumped at the opportunity.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now don't get me wrong I love my jboots (in a purely practical 
                  way) they are not fashionable but they do allow me to run fast 
                  and it was such a grueling experience to get them.&nbsp; Still 
                  I wanted something more fitting for my feet something pretty 
                  and delicate -- I wanted crystal slippers and Crystal Caverns 
                  held just the big bad spider who would give them to me.&nbsp; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We had just arrived at the site when we got a tell from Cabbz 
                  -&quot; what were we up to?&quot;, &quot;Hunting spiders in 
                  CC&quot; was our reply.&nbsp; &quot;Need any help?&quot;.&nbsp; 
                  I respond &quot;Well only if it is the right kind of help - 
                  did you get a tell from Crisbie that he is coming?&quot;&nbsp; 
                  This is a long running gag with us Crisbie is by far one of 
                  the worst and most immature players we've ever had the displeasure 
                  of grouping with and he has been the butt of our jokes for a 
                  long time.&nbsp; &quot;Of course we want you along - come on 
                  down&quot; and shortly we were joined with our dear friend.<br>
                  <br>
                  We worked the hallway and although the shear number of spiders 
                  was overwhelming we did quite well and were able to clear it 
                  and keep it clear without too much trouble. &nbsp; Finally it 
                  was all clear and we peaked in the room.&nbsp; There is the 
                  queen surrounded by 4 minions.&nbsp; Ah certain death but I 
                  know she has my shoes so we start to plot strategies. &nbsp; 
                  A plan is hatched where I attempt to mez her and run most of 
                  the mobs to the dwarf town leaving Cabbz and Eldeberon to mop 
                  up the queen.&nbsp; It will most certainly mean death but we 
                  might take her with us.&nbsp; Finally we decide we need help 
                  and turn to our guild.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                  quick glance shows no one in our zone or anywhere near it.&nbsp; 
                  Shoot! we are on our own.&nbsp; Then Eldeberon sends a tell 
                  to Freyana - All he says is Sarenia and Eldeberon need some 
                  help and without inquiring any further she responds &quot;OMW&quot;.&nbsp; 
                  Once again we are amazed and impressed by the generosity of 
                  the home we now call guild.&nbsp; She is all the way on the 
                  moon but drops what she is doing comes to Thurg for a bind then 
                  meets up with us at the spiders.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 
                  this time we have to clear hall trash again and we do it easily.&nbsp; 
                  Then two escape and head for the queen and Freyana jumps in 
                  the water to finish them off.&nbsp; Unfortunately we got an 
                  unexpected argo and the next thing we knew the queen and countless 
                  spiders had descended upon us.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  battle ensued and although we fought desperately we did not 
                  have time to prepare and it looked grim.&nbsp; The Queen was 
                  dead and Freyana was able to loot the corpse but not before 
                  dying herself.&nbsp; In the end Eldeberon, Cabbz and Freyana 
                  lay dead and I only escaped by a gate at the last moment. &nbsp; 
                  Now I have to live with the guilt.&nbsp; I survived while my 
                  comrades fell. &nbsp; Not only that but I had dragged Freyana 
                  away for assistance and got her killed in the process.&nbsp; 
                  Needless to say I felt terrible.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
                  the good side there was a very nice Cleric next door at the 
                  geos who was more than willing to help us out, and a short time 
                  later we had 3 rezzes and were back at it again.&nbsp; About 
                  this time we noticed another DC in the zone. Kendrick had just 
                  popped in and we asked if he would like to join.&nbsp; He did 
                  and now we were poised to do some serious damage which we did.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                  laid waste to the area. Spider bodies stacked up like cord wood. 
                  The queen and here other high level arachnids died left and 
                  right.&nbsp; Between Freyana's Mana song and my Clarity we were 
                  always at full mana and nothing stood in our way.&nbsp; Several 
                  queens were killed but no shoes still we were having fun with 
                  good comrades.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suddenly 
                  while we were cleaning up some yard trash a monk runs by.&nbsp; 
                  When our battle is done I look into the room and there he is 
                  KS'ing our queen.&nbsp; How rude I thought and we started a 
                  conversation with him. &nbsp; Soon the whole zone chimes in 
                  that he has been KS'ing their areas as well. &nbsp; His name 
                  is Fosgate and a member of the Guardians of Light. The conversation 
                  wages on in ooc and it is apparent that this guy although high 
                  level has the mindset of a newbie wanting only self gratification 
                  and no thought or care for others or a sense of &quot;nice play&quot;.&nbsp; 
                  </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such 
                  behavior should not go unchecked. &nbsp; Freyana finds an officer 
                  in the guild and reports him.&nbsp; I also speak to Morloc (the 
                  officer) that he should have a talk with Mr. Fosgate since he 
                  obviously needs to be taught better manners than he showed.&nbsp; 
                  Morloc asks me if I can get to a Wizzy spire sometime that night 
                  - &quot;Yes I can but why I ask?&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&quot;I'll 
                  give you your glass slippers.&quot; &nbsp;he says.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
                  at first I'm impressed that this guild member will make good 
                  on bad done by a member of his guild.&nbsp; But then I think 
                  it is not his responsibility to clean up after another's mess.&nbsp; 
                  I thank him for his kind offer but inform him the loot is not 
                  the point.&nbsp; The point is how unenjoyable Fosgate made this 
                  evening for me, my teammates, and several other people in the 
                  zone.&nbsp; I politely decline his offer though thank him for 
                  the sentiment.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Morloc 
                  informs me I'm not the first to complain about Fosgate - then 
                  why don't you boot him I say.&nbsp; He says he has no proof 
                  so what can he do.&nbsp; I offer to send him a copy of the log 
                  I turned on as the conversation became unpleasant.&nbsp; He 
                  gives me his e-mail.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
                  that excitement done we continue to kill Kendrick brings in 
                  his monk. Too young to receive experience but she had a good 
                  time whacking on spiders with Freyana.&nbsp; They were like 
                  two women killing machines putting the best of any male melee 
                  to shame.&nbsp; By 2:00 am we got our last queen pop. &nbsp; 
                  Still&nbsp; no slippers but overall a good time had by all (With 
                  the exception of Mr. Fosgate who I plan to be &quot;watching&quot; 
                  in the future and doing what I can to expand his reputation 
                  to those around him to see him for what he truly is an immature 
                  and selfish little man). We picked up 3 crystaline robes, a 
                  web shield, a spider fur choker, the queens pally weapon, and 
                  lots of runes, gems and pages to keep Eldeberon and myself busy. 
                  &nbsp; </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
                  in conclusion I would like to thank Freyana and Kendrick/Kixim 
                  for their assistance although we did not get the shoes I got 
                  to spend time with some guild mates I've not fought with before 
                  and I enjoyed your company and your skills.&nbsp; Also thanks 
                  to Cabbz who is always a welcome pleasure to any group I have 
                  with him.&nbsp; If you see him about tell him how great&nbsp; 
                  DC is and that he has to join up.&nbsp; And if you happened 
                  to See Fosgate in a zone warn those around you to beware and 
                  be ready to /ignore - he can be quite annoying, although the 
                  other /ooc's to him are quite entertaining.&nbsp; </font></p>

                  met up in Burning Woods, near the Skyfire pass, we prepared 
                  to do battle. The first run at ole Ixi was with 65 people of 
                  50th level or higher. The first pull was long and arduous as 
                  Leifanng pulled the giant elemental to the camp. Shouting 'Here 
                  I come' and 'Party Time' rang out several times as she made 
                  her way to us. Soon the beast was in sight. </span></font></p>

                  MARCH 28-Last night is a perfect example of how a bad night 
                  can be turned around by a handful of Chow. </span></font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eldeberon 
                  was in the city of Thurgadin working on his Phenofocus quest 
                  when he bumped into Woodweaver. We started an impromptu game 
                  of tag, (Which Woody reminded me he would win since he had track), 
                  then I got a /tell from a stranger requesting to be ported to 
                  Emerald Jungle. I did so and then gated back. No sooner had 
                  I returned when I received another request. Having the spell 
                  already loaded, I agreed to port him too, and Sarenia went along 
                  for the ride. She really wanted to return to Lower Guk, but 
                  I didn't feel comfortable going down there with just the two 
                  of us. Instead we thought we would wander EJ, as we had never 
                  visited there before. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                  encountered a Soulsapper and engaged in fighting, however Sarenia 
                  hadn't time to memorize her fighting spells and things went 
                  badly. No deaths, but a bit of a scare. While recovering, I 
                  received another request for a punt and sent them on their merry 
                  way (big night for ports and punts). Then we explored EJ. A 
                  trakraptor jumped us from behind. Roots failed, miscommunications 
                  lead to mistakes and Sarenia and I gated out. I appeared in 
                  front of the Thug bank with just a nib of health. The fact that 
                  I was alive was all that saved me from depression and frustration. 
                  I started playing in less than a good mood and then two simple 
                  encounters that should have been easy kills, nearly resulted 
                  in our deaths. I wasn't happy. Then as I sat there collecting 
                  my thoughts, I noticed I was being bandaged. I stood up and 
                  looked and there was MrPain. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Who 
                  did this to you? And do we need to deliver some payback?&quot; 
                  He said with that devilish Iksar grin of his. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                  made me feel a little better. Running into an unexpected friend 
                  usually does. I tried to thank MrPain only to receive an AFK 
                  message. Apparently someone was visiting MrPain and he had to 
                  travel down five flights to open the front door because his 
                  elevator was broken. I had to pause there and reflect on the 
                  size of house MrPain lives in, and how a thirtysomething Iksar 
                  warrior can afford such a palace-perhaps he is subletting from 
                  Teroth. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Healed 
                  up. I tried to forget EJ and resumed my Pheno quest. As part 
                  of it I needed to pick up a rock deep in the Wurm Cave. So casting 
                  invis I headed down. I picked up the item, which is very heavy 
                  and encumbered me, and began to waddle out. No sooner had I 
                  done this when my invis broke without warning and I was facing 
                  three wurms and who knows how many littering the exit corridor. 
                  I tried to gate, but that is difficult when three 16 foot wurms 
                  are playing handball with your body against the walls of their 
                  cave. I gave up on casting spells and fired off my Jboots and 
                  tried running the gauntlet out. He's at the twenty, the forty&#133;oh! 
                  He's down! </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Needless 
                  to say I was whacked dead. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ok, 
                  now I was pissed. I had, had it. Scalezz had agreed to go with 
                  Sarenia to Lower Guk, and I told her that was good because I 
                  wasn't. I could see it was just one of those times when everything 
                  was going to go wrong. So I decided I was logging for the night. 
                  At least I would log right after I retrieved my body. (I never 
                  can understand those who log leaving their unlooted bodies.) 
                  So here I am back in front of the Thurg bank, depressed and 
                  irritated, and who do I see? Woody. Wait, I think, Woody is 
                  a druid, and my Jboots are on my body. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Woody! 
                  Do you think you can step outside and give me a sow?&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sure,&quot; 
                  he says. &quot;Humm. You don't look so good. You die?&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                  exited Thurg and I wait for Woody to cast sow. I am going to 
                  get my body and call it a night. Go sulk somewhere, watch some 
                  mindless television, or just kick the dog. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Woody 
                  casts his spell and I am levitated. Oh that's nice, I thought, 
                  he is giving me levitation as well. What a guy. I continue to 
                  wait for the sow. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;No,&quot; 
                  my short answers reflected my mood. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm 
                  still waiting on the sow, but Woody is just sitting there. </font></p>

                  you at least port us to Guk?&quot; Sarenia asks now that Scalezz 
                  has joined her. Both are sitting just outside beyond the waterfall. 
                  </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Of 
                  course, just let me get my body first,&quot; I tell her. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
                  is taking Woody so long? I mean I have heard Druids are rumored 
                  to be a bit flighty, but this just wasn't like Woody. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You 
                  want me to follow you?&quot; Kinowin says to me.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Follow 
                  me? I turn around and see a little halfling. What? was he offering 
                  to come help me fetch my body? I don't need help, dragging my 
                  body, I thought, all I need is the sow. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Woody 
                  then suggests giving me something (I forgot what) saying, &quot;you 
                  could use that to pay the cleric for the rez.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pay 
                  the cleric? Was Woody arranging a rez for me? Was that what 
                  was taking him so long? I didn't-wait a minute. I spun around 
                  and looked at the halfling again. I /whotarget him and discovered 
                  he was a 55th level cleric. Doh!</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Are 
                  you offering me a rez?&quot; I asked.</font></p>

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Are

                  sow, isn't that why I dragged your butt out here in the first 
                  place? Of course I didn't say that, after all he was doing me 
                  a favor, even if it was taking an incredibly odd length of time.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then 
                  I read a message from Woody, something about &quot;&#133;levitation,

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                  glance down at the tornado icon, and the little candle ignites 
                  above Eldeberon's head. I had heard about Dead Man Floating 
                  being several buffs in one, I had no idea Druids had a similar 
                  spell. So Woody HAD sowed me, in fact he had gone several steps 
                  beyond just sowing me. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
                  off I ran. I found my body and dragged it back. The cleric rezed 
                  me. Already I was feeling better, although several degrees more 
                  foolish. I reached into my coin purse. It was filled with plat 
                  from the earlier ports. Now I am not terribly familiar with 
                  resurrections. As a rule I don't seek them out. In fact, Eldeberon 
                  had his first performed on him not too long ago in TOFS by Medikar 
                  who didn't charge. So I really didn't know how much to pay. 
                  I grabbed up 50 plat and held it out to the cleric, who promptly 
                  refused. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Don't

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Website? 
                  I looked closer at the cleric. No tag. Humm.</font></p>

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aside 
                  from feeling like a fool, I had my body and hadn't lost much 
                  experience at all, nor was I even out any money. Thanks to DC, 
                  I was suddenly feeling much better. I thanked Kinowin, and returned 
                  to the bank in Thurg to drop off the terribly heavy rock I got 
                  in the Wurm Cave, and while there I spotted Woody again. </font></p>

                  Scalezz and I then went to Lower Guk. Now, most of you read 
                  the earlier account of our previous visit with a full team, 
                  so my expectations of repeated deaths with just the three of 
                  us casters was, I felt, not unfounded. To my amazement, we reached 
                  the Sage Room and cleared it. Then we went and cleared the Executioners 
                  Room and obtained a Hood. Then we cleared the halls, then we 
                  returned to the Sage room and cleared it and obtained the chord/belt. 
                  Then we cleared the hallways again. During all this Sarenia, 
                  Scalezz and I repeatedly were going LD. In fact, it seemed that 
                  all of us couldn't stay in the game at the same time. Regardless, 
                  we three silly little casters, with no real healer or melee, 
                  ruled in Lower Guk, where none of us had ever really fought 
                  before. (when ever we went too far away from the Sage room searching 
                  for pulls we would get lost). </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                  the end, after little more than an hour and a half we ported 
                  out of Lower Guk with two nice drops, almost a gold in exp and 
                  no deaths. </font></p>

                  of the guild. Thanks all. And a special thanks to Woody and 
                  Kinowin for their generosity and patience to a stupid, pissed-off

                <p class="Normal">On behalf of our beloved miniature rogue, Dragonchow 
                  turned out in number in Kithcor forest with one intent--to kill 
                  the General. His name is General V`ghera, a Dark Elf who cons 
                  red to level 60s. He has 32000 hit points, hits for 200, procs 
                  for 500, and has an incredibly powerul harm touch. Not the kinda 
                  guy you want to meet in a dark forest, but one our intrepid 
                  Rogue needs to slay for the last part of his epic. </p>
                <p class="Normal">Now I don't profess to be the most informed 
                  participant involved, and at level 47, I was there mostly to 
                  report on the events, and play Jimmy Olsen. Nevertheless I did 
                  manage to get a few whacks in, and even scored a critical blast 
                  against the old general&#133;but I am getting ahead of myself. 
                  As I was saying I wasn't running the show, and can't be certain 
                  all that was happening, but I was there, and this is how things 
                  seemed to me.</p>

                  called all available, 50s and above Chow to Kithcor. A large 
                  number arrived and it was the first time I had seen many of 
                  the faces that went with the names. For me it was like being 
                  at the Oscars. Oh look there's Leifanng! I loved her in &quot;Feign 
                  Death II&quot;, and over there is Uniqe, and oh my, the man-of-the-hour 
                  himself, Brodda! Oh dear, I didn't know he was bald! And he 
                  seemed so much taller in guild speak.&quot;</p>
                <p class="Normal">We all assembled at the zone to WC, and there 
                  Rad listed out groups. </p>
                <p class="Normal">&quot;Ok guys listen for your group. First person 
                  on the group is the group leader.&quot;</p>
                <p class="Normal">I sat and waited impatiently for my name. So 
                  many great heroes together in one place I wondered who I'd be 
                  grouped with?</p>
                <p class="Normal">&quot;Group 1 Purti Tyrrund, Leifangg, medikar, 
                  candywen, Iilae.&quot; Radalas barked. &quot;Group 2 Sunu, Macey

                  Sebon Teroth Indra. Group 4 Brodda Crux Chaintalker Enilate 
                  Exavier Uniqe&quot;</p>
                <p class="Normal">There was a pause. Everyone forming their assigned 
                  groups. I looked at Rad and blinked. Rad spotted me and nodded. 
                  &quot;Eld and Slej you guys will be alone, so group together 
                  but try not to gain agro. You are welcome to try your lure spells

                <p class="Normal"><img src="images/epic6.jpg" width="770" height="310"></p>
                <p class="Normal">Slej? I looked around. Finally I spotted Slejhamyr, 
                  a 46 level halfling and invited him. I had never met Slej before. 
                  He wasn't even on the guild member's listing, but he seemed 
                  a pleasant fellow.</p>
                <p class="Normal">&quot;What class are you?&quot; I asked.</p>
                <p> <span class="Normal">&quot;Druid&quot;, Slej replied. &quot;A 
                  gimp one at that. Brodda's been my best RL friend for about 
                  16 years, so I wasn't allowed to miss this.&quot;</span></p>
                <p class="Normal">I suppose we were both gimps, what ever that 
                  was exactly, and I immediately felt a kinship with my little 
                  brother in arms. Perhaps because of his casual humility, or 
                  maybe it was just because he was the only one in the zone who 
                  was a lower level than I. &quot;We'll be the last ones alive 
                  you know,&quot; I told him. &quot;And we'll be the ones to bring 
                  the general down.&quot; We both had a good laugh. </p>
                <p align="right" class="Normal"><img src="images/epic3.jpg" width="518" height="321" align="right"></p>
                <p class="Normal">The army--and army it was--no greater troop 
                  of warriors has been seen since the sacking for the city of 
                  Troy, moved out. We marched to the north and west until we reached 
                  the tunnel of Rivervale, and there Radalas set our standard. 
                  The golden dragon on the blue field flapped defiantly in the 
                  misty haze of the stained evil forest. In the distance the sound 
                  of creatures moved. From my youth I had been so trained to fear 
                  these trees that even a bixie drone's buzz made me shiver. I 
                  crept up the hillside near the zone exit and huddled tight. 
                  Radalas our fearless leader stood in front like Achilles of 
                  old, arranging the troops. Brodda, with his shinny little head, 
                  strode up and down thanking those he saw for attending. Each 
                  one in turn offering him comments of good luck. </p>
                <p class="Normal">&quot;Who is main slower and main chanter?&quot; 
                  Medikar inquired.<br>
                  &quot;Main chanter is Candywen main slower is Akkera,&quot; 
                  Radalas explained<br>
                  &quot;Okies will die for Brodda&quot;, Akkera said.<br>
                  &quot;No, no.. we'll have none of that Akky,&quot; Brodda replied.</p>
                <p class="Normal">Now if I get this correctly, there is a cabin 
                  in the Kithcor forest that houses a band of very nasty Dark 
                  Elves. The idea is to clear the cabin, but leave one dark elf 
                  behind for the rogue to trade his &quot;box&quot; to. After 
                  this the General spawns in the house, and needs to be trained 
                  to the waiting army. The &quot;Brigader&quot; is the best one 
                  to leave in the cabin since a rogue can sneak up behind the 
                  Brig, trade, and be in a position where the general won't immediately 
                  see him, thus allowing him to re-hide. With this in mind the 
                  monks were sent to pull individual mobs from the cabin. Tyrrund 
                  and Leifanng did the dirty work here. </p>
                <p class="Normal">The first mob was War Priestess T`zan. The army 
                  clustered around her and began to battle. I assumed she would 
                  drop in seconds, yet five minutes seemed to go by and still 
                  she stood. I watched her health fall and rise, fall again only 
                  to rise again. I tried casting my lure spell, only to have it 
                  resisted over and over. Clearly it seemed I would be of no use 
                  here. Another dark elf also showed up by the name of Advisor 
                  C`zatl, and things were heating up. Then as the priestess was 
                  low in health I cast again and to my surprise she took damage! 
                  Ah-hah! Perhaps there was a link. Unfortunately by that time 
                  I was out of mana. The DC killed the Priestess, but Klothe and 
                  Sebon were dead. </p>
                <p class="Normal"><img src="images/epic4.jpg" width="518" height="281" align="left"></p>
                <p class="Normal">&quot;Well so far I have done nothing except 
                  debuff one,&quot; Slej told me miserably. I was pleased to report 
                  I had managed to actually do damage. Weak and feeble certainly, 
                  but some. With Slej, I was starting to feel more like one of 
                  a pair of LOTR hobbits in the battle of Gondor than an Erudite 
                  wizard. </p>
                <p class="Normal">Next came Tasi V`ghera. This time I held back 
                  and waited until I saw the health bar drop below half, then 
                  I began to nuke. The first blast hit for full damage!</p>
                <p class="Normal">&quot;Akky down!&quot; Leifanng cried. And somewhere 
                  in the havoc of the field below me Akkera fell dead at Tasi 
                  V' ghera's feet. </p>
                <p class="Normal">I began casting Enticement of Flame again Tasi 
                  V`ghera was hit by non-melee for 360 points of damage. Tasi 
                  V`ghera succumbed to the enticement of flame. Then the dark 
                  elf fell and I saw the amazing message, <i>&quot;You have slain 
                  Tasi V`ghera!&quot; </i>I was stunned, but in a good way.</p>
                <p class="Normal">&quot;I actually got a couple of blasts on that 
                  one!&quot; Slej told me. </p>
                <p class="Normal">Slej left my group then and I tired to re-invite 
                  him thinking he had left accidentally. </p>
                <p class="Normal">&quot;I'm the healer in one of the other groups 
                  now&quot; Slejhamyr told me, then added fearfully,&quot;Somebody 
                  gonna die&quot; </p>
                <p class="Normal">I was alone in my group of one. Sylen had been 
                  apart of the group for a brief while, but left. </p>
                <p class="Normal">A few more dark elves and a few more deaths-Iilae 
                  and Indra fell. Then in came the Adjutant D`kan</p>
                <p class="Normal">I began casting Enticement of Flame.<br>
                  <i>Adjutant D`kan was hit by non-melee for 360 points of damage</i>.<br>
                  <i>Adjutant D`kan succumbed to the enticement of flame</i>, 
                  and once more the message, &quot;<i>You have slain Adjutant 
                  D`kan!</i>&quot; I cheered my own success, then I looked upon 
                  the field and saw the cost.</p>
                <p class="Normal">&quot;Uniqe LD&quot;' Brodda told us<br>
                  &quot;Dang...' Radalas cursed<br>
                  &quot;Slej and Teroth down,&quot; reported Salavar.</p>
                <p class="Normal">Slej! Not Slej! I looked down and saw the little 
                  guy's body. Poor fellow. I consoled myself with the knowledge 
                  that at least it was quick. The good news was Brig was alone. 
                  It was finally time for the main feature, time to face the General, 
                  but there was a catch. In order to trade his box, Brodda needed 
                  to have invisibility cast on him after he opened the trade window, 
                  but before he traded. Iilae was sent in to invis Brodda, but 
                  something went wrong.</p>
                <p class="Normal">&quot;Are you casting invis on me Iilae?&quot; 
                  Brodda asked Iilae.<br>
                  &quot;Yes, trying to,&quot; Iilae replied.<br>
                  &quot;It says I am protected, yet am not invis.&quot;<br>
                  &quot;lilae he needs to be in our group,&quot; Tyrrund told 
                  them.<br>
                  Brodda began laughing. &quot;It's the little things that get

                <p class="Normal">Being part of Brodda's group, Exavier was sent 
                  in, but was killed when an undead spotted him. <br>
                  It was then that Brodda was told to forget the invis, make the 
                  trade and take the death. He tried, and died, but the general 
                  never popped. Brodda was dragged out and rezed, and went in 
                  again. The lucky thing was he still had the box.</p>
                <p class="Normal">Everyone gathered again and went in for a second 
                  try. Exavier went forward to invis once more, but the Brig appeared 
                  and killed him.</p>
                <p class="Normal">Brodda slipped up behind the Brigader, and deftly, 
                  as the master thief he is, he began the trade. &quot;In trade 
                  window now.. he's scowls. I need invis now!'<br>
                  From outside the cabin Tyrrund shouted, 'turn in'<br>
                  Leifanng echoed the sentiment, 'turn in'<br>
                  Tyrrund then reconsidered, 'no'<br>
                  Brodda, with sweat dappling his shinny head whispered, 'cannot 
                  trade until it's not KoS.. must be invis, or all for naught'<br>
                  Radalas said, 'agreed'<br>
                  Tyrrund sighed and nodded, 'he will lose his piece'<br>
                  &quot;Bleh&quot; Leifanng exclaimed, &quot;brodda down!&quot;<br>
                  &quot;God damn it!&quot; Radalas cursed swinging his sword at 
                  the blades of grass before him. Everyone in the vicinity took 
                  a step back from him. <br>
                  Brodda announced, &quot;still have piece.&quot;<br>
                  Gryphin shouted, 'whats goin on?'<br>
                  &quot;Leif drag ex and brodda,&quot; Radalas ordered.<br>
                  Leifanng said, &quot;someone get an inviser with brodda&quot;<br>
                  Radalas said, &quot;or leif drag ex and ty drag brodda&quot;<br>
                  Leifanng replied, 'I'll get ex'</p>
                <p class="Normal">I felt stupid just sitting there. They needed 
                  a caster who could cast invis. I might not be able do much damage 
                  to the mobs, but I could cast an invisibility spell. Besides, 
                  if I died in the process, the group wasn't loosing anything. 
                </p>
                <p class="Normal">I asked Radalas, &quot;Do you want me to group 
                  with brodda and invis him and that way if I die who cares?&quot;</p>
                <p class="Normal">Radalas told me, 'no.. its not that... just

                <p class="Normal">Is there time to drag ex back to camp?' Leifanng 
                  asked.<br>
                  Tyrrund said, 'ok leif and I rdy'<br>
                  &quot;No leif keep ex there for now,&quot; Radalas said. &quot;Lets 
                  do this soon... rez timer on corpse about to run out'<br>
                  Brodda called out, &quot;turning in!&quot;<br>
                  Radalas said, &quot;quickly but do it carefuly&quot;</p>
                <p class="Normal">There was a pause, and everyone held their breath.

                  in the deep piney thatch, and raised his sword. The General 
                  came charging into the glade, furious. Radalas stepped forward 
                  and swung. The sound of metal on steel rang harshly, and the

                  before the general left Rad and turned on Sunu. Sunu dropped 
                  like a stone. It returned to Rad and before long Rad fell. </p>

                  Brodda lost his box, and will have to start his epic over. Most 
                  everyone at the site was killed. It was late, and after the 
                  resurrections and after punting those who needed it, DC called 
                  it a night. It was my first &quot;real&quot; raid, and it had 
                  been bloody, but I suppose that is why they call it Bloody Kithcor. 
                  While I feel bad for Brodda, I am pleased to have served what 
                  little purpose I could, and it was an honor to die with such 
                  distinguished company. Long live Dragonchow!</p>

                  until now I had grown accustom to raids being rather mundane 
                  camps of repetitive slaughter and looting. Air however, was 
                  different. Instead of being a distant aid to the course of events, 
                  everyone was able--or perhaps forced is a better term--to be 
                  equally invested in the event. This was no slaughter camp, but 
                  rather an adventure shared by all. This quest, this journey, 
                  lead by an insane, sadistic, floating, halfling guide took us 
                  through the looking glass into Verant's twisted version of a 
                  high altitude Disneyland. </font></span></p>

                  ever managed to reach to the lofty heights of planular conquest, 
                  but to my pleasant surprise there I was. Salladar ported us 
                  up, &quot;us&quot; being a handful of Dragonchow, the first 
                  batch of the incoming invasion force. We few stood around, slack-jawed 
                  gapping at the odd scenery. The Plane of Air seems to be a surreal, 
                  dream-like vision of eight islands, not floating in the sky, 
                  but hanging from one another by huge iron chains. You port into 
                  the lowest of the islands from which you need to proceed up 
                  this dangling chandelier. The question of course is how? The

                  Saucers ride in Disneyland-except it is shaped more like a dogs 
                  water dish. Instantly you appear on the next island up. In our 
                  case this was an island filled with wizard familiars gone bad. 
                  The little red-winged imps came at us from all directions. Valiantly 
                  we fought. Some members tragically fell off the island! At last 
                  we were down to just a handful of defenders and two imps. Salavar, 
                  the last of the tanks, fell in battle. That was when I heard 
                  the distant voice of Radalas ordering the remaining survivors 
                  to jump. That's right jump off the island. Trusting to providence, 
                  and having little choice, I jumped. What a rush. I plummeted 
                  straight down and splash landed in the East Freeport bay. The 
                  force of the fall drove me several feet under water. That was 
                  worth the price of admission right there, and we all got back

                  soon had the group reorganized, and to our relief the mobs on

                  last of the imps, each of us looting more items for the next 
                  key. Then we killed the boss mob and who do you think appears? 
                  That's right, the loony little halfling cracking jokes and begging 
                  for anyone to make a comment. He seemed surprised at our fast 
                  progress, and that we had gotten so far, and gleefully mentioned 
                  that he antisipated more fun to come. Which was my clue that 
                  he expected we would all die on the next island. Again, now 
                  that the island was devoid of any living mob, we all turned 
                  in items and got keys. </font></span></p>

                  and higher we climbed, and it was still early when we reached 
                  the fourth island. Only it was empty. No doubt the island had 
                  yet to respawn from some previous group, and without mobs, no 
                  keys could be obtained. The raid stopped there, not due to defeat, 
                  but apparently because the inhabitants of the islands had heard 
                  word of a bunch of unstoppable killers on the approach and they 
                  all left. Well that at least is the story I am sticking to. 
                  Having nothing else to do Rad gave the ok to cannonball off 
                  the island. Unlike Disneyland however, there was no 45 minute 
                  wait in roped lines for this demon drop thrill ride. You just 
                  walked to the edge and off you went screaming all the way. </font></span></p>

                  last Saturday night Sarenia and Eldeberon were invited to visit 
                  Howling Stones by Radalas, along with us came the Verds and 
                  Cabbz our old friend from Spirit Guardians. With Radalas as 
                  our guide we casually strolled our way through the dungeon gaining 
                  exp like we were 35 again, and obtaining a rare item reputed 
                  to be worth 15k. </font></span></p>
                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then 
                  Rad, exhausted from a long day, left us. Ssmacki was expected 
                  to replace Rad, but the poor monk made a wrong turn and died 
                  enroute. Then, after Verd Rezzed him, having RL issues to deal 
                  with Ssmacki reluctantly sent his regrets and we were on our 
                  own. We knew it wasn't the brightest thing to attempt to stay 
                  and fight when we were down one melee, but we were having such 
                  a good time, and we all wanted to see how we would fare on our 
                  own. All of us I believe were first time visitors to HS, (I 
                  think one of the Verds had been there but it was the first time 
                  for the other :P), but Rad had been a good guide and explained 
                  much. So we cinched up our armor and robes and fought our way 
                  back inside. </font></span></p>

                  five of us, inched our way in until we passed through the painting 
                  and dropped in on four mobs. We beat them off, and laughed at 
                  our survival. This was no longer a casual stroll, no longer 
                  a well ordered Rad lead slaughter-fest&#133;this time we had 
                  to think, and think fast.</font></span></p>
                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tensions 
                  rose as we pushed deeper, trying to remember the way. There 
                  was little room for error and we needed all our strength to 
                  survive so Sarenia and Cabbz summoned their pets, and in order 
                  to engage the lazy enchanter pet, Sarenia took on the odd roll 
                  of group puller. Strange technique I know, but one which Cabbz, 
                  Sarenia and I were well aquatinted with from our days as a trio. 
                  Verd and Verd were skeptical at first until he saw Sar's pet 
                  hitting in rapid succession for 50s. Then in an attempt to clear 
                  a hall, we pulled three. This was a handful, but not a death 
                  sentence&#133;then the four behind us repopped. Facing seven 
                  at once was down right terrifying, but that's why we had an 
                  enchanter. The team went into extreme skill mode and everyone 
                  was pulling 110 percent just to stay alive. The tide of battle 
                  was turning in our favor, with Sarenia's successful mezzing&#133;then 
                  Sar went LD. Her uncontrolled body wandered between two mobs 
                  and was killed. </font></span></p>

                  battle waged on however. Cabbz went into root/park mode keeping

                  and Verd frantically medded and healed. Three, left, two left, 
                  I only had enough mana for an evac. One left. We threw everything 
                  we had on the last one, killed it, and collapsed laughing at 
                  our success. </font></span></p>

                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                  pushed on and after several rough battles returned to the site 
                  where Rad had left us. We cleared the halls and were about to 
                  call it a night having gained over a gold in exp and unknown 
                  as yet treasure, when Verd found he couldn't open a locked door. 
                  </font></span></p>
                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
                  we had seen Rad open the door many times, but we could not. 
                  That's when Cabbz shrewdly devised a means of opening the door 
                  without a key. It worked well and the mobs came rushing out 
                  there were several, but nothing we couldn't handle, but fate 
                  had other plans and Sarenia abruptly went LD again. </font></span></p>
                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                  time two mobs attacked the cleric and quickly killed him. Sarenia

                  before casting evac. Verd was dropping fast, and so was Cabbz.

                  don't know if Verd saw the message, or if he did invite and 
                  some bug screwed it up, but as I began Evacing, with Sar still 
                  not joined, Verd died. I had hoped to at least save Cabbz who 
                  was still barely alive. The mobs closed on me, but the spell 
                  held, only when it was over I alone stood at the Zone In . Cabbz, 
                  the Verds and Sarenia were dead. </font></span></p>

                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It

                  Howling Stones Extravaganza Month enters its second week as 
                  we find our intrepid adventurers finally entering the West Wing. 
                  You may recall in our last episode, seeing that they had obtained 
                  their keys Radalas, took pity on Eldeberon and Sarenia and offered 
                  to show them Howling. He recruited a cleric and warrior in the 
                  from of two dwarves, Verd and Verd, and together with Cabbz 
                  they explored much of the North Wing. Then Rad left, and those 
                  remaining attempted to retrace their steps and were nearly all 
                  wiped out, requiring the guild to mount a major rescue effort. 
                  Since that time the two Erudian casters and the two, only mostly 
                  insane Dwarves, have befriended each other and taken it upon 
                  themselves to conquer the ancient crypt of Chrasiss.</font></span></p>

                  obsessed campaign. Scalezz was nearly left behind when she fell 
                  asleep inside the dungeon, but outside the group. Shouting at 
                  her simply didn't help. On a different occasion, Indra, who 
                  only came to help Sarenia and Eldeberon who were foolishly trying 
                  to hold the zone-in by themselves, fell through the tapestry 
                  while pulling, trapping himself inside and his only companions, 
                  the Erudians, outside. Whereupon, the two gung-ho casters rushed 
                  to his aid and were promptly killed, while Indra escaped back

                  windswept grassy plain above the canyon was empty of the usual 
                  bothersome mobs. This brought back bad memories. Earlier that 
                  day the Verds were on their way to the canyon and caught the 
                  attention of a rhino. I rooted the beast, snared it, then since 
                  it broke the root quickly I simply jumped off the cliff, and 
                  began to levitate down pleased with my genius at avoiding the 
                  animal. I could just imagine the rhino's disappointment as it 
                  stood helpless upon the precipice watching me casually descend 
                  into the canyon-WHAP! Something hit me. I looked around and 
                  saw nothing. It hit me again. I pointed my nose down and flew 
                  to the bottom of the canyon, and there to my disbelief was the 
                  rhino. Whap! Whap! Whap! I was killed. Hearing about my death 
                  Verdarillian the cleric, coming to my rescue, forgot to get 
                  levitated and fell to his own death. (He was not the first cleric 
                  to do so that day as it turned out.)</font></span></p>

                  rhinos can!&quot;</font></span></p>

                  We all entered Howling Stones and discovered, to our shock, 
                  other people there. A high level group from the Black Sun guild 
                  was in North Wing ahead of us, but after speaking to them, I 
                  obtained their permission to play through. Despite their higher 
                  levels, they were unsure about zone. In return for first access 
                  to the West Wing Key Room (WWKR), we lent support and information 
                  to Black Sun, and even teamed up for a &quot;mini raid&quot; 
                  on the WWKR. Once it was cleared out we showed Black Sun where 
                  to obtain their own key to the WWKR. Then we slipped inside 
                  the WWKR, leaving Black Sun to farm everything else. </font></span></p>

                  &quot;Ya think it's such a good idea to camp inside the room?&quot; 
                  Sarenia asked hesitantly. <br>
                  &quot;Sure why not?&quot; Verd replied. <br>
                  The spawns, that we had killed together with Black Sun twenty 
                  minutes before, repoped in fast succession. Alone this time 
                  and trapped inside the locked room the ensuing battle was fierce. 
                  <br>
                  &quot;Evac?&quot; Nanadawen looked at me pensively as the mobs 
                  began to mount. <br>
                  &quot;Hold on,&quot; I replied counting. Three Prye Golems, 
                  two bile, three, no, four skeletons. &quot;Mana?&quot;<br>
                  &quot;I'm still full!&quot; Sarenia replied. <br>
                  &quot;Cleric?&quot; I called.<br>
                  &quot;60&quot;, Verdarillian said. </font></span></p>

                  With Verd covered in splattering golem goo, Seung slowing, and 
                  Sar mezzing, Nanadawen and I began to blast away. And soon the 
                  room began to empty. Hoots of stunned success went up among 
                  the group. </font></span></p>
                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                  &quot;We are one kick butt group man!&quot; Nanadawen shouted, 
                  as the smoke began to clear and revealed a stack of mob bodies. 
                  </font></span></p>
                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                  I looked at the pile then back at my mana and was bewildered 
                  that it was still 50 percent! Then I realized our entire party 
                  had received Candywen's KEIs buff just prior to leaving the 
                  SG raid. We were overflowing with mana. If we hadn't had KEIs 
                  the battle might not have been won. </font></span></p>
                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                  cleared the room six times before the Crypt Keeper spawned and 
                  we got the key to the West Wing. Then we informed Black Sun 
                  the room was there's and that the spawns were nicely broken 
                  up and the first would spawn in exactly five minutes. We then 
                  returned to the Zone-In where to our surprise we found HS was 
                  filled with people. There was an unheard of twenty people in 
                  the zone! Luckily none were in the West Wing. </font></span></p>
                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                  looked at the door to the West Wing. None of us had been there. 
                  None of us had even heard rumor of what was beyond the door. 
                  None of us had a map. It was now nearly midnight EST on a Sunday 
                  and most of the DC masters who had HS keys had logged for the 
                  night. Rad, Sunu, Swifty, Teroth, Indra, they were all gone. 
                  There would be no help for the rest of the night. We were on 
                  our own. </font></span></p>
                <p> <span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Bah!&quot; 
                  Verd retorted to Sarenia's hesitation to enter. &quot;You must 
                  have confidence girl!&quot;<br>
                  &quot;Verd's right!&quot; I said, and saw the little dwarf puff 
                  up in his armor. &quot;Nanadawen let's show our support for 
                  Verd's skill by not even memming or evac spells. We won't be 
                  needing them!&quot;<br>
                  Verd blinked. &quot;Ah, well, thanks guys, but...&quot;<br>
                  &quot;Just kidding Verd.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  We entered carefully. Initially the West Wing was much like 
                  the North Wing. We cleared the room, but before proceeding further 
                  I summoned my conjured wizard's eye and sent it ahead to scout. 
                  I counted the mobs, searched the rooms and traveled ahead down 
                  the halls, zig-zaging as I searched for traps. I approached 
                  a small rug and a moment later my eye plummeted. It fell into 
                  a terribly deep pit filled with several nasty mobs and sharp 
                  rocks.</font></span></p>

                  We pushed on through the tapestry and committed ourselves. Not 
                  since I was in single digits with my first character--when I 
                  still thought you had to pay for passage on the ship out of 
                  Freeport, and that the bandits in Gfay were a group of high 
                  level players afk at their &quot;camp&quot; which was complete 
                  with tents--was I so totally immersed in the game. Any mistake, 
                  any accident could cause a disaster of incredible proportions 
                  and everything ahead was a mystery. You could hear the breathing 
                  of the golems ahead, smell the dust and decay of a century of 
                  Iksar abandonment. The torches pots flickered, the shadows danced 
                  fearfully, and the world of Norrath was again a living breathing&#133;dangerous 
                  place. </font></span></p>

                  in his path; pausing now and again for me to send in my eye. 
                  We carefully cleared our way. Then in a moment of sheer cruelty 
                  on Verdarillian's part, he let Verd die. I can only speculate 
                  at their childhood. How they must have prematurely grayed their 
                  mother's beard. </font></span></p>
                <p class="Normal"><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Verd 
                  dropped dead. With no melee and at least three mobs to deal 
                  with I cast evac. We popped up at the zone-in, minus Verd of 
                  course. Now what? Fighting back in without Verd would be problematic 
                  at best. </font></span></p>

                  &quot;Consent me.&quot; The voice was strange and nearby. A 
                  dark elf dressed all in white stood in the shadows of the zone-in. 
                  No sooner had Verd consented when the stranger vanished into 
                  the West Wing door. In less than a heartbeat it seemed, she 
                  returned with Verd's body in tow, and dropping it ran off. </font></span></p>

                  &quot;Wait!&quot; Sarenia cried. &quot;We want to repay you!&quot;<br>
                  &quot;No need,&quot; she replied.<br>
                  &quot;But&#133;how on earth did you do that? Why didn't the 
                  mobs argo you? How did you drop down beyond the tapestry and 
                  then get back out? I don't understand.&quot;<br>

                  took this as a sign we should stop for the night. I gathered

                  where I froze my body with the keys on it. So stay tuned for 
                  the next exciting episode of the Howling Stone Adventurers.

                  necromancer. They each wore grim faces, as they spoke softly 
                  to one another. Down the slope a few yards behind them the battle 
                  encampment waited. Triangle banners flying the Dragonchow standards 
                  snapped in the brisk, ever present wind. Guild warriors sharpened 
                  their blades, clerics tended the wounded, and casters meditated. 
                  The next battle would be a defining moment for the war band-nearly 
                  30 people, comprising five raiding parties, had fought their 
                  way to the 4th island of the Plane of Air. It had been a long

                  The Plane of Air. As much a logistics nightmare as a challenging 
                  battle. This last weekend the guild launch what could be the 
                  most ambitious raid thus far. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Air 
                  consists of eight main islands hanging in the sky. The first 
                  can only be reached via a wizard spell. This spell requires 
                  a component that costs 100pp. So 100pp will get six people up. 
                  After that to get to the next island everyone in the party must 
                  obtain a key. Each island is this way, all requiring individual 
                  keys. These keys will vanish the moment you leave Air. You cannot 
                  bind in Air. You cannot port, punt or gate while in Air. You 
                  cannot levitate in Air. And you cannot CoH in air (summon a 
                  party member). This being said, our goal of killing the main 
                  mob on island seven meant we had to do many tricky things in 
                  addition to simply killing tough mobs, and there was one other 
                  hitch. No one can talk. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
                  the second island there are hordes of killer imps that attack 
                  on sight. Once all are killed, you loot items off them then 
                  kill the main mob. This spawns Sirian the Lunitic, you turn 
                  in the items to him and he gives you keys. He speaks to you 
                  as you do it and he has bracketed words in his message. However, 
                  if you speak a single word in say--even if you hail him, he 
                  will kill everyone in your party. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DC 
                  had five full groups attending this raid. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
                  the first problem was that there weren't enough keys to go around. 
                  Each mob dropped several key items, but there simply were not 
                  enough mobs to supply the raid with keys for everyone. (Note: 
                  mobs don't respawn in air for several hours). The solution was 
                  a grisly one. Those raid members left without keys needed to 
                  kill themselves. For while Summon Party member doesn't work 
                  in Air, Summon Corpse does. Dueling will argo Sirian so that 
                  wasn't possible, instead &quot;suicide rods&quot; were conjured 
                  by mages. These rods steal health in return for mana. Steal 
                  too much and you die. So those without keys used the rods to 
                  kill themselves--the rods tasted oddly like Kool-Aid. Once dead, 
                  each member &quot;froze&quot; their body (meaning you loot everything, 
                  but don't hit &quot;done&quot; or &quot;esc&quot; and let the 
                  loot window time out. This preserves your body and makes it 
                  so it can be rezzed over and over. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
                  this point our friendly neighborhood necro, Teroth, who was 
                  in a group with Eldeberon, used his key to go up, then I would 
                  invite the &quot;dead people&quot; and he would summon the body, 
                  then a cleric would rez them on the next island beside the necro. 
                  In this way we moved everyone up. For late comers--or for those 
                  who fell out of the plane--I had to jump off the islands with 
                  a cleric, (you fall and land in the East Freeport Bay), group 
                  with them, port them to the first island, have them kill themselves, 
                  have the cleric rez them, then summon the body to the proper 
                  island, then rez them again. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Starting 
                  to see the complex nature of this? Some of you know the frustrations 
                  associated with simply organizing a single group, imagine doing 
                  this with 30 restless people. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                  pushed to the 4th island but by then it was late and people 
                  were tired. So many camped in the island but some had to leave 
                  (like Sarenia and I who needed to dump loot to mules on behalf 
                  of the raid). Of course all the keys would go poof. So Teroth 
                  committed suicide and left his keys on his body to preserve 
                  them for the next day. So at the start of the next day I ported 
                  Teroth up, and he summoned his body, got the keys, went invis, 
                  slipped up to the 4th island and began summoning everyone else. 
                  </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
                  to give you an idea of the mobs we faced. The boss mob on the 
                  4th island, besides being able to dish out and take lots of 
                  damage, and being able to summon people to him, delivers a Death 
                  Touch every 30 seconds. At the start of these battles, Rad would 
                  ask for a volunteer to take the first Death Touch. Sarenia bravely 
                  volunteered for the first one, and Ispritu for two others. So 
                  the effort here was to kill him faster then he could kill all 
                  the tanks, which wasn't all that long. In fact, the massive 
                  volunteering for the final Death Touch battle of the raid was 
                  impressive to witness, as raid members pushed forward to offer 
                  their lives.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each 
                  island got progressively harder, and as I don't believe anyone, 
                  except perhaps Teroth, had ever penetrated further than island 
                  four, island five became a formidable challenge. Rad tried a 
                  pull and most of the raid was wiped, (which, it turns out, is 
                  not unusual for island five). Before dying however, the raid 
                  managed to kill one of the intended &quot;break-island&quot; 
                  mobs, allowing the subsequent pulls to be made far more safely. 
                  In the end we managed to clear island 5, but it was too late, 
                  for by then it was deep into Sunday evening, our time had run 
                  out, and Rad called the raid. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Time 
                  it seemed was our greatest adversary in Air. Nevertheless, Dragonchow 
                  pushed and cleared two islands further than ever before. Many 
                  lore drops were looted, too many even be sorted out at the end 
                  of the raid. Our guild Loremaster Klothe and Librarian, Teroth, 
                  are still busy, locked away in the guild hall's basement researching, 
                  tagging and classifying the various items obtained into spreadsheets 
                  for later distribution.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  Air Raid was a grand adventure, a nightmare to administrate, 
                  and a challenge not wholly won. Three more islands remain above 
                  us unconqured. Perhaps one day we will return and place the 
                  DC coat-of-arms upon the blood soaked fields of the Peak. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                  special thanks to the raid leaders, Radalas, Teroth Klothe, 
                  and Swifty, for organizing this ambitious adventure. Dragonchow 
                  is very proud and fortunate to have such dedicated and gifted 
                  leaders. </font></p>

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  first day began gloriously hot but there was a nasty taint of 
                  water in the air. I was waiting for a burrow patcher who never 
                  showed and the time of my mission was growing near. First I 
                  went to scout ahead and gain a token that would allow me into 
                  their realm. I waited until they had begun the process and it 
                  had been going on for an hour, hoping that they would not notice 
                  me slipping into their midst. Dazed and confused, and thirsty 
                  and worn I figured they should then be. SoW would be unnecessary 
                  as the Hynes Nexus was close to me, so after hailing the wall 
                  of Tube tokens and feeding silver into it to get my Shard of 
                  the T, I was granted access to a port pad. The Tube Energized 
                  and I found myself half a zone away from the gates so I proceeded 
                  to make my way to them on foot. No guards greeted me but instead 
                  SoE clockworks that handed me a small bag containing some scrolls. 
                  The bag itself was emblazoned with the sigil of the Bards of 
                  Altec Lansing, how gnomes could be bards I was unsure but since 
                  they are small and can be of sharp tooth when questioned I did 
                  not pursue this matter (their wares though are of the finest). 
                  The First scroll displayed a mystic box of non-purple ness. 
                  I had to phaugh at this because while the folks at the Arcane 
                  Academy of Sohnee have continued to turn out decent boxes, I 
                  remember the regal Mauve and Purple ones and this one was Dusky 
                  Gray and with only vaguely purplish hints. Another scroll described 
                  the wares of the Merchants of the Station a thing they called 
                  Phat Lewt. General merchants they were selling cups and clothing. 
                  There was also a flyer describing a general lottery but after 
                  having had to trade in 97 sets of Orc Pawn Picks (388 in total) 
                  to Toshan Hallard to get a winning lottery ticket for the High 
                  Keep Lottery I refrained from pursuing this. Another scroll 
                  told of some barbarian Book Binders known as White Wolf who 
                  were reportedly trying to capture the essence of Norrath. They 
                  included a curiously cut (20 sided) low quality gem with numbers 
                  on it that I felt the marred its beauty although it did recall 
                  to me the times of youth when yea verily there was an odd pre 
                  occupation with such things. I did not stop to explain to them 
                  that Norrath was Female and an Egg Layer and that as brood lings 
                  we were trained that trying to capture their essence is a futile 
                  and frustrating quest as it is easier and more beneficial to 
                  briefly capture their attention. No, they were not part of my 
                  mission so I quietly made my way and stood in a line of pasty 
                  elves wearing silver stud earrings. A line of furry halflings 
                  and stout dwarves. A line of Ogres and Trolls with the occasional 
                  Wood Elf and Half Elf nymph among the lot. To the front I made 
                  my way and told them the appropriate [key words] and they handed 
                  me over another bag with a badge of recognition and bits of 
                  paper with words in the pink skinned tongue. Return at 6 the 
                  keeper said and I nodded to signify my agreement though I knew 
                  I would come back at 8 when the gathering was really going to 
                  happen.</font></p>

                  as Soulsek Ro had seized the day and refused to yield. I checked 
                  my inventory for my badge and then I checked to make sure I

                  had left my Bank Key at my campsite so I was forced to trudge 
                  back. I retrieved it and some plat and waited again on the mystic 
                  tube which delivered me early to the Arlington Pad. Seeing that 
                  I had time I took the opportunity to retire to a local alehouse 
                  to fortify myself for the break in. To my dismay I discovered 
                  that The Parish&#146;s Caf&eacute; a fine place though it is 
                  was not serving their mean Rat Meat Sammichs during the hot 
                  season so I was forced to order a Tizmak Steak with Alchemically 
                  Flavored Smashed Roots. The meal was unsatisfying but the accompanying 
                  Rolling Rodents from the Dwarves of Old Latrobe had put me into 
                  a proper frame of mind so off to the enemy encampment I went.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Arriving 
                  again at the gates of the FoE I saw a greater number of the 
                  pink skins than during my early afternoon foray and tried to 
                  blend into the crowd. It reminded me of the old days of NFP 
                  or even the current Bazaar and indeed the lag was high. Climbing 
                  the left staircase and flowing forward as the crowd permitted 
                  I made my way into the Hall of the Gathering. It was in this 
                  hall amongst the fleshies, My Lord Cazic (Hssah hssah) had said 
                  that I might find comrades and fellow travelers of the Saryrn 
                  who might aid me in my quest. Trapped among the soft skin horde, 
                  but knowing my task would not be easy, I resisted the urge to 
                  camp to my bard and start singing Cinda&#146;s Charismatic or 
                  even Shauri&#146;s Sonorous for across the way I spotted a sign 
                  that read SARYRN. Three folk were there and as I approached 
                  we all hit our Hail keys and went through ritual greetings and 
                  such. When we all turned to examine the table beneath our flag 
                  we noted that indeed it was round but seemed sized only for 
                  gnomes or mebbe even fairies. 2 more Saryrnians spawned and 
                  poof we were out of chairs. This shall not be I thought and 
                  quickly scanning the terrain behind us spotted a huge table 
                  of Seventh Hammer people with 4 unused chairs. Using the skills 
                  taught me by a fellow Roguish guild mate I snagged 3 of them 
                  remembering his saying &#145;Always leave&#146;em something 
                  so they think they still have it all&#146;. When I had turned 
                  back even more Saryrnians had popped so it was mutually agreed 
                  upon that if they weren&#146;t gonna provide us with a big enough 
                  table we would gather up enough chairs and mark off our space. 
                  Off to an overhead balcony I went where I saw numerous chair 
                  ground spawns from which I quickly I rounded up four. As I turned 
                  to walk back down two non Saryrnians also out on a chair gathering 
                  mission saw that I had 4 and asked &#147;Are you really gonna 
                  take all those at once?&#148; and I replied &#147;Why yes of 
                  course&#148;. Those silly buggers I thought, why did they limited 
                  themselves to only 2 a piece were they unaware that chairs stacked?!?!? 
                  I returned to camp with my stack of 4 a few others returned 
                  with 2 a piece and one fellow of a like mind as me returned 
                  with 5 so we had about 20 &#150; 30 chairs which would turn 
                  out to be not enough.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No 
                  sooner then had this first wave of Sarynians all hit /sit and 
                  /join&#146;d the chat channel when a Wood Elfish but more Halflingish 
                  Woman stood in front of the mike and broadcasted &#147;Hi My 
                  Name is Sindhee Bowenz and I&#146;d like to welcome you all 
                  to the Boston Fan Faire on behalf of Sohnee and all of our Sponsors. 
                  Hope you have a good time and we&#146;ll see you all tomorrow.&#148; 
                  She promptly gated leaving us wondering, but we were all used 
                  to cryptic broadcasts so this was nothing new. Well we chatted 
                  awhile talking about hunting spots and classes and guilds and 
                  people and weapons and spells and such when all of a sudden 
                  a Saryrn Guide popped named Cedryl. We all looked around wondering 
                  who had petitioned, but it seemed that he was coming over to 
                  proudly announce that We seemed to have the most folks registered 
                  at FanFaire 43 or so (woo hoo to us). He seemed like a nice 
                  enough fellow, but unfortunately, as was typical for a guide, 
                  he was being told nothing more by VI then we were. He depopped 
                  for a while and we discussed this new information and tried 
                  to figure out who was coming. Well no sooner had we mentioned 
                  one Guilds name when 6 of them popped. Their leader inquired 
                  who all was here so we showed him our name tags, which for some 
                  technical reason, weren&#146;t floating above our heads but 
                  on plaques on our chests. Well he took mine and uttered, &#147;I 
                  don&#146;t know you.&#148; and promptly turned his back. Whether 
                  he meant this to be insulting or not it took all I could to 
                  hold in my laughter until they had moved on so I could turn 
                  back to my neighbor with whom I was chatting to utter &#147;Its 
                  so nice to see that they behave in RL like they do in game.&#148; 
                  He as well got a chuckle from this. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seeming 
                  like an opportune time to fetch some libation, and after having 
                  asked the folks there and getting no for a reply I approached 
                  a vendor and got myself a Halas Heater for 5 plat 5 gold. When 
                  I turned back around I saw my fellows had promptly camped a 
                  large table that had had become free so I returned and continued 
                  conversing. It grew late (well early for an EQ night) but I 
                  decided that it was time to gate back to my bind point as most 
                  of the table had retired. Before I gated I thought it might 
                  be prudent to retrieve the Chest Slot piece from the in RPGware 
                  Tailor so proceeded to that table. After retrieving it I briefly 
                  got into a trade skill discussion a retired Navy man whose son 
                  in the Army had got him into the game got passed up in level 
                  by the father and promptly quit. On my way to zone out I also 
                  said nighters to two other Saryrnians who were questing for 
                  Allakhazam&#146;s Gathering Site. I bid them adieu, gated then 
                  camped out.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                  I arose early again the following day and once again camped 
                  my bind point waiting for the burrow patcher. While I camped 
                  this spawn I used the time to respond to a question about Pulling/Tanking 
                  from a Guild Wizard attempting to learn how to play a melee 
                  class as well as continuing my struggle with XML and the New 
                  UI. Five hours passed and the burrow patcher again did not pop 
                  (though he did promise to do so on the first day of the coming 
                  week) so I headed off to the camp of the enemy. Again Soulsek 
                  Ro was in ascendance on the field and giving Karana some seriously 
                  angry looks. While not as irritatingly wet as the day before 
                  it was definitely not basking weather.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  Second Day began again in the Gathering Hall but was a tad more 
                  difficult in that they had set up the seats in rows. I wandered 
                  around scanning for my comrades once again cursing a Shaman&#146;s 
                  the lack of tracking and still having urges to camp to my Bard. 
                  I discovered them, wandered over and went thru the pink skin 
                  ritual greetings. Shortly there after the Halfling Woman Bowenz 
                  spawned again on the podium area to review the coming day. She 
                  began with an announcement filled with grave tidings. It seemed 
                  that sometime during the night a few evil folks had made off 
                  with the Mystic Tapestry of the Gathering that had all the Sponsor 
                  Names on it and that it was wanted back. She told us that they 
                  would not take any action if it was returned but that if they 
                  had to review the Surveillance Tapes then the folks responsible 
                  would be Banned. She ended this plea with the statement &#147;Don&#146;t 
                  make me use my Mother Voice.&#148; but as she said this I got 
                  the impression that she really did want to use that voice and 
                  go around spanking bottoms and perhaps chasing them around a 
                  room while wearing black leathers. Yep not a Druid as I thought 
                  but a Halfling Rogue. She then proceeded to introduce some folks 
                  who were there, Allakhazam, Baelish from Castersrealm, a representative 
                  from Druids Grove and EQShaman and of course Woody Hearn who 
                  does indeed look like that brown haired backward wearing cap 
                  person he draws just a smidge shorter (based upon the drawing 
                  perspective) with bushier hair (another dang hobbit). She prefaced 
                  his introduction with &#147;and of course Woody Hearn who I 
                  have an agreement with about drawing my image&#148; which I 
                  won&#146;t speculate any further about. Some GM&#146;s were 
                  introduced, some dev people were introduced, and of course the 
                  person in charge of the Computer Room came in to announce that 
                  they were having problems with the local servers and that they 
                  had to take them down &#145;So please camp out Now&#146;.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
                  these announcements they began the Live Quest which consisted 
                  of folks breaking down into groups of 10 &#150; 16 with 1 Group 
                  Leader who could talk to the NPC&#146;s. The NPC&#146;s gave 
                  out puzzles to perform or paper to pass to another NPC to get 
                  another item to pass to another etc or Plat Pieces to use to 
                  buy items from other NPC&#146;s etc. Well I decided to take 
                  the role of scout for my party so camped down to my bard mind 
                  set (whew SELO&#148;&#148;&#148;&#148;&#148;&#148;S you think 
                  lack of clarity is a withdrawal) unfortunately this was RL.

                  sure he starts going npc to npc to npc. I did help him with 
                  one quest during this cycling which I must confess was tainted 
                  by the fact that the League of Antonican Bards did have me on 
                  the Grobb to FP Route. Seems one of the NPC&#146;s was selling 
                  Poop and needed a New Slogan so I came up with &#147;Buy a Scoop, 
                  of My Poop, Roses dead, Makes them Red.&#148; Bad scansion, 
                  unsubtle but its what they understand in Grobb. Of course I 
                  was also distracted a few times in particular by the blonde 
                  in the white tank top who was proportionally close to the 989 
                  Artwork who was leaning over a table in the Main lobby helping 
                  to solve one of the word puzzle (SPLASH). Or when I stopped 
                  briefly to chat to the fellow in the Kilt who was a Dev Team 
                  Artist to discover if he knew much about the new UI and the 
                  XML coding and he invoked the name Scott Hartsman much as one 
                  might say Cthulu, but I was dragged away by the group leader 
                  when I was about to ask about the orange splash effect on a 
                  spell and other graphic issues. We had disaster strike on about 
                  245pm when our group leader discovered he had dropped our quest 
                  bag some where and when he confirmed it about 315ish I was disappointed 
                  in that I had finally tracked down Barik who was the NPC we 
                  needed to let poor Gravloss in from the outside (those evil 
                  SoE folks had him dressed in a Kilt and Wool standing on a Boston 
                  Street in 98 degree weather with the full power of Soulsek glaring 
                  down on him). Barik needless to say was in the Prexus cooled 
                  Gathering Hall. I could also tell you of poor Linaple who was 
                  on the right front staircase and began the shift as a mousy 
                  brown straight haired girl but ended the shift as a curly black 
                  haired one by the left staircase. Or poor Glasnurple who they 
                  made don a Vah Shir Nose and Head piece in the hot mezzanine 
                  Air. I could also tell you of the evil Mitrono who took far 
                  too much relish in playing an SoE programmed NPC right up to 
                  not answering Hails unless you used his name to simulate that 
                  he was in your target box. Most of all I remember the Road Warrior 
                  the man called Max&#133; (whack whack whack whack whack whack

                  I had to let him that lurks come forward and listened as he 
                  asked the Bell Captain &#145;Pardon but where is the White Hill 
                  Room&#146; &#145;4th Floor&#146; &#145;Ah that explains why 
                  I couldn&#146;t find it. Thank You.&#146; Hssah, hssah, By Cazic&#146;s 
                  power I banish thee. My puissant Lord once again banished the 
                  evil thing that lurks back deep in my soul.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                  rode a gnomish lifting contraption up to the 4th floor and walked 
                  into a narrow room with just 5 people. I greeted them and asked 
                  if there were any Acrylia drops up here or Yew leafs for that 
                  matter. I would have continued but the Gnomish Woman from FV 
                  asked me what manner of crafter I was. I Tailor and Smith and 
                  Potter and Baker and well basically everything but Gem Craft 
                  and I haven&#146;t Tinkered in Ages. I talked and burbled with 
                  her for the brief time we waited while Yakizima showed up and 
                  I could tell that her eyes gleamed with the same madness as 
                  mine. I have listened to monks talk on and on about ratio this 
                  and ratio that and weight factor and how stylish it looks. I 
                  have watch Mobs run gibbering in madness as versus interrupting 
                  them and I have petitioned GM&#146;s to see when the Monk Chat 
                  Filter was expected to go live. If there had been people who 
                  did not share some of the madness I am sure they too would have 
                  run screaming from the room. While we awaited his appearance 
                  the Gnome offered me a Ginger treat which I politely declined 
                  and we somehow got onto the subject of Cannoli&#146;s, she said 
                  she preferred the ones from Katherine&#146;s while I felt that 
                  the ones from Mike&#146;s were better we also discussed the 
                  ones from Modern and then got distracted by another persons 
                  comment on a trade skill while the room filled up some around 
                  us. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then 
                  he arrived. I had read that he was a tuff spawn to get to and 
                  I had expected at least 5 SoE clockworks to separate him from 
                  the actual crafts people. I had read that trade skills were 
                  only a small part of his job description and that they were 
                  useful only to SoE in the terms of slowing the people down. 
                  An after thought. And yet here he came. Granted we were on the 
                  4th floor but perhaps it wasn&#146;t that they thought that 
                  little of trade skills but more a matter of keeping the real 
                  mental patients away from the only slightly insane ones.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
                  looked and seemed not unlike the Monk from this /GU ( gucomics.keenspace.com/d/20010120.html 
                  ) and acted something like a cross between a desert madman and 
                  Tykar Renlin in EFP, I was unsure whether he thought the turnout 
                  for him was a Mirage and would be asking for &#145;Another Cup 
                  of Coffee&#146; or if I should be giving him 4 bottles of Drom&#146;s 
                  Champagne and a blanket. He was bearded mustached and thin man 
                  with a tattoo on his left arm who appeared worn out. He wasn&#146;t 
                  like a Deer in Head Lights at night but more like one that had 
                  wandered into LL Bean right as Deer Hunting Season opened to 
                  snack on the bale of hay in their display. Did he not sense 
                  the danger? Or did he have a hidden Taser or Thorazine dart 
                  gun on him perhaps? Was this perhaps a trap?</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Items 
                  of note that were discussed in the session began with a shout 
                  from a woman in the back about the noodle recipes not in yet 
                  and the dire need of making pasta for her guildies. It&#146;s 
                  on the test he replied it should be live soon. Issues of Karana 
                  vs. Tunare Cultural Fletching were raised and he replied it 
                  was going to be looked into but that Rich Waters had done the 
                  original work not him. Jagged Pine Recipes and their non-working 
                  ness were done by the zone designer and were going to be looked 
                  at. Skill Ups /Advancement we were told was a modifier that 
                  was adjustable skill to skill with pottery being the easiest 
                  and fishing the hardest. There was mention made of the Pottery 
                  Skill up curve being smoothed (like was done with smithing) 
                  with recipes between Poison Vials and Spirit stones but that 
                  its advancement modifier was going to be increased (made harder). 
                  Rogue Poison stacking was discussed but it was not feasible 
                  with the current coding. Poison was going to be changed to a 
                  DoT effect vs. Immediate DD to lower agro but that to make a 
                  dose stackable and individually applicable would require them 
                  being written as unique spells? There was mention of looking 
                  into a Multi Charge Device that could summon one vial of poison 
                  but nothing definite. Cultural Chain Armors were discussed as 
                  being noted for adding into the game (some were missing imbues 
                  or tempers) and various cultural armors were discussed for looking 
                  at stat modifications but that the sheer number made it a difficult 
                  prospect (Barbarian Chain and Dark Elf chain were going to be 
                  looked at). Ore Conversions were to be looked at as soon as 
                  they figured out why rusty weapons weren&#146;t recycling in 
                  the proper ratios. As far as the original conversion ratios 
                  Rich Waters name again was referenced. The possibility of recycling 
                  high-end gems from jewelry at the cost of the metal was discussed 
                  by possibly adding a gem cutter into a jeweler&#146;s kit. Black 
                  Sapphires, Diamond and Blue Diamonds were discussed as possibly 
                  being coded Magic so to cease the current pick pocketing of 
                  them by certain rogues and the gem cost inflation. On an off 
                  topic there was a brief discussion of Bard made instruments 
                  (whack whack whack whack gurgle&#133;) Master Enright wanted 
                  to make it a new skill but as it was one of the things I wanted 
                  to discuss / ask about so will save my questions for Email to 
                  him. Mass Recipe Conversions were discussed, but the current 
                  coding does not seem to support it. There was an old old code 
                  change that permitted fletchers to drop 20 heads, shafts, fletches 
                  and nocks into a bag and succeed or fail on the entire lot, 
                  but shrug. Yew Leafs were again going to be looked at as far 
                  as ground spawns and the related problems but Yak mentioned 
                  that they had been put on some critters in the zone? Nearby 
                  zones? The Velious trivials were also being looked at for being 
                  lowered. The Terror Tarantula was going to be treated like Ling 
                  Ling to see if she would drop a horde of baby tarantulas in 
                  Toxx or elsewhere to make Erudite Cultural Tailoring actually 
                  possible. Tailoring of Robes and other caster items was also 
                  said to be on his list. There was a discussion of Agnostic Cultural 
                  Armor but it lead into a discussion of what made a culture and 
                  how it was linked and other then being theoretical if you are 
                  a half elf or agnostic don&#146;t hold your breath even with 
                  an EB item. The possibility of adding tinkered items was discussed 
                  and while a Breeze Mask was briefly talked about his eyes nearly 
                  glowed as he noted down the suggestion of a Gnomish Coin Compactor 
                  not unlike the Tiny Purse from Yelinak. On the Alchemy side 
                  he did mention that new potions without the negatives were being 
                  looked at and that they would look at the buy back prices and 
                  base herb costs to make it a more viable skill. While multi 
                  charge regular Invisibility Potions are a possibility this has 
                  been shot down by the Powers that Be. Sadly questions of him 
                  to ask I did not, but I did manage to snag a Lore No Drop card 
                  of Enright so that serious questions I can send (whether he 
                  reads them and replies /shrug).</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enlightening

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  Hartsman. The person the man in the kilt said would know of 
                  the UI and the XML. A man that cried madness at the heart of

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                  descended again in the gnomish lifting device this time accompanied 
                  by a Cleric/Mage who also had questions for the Hartsman. He 
                  was Linux coder and was curious why they hadn&#146;t ported 
                  it over and wanted to ask this and other more technical questions. 
                  He moved along slowly as he too had been an out runner during 
                  the Live Quest and was still suffering from the effects of the 
                  dreaded Blister DoT. We arrived on the Mezzanine and I briefly 
                  checked the location of the Room but the bard in me was unconscious 
                  or at least well gagged. Again I let him that Lurks out. &#145;Pardon 
                  but where might the Terrace Room be?&#146; &#145;Under the Lobby.&#146; 
                  &#145;Thanks.&#146; HSSAH hssah, back down back down begone. 
                  My compatriot never noticed this internal byplay and started 
                  to cross back to the elevators, but I said no this way it&#146;s 
                  faster and took stairs not 10 steps from us. He was amazed by 
                  my knowledge, but I informed him that I could have pulled this 
                  zone in the Live Quest as I knew where all the mobs were, he 
                  asked me where was I earlier and I just shrugged.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  Terrace Room reminded me a bit of Vox&#146;s Lair and a little 
                  of the Wurm caves in GD. It was large and indeed there were 
                  at least 80 folks in zone ready to assault the Hartsman when 
                  he popped. Myself I was there to quest with him so tried to 
                  make my way to the front. My compatriot grabbed a seat in the 
                  second row and discovering no seats further I joined him and 
                  made sure we had one extra. I was unaware of it but I am an 
                  instinctual planner and before the Hartsman popped my compatriots 
                  GF showed up so the seat became hers. Like all mobs he popped 
                  a random time later then expected and he did spawn with the 
                  Barker and Carrico and Albert.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                  Let me tell you of these pops. The Hartsman looks not unlike 
                  a new model gnome but human sized. He stated he played an L 
                  59 Wizzie and Chanter and that one of them was Erudite. If you 
                  really wish a RL reference think of the character Bulldog on 
                  Frazier but taller. Come to think of it his humor was not unlike 
                  Bulldogs but more later. The Barker spawn was sporting a Matthew 
                  Perry ish look and stated he played a Half Elf Druid. I was 
                  curious what his other half was but came later to suspect it 
                  was not Human but Dark Elf. Carrico and Albert I came to think 
                  of as a pair of Coldain Paladins named Surly and Silent as the 
                  one question that Carrico fielded was to emphatically state 
                  that NO there would NOT be anymore Coldain Shawl Quests the 
                  last one was Blessed by a God fer crying out loud. The Albert 
                  of course was silent through out this session. While they might 
                  have had cause for their demeanor from having to debug the 8th, 
                  9th and 10th ring quests recently, it did reduce their Assist 
                  Radius. Which still left the room to face the Hartsman and Barker 
                  mobs. Or should that have been reversed?</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                  The Hartsman and the Barker were unphased. They had survived 
                  the first session and began this one running. Hartsman opened 
                  up the floor immediately and asked who had a question. One fellow 
                  3 rows back in the dead center made Arnold Horshak noises to 
                  which Hartsman stared at him and said you sir and pointed to 
                  someone in the back right area (he did come back to him eventually). 
                  The two fielded questions as if they were part of a duo doing 
                  a &#145;Who&#146;s on first&#146; routine. When a necromancer 
                  began I know that you folks hate necro&#146;s Hartsman replied 
                  &#147;We don&#146;t hate you&#148;, turned away and said next 
                  question before immediately turning back to answering the necro. 
                  They were glib, they were humorous they were entertaining and 
                  even at some points informative. Heck for the first hour they 
                  seemed to even be having fun playing hot potatoe (Quayle enterprises) 
                  with the mike as coding was fielded by Hartsman who quickly 
                  handed it off to Barker if it was Vision&#153;.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, 
                  they were aware of the AE bug in Vex Thal in which you would 
                  resist blindness but still get hit by stun and knockback. They 
                  were trying to track it down but based upon how AE worked if 
                  they fixed it Bards wouldn&#146;t work. No they wouldn&#146;t 
                  post the bug lists as they take care of 150 plus a week. Dire 
                  Charm is capped at 45 (or was it 46) the Barker stated that 
                  it was too powerful a spell raise the charmable critter level, 
                  as it was a permanent charm. They did acknowledge though that 
                  there were few zones currently other then Kael where this was 
                  useful. Drops on Kunarkian high level spells had been increased. 
                  Certain Luclin spells should be considered of the Ancient / 
                  Rare category rather then as standard spell book components. 
                  The new PoP Key code had been downloaded and would soon be accessible 
                  to eliminate the key ring problem. In the new system you will 
                  have a screen which shows which areas you have earned the keys 
                  for without having to devote a slot to them. The Bazaar item 
                  count was currently capped at 30 items as this is the limit 
                  available to them for NPC Merchants. Yes merchants have more 
                  items, but there was just not space available in the coding 
                  to allow for changes to the bag / container code without totally 
                  re writing it and if they did it then Bards wouldn&#146;t be 
                  working. In regards to the Odus / GD portal Hartsman replied 
                  &#147;Ah you mean the Toxx Port Lotto? Well my Erudite gets 
                  lonely he likes having visitors every now and then.&#148; But 
                  yes the Spires were supposed to /say the time till port and 
                  they were looking into it but well don&#146;t blame them if 
                  Bards wouldn&#146;t be working. When will a Lightning Bolt look 
                  like a Lightning Bolt? &#147;It already does&#148; Hartsman 
                  replied facetiously, &#147;just turn your spell effects back 
                  on&#148; (turns out their Boss is a Lightning Bolt Afficianado 
                  and its slated for a graphic change in PoP). They complained 
                  of the Ghost haunting the current code and promised that the 
                  new expanded coding for PoP would make certain changes much 
                  more controllable. When asked about the upcoming port to the 
                  Mac Hartsman replied &#147;Yes we are writing for Korean, German, 
                  French and the Mac&#148;. At the one hour mark they seemed to 
                  run out of gas and got the glazed expressions of people camping 
                  the AC or folks prepping in Maestro&#146;s room for the Second 
                  Floor or even camping Ragefire. &#147;NO we are not upping the 
                  time on Ragefire spawns&#148; replied Barker, &#147;The cleric 
                  epic is a very powerful item and a spawn every three days is 
                  more then enough.&#148;. Three days? Hmm. Anyways the session 
                  wound on down and they seemed drained as folks started shuffling 
                  out. Not many proceeded forward to confront the spawned pair 
                  but I knew this was my chance.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
                  could tell by his expression that the Hastings was worn. He 
                  had reached into his pocket and pulled out a Smudge Stick of 
                  Tranquility and began answering the questions of some folks 
                  who had stayed to Hail him. I paid no attention to the conversations 
                  of the first two folks near him but waited. They would wear 
                  him down more, make the mob more tractable, weak, make him slip 
                  up and profess that there was no God but Cazic. I was about 
                  to pounce when a female came up to the Hastings. He recognized 
                  her name and lit her Smudge Stick of Tranquility while hearing 
                  her petition. It seemed that she, a 54th or 55th season wood 
                  elf druid, had gone to sleep one night and arose from her slumber 
                  no longer a B cup but a Double E and had lost her pants and 
                  was wearing a thong. The Hastings replied, &#147;Hmm and there 
                  is something wrong with this?&#148; She bemoaned her lack of 
                  pants, the Hastings continued to insist that she had nice legs 
                  but finally gave in and said that he would look in his laundry 
                  basket for a pair that might fit her. I of course refrained 
                  from interrupting this she was indeed blonde and seemed to be 
                  taking the last of the fight out of this beast. When she finished 
                  I approached and began with a defensive move. I disarmed him 
                  by beginning with I am like the new UI but well&#133;can I perchance 
                  get some books of knowledge? I was happy with its flexibility 
                  but I did not have all the proper words to summon forth its 
                  true power. He started to inform me of the scrolls but I proceeded 
                  to show him my copy of it which he showed him that Aye I was 
                  not just dabbling but serious. I inquired of the move ability 
                  of certain items and was informed that as I suspected they were 
                  indeed branded onto certain areas as they were not locations 
                  per se but a class composed of functions and links. I inquired 
                  further whether the Default file was the location for certain 
                  items and whether it was accessible, where upon he acknowledged 
                  that he was truly happy to get the UI out but it was not yet 
                  working as intended. He did note that they should include the 
                  accessible scrying words in future tome releases but that there 
                  was no design document listing them. After answering my questions 
                  he inquired the time noticing my Gnomish Tocking Device and 
                  I informed him. He was further saved when he asked where they 
                  were supposed to be and I also told him that they had been summoned 
                  to dine at least 30 minutes before.</font></p>
                <p><span class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                  followed the Hastings and the Barker as they pathed again up 
                  towards the Gathering Hall. While I had successfully gotten 
                  the answers I needed from one there was still something distressing 
                  me. My opportunity arose when the Barker went into an alley 
                  to see a Crimson Hand about a horse. I knew that alley was a 
                  Dead End so awaited his return. After hailing him by name and 
                  asking if a question I could ask (to which he nodded) I proceeded 
                  to gibber out uhm Gilligan and the rest &#133; the rest of (my 
                  mind and body had become jello like by this time of the day 
                  so I emoted a half height thing with my left hand) the little 
                  ones ahhh the gnomish translocators might they be reappearing? 
                  Gilligans he inquired? Why Yes I had been in OOT for a week 
                  and the one there was always swimming around the Lagoon of Sisters 
                  Isle. I believe he smiled briefly before expressing his discontent 
                  if not hatred with the Norrathian Port Authority but stated 
                  that they were there just as a backup for when the Big Ships 
                  went down. I left him with the thought that if the big ships 
                  didn&#146;t work and the gnomes would? After all they were already 
                  on site no? I stood and watched as the Hartsman and the Barker 
                  made their way into the Hall of the Gathering they seemed weak 
                  and drained and both appeared haunted by a calling from Innorouk 
                  and knew it was time for me to get out of the enemy encampment.<br>

                  night's raid to City of Mist was a lot of fun, although anyone 
                  given a list of the events would find it hard to believe--relatively 
                  little experience, no loot, and a near total party wipe out. 
                  Guess you had to be there 8). </span></font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Actually, 
                  Beringer got far more experience than I thought he would (about 
                  one gold bub). Considering that there were two groups and that 
                  the main was in the other group, I assumed they would get the 
                  lion's share of experience. I didn't pay strict attention, but 
                  I would venture to guess that the group I was in actually got 
                  experience credit for most of the kills (and no, I'm not delusional 
                  enough to think that was because Beringer was in the group). 
                  </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                  the interest of accuracy, there WAS loot. Sarenia got a very 
                  nice shield. I'm not sure what dropped off the major mob we 
                  killed (Neh' someone or other), nor do I know how much cash 
                  got looted, but I'm also thinking it would be fair and logical 
                  for all the coin to go into the guild bank to recuperate (at 
                  least in part), the expense of all those jade inlaid coffins 
                  we had to buy....which is a nice segue to the near total party 
                  wipe out... </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maybe 
                  I thought the collossal battle was cool because Beringer was 
                  one of only two survivors, but I think it had classic elements 
                  that would make it exciting in anyone's book. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlier 
                  we had fought our way to Neh' and engaged him in battle on a 
                  sky walk hovering far above the City of Mist. The battle went 
                  very well and Neh' was down to about one bub when things went 
                  wrong. The main got feared and ran off the walkway, and Neh' 
                  himself got pushed over the edge under the sustained blows of 
                  the party. Fearing a massive train, we camped out, came back 
                  in and descended (thanks to the Dead Man Floating buffs) down 
                  to earth. We would have to do the entire thing again. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                  took a while to regroup, but we fought our way back up to the 
                  walkway, where Neh' had returned to bide his time. This time, 
                  rather than fight on the walkway and risk falling, we decided 
                  to pull Neh' to a recently cleared tower. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neh' 
                  was tougher the second time around, perhaps because he had had 
                  time to buff himself, including a very nasty damage shield. 
                  Neh' didn't hit Beringer more than two or three times the entire 
                  battle, but Ber lost massive hp from the damage shield (unlike 
                  any damage shield he's ever encountered). I do recall, as well, 
                  that Neh' was down to nearly one bub when the sob healed himself 
                  up to about four bubs of health, talk about depressing. By that 
                  time too I was wondering how much mana the healers had left. 
                  Nevertheless, it was clear that Neh's minutes were numbered. 
                  That's when the tower room began to respawn. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
                  it respawned very rapidly. Goos and wraiths and phantoms and 
                  golems began to appear all around us. Neh' fell, but there was 
                  no time for celebration. The casters had locked down the many 
                  new arrivals, but we had just come out of a major clash. Mez 
                  began to wear off some of the earlier spawns as new ones arrived. 
                  This did not bode well. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                  I recall correctly, Fenelane was the first to go down. I have 
                  no idea what Fenelan is, but I'm guessing she is an enchanter? 
                  If so, we lost valuable and desperately needed mezzing capacity. 
                  Who fell in what order after that is a bit of a blur, but I 
                  recall hearing a scream and seeing the text message that Sarenia 
                  had died. That caused a chill to run down my spine. Even worse, 
                  I saw that our melees were losing health, despite Rezzana's 
                  amazing efforts. Spyderz necro pet was gone and his health was 
                  very low. Rezzana had sustained massive damage, but continued 
                  to heal the fighters rather than herself. Much to my horror 
                  I saw Eldeberon down to under one bub of health...the great 
                  Eldeberon!? I had never seen Eldeberon suffer injury, let alone 
                  perch on the brink of destruction. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, 
                  I thought to myself, this is what a very, very bad situation 
                  looks like. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                  slew many a mob, but they just kept coming, and one by one, 
                  my comrades were falling to the horde. I had no idea of the 
                  status of group two, but the Verds were still on their feet 
                  and fighting (tough Dwarves that they are), but their precise 
                  condition I did not know. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                  the midst of the battle, there was another conflict, one raging 
                  in Beringer's mind. On one side was the intention to fight to 
                  the end, going down with my fellows. On the other side was a 
                  voice saying, &quot;All is lost, make a run for it!&quot; I 
                  had watched the command messages closely, and though I might 
                  have missed it, I do not think anyone at any time called for 
                  a retreat. What to do? </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                  don't know if the voice in Beringer's head was sanity or cowardice, 
                  prudence or self-interest, but he ran. I knew he could not get 
                  far, but wanted him away from the tower. He kicked open the 
                  door and ran out onto the sky walkway and successfully feigned 
                  death. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His 
                  entire platoon was dead, but much to his delight, he saw the 
                  Verds come running out of the tower onto the walkway, they sailed 
                  off into the sky (dead man floating still in effect). &quot;Run, 
                  Verds, run!&quot; Berigner thought as he lay there. But would 
                  they make it out of the gates of the city? </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beringer 
                  was safe for the moment, but there was little satisfaction in 
                  it and quite a bit of guilty feeling. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                  was not easy to get out of the city. When the walkway was relatively 
                  clear, Beringer got up and lept over the edge into space. Immediately 
                  he was struck by spells and blows. He feigned death in mid-air 
                  and gently floated to the roof top of the arena below. He waited 
                  several minutes, got up and ran again. Again the mobs came rushing 
                  out from what seemed like no where. In the courtyard he once 
                  again feigned death. As he lay there, fearing to even breath 
                  unless he alert the mobs to the fact that he actually lived, 
                  he spied a horrifying sight that nearly crushed his spirit: 
                  the broken and mangled bodies of the Verds. They had not survived. 
                  </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beringer 
                  made his way out of the city struggling to make headway: get 
                  up and run, suffer sustained attack, feign dead, wait, mend 
                  and then repeat. Little by little he made his way toward the 
                  city gates until he was close enough to sprint for the exit 
                  and find refuge in the Emerald Jungle. </font></p>

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

                  got my pictures developed from our weekend camping trip to the 
                  moon. Islar had to work late that day, but we got on the road 
                  without too much of a delay. As usual we had a few too many 
                  beers and almost got pulled over at the Nexus Custom Authority, 
                  but thank goodness Sarenia was driving. We arrived in Grimling 
                  forest where we had a terrible lunch at the &quot;Grimling Bar 
                  &amp; Grill&quot; (worst service in the world). But they did 
                  have beer, so it wasn't a total loss. We were happy to say goodbye 
                  to the land of the Grimlings and traveled though Tenebrous Mts. 
                  The Mountians were very disappointing, really just little hills. 
                  We did some hiking anyway, but the bats and the wolves were 
                  a pain, and we were out of beer, so we made a detour to Katta.

                  lantern lit stone streets, stone bridges and walkways. The shops 
                  are great and Sarenia and Rezzana went off to do some shopping, 
                  while Beringer and I wandered around and took in some of the

                  had the Katta Sea Shrimp, which was very good, and Beringer 
                  I think had the Katta Hot and Spicey Grimling Toes, which after 
                  having traveled through there, he relished. It was getting late 
                  and we needed to get moving and find a campsite. We ended up 
                  getting lost in the city for about an hour. We had one of those 
                  cheap city maps you get at the tourist information booth, and 
                  all the markings were in ancient Combine! Doh! While lost, I 
                  was harassed by one of the local police--who honestly I think 
                  was seriously into profiling dark elves. I looked around and 
                  since we were alone on the street, I killed him, and dumped 
                  his body over the wall into the sea. Got a nice sword off him 
                  too. We eventually found our way out and descended down the 
                  long stair to the Twilight Sea. This place was beautiful and 
                  fun to explore. We came across this really cool castle, and 
                  Beringer and I checked it out.</font></p>

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
                  Beringer this is known as the &quot;Castle of Death &amp; Lazy 
                  Guards&quot; as he was left to die while the local police just 
                  watched. Apparently, we didn't pay the exhibit fee to see the 
                  castle and without it the guards were not require to aid us 
                  against theft, injury or death by manically evil spirits. Anyway, 
                  we wandered around the forests and coastline, swimming a little 
                  until we came to where the desert canyons rose up. This was 
                  the entrance to the Scarlet Desert, and looked really cool. 
                  It was getting late so we decided to it was best to camp here 
                  for the night. We had no idea if we were allowed to camp there, 
                  but there were no guards around so we did anyway.</font></p>

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                  is a shot of us setting up one of our first campsites on the 
                  shore of the Twilight Sea. You can see Beringer having trouble 
                  setting up the tent. He forgot the tent stakes, which he swears 
                  was in the bag with the tent. Thank god there wasn't much of 
                  a wind that night. We still had some of the Katta Dark Ale we 
                  bought in the city, and we kept it cool in the sea water. Soon 
                  we had a nice fire going and watched the planet of Norrath descending 
                  as we lay in our sleeping bags, and Sarenia and Rezzana showed 
                  us what they bought in town. The next day we entered the desert 
                  and had fun killing anything that moved. It was a beautiful, 
                  although a bit of a hot day. We discovered a trail and hiked 
                  to the top where we found the set for the original Universal 
                  Studios Star Trek television series. We were informed this was 
                  the same set used in the episode where Mr. Spock goes nuts on 
                  Vulcan and fights Kirk in front of Tapow with those odd axe 
                  weapons. We saw some other tourists walking around with some 
                  of these souveginer axes so I killed one and took it for myself.

                  fact we remained at the Universal Stuidos tour killing a lot 
                  of other tourists, little guys dressed up in alien costumes--trekky 
                  geeks obviously. They eventually got mad at us, so we left. 
                  We traveled south to where the tourist guidebook said we'd find 
                  local tribal villagers, that promised a real authentic Desert 
                  experience. When we got there most were hocking pottery, and 
                  carved driftwood, and the rest were trying to kill us.</font></p>

                  convinced this local villager to let us take his picture. It 
                  of course stole his soul, and we had to kill him soon after. 
                  We found a lake and went swimming to cool off. After that came 
                  Greigs End and the Grey, but I was too scared to take out my 
                  camera there. </font></p>

                  it was fun. </font></p>

                  in an attempt to look fierce, but it slipped from his fingers 
                  and clattered on the stone. He picked it up quickly and glanced 
                  up at the others. Rezzana, the elven cleric, smiled at him, 
                  and the warrior blushed noticeably. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brodda 
                  stood up on his toes and leaned forward peering into the torch 
                  lit gloom. The ancient hallway that marked the first portion 
                  of the east wing of Howling Stones was marred with rock and 
                  rubble, the remains of a long past, long forgotten empire. &quot;Refresh 
                  my memory,&quot; the gnome thief said nervously, &quot;I don't 
                  think I've been this far before. What lies ahead?&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  wizard Eldeberon placed a hand on Brodda's shoulder and pointed 
                  ahead. &quot;Do you see there, on the broken wall, that shattered 
                  skeleton that looks twisted as if it died in great anguish?&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brodda 
                  nodded with a grimace on his face. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That 
                  was Indra.&quot; The wizard explained. &quot;Now look over there. 
                  Do you see that leg bone sticking out of the killer pit trap? 
                  That's all that was left of Toolan the Mage. And if you look 
                  between that scorch mark and that bloodstain over there you 
                  will see a single crushed Iksar skull-that was the shaman Klothe.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brodda 
                  swallowed hard. &quot;What is the large pile of bones beyond 
                  the trapped rug?&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That's

                  to call you something bad, but the worst thing I can come up

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
                  think Verd's right, and there may be a few more Indras around

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                  had been a long time since the intrepid adventurers first broke 
                  into the dungeon known as Howling Stones. Since that time they 
                  had come to know its many secrets and mysteries and fought their 
                  way through north, west and even the infamous south wings, but 
                  they had yet to uncover the legendary final resting place of 
                  the Iksar queen rumored to be entomb there. Only one wing of 
                  the crypt remained untouched-east. All previous attempts to 
                  explore its depths proved lethal, and forced the party back. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="Normal">Over 
                  the years the adventurers had recruited fresh faces in their 
                  quest to breech the dungeon. Indra became a regular, and trusted 
                  scout. Klothe had replaced Cabbz as shaman, and a whole host 
                  of melees had marched through including Siladadar, Uniqe, Chronnug, 
                  Raeoen, Tryssa, Drukinpionch, and Sacik, and a few casters like 
                  Dhramasala, Jarok, Teroth and Toolan. Rezzana, Sarenia's young 
                  niece joined the band as a regular and soon became infatuated 
                  with the heroic bravado of Verdirillian's warrior son, who found 
                  himself falling in love with the delicate, refined, but headstrong 
                  girl. Brodda, began attending the crypt expeditions, and was 
                  welcome for his lock picking, and incredible damage as well 
                  as his good humor. </span></font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whenever 
                  possible the group would gear up and climb down the treacherous 
                  chasm in Overthere and enter the great crypt. They set up base 
                  camps at the entrance, with the usual canvas tents and ventured 
                  into each wing. Except east. East was the last and hardest of 
                  the quadrants. Reachable only by traveling first through south, 
                  the teams was stymied by two full rooms of monsters that would 
                  attack when anyone came near. Anyone except a level 60 however. 
                  Once this was discovered the key to East was discovered, and 
                  the team pushed into East itself. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  initial room was easy to handle, and the drop down through the 
                  tapestry simple, but then the valiant band was faced with the 
                  Hall of Death. A short corridor with a pit trap and a T intersection 
                  that opened up to two different and dangerous area. Mobs in 
                  the hall pop fast, and can often aggro the contents of either 
                  room to the left or right of the T. They had tried many times, 
                  but always either the team would wipe, near wipe, or loose a 
                  party member to the pit. It was almost believed impossible to 
                  break and then&#133;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Go 
                  head and pull Brodda,&quot; Eldeberon told the gnome who silently 
                  nodded and with a deep breath bravely moved forward. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Go 
                  slow, be careful. Go slow, be careful. Go slow, be careful.&quot; 
                  Brodda muttered to himself as he agilely slipped around the 
                  broken rubble that was once a wall, taking great pains not to 
                  step on any of Indra's bones. He stuck to the shadows and crept 
                  past the pit grimacing at Toolan's still slippered foot. &quot;Go 
                  slow, be careful. Go slow, be careful.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
                  was at the intersection. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Which 
                  way?&quot; He called back.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Take 
                  the right door,&quot; Eldeberon replied, his voice echoing through 
                  the twisting corridor. &quot;And remember Brodda, the key to 
                  pulling is feign death.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brodda 
                  could hear the wizard chuckling, and then the rest of them talking 
                  in quiet tones. Their muffled voices carrying to him, bouncing 
                  off the stones. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Yeah, 
                  Verdrillian taught me that trick,&quot; Verdicus said. &quot;It 
                  is real easy to Feign Death when the cleric doesn't heal you!&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You 
                  know I told your mother you were going trouble the moment we

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
                  would never let you die,&quot; Rezzana told him and batted her 
                  eyes, then turned and gave a withering glance at the elder dwarf, 
                  who shrugged. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Women,&quot;

                  do you mean?&quot; Verdicus asked. &quot;We could be holding

                  screams as they-&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Brodda,&quot;

                  deftly opened the door and peered through the crack. Skeletons. 
                  He silently withdrew a dagger. &quot;Get ready,&quot; he told 
                  the others, and with one quick flick of his wrist sent the dagger 
                  flying through the narrow opening. The dagger broke one of the 
                  skeletons ribs, and immediately the undead bones moved to attack.</font></p>

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  gnome reached the broken wall with the skeleton in hot pursuit. 
                  Without pause he flung himself over the wall and rolled to his 
                  feet his Bloodpoint out and ready. Only one skeleton pursued 
                  him, and Verdicus was there is an instant his axe crushing the 
                  skeleton's shoulder. This got the creatures attention away from 
                  the thief who shifted around behind the monster. Blows landed 
                  on the skeleton over and over, then the wizard let got a series 
                  of magical blasts and the living dead crumpled to the floor 
                  in pieces. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That's 
                  one,&quot; Eldeberon said. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They 
                  repeated the process twice more then the party moved forward. 
                  This time however, Eldeberon had an idea and called for everyone 
                  to rush through the Hall of Death into the recently cleared 
                  area to the right of the T. Another monster was killed there, 
                  then Brodda set out again to see what lay ahead. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Woot!&quot; 
                  Verd said. &quot;Never been this far! New territory!&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ready 
                  for four?&quot; Brodda asked. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Can 
                  we get less?&quot; Eldeberon asked. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Don't 
                  think so&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Then 
                  yes.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brodda 
                  threw another dagger and several powerful animated skeletons 
                  chased him back to the waiting party. Sarenia quickly began 
                  her incantations and soon a blue glow formed about the creatures 
                  stopping them in their tracks. Verdicus planted his feet and 
                  began swinging away like a lumberjack trimming out dead wood. 
                  </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Die 
                  you wretched beasts!&quot; He cried.<br>
                  &quot;Verd?&quot; Verdrillian said. &quot;First off, they are 
                  already dead, and second do you see ears on any of them?&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Soon 
                  there was a pile of bones where killer skeletons once stood, 
                  and at Eldeberon's urging the party wasted no time pushing deeper. 
                  </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  heavy dusty scent of the corridor grew thicker as they careful 
                  crept forward. Ahead, Brodda peered around corners, then seeing 
                  the way clear would silently wave them forward. The party would 
                  then rush up behind him and huddle, panting with excitement 
                  and dread. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They 
                  entered into a large H shaped room and cleared it easily of 
                  the handful of skeleton defenders, then they were on once more 
                  into a corridor where they fought off hordes of undead guardians 
                  and Golems.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Which

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Hang 
                  on.&quot; The wizard said, and standing up incarnated a spell 
                  that summoned forth a wondrous floating eye. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Oh 
                  man! Eww. That is so gross!&quot; Verd said. &quot;I have one 
                  word or you, Visine.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  eye left the room and scouted ahead as Eldeberon sat concentrating 
                  on controlling the hovering eye. Then the Wizard seemed to sigh.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Brodda, 
                  my friend,&quot; he began in a frighteningly serious tone. &quot;We 
                  are reaching the end of this crypt. There is but one room left. 
                  However&#133;&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  gnome didn't like the sound of the &quot;however&quot;.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
                  room is filled with four closely packed Montifurous Golems. 
                  I have no idea if you can single pull down here, or if Sarenia 
                  can mez them in time.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I 
                  will try my best,&quot; Brodda said bravely. </font></p>

                  a good gnome, Brodda.&quot; El patted the thief on the shoulder. 
                  &quot;Let's take position at the end of this hall.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  crypt was deathly silent as the Brodda crept forward. The eyes 
                  of his fellowship on his back, the faint heavy breathing of 
                  the golems before him. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Why 
                  did I say I would try?&quot; He asked himself, holding his bloodpoint 
                  in one sweaty little hand. &quot;This is really gonna hurt I 
                  know it.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Inch 
                  by inch the gnome slipped closer, and closer and pushed the 
                  door open. It creaked with age. He peered in. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAM!<br>
                  A monsterous brute nine feet tall, with clay for skin slammed 
                  poor Brodda against the wall with a single swing of his massive 
                  hand. Brodda slumped to the stone dazed. He got to his feet.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAM! 
                  <br>
                  Another brute hammered the little gnome and sent him sliding 
                  across the crypt rocks. With blood blurring his vision Brodda 
                  staggered forward running for his life back to his friends. 
                  His head reeled, his left arm was hanging useless at his side, 
                  his legs weak and unsure.</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Brodda! 
                  Oh no Brodda!&quot; the gnome could hear the voices coming as 
                  if out of a fog. Cries of fear and horror. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAM! 
                  WHAM!<br>
                  It was hard to breath. The little thief was on his knees. Mountains 
                  of red clay surrounding him. He was surprised they he could 
                  no longer hear anything, but his sight was very clear, as if 
                  the whole event was cast in slow motion. Verdicus had come to 
                  his aid and was attacking, but being slammed hard. Sarenia was 
                  casting some spell, with a frantic look upon her face, mouthing 
                  his name as if pleading for his safety. Rez and Verdrillian 
                  were also on their feet praying hard. But it was Eldeberon Brodda 
                  focused on. The wizard stood up. He looked pitifully on the 
                  thief and began a massive spell that cast out huge circles of 
                  blue and green light. Brodda had seen his attack spells before, 
                  and this wasn't one. This was&#133;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAM!</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Brodda, 
                  Brodda? How many fingers do you see pal?&quot; It was Verdillian 
                  standing above him. <br>
                  &quot;Huh? Where am I?&quot; Brodda looked around feeling incredibly 
                  weak, and embarrassed to discover he was naked. Surrounding 
                  him were Eldeberon, and the Verds, while Rez and Sarenia discretely 
                  turned away. </font></p>

                  minutes or so.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But

                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sorry 
                  guys,&quot; Brodda said dressing. </font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;No 
                  problem, Brodda,&quot; Eldeberon said. &quot;Next time we'll 
                  just need to bring a FD puller. Someone like&#133;oh I don't 
                  know&#133;Jarok maybe.&quot;</font></p>
                <p class="Normal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Com'on, 
                  lets get out of this whole!&quot; Verd said. &quot;And don't

                  Jarok did indeed join the adventurers only a few days later,

                  the rear pops caught up to us too soon, and once again we evaced.

                <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="Normal">Spent 
                last night and part of this morning in Greig's end. It started 
                innocently enough, some Chow wanted to explore a zone that had 
                awful loot and less than exciting experience. Our first crawl 
                ended in a room with a dark blue mob who single handedly decimated 
                a full group of Chow.</span></font> 
                <p class="Normal">Only a single member of the group survived, 
                  gating when all had been lost to mark this mob as the target 
                  of the Dragonchow revenge. As the group gathered in PoK in preparation 
                  for the corpse retrieval run, an old friend sent a tell asking 
                  how are you? Upon explaining our plight, he replies, aye that 
                  is a bad place to die. Undaunted, the Chow set to again, but 
                  naked and perpetually low on mana it was slow going back to 
                  the site of the massacre. Upon arriving, a very enraged mob 
                  stood at the zone in and another round of deaths occurred.</p>
                <p class="Normal">Then when things seemed bleakest, the old friend 
                  appeared and help set things back in motion. The crew of seven 
                  began working their way back to the bodies, in a painfully slow 
                  manner. After what seemed like hours and positive that rez timers 
                  would have passed, our intrepid monk had us at the last courtyard 
                  before the mad brewers room. He began pulling out the corpses, 
                  and our cleric began clicking us back to the glory with which 
                  we had started.</p>
                <p class="Normal">Now, at last, revenge will be ours we cried! 
                  But the cowardly devastator of the Chow team had gone into hiding 
                  and our revenge was thought lost. What to do we asked? Why we 
                  shall continue to explore this unsettling zone and hope that 
                  our nemesis returns to accept the judgment of the Chow and be 
                  found lacking.</p>
                <p class="Normal">At some point here, what happens gets blurry 
                  as anxious times do, we lost two of our original team and they 
                  were quickly replaced by two more brave Chow ready to carry 
                  our proud banner to the end of Greig's end. Again, we look for 
                  the monster who so devastated our ranks, and this time he appears 
                  back in his study, mocking us. We make haste back to the spot 
                  where he caused us such pain. We resolutely fight through a 
                  sea of minions to the spot now etched into our minds as the 
                  place where retribution must occur. When we arrive though, he 
                  has gone again leaving only his household maid to meet the Chow 
                  and their ire. While, she is well trained in the arts of killing, 
                  she is not strong enough to stand against the Chow. Our reward 
                  is a strange and wonderful broom???</p>
                <p class="Normal">We press on, our quest for revenge not satiated. 
                  Our adventurous spirits pushing us deeper into this strange 
                  and unsettling place. When suddenly our tracker cries, hes back!! 
                  Back to the site of our revenge we battle, with a new sense 
                  of urgency, an undying need to meet this challenger to the Chow 
                  and make him face us again, now fully prepared for his power 
                  and deceit. In a battle for which ballads are written and sung 
                  the Chow stand firm in their resolution to have revenge on this 
                  man. A strange calm falls on the Chow as they face this menace, 
                  we work as one and the evil presence falls. Victory is ours, 
                  revenge has been had and the spoils of the battle are ours to 
                  be had. What reward does this battle bring? Ironically, or perhaps 
                  not, the reward is an eccentric mask with the simple, but obscure 
                  name of Beer Goggles.</p>
                <p class="Normal">This strange device is used to summon ale and 
                  we drink to the victory and the revenge we have wrought. In 
                  our revelry we decide to continue to explore, now perhaps drunk 
                  on ale or on the victory we have won. This decision may show 
                  the very essence of the Chow, when others might be satisfied 
                  with their accomplishment the Chow press on. Deeper we go, to 
                  the very deepest point we have stood here in Greig's End. And 
                  it is here that things go very very wrong.</p>
                <p class="Normal">This place is so strange, so bizarre and so 
                  very quickly deadly. It was a simple fight, but as the monster 
                  in this zone are able to pick up on the essence of that which 
                  is good they are keenly attracted to our healer. In the blink 
                  of an eye its over and our healer lies dead. Shall we succor? 
                  Leave our fallen comrade in arms and make haste to our own safety? 
                  Nay we say, we shall fight our way out and bring our friend's 
                  corpse with us, as it should be. We shall leave no one behind! 
                </p>
                <p class="Normal">What follows is not unlike the entire adventure. 
                  A seemingly endless string of foes. Brought in ones and twos 
                  to meet their fate at the hands of a beleaguered band of Chow. 
                  The Chow are fatigued now, struggling to maintain their legendary 
                  discipline. And the amount of ground covered by the now unbalanced 
                  group is very impressive. However, it is not to be the end of 
                  this tale. A spell falls short, the group is once again faced 
                  by the utter disaster of overwhelming odds. The Chow fall again 
                  this eve, nearly halfway back to their goal of safety.</p>
                <p class="Normal">Less devoted team members might falter here, 
                  but they did not. Grimly, we gather again at the zone in of 
                  Greig's End. Naked, battered, but not beaten we press forward 
                  once again. Our cagey monk continues his endless assault to 
                  return to the Chow funeral pyre bringing a nearly infinite string 
                  of bizarre monsters to meet the resolute Chow band and their 
                  ultimate fate, death. </p>
                <p class="Normal">The most noteworthy of these monsters causes 
                  darkness to fall upon the band. In this most cowardly act, it 
                  hopes to undermine the very foundation of this group. To cause 
                  them to flee this place, groping unseeing through the keep to 
                  be destroyed separated and alone. This is perhaps the most telling 
                  event of the adventure. Unable to see or even to communicate 
                  with each other the Chow fight on as of a single mind. Casters 
                  use their hearing to locate and time their spells and melee 
                  use their hearing to target a engage the unseen monster. After 
                  what seems like an eternity this group stands over body of their 
                  dead foe, once again seeing, but always knowing their companions 
                  hearts.</p>
                <p><span class="Normal">Is it any wonder that this tale ends easily? 
                  The Chow finish fighting to their bodies, they are ressurected 
                  one by one and then they gather and magically port to the Plane 
                  of Knowledge. They are battered, fatigued, but smiling. There 
                  is no great reward for this adventure other than the experience 
                  and the few platinum pieces they found on the way. But, for 
                  this adventurer the Greig's End adventure is the epitome of 
                  why he joined this fine guild. This is his Norrathian family 
                  and this tale will live forever in his soul.</span></p>
