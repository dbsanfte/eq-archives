        <p><font size="5">Dragonchow Code of Conduct</font></p>
        <p> <font size="2"></font>We expect a certain demeanor and adult behavior 
          from all of our guild members. We expect you to treat others as you 
          would wish to be treated. We do NOT expect political correctness. You 
          want to be silly, be silly. You want to be sarcastic, be sarcastic. 
          You want to be stupid, be stupid. BUT there are limits. While we expect 
          you to know what they are, we the officers present to you the following 
          Guidelines, but remind you it is ultimately in the discretion of the 
          officers to decide where the lines are drawn or for you to convince 
          us otherwise.</p>
        <p><br>
          Below are basic guidelines we expect our members to follow.<br>
          Violation of any can lead to disciplinary action up to and including 
          immediate removal from the guild. </p>
        <p>1) All members should remember that Dragonchow is about fun and friendship 
          first, loot and experience second. We are a family NOT a gang.</p>
        <p>2) Engagement in any activity that is violation of the EverQuest End 
          User License Agreement (EULA) which would reflect on the status of or 
          lead to the disbanding of Dragonchow as a recognized Guild is grounds 
          for immediate removal. </p>
        <p>3) No guild member shall harass another member/player, sexually, verbally, 
          physically or through game play. This does not mean that banter is unacceptable, 
          we are talking about harassment that is done with absolute, mean, cold 
          and cruel intentions. Harassment will be treated extremely seriously 
          and is grounds for immediate removal.</p>
        <p>4) Members should try and keep any obscene and or offensive comments 
          out of any form of chat. Try and keep it PG rated or at least just R. 
          The use of profanity while generally tolerable should be saved for the 
          times that really, really call for it. You should try to use Damn, Grr, 
          Aigh, Frig or something else, but we do recognize that there are times 
          you just need to let loose. Try and keep these occasions as the rare 
          not the norm.</p>
        <p>5) Members will respect each other. Personal attacks won&#146;t be 
          tolerated in game or on the message boards. Swearing at or insulting 
          a person are examples of unacceptable behavior. If there is a dispute 
          between members, it should be taken out of /guild to /tells and if necessary 
          taken to an officer in game or in a chat room. You should try and resolve 
          these calmly, coolly and as adults. </p>
        <p>6) Members will respect others. Dragonchow wishes to be a well respected 
          member of the Saryrn Guild community, as a member you are a representative 
          of Chow. Always remember this whether you are in /tells, /shouts, /ooc 
          or just speaking to another player be it member, newbie, or a combatant. 
          Always behave courteously, calmly and respectfully, treating them as 
          you would a fellow guildie. Should they be rude, obnoxious or otherwise 
          offensive, simply ignore them if you can and remember their name so 
          as not to have anything to do with them in the future. We don&#146;t 
          stoop to someone else&#146;s level as it just demeans us, and gives 
          them the attention that they want. The best revenge for a person like 
          that is to deny them the attention.</p>
        <p>7) Members will be helpful if they can. Dragonchow wishes to be respected 
          for its competence, knowledge and honor. Be aware of your surroundings 
          and be aware of others around you. Be willing to lend aid to those in 
          need whether its throwing a heal, breaking a train, answering questions 
          or offering directions. This can also include being helpful simply in 
          /shout or /ooc. It isn&#146;t required that you endow the college fund 
          of their first born or hold their hand for the next hour, but remember 
          the person you help today might be the person helping you tomorrow.</p>
        <p>8 ) Members are NOT Bullies. If you wish to engage in /duels do so 
          for fun NOT to beat people up. Try to engage in fair fights only to 
          test your skill. By the same token we do NOT take over a camp just because 
          we have the power to do so nor do we use our power just to puff up our 
          own ego&#146;s at someone else&#146;s expense. Bullying is grounds for 
          immediate removal.</p>
        <p>9) No guild member shall engage in Ninja Looting. Guild members will 
          be fair and honest in their splits. Clerics will get compensated for 
          their symbol costs and Enchanters for their Runes before the take is 
          calculated. On items members will be honest whether its Need or Greed.</p>
        <p>10) No guild member shall engage in Kill Stealing. </p>
        <p>11) No guild member shall intentionally train a player. Intentionally 
          training someone is grounds for immediate removal. If you are pulling 
          a train to the zone/guards you should try and shout an appropriate warning, 
          if possible. If you accidentally train someone, you should make necessary 
          amends, the least of which are apologies. </p>
        <p>12) No member will invoke the Play Nice Policy in regards to a camp. 
          If the issue cannot be resolved amicably between the 2 parties, then 
          its sometimes best to just walk away. This does not mean you should 
          permit yourself to be bullied off a camp, or that you should not call 
          for GM or Guild intervention, it does mean that we recognize that if 
          the camp is taken there are a ton of other places we can go. If you 
          have a problem or aren&#146;t sure what to do feel free to ask in /guild 
          or ask an officer. </p>
        <p>13) Members are expected to try and set a fair market price if selling 
          in guild. We recognize that there are times you need cash and times 
          you just need to get rid of an item. If you need the cash then the fellow 
          guildie should respect that you need to sell it in Freeport vs to them 
          regardless of how badly they want it. When selling an item any guild 
          member that knowingly or willingly is involved as part of a scam to 
          defraud, dupe or otherwise deceive another player, regardless of reason, 
          shall be immediately removed from the guild.</p>
        <p>14) All guild members are expected to help out other guild members 
          in need. Whether its CR, item transfers, ports, resses, etc&#133; This 
          does not mean abandoning a group in the bottom of a dungeon to run halfway 
          across Norrath. It does mean if you are soloing and nearby and able 
          to you should offer to help if you can. It does mean that if you can 
          leave your group, pop over to another character and safely help and 
          then get back to your group in minimal time you should consider offering 
          to help. This is after all one of the reason we are in a guild. By the 
          same token members should not ask for help unless they really need it.</p>
        <p>15) The Officers will handle each case of conduct violations as it 
          warrants, but like in real life 3 strikes and your out. </p>
        <p><br>
          Should you have any questions concerning these guidelines please feel 
          free to ask in /Guild or on the boards. </p>
